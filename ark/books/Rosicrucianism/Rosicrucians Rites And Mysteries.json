The Producers — particularly in the instance of this much - enlarged present Edition — are particularly desirous that no one shall identify them with, or consider them as maintaining personally, the strangely abstruse, and, in some instances, t he startlingly singular ideas of these Princes among the Mystics. We are — and desire to be viewed as — the His - torians only of this renowned Body; of whom it may most truly be asserted that no one can bost of having ever — really and in fact — seen or known in a ny age any supposed (or suspected), “Member” in the flesh. It is sufficient honour to offer as the medium only, or the Intermediaries to the reading world — of this Illustrious Membership; whose renown has filled, and whose mystical doctrines (assumed or su pposed), have puzzled the ages; — in the intenser degree, still, in the present time; as the inquisitive reception of the Authors’ First Edition of the “Rosicru - cians” abundantly proved. Dr. Ginsburg says of the Cabala, or Kabbalah (regarding the mysteries o f which the Rosicrucians claimed to be the only true exponents), that it is a system of religious philo - sophy, or more properly of theosophy, which has not only exercised, for hundreds of years, an extraordinary influence on the mental development of so sh rewd a people as the Jews, but has captivated the minds of some of the greatest t"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PREFACE viii thinkers of Christendom in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. “It — and all that refers to it” — therefore claims the greatest attention of both the philosopher and the theo - logian. “The thinkers of the past days, after restlessly searching for a scientific system which should disclose to them the ‘deepest depths’ of the Divine Nature, and ap - prove to the understanding the real tie which binds all things together, found the craving of their mind SATISFIED by this Theosophy.” We say enough in reference to the august possessors of this knowledge when we remind the reader that among those who knew how to wield (and to adapt), the stupen - dous acquisition to which they were suppos ed to have at last penetrated, were — Raymond Lully, the celebrated scholastic, metaphysician, and chemist (died 1315 ); John Reuchlin, the renowned scholar and reviver of oriental literature in Europe (born 1455 , died 1522 ); John Picus di Mirandola, the fam ous philosopher and classical scholar ( 1463 – 1594 ); Cornelius Henry Agrippa, the distinguished philosopher, divine, and physician ( 1486 – 1535 ); John Baptist van Helmont, a remarkable chemist and physician ( 1577 – 1644 ); Dr. Henry More ( 1614 – 1687 ); and lasty a nd chiefly (in regard of whom this whole Book is but the translation and exposition of his highly - prized and very scarce works), our own countryman * Robert Flood or Fludd (Robertus de Fluctibus), the famous physician and philosopher ( 1574 – 1637 ).

At the present time the value of these books has greatly increased. Fludd’s volumes, and any of the ear ly editions of Jacob Bœhmen’s books, are worth much money. Indeed they are so scarce as to be caught - up everywhere when offered — especially when encountered by foreigners and Americans."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION HIS book, which now leaves our hands, concen - trates in a small compass the results of very considerable labour, and the diligent study of very many books in languages living and dead . It purports to be a history (for the first time treated seriously in English) of the famous Order of the “Rose - Cross,” or of the “Rosicrucians.” No student of the occult philosophy need, however, fear that we shall not most carefully keep guard — standi ng sentry (so to speak) not only over this, which is, by far, the pre - eminent, but also over those other recondite systems which are connected with the illustrious Rosicrucians. An accomplished author of our own period has remarked that, “He who deals in t he secrets of magic, or in the secrets of the human mind, is too often looked upon with jealous eyes by the world, which is no great conjuror.” How is it, that, after centuries of doubt or denial, — how happens it, in face of the reason that can make nothin g of it, the common sense that rejects, and the science which can demonstrate it as impossible, — the supernatural still has such vital hold in the human — not to say the modern — mind? How happens it that the most terrible fear is the fear of the invisible? — this, too, when we are on all hands assured that the visible alone is that which we have to dread! The ordinary reason exhorts us to dismiss our t"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PREFACE x fears. That thing “magic,” that superstition “miracle,” is now banished wholly from the beliefs of this cle ar - seeing, educated age. “Miracle,” we are told, never had a place in the world — only in men’s delusions. It is nothing more than a fancy. It never was anything more than a supersti - tion arising from ignorance. What is fear? It is a shrinking from poss ible harm, either to be body, or to that thing which we denominate the mind that is in us. The body shrinks with instinctive nervous alarm, like the sensitive leaf, when its easy, com - fortable exercise or sensations are disturbed. Our book, inasmuch as it deals — or professes to deal — seriously with strange things and with deep mysteries, needs the means of interpretation in the full attention of the reader: otherwise, little will be made, or can come, of it. It is, in brief, a history of the alchemical p hilosophers, written with a serious explanatory purpose, and for the first time impartially stated since the days of James the First and Charles the First. This is really what the book pre - tends to be — and nothing more. It should be mentioned that the pe culiar views and deductions to be found herein were hinted at as demonstrable for the first time by the same Author in the year 1858 , when a work entitled Curious Things of the Outside World was produced. Let it be understood, however, that the Author dist inctly excepts against being in any manner identified with all the opinions, religious or otherwise, which are to be found in this book. Some of them are, indeed, most extraordinary; but, in order to do full justice to the speculations of the Hermetic Bre thren, he has put forward their ideas with as much of their original force as he was able; and, in some parts of this book, he believes he has urged them with such apparent warmth, that they will very likely seem to have"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PREFACE xi been his own most urgent conviction s. As far as he can succeed in being so considered, the Author wishes to be regarded simply as the Historian of the Rosicrucians, or as an Essayist on their strange, mysterious beliefs. Whether he will succeed in engaging the attention of modern readers t o a consideration of this time - honoured philsophy remains to be seen; but this he is assured of, that the admiration of all students and reflective minds will be excited by the unrivalled powers of thinking of the Rosicrucians. The application, proper or otherwise, of these powers is a matter altogether beside the present inquiry. The Author has chiefly chosen fro exposition the Latin writings of the great English Rosicrucian, Robert Flood, or Fludd (Robertus de Fluctibus), who lived in the times of James the First and Charles the First. Our final remarks shall be those of a very famous Brother of the “R.C.,” writing under the date of 1653: “I will now close up,” saith he, “with the doxology of a most excellent, renowned Philocryphus: ‘ Soli Deo Laus et Pot entia!

CRITICS OF THE ROSICRUCIANS CRITICISED. HAT modern science, spite of its assumptions and of its intolerant dogmatism, is much at fault —nay, to a great extent, a very vain thing —is a conclusion that often presents itself to the minds of thinking persions. Thus thoughtful people, who choose to separate themselves from the crowd, and who do not altogether give in with such ediyfying submission to the indoctrination of the scientific classes, —notwithstanding that these latter have the support generally of that which, by a wide term, is called the “press” in this country — quietly decline reliance on modern science. They see that there are numerous shortcomings of teachers in medicine, which fails frequently, though always with its answer, — in theology, which chooses rather that men should sleep, though not the right sleep, than consider waking —nay, in all the branches of human knowledge ; the fashion in regard to which is to disparage the ancient schools of thought by exposing what are called their errors by the light of modern assumed infallible discovery. It never once occurs to those t"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 2 eager, conceited, professors that they themselves m ay pos - sibly have learned wrongly, — that the old knowledge they decry is underrated because they do not understand it, — and that, entirely because the light of the modern world is so brilliant in them, so dark to them, as eclipsed in this novel artificial light, is the older and better and truer sunshine nearer to the ancients: because time itself was newer to the old peoples of the world, and because the circumstances of the first making of time were more under - stood in the then first divine disclosing, — gr anting that time ever had a beginning, as man’s reason itsists it must. Shelly, the poet, who, if he had not been so great as a poet, would have perhaps been equally eminent as a metaphysician, — that is, when age and experienced had ripened and corrected h is original brilliant crudities of thought, — used to declare that most men — at least, most thinking men — spend the latter half of their lives in unlearn - ing the mistakes of the previous half. This he declares to have been the fact in his own experience — whic h was, even for this test, a very brief one; for Shelley was only twenty - nine when his lamentable death occurred. The early departure of three brilliant poetic spirits of our fathers’ period, at the time time that it is very melancholy, is worthy of dee p remark. Shelley was, as we have said, twenty - nine; Byron was only thirty - six; John Keats — in some respects the most poetically intense and abstract of the three — was only twenty - four. And in these short several lifetimes, measuring so few years, these di stinguished persons had achieved that which resulted in the enrolment of their names in a nation’s catalogue in a grand branch of human attainment. They live in lasting records, they grow in honour, and their names do not fade, as is the case with those reputations which have been unduly magni - fied, but which give way to time. Perhaps the lot of some contemporaneous accepted important, not to say great, reputations will be diminution and disappearance. Time is not only an avenger, but a very judicious corrector. We are so concerned of the irresistable dominancy, all"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ERRONEOUS JUDGMENTS. 3 the world over, of opinions, and of the dicta relative to this or that merit, or this or that truth, propounded by people with names and of influence in our good, readily believing England, and of the power of supposed authority in matters of taste and literary acceptance, that we desire to warn querists against the statements about the fraternity — for it ius not a body — of the Rosicrucians appearing in all the published accounts, whether of this country or abroad. We have examined all the supposed notices and explana - tions of who the Rosicrucians were in biographical works, in encyclopædias and histories, and we find them all pre - judiced and misrepresenting, really telling no truth, and onl y displaying a deplorable amount of mischevious ignor - ance. They are, besides, in the main copied from each other — which is notably they case with the early encyclo - pædias. Old Fuller, who has some notices of Robert Flood, a famous English member of the o rder of the Rosicrucians, fully admits his ignorance of whom the brotherhood com - prised, and of their constitution or purpose. All generally received accounts, therefore, are wrong, principally for three reasons: first, through ignorance; secondly, throug h pre - judice; thirdly, as instigated by distrust, dislike and envy, — for in criticism it is a dogma that the subject must be always under the critic, never that, by a chance, the subject may be above the critic — that is, above the critic’s grasp and compreh ension. But suppose the criticised choose to except to the ability of the critic in any way to judge of him? From this obstinacy and conceit arise much underrating and false comment: as is implied in the following, which is extracted from the Encyclopædia Britannica , — which account is copied again into several other encyclopædias, and repeated into smaller works with pertinacious, with even malicious fidelity: “In fine, the Rosicrucians, and all their fanatical descen - dents, agree in proposing the most crud e and incompre - hensible notions and ideas in the most obscure, quaint and unusual expressions.” — Encyclopædia Britannica: article, “Rosicrucians.”"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 4 During the age of James the First, Charles the First, even during the Protectorate, and again in the time of Charles the Second, the singular doctrines of the Rosicru - cians attracted a large amount of attention, and excited much keen controversy. Sundry replied or “apologies” appeared on the part of the Rosicrucians. Among them was a most able work published i n Latin by Dr. Robert Flood, at Leyden, in 1616 . It is a small, closely printed, very learned octavo, entitled, Apologia Compendiara Frater - nitatis de Rosea Cruce , &c., and abounds in knowledge. It is an exceedingly rare work, but there is a copy in the British Museum. All this long period was marked by con - siderable speculation regarding these Rosicrucians. Pope’s “Rape of the Lock” is founded upon some of their fanci - ful cabalistic ideas. The Spectator contains notices of the mystic society; and, to prove the public curiouity concern - ing the Rosicrucians, and a strange incident, the particulars of which we are going to supply from the best sources now for the first time, we may state that there is included, in one number of Addison’s elegant series o f papers called the Spectator , a resumption of a notice, and some after - comment, upon the supposed discovery of a burial - place in England of one of these mighty men, the Rosicrucians. The story is to the following purport, as nearly as it can be gathered . We have written much more fully of it from other means; for the Spectator’s account is very full of errors, and was evidently gained afar off, and merely from hearsay, as it were. It is, besides, poor and ineffective, gathered from no authority, and pr oduced with no dramatic force; for the life and the beliefs of the Rosicrucians were very dramatic, at the same time that the latter were very true, although generally disbelieved.

CHAPTER THE SECOND. SINGULAR ADVENTURE IN STAFFORDSHIRE. R. PLOT, who was a very well -known and reliable man, and a painstaking antiquary and writer of natural history, in h is History of Staffordshire , published by him in the time of Charles the Second, relates the following strange story: — That a countryman was employed, at the close of a cer - tain dull summer’s day, in digging a trench in a field in a valley, round which t he country rose into sombre, silent woods, vocal only with the quaint cries of the infrequent magpies. It was some little time after the sun had sunk, and the countryman was just about giving over his labour for the day. Dr. Plot say that, in one or two of the last languid strokes of his pick, the rustic came upon something stony and hard, which struck a spark, clearly visible in the increasing gloom. At this surprise he resumed his labour, and, curiously enough, found a large, flat stone in the centre of his field. This field was far away from any of the farms or “cotes,” as they were called inthose days, with which the now almost twilight country was sparingly dotted. In a short time he cleared the stone free of the grass and weeds which had grown over it; and it proved to be a large, oblong slab, with an immense iron ring fixed at one end in d"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 6 a socket. For half an hour the countryman essays to stir this stone in vain. At last he bethought himself of some yards of rope which he had lying near among st his tools; and these he converted, being an ingenious, inquisitive, inventive man, into a tackle — by means of which, and by passing the sling round a bent tree in line with the axis of the stone, he contrived, in the last of the light, and with much expe nditure of toil, to raise it. And then, greatly to his surprise, he saw a large, deep, hollow place, buried in darkness, which, when his eyes grew accustomed a little to it, he discovered was the top - story to a stone staircase, seemingly of extraordinary depth, for he saw nothing below. The country fellow had not the slightest idea of where this could lead to; but being a man, though a rustic and a clown, of courage, and most probably urged by his idea that the staircase led to some secret repository wh ere treasure lay buried, he descended the first few steps cautiously, and tried to peer in vain down into the darkness. This seemed impenetrable; but there was some object at a vast, cold distance below. Looking up to the fresh air and seeing the star V enus — the evening star — shining suddenly like a planet, in encouraging, unexpected brilliancy, although the sky had still some beautiful placid sunset light in it, the puzzled man left the upper ground, and descended silently a fair, though a somewhat broke n, staircase. Here, at an angle, as near as he could judge, of a hundred feet under - ground, he came upopn a square landing - place, with a niche in the wall; and then he saw a further long staircase, descending at right angles to the first staircase, and st ill going down into deep, cold darkness. The man cast a glance upward, as if questioning the small amount of light from the upper world which shot down, whether he should continue his search or desist and return. All was stillest of the still about him; but he saw no reason particularly to fear. So, imagining that he would in some way soon pene - trate the mystery, and feeling in the darkness by his hands upon the wall, and by his toes to make sure firs ton each step, he resolutely descended; and he delibe rately counted"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE UNDERGROUND CHAMBER. 7 two hundred and twenty steps. He felt no difficulty in his breathing, except a certain sort of aromatic smell of distant incense, that he thought Egyptian, coming up now and then from below, as if from another, though a subterranean, world. “Possibly,” thought he, —for he had heard of them, — “the world of the mining gnomes: and I am breaking in upon their secrets, which is forbidden for man.” The rustic, though courageous, was superstitious. But, notwithstanding some fits of fear, the countr yman went on, and at a much lower angle he met a wall in his face; but, making a turn to the right, with singular credit to his nerves, the explorer went down again. And now he saw at a vast distance below, at the foot of a deeper stair - case of stone, a steady though a pale light. This was shin - ing up as if from a star, or coming from the centre of the earth. Cheered by this light, though absolutely astounded —nay, frightened —at thus discovering light, whether natural or artificial, in the deep bowels o f the earth, the man again descended, meeting a thin, humid trail of light, as it looked, mounting up the centre line of the shining though moulder - ing old stairs, which apparently had not been pressed by a foot for many ages. He thought now, although it was probably only the wind in some hidden recess, or creeping down some gallery, that he heard a murmur overhead, as if of the uncertain rumble of horses and of heavy waggons or lumbering wains. Next moment, all subsided into total stillness; but the dist ant light seemed to flicker, as if in recognition or answer to the strange sound. Half a dozen times he paused, and turned as if he would remount — almost flee for his life upward, as he thought; for this might be the secret haunt of robbers, or the dreadfu l abode of evil spirits. What if, in a few moments, he should come upon some scene to affright, or alight in the midst of desperate ruffians, or be caught by murderers! He listened eagerly. He now almost bitterly repented his descent. Still the light streamed at a distances; but still there was no sound to interpret the meaning of the light, or to display the character of this mysterious place, in which the country -"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 8 man found himself entangled hopelessly like a knight of romance in an enchanted world. The discoverer by this time stood still with fear. But at last, summoning courage, and recommending himself devoutly to God, he determined to complete his discovery. Above, he had been working in no strange place; the field he well knew, the woods were very familiar to him, and his own hamlet and his wife and family were only a few miles distant. He now hastily, andmore in fear than through courage, noisily with his feet descended the remainder of the stairs; and the light grrew brighter and brighter a s he approached, until at last, at another turn, he came upon a square chamber, built up of large hewn ancient stones. He stopped, silent and awe - struck. Here was a flagged pave - ment and a somewhat lofty roof, gathering up into a centre; in the groins of which was a rose, carved exquisitely in some dark stone or marble. But what was this poor man’s fright when, making another sudden turn, from between the jambs, and from under the large archivolt of a Gothic stone portal, light streamed out over him wi th inexpressible brilliancy, shining over everything, and lighting up the place with brilliant radiance, like an intense golden sunset! He started back. Then his limbs shook and bent under him as he gazed with terror at the figure of a man, whose face wa s hidden, as he sat in a studious attitude in a stone chair, reading in a great book, with his elbow resting on a table like a rectangular altar, in the light of a large, ancient iron lamp, suspended by a thick chain to the middle of the roof. A cry of al arm, which he could not suppress, escape from the scared discoverer, who involuntarily advanced one pace, beside himself with terror. He was now within the illumi - nated chamber. As his foot fell on the stone, the figure started bolt upright from his seat ed position, as if in awful astonishment. He erected his hooded head, and showed himself as if in anager about to question the intruder. Doubtful if what he saw were a reality, or whether he was not in some terrific dream, the countryman advanced, with - o ut being aware of what he was doing, another audacious"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"EVER-BURNING LAMPS. 9 step. The hooded man now thrust out a long arm, as if in warning; and in a moment the discoverer perceived that his hand was armed with an iron baton , and that he pointed it as if tremendously to for bid further approach. Now, however, the poor man, not being in a condition either to reasonor to restrain himself, with a cry, and in a passion of fear, took a third fatal step; and as his foot descended on the groaning stone, which seemed to give way for a moment under him, the dreadful man, or image, raised his arm high like a machine, and with his truncheon struck a prodigious blow upon the lamp, shattering it into a thousand pieces, and leaving the place in utter darkness. This was the end of this terr ifying adventrue. There was total silence now, far and near. Only a long, low roll of thunder, or a noise similar to thunder, seemed to begin from a distance, and then to move with snatches, as if making turns; and it then rumbled sullenly to sleep, as through unknown, inaccessible passages. What these were —if any passages —nobody ever found out. It was only suspected that this hidden place referred in some way to the Rosicru - cians, and that the mysterious people of that famous order had there concealed some of their scientific secrets. The place in Staffordshire became aftwards famed as the sepulchre of one of the brotherhood, whom, for want of a more distinct recognition or name, the people chose to call “Rosicrucians,” in general reference to his ord er; and from the circumstances of the lamp, and its sudden extinguishment by the figure that started up, it was supposed that some Rosicrucian had determined to inform posterity that he had penetrated to the secret of the making of the ever -burning lamps of the ancients, —though, at the moment that he dis - played his knowledge, he took effectual means that no one should reap any advantage from it. The Spectator , in No. 379 , for Thursday, May 16 th , 1710 , under the signature of “X,” which is understood to be t hat of Budgell, has the following account of that which is chosen there to be designated “Rosicrucius’s Sepelchre:” “Rosicrucius, say his disciples, made use of this method"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 10 to show the world that he had reinvented the ever - burning lamps of the ancients, th ough he was resolved no one should reap any advantage from the discovery.” We have chosen the above story as the introduction to our curious history. Christian Rosencreutz died in 1484 . To account for Rosicrucianism not having been heard of until 1604 , it has been asserted that this supposed first founder of Rosi - crucianism bound his disciples not to reveal any of his doctrines until a period of one hundred and twenty years after his death. The ancient Romans are said to have preserved lights in their sep ulchres many ages by the oiliness of gold (here steps in the art of the Rosicrucians), resolved by hermetic methods into a liquid substance; and it is reported that at the dissolution of monastaries, in the time of Henry the Eighth, there was a lamp found that had then burnt in a tomb from about three hundred years after Christ — nearly twelve hundred years. Two of these subterranean lamps are to be seen in the Museum of Rarities at Leyden, in Holland. One of these lamps, in the Papacy of Paul the Third, w as found in the Tomb of Tullia, Cicero’s daughter, which had been shut up fifteen hundred and fifty years (Second edition of N. Bailey’s FilÒlogoj , 1731 ). N OTES . In the Papacy of Paul the Third, in the Appian Way, where abun - dance of the chief heathens of old were laid, a sepulchre was opened, where was found the entire body of a fair virgin swimming in a won - derful juice, which kept it from putrefaction so well, that the face seemed no way impaired, but lively and very beautiful. Her hair was yellow, tied up artifically, and kept together with a golden circlet or band. Under her feet burnt lamps, the light of which was extinguished at the opening of the sepulchre. By some inscriptions found about the tomb it appeared that she must have lain there fifteen hundred years. Who she was was never known, although many concluded her to be Tulliola, the daughter of Cicero. This discovery has been reported from various hands. Cedrenus makes mention of a lamp, which, together with an image of Christ, was found at Edessa in the reign of Justinian the Emperor."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"NOTES. 11 It was set over a certain gate there, and elaborately enclosed and shut out from the air. This lamp, as appeared from the date attached to it, was lighted soon after Christ was crucified. It was found burn ing — as in fact it had done for five hundred years —by the soldiers of Cosroes, king of Persia; by whom, at this strange discovery and plunder, the oil was taken out and cast into the fire. As it is reported, this wild act occasioned such a plague as broug ht death upon numbers of the forces of Cosroes, sufficiently punished for their sacreligious mischief. At the demolition of our monastaries here in England, there was found in the monument which was supposed to be that of Constantius Chlorus, father to the great Constantine, a burning lamp, which was thought to have continued burning there ever since his burial, which was about three hundred years after Christ. The ancient Romans are said to have been able to maintain lights in their sepulchres for an inde finite time, by an essence or oil obtained from liquid gold; which was an achievement assumed to have been only known to the Rosi - crucians, who boasted this among some of their other stupendous arts. Baptista Porta, in his treatise on Natural Magic, relate s that about the year 1550 , in the island of Nesis, in the Bay of Naples, a marble sepulchre of a certain Roman was discovered; upon the opening of which a burning lamp, affording a powerful illumination, was dis - covered. The light of this lamp plaed on the admission of the air, and it was speedily extinguished. It appeared from undoubted tokens in the mode of inscription that this wonderful lamp had been placed in its present receptable before the advent of the Saviour. Those who saw the lamp declar ed that the effulgence was of the most dazzling character; that the light did not flicker or change, but burnt marvel - lously steadily. A most celebrated lamp, called that of Pallas, the son of Evander, who, as Virgil relates, was killed by Turnus (the acco unt will be found in the tenth book of Virgil’s Æneid), is that reported as discovered not far from Rome, as far forward in time as the year 1401 . It is related that a countryman was digging in the neighbourhood, and that delving deeper than usual, he ca me upon a stone sepulchre, wherein there was discovered the body of a man of extraordinary size, as perfect and natural as if recently interred. Above the head of the deceased there was found a lamp, burning with the supposed fabulous perpetual fire. Nei ther wind or water, nor any other superinduced means, could extinguish it; but the flame was mastered eventually by the lamp being bored at bottom and broken by the astonished investigators of this con - summate light. The man enclosed in this monument had a large wound in the beast. That this was the body of Pallas was evident from the inscription on the tomb, which was as follows: “ Pallas, Evander’s son, whom Turnus’ spear In battle slew, of mighty bulk, lies here.”"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 12 A very remarkable lamp was di scovered about the year 1500 near Ateste, a town belonging to Padua, in Italty, by a rustic who in his explorations in a field came upon an urn containing another urn, in which last was deposited one of these much - doubted miraculous lamps. The ailment of this strange lamp appeared to be a very exquisite crystal liquor, by the ever - during powers of which the lamp must have con - tinued to shine for upwards of fifteen hundred years. And unless this lamp had been so suddenly exposed to the action of the air, i t is supposed that it might have continued to burn for any time. This lamp, endowed with such unbelievable powers, was discovered to be the workmanship of an unknown contriver named Maximus Olibius, who must have possessed the profoundest skill in chemic al art. On the greater urn some lines were inscribed in Latin, recording the perpetua - tion of this wonderful secret of the preparation and the starting of these (almost) immortal flames. St. Austin mentions a lamp that was found in a temple dedicated to V enus, which, notwithstanding that it was exposed to the open weather, could never be consumed or extinguished. Ludovicus Vives, his commentator, in a supplementary mention of ever - burning lamps, cites an instance of another similar lamp which was discovred a little before his time, and which was considered to have been burning for a thousand and fifty years. It is supposed that the perpetuity of the flame of these wonderful lamps was owing to the consummate tenacity of the unctuous matter with which the lig ht was maintained; and that the balance was so exquisitely perfect between the feeding material and the strength of the flame, and so proportioned for everlasting provision and ex - penditure, that, like the radical moisture and natural heat in animals, nei ther of them could ever unduly prevail. Licetus, who has advanced this opinion, observes that in order ot effectually prevent interference with this balance, the ancients hid these lamps in caverns or in enclosed monuments. Hence it happened that on open ing these tombs and secret places, the admission of fresh air to the lamps destroyed the fine equilibrium and stopped the life (as it were) of the lamp, simi - larly as a blow or shock stops a watch, in jarring the matchless mechanism.

T is a constant and very plausible charge offered by the general world against the possession of the power of gold -making as claimed by the alche - mists, who were the practical branch o f the Rosi - crucians, that if such supposed power were in their hands, they would infallibly use it, and that quickly enough; for the acquisition of riches and power, say they, is the desire of all men. But this idea proceeds from an ignorance of the char acter and inclinations of real philosophers, and results from an inveterate prejudice relative to them. Be - fore we judge of these, let us acquire a knowledge of the natural inclinations of very deeply learned men. Philoso - phers, when they have attaine d to much knowledge, which wearies them of merely mundane matters, hold that the ordering of men, the following of them about by subservient people, and the continual glitter about them of the fine things of this world, are, after all, but of mean and mela n- choly account, because life is so brief, and this accidental pre -eminence is very transitory. Splendour, show, and bowing little delight the raised and abstract mind. That circuit of comfort formed by the owning of money and riches is circumscribe d by the possessor’s own ken.

A man’s troubles are increased by the multiplication even of his enjoyments, because he is then beset with anxiety as to their repetition or maintenance. Reduction of things to attend to, and not multiplication, is his policy, because thinking of it is all that can affect him about anything in this world. B y the time that the deep, philosophical chemist has penetrated to the control and conversion of the ultimate elements, so as to have in his view the secret operations of Nature, and to have caught Nature, as it were, preparing her presentments and arrangi ng her disguises behind the scenes, he is no more to be amused with vain book - physics. After his spying into the subtle processes of Nature, he cannot be contented with the ordinary toys of men; for are not worldly possessions, honour, rank, money, even wi ves and numerous or any children, but toys in a certain sense? Where sink they in importance to him when the great un - known sets in which awaits every man? He who can work as Nature works — causing the sunshine, so to speak, to light fire up independently in itself, and to breed and propagate precious things upon the atmosphere in which it bums — causing the growing supernatural soul to work amidst the seeds of gold, and to purge the material, devilish mass until the excrement is expelled, and it springs in health into con - densating, solid splendour, a produce again to be sown, to fructify into fresh harvests — the alchemist, or prince of chemists, who can do this, laughs at the hoards of kings. By the time that the artist is thus so much more than man, is h e the less desirous of the gratifying things to the ordi - nary man. Grandeur fades to him before such high intel - lectual grandeur. He is nearer to the angels, and the world has sunk infinitely below. His is the sky, and the bright"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"QUESTIONS AS TO UTILITIES. 15 shapes of the clouds of the sky; which he is going to con - vert, perhaps, into prisms, showering solid triumphs. He can well leave to common man his acres of mud, and the turbid pools spotted over them like the shining, showy discs of a snake. Man, under these enlightened philo sophical circum - stances, will only value the unseen kingdoms —glimpses of the immortal glories of which and of their Rosicrucian inhabitants he has obtained in his magic reveries. What can the longest ordinary man's life give to such a gifted thinker? M an’s senses and their gratification, as long as the inlets and avenues of perception remain —world’s music, so long as the strings cling tight, for the air of imagination to play upon them —appetites, with downward eyes to find their satisfaction —man’s mort ality, with an exit into the shadows or into the grave while the sun is up : the longest life can but give him repetition to satiety of these things, — repetitions until he seems almost to tire of the common sun. Of which he grows weary, as well as of his wa ste or extent of knowledge. To some minds, this world does not present such extra - ordinary attractions. The very possession of the heights of knowledge induces rather stay up there, amidst the stars, than descent. Every man almost has felt the sublime exa l- tation of a great height, when he has achieved the top of a high hill, and looks out and over the landscape for miles and miles. How very little the world looks under him! He is obliged to descend, because he has his home under there. But he quits t he upper regions with reluctance, although it is somewhat frightening (as though he were going to be flown away with) to stay so high up. You become giddy by looking up at the stars, which then seem to be so much nearer as to be attainable. Limited as it is, life itself —very brief, very empty, very much disposed to repeat dull things, gathering up from about you in a strange sensation sometimes, in folds like a dream, or flowing on like a sleep -inducing river to the sea, carrying faces seen and snatched aw ay, and obliterating voices which change into echoes —life, at its very best,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 16 ought to be the stoicism of the spectator, who feels that he has come here somehow, though for what purpose he knows not; and he is rather amused as at a comedy in life, than enga ged in it as in a business. Even perpetual youth, and life prolonged, with pleasures infinite, — even the fancied ever - during life, — would, to the deeply thinking man who had risen, as it were, over life, and to that strangely gifted being who has in himself the power of self - perpetuation (like the Wandering Jew), seem vain. Man can be con - ceived as tiring of the sun — tiring of consciousness even. What an expression is that, “forgotten by Death!” The only being through whom the scythe of the great destroye r passes scatheless! That life, as a phantom, which is the only conceivable terrible doom of the “Wanderer” (if such a magical being ever existed); whom as a locomotive sym - bol, to be perpetuated through the ages, the earth, at the command of the Saviour, refused to hide, and of whom alegend — soon hushed in again — now and then rises to the popular whisper and to the popular distrust! We only adduce these remarks to show that, in the face of the spectator of the great ultimate, mysterious man, chil - dren are n o necessity, but an anxiety, estates are a burden, “business” is the oft - told purposeless tale to the wearying ear. He who can be the spectator of the ages has no particulars in ordinary life. He has nothing which can interest him. He can have no precise and consolidated likings or affections or admirations, or even aversions, because the world is as a toy - shop to him — its small mecha - nism is an artificial show, of which (given the knowledge of the wheels) he can predicate as to the movements safely — compl etely. To return for a moment to the idea of the “Wandering Jew,” which some have supposed to be derived from the claim of the Rosicrucians to the possession of a secret means of renewing youth, and to the escape of some notion of it from out their writing s. Even supposing that this strange tale was true, nothing can be imagined more melan - choly than the state of this lone traveller, moving with his"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE WANDERING JEW. 17 awful secret through the world, and seeing the successive generations, like leaves, perishing from about him. He counts the years like the traveller of a long summer day, to whom the evening will never come, though he sees his temporary companions, at the different hours of the day, depart appropriately and disappearing to their several homes by the wayside. T o him the childhood of his com - panions seems to turn to old age in an hour. He remem - bers the far -off ancestors of his contemporaries. Fashions fleet, but your unsuspected youth is accommodated to all. Yours is, indeed, the persecution of the day -life, which will not let you fall to sleep and cease to see the vanity of everything. Your friends of any period disappear. The assurance of the emptiness of all things is the stone as into which your heart is turned. Gray hairs (and the old face) have nothing with you, though you see them appearing upon all others. Familiar objects disappear from about you, and you and the sun seem the only things that survive as old friends. Indeed, it may be doubtful whether, to this supposed man of the ages, the generati ons would not seem to be produced as a purposeless efflux out of the ground by the sun, like flowers or plants; so as mere matter of mould would all flesh appear, with a phenomenon only going with it in the article of the figure’s uprightness as man; it ha ving so strangely set its face against the stars, unlike the creatures doomed to move horizontally. We make these observations to show that, notwithstand - ing the opinions of the world to the contrary, there may have been men who have possessed these gifts ,—that is, the power of making gold and of perpetuating their lives, —and yet that the exercise of these powers was forborne; and also that their secrets of production have most carefully been kept, lest less wise men should (to speak in figure) have “rush ed in where they feared to tread,” and have abused where the philosophers even would not use —de- spising wealth, which they could not enjoy, and declining a perpetuated life, which would only add to their weariness, —life being only a repetition of the sam e suns, already"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 18 found too unmeaning and too long. For it is a mistake to suppose that this life is so equally enjoyable by all. There is a sublime sorrow of the ages, as of the lone ocean. There is the languishment for the ever - lost original home in this tearful mortal state. The philosophers knew that possession blunted desire, and that rich men may be poor men. A remarkable answer was made by a man who, to all appearance, possessed super - abundantly the advantages of life — wealth, honour, wife, children , “troops of friends,” even health, by day; but in his night he lived another life, for in it was presented another picture, and that unfailingly uncomfortable, even to this good man — exchanging joy for horror. “My friend,” replied he to an inquirer, “nev er congratulate a man upon his happiness until you become aware how he sleeps. Dreams are as that baleful country into which I pass every night of my life ; and what can be said to a man who dreams constantly (and believes it) that he is with the devil ?” There was no answering this, for every person leads two lives, altogether independent of each other, — the days and the nights both full of life, though the night, with the dreams, may be of an opposite order. The world’s circum - stances may afford you solac e and gratification — even hap - piness — in the day; but you may be very miserable, not - withstanding, if it happen that you have persecution in your dreams. Here the world’s advantages are of no use to you, for you are delivered over helpless, night after nigh t, in your sleep — and you must have sleep — to the dominion of Other Powers, whom all your guards cannot keep out, for their inlet is quite of another kind than the ordinary life’s access. We advise you, then, to beware of this dark door; the other will perh aps take care of itself, letting in no ugly things upon you: but the former may let in unpleasant - things upon you in full grasp with your hands bound.

HERE was among the sages a wr iter, Artephius, whose productions are very famous among the Hermetic Philosophers, —insomuch that the noble Olaus Borrichius, an excellent writer and a most candid critic, recommends these books to the attentive perusal of those who would acquire kno wledge of this sub - lime highest philosophy. He is said to have invented a caba - listic magnet which possessed the extraordinary property of secretly attracting the aura , or mysterious spirit of human efflorescence and prosperous bodily growth, out of young men; and these benign and healthful springs of life he gathered up, and applied by his magic art to himself, —by inspiration, transudation, or otherwise, —so that he con - centred in his own body, waning in age, the accumulated rejuvenescence of many young pe ople: the individual owners of which new fresh life suffered and were consumed in proportion to the extent in which he preyed vitally upon them, and some of them were exhausted by this enchanter, and died. This was because their fresh young vitality had been unconsciously drawn out of them in his baneful, de - vouring society, which was unsuspected because it afforded a glamour delightful. Now this seems absurd; but it is not so absurd as we suppose when considered sympatheti - cally. t"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 20 Sacred history affords considerable authority to this kind of opinion. We all are acquainted with the history of King David, to whom, when' he grew old and stricken in years, Abishag, the Shunammite, was brought to recover him — a damsel described as “very fair;” and we are told t hat she “lay in his bosom,” and that thereby he “gat heat,” — which means vital heat, — but that the king “knew her not.” This latter clause in i Kings, i. 4, all the larger critics, including those who speak in the commentaries of Munster, Grotius, Vossius, and others, interpret in the same way. The serag - lios of the Mohammedans have more of this less lustful meaning, probably, than is commonly supposed. The ancient physicians appear to have been thoroughly ac - quainted with the advantages of the companionshi p, without irregular indulgence, of the young to the old in the renewal of their vital powers. The elixir of life was also prepared by other and less criminal means than those singular ones hinted above. It was produced out of the secret chemical laborator ies of Nature by some adepts. The famous chemist, Robert Boyle, mentions a preparation in his works, of which Dr. Le Fevre gave him an account in the presence of a famous physician and of another learned man. An intimate friend of the physician, as Boyle relates, had given, out of curiosity, a small quantity of this medicated wine or preparation to an old female domestic; and this, being agreeable to the taste, had been partaken of for ten or twelve days by the woman, who was near seventy years of age, bu t whom the doctor did not inform what the liquor was, nor what advantage he was expecting that it might effect. A great change did indeed occur with this old woman; for she acquired much greater activity, a sort of youthful bloom came to her countenance, h er face was becoming much more smooth and agreeable; and beyond this, as a still more decided step backward to her youthful period, certain purgationes came upon her again with sufficiently severe indications to frighten her very much as to their meaning ; so that the doctor, greatly sur - prised at his success, was compelled to forego his further"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"OCCULT MEDICAMENTS. 21 experiments, and to suppress all mention of this miraculous new cordial, for fear of alarming people with incomprehen - sible novelties —in regard to which they are very tenacious, having prejudices inveterate. But, with respect to centenarians, some persons have been mentioned as having survived for hundreds of years, moving as occasion demanded from country to country; when the time arrived that, in the natural cou rse of things, they should die, or be expected to die, merely changing their names, and reappearing in another place as new per - sons, —they having long survived all who knew them, and thus being safe from the risk of discovery. The Rosicru - cians always mos t jealously guarded these secrets, speaking in enigmas and parables for the most part; and they adopted as their motto the advice of one of their number, one of the Gnostics of the early Christian period : “Learn to know all, but keep thyself unknown.” F urther, it is not generally known that the true Rosicrucians bound themselves to obligations of comparative poverty but absolute chastity in the world, with certain dispensations and remissions that fully answered their purpose; for they were not necessari ly solitary people: on the contrary, they were frequently gre - garious, and mixed freely with all classes, though privately admitting no law but their own. Their notions of poverty, or comparative poverty, were different from those that usually prevail. The y felt that neither monarchs nor the wealth of monarchs could endow or aggrandjse those who already esteemed themselves the superiors of all men; and therefore, though declining riches, they were voluntary in the renunciation of them. They held to chasti ty, because, entertaining some very peculiar notions about the real position in creation of the female sex, the Enlightened or Illuminated Brothers held the monastic or celibate state to be infinitely that more consonant with the intentions of Providence, since in everything possible to man’s frail nature they sought to trample on the pollutions and the great degradation of this his state in flesh.

We wish not to discuss more particularly than thus the extremely refined and abstruse protesting views of these fa ntastic religionists, who ignored Nature. We have drawn to ourselves a certain frontier of reticence, up to which margin we may freely comment; and the limit is quite extended enough for the present popular purpose, — though we absolutely refuse to overpass it with too distinct explana - tion, or to enlarge further on the strange persuasions of the Rosicrucians. There is related, upon excellent authority, to have hap - pened an extraordinary incident at Venice, that made a very great stir among the talkers in that ancient place, and which we will here supply at length, as due to so mysterious and amusing an episode. Every one who has visited Venice in these days, and still more those of the old - fashioned time who have put their experience of it on record, a re aware that freedom and ease among persons who make a good appearance prevail there to an extent that, in this reserved and suspicious country, is difficult to realise. This doubt of respectability until conviction dis - arms has a certain constrained and unamiable effect on our English manners, though it occasionally secures us from imposition, at the expense perhaps of our accessibility. A stranger who arrived in Venice one summer, towards the end of the seventeenth century, and who took up his residen ce in one of the best sections of the city, by the considerable figure which he made, and through his own manners, which were polished, composed, and elegant, was admitted into the best company, — this though he came with no introductions, nor did anybody ex actly know who or what he was. His figure was exceedingly elegant and well proportioned, his face oval and long, his forehead ample and pale, and the intellectual faculties were surprisingly brought out, and in distinguished prominence. His hair was long , dark, and flowing; his smile inexpressibly fascinating, yet"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE STRANGER AT VENICE. 23 sad; and the deep light of his eyes seemed laden, to the attention sometimes of those noting him, with the senti - ments and experience of all the historic periods. But his conversation, when he chose to converse, and his attain - ments and knowledge, were marvellous; though he seemed always striving to keep himself back, and to avoid saying too much, yet not with an ostentatious reticence. He went by the name of Signor Gualdi, and was looked upo n as a plain private gentleman, of moderate independent estate. He was an interesting character; in short, one to make an observer speculate concerning him. This gentleman remained at Venice for some months, and was known by the name of the “Sober Signor ” among the common people, on account of the regularity of his life, the composed simplicity of his manners, and the quiet - ness of his costume; for he always wore dark clothes, and these of a plain, unpretending style. Three things were remarked of him during his stay at Venice. The first was, that he had a small collection of fine pictures, which he readily showed to everybody that desired it; the next, that he seemed perfectly versed in all arts and sciences, and spoke always with such minute correct ness as to par - ticulars as astonished —nay, silenced —all who heard him, because he seemed to have been present at the occurrences which he related, making the most unexpected correction in small facts sometimes. And it was, in the third place, observed t hat he never wrote or received any letter, never desired any credit, but always paid for everything in ready money, and made no use of bankers, bills of exchange, or letters of credit. However, he always seemed to have enough, and he lived respectably, tho ugh with no attempt at splendour or show. Signor Gualdi met, shortly after his arrival at Venice, one day, at the coffee -house which he was in the habit of frequenting, a Venetian nobleman of sociable manners, who was very fond of art; and this pair used to engage in sundry discussions} and they had many conversations concerning the various objects and pursuits which were"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 24 interesting to both of them. Acquaintance ripened into friendly esteem; and the nobleman invited Signor Gualdi to his private house, whereat — for he was a widower — Signor Gualdi first met the nobleman’s daughter, a very beautiful young maiden of eighteen, of much grace and intelligence, and of great accomplishments. The nobleman’s daughter was just introduced at her father’s house from a convent, or pension, where she had been educated by the nuns. This young lady, in short, from constantly being in his society, and listening to his interesting narratives, gradually fell in love with the mysterious stranger, much for the reasons of Desd emona; though Signor Gualdi was no swarthy Moor, but only a well - educated gentleman — a thinker rather than the desirer to be a doer. At times, indeed, his countenance seemed to grow splendid and magical in expression; and he boasted certainly wondrous dis course; and a strange and Weird fascination would grow up about him, as it were, when, he became more than usually pleased, communicative, and animated. Altogether, when you were set thinking about him, he seemed a puzzling person, and of rare gifts; tho ugh when mixing only with the crowd you would scarcely distinguish him from the crowd; nor would you observe him, unless there was something romantically akin to him in you excited by his talk. And now for a few remarks on the imputed character of these Ro sicrucians. And in regard to them, however their existence is disbelieved, the matters of fact we meet with, sprinkled — but very sparingly — in the history of these her - metic people, are so astonishing, and at the same time are preferred with such confiden ce, that if we disbelieve, — which it is impossible to avoid, and that from the pre - posterous and unearthly nature of their pretensions, — we cannot escape the conviction that, if there is not founda - tion for it, their impudence and egotism is most audacious . They speak of all mankind as infinitely beneath them; their pride is beyond idea, although they are most humble and quiet in exterior. They glory in poverty, and declare that it is the state ordered for them; and this though they boast"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE “ ILLUMINATED. ” 25 universal riches . They decline all human affections, or submit to them as advisable escapes only —appearance of loving obligations, which are assumed for convenient accept - ance, or for passing in a world which is composed of them, or of their supposal. They mingle most gr acefully in the society of women, with hearts wholly incapable of softness in this direction; while they criticise them with pity or contempt in their own minds as altogether another order of beings from men. They are most simple and deferential in their exterior; and yet the self -value which fills their hearts ceases its self -glorying expansion only with the boundless skies. Up to a certain point, they are the sincerest people in the world; but rock is soft to their im - penetrability afterwards. In comp arison with the hermetic adepts, monarchs are poor, and their greatest accumulations are contemptible. By the side of the sages, the most learned are mere dolts and blockheads. They make no movement towards fame, because they abnegate and disdain it. If they become famous, it is in spite of themselves: they seek no honours, because there can be no gratification in honours to such people. Their greatest wish is to steal unnoticed and unchallenged through the world, and to amuse themselves with the world b ecause they are in it, and because they find it about them. Thus, towards mankind they are negative; towards everything else, positive; self - contained, self -illuminated, self -everything; but always pre - pared (nay, enjoined) to do good, wherever possible or safe. To this immeasurable exaltation of themselves, what standard of measure, or what appreciation, can you apply? Ordinary estimates fail in the idea of it. Either the state of these occult philosophers is the height of sublimity, or it is the hei ght of absurdity. Not being competent to under - stand them or their claims, the world insists that these are futile. The result entirely depends upon there being fact or fancy in the ideas of the hermetic philosophers.

UT to return to Signor Gualdi, from whom we have notwithstanding made no impertinent di - gression, since he was eventually suspected to be one of the strange people, or Rosicrucian s, or Ever -livers of whom we are treating. This was from mysterious circumstances which occurred afterwards in rela - tion to him, and which are in print. The Venetian nobleman was now on a footing of suffi - cient intimacy with Signor Gualdi to say to him on e evening, at his own house, that he understood that he had a fine collection of pictures, and that, if agreeable, he would pay him a visit some day for the purpose of viewing them. The nobleman's daughter, who was present, and who was pen - sively looking down upon the table, more than half in love with the stranger as she had become, thinking deeply of something that the Signior had just said, raised her eyes eagerly at this expression of wish by her father, and, as accorded with her feelings, she appeare d, though she spoke not, to be greatly desirous to make one of the party to see the pictures. It was natural that she should secretly rejoice at this opportunity of becoming more intimately acquainted with the domestic life of one whom she had grown to reg ard with feelings of such powerful interest. She felt that the b"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 28 mere fact of being his guest, and under the roof which was his, would seem to bring her nearer to him; and, as common with lovers, it appeared to her that their being thus together would, in fe eling at least, appear to identify both. Signor Gualdi was very polite, and readily invited the nobleman to his house, and also extended the invitation to the young lady, should she feel disposed to accompany her father, since he divined from the express ion of her face that she was wishful to that effect. The day for the visit was then named, and the Signior took his departure with the expres - sions of friendship on all sides which usually ended their pleasant meetings. It followed from this arrangement, that on the day ap - pointed the father and daughter went to Signor Gualdi’s house. They were received by the Signior with warm kind - ness, and were shown over his rooms with every mark of friendliness and distinction. The nobleman viewed Signor Gualdi’s pictures with great attention; and when he had completed his tour of the gallery, he expressed his satis - faction by telling the Signior that he had never seen a finer collection, considering the number of pieces. They were now in Signor Gualdi’s own cha mber, — the last of his set of rooms, — and they were just on the point of turning to go out sand bidding adieu, and Gualdi was courteously remov - ing the tapestry from before the door to widen the egress, when the nobleman, who had paused to allow him thus to clear the way, by chance cast his eyes upwards over the door, where there hung a picture with the curtain acci - dentally left undrawn, evidently of the stranger himself. The Venetian looked upon it with doubt, and after a while his face fell; but it soon cleared, as if with relief. The gaze of the daughter was also now riveted upon the picture, which was very like Gualdi; but she regarded it with a look of tenderness and a blush. The Venetian looked from the picture to Gualdi, and back again from Gualdi to the picture. It was some time before he spoke; and when he did, his voice sounded strangely. “That picture was intended for you, sir,” said he at last,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE MYSTERIOUS PORTRAIT. 29 hesitating, to Signor Gualdi. A slight cold change passed over the eyes of the stranger; but he only made reply by a low bow. “You look a moderately young man, —to be candid with you, sir, I should say about forty -five or there - abouts; and yet I know, by certain means of which I will not now further speak, that this picture is by the hand of Titian, who has been dead nearly a couple of hundred years. How is this possible?” he added, with a polite, grave smile. “It is not easy,\" said Signor Gualdi quietly,” to know all things that are possible or not possible, for very frequently mistakes are made concern ing such; but there is certainly nothing strange in my being like a portrait painted by Titian.” The nobleman easily perceived by his manner, and by a momentary cloud upon his brow, that the stranger felt offence. The daughter clung to her father's arm, secretly afraid that this little unexpected demur might pass into cool - ness, and end with a consummation of estrangement, which she feared excessively; she dreaded nervously the rupture of their intimacy with the stranger; and, contradictory as it may se em, she wanted to withdraw, even without the demur she dreaded being cleared up into renewed pleasant confidence. However, this little temporary misunderstand - ing was soon put an end to by Signor Gualdi himself, who in a moment or two resumed his ordinar y manner; and he saw the father and daughter down -stairs, and forth to the entrance of his house, with his usual composed politeness, —though the nobleman could not help some feeling of restraint, and his daughter experienced a considerable amount of mor - tification; and she could not look at Signor Gualdi, —or rather, when she did, she dwelt on his face too much. This little occurrence remained as a puzzle in the mind of the nobleman. His daughter felt lonely and dissatisfied afterwards, eager for the resto ration of the same friendly feeling with Signor Gualdi, and revolving in her mind, with the ingenuity of love, numberless schemes to achieve it. The Venetian betook himself in the evening to the usual coffee -house; and he could not forbear speaking of the incident among the group of people collected there. Their"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 30 curiosity was roused, and one or two resolved to satisfy themselves by looking at the picture attentively the next morning. But to obtain an opportunity to see the picture on this next morning, i t was necessary to see the Signor Gualdi somewhere, and to have the invitation of so reserved a man to his lodgings for the purpose. The only likely place to meet with him was at the coffee - house; and thither the gentlemen went at the usual time, hoping, as it was the Signior's habit to present himself, that he would do so. But he did not come, — nor had he been heard of from the time of the visit of the nobleman the day before to the Signior’s house, — which absence, for the first time almost that he had be en in Venice, surprised everybody. But as they did not meet with him at the coffee - house, — as they thought was sure, one of the persons who had the oftenest conversed with the Signior, and therefore was the freer in his acquaintance, undertook to go to his lodgings and inquire after him, which he did; but he was answered by the owner of the house, who came to the street - door to respond to the questioner, that the Signior had gone, having quitted Venice that morning early, and that he had locked up his pictu res with certain orders, and had taken the key of his rooms with him. This affair made a great noise at the time in Venice; and an account of it found its way into most of the news - papers of the year in which it occurred. In these news - papers and elsewh ere, an outline of the foregoing particulars may be seen. The account of the Signor Gualdi will also be met with in Les Memoires Historiques for the year 1687 , tome i. p. 365 .

THE HERMETIC BRETHREN. HE following passages occur in a letter published by some anonymous members of the R.C., and are adduced in a translation from the Latin by one of the most famous men of the order, who addressed from the University of Oxford about the period of Oliver Cromwell; to which university the great English Rosicrucian, Robertus de Fluctibus (Robert Flood), also belonged, in the time of James the First and Charles the First. We have made repeated visits to the church where Robert Flood lies buried. him, and which are in print. “Every man naturally desires superiority. Men wish for treasures and to seem great in the eyes of the world. God, indeed , created all things to the end that man might give Him thanks. But there is no individual thinks of his proper duties ; he secretly desires to spend his days idly, and would enjoy riches and pleasures without any previous labour or danger. When we” (pr ofessors of abstruse sciences) “speak, men either revile or contemn, they either envy or laugh.

Shall it be to the end that men may live pompously in the eyes of the world; swagger and make wars; be violent when they are contradicted; turn usurers, gluttons, and drunkards; abandon themselves to lust? Now, all these things deface and defile man, and the holy temple of man's body, and are plainly ag ainst the ordinances of God. For this dream of the world, as also the body or vehicle through which it is made manifest, the Lord intended to be pure. And it was not purposed, in the divine arrangement, that men should grow again down to the earth. It i s for other purposes that the stars, in their attraction, have raised man on his feet, instead of abandoning him to the “all -fours” that were the imperfect tentatives of nature until life, through the super - natural impulse, rose above its original condemne d level — base and relegate. “We of the secret knowledge do wrap ourselves in mystery, to avoid the objurgation and importunity or violence of those who conceive that we cannot be philoso - phers unless we put our knowledge to some ordinary worldly use. There is scarcely one who thinks about us who does not believe that our society has no existence; because, as he truly declares, he never met any of us. And he con - cludes that there is no such brotherhood because, in his vanity, we seek not him to be our fello w. We do not come, as he assuredly expects, to that conspicuous stage upon which, like himself, as he desires the gaze of the vulgar, every fool may enter: winning wonder, if the.man's appetite be that empty way; and, when he has obtained it, crying out, ‘Lo, this is also vanity!’ ” Dr. Edmund Dickenson, physician to King Charles the Second, a professed seeker of the hermetic knowledge, pro - duced a book entitled, De Quinta Essentia Philosophorum , which was printed at Oxford in 1686 , and a second time in 1705 . There was a third edition of it printed in Germany in 1721 . In correspondence with a French adept, the latter explains the reasons why the Brothers of the Rosy Cross concealed themselves. As to the universal medicine,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 34 Elixir Vitce, or potable form of the preternatural menstruum, he positively asserts that it is in the hands of the “Illumi - nated,” but that, by the time they discover it, they have ceased to desire its uses, being far above them ; and as to life for centuries, being wishful for other things, they decline availing themselves of it. He adds, that the adepts are obliged to conceal themselves for the sake of safety, because they would be abandoned in the consolations of the inter - course of this world (if they were not, indeed, exposed t o worse risks), supposing that their gifts were proven to the conviction of the bystanders as more than human; when they would become simply intolerable and abhorrent. Thus, there are excellent reasons for their conduct; they proceed with the utmost cauti on, and instead of making a display of their powers, as vain - glory is the least distinguishing charac - teristic of these great men, they studiously evade the idea that they possess any extraordinary or separate knowledge. They live simply as mere spectato rs in the world, and they desire to make no disciples, converts, nor confidants. They submit to the obligations of life, and to relationships — enjoying the fellowship of none, admiring none, following none, but themselves. They obey all codes, are excell ent citizens, and only preserve silence in regard to their own private convictions, giving the world the benefit of their acquirements up to a certain point; seeking only sympathy at some angles of their multiform character, but shutting out curiosity whol ly where they do not wish its imperative eyes. This is the reason that the Rosicrucians passed through the world mostly unnoticed, and that people generally dis - believe that there ever were such persons; or believe that, if there were, their pretensions are an imposition. It is easy to discredit things which we do not understand — in fact, nature compels us to reject all propositions which do not consist with our reason. The true artist is supposed to avoid all suspicion, even on the part of those neares t to him. And granting the possibility of the Rosicrucian means of the renewal of life, and supposing also that it was the desire of the hermetic philosopher, it would not be difficult for"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THOMAS VAUGHAN. 35 him so to order his arrangements as that he should seem to die in o ne place (to keep up the character of the natural manner of his life), by withdrawing, himself, to reappear in another place as a new person at the time that seemed most convenient to him for the purpose. For everything, and every difficult thing, is easy “to those with money; nor will the world inquire with too resolute a curiosity, if you have coolness and address, and if you have the art of accounting for things. The man of this order also is solus, and without wife or children to embarrass him in the private disposition of his affairs, or to follow him too closely into his by -corners. Thus it will be seen that philosophers may live in the world, and have all these gifts, and yet be never heard of —or, if heard of, only as they themselves wish or sugges t. As an instance of the unexpected risks which a member of this order may run if he turns his attention to the prac - tical side of his studies, spite of all his precautions, we may cite the accident which happened to a famous Englishman, who disguised hims elf under the name of Eugenius Phila - lethes, but whose real name is said to be Thomas Vaughan. He tells us of himself, that going to a goldsmith to sell twelve hundred marks’ worth of gold, the man told him, at first sight, that it never came out of the mines, but was the production of art, as it was not of the standard of any known kingdom : which proved so sudden a dilemma to the offerer of the gold, that he withdrew immediately, leaving it behind him. It naturally follows from this, that it is not only necessary to have gold, but that the gold shall be market - able or acceptable gold, as otherwise it is utterly useless for the purposes of conversion into money in this world. Thomas Vaughan, who was a scholar of Oxford, and was vehemently attacked in h is lifetime, and who certainly was a Rosicrucian adept if there ever was one, led a wandering life, and fell often into great perplexities and dangers from the mere suspicion that he possessed extraordinary secrets. He was born, as we learn from his writi ngs, about the year 1612 , which makes him a contemporary of the great English Rosicrucian, Robert Flood; and what is the strangest part."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 36 of his history, as we find remarked by a writer in 1749 , is, that he is “believed by those of his fraternity” — so the au thor adds — “to be living even now; and a person of great credit at Nuremberg, in Germany, affirms that he conversed with him but a year or two ago. Nay, it is further asserted,” continues the author, “that this very individual is the presi - dent of the Illu minated in Europe, and that he sits as such in all their annual meetings.” Thomas Vaughan, according to the report of the philosopher Robert Boyle, and of others who knew him, was a man of remarkable piety, and of unstained morals. He has written and e dited several invaluable works upon the secrets of the philosophers, some of which are in our possession; among others: Introitus apertus ad occlusum Regis Palatium; Lumen de Lumine; Magia Adamica; Anima Magica Abscondita; and other learned books; advancin g very peculiar theories concerning the seen and the unseen. These books were disbelieved at the time, and remain discredited, principally because they treat of eccentric and seemingly impossible things. It is, however, certain that we go but a very littl e way out of the usual learned track before we encounter puzzling matters, which may well set us investigating our knowledge, and looking with some suspicion upon its grounds, spite of all the pompous claims of modern philosophers, who are continually, on account of their conceitedness, making sad mistakes, and breaking down with their plausible systems. “Progress and enlightenment are prerogatives to which no generation in particular can lay a special claim,” says a modern writer, speaking of railways and their invention. “Intelligence like that of the Stephensons is born again and again, at lengthened intervals; and it is only these giants in wisdom who know how to carry on to perfection the knowledge which centuries have been piling up before them. But the age in which such men are cast is often unequal to appreciate the genius which seeks to elevate its aspiration. Thus it was in 1820 that Mr. William Brougham proposed to consign George Stephenson to Bedlam, for being the greatest benefactor of his ti me. But now that we"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE PHILOSOPHER HUME. 37 have adopted somewhat fully his rejected ideas of steam - locomotion and high rates of speed, which were with so much difficulty forced upon us, we complacently call our - selves ‘enlightened;’ and doubtless we are tolerably safe in doin g so, considering that the Stephensons, and similar scientific visionaries, no longer live to contradict us.” We might add, that the Rosicrucians hold their critics in light esteem —indeed in very light esteem. If such is the disbelief of science of everyd ay use, what chance of credit has the abstruser knowledge, and those assertions of power which contradict our moat ordinary ideas of possibility? Common sense will answer, None at all. And yet all human conclusions and resolutions upon points which have been considered beyond the possibility of contradiction have been sometimes at fault. The most politic course is not too vigorously to take our stand upon any supposed fixed point of truth, but simply to admit that our knowledge is limited, that absolute truth is alone in the knowledge of God, and that no more truth is vouchsafed to man than he knows how to utilise: most of his uses, even of his little quantum of truth, being perverted. He must await other states for greater light, and to become a higher creature —should that be his happy destiny. As to certainty in this world, there is none —nor can there be any. Whether there is anything outside of man is uncertain. Hume has pointed out that there is no sequence between one and two. Other philosopher s have ingeniously detected that our senses are all one, or all none. Man is the picture painted upon external matter, and external matter is the individuality that surveys the picture. In the world of physics, colours are tones in other senses, and ton es are colours; sevenfold in either case, as the planetary powers and influences are septenary —which, in the ideas of the Rosicrucians, produce both.

The ribbons depending from the discus, or ring, through which the may - pole pierces, should be of the seven prismatic colours —those of the rainbow (or Règne beau ). According to the Gnostics and their Remains, Ancient and Medi æval , a wor k by the Rev. C.W. King, M.A., published in 1864 , Horapollo has preserved a talisman, or Gnostic gem, in yellow jasper, which presents the engraved figure of a “Cynocephalus, crowned, with bâton erect, adoring the first appearance of the new moon.” The pha llic worship prevailed, at one time, all over India. It constitutes, as Mr. Sellon asserts, to this day one of the chief, if not the leading, dogma of the Hindoo religion. In - contestable evidence could be adduced to prove this —how - ever strange and imposs ible it seems —the key of all worship the world over; and highest in esteem in the most highly civilised nations. Though it has degenerated into gross and sensual superstition, it was originally intended as the worship of the creative principle in Nature. Innumerable curious particulars lie scattered up and down, in all coun - tries of the world, relating to this worship, mad as it seems —bad as, in its grossness, it is. It is only in modern times that sensuality, and not sublimity, has been actively asso - t"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"ORIGIN OF THE FLEUR-DE-LIS. 39 ciated with this worship, however. There was a time when the rites connected with it were grand and solemn enough. The general diffusion of these notions regarding the Phalli and the Ioni , and of the sacred mystic suggestions implied in both, as well as the inflections in design of these unlikely, repulsive figures for serious worship, prove that there was something very extraordinary, and quite beyond belief to the moderns, in the origin of them. The religion of the Phallos (and of its twin emblem) is t o be traced all over the East. It prevailed not only amongst the Hindoos, Assyrians, Babylonians, Mexicans, Etruscans, Greeks, and Romans, in ancient times, but it still forms an integral part of the worship of India, Thibet, China, Siam, Japan, and Afri ca. We cannot, therefore, afford to ignore this grand scheme of ritual, when we discover it to be a religion so widely spread, and reappearing so unexpectedly, not only in the countries with which we are contemporaneously acquainted, but also in those old countries of which we in reality know very little, or nothing at all; for all history reads doubtfully, being written for popular purposes. In the Temple -Herren of Nicolai there is an account of a Gnostic gem, or talisman, which represents a “Cyno - cephal us,” with a lunar disc on his head, standing in the act of adoration , with sceptrum displayed, before a column engraved with letters, and supporting a triangle. This latter architectural figure is, in fact, an obelisk. All the Egyptian, obelisks were Ph alli . The triangle symbolises one of the Pillars of Hermes (Hercules). The Cynocephalus was sacred to him. The Pillars of Hermes have been Judaiscd into Solomon's “Jachin and Boaz.” So says Herz, in regard to “Masonic Insignia.” We will explain fully, later in our book, of these interesting sexual images, set up for adoration so strangely; and from the meaning of which we foolishly but determinedly avert. We now propose to deduce a very original and a very elaborate genealogy, or descent, of the famou s arms of France, the Fleurs -de-Lis , “ Lucifera ” Lisses , Luces, “Lu -"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 40 cies,” Bees, Scarabs, Scara - bees, or Imperial “Bees” of Charlemagne, and of Napoleon the First and Napoleon the Third, from a very extraordinary and (we will, in the fullest assurance, add) the most unexpected point of view. The real beginning of these inexpressibly sublime arms (or this “badge”), although in itself, and apart from its purpose, it is the most refined, but mysteriously grand, in the world, contradictory as it may seem, is al so the most ignoble. It has been the crux of the antiquaries and of the heralds for centuries! We would rather be excused the mentioning of the peculiar item which has thus been held up to the highest honour (heraldically) throughout the world. It will b e suffi - cient to say that mystically, in its theological, Gnostic allusion, it is the grandest device and most stupendous hint that armory ever saw; and those who are qualified to apprehend our hidden meaning will perhaps read correctly and perceive our end by the time that they have terminated this strange section of our history of Rosicnicianism — for to it it refers particularly. Scarabæei, Lucifera (“Light - bringers”), Luce, Fleur - de - Lis, Lily, Lucia, Lucy, Lux, Lu(+)x. The Luce is the old - fashioned name for the “pike” or jack — a fish famous for the profuse generation of a certain insect, as some fishermen know full well. This once (in - credible as it may seem) formed an object of worship, for the sake of the inexpressibly sublime things which it sym - boli sed. Although so mean in itself, and although so far off, this implied the beginning of all sublunary things. The bees of Charlemagne, the bees of the Empire in France, are “scarabs,” or figures of the same affinity as the Bourbon “lilies.” They deduce f rom a common ancestor. Now, the colour heraldic on which they are always em - blazoned is azure , or blue — which is the colour of the sea, which is salt. In an anagram it may be expressed as “C.” Following on this allusion, we may say that “Ventre - saint - gr is!” is a very ancient French barbarous expletive, or oath. Literally (which, in the occult sense, is always obscurely), it is the “Sacred blue (or gray) womb,” — which is absurd."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"STRANGE MYTHS. 41 Now, the reference and the meaning of this we will confi - dently commit to the penetration of those among our readers who can felicitously privately surmise it; and also the ap - parently circuitous deductions, which are yet to come, to be made by us. Blue is the colour of the “Virgin Maria.” Maria, Mary, mare, mar, mam, means the “ bitterness,” or the “saltness,” of the sea. Blue is expressive of the Hellenic, Isidian, Ionian, Fonian (Foni -Indian) Watery, Female, and Moon - like Principle in the universal theogony. It runs through all the mythologies. The “Lady -Bird,” or “Lady -Cow” (there is no resem - blance between a bird and a cow, it may be remarked en passant , except in this strangely occult, almost ridiculous, affinity), and the rustic rhyme among the children concern - ing it, may be here remembered : “ Lady -Bird, Lady -Bird , fly away home ! Your House is on fire —your children at home !” Such may be heard in all parts of England when a lady -bird is seen by the children. Myths are inextricably embodied —like specks and straws and flies in amber —amidst the sayings and rhymes o f the common people in all countries; and they are there preserved for very many generations, reappearing to recognition after. the lapse sometimes of centuries. Now, how do we explain and re -render the above rude couplet? The “Lady -Bird” is the “Virgin Maria,” Isis, the “Mother and Producer of Nature;” the “House” is the “Ecliptic” —it is figuratively “on fire,” or “of fire,” in the path of the sun; and the “children at home” are the “months” produced in the house of the sun, or the solar year, or the “s igns of the Zodiac” —which were originally “ten,” and not “twelve,” * each sign answering * “Lady -Cow, Lady -Cow, All but a Little One Fly away home !

Your House is of Fire — your Children are Ten! ” The name of the flying insect called in England “Lady - Bird” is Bête - à - Dieu in French, which means “God - creature,” or “God's creature.” The Napoleonic green is the mythic, magic green of Venus. The Emerald is the Smaragdus or Smaragd. The name of the insect Barnabee, Barnbee, “Burning Fire - Fly,” whose house is of fire, whose children are ten, is Red Chafer , Rother - Kaefer , Sonnen - Kaefer , Unser - Frawen Kohlein , in German; it is “Sun - Chafer,” “Our Lady’s Litt le Cow,” Isis, or Io, or C — ow, in English. The children Tenne ( Tin , or Tien , is fire in some languages) are the earliest \"Ten Signs \"in the Zodiacal Heavens — each “Sign” with its Ten Decans, or Decumens, or “Lenders of Hosts.” They are also astronomicall y called “Stalls,” or “Stables.” We may here refer to Porphyry, Horapollo, and Chifflet’s Gnostic Gems. The Speckled Beetle was flung into hot water to avert storms (Pliny, Nat. Hist. , lib. xxxvii., ch. x.) The antiquary Pignorius has a beetle “crowne d with the sun and encircled with the serpent.” Amongst the Gnostic illustrations published by Abraham Gorlæeus is that of a talisman of the more abstruse Gnostics — an onyx carved with a “beetle which threatens to gnaw at a thunderbolt.” See Notes and Qu eries ; “Bee Mytho - logy.” The “Lilies” are said not to have appeared in the French arms until the time of Philip Augustus.

The motto placed under the “lilies,” which are the arms of Fran ce, runs as follows: “Lilia non laborant, neque nent.” This is also (as all know) the legend, or motto, accompany - ing the royal order of knighthood denominated that of the “Saint -Esprit,” in France. We are immediately now re - called to those exceedingly ob scure, but very significant, words of our Saviour, which have always seemed very erroneously interpreted, on account of their obvious con - tradictions: “Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.” * Now, in rega rd to this part of the text, what does the judicious speculator think of the following Rosicrucian gloss, or ex - planation?

Thus comes the word “Lich - gate.” Lich in the Anglo - Saxon means a “dead body.” See Notes and Queries , vol. ii. p. 4 . The “Lych - gates” were as a sort of triumphal arches ( Propylæa ) placed before the church, as the outwork called the “Propylon,” or “ Propylæum,” was advanced before the Egyptian and the Grecian temples. They are found, in the form of separate arches, before the gates even of Chinese cities, and they are there generally called “triumphal arches.” Propylæa is a name of Hecate, Dis, Chron os, or the P , to which sinister deity the Propylon or Propylæum (as also, properly, the Lych - gate) is dedicated.

CHAPTER THE EIGHTH. SACRED FIRE. HE appearance of God to mortals seems always to have been in brightness and great glory, whether He was angry and in displeasure, or benign and kind. These appearances are often mentioned in Scripture. When God appeared on Mount Sinai, it is said, “The Lord descended upon it in Fire” (Exodus xix. 18 ). And wh en Moses repeats the history of this to the children of Israel, he says, “The Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the Fire” (Deuteronomy iv. 12 ). So it was when the Angel of the Lord appeared to Moses in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush:”T he bush burned with Fire, and the bush was not consumed” (Exodus iii. 3 ). The appearances of the Angel of God’s presence, or that Divine Person who represented God, were always in brightness; or, in other words, the Shechinah was always surrounded with gl ory. This seems to have given occasion to those of old to imagine fire to be what God dwelt in. “Ipse” (Darius) “solem Mithren, sacrumque et æternum invocans I GNEM , ut illis dignam vetere gloris majoremque monumentis fortitudinem inspirarent.” — Q.

It is certain that in t"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"SOLOMON’S TEMPLE. 55 after ages this was the case. We are sure that a fire fro m the Lord consumed upon the altar the burnt -offering of Aaron (Leviticus ix. 24 ); and so it did the sacrifice of Gideon, “both the flesh and the unleavened cakes” (Judges vi. 21 ). When David “built an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt -offerings and peace -offerings, and called upon the Lord, He answered him from heaven by Fire, upon the altar of burnt -offerings” ( 1 Chronicles xxi. 26 ). The same thing happened at the dedication of Solomon’s temple: “The Fire came down from heaven, and consumed the bur nt-offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the house” ( 2 Chronicles vii. i). And much about a hundred years afterwards, when Elijah made that extra - ordinary sacrifice in proof that Baal was no god, “The Fire of the Lord fell and con sumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench” ( 1 Kings xviii. 38 ). And if we go back long before the times of Moses, as early as Abraham’s days, we meet with an instance of the same sort: “It came to pass that when the sun went down, and it was dark, be - hold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp, that passed between these pieces” (Genesis xv. 17 ). The first appearances of God, then, being in glory —or, which is the same thing, in light or fire —and He showing His acceptance of sacrifices in so many instances by con - suming them with fire, hence it was that the Eastern people, and particularly the Persians, fell into the worship of fire itself, or rather they conceived fire to be the symbo l of God’s presence, and they worshipped God in, or by, fire. From the Assyrians, or Chaldeans, or Persians, this worship was propagated southward among the Egyptians, and west - ward among the Greeks; and by them it was brought into Italy. The Greeks wer e wont to meet together to worship in their Prytamia , and there they consulted for the public good; and there was a constant fire kept upon the altar, which was dignified by the name of Vesta by some. The fire itself was properly Vesta; and so Ovid: “Nec te aliud Vestam, quam vivam intelligere flammam.”"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 56 The Prytaneia were the atria of the temples, wherein a fire was kept that was never suffered to go out. On the change in architectural forms from the pyramidal (or the horizontal) to the obeliscar (or the upright, or vertical), the flames were transferred from the altars, or cubes, to the summits of the typical uprights, or towers; or to the tops of the candles, such as we see them used now in Catholic worship, and which are called “tapers,” from their t apering or pyramidal form, and which, wherever they are seen or raised, are supposed always to indicate the divine presence or influence. This, through the symbolism that there is in the living light, which is the last exalted show of fluent or of inflame d brilliant matter, passing off beyond into the unknown and unseen world of celestial light (or occult fire), to which all the forms of things tend, and in which even idea itself passes from recognition as meaning, and evolves — spiring up, as all flame doe s, to escape and to wing away. Vesta, or the fire, was worshipped in circular temples, which were the images, or the miniatures, of the “temple” of the world, with its dome, or cope, of stars. It was in the atria of the temples, and in the presence of and before the above - mentioned lights, that the forms of ceremonial worship were always observed. It is certain that Vesta was wor - shipped at Troy; and Æneas brought her into Italy : “manibus vittas, Vestamque potentem, Æternumque adytis effert penetralibus Ignem.” Æneid , ii. 296 . Numa settled an order of Virgin Priestesses, whose business and care it was constantly to maintain the holy fire. And long before Numa’s days, we find it not only customary, but honourable, among the Albans to appoint the best - bor n virgins to be priestesses of Vesta, and to keep up the con - stant, unextinguished fire. When Virgil speaks (Æneid, iv. 200 ) of Iarbas, in Africa, as building a hundred temples and a hundred altars, he says “vigilemque sacraverat Ignem, Excubias Divûm set ernas,” —"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"VESTAL FIRES. 57 that he had “consecrated a fire that never went out.” And he calls these temples and these lights, or this fire, the “perpetual watches” or “watch -lights,” or proof of the presence, of the gods. By which expressions he means, that places and th ings were constantly protected, and solemnised where such lights burned, and that the celestials, or angel -defenders, “camped,” as it were, and were sure to be met with thickly, where these flames upon the altars, and these torches or lights about the temp les, invited them and were studiously and incessantly maintained. Thus the custom seems to have been general from the earliest antiquity to maintain a constant fire, as conceiving the gods present there. And this was not only the opinion of the inhabitant s in Judæa, but it extended all over Persia, Greece, Italy, Egypt, and most other nations of the world. Porphyry imagined that the reason why the most ancient mortals kept up a constant, ever -burning fire in honour of the immortal Gods, was because Fire wa s most like the Gods. He says that the ancients kept an unextinguished fire in their temples to the Gods because it was most like them. Fire was not like the Gods, but it was what they appeared in to mortals. And so the true God always appeared in brig htness and glory; yet no one would say that brightness was most like the true God, but was most like the Shechinah, in which God appeared. And hence the custom arose of keeping up an unextinguished fire in the ancient temples. Vesta is properly an Orient al word, derived from the Hebrew ca , As —“Fire.” Thence the word Astarte, in the Phœnician dialect. The signification of the term is the sam e as the pàr ¥sbestoj , the ignis æternus , the perpetual fire itself . They that worshipped either Vesta or Vulcan, o r the master - power of nature which is known under those names, were properly Fire -worshippers. God, then, being wont to appear in Fire, and being con - ceived to dwell in Fire, the notion spread universally, and was universally admitted. First, then, it w as not at all out of the way to think of engaging in friendship with God by"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 58 the same means as they contracted friendship with one another. And since they to whom God appeared saw Him appear in Fire, and they acquainted others with such His appearances, He was conceived to dwell in Fire. By degrees, therefore, the world came to be over - curious in the fire that was constantly to be kept up, and in things to be sacrificed; and they proceeded from one step to another, till at length they filled up the measu re of their aberration, which was in reality instigated by their zeal, and by their intense desire to mitigate the displeasure of their divinities — for religion was much more intense as a feeling in early days — by passing into dreadful ceremonies in regard to this fire, which they reverenced as the last possible physical form of divinity, not only in its grandeur and power, but also in its purity. It arose from this view that human sacrifices came to be offered to the deities in many parts of the world, pa rticularly in Phœnicia, and in the colonies derived from thence into Africa and other places. In the intensity of their minds, children were sacrificed by their parents, as being the best and dearest oblation that could be made, and the strongest argumen ts that nothing ought to be with - held from God. This was expiation for that sad result, the consequence of the original curse, issuing from the fatal curio - sity concerning the bitter fruit of that forbidden “Tree,” “whose mortal taste Brought death into the world, and all our woe, With loss of Eden,” according to Milton. That peculiar natural sense of shame in all its forms lesser and larger, and with all the references inseparably allied to propagation in all its multitudinous cunning (so to speak), wher ever the condemned material, tissues reach, puzzled the thoughtful ancients as to its mean - ing. This they considered the convicted “Adversary,” or Lucifer, “Lord of Light” — that is, material light — “Eldest Son of the Morning.” Morning, indeed! dawning w ith its light from behind that forbidden Tree of the Know - ledge of Good and Evil.

What is this shame, which is the characteristic singly of human creatures? All other creatures are sinless in this respect, and know not the feeling of that —correctly looked at —strange thing which men call “shame,” something which is not right that the sun even should see, and therefore stirring the blood, and reddening the face, and confusing the speech, and causing man to hang down his head, and to hide himself, as if guilty of something: even as our guil ty first parents, having lost the unconsciousness of their childlike, innocent first state —that of sinless virginity —hid themselves and shunned their own light in the umbrage of Paradise, all at once con - victed to the certainty that they must hide, becau se they were exposed, and that they had themselves broken that original intention regarding them. “Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.” That is, the innocent children should come up for sal va- tion, who, though suffering under the mortal liability incurred by all flesh in that first sin (and incident in the first fall, which has empoisoned and cursed all nature), are yet free by the nature of their ungrown possibility, and from their unconsc iousness of it. They know not the shame of the condition adult, and therefore they bear not the badge of men, and are not of this world really, but of another world. To recur for a moment to the theory of human sacrifices which once largely prevailed.

This is observable in the innumerable masks (or heads full - faced) placed on the keystones of arches or portals. They are either deified mortals or demi - gods.

(Museum, Lond. Univ.) CHAPTER THE NINTH. FIRE - THEOSOPHY OF THE PERSIANS. HE Fire - Philosophers, or Philosophi per ignem , were a fanatical sect of philosophers, who appeared towards the close of the sixteenth century. They made a figure in almost all the countries of Europe. They delcared that the intimate essences of natural things were only to be known by the trying efforts of fire, directed in a chemical process. The Theosophists also insisted that human reason was a dangerous and de - ceitful guide; that no real progress could be made in know - ledge or in religion by it; and that to all vital — that is, su pernatural — purpose it was a vain thing. They taught that divine and supernatural illumination was the only means of arriving at truth. Their name of Paracelsists was derived from Paracelsus, the eminent physician and chemist, whowas the chief ornament o f this extraordinary sect. In England, Robert Flood, or Fludd, was their great advocate and exponent. Rivier, who wrong in France; Severinus, an author of Denmark; Kunrath, an eminent phyisican of Dresden; and Daniel Hoffmann, professor of divinity in t he University of Helmstadt, — have also treated largely on Paracelsus and on his system.

These practised che - mistry, by which they asserted that they could explore the profoundest secrets of nature. As they stro ve, above all earthly knowledge, after the divine, and sought the divine light and fire, through which all men can acquire the true wisdom, they were called the Fire - Philosophers ( philosophi per ignem ). The most distinguished of these are Theo - phrastus Pa racelsus, Adam von Boden, Oswald Croll; and, later, Valentine Weigel, Robert Flood, or Fludd, Jacob Bohmen, Peter Poiret, &c.” Under this head we may also refer to the Medico - surgical Essays of Hemmann, published at Berlin in 1778 ; and Pfaff’s Astrology. As a great general principle, the Theosophists called the soul a fire, taken from the eternal ocean of light. In regard to the supernatural — using the word in its widest sense — it may be said that “all the difficulty in admitting the strange things told us l ies in the non - admis -"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"ZOROASTER AND THE MAGI. 67 sion of an internal causal world as absolutely real: it is said, in intellectually admitting, because the influence of the arts proves that men’s feelings always have admitted, and do still admit, this reality.” The Platonic philosophy of vision is, that it is the view of objects really existing in interior light, which assume form, not according to arbitrary laws, but according to the state of mind. This interior light, if we understand Plato, unites with exterior light in the eye, and is thus drawn into a sensual or imaginative activity; but when the outward light is separated, it reposes in its own serene atmosphere. It is, then, in this state of interior repose, that the usual class of religious, or what are called inspired, vis ions occur. It is the same light of eternity so frequently alluded to in books that treat of mysterious subjects; the light revealed to Pimander, Zoroaster, and all the sages of the East, as the emanation of the spiritual sun. Bohmen writes of it in his Divine Vision or Contemplation, and Molinos in his Spiritual Guide, —whose work is the ground of Quietism: Quietism being the foundation of the religion of the people called Friends or Quakers, as also of the other mystic or meditative sects.

Lights and flames, and the torches , as it were, of fire (all fire in this world, the last background on which all things are painted), may be considered as “lancets” of another world — the last world: circles, enclosed by the thick walls (which, however, by the fire are kept from closing) of t his world. As fire waves and brandishes, will the walls of this world wave, and, as it were, undulate from about it. In smoke and disruption, or combustion of matter, we witness a phenomenon of the burning as of the edges of the matter - rings of this wor ld, in which world is fire, like a spot: that dense and hard thing, matter, holding it in. Oxygen, which is the finest of air, and is the means of the quickest burning out, or the supernatural (in this world) exhilaration of animal life, or extenuation of the Solid; and, above all, the height - ening of the capacity of the Human, as being the quint - essence of matter: this oxygen is the thing which feeds fire the most overwhelming. Nor would the specks and spots and stars of fire stop in this dense world - m edium, — in this tissue or sea of things, — could it farther and farther fasten upon and devour the solids: eating, as it were, through them. But as this thick world is a thing the thickest, it presses out, thrusts, or gravitates upon, and stifles, in its too great weight; and conquers not only that liveliest, subtlest, thinnest element of the solids, the finest air, by whatever chemical name — oxygen , azote , azone , or what not — it may be called; which, in fact, is merely the nomenclature of its composition , the n aming of the ingredients which make the thing (but not the thing). The denseness of the world not only conquers this, we repeat; but, so to figure it, matter stamps upon, effaces, and treads out fire: which, else, would burn on, back, as in the beginning of things, or into itself, — consuming, as in its great revenge of any thing being created other than it , all the mighty worlds which, in Crea - tion, were permitted out of it. This is the teaching of the ancient Fire - Philosophers (reestablished and restore d, to the days of comprehension of them, in the conclusions of the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF FIRE. 71 Rosicrucians, or llluminati , of later times), who claimed to have discovered the Eternal Fire, or to have found out “God” in the “Immortal Light.” There are all grades or gradations of the density of matter; but it all coheres by the one law of gravitation. Now, this gravitation is mistaken for a force of itself, when it is nothing but the sympathy, or the taking, away of the supposed thing between two other things. It is sympathy (or app etite) seeking its food, or as the closing together of two like things. It is not because one mass of matter is more ponderable or attracting than another (out of our senses, and in reality), but that they are the same, with different amounts of affection , and that like seeks like, not recognising or knowing that between. Now, this thing which is, as it were, slipped between, and which we strike into show of itself, or into fire -surprised and driven out of its ambush —is Fire. It is as the letter by which matter spells itself out —so to speak. Now, matter is only to be finally forced asunder by heat; flame being the bright, subtle something which comes last, and is the expansion, fruit, crown, or glory of heat: it is the vivid and visible soul, essence, an d spirit of heat —the last evolvement before rending, and before the forcible closing again of all the centre -speeding weights, or desires, of matter. Flame is as the expanding -out (or even explod - ing ) flower to this growing thing, heat: it is as the bubbl e of it —the fruit (to which before we have likened it), or seed, in the outside Hand upon it. Given the supernatural Flora, heat is as the gorgeous plant, and flame the glorying flower; and as growth is greater out of the greater matrix , or matter of gr owing, so the thicker the material of fire (as we may roughly figure it, though we hope we shall be understood), so the stronger shall the fire be, and of neces - sity the fiercer will it be perceived to be —result being according to power.

These changes can be wrought in matter, and, as it were, it can be taken in pieces; and all this dissolution of it may be effected without our getting as at the fire - blood of our subject. But Fire disjoints, as it were, all the hinges of the house — laps out the coherence of it — sets ablaze the dense thing, matter — makes the dark metals run like waters of light — conjures the black devils out of the minerals, a nd, to our astonishment, shows them much libelled, blinding, angel - white! By Fire we can lay our hand upon the solids, part them, powder them, melt them, fine them, drive them out to more and more delicate and impalpable texture — firing their invisible m olecules, or imponderables, into cloud, into mist, into gas: out of touch, into hearing; out of hearing, into seeing; out of seeing, into smelling; out of smelling, into nothing — into real N OTHING — not even into the last blue sky.

IDEAS OF THE ROSICRUCIANS AS TO THE CHARACTER OF FIRE. PARK surrenders out of the world, when it dis - appears tous, in the universal ocean of Invisible Fire. That is its disappearance. It quits us in the supposed light, but to it really darkness — as fire - born . the last level of a ll — to reappear in the true light, which is to us darkness. This is hard to understand. But, as the real is the direct contrary of the apparent, so that which shows as light to us is darkness in the supernatural; and that which is light to the supernatura l is darkness to us: matter being darkness, and soul light. For we know that light is material; and being material, it must be dark. For the Spirit of God is not material, and therefore, not being material, it cannot be light to us, and therefore darknes s to God. Just as (until discovered otherwise) the world it is that is at rest, and the sun and the heavenly bodies in daily motion — instead of the very reverse being the fact. This is the belief of the oldest Theosophists, the founders of magi - cal knowle dge in the East, and the discoverers of the Gods; also the doctrines of the Fire - Philosophers, and of the Rosi - crucians, or Illuminati , who taught that all knowable things (both of the soul and of the body) were evolved out of Fire, s"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"STRANGE IDEAS OF THE FIRE-PHILOSOPHERS. 75 and finally resolvable into it: and that Fire was the last and only -to-be-known God: as that all things were capable of being searched down into it, and all things were capable of being thought up into it. Fire, they found —when, as it were, they took this world, solid, to piece s (and also, as metaphysicians, distributed and divided the mind of man, seeking for that invisible God -thing, coherence of ideas) — fire, these thinkers found, in their supernatural light of mind, to be the latent, nameless matter started out of the tissues —certainly out of the body, presumably out of the mind — with groan, disturbance, hard motion, and flesh (when forced to sight of it), instantly disappearing, and relapsing, and hiding its Godhead in the closing -violently -again solid matter —as into the forc efully resuming mind. Matter, the agent whose remonstrance at disturbance out of its Rest was, in the winds, murmurs, noises, cries, as it were, of air; in the waters, rolling and roaring; in the piled floors of the sky, and their furniture, clouds, circu mvolvence, contest, and war, and thunders (defiant to nature, but groans to God) and intolerable lightning -rendings; matter tearing as a garment, to close supernaturally together again, as the Solid, fettered and chained —devil -bound —in the Hand upon it, “To Be!” In this sense, all noise (as the rousing or con - juration of matter by the outside forces) is the agony of its penance. All motion is pain, all activity punishment; and fire is the secret, lowest —that is, foundation spread —thing, the ultimate of a ll things, which is disclosed when the clouds of things roll, for an instant, off it, —as the blue sky shows, in its fragments, like turquoises, when the canopy of clods is wind -torn, speck -like, from off it. Fire is that floor over which the coats or laye rs, or the spun kingdoms of matter, or of the subsidences of the past periods of time (which is built up of objects), are laid: tissues woven over a gulf of it: in one of which last, We Are.

The Fire - Philosophers maintained that we transcend everything into Fire, and that we lose it there in the flash; the escape of fire being as the door through which every - thing disappears to the other side. In their very peculiar speculations, and i n this stupendous and supernatural view of the universe, where we think that fire is the exception, and is, as it were, spotted over the world (in reality, to go out when it goes out ), they held that the direct contrary was the truth, and that we, and all things, were spotted upon fire; and that we conquer patches only of fire when we put it out, or win torches (as it were) out of the great flame , when we enkindle fire, — which is our master in the truth, making itself, in our beliefs (in our human needs), th e slave. Thus fire, when it is put out, only goes into the under world, and the matter - flags close over it like a grave - stone. When we witness Fire, we are as if peeping only through a door into another world. Into this, all the (consumed into microscopi cal smallness) things of this world, the com - pressed and concentrate matter - heaps of defunct tides of Being and of Time, are in combustion rushing: kingdoms of the floors of the things passed through — up to this moment held in suspense in the invisible in ner worlds.

It will appear no wonder now, if the above abstractions be caught by the Thinker, ho w it was that the early people (and the founders of Fire -Worship) considered that they saw God, standing face to face with Him —that is, with all that, in their innermost possibility of thought, they could find as God —in Fire. Which Fire is not our vulgar, gross fire; neither is it the purest material fire, which has some - thing of the base, bright lights of the world still about it — brightest though they be in the matter which makes them the Lightest to the material sight; but it is an occult, myste - rious, o r inner —not even magnetic, but a supernatural — Fire: a real, sensible, and the only possible Mind, or God, as containing all things, and as the soul of all things; into whose inexpressibly intense, and all -devouring and divine, though fiery, gulf, all the w orlds in succession, like ripe fruit to the ground, and all things, fall, —back into whose arms of Immortal Light: on the other side, as again receiv - ing them, all things, thrown off as the smoke off light, again fall! At the shortest, then, the theory of t he Magi may be summed up thus.

The views of these mighty thinkers amounted to the suppression of human reason, and the institution of ma gic, or godhead, as all. It will be seen at once that this knowledge was possible but for the very few.

They bespoke, where ver found, and in whatever age, the idea of the First Principle, or the male generative emblem. Having given, as we hope, some new views of the doctrine of Universal Fire, and shown that there has been error in imagining that the Persians and the ancient F ire -Worship - pers were idolaters simply of fire, inasmuch as, in bowing down before it, they only regarded Fire as a symbol, or visible sign, or thing placed as standing for the Deity, — having, in our preceding chapters, disposed the mind of th reader to co nsider as a matter of solemnity, and of much greater general significance, this strange fact of Fire -Worship, and endeavoured to show it as a portentous, first, all -embrac - ing as all -genuine principle, —we will proceed to exemplify the wide -spread roots of the Fire -Faith.

They had ar rived at a new world in their speculations and"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 80 deductions upon facts, upon all the things behind which (to men) make these facts. Already, in their determined climbing into the heights of thought, had these Titans of mind achieved, past the cosmical, thro ugh the shadowy borders of Real and Unreal, into Magic. For, is Magic wholly false ? Passing through these mind - worlds, and coming out, as we may figure it, at the other side , penetrating into the secrets of things, they evaporated all Powers, and resolve d them finally into the Last Fire. Beyond this, they found nothing; as into this they resolved all things. And then, on the Throne of the Visible, they placed this — in the world, Invisible — Fire: the sense - thing to be worshipped in the senses, as the las t thing of them, and the king of them, — that is, that which we know as the phenomenon, Burning Fire, — the Spiritual Fire being impalpable, as having the visible only for its shadow; the Ghostly Fire not being even to be thought upon; thought being its mediu m of appre - hension when it itself had slipped; the waves of apprehen - sion of it only flowing back when it — being intuition — had vanished. We only know that a thought is in us when the thought is off the object and in us: another thought being, at that sim ultaneous instant, in the object, to be taken up by us only when the first has gone out of us, and so on; but not before to be taken up by us; — that thought being all of us , and a deceptive and unreal thing to pass at all to us through the reason, and th ere being no resemblance between it and its original; the true thing being “Inspir - ation,” or “God in us,” excluding all matter or reason, which is only built up of matter.

It is equally in the beliefs and in the traditions of all nations and of all time, as we sha ll by and by show. Real Light is God’s shadow, or the soul of matter; the one is the very brighter, as the other is the very blacker. Thus, the worshippers of the Sun, or Light, or Fire, whether in the Old or the New Worlds, worshipped not Sun, or Light, or Fire, —otherwise they would have worshipped the Devil, he being all conceivable Light; but rather they adored the Unknown Great God, in the last image that was possible to man of anything —the Fire. And they chose that as His shadow, as the very opposi te of that which He really was; honouring the Master through His Servant; bowing before the manifestation, Eldest of Time, for the Timeless; paying homage to the spirit of the Devil -World, or rather to Beginning and End, on which was the foot of the A LL , t hat the A LL , or the L AST , might be worshipped; propitiating the Evil Principle in its finite shows, because (as by that alone a world could be made, whose making is alone Comparison) it was per - mitted as a means of God, and therefore the operation of God Downwards, as part of Him, though Upwards dissipat - ing as before Him, —before H IM in whose presence Evil, or Comparison, or Difference, or Time, or Space, or any - thing, should be Impossible: real God being not to be thought upon.

Narrowly considered, it will be found that all religions transcend up into this spiritual Fire - Floor, on which, to speak metaphysically, the phases of Time were laid. Material Fire, which is the brighter as the matter which constitutes it is the blacke r, is the shadow (so to express, or to speak, necessarily with “words,” which have no mean - ing in the spirit) of the “Spirit - Light,” which invests itself in it as the mask in which alone it can be possible. Thus, material light being the very opposite of God, the Egyptians — who were undoubtedly acquainted with the Fire - Revela - tion — could not represent God as light. They therefore expressed their Idea of Deity by darkness. Their chief adoration was paid to Darkness . They bodied the Eternal forth under Da rkness. In the early times before the Deluge, — of which “phe - nomenon,” as there remains a brighter or fainter tradition of it among all the peoples of the globe, it must be true, — Man walked with the Knowledge of Spirit in him.

It would seem universally to refer to the single Supernatural Tradition —all that is heired out of Time. A mysterious Cabalistic volume of high repute, and of the greatest antiquity, is the “Book of Light,” whose doctrine divides. The first dogma is th at of “Light -Enlightened” or “Self -Existent,” which signifies God, or the Light Spiritual, which is darkness in the world, or Manifestation or Creation. This Light -Enlightened is Inspiration, or blackness to men (God), opposed to knowledge, or bright - ness to men (the Devil). The second Light is the En - lightening Light, or the Material Light, which is the pro - ducer, foundation, and God of this World ,—proceeding, nevertheless, from God; for He is AIl.

Have historians and antiquaries carefully weighed the fact (even in the name of the Pyramids), that Pyr , or Pur , in the Greek, means Fire? We would argue that that object, in the Great Pyramid, which has been mistaken for a tomb (and which is, moreover, rather fashioned like an altar, smooth and plain, without any carved work), is , in reality, the vase, urn, or depository, of the sacred, ever - burning fire: of the existence of which ever - living, inextinguishable fire, to be found at some period of the world’s history, there is abundant tradition. This view is fortified by the state ments of Diodorus, who writes that “Cheops, or Chemis, who founded the principal Pyramid, and Cephren, or Cephrenus, who built the next to it, were neither buried here, but that they were deposited elsewhere.” Cheops, Cephrenus, and Mycerinus, the mighty b uilders of these super - gigantic monuments, of which it is said that they look as if intended to resist the waste of the ages, and, as in a front of supernatural and sublime submission, to await, in the undulation of Time (as in the waves of cen - turies), t he expected revolution of nature, and the new and recommencing series of existence, surely had in view some - thing grander, something still more universally portentous, than sepulture — or even death !

We consid er all these as varia - tions of the upright commemorative pillar. The province of Brittany, in France, is thickly studded with stone pillars, and the history and manners of its people teem with interesting, and very curious, traces of the worship of them. In these parts, and elsewhere, they are distinguished by the name of Menhirs and Penlvans . The superstitious veneration of the Irish people for such stones is well known. M. de Freminville says in his Antiquités du Finisterre , p. 106 : “The Celts worshippe d a divinity which united the attributes of Cybele and Venus.” This worship prevailed also in Spain, —as, doubtless, throughout Europe, —inas - much as we find the Eleventh and Twelfth Councils of Toledo warning those who offered worship to stones that they w ere sacrificing to devils. We are taught that the Druidical institution of Britain was Pythagorean, or patriarchal, or Brahminical. The pre - sumed universal knowledge which this order possessed, and the singular customs which they practised, have afforded sufficient analogies and affinities to maintain the occult and remote origin of Druidism. A Welsh antiquary insists that the Druidical system of the Metempsychosis was conveyed to the Brahmins of India by a former emigration from Wales. But the reverse may have occurred, if we trust the elaborate researches which would demonstrate that the Druids were a scion of the Oriental family. The reader is referred to Toland’s History of the Druids , in his Miscel - laneous Works, vol. ii. p. 163 ; also to a book pu blished in. London in 1829 , with the title, The Celtic Druids; or. An Attempt to show that the Druids were the Priests of Oriental Colonies, who emigrated from India ,—by Godfrey Higgins. A recent writer confidently intimated that the knowledge"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 102 of Druidism must be searched for in the Talmudical writ - ings; but another, in return, asserts that the Druids were older than the Jews. Whence and when the British Druids transplanted them - selves to this lone world amid the ocean, no historian can write. We can ju dge of the Druids simply — by the sublime monuments which are left of them, surviving, in their ma - jestic loneliness, through the ages of civilisation. Unhewn masses or heaps of stones tell alone their story; such are their cairns , and cromlechs , and corne ddes , and that wild architecture, whose stones hang on one another, still frown - ing on the plains of Salisbury. Among the most remarkable ancient remains in Wales (both North and South) are the Druidical stones: poised in the most extraordinary manner, — a r eal engineering pro - blem, — the slightest touch will sometimes suffice to set in motion the Logan , or rocking, stones, whether these balanced masses are found in Wales or elsewhere. We think that there is very considerable ground for concluding that all the se mounted stones were oracular, or, so to express it, speaking; and that, when sought for divine responses, they were caused first to tremble, then to heave, and finally, like the tables of the modern (so - called) Spiritualists, to tip intel - ligibly. To no other reason than this could we satisfactorily refer the name under which they are known in Wales: namely, “bowing - stones.” For the idea that they were denominated “bowing - stones” because to the people they formed objects of adoration is a supposition infinitely less satisfactory. The reader will perceive that we admit the phenomenon, when the mysterious rapport is effected, of the spontaneous sensitiveness and ultimate sympathetic motion of solid objects. No one who has witnessed the strange, unexpla ined power which tables, after proper pre - paration, acquire of supplying intelligent signals, — impossible as it may seem to those who have not witnessed and tested these phenomena, — but will see that there is great likeli - hood of these magic stones having been reared and haunted by the people for this special sensitive capacity.

The universal signal was reproduced through the phases of architecture. The supposition that the object of the steeple was to point out the church to the surrounding country explains but half its meaning.

At one time the ancient Bale, Bel, or religious fires of Ireland were general all over the country. They have been clearly traced to a devotional origin, and are strictly of the same character as the magic, or Magian, fires of the East. During the political discontents of 1831 and 1832 , the custom of light - ing these signal - fires was very g enerally revived amidst the party - distractions in Ireland. In the ancient language of this country, the month of May is yet called “ nic Beal tienne ,” or the month of Beal (Bel or Baal’s) fire. The Beltane festival in the Highlands has been ascribed to a similar origin. Druidical altars are still to be traced on many of the hills in Ireland, where Baal (Bel or Beal) fires were lighted. Through the countries, in the present day, which formed the ancient Scandinavia, and in Germany, particularly in the No rth, on the first of May, as in cele - bration of some universal feast or festival, fires are even now lighted on the tops of the hills. How closely this prac - tice accords with the superstitious usages of the Bohemians, or “Fire - kings,” of Prague, is disc overable at a glance. All these western flames are representative of the early fire, which was as equally the object of worship of the Gubhs, Guebres, or Gaurs of Persia, as it is the admitted natural principle of the Parsees.

HE definition of a miracle has been exposed to numer ous erroneous views. Inquirers know not what a miracle is. It is wrong to assume that nature and human nature are alike invariably, and that you can interpret the one by the other. There may be in reality great divergence between the two, though b oth start from the common point — individuality. A miracle is not a violation of the laws of nature (because nature is not everything), but a something independent of all laws, — that is, as we know laws . The mistake that is so commonly made is the interpre ting — or rather the perceiving, or the becoming aware of — that thing we denominate a miracle through the operation of the human senses, which in reality have nothing whatever to do with a miracle, because they cannot know it. If nature, as we understand it, or law, as we understand it, be universal, then, as nothing can be possible to us which contradicts either the one or the other (both being the same), — nature being law, and law being nature, — miracle must be impossible, and there never was, nor could ther e ever be, such a thing as a miracle. But a miracle works outwardly from us at once, and not by a human path — moves away from the world (that is, man’s t"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"QUESTIONS AS TO DREAMS. 115 world) as a thing impossible to it, though it may be true none the less, since our nature is not all na ture, nor perhaps any nature, but even a philosophical delusion. In the conception of a miracle, however, the thing apprehended revolves to us, and can come to us in no other way, and we seize the idea of it through a machinery, our own judg - ment, —which i s a clear sight compounded of our senses, — a synthesis of senses that, in the very act of presenting an impossible idea, destroys it as humanly possible. Miracle can be of no date or time, whether earlier, whether later, if God has not withdrawn from natu re; and if He has withdrawn from nature, then nature must have before this fallen to pieces of herself; for God is intelligence —not life only; and matter is not intelligent, though it may be living. It is not seen that during that space —which is a space taken out of time, though independent of it —in which miracle is possible to us, we cease to be men, because time, or rather sensation, is man’s measure; and that when we are men again, and back in ourselves, the miracle is gone, because the conviction of the possibility of a thing and its non -possibility has expelled it. The persuasion of a miracle is intuition, or the operation of God’s Spirit active in us, that drives out nature for the time, which is the opposite of the miracle. No miracle can be just ified to men’s minds, because no amount of evidence can sustain it; no number of attesta - tions can affirm that which we cannot in our nature believe. In reality, we believe nothing of which our senses do not convince us, —even these not always. In other m atters, we only believe because we think that we believe; and since the conviction of a miracle has nothing of God except the certain sort of motive of possessed, excluding exaltation, which, with the miracle , fills us, and to which exultation we can give no name, and which we can only feel as a certain something in us, a certain power and a certain light, con - quering and outshining another light, become fainter, —it will follow that the conviction of the possibility of a miracle is the same sort of unquesti oning assurance that we have"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 116 of a dream in the dream itself; and that, when the miracle is apprehended in the mind, it just as much ceases to be a miracle when we are in our senses, as a dream ceases to be that which it was, a reality, and becomes that which it it is, nonentity, when we awake. But to the questions, what is a dream? — nay, what is waking? — who shall answer? or who can declare whether in that broad outside, where our minds and their powers evaporate or cease, where nature melts away into no thing that we can know as nature, or know as anything else, in regard to dreams and realities, the one may not be the other? The dream may be man’s life to him, — as another life other than his own life, — and the reality may be the dream (in its various for ms), which he rejects as false and confusion simply because it is as an unknown language, of which, out of his dream, he can never have the alphabet, but of which, in the dream, he has the alphabet, and can spell well because that life is natural to him. “ A pretence that every strong and peculiar expression is merely an Eastern hyperbole is a mighty easy way of getting rid of the trouble of deep thought and right apprehension, and has helped to keep the world in ignorance.” — Morsels of Criticism , London, 180 0 . It is very striking that, in all ages, people have clothed the ideas of their dreams in the same imagery. It may therefore be asked whether that language, which now oc - cupies so low a place in the estimation of men, be not the actual waking language o f the higher regions, while we, awake as we fancy ourselves, may be sunk in a “sleep of many thousand years, or, at least, in the echo of their dreams, and only intelligibly catch a few dim words of that language of God. as sleepers do scattered expression s from the loud conversation of those around them.” So says Schubert, in his Symbolism of Dreams . There is every form of the dream - state, from the faintest to the most intense, in which the gravitation of the outside world overwhelms the man - senses, and absorbs the inner unit. In fact, the lightest and faintest form of dream is the very thoughts that we think ."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"REAL WORLD’S BUSINESS IN DREAMS. 117 A very profound English writer, Thomas de Quincey, has the following: “In the English rite of Confirmation, by personal choice, and by sacrament al oath, each man says, in effect: ‘Lo!

CAN EVIDENCE BE DEPENDED UPON ? — EXAMINA - TION OF HUME’S REASONING. UR evidence for the truth of the Christian religion is less than the evidence for the truth of our senses; because, even in the first authors of our religion, it was no greater. It is evident it must diminish in passing from them t o their disciples; nor can any one rest such confidence in their testimony as in the immediate object of his senses.” This is wrong. The testimony of some men is more valid than is the evidence of the senses of some others. All depends upon the power o f the mind judging. “It is a general maxim, that no objects have any dis - coverable connection together. All the inferences which we can draw from one to another are founded merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction. It is evide nt that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony, whose connec - tion with any event seems in itself as little necessary as any other.” It may be.put to any person who carefully considers Hume’s previous position as to t he fixedness of the proofs of the senses, whether this last citation does not upset what he previously affirms. “ o"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"MIRACLES AND EXPERIENCE. 121 “The memory is tenacious to a certain degree. Men commonly have an inclination to truth and a principle of probity. They are sensible to shame when detected in a falsehood. These are qualities in human nature.” This is a mistake; for they are not qualities in human nature. They are the qualities of grown men, because they are reflective of the state of the man when he is living in community, —not as man. “Contrariety of evidence, in certain cases, may be derived from several different causes: from the opposition of con - trary testimony —from the character or number of the wit - nesses —from the manner of their delivering their testimony —or from the union of all these circumstances. We enter - tain a suspicion concerning any matter of fact when the witnesses contradict each other —when they are but few, or of a doubtful character -when they have an interest in what they affirm -when they deliver their te stimony with hesita - tion, or, on the contrary, with too violent asseverations. There are many other particulars of the same kind, which may diminish or destroy the force of any argument derived from human testimony.” Now, we contest these conclusions; and we will endea - vour to meet them with a direct overthrowing answer. The recognition of likelihood —not to say of truth —is intuitive, and does not depend on testimony. In fact, sometimes our belief goes in another direction than the testimony, though it be even to matters of fact. Hume resumes with his cool, logical statements: “The reason why we place any credit in witnesses and historians is not derived from any connection which we perceive à priori between testimony and reality, but because we are accust omed to find a conformity between them .” Just so! we would add to this, —“because we are accus - tomed to find a conformity between them.” We are now arrived at the grand dictum of cool -headed, self -possessed Hume, who thought that by dint of his logical cle arness, and by his definitions, he had exposed the impos - sibility of that unaccountable thing which men call a miracle,"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 122 and upon the possibility or the non - possibility of which religion will be ultimately found to wholly depend, because religion is entire ly opposed to laws of “must be” and “must not be.” “A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature ,” he declares. Not so, we will rejoin. It is only a violation of the laws of our nature. A very different thing. We have no right to set our nature up as the measure of all nature. This is merely the mind’s assumption; and it is important to expose its real emptiness, because all Hume’s philosophy turns upon this, which he imagines to be a rigid axiom, to which all argument must recur. “A firm and unalt erable experience has established the laws of nature. The proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from ex - perience can possibly be imagined.” So says Hume. But experience has nothing to do with a miracle, because it is a sense not comprised in the senses, but an unexperi - enced sensation or perception, exposing the senses as dreams, and overriding their supposed certainty and totality by a new dream, or apparent certainty, contradicting the preced - ing. If this were not possible, then the senses, or the instantaneous judgment which comes out of their sum — or the thing “conviction,” as we call it — would be the measure of everything past, present, and to come, — which we know it is not. Hume, or any philosopher, i s wrong in dogmatising at all, because he only speaks from his own experience; and individual experience will in no wise assist towards the discovery of real truth. In philosophy, no one has a right to lay down any basis, and to assume it as true. The p hilosopher must always argue negatively, not affirmatively. The moment he adopts the latter course, he is lost. Hume presupposes all his Treatise on Miracles in this single assumption that nature itself has laws, and not laws only to our faculties. The mighty difference between these two great facts will be at once felt by a thinker; but we will"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"IDEAS AND EMOTIONS. 123 not permit Hume to assume anything where he has no right, and so to turn the flank of his adversary by artfully putting forward unawares and carrying an assump tion. Nature is only nature in man’s mind, but not true otherwise, any more than that the universe exists out of the mind —or out of the man, who has in thinking to make it. Take away, therefore, the man in whom the idea of it is, and the universe disappea rs. We will question Hume, the dis - believing philosopher, as to his right to open his lips, because it is very doubtful if language, which is the power of expression, any more than that which we call consistent thought, is inseparably consistent to man, who is all incon - sistence in his beginning, middle, and end —in his coming here and in his going hence from here, out of this strange world; to which he does not seem really to belong, and in which world he seems to have been somehow obtruded, as something not of it —strange as this seems. As to the philosophy of Hume, granting the ground, you have, of course, all the basis for the constructions raised upon that ground. But suppose we, who argue in opposition to Hume, dispute his ground? Hume, in his Treatis e on Miracles , only begs the question; and there is therefore no wonder that, having first secured his position by consent or negligence of the opponent, he may deal from it the shot of what artillery he pleases; and his opponent, having once allowed the f irst ground, —or the capacity to argue, —has unwittingly let in all the ruinous results which follow; these philosophically are indisputable. We would urge that Hume has no capacity to argue in this way, inasmuch as he has taken the “human mind” as the capa city of arguing. Either reason or miracle must be first removed, because you can admit either; for they are op - posites, and cannot camp in the same mind: one is idea, the other is no idea —in this world; and as we are in this world, we can only judge as i n this world. In another world, Hume the philosopher may himself be an impossibility, and therefore be a miracle, through his own philosophy, and the application of it."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 124 Hume is the man of ideas, and is therefore very correct, as a philosopher, if philosop hy were possible; but we deny that it is possible in regard to any speculation out of this world. Ideas — that is, philosophical ideas — may be de - scribed as the steps of the ladder by which we philosophically descend from God. Emotions are also the steps b y which alone we can ascend to Him. Human reason is a possibility, from the line drawn by which either ascent or descent may be made. The things Necessity, or Fate, and Free Will, passing into the mind of man (both may be identical in their nature, thou gh opposite in their operation), dictate from the invisible, but persuade from the visible. Hume asserts that “a uniform experience amounts to a proof.” It does not do so, any more than “ninety - nine” are a “hundred.” He also says that “there is not to be found in all history any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men to be believed.” Now, we will rejoin to this, that a public miracle is a public impossibility; for the moment it has become public, it has ceased to be a miracle. “In the case of an y particular assumed miracle,” he further says, “there are not a sufficient number of men of such unquestioned good sense, education, and learning as to secure us against all delusion in themselves — of such undoubted integrity as to place them beyond all su spicion of any design to deceive others .” Now, to this our answer is, that our own senses deceive us; and why, then, should not the asseverations of others? Hume adduces a number of circumstances which, he insists, “are requisite to give us a full assura nce in the testimony of men;” but nothing can give us this assurance in other men's testimony that he supposes. We judge of circumstances ourselves, upon our own ideas of the testimony of men — not upon the testimony itself; for we sometimes believe that w hich the witnesses, with the fullest reliance upon themselves, deny. We judge upon our own silent convictions, — that is, upon all abstract points. It is for this reason that assurances even by angels, in Scrip - ture, have not been believed by the persons to whom the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"HUME’S INCREDULITY CONTESTED. 125 message was directly sent. Of course, if the miracle was displayed through the ordinary channels of human com - prehension, it was no miracle; for comprehension never has miracle in it. “The maxim by which we commonly conduct ourselves in our reasonings is, that the objects of which we have no experience resemble those of which we have,” says Hume. Now, this remark is most true; but we cannot help this persuasion. We conclude inevitably that things unknown should resemble things known, because , whatever maybe outside of our nature, we have no means of knowing it, or of discovering anything else that is other than our - selves. We can know nothing, except through our own machinery of sense. As God made outside and inside, God alone works, tho ugh we think that we —that is, Nature —work. God (who is Himself miracle) can effect impossi - bilities, and make two one by annihilating the distinction between them. Hume says that “where there is an opposition of argu - ments, we ought to give the preferenc e to such as are founded on the greatest number of past observations .” So we ought, if the world were real; but, as it is not, we ought not. Things unreal cannot make things real. Hume declares that “if the spirit of religion join itself to the love of w onder, there is an end of common sense. Human testimony, in these circumstances, loses all preten - sions to authority. A religionist may be an enthusiast, and imagine he sees what has no reality. He may know his narrative to be false, and yet persevere i n it with the best intentions in the world, for the sake of promoting so holy a cause. Even where this delusion has not taken place, vanity, excited by so strong a temptation, operates on him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any other circum - stances, and self -interest with equal force.

Their credulity increases his impudence, and his impudence overpowers their credulity.” Now, the reverse of all this is more nearly the fact. Ordinary m inds have more incredulity than credulity. It is quite a mistake to imagine that credulity is the quality of an ignorant mind; it is rather incredulity that is. “Eloquence, when at its highest pitch,” says Hume, “leaves little room for reason or reflecti on.” Now, on the contrary, true eloquence is the embodiment or synthesis of reason and reflection. “Eloquence,” resumes Hume, “addresses itself entirely to the fancy or the affections, captivates the willing hearers, and subdues their understanding. Happ ily, this pitch it seldom attains; but what a Tully or a Demosthenes could scarcely effect over a Roman or Athenian audience, every capuchin, every itinerant or stationary teacher, can perform over the generality of mankind, and in a higher degree, by touc hing such gross and vulgar passions.” All the above is simply superficial assumption. Hume then speaks of “forged miracles and prophecies;” but there is no proof of any forged miracle, or prophecy. He says that “there is a strong propensity in mankind to the extraordinary and the marvellous. There is no kind of report which rises so easily and spreads so quickly, especi - ally in country places and provincial towns, as those con - cerning marriages, insomuch that two young persons of equal condition never se e each other twice, but the whole neighbourhood immediately join them together.” This is all nonsense. There is always a reason for these suppositions. Hume then goes on to adduce this same love of inspiring curiosity and delight in wonders as the cause o f the belief in miracles. “Do not,” he asks, “the same passions, and others still stronger, incline the generality of mankind to believe and report, with the greatest vehemence and assurance, all reli - gious miracles?”"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"COMMON SENSE NOT ALL SENSE. 127 Now, this is only very poor; and, besi des, it is all assumption of truths where they are not.

He says that the y have been “trans - mitted with that inviolable sanction and authority which always attend received opinions.” But supernatural and miraculous relations have never been received opinions. They have always been contested, and have made their way against the common sense of mankind, because the common sense of mankind is common sense, and nothing more; and, in reality, common sense goes but a very little way, even in the common transactions of life; for feeling guides us in most matters. “All belief in the extraordinary,” Hume declares, “pro - ceeds from the usual propensity of mankind towards the marvellous, which only receives a check at intervals from sense and learning.” But what are sense and learning both but mere conceits? “ ‘It is strange,’ a judici ous reader is apt to say,” remarks Hume, “upon the perusal of these wonderful histories, ‘that such prodigious events never happen in our days.’ ” But such events do occur, we would rejoin; though they are never believed, and are always treated as fable, w hen occurring in their own time. “It is experience only,” says Hume, “which gives autho - rity to human testimony.” Now, it is not experience only which induces belief, but recognition. It is not ideas, but light. We do not go to the thing in ideas, but the thing comes into us, as it were: for instance, a man never finds that he is awake by experience, but by influx of the thing “waking” —whatever the act of waking is, or means. “When two kinds of experience are contrary, we have nothing to do but to subt ract the one from the other, and embrace an opinion either on one side or the other, with that assurance which arises from the remainder.”"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 128 This which follows may be a conclusion in regard to the above. If beliefs were sums, we should, and could, subtract the diiference between two amounts of evidence, and accept the product; but we cannot help our beliefs, because they are intuitions, and not statements. Hume, towards the close of his strictly hard and logical Treatise on Miracles, brings forward an argume nt, which to all appearance is very rigid and conclusive, out of this his realistic philosophy — if that were true : “Suppose that all the historians who treat of England should agree that on the ist of January 1600 Queen Eliza - beth died, — that both before a nd after her death she was seen by her physicians and the whole court, as is usual with persons of her rank, — that her successor was acknow - ledged and proclaimed by the parliament, — and that, after being interred a month, she again appeared, resumed the th rone, and governed England for three years. I must confess that I should be surprised at the concurrence of so many odd circumstances, but should not have the least inclination to believe so miraculous an event. I should not doubt of her pretended death, and of those other public circum - stances that followed it .” Now, in their own sequence, as they occur to us as real facts in the world, so unreal even are true, positive circum - stances, that we only believe them by the same means that we believe dreams — th at is, by intuition. There is no fact, so to say. Startling as it may appear, I appeal to the con - sciousness of those who have witnessed death whether the death itself did not seem unreal, and whether it did not remain without belief as a fact until the negative — that is, “The dead man is not here” — affirmed it, not through pre - sent persuasions, but through unreal incidents, post - dating reappearance.

His work is entitled Anthroposophia Theomagia; it has a supplemental treatise, called Anima magica Abscondita; we quote from pages 26 and 27 of the united volume: — “In regard of the Ashes of Vegetables ,” says Vaughan, “although their weaker exterior Elements expire by violence of the fire , yet their Earth cannot be destroyed , but is Vitri - fied .

The assertion is that the matrix or formative substance is, at the base, in all producti ons, “from mineral to man,” the same. “The germinal powers of the plant transmute the fixed air and the elementary base of water into grass or leaves; and on these the organific principle in the ox or the elephant exercises an alchemy still more stupendou s.

See also Herder’s Ideen , book v. cap. iii. We think that we have here shown the origin of all Professor Huxley’s speculations on this head appearing in his “Lectures,” and embodied in articles by him and others in scientific journals and elsewhere. In a lectu re delivered at the Royal Institution, Mr. W. S. Savory made the following remarks: “There is close relationship between the animal and the vegetable king - doms. The organic kingdom is connected with both by the process of crystallisation, which closely resembles some of the processes of vegetation and of the growth of the lower orders of animal creation.” The “Philosopher's Stone,” in one of its many senses may be taken to mean the magic mirror, or translucent"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 132 “spirit - seeing crystal,” in which things im possible to or - dinary ideas are disclosed. “Know,” says Synesius, “that the Quint essence” (five - essence) “and hidden thing of our ‘stone’ is nothing less than our celestial and glorious soul, drawn by our magistery out of its mine, which engenders itself and brings itself forth.” The term for “Chrystal,” or “Crystal,” in Greek, is the following; which may be divided into twin - or half - words in the way subjoined: CRUST | – | ALLOS . Crystal is a hard, transparent, colourless “stone,” com - posed of simple plates, giving fire with steel, not fermenting with acid menstrua , calcining in a strong fire, of a regular angular figure, supposed by some to be “formed of dew coagulated with nitre.” Amber is a solidified resinous gum, and is commonly full of electrici ty. It was supposed, in the hands of those gifted correspondingly, to abound with the means of magic. In this respect it resembles the thyrsus or pinecone, which was always carried in processions — Bacchanalian or otherwise — in connection with the mysteries . We can consider the name of the palace, or fortress, or “royal” house in Grenada, in Spain, in this respect following. The word “Alhambra,” or “Al - Hambra,” means the “Red.” In Arabia this means the place of eminence, the “place of places,” or the “Red, ” in the same acceptation that the sea between Arabia and Egypt is called the “Red Sea.” All spirits generally (in connection with those things supposed to be evil or indif - ferent especially) are “laid” in the “Red Sea,” when dis - posed of by exorcism, o r in forceful conjuration. We think that this “Hambra,” “ambra,” or “ambre,” is connected with the substance amber, which is sometimes very red, and which amber has always been associated with magical influence, magical formularies, and with spirits. We have seen an ancient crucifix, carved in amber, which was almost of the redness of coral.

While excavations were in progress at a mound in Orkney, described by Mr. John Stuart, Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, on July 18 th, 1861 , numerous lines of “runes” of various sizes were found on the walls and on the r oof of a large vaulted chamber in the earth. When the discoveries were completed, the series of runes exceeded 700 in number; figures of “ dragons and a cross ” were also cut on some of the slabs. There are many mounds of various forms and sizes in this pa rt of Orkney, and there is a celebrated circle of Druidical Stones on the narrow penin - sula which divides the two lochs of Stennis. Pliny says that the word “boa,” for a snake, comes from “bovine,” because “ young snakes are fed with cow’s milk .” Here we ha ve the unexpected and unexplained connection of the ideas of “snake” and “cow.” The whole subject is replete with mystery, as well as the interchange of the references to the “Cross” and the “Dragon” found in the insignia of all faiths, and lurking among st all religious buildings. On a Phœnician coin, found at Citium or Cyprus, and engraved in Higgins’s Celtic Druids , p. 117 , may be seen a cross and an animal resembling a hippocampus , both of which, or objects closely similar, appear on ancient sculp - tured stones in Scotland. The same two things, a cross and a strange -looking animal, half mammal, half fish or reptile, but called by Mr. Hodgson, of Newcastle -upon -Tyne, a Basilisk, appear together on a Mitliraic sculptured slab of the Roman period, found in the North of England.

A famous Logan - Stone, commonly cal led “Men - Amber,” is in the parish of Sethney, near Pendennis, Cornwall. It is 11 feet long, 4 feet deep, and 6 feet wide. From this the following derivatives may be safely made: Men - Amber, Mon - Amber, Mon - Ambra, Mon - Amrha, Mon - Amra (M’Om - Ra, Om - Ra), “Re d Stone,” or Magic, or Angelic, or Sacred Stone.

All the above signify an iden - tical myth. This we shall presently show conclusively, and connect them all with the worship of fire.

He calls the place “Burnt Pelham,” and he says: “In the wall of this Church lieth a most ancient Monument: A Stone wherein is figured a man, and about him an Eagle, a Lion, and a Bull, having all wings, and a fourth of the shape of an Angell, as if they should represent the four Evangelists: under the feet of the man is a crosse Flourie.” “The being represented cross -legged is not always a proof of the deceased having had the merit either of having been a crusader , or having made a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre.

The famous “Stone of Cabar,” Kaaba, Cabir, or Kebir, at Mecca, which is so devoutly kissed by the f aithful, is a talisman. It is called the “Tabernacle” (Taberna, or Shrine) of the Star Venus.” It is said that the figure of Venus is seen to this day engraved upon it, with a crescent.” The very Caaba itself was at first an idolatrous temple, whe re the Arabians wor - shipped “Al - Uza” — that is, Venus. See Bobovitis, Dr. Hyde Parker, and others, for particulars regarding the Arabian and Syrian Venus. She is the “Uraniæcorniculatæ sacrum” (Selden, De Venere Syriaca). The “Ihrâm is a sacred habit, whi ch consists only of two woollen wrappers; one closed about the middle of devotees, to cover,” &c., “and the other thrown over their shoulders.” Refer to observations about Noah, later in our book; Sale’s Discourse , p. 121 ; Pococke’s India in Greece , vol. ii. part i. p. 218 . The Temple of Venus at Cyprus was the Temple of Venus - Urania. “No woman entered this temple” (Sale’s Koran, chap. vii. p. 119 ; note, p. 149 ). Accordingly, Anna Com - mena and Glycas (in Renald. De Mah .) say that “the Mahometans do wors hip Venus.” Several of the Arabian idols were no more than large, rude stones (Sale’s Discourse , p. 20 ; Koran, chap. v. p. 82 ). The stone at Mecca is black . The crypts, the subterranean churches and chambers, the choirs, and the labyrinths, were all inte nded to enshrine (as it were) and to conceal the central object of worship, or this sacred “stone.” The pillar of Suerio, near Forres, in Scotland, is an obelisk.

Cambyses, in Egypt, left the obelisks or single mag ic stories. The Linghams in India were left untouched by the Mohammedan conquerors. The modern Romans have a phallus or lingha in front of almost all their churches. There is an obelisk, altered to suit Christian ideas (and surmounted in most instances in modern times by a cross), in front of every church in Rome. There are few churchyards in England without a phallus or obelisk. On the top is usually now fixed a dial. In former times, when the obeliscar form was adopted for ornaments of all sorts, it was one of the various kinds of Christian acceptable cross which was placed on the summit. We have the single stone of memorial surviving yet in the Fire -Towers (Round Towers of Ireland). This phallus, upright, or “pin of stone,” is found in every Gilga l or Druidical Circle. It is the boundary -stone or terminus , the parish mark -stone; it stands on every motehill; lastly (and chiefly), this stone survives in the stone in the corona - tion chair at Westminster (of which more hereafter), and also in the fam ous “London Stone,” or the palladium, in Cannon Street, City of London: which stone is said to be “London’s fate” —which we hope it is not to be in the unprosperous sense.

They were raised in the early religions, as the objects of a universal worship. All antiquaries know of what object the phallus stands as the symbolical representation. It needs not to be more particular here. The “ Fleur - de - Lis ” is a sacred symbol, descending from the Chaldæans, adopted by the Egyptians, who converted it into the deified “scarab” the emblem of the “Moon - god;” and it is perpetuated in that mystically magnificent badge of Fra nce, the female “Lily,” or “Lis.” All the proofs of this lie concealed in our Genealogy of the Fleur - de - Lis (p. 40 , pp. 182 , 183 , et seq.; also post), and the “Flowers - de - Luce,” or the “Fleurs de - Lis,” passim . It means “genera - tion,” or the vaunt realise d of the Turkish Soldan, “ Donec totum impleat orbem .” The “Prince of Wales’s Feathers” we believe to be, and to mean, the same thing as this sublime “Fleur - de - Lis.” It resembles the object closely, with certain effectual, ingenious disguises.

We think the following, which appears now for the first time, will prove this fact. Edward the Second, afterwards King of England, was the first Prince of Wales. There is reason to suppose that our valiant Edward the First, a monarch of extraordinary acquire - ments, was initiated into the knowledge of the abstruse Orientals. An old historian has the following: “On their giving” (i.e. the assembled Welsh) “a joyful and surprised assent to the King’s de mand, whether they would accept a king born really among them, and therefore a true Welsh - man, he presented to them his new -born son, exclaiming in broken Welsh, ‘Eich dyn!’ —that is, ‘This is your man!’ —which has been corrupted into the present motto to the Prince of Wales's crest, ‘Ich dien,’ or ‘I serve.’ ” The meaning of “I serve,” in this view, is, that “I” suffice, or “the Lis,” or “the act” suffices (p. 46 , and figures post ), for all the phenomena of the world.

O indicate God’s existence, the ancient sages of Asia, and many Greeks, adopted the emblem of pure fire, or ether. “Aërem amplecatur immensus æther, qui con - stat exaltissimis ignibus” (Cicero, De Natura Deorum , lib. ii. c. 36 ). “Cœlum ipsum stellasque colligens, omnisque siderum compago, æther vocatur, non ut quidem putant quod ignitus sit en insensus, sed quod cursibus rapidis semper rotatur” (Apulei us, De Mundo) . Pythagoras and Empedocles entertained similar theories (Brucker, 1 , c. i. p. 113 ). Parmenides also represents God as a universal fire which surrounded the heavens with its circle of light and fire (Cicero, De Natura Deorum , lib. iii. c. 2 ). Hippasus, Heraclitus, and Hippocrates imagined God as a reasoning and immortal fire which permeates all things (Cudworth, Systema Intellectuale , p. 104 ; and Gesnerus, De Animis Hippocratis ). Plato and Aristotle departed by little from this in their t eachings; and Democritus called God “the reason or soul in a sphere of fire” (Stobæus, Eclogæ Physicæ , lib. vii. c. 10 ). Cleonethes considered the sun as the highest god (Busching, Grundriss einer Geschichte dir Philosophie , 1 Th. p. 344 ). We find, there fore, in the earliest ages, an Æther (spiritual fire) theory, by which t"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 148 many modern theorists endeavour to explain the pheno - mena of magnetism. This is the “Ætheræum” of Robert Flood, the Rosicrucian. Fire, indeed, would appear to have been the chosen e lement of God. In the form of a flaming “bush” He appeared to Moses on Mount Sinai. His presence was denoted by torrents of flame, and in the form of fire He preceded the band of Israelites by night through the dreary wilderness; which is perhaps the ori gin of the present custom of the Arabians, “who always carry fire in front of their caravans” (Reade’s Veil of Isis ). All the early fathers held God the Creator to consist of a “subtile fire.” When the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles on the Day of Pentecost, it was in the form of a tongue of fire, accom - panied by a rushing wind. See Anacalypsis , vol. i. p. 627 (Parkhurst, in voce , grb ). The personality of Jehovah is, in Scripture, represented by the Material Trinity of Nature; which also, like t he divine antitype, is of one substance. The primal, scriptural type of the Father is Fire; of the Word , Light ; and of the Holy Ghost , Spirit , or Air in motion . This material Trinity, as a type, is similar to the material trinity of Plato; as a type, it is used to conceal the “Secret Trinity.” See Anacalypsis , vol. i. p. 627 . Holy fires, which were never suffered to die, were maintained in all the temples : of these were the fires in the Temple of the Gaditanean Hercules at Tyre, in the Temple of Vesta at Rome, among the Brachmans of India, among the Jews, and principally among the Persians. Now to prove that all “appearances” are “born of Fire,” so to speak, according to the ideas of the Rosicrucians. Light is not radiated from any intensely heated ga s or fluid. If nitre is melted, it will not be visible; but throw into it any solid body, and as soon as that becomes heated it will radiate light; hence the phenomenon, “Nasmyth’s willow - leaves,” in the sun, must be solid, not gaseous; and through their medium the whole of our light from the sun is doubtless derived.

These physical facts were known to the ancient Persians. The ancient ideas upon these subjects have not come down to us. at all definitely. The destruction of ancient manuscripts was effected upon a large scale. Diocletian has the credit of having burned the books of the Egyptians on the chemistry of gold and silver (alchemy). Cæsar is said to have burned as many as 700,000 rolls at Alexandria; and Leo Isaurus 300,000 at Constantinople in the eighth century, about the time that the Arabians burned the famous Alexandrian Library. Thus our knowledge of the real philosophy of th e ancient world is exceedingly limited; almost all the old records, or germinating means of know - ledge, being rooted out In regard to “Boudhisme, ou systeme mystique,” as he denominates it, a learned author describes it as —“Méta - physique visionnaire, qui , prenant à tache de contrarier l’ordre naturel, voulut que le monde palpable et matériel fût une illusion fantastique ; que Pexistence de Thomme fût un rêve dont la mort était le vrai réveil ; que son corps fut une prison impure dont il devait se hâter de sortir, ou une enve - loppe grossière que, pour la rendre perméable à la lumière interne, il devait atténuer, diaphaniser par le jeûne, les macérations, les contemplations, et par une foule de pra - tiques anachorétiques si estranges que le vulgaire étonné ne put s’expliquer le caractère de leurs auteurs qu’en les considérant comme des êtres surnaturels, avec cette diffi - culté de savoir s’ils furent Dieu devenu homme , ou l’homme devenu Dieu ”—Volney (C. F.), Les Ruines , p. 210 . “Mind cannot create, it can only perceive .” This hazard - ous statement, in its utmost extent, is used simply as an argument against there being the philosophical possibility of religion as derivable from reason only —which will be found to be the mere operation of the forces of the “world. ” No religion is philosophically capable of being defended on the grounds of reason; though one religion may seem (but, in the inner light, it will seem only) to be more reasonable (or"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 150 probable) than another. Divine light, or faith, or intuition, — in oth er words, the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit (to be recognised under its many names), — is that means alone which can carry truth, through the exposure of the futility of all knowable (that is, of all intellectual) truth. Such are the abstract notions of the Gnostics, or “Illuminati,” con - cerning religion. “The curtains of Yesterday drop down, the curtains of To - morrow roll up; but Yesterday and To - morrow both are” ( Sartor Resartus ., edit. 1838 , “Natural - Supernatural - ism,” p. 271 ). To the divine knowledge , the future must be as much present as the present itself. The explorations of the Rosicrucians may be said to be “as keys to masked doors in the ramparts of nature, which no mortal can pass through without rousing dread sentries never seen upon this sid e” ( A Strange Story , Lord Lytton, vol. i. p. 265 ). “Omnia ex Uno, Omnia in Uno, Omnia ad Unum, Omnia per Medium, et Omnia in Omnibus” ( Hermetic axiom ). In the speculations of the Gnostics, the astronomical points Cancer and Capricorn are called the “Gate s of the Sun.” Cancer, moreover, is - termed the \"Gate of Man;” Capricorn is the “Gate of the Gods.” These are Platonic views, as Macrobius declares. With the influences of the planets, Saturn brings reason and intelligence; Jupiter, power of action; Mars governs the irascible principle, the Sun produces sensation and speculation, Venus inspires the appetites, Mercury bestows the power of declaring and expressing, and the Moon confers the faculty of generating and augmenting the body. The Egyptian “winged disc” is a symbol of “Tat,” “Taut,” or “Thoth” (Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride ). The lions’ heads, so frequently observable in the sculptures decorating fountains, bespeak the astral influences under Leo, which produce the rains in the ardent month of J uly; and in this view they are regarded as the discharges of the “sacred fountains.” Lions’ heads, with fountains, are observable in architecture all the world over.

The seco nd, or horizontal, “mark” is the symbol of the tabernacle, chest, or ark, or fluent or base -line, which is the expression of all Egyptian, Grecian, and Jewish templar architecture. The union of the two lines gives the Christian, universal cross -form, in the blending of the “two dispensations” —Old and New, or “Law” and “Gospel.” Now, both of these lines, in the Rosicrucian sense, have special magic “powers,” or gifts, according to their several places, and according to the supernatural extra forces brough t specially to bear on them through the operations of those who know how (and when) to direct the occult power. Those powers bestowed upon the original deserving “Man,” and not extinguished in the existing “Man,” are his still —if he retain any glimpse of his original spark of light. Justinus Kerner, in his Scherin von Prevorst , most inge - niously anatomises the inner man, and makes him consist of “seele,” “nerven -geist,” and “geist.” The “nerven - geist,” or nervous energy, being of a grosser nature, con - tinues united with the “seele” on its separation from the body, rendering it visible in the form of an apparition, and enabling it to affect material objects, make noises, move articles, and such -like things perceptible to the living sense —in short, to “s pucken.” According to its nature, this composite being takes a longer or shorter time to be dis - solved; the “geist” alone being immortal ( The Gnostics and their Remains , note to p. 46 ). An Ancient Homily on Trinity Sunday has the following: “At the deth of a manne, three bells should be ronge as his knyll in worship of the Trinitie. And for a woman, * who was the Second Person of the Trinitie, two bells should * This is a curious direct assertion that the Saviour of the World was feminine."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 152 be ronge.” Here we have the source of the emblematic difficulty among the master - masons, who constructed the earlier cathedrals, as to the addition and as to the precise value of the second (or feminine) tower at the western end (or Galilee) of a church. Valentinus is called the “profoundest doctor of the Gnosis.” According to him, the “Eons” (an gels, or effu - sions) number fifteen pairs, which represent the thirty degrees of each sign of the zodiac. The name of the great Gnostic deity, Abraxas, is derived as follows: “Ab,” or “Af” (“Let it be”); “Rax,” or “Rak” (“Adore”); ”Sas,”or “Sax,” for “Sadshi” (“Name”). “The entire Gnostic system was not derived either from the Kabala, or from the Grecian philosophy, but from the East, as Mos - heim long ago maintained:” so declares the author of The Gnostics and their Remains; but it is a thorough mist ake, both in his authority (Mosheim), and also in himself. We shall successfully show this before we have done. As soon as Jesus was born, according to the Gnostic speculative view of Christianity, Christos, uniting himself with Sophia (Holy Wisdom), desc ended through the seven planetary regions, assuming in each an analogous form to the region, and concealing his true nature from its genii, whilst he attracted into himself the sparks of Divine Light they severally retained in their angelic essence. Thus Christos, having passed through the seven Angelic Regions before the “ T HRONE ,” entered into the man Jesus, at the moment of his baptism in the Jordan. * From that time forth, being supernaturally gifted, Jesus began to work miracles. Before that, he ha d been completely igno - rant of his mission. When on the cross, Christos and Sophia left his body, and returned to their own sphere. Upon his death, the two took the man “Jesus,” and aban - doned his material body to the earth; for the Gnostics held * “At the moment of his baptism in the Jordan” — mark. Up to that point he was natural — but not the “Christ.” This will recall his exclamation of world’s discla imer to the Virgin — “Woman, what have I to do with thee?”"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"TRADITIONARY FACTS AT THE CRUCIFIXION. 153 that the true Jesus did not (and could not) physically suffer on the cross and die, but that Simon of Cyrene, who bore his cross, did in reality suffer in his room: “And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of A lexander and Rufus, to bear his cross” (St. Mark xv. 21 ). The Gnostics contended that a portion of the real history of the Crucifixion was never written. Asserting that a miraculous substitution of persons took place in the great final act of the “Crucif ixion,” the Gnostics maintained that the “Son of God” could not suffer physi - cally upon the cross, the apparent sufferer being human only —real body having no part with him. At the point of the miraculous transference of persons, Christos and Sophia (the Divine) left his body, and returned to their own heaven. Upon his death on earth, the two withdrew the “Being” Jesus (spiritually), and gave him another body, made up of ether (Rosicrucian Ætheræu m ). Thenceforward he consisted of the two first Rosicrucia n principles only, soul and spirit; which was the cause that the disciples did not recognise him after the resurrection. During his sojourn upon earth of eighteen months after he had risen, he received from Sophia ( Soph , Suph ), or Holy Wisdom, that perfec t knowledge or illumination, that true “Gnosis,” which he communicated to the small number of the Apostles who were capable of receiving the same. The Gnostic authorities are St. Irenaeus in the first place, Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, St. Ep iphanius.

The reason is, that the speech of an angel or of a spirit flows first into the man’s thought, and, by an internal way, into his organ of hearing, and thus actuates it from within; whereas the speech of man flows first into the air, and, by an external way, into his organ of hearing, which it actuates from without . Hence it is evident that the speech of an angel and of a spirit with man is heard in man, and, since it equally affects the organs of hearing, that it is equally sonorous (Swedenborg; also Occult Sciences , p. 93 ; London, 1855 ). The Greek Bacch anals were well acquainted with the mythos of Eve, since they constantly invoked her, or a person under her name, in their ceremonies. Black is the Saturnian colour — also that of the Egyptian Isis. Under the strange head of the embodiment of Deity under da rkness, the following remarkable facts may be considered : the Virgin and Child are depicted black at the Cathedral at Moulins, at the famous Chapel of the Virgin at Loretto, in the Church of the Annunciation at Rome, at the Church of St. Lazaro and the Ch urch of St. Stephen at Genoa, at that of St. Francisco at Pisa, at the Church of Brixen in the Tyrol, at a church in (and at the Cathedral of) Augsburgh, where the black figures are as large as life, at the Borghese Chapel in Rome, at the Church of Santa M aria Maggiore in the Pantheon, and in a small chapel at St. Peter’s, on the right - hand side, on entering, near the door. The reader can make references in his memory to these places, if he be a traveller. The writer, who goes by the name of Dionysius Areo pa - gita, teaches that the highest spiritual truth is revealed only to those who have transcended every ascent of every holy height, and have left behind all divine lights and sounds and heavenly discoursings, and have passed into that Dark - ness where H E r eally is (as saith the Scripture) who is A LL , above all things ( De Mystica Theologia , cap. i. sec. 3 ;"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"EPHESIAN DIANA. 155 Hours with the Mystics , vol. i. note to book i. chap. 2 , by R.

Our great King Edward the Third picked - up, with the famous words of the motto of t he Order of the Garter, the “garter” — or, as we interpret it, by adding a new construc - tion with hidden meanings, the “Garder” (or special cestus, shall we call it?) — of the beautiful and celebrated Countess of Salisbury, with whom, it is supposed, King Edw ard was in love. The following is from Elias Ashmole: “The Order of the Garter by its motto seems to challenge inquiry and defy reproach. Everybody must know the story that refers the origin of the name to a piece of gallantry: either the Queen or the Co untess of Salisbury having been supposed to have dropped one of those very useful pieces of female attire at a dance; upon which old Camden says, with a great deal of propriety, and a most just compliment to the ladies, ‘ Hæc vulgus perhibit, nec vilis sa ne hæc videatur origo, cum NOBILITAS sub AMORE jacet .’ The ensign of the order, in jewelry or enamel, was worn originally on the left arm. Being in the form of a bracelet to the arm, it might possibly divert the attention of the men from the reputed ori ginal; it might be dropped and resumed without confusion; and the only objection I can see to the use of such an ornament is the hazard of mistake from the double meaning of the term periscelis , cells, which signifies not only a garter, but breeches , whic h our English ladies never wear: ‘Quæ Graeci periscelÁ vocant, nostri Braccas’ (braces or breeches) ‘dicunt,’ says an ancient Father of the Church.” The Garter, to judge thus from Camden, was not a garter at all for the leg, but an occasional very impor tant item of feminine under - attire; and King Edward’s knightly feeling, and the religious devo - * See post , and through Chapter the Thirtieth, for particular facts — very important in the authentic history of the “Garter.”"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"ORIGIN OF THE ORDER OF THE “ GARTER. ” 159 tion of the object, will be perceived upon close and delicately respectful consideration. There is great obscurity as to the character of Abraxas, the divinity of the Gnostics. The Eons, or Degrees of Advance in the Zodiacal Circle, are thirty in number to each of the Twelve Signs, and consequently there are 360 to the entire Astronomical Circle, or 365 , counting for each day of the solar year.

There were two great ord eals —by water, and by fire. The one is the occult trial —baptism by water, in the sinister or left -handed sense, applied to those suspected of witchcraft. The other (more perfect and more perfecting) baptism is by symbolical fire. Both rites were in use a mong the Egyptians. (Refer to mystic heraldic formul æ elsewhere in our book.) The three ordeals (or sacraments) of the Ancient Mysteries were by “Water, Air, and Fire.” Thus, also, the Egyptian Initiation: “Cave, Cloud, Fire.” So, too, the Masonic Initi ations. With these meanings, royal coffins and investi - tures are always red (Mars), as meaning “royalty active;” or imperial purple (Jupiter, or perhaps Mercurius —Thoth, Taut, Tat), as “royalty passive,” or implying the “lord of regions.” According to th e cabalistic view, “Jacob’s Ladder,” which was disclosed to him in a vision, is a metaphorical representation of the powers of alchemy, operating through visible nature. The “Ladder” was a “Rainbow,” or pris - matic staircase, set up between earth and heav en. Jacob's Dream implied a history of the whole hermetic creation.

The first is the animal, material, gross fire, with which we are familiar, contained in a celestial, unparticled, and surrounding medium (or celestial fire), which is its matrix , and of which, in this human body, we can no no thing. In 1867 , in Paris, a suggestive philosophical book was published, under the title of Hébreu Primitif; Formation des Lettres, ou Chiffres, Signes du Zodiaque et Racines Hebraiques, avec leurs Derives dans les Langues de l’Orient et de l’Europe , par Ad.

In early ages the Egypt ians worshipped this highest being under the name of Athor. He was the lord of the universe. The Greeks transformed Athor into Venus, who was looked upon by them in the same light as Athor (Apuleius, Cicero, Ovid; Ptolemæus, in tetrabibla ; Proclus; Ennem oser, vol. i. p. 268 , trans, by Howitt). Among the Egyptians, Athor also signified the night (Hesiod, Orpheus). “According to the Egyptians,” says Jablonski, “matter has always been con - nected with the mind. The Egyptian priests also main - tained that t he gods appeared to man, and that spirits communicated with the human race.” “The souls of men are, according to the oldest Egyptian doctrine, formed of ether, and at death return again to it.” The alchemists were a physical branch of the Rosicru - cians. The more celebrated authors (and authorities) upon the art and mystery of alchemy are Hermes (whose seven chapters and “smaragdine table,” as it is called, contain the whole alchemical system); Geber, the “ Turba ,” “ Rosary ,” Theatrum Chemicum , Bibliothèque Hermétique , Chymical Cabinet; Artephius, Arnoldus de Villa Nova, Raimondus Lullius, Trevisan, Nicholas Flamel, Zachareus, Basilius Valentinus, Cosmopolita, and Philalethes (Thomas Vaughan). Refer also to The Hermetical Triumph, or the Victorious Philosop her’s Stone: London, 1723 ; Lucas’s Travels , p. 79 ; Count Bernard of Treviso. Two leading works, however, on the hermetic subject are La Chiave del Gabinetto * Col. 1681 , 12 mo, by Joseph Francis Borri, an Italian; and Le Compte de Gabalis, ou Entretiens su r les Sciences Secretes; imprimée à Paris, par Claude Barbin, 1671 , 12 mo, pp. 150 .

At the supposed revival of Rosicrucianism in Paris, in March 1623 , the Brethren were said to number thirty -six; of whom there were six in Paris, six in Italy, six in Spain, twelve in Germany, four in Sweden, and two in Switzerland. In 1616, the famous English Rosicrucian, Robertas de Fluctibus (Robert Fludd), published his defence of the society, under the titl e, Apologia Compen - diaria, Praternitatem de Rosea -Cruce, Suspitionis et Infamies maculis aspersam abluens , published in 1616 at Frankfort. Since this time, there has been no authentic account of the Rosicrucians. We are now the first translators of Robert Fludd. “Amongst an innumerable multitude of images and symbolical figures, with which the walls” — i.e. , those of the caverns of initiation at Salsette —“are covered, the Linga or Phallus was everywhere conspicuous, often alone, some - times united with the p etal and calyx of the lotus, the point within the circle, and the intersection of two equilateral triangles” (Dr. Oliver, History of Initiation . See also Maurice on the Indian Initiations .) The Linga, or pillar, or stone of memorial, in its material form, is the perpetuation of the idea of the male generative principle, as the physical means, in conjunction with the Yoni (loni), or discus , of the production of all visible things. In this connection, the addition to the name of Simon Peter (Petra, or Pietra , Cephas. Jonas, Bar -Jonas, lonas) will be recalled as suggestive. There is a sacred stone in every Temple in India. The Stone, or Pillar, or “Pillow,” of Jacob was sacred among the Jews. It was anointed with oil. There was a sacred stone among the Gre eks at Delphi, which was also anointed with oil in the mystic ceremonies. The stone of Caaba, or black stone at Mecca, is stated to have been there long before the time of Mohammed. It was preserved by him when he destroyed the dove and images.

No. 2 is evi - dently the “Crux -Ansata,” combining the indications of “Lotus” and “Lily.” Here is a union of the cl assic, the Judaic, and Gothic forms, all presenting the same idea at once. Buddha was the sun in “Taurus;” Cristna (Crishna, Krishna) was the sun in “Aries.” In regard to the origin of speech, of writing, and of letters, it may be remarked that the Egypti ans referred the employment of a written symbol (to record and communi - cate the spoken word) to a Thoth; the Jews, to Seth or his children (Josephus, Ant . i, 2 , 3 ); the Greeks, to Hermes. But “Thout” in Coptic (Pezron, Lexicon Lingua. Copticæ s. voc . Ge n xix. 26 in the Coptic version), also tc in Hebrew, and ` ErmÁj (Hermes) in Greek, are all names for a pillar or post.

Dupuis was (see his learned memoir concerning the origin of the constellations), that “Libra” was formerly the sign of the vernal equinox, and “Aries” of the nocturnal, autumnal equinox; that is, that since the origin of the actual astronomical system, the procession (precession?) of the equinoxes had carried forward by seven signs the primitive order of the zodiac. Now, estimating the procession (precession?) at about 70 ½ years to a degree , —that is, 2115 years to each sign, -and observing that “Aries” was in its fifteenth degree 1447 before Christ, it follows that the first degree of “Libra” could not have coincided with the vernal equinox more lately than 15,194 years before Christ, to which, if you add 1790 years since Christ, it appears that 16,984 years have elapsed since the origin of the “Zodiac” (Volne y, Ruins of Empires , 1 st English edition, 1792 , p. 360 ). All white things express the celestial and luminous gods; all circular ones, the world, the moon, the sun, the destinies; all Semicircular ones, as arches and crescents, are descriptive of the moon, and of lunar deities and meanings. “The Egyptians,” says Porphyry, “employ every year a talisman in remembrance of the world.

There are seven planets in the solar system. These seven planets are signified in the seven - branched candlestick of the Jewish ritual. The number is a sacred number. These seven “prophets,” or angels, have each twelve apostles, places, stella , “stalls,” or regions or dominions (stalls as “stables”), for the exercise of their powers. The se are the twelve divisions of the great Circle, or the twelve signs of the Zodiac. All this is Cabalistic, Magical, Sabaistical, and Astrological. The name Ashtaroth or Astarte has been derived from Ashre , aster , ast , star, or “starred;” in the same way as the word Sephi - roth comes from the Hebrew root, “roth.” On the black sacred stone (“Kebla,” or “Cabar”) at Mecca, “there appears the figure of a human head cut,” “which some take to be the head of a Venus” (Enthumius Zyabenus, Mod.

Here we have the object of adoration of the Ophites — the female generative power — the Destroy ing, Regenerating Power among the Ophites, and, indeed, the Gnostics generally.

Here again we recognise, under another name (Ophites), the Cyclopes, or the builders of the circular Temples at Stonehenge and everywhere else. Mr. Payne Knight has repeated an observation of Stukeley, that “the original name of the temple at Abury was the ‘Snake’s Head.’ ” And he adds, “It is remarkable that the remains of a similar circle of stones (circular temple) in Bœotia had the same name in the time of Pausanias (Pau - sanias, Bœot . cap. xix. s. 2 ).

From thence it was brought into Ireland by Simon Brech, the first King of the Scots, about 700 years before Christ; and from there, about 370 years after, into Scotland, by King Fergaze (Fergus). In the year of Christ 850 it was placed at the Abbey of Scone (in the county of Perth) by King Kenneth; this being the place where the Scottish Kings were generally crowned in those days. In the year 1297 this Scottish wooden throne or chair, together with their crown and sceptre, was br ought into England by the English King Edward the First, and placed in Westminster Abbey. “Si quid habent veri vel chronica, cana fidesve, Clauditur hac Cathedra nobilius ecce lapis, Ad caput eximius Jacob quondam Patriarcha Quem posuit, cernens minima mi rapoli.

The supposed magical stone, enclosed in the wooden block at the base of the Coron ation Chair, has been reputed, from time immemorial, to murmur its approval or disap - proval of the royal occupant, only at the moment when the Sovereign was placed in the chair for investiture with the sacred pallium or with the state robes, on the occasio n of the King’s or the Queen’s coronation. In this respect the stone is very similar in its ascribed supernatural gifts, and in this special oracular speaking - power, to all sacred or magical stones; and more particu - larly to the famous statue of Memnon in Egypt, which is said to give forth a long, melodious tone with the first ray of sunrise, like that produced by the wind through the Æolian harp. It is not quite clear whether this sound is expected to issue from the stone in .the royal chair at Westminste r when approval is intended, and the meaning of the stone is benign, or whether sounds at all are to be heard only when displeasure is to be expressed. This strange asserted power of the sacred stone at Westminster to become vocal directly allies it with other oracular stones all over the world.

E beg to premise that the following f ears are not our belief, but that they are educed from old traditions — old as England. It is a very ancient idea, derived from the highest antiquity, that the colour “white” — which, con - sidered in the mystic and occult sense, is feminine in its origin — is fateful in its effects sometimes; and that, as a particular instance of its unfortunate character, it is an unlucky colour for the royal house of England — at all events, for the king or queen of England personally — singular as the notion would appear to b e. We are not aware whether this sinister effct of the ominous colour white is supposed to extend to the nation generally. It is limited, we believe, to the prince or sovereign of England, and to his immediate belongings. The name John, which comes fro m Iona , a remote feminine root, has also been reckoned unfortunate from the king’s name both in England and in France. The reason of this does not appear to be anywhere stated. The origin of the prophecy, also, as to the formidable character of the colo ur white to England is unknown; but it is imaginged to be at least as old as the w"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 178 time of Merlin. Thomas de Quincey, who takes notice of the prophecy of the “White King,” says of King Charles the First, that the foreboding of the misfortunes of this “Whit e King” were supposed to have been fulfilled in his instance, because he was by accident clothed in white at his coronation; it being remembered afterwards that white was the ancient colour for a victim. This, in itself, was sufficiently formidable an om en. De Quincey’s particular expressions are, “That when King Charles the First came to be crowned, it was found that, by some oversight, all the store in London was insufficient to furnish the purple velvet necessary for the robes of the king and for th e furniture of the throne. It was too late to send to Genoa for a supply; and through this accidental deficiency it happened that the king was attired in white velvet at the solemnity of his coronation, and not in red or purple robes, as consisted with t he proper usage.” As an earlier instance of this singular superstition, the story of that ill - fated royal White Ship occurs to memory, as the vessel was called wherein Prince William, the son of King Henry the First, the heir - apparent, with his natural si ster, the Countess of Perche, and a large company of the young nobility, embarked on their return to England from Normandy. It might be supposed that the misfortunes of King Charles the First, which were accepted, at that time of monarchical dismay, as th e reading (and the exhaustion) of this evil - boding prophecy, were enough; but there are some reasons for imagining that the effects are not — even in our day — altogether expended. The fatalities of the colour “white” to English royalty certainly found their consummation, or seemed so to do, in the execution of King Charles the First, who was brought out to suffer before his own palace of “Whitehall” — where, again, we find “white” introduced in connection with royalty and tragical events. Whitehall is the Roya l “White” Palace of England. The “White Rose” was the unfortunate rose (and the conquered one) of the contending two Roses in this country. This is again a singular fact, little as it has"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"WHITE A MAGIC COLOUR. 179 been remarked. We will pursue this strange inquiry just a littl e further, and see if the lights of Rosicrucianism will not afford us a measure of help; for it is one of the doctrines of the Rosicrucians that the signatures, as they call them, of objects have a magical marking -up and a pre - ternatural effect, through hi dden spiritual reasons, of which we have no idea in this mortal state, —in other words, that magic and charming, through talismans, is possible; com - mon sense being not all sense. The colour white is esteemed both of good and of bad augury, according to the circumstances and the periods of its presentation. However (to speak a few strange words), in relation to the use of the name “Albert Edward,” in a possible future time, which every loyal subject will hope to be remote enough, we would advise (supposing so humble a voice as ours should reach, or could attain, to the quarters where such a change might be effected) a variation of our future king’s name, and an avoidance of this supposedly unfortunate prefix “Albert” in favour of “Edward” only. This name of Edward is an historical, triumphant, and auspicious name; for all our Edwards, except the weak King Edward the Second, have been powerful or noteworthy men. Now, very few people have had occasion to remark, or have recalled the fact as signi - ficant an d ominous in the way we mean, that the word “Albert” itself means “White.” The root of “Albert” is, in most languages, to be found in “white:” albus , white; alp , white; Albania , the “white” country. We here recall the “ snowy camese,” to which Byron make s reference as worn in Alb ania. “Albion” (of the “white” cliffs), Alb, Al, El, Æl, all mean “white.” Examples might be multiplied. Alfoj , alsi , albus, “white,” are derived from the Celtic alp; and from thence came the word “Alps,” which are mountains always white, as being covered with snow. “ Albus ,” white, certainly comes from the Celtic alp , or alb ,” says the historian Pezron; “for in that language, as well as in many others, the b and the p frequently interchange; from whence the ancient Latins, a nd the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 180 Sabines themselves, said Alpus for white. I consider it therefore as certain,” continues Pezron, “that from Alpus the word Alps came, because the mountains are always white, as being covered with snow; the words ‘Alp’ or ‘Alb,’ and their compounds, meaning white everywhere. I conclude, also, that from the Pen of the Celtæ, Umbrians, and Sabines, which signifies a ‘head,’ ‘top,’ or ‘high place,’ they made Penninus Mons, the Apennines, vast mountains in Italy. Thus these celebrated words proceed cer tainly from the Gaulish tongue, and are older by several ages than the city of Rome.” The following are all Teutonic or German words: alb , alf (Qy. Alfred?), and alp , — which all signify “white,” as their original root. Thus much for white. White is also a colour not auspicious to the Prussian royal family, although, again, in a contradictory way, the ensigns of Prussia (Borussia, or “of the Borussi”) are, as armorists well know, the original “white and black” of the Egyp - tians, which were adopted by the Teutons and the Templars. These white and black tinctures are heraldically argent and sable: Luna, or pearl , for “tears;” Saturn, or diamond, for “sadness, penance, and ashes.” In these strange senses, the Rosicrucians accepted colours as in themselves talis - manic, powerfully operative through their planetary “effi - cients,” or “signatures,” as the astrologers call them. These ideas, more or less pronounced, have prevailed in all ages and in all countries, and they lurk largely in suspicion through our own land. We are all aware, in England, of the objection to the colour “green” in certain cases. It is the spirit - colour, a magic colour, the colour of the “fairies,” as the cabalistic, tutelary, miniature spirits are called, who are supposed to be ver y jealous of its use. In Ireland, green is universally regarded with distrust; but with veneration, in the spiritual sense. It is the national colour; for the Patroness of Ireland is the female deity, the Mother of Nature, known in the classic mythology as Venus, — equally Venus the graceful and Venus the terrible, as the Goddess of Life and of Death.

Her hair, in the moment of agony, streams Daphne -like, as “when about to be transformed into the tree,” behind her in the wind, and twines, in the mortal, mythical stress, into the seven strings of the ma gic Irish Harp, whose music is the music of the spheres, or of the Rosicrucian, assumed penitential, visible world. These seven strings stand for the seven vowels, by means of which came speech to man, when the “new being,” man (this is cabalistic again, and therefore difficult of comprehension), “opened his mouth and spake.” The seven strings of the Irish Harp, it will be remembered, are blazoned “Luna,” or the “Moon” —the feminine moon —according to the practice of the old heralds, in regard to all royal or ruling achievements, which are blazoned by the names of the planets. The seven strings of the Irish harp mean also the seven pure tones in music; these, again, stand for the seven prismatic colours; which, again, describe the seven vowels; and these, a gain, represent their seven rulers, or the seven planets, which have their seven spirits, or “Celestial Flames,” which are the seven Angels or Spirits of God, who keep the way round about “the Throne of the Ancient of Days.” There is in most countries an o bjection to Friday, although it is the Mohammedan sacred day or Sabbath.

Friday is the “woman's day” of the sevenfold weekly period; and therefore, as some ill - natured people might say, it is the unlucky day. Certain it is, however, that altho ugh it presents the exact contradic - tion of being especially the woman's day, few or no mar - riages would be celebrated on this day, as popularly bearing the mark of ill - luck, which supposition few would like openly to defy, or, according to the familiar e xpression, “fly in the face of.” May is also forbidden for marriages, although it days. The Hermetic Brethren had certain rules that they observed in relation to this view of the power of precious stones to bring go od or bad fortune through the planetary affinities of certain days, because they imagined that the various gems, equally as gold and silver, were produced through the chemic operation of the planets, working secretly in the telluric body. They thought tha t gold and silver, and all the gems, had but one foundation in nature, and were simply augmented, purified, and perfected through the operation of the hermetic or mag - netic light — invisible and unattainable under ordinary circumstances, and unknown, except to the alchemists. All yellow gems, and gold, are appropriate to be worn on Sunday, to draw down the propitious influences, or to avert the antagonistic effects, of the spirits on this day, through its ruler and name - giver, the Sun. On Monday, pearls and white stones (but not diamonds) are to be worn, because this is the day of the Moon, or of the second power in nature. Tuesday, which is the day of Mars, claims rubies, and all stones of a fiery lustre. Wednesday is the day for turquoises, sapphires, an d all precious stones which seem to reflect the blue of the vault of heaven, and that imply the lucent azure of the supposed spiritual atmosphere, wherein, or under which, the Rosicrucian sylphs dwell — those elementary children who, according to the cabalis tic theogony, are always striving for inter - course with the race of Adam, seeking a share of his particular privilege of immortality, which has been denied to them. Thursday demands amethysts and deep - coloured stones of sanguine tint, because Thursday is the day of Thor — the Runic impersonated Male Divine Sacrifice. Friday, which is the day of Venus, has its appropriate emeralds, and reigns over all the varieties of the imperial, and yet strangely the sinister, colour green. Saturday, which is Saturn's da y, the oldest of the gods, claims for its distinctive talisman the most splendid of all gems, or the queen of precious stones, the lustre - darting diamond, which is produced from the black of Sab, Seb, or Saturn, the origin of all visible things, or the “Gr eat Deep,” or “Great Mother,” in one sense."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"THE WHITE LADY OF BERLIN. 183 is the “woman's month, ” or month in which “May -day ” occurs, and in which “May -poles ” used to be set up every - where.

But to return to the ill -omened colour to England, white, and to the important (in t his sense, formidable) shape in which we find it to appear in the name borne by our Prince of Wales —“Albert Edward; ” inheriting his name “Albert ” from perhaps the most l ovable prince whom this country has ever known as casting in his destinies, by marriage, with it, but whose end —in the pr ime of life, and in the fulness of his influence —was sure ly unfortunate enough, when the eyes of hope of all Europe, in various respect s, were fixed upon him !

Mystic rites, and the sym - bolical lights, which mean the Divinity of Fire, abound at Candlemas -day (February 2 d), or the Feast of the Purifi - cation; in the torches borne at weddings, and in the typical flame -brandishing at marriage over almost all the world; in the illumina tions at feasts; in the lights on, and set about, the Christian altar; at the festival of the Holy Nativity; in the ceremonies at preliminary espousals; in the Bale, or Baal, fires on the summits of the mountains; in the watch - lights, or votive sanctuary -lights, in the hermitage in the lowest valley; in the chapelle ardente in the Romish funereal observances, with its abundance of silent, touching lights around the splendid catafalque , or twinkling, pale and ineffectual, singly at the side of the death -bed in the cottage of the peasant. Starry lights and innumerable torches at the stately funeral, or at any pompous celebration, mean the same. In short, light all over the world, when applied to religious rites, and to ceremonial, whether in the ancient or in the modern times, bespeaks the same origin, and struggles to express the same meaning, which is Parseeism, Perseism, or the worship of the deified F IRE , disguised in many theological or theosophic forms. It will, we trust, never be supposed that we m ean, in this, real fire but only the inexpressible something of which real fire, or rather its flower or glory (bright light), is the farthest off —because, in being visible at all, it is the grossest and most inadequate image."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 188 All this strange, dreamy, eth ereal view of a vital, acces - sible something, entirely separate from the suggestions of mere sensation, is Gnosticism, or Bhuddism, in its own profoundest depth. It follows on similarly to the “intoxi - cation,” or suffusion with the very certainty of the presence of God, which, in the poetic sense, was said to fill the mind of even the supposed arch - atheist Spinoza. The Rosicrucians, through the revelations concerning them of their celebrated English representative, Robertus de Fluctibus, or Robert Fludd, declare, in accordance with the Mosaic account of creation, - which, they maintain, is in no instance to be taken literally, but metaphorically, — that two original principles, in the beginning, proceeded from the Divine Father. These are Light and Darkness, — or form or idea, and matter or plasticity. Matter, down - wards, becomes fivefold, as it works in its forms, according to the various operations of the first informing light; it extends four - square, according to the points of the celestial compass, with t he divine creative effluence in the centre. The worlds spiritual and temporal, being rendered subject to the operation of the original Type, or Idea, became, in their imitation of this Invisible Ideal, first intelligible, and then endowed with reciprocal meaning outwards from them - selves. This produced the being (or thought) to whom, or to which, creation was disclosed. This is properly the “Son,” or Second Ineffable Person of the Divine Trinity. Thus that which we understand as a “human mind” be - came a possibility.

This power, or vigour, uniting with the Ethereal Spirit, constitutes strictly the “Soul of the World.” It becomes the only means of the earthly intelligence, or man, knowing it. It is the Angel -Conqueror, Guide, Saviour born of “Woman,” or “Great Deep,” the Gnostic Sophia, the “Word made flesh” of St. John. The Emp yrseum is properly the flower, or glory (effluent in its abundance), of the divine Latent Fire. It is penetrated with miracle and holy magic. The Rosicrucian system teaches that there are three ascending hierarchies of beneficent Angels (the purer portio n of the First Fire, or Light), divided into nine orders. These threefold angelic hierarchies are the Teraphim, the Sera - phim, and the Cherubim. This religion, which is the religion of the Parsees, teaches that, on the Dark Side, there are also three counterbalancing resultant divisions of operative intelligences, divided again into nine spheres, or inimical regions, populated with splendidly endowed adverse angels, who boast still the relics of their lost, or eclipsed, or changed, light. The elementary world, or lowest world, in which man and his belongings, and the lower creatures, are produced, is the flux, subsidence, residuum, ashes, or deposit, of the Ethereal Fire. Man is the microcosm, or “indescribably small copy,” of the whole gr eat world. Dilatation and compression, expansion and contraction, magnetic sympathy, gravitation -to, or flight -from, is the bond which holds all imaginable things together.

The Rosicrucians held that, all things visible and in - visible having been produced by the contention of light with darkness, the earth has denseness in its inn umerable heavy concomitants downwards, and they contain less and less of the original divine light as they thicken and solidify the grosser and heavier in matter. They taught, neverthe - less, that every object, however stifled or delayed in its operation, and darkened and thickened in the solid black - ness at the base, yet contains a certain possible deposit, or jewel, of light, — which light, although by natural process it may take ages to evolve, as light will tend at last by its own native, irresistible f orce upward (when it has oppor - tunity), can be liberated; that dead matter will yield this spirit in a space more or less expeditious by the art of the alchemist.

Thus all minerals, in this spark of light, have the rudimentary possibility of plants and growi ng organisms ; thus all plants have rudimentary sensitives, which might (in the ages) enable them to perfect and transmute into locomotive new creatures, lesser or higher in their grade, or nobler or meaner in their functions; thus all plants and all veget ation might pass off (by side - roads) into more distinguished highways, as it were, of independent, completer advance, allowing their original spark of light to expand and thrill with higher and more vivid force, and to urge forward with more abounding, in formed purpose — all wrought by planetary influence, directed by the unseen spirits (or workers) of the Great "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"ALCHEMY. 191 Original Architect, building His microcosmos of a world from the plans and powers evoked in the macrocosm, or heaven of first forms, which, in thei r multitude and magni - ficence, are as changeable shadows cast off from the Central Immortal First Light, whose rays dart from the centre to the extremest point of the universal circumference.

In other words, the Rosicrucians claimed not to be bound by the limits of the present world, but to be able to pass into this next world (inaccessible only in appearance), and to be able to work in it, and to come back safe (and self - same) out of it, bringing their trophies with them, which were gold, obtained out of this master - circle, or outside elementary circle, different from ordinary life, though encl osing it; and the elixir vitæ , or the means of the renewal or the per - petuation of human life through this universal, immortal medicine, or magisterium, which, being a portion of the light outside, or magic, or breath of the spirits, fleeing from man, and only to be won in the audacity of God - aided alchemic exploration, was independent of those mastered natural elements, or nutritions, necessary to ordinary common life. The daily necessary food which is taken for the sustenance of the body was, as the Ros icrucians con - tended, the means of dissolution, or death daily passing through and the real cause of the destruction of the body, by the slowest of all processes, but yet, in instalments, the effectual one. They asserted that man dies daily in his own n ative bodily corruptions. These singular philosophers ventured the assertion that God did not, in the beginning, intend that man’s life should be terminated by diseases, nor that he should be made subject to accidental, violent it is “Suspension in Repose” — it is as the “Twilight” of the Soul before and after the “Day” of Full Life, or complete consciousness. These ideas are as equally Christian as Pagan. How little is all this supposed in the ig norance of the moderns!"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"THE ART OF THE GOLD-MAKERS. 193 means of end. In the abstra ct sense, and apart from our knowledge of man as man, the Rosicrucians contended that diseases are not necessarily incidental to the body, and that death may be said to have become an imported accident into the scheme of things: our ideas being errone - ous as to the original design in regard of us. Man was to have lived as the angels, of an impregnable, impassible vitality, taking his respiration, not by short snatches, as it were, but as out of the great cup of the centuries. He was to be the spectator of nature —not nature his spectator. The real objects of the adepts were, in truth, to remain no longer slaves to those things supposed to be necessities, but, by the assistance of Heaven, to remove back to Heaven’s original intention; to rise superior t o the consequences of the original Curse, and to tread under foot, in vindicating the purpose of God, that mortal (how - ever seductive), sexual, distinctive degradation entailing dissolution, heired from Adam, or from the First Trans - gressor. That poverty and celibacy (under certain limita - tions) must be the obligations of the true Brothers of the “R. C.” will at once be seen from the above reasons, however wild and mistaken —barely even comprehensible. This is the real original reason for the monastic stat e— defying and denying nature. The original curse was entailed upon mankind by eating of “the fruit Of that forbidden ‘Tree,’ whose mortal taste Brought death into the world, and all our woe.” What that “Tree” was, and what are its votive, idolatrous (in t he bad sense) symbols in the old world and in the new, we think we have abundantly shown -at least, in the occult, shadowy idea. Why, supposing that the alchemists ever possessed the power of universal gold -making, they fail of producing any, or of offerin g one of their rich gifts to the world, is at once answered in these two conclusive, obvious facts: Firstly, that if this power of gold -making, or of transmutation, were a recognised possibility, like any other"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 194 art allowed or authorised, it would inevitabl y become penal or impossible, in order to preserve the existing value of gold, the richest metal; and the professor of the art would be at once put out of sight. Secondly, if supposed to be true, and no fable, like any ordinary art or science, the man who had arrived at such a stupendous secret would be sacrificed or martyred in the insatiate haste of the people to compel him to produce gold, in order to satisfy them - that gold, more - over, which will destroy, but can never satisfy. “Ye can - not serve God and Mammon.” These things the alchemists too well know, and therefore they (if any exist now) hide, as they have always hidden, and deny, as they have always denied; being desirous of stealing through the world un - known and of serving God alone, whose inacce ssible great glory, as we see, has been imitated in the golden lights of the inexpressibly grand (in the worldly and mortal sense), apostate constructions of the magnificent Mammon, Lord of the Treasures of this World, for which men offer them - selves will ing victims even to Him, King of the Visible, whose semblance is that of the most brilliant yellow element — Fire — Or , “Golden Flame,” the “Flower” of the Fire. The alchemists maintain that the metals are produced in the secret operations of the planets, tha t grow them daily in the bowels of the earth; that the sun and moon, red and white, fire and water, light and darkness, male and female, night and day, are active in the generation of the precious metals, of which gold is due wholly to the invisible oper ation of the sun and moon, and silver is referable to the whitening or bleaching lucidity of the moon; that gold is produced quicker or slower according to the faster or slower operations of nature; that it vivifies and vegetates, bears bright seed and mu ltiplies, germinating as fructifying in the matrix, or the laboratories of the earth; that gold is produced with infinite pains, as it were, by these chcmic operations of nature, very slowly under certain circum - stances, but very rapidly under other more favourable, more powerful conditions; that it is possible for the adept to act as the midwife of nature, and to assist in her deliverance,"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"MACROCOSM AND MICROCOSM. 195 and in the birth of gold, in these occult senses; that the work of nature being thus expedited by this alchemical art , the hitherto thwarted intention of Providence is effected in the predetermined liberation of the divine gold, “Lux,” or light, which is again united to its radix, or producing -point, in heaven. A spark of the original light is supposed by the Rosi - cruc ians to remain deep down in the interior of every atom. The Rosicrucian Cabala teaches that the three great worlds above—Empyræum, Ætheræum, and the Elementary Region —have their copies in the three points of the body of man : that his head answers to th e first; his breast, or heart, to the second; and his ventral region to the third. In the head rests the intellect, or the magnetism of the assenting judgment, which is a phenomenon; in his heart is the conscience, or the emotional faculty, or the Savio ur; and in the umbilical centre reside the animal faculties, or all the sensitives. Nutrition is destruction in the occult sense, and dissolution is rescue in the occult sense; because the entity, or visible man, is constructed in the elements, and is as equally ashes, or condemned matter, as they are; and because the fire that feeds the body (which is its natural respiration or maintenance) is in itself that which (however slowly) destroys it. Man lives upon the lees of nature, or (in the Bhuddistic view ) upon the “gross purgations of the celestial fire,” which is urging itself clear through the opera - tion of the divine rescuing spirit in it. It follows that metaphysically all the wonderful shows of life are phantas - mata only, and their splendours false and a show only. But as these shows are the medium and the instruments of life, without which intelligence (in the human sense) would be impossible, this celestial “Second Fire” has been deified in the acknowledgments of the first inhabitants of the world , who raised pillars and stones in its honour as the first idol. Thus man bears in his own body the picture of the “Triune.” Reason is the head, feeling is the breast, and the mechanical means of both feeling and reasoning, of the means of his being Ma n, is the epigastric centre, from which the two first spring as emanations, and with which the two first form ultimately but “one.” The invisible mag -"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 196 netic, geometrical bases, or latitudes, of these three vital points, whose consent, or coincidence, or identity, forms the “microcosm,” which is a copy of the same form in heaven, answer magically to their stellar originals. This is astro - logical “ruling” by pyramidal culmination, and by trilinear descent or efflux, to an intersecting point in the latitud es of the heavens and in the man’s body, at which upper and lower, or heaven and earth, interchange; and Man is there - fore said to be made “in the image” of the Archetype, who has “descended” to man, who has “ascended” to Him. This is the “hinge -point” o f the natural and the super - natural, upon which the two wings of the worlds real and unreal revolve. The starry heavens, through whose astro - logical cross -work complications (as in a map) all these infinite effects are produced, and on whose (for, taki ng gravitation away, they are the same) floor of lights, or cope or dome of signs or letters, all the “past, present, and future” has been written by the finger of God (although to man they are ever rearranging), can be read by the com - petent as Fate. N atural and supernatural, though one is only the reversed side of the other, as “darkness is only the reversed side of light, and light is only the reversed side of darkness,” * are mistaken by man for opposites, although they are the same : man living in th is state in darkness, although his world is light; and heaven in this state being darkness, although this state is light. Music (although it is unheard by man) is necessarily produced in the ceaseless operations of material nature, because nature itself is penitential and but the painful (and musical) expression between two dissonant points. The Bhuddist contends that all forms are but the penance of nature. Music is life, and life is music. Both are pain, although made delightful. Phenomena are not real . Thus colours to the human are negative as music addressed to the ear, the musical notes negative as colours addressed to the eye, and so on of the other senses, although they are all the same in the imagination, without the sensorium —as dreams show. And life and the world, in this view, are all * “ Compte de Gabalis ” : —Rosicrucian."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"STRANGE IDEAS CONCERNING MUSIC. 197 imagination : man being made in idea, and only in his own belief. This, again, is only pure Parseeism; and the whole will be rightly regarded as the most extraordinary dream of philosophy —as depth of depths beyond idea. Schubert, in his Symbolism of Dreams , has the following passages, which we have before adduced and made use of for illustration: “It may be asked whether that language, which now occupies so low a place in the estimation of men, be not the actual wa king language of the higher regions, while we,” adds the philosopher, coming out with something very strange, “awake as we fancy ourselves, may be sunk in a sleep of many thousand years, or, at least, in the echo of their dreams, and only intelligibly catc h a few dim words of that language of God, as sleepers do scattered expressions from the loud conversation of those around them.” The following is a fair view of the Rosicrucian theory concerning music. The whole world is taken as a musical instrument; tha t is, a chromatic, sensible instrument. The common axis or pole of the world celestial is intersected —where this superior diapason, or heavenly concord or chord, is divided -by the spiritual sun, or centre of sentience. Every man has a little spark (sun) in his own bosom. Time is only protracted consciousness, because there is no world out of the mind conceiving it. Earthly music is the faintest tradition of the angelic state ; it remains in the mind of man as the dream of, and the sorrow for, the lost paradise. Music is yet master of the man's emotions, and therefore of the man. Heavenly music is produced from impact upon the paths of the planets, which stand as chords or strings, by the cross -travel of the sun from note to note, as from planet to plan et; and earthly music is microscopically an imitation of the same, and a “relic of heaven;” the faculty of recogni - tion arising from the same supernatural musical efflux which produced the planetary bodies, in motived projection from the sun in the centre , in their evolved, proportional, harmo - nious order. The Rosicrucians taught that the “harmony of the spheres” is a true thing, and not simply a poetic"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 198 dream: all nature, like a piece of music, being produced by melodious combinations of the cross -movem ent of the holy light playing over the lines of the planets: light flaming as the spiritual ecliptic, or the gladius of the Archangel Michael, to the extremities of the solar system. Thus are music, colours, and language allied. Of the Chaldsean astrology it may figuratively be said that, although their knowledge, in its shape of the “Porten - tous Stone,” —in this instance, their grave -stone, —shut up the devils in the depths of the “Abyss,” and made the sages their masters (Solomon being the Priest or King, a nd his seal the “Talisman” that secures the “Deep”); Man, on account of his having fallen into the shadow and the corrup - tions of E XISTENCE , needs that mighty exterior H AND (be - fore which all tremble) to rescue him back into his native original Light or Rest. All the foregoing is pure Bhuddism. Thinkers who have weighed well the character of those supposed infractions of natural laws which have admitted, as it were philosophically, the existence of other indepen - dent, absent, thinking spirits, communica ting intelligibly in this world of ours, insist “that it is impossible to suppose that the partitions between this world and the other world are so thin as that you can hear the movers in the other through.” Nevertheless, thoughtful people are equally able to convict modern philosophical realists of absurdity, when the former adduce the following insurmountable objection against them: “When we tell you of a supernatural thing,” say the supernaturalists to the realists, “you directly have recourse to a natu ral thing in which to find it. ” This is contrary to common sense; and therefore the realistic arguer has no right to dispose in this manner of that which is supernatural; for his objections are futile and vain, and his arguments contradict themselves. S pirit and mat - ter, when sought to be explained, are totally opposed; and hence arises the reason why there can never be any belief of impossible things, and only the conviction that such things have been in the mind, notwithstanding the insur - mountable co ntradiction of the senses."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" Bheems Chlori. (Mokundra Pass.) CHAPTER THE TWENTY - FOURTH. THE GREAT PYRAMID. N a very elaborate and interesting book, published in the year 1867 , the title of which, at length, is the following: “Life and Work at the Great Pryamid. By C. Piazzi Smyth, Professor of Practical Astronomy in the University of Edinburgh, and Astronomer Royal for Scotland. Edmonston & Douglas, Edinburgh and London. 1867 :” the conclusions (though a mistake) which we now supply from the author are offered as definitions, after infinite card, of this important name or word, “ P YRAMID .” “Pyramid” is derived in this book from two Greek terms — purÒj , “wheat;” metron , “measure;” or from Coptic roots, signifying pyr , “division;” met , “ten.” However, we offer to deduce this term “Pyramid” from quite another source. The present writer originally sought to do this in the year 1860 , in a dissertation on the origin and purpose of the “Pyramids of Egypt.” It is well known that the letters P and F are radically the same letter (as is evidenced by their peculiar pronunciation in certain countries), and that they are interchangeable. In Professor Smyth's book, PurÒj is wrongly translated “wheat.” It signifies “product,” or “growth,” or “elimination ;” in other words, and in the symbolical sense, it means “sun - begotten,” or “fire - begotten.\" The Coptic derivation (re - i"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 200 read by a new light) is the true one. Thus we obtain another reason upon which we rely as the real interpretation of the name of the pyr amid, or obelisk, or great original altar or upright, raised to the divinity working secondarily in nature. Pur is Fire (or Division produced by fire); Metron is Ten (or measures or spaces numbered as ten). The whole word means, and the entire object bea ring this name means, the original Ten Measures or Parts of the Fiery Ecliptic or Solar Wheel, or the Ten Original Signs of the Zodiac. Therefore the Pyramids are commemorative altars raised to the divinity Fire. The Ophites are said to have maintained tha t the serpent of Genesis was the Logoj , and the “Saviour.” The Logos was Divine Wisdom, and was the Bhudda, or Buddha, of India. The Brazen Serpent was called Logoj , or the “Word,” by the Chaldee Paraphrast (Basnage, lib. iv. ch. xxv.) It is very certa in that, in ancient times, the serpent was an object of adoration in almost all nations. The serpent - worshippers seem to have placed at the head, or nearly at the head, of all things (Maia), and most intimately con - nected with the serpent, a. certain pri nciple which they called “Sophia.” This is clearly a translation of the word “Bhudda” into Greek. It also reminds us that the old. Bhuddas are always under the care of the Cobra - Capella. This is evidenced in all the Memnonian or Egyptian heads; and in th e asp (or fleur - de - lis), more or less veiled or altered, displayed as the chief symbol upon the universal Sphynxes. The serpent, in one view, was the emblem of the evil principle, or destroyer. But, as we have seen before, the “destroyer” was the “creato r.” Hence he had the name, among his numerous appellations, of OFIS ; in Hebrew, bwa , Ob; and as he was the “logos,” or “linga,” he was also OY , and in Hebrew armm . Query, hence Sufar , a seraph or serpent? — see Jones's Lexicon ( in voce ), and Sofoj , wise. The Suf and Sof are both the same root. The famous “Brazen Serpent,” called Nehustan, set up by Moses in the Wilderness, is termed in the Targum a “Saviour.” It was probably a “serpentine crucifix,” as it"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"SERPENT-WORSHIP. 201 is called a cross by Justin Martyr. All the f oregoing is allegorical, and hides deep Gnostic myths, which explain serpent -worship, united with the adoration paid to a per - pendicular. The three most celebrated emblems carried in the Greek mysteries were the Phallus, I; the Egg, O; and the Serpent, F ; or otherwise the Phallus, the loni or Umbilicus, and the Serpent. The first, in each case, is the emblem of the sun, or of fire, as the male, or active, generative power. The second denotes the passive nature, or feminine principle, or the element of wa ter. The third symbol indicates the destroyer, the reformer, or the renewer (the uniter of the two), and thus the preserver or perpetuator —eternally renewing itself. The universality of the serpentine worship (or phallic adoration) is attested by emblema tic sculpture and architecture all over the world. This does not admit of denial. Its character and purpose are, however, wholly misunderstood. Not only is the worship of the serpent found everywhere, but it everywhere occupies an important station; an d the farther back we go, the more universally it is found, and the more important it appears to have been considered. The Destroyer or Serpent of Genesis is cor - rectly the Renovator or Preserver. In Genesis there is a “Tree of Knowledge” and a “Tree of Life.” Here we have the origin of the Ophites , or Oriental emblematical serpent -worshippers, to account for whom, and for whose apparently absurd object of adoration, our antiquaries have been so uwich perplexed. They worshipped the Saviour - Regenerator under the strangest (but the sublimest) aspect in the world; but not the devil, or malific principle, in our perverse, mistaking ideas, and with the vulgar, downward, literal meanings which we apply. The mythic and mimetic art of the Gnostics is nowhere more admirably or more successfully displayed than in their hieroglyphs and pictured formula. Even in the blazonry and in the collars and badges of chivalry (which seems so remote from them), we find these Ophite hints. The heathen temples and the modern ritualistic churches alike abound in unconscious "},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 202 Gnostic emblems. State ceremony harbours them; they mix with the insignia of all the orders of knighthood; and they show in all the heraldic and masonic marks, figures, and patterns, both of ancient and of modern times. The religion of the Rosicrucians is also concealed, and uncon - sciously carried forward, perpetuated, and ignorantly fos - tered, by the very persons and classes who form, contrive, and wear decorations with special mysterious marks, all th e world over. Every person, in unconsciously repeating certain figures, which form an unknown language, heired from the ancient times, carries into futurity, and into all parts of the world, the same carefully guarded traditions, for the knowing to recogn ise, to whose origin the sun, in his first revolution, may be figuratively said to be the only witness. Thus the great inexpressible “Talisman” is said to be borne to the “initiate” through the ages. Proposals were published some years ago for a book enti tled, “The Enigma of Alchemy and of Œdipus resolved; designed to elucidate the fables, symbols, and other mytho - logical disguises, in which the Hermetic Art has been enveloped and signalised in various ages, in ecclesiastical ceremonies, masonic formula, astronomical signs, and con - stellations, — even in the emblazonments of chivalry, heraldic badges, and other emblems; which without explanation, have been handed down, and which are shown to have originated in the same universal mystic school, through each particular tracing their allusion to the means and mecha - nism.” This intended work was left in MS. by its anony - mous author, now deceased, but was never published. The unknown author of it produced also in the year 1850 , in 1 vol. 8 vo, a book displayin g extraordinary knowledge of the science of alchemy, which bore the name, “A Suggestive Enquiry into the Hermetic Mystery; with a Dissertation on the more celebrated of the Alchemical Philosophers.” This book was published in London; but it is now extinc t, having been bought up — for suppression, as we believe — by the author’s friends after his decease, who probably did not wish him to be supposed to be mixed up in such out - of - the - way inquiries."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"THE DRAGON OF CHINA. 203 The Vedas describe the Persian religion (Fire -Worship) as havi ng come from Upper Egypt. “The mysteries cele - brated within the recesses of the ‘hypogea’ ” (caverns or labyrinths) “were precisely of that character which is called Freemasonic, or Cabiric.

Pococke, in his India in Greece , is very sagacious and true in his arguments; but he tells only half the story of the myths in his supposed successfu l divestment of them of all unexplain - able character, and of exterior supernatural origin. He supposes that all the mystery must necessarily disappear when he has traced, and carefully pointed out, the identity and transference of these myths from India i nto Egypt and into Greece, and their gradual spread westward. But he is wholly mistaken; and most other modern explainers are equally mistaken. Pococke contemplates all from the ethnic and realistic point of view. He is very learned in an accumulation of particulars, but his learning is “of the earth, earthy;” by which we mean that, like the majority of modern practical philosophers, he argues from below to above, and not, in the higher way, from above to below, or (contrary to the inductive, or Aristot elian, or Baconian method) from generals to particulars, or from the light of inspiration into the sagacities of darkness, as we may call unassisted world’s knowledge, —always vain.

Emanations are supposed to pass through the seven planetary regions, signified by these Chaldæan names, on their way to this world. It was through these seven planetary spiritual regions, or spheres, filled with their various orders of angels, that the Gnostics mythed the Saviour Jesus Christ to have passed secretly; disguising Himself and His Mission in order to win securely to His object. In evading recognition, in His acceptable disguises, through these already -created “Princedoms of Angels,” He veiled His purpose of His Voluntary Sacrifice for the Human Race till He was safe, in His investment in “Humanity,” for the accepted “Propitiation” —through the “Virgin,” for pr oduction only; not for “office.” There was deep mystery in the Gnostic method of teaching that, although the “Sacrifice” (the source of sacrifice in all faiths) was complete and real and perfect, the Saviour did not —nor could —suffer bodily or be nailed rea lly , and die upon the Cross, but that He suffered in appearance only, and vicariously —the Scripture being mis - read. The Gnostics maintained that Simon the Cyrenean —who, the Evangelist states, bore His cross —did really bear it as the culprit, and suffer ed upon it.

There is a deep mystery underlying all these ideas, which we find differently accounted for in the various theologies. We are here only speaking some of the abstruse specula - tions of the old philosopher s, whose idea of creation, and of the nature of man and his destiny, differed most materially —if not wholly —from the acceptable ideas which they chose to inculcate, and which they wished to impress upon ordi - nary minds.

These two columns comprise a part of the colonnade in the White Tower, or central tower, of the Tower of London. The capital of the first column is square, but it is rounded at the angles by a cut to the hypotrachelium , or base - ring, of the capital. The tops of these cuts are formed by volutes similar to the horns of the Corinthian and Ionic capitals. The male volute is to the right, and is a spiral volve, from which issues a dependent budding flower, dropping seed. The volve to the left, which is a series of rings enclosing a point, is female. A twisted perpendicular, like a horn, projects from the base on this left side. The capital of the other column presents a not unusual Norman form of two truncated tables or faces rounded below and divided in the middle. These we inter - pret as meaning the “woman” and the “man,” side by side, and left and right. These glyphs in the two capitals of the colu mns signify “Jachin” and “Boaz,” and stand for the “First Man” and the “First Woman.” The mysterious letter “Tau,” which is the same as the Runic Hammer of Thor, and which in truth is a “Cross,” occupies the centre - point, or, heraldically, the “honour - po int,” of the first column to the right.

See Plutarch de E apud Delph . Lord Monboddo’s Origin and Progr ess of Language ( 1774 ), vol. ii. p. 85 , refers to this letter E. Fig. 172 . The Delphic “E” means the number “Five,” or the half of the Cabalistic Zodiac, or the Five Ascending Signs. This “Delphic E” is also the Seleucidan Anchor.

One of the charges against the Knights Templars w as as follows: “That they bound, or touched, the head of an idol with cords, wherewith they bound themselves about their shirts or next their skins” (“Processus contra Tem - plarios,” Dugd. Monast. Ang . vol. vi. part ii. pp. 844 - 846 ,"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 240 &c.). There is somethin g strange about these cords; cor - dons, ropes, belts, bands, baldrics (also in the term “belted earls”). These are always male accessories; except the “zones,” sashes, or girdles, worn as the mark of virgins, which cinctures may yet draw their symbolic m eaning from this same “ umbilicus ” in question. The reader will notice also the connection of these ideas and the practice in the Roman race of the “Lupercal,” at the February Roman religious solemnities (February of the “Fishes”). At these it was the cu stom of the runners to flog bystanders, particu - larly women ) with thongs or cords; which were probably intended to be the racers’ own girdles. Julius Cæsar, Mark Antony, and Calphurnia form a group illustrative of this meaning. Thus Shakspeare: '' Our el ders say, The barren, touched in this holy chase, Shake off the sterile curse.\" Julius Cæsar , act. i. sc. 2. Is this the origin of the custom of the people pelting or flogging each other at the Italian Carnivals ? It seems highly probable. The Carnivals occur at the same time as these Roman Lupercalia . Many early Norman mouldings exhibit various examples of the cable. Thongs, ties, and network are seen to bind all the significant figures in the early English and Irish churches. Is there any connection between these bonds, or ties, or lacings, with the “cable - tow” of the initiates among the Masons? Perhaps the “tow” in this “cable - tow” means the “Tau,” or stood for it originally. Reference may here be made to the snake which forms the girdle of the G nostic “Good Shepherd” in the illustration later in our book (fig. 252 ). The cable - mouldings in Gothic architecture are intended to carry an important meaning. They are found in the pointed or Christian architecture in continual close connec - tion with t he triplicated zigzag, the Vandykes, or “ aquarii ,” as we designate them, because all these architectural forms, which are hieroglyphs, mean the feminine or “Second Prin -"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"FIGURES OF THE “ CENTUARI. ” 241 ciple,” and express the sign of Aquarius, with its watery or lunar hints, its twin -fishes, and its Jonah -like anagrams of the “Redeemer.” Hence the boat -like, elongated, peculiar form called the vesica piscis , which is the oblong shuttle - shaped frame continually set over doors and windows and elsewhere in Gothic churches, to contain effigi es of the Saviour, or Virgin Mary, or groups from the New Testa - ment in connection with these Two Sacred Persons. A doorway in Barfreston Church, Kent, supplies an excellent example of the employment of this oblong figure; which is also Babylonian, and m eans the female member as its starting -point In a previous part of our book we give various figures of the prows or cutwater -heads of gondolas, in which we clearly show the origin of their peculiar form, which represents the seeuris , or “sacrificial axe,” that crook originally expressed in the “hook of Saturn.” The “Bu -Centaur” indicates the fabulous being, the bicorporate “ox” or “horse” and “Man,” as will be found by a separation of the syllables “Bu -Centaur.” It is the name of the state -galley of the Doge of Venice, used on the occasion of his figurative stately marriage with the Adriatic, or espousal of the “Vir - gin of the Sea,” who was Cybele of the “sacrificial hook.” The hatchet of Dis, the glaive, the halberd, the reaping - hook of Ceres, the cres cent moon, the “Delphic E,” are all the same mystic figure. The prow of the gondola exhibits unmistakably the securis and fasces conjointly, or the axe of the sacrifice and the rods for the scourging of the victim first, if human, and afterwards for his b urning, —the rods being the firewood. Lictors have their name probably from “ Llec .” From this peculiar cutwater arose the Dragon - beak, the “Prow,” or “Frow,” the figure -head and fiddle - head. They have all a feminine origin.

Origen calls the Sun, Adonai; the Moon, lao; Jupiter, El oi; Mars, Sabao; Orai, Venus; Astaphai, Mer - cury; Ildabaoth, Saturn. All this is Gnostic — highest mysticism therefore. The name Tarasque is given for the Dragon of a Northern Nation. (Qy. the “Hill of Tara,” &c. ?) Under the Roman Emperors, and under the Emperors of Byzantium, every cohort or centurion bore a dragon as its ensign (Modestus, De Vocabu. Rei Milit.; Flav. Veget.

Matthew of Westminster, speaking of the early battles of thi s country of England, says: “The King’s place was between the Dragon and the Standard” — “Regius locus fuit inter draconem et standardum” (Lower’s Curiosities of Heraldry , p. 96 ).

That, they have never done so is true, except at those times when profound mythic meanings were not understood or were neglected. This smoothness of a sailor’s face arises from the fact that th e sea has always been mythologically feminine, and that sailors and men or followers of the sea are under the protection of the “Queen of the Deep,” or the “Virgin of the Sea.” Hence the figure of Britannia, with her sceptre of the sea or trident, and not that of Neptune. The Virgin Mary, the “Star of the Sea,” and Patroness of Sailors, rules and governs the ocean, and her colours are the ultramarine of the “Deep,” and sea -green, when viewed in this phase of her divine character.

The chalice on the tombstone of a knight, or ove r the door of a castle, is a sign of the Knights Templars, of whom St. John the Evangelist was the Patron Saint. The “cup” was forbidden to the laity, and was only received by the Priests, in consequence of the decree of Pope Innocent III., A . D . 1215 . It means the “S.S.,” or Holy Spirit, to which we have frequently adverted. We have carefully inspected that which has been desig - nated the crux antiquariorum , or the Puzzle of Antiquaries, namely, the famous Font, which is of unknown and be - wildering an tiquity, in the nave of Winchester Cathedral. Milner (a feeble narrator and misty unreliable historian), in his History of Winchester , has the following superficial notice of this relic: “The most distinguished ornaments on the top are doves ‘breathing’ ” (they are not ‘breathing,’ they are drinking)” into phials surmounted with crosses fichée . And on the sides” (the north side, he should say, which is faced wrongly, and ought properly to front the east) “the doves are again depicted with a salamander , emblematic of fire; in allusion to that passage of St. Matthew, —‘He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. ’ ” All the secrets of masonry are concealed in the Hebrew or Chaldee language. In the First Chapter of the Gospel according to St. Joh n is contained the mythical outline of the Cabala, in its highest part. “Les anciens astrologues, dit le plus savant les Juifs” (Maimonides), “ayant consacré à chaque planète, un e con - leur , un animal , un bois , un métal , un fruit , une plante , ils formaient de toutes ces choses une figure ou répresentation de l’astre, observant pour cet effet de choisir un instant approprié , un jour heureux , tel que la conjonction , ou tout autre aspect favorable.

The mystic emblems of the religions of India, China, Greece, and Rome are closely similar, and are set forth in the ornament s on the friezes of the temples of all those countries, explaining their general principles. “Your popular societies are an emanation from the lodges of the Freemasons, in like manner as these proceeded from the funeral pile of the Templars” (“ Castle ” o f the Tuilerics , year viii.) Thus the “egg - and - tongue moulding” (“egg and adder's tongue,” for the egg and the serpent were two of the emblems of the Egyptian and Greek mysteries), the griffin, the lion of St. Mark, the honeysuckle - and - lotus orna - ment t he convolutions and volutes, the horns as floriations springing from the lighted candelabra, the lotus and tori of Egypt, and the Greek ornaments and Roman Templar ornaments, are all related in their religious meanings. The names of the “Three Kings,” or “Shepherds,” who descried the Star of Annunciation in the East, are Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar. Caspar, or Gaspar, is the “White One;” Melchior is the “King of Light;” Balthasar, the “Lord of Treasures.” Balthasar or Balthazar, is the Septua - gint s pelling of Belshazzar. Linga is the old name of an island near lona, called the “Dutchman's Cap.” (Qy. the Phrygian cap? — also the first “cocked hat,” and its recondite meaning?) Gallus, or the Cock, is sacred to Mars, whose colour is red. In this conne ction, and as bespeaking Hermes or Mercurius, the “messenger of the dawn,” may have arisen the use of the “cock,” as the emblem supposedly of the first descrier of the daily light from the tops of the steeples. It probably signifies the phallic myth. Th e grasshopper, dragon, arrow, and fox, as weathercocks, have undoubtedly a remote reference to the same idea of symbolising the “Prince of the Powers of the Air.” The form of the Pointed Arch reached the Orientals — as we see in their Temples — in the shape of the Phry -"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"THE “ PRINCE OF THE POWERS OFTHE AIR. ” 247 gian and Median Bonnet (Lascelles, 1820 ).

The glories around sacred persons and objects, which have straight -darting and curvilinear or wavy or serpentine rays alternately, are continual in theological or heraldic illustration; which waved and straight rays alternately imply a deep mystery.

Growth and development are assumed as taken from expan - sion and radiation off a nervous sensitive centre, by election or af finity governed by an invisible Power operating from without. It is to descend very deep into cabalistic and Talmudical mysteries to gain comprehension of an idea concerning the origin of this absurd worship of animal horns. The cabalist Simeon Ben - Iochay declares that it was in gratitude for this changed intention, and because the creature man became “Man,” and not the bovine creatures, — a “catastrophe which might have happened, except for this di - version of the brain - power into horns” (mere fable or dream as all this sounds!) — that the Egyptians setup the very “horns” to worship as the real thing — the depositor or “ark” — into which the supernatural “rescue” was committed.

N the following part of our book, we supply, in a series of figures, the succession of changes to which the most ancient head -covering, —in itself a significant hieroglpyh, —the Phryg ian cap, the classic Mithraic cap, the sacrificial cap, or Bonnet conique , all deducing from a common symbolic ancestor, became subject. The Mithraic or Phrygian cap is the origin of the priestly mitre in all faiths. It was worn by the priest in sacrific e. When worn by a male, it had its crest, comb, or point, set jutting forward; when worn by a female, it bore the same prominent part of the cap in reverse, or on the nape of the neck, as in the instances of the Amazon’s helmet, displayed in all old sculp tures, or that of Pallas -Athene, as exhibited in the figures of Minerva. The peak, pic , or point, of caps or hats (the term “cocked hat” is a case in point) all refer to the same idea. This point had a sanctifying meaning afterwards attributed to it, wh en it was called the christa , crista , or crest, which signifies a triumphal top, or tuft. The “Grenadier Cap,” and the loose black Hussar Cap, derive remotely from the same sacred, Mithraic, or emblematical bonnet, or high pyramidal cap. It, in this insta nce, changes to black, because it is devoted to the illustration of the “fire -workers” (grenadiers), who, among i"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 254 modern military, succeed the Vulcanists, Cyclopes , classic “smiths,” or servants of Vulcan, or Mulciber, the artful worker among the metals in t he fire, or amidst the forces of nature. This idea will be found by a reference to the high cap among the persians, or Fire - Worshippers; and to the black cap among the Bohemians and in the East. All travellers in Eastern lands will remember that the tops of the minarets reminded themof the high - pointed black caps of the Persians. The Phrygian Cap is a most recondite antiquarian form; the symbol comes from the highest antiquity. It is dis - played on the head of the figure sacrificing in the celebrated scu lpture, called the “Mithraic Sacrifice” (or the Mythical Sacrifice), in the British Museum. This loose cap, with the point protruded, gives the original form from which all helmets or defensive headpieces, whether Greek or Bar - barian, deduce. As a Phry gian Cap, or Symbolising Cap, it is always sanguine in its colour. It then stands as the “Cap of Liberty,” a revolutionary form; also, in another way, it is even a civic or incorporated badge. It is always masculine in its meaning. It marks the “needle ” of the obelisk, the crown or tip of the phallus , whether “human” or representative. It has its origin in the rite of circumci - sion — unaccountable as are both the symbol and the rite. The real meaning of the bonnet rouge , or “cap of liberty,” has been inv olved from time immemorial in deep obscurity, notwithstanding that it has always been regarded as a most important hieroglyph or figure. It signifies the supernatural simultaneous “sacrifice” and “triumph.” It has descended from the time of Abraham, and it is supposed to emblem the strange mythic rite of the “ circumcisio preputii .” The loose Phrygian bonnet, bonnet conique , or “cap of liberty,” may be accepted as figuring, or standing for, that detached integument or husk, separated from a certain point or knob, which has various names in different languages, and which supplies the central idea of this sacrificial rite — the spoil or refuse of which (absurd and unpleasant as it may seem) is borne aloft at once as a “trophy” and as the “cap of liberty.”"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"THE PHRYGIAN CAP. 255 It is now a magic sign, and becomes a talisman of sup - posedly inexpressible power —from what particular dark reason it would be difficult to say. The whole is a sign of “initiation,” and of baptism of a peculiar kind. The Phrygian cap, ever after this first inauguration, has stood as the sign of the “Enlightened.” The heroic figures in most Gnostic Gems, which we give in our illustrations, have caps of this kind. The sacrificer in the sculptured group of the “Mithraic Sacrifice,” among the marbles in the British Museum, has a Phrygian cap on his head, whilst in the act of striking the Bull with the poniard —meaning the office of the immolating priest. The bonnet conique is the mitre of the Doge of Venice. Besides the bonnet rouge , the Pope’s mitre —nay, al l mitres or conical head -coverings —have their name from the terms “Mithradic,” or “Mithraic.” The origin of this whole class of names is Mittra, or Mithra. The cap of the grenadier, the shape of which is alike all over Europe, is related to the Tartar la mbskin caps, which are dyed black; and it is black also from its association with Vulcan and the “Fire -Worshippers” (Smiths). The Scotch Glengarry cap will prove on examination to be only a “cocked” Phrygian. All the black conical caps, and the meaning of this strange symbol, came from the East. The loose black fur caps derive from the Tartars. The “Cap of Liberty” ( Bonnet Rouge ) the Crista or Crest (Male), and the Female (Amazon) helmet, all mean the same idea; in the instance of the female crest the knob is, however, depressed, —as shown in the figures below.

Judge, — in imitation of the Egyptian Klaft; the black Coif placed on the sen - sorium, is the mark or “brand” of Isis (Saturn). Regarding the Templar insignia, we may make the following remarks. The famous flag, or “Beauséant,” was their distinguishing symbol. Beauséant — that is to say, in the Gallic tongue, Bien - séant , because they are fair and honourable to the friends of Christ, but black and terrible to His enemies: “Vexi llum bipartitum, ex Albo et Nigro, quod nominant ‘ Beau - séant ,’ id est, Gallicâ linguâ, ‘ Bien - séant ’ eo quod Christi amices candidi sunt et benigni, inimices vero terribiles atque nigri” (Jac. de Vitr. Hist . Hierosol . apud Gesta Dei , cap. Ixv.) The Cardina l de Vitry is totally uninformed as to the meaning and purpose indicated in this mysterious banner. Its black and white was originally derived from the Egyptian sacred “black and white,” and it conveys the same signi - ficant meanings. Now, in the heraldic sense, — as we shall soon see, — there is no colour white. Argent is the silver of the moon’s light, the light of the “woman;” or it is light generally, in oppo - sition to darkness, which is the absence of all colour. White is the synthesis and identity of a ll the colours — in other words, it is light. Thus white is blazoned, in the correct heraldic sense, as also in reference to its humid, feminine origin (for, as the old heralds say, “light was begotten of darkness,” and its “type, product, and repre - sentati ve, woman, also”), as the melancholy or silver light of the moon, “Argent;” also, in the higher heraldic grade,"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"SYMBOLS OF THE TEMPLARS. 259 “Pearl,” as signifying tears; lastly, “Luna,” whose figure or mark is the crescent \" , or = ; which is either the new moon (or the moon of hope), or the moon of the Moslem (or “horned moon resting on her back”).

There is annexed to, or connected with, this church an almshouse called “Bede’s House,” the name of which has puzzled all the antiquaries. There is little doubt that this was the original Domus Templi, the house of Buddha, corrupted into Bede, a nd meaning “wisdom.” “A Discourse concerning the Tartars, proving (in all pro - bability) that they are the Israelites, or Ten Tribes; which, being taken captive by Salmaneser, were transplanted into Media.

But upon this abstruse subject of the “Round Table” we have spoken more fully in another place. See Elias Ashmole. Pope John XIV., about the year 970 , issued a Bull for the baptising of bells —“To cleanse the air of devils;” with which it was imagined to be full in the time of storms or of public commotio n. To this end, the kettledrums of the Lacedemonians were also supposed to be used on all extraordinarily harmful occasions. Pagodas are uprights and obelisks, with the same meaning as other steeples, and their angles are set about with bells, which are a gitated in the wind, and are supposed to exercise the same power of driving -off evil spirits. Vesper -bells secure spiritual serenity. The bells of the churches are tolled in thunderstorms still, in some parishes in England, supposedly to disperse the clou ds, and to open their rifts for the returning sunshine. Edward the First of England was in every way an extra - ordinary man. There are certain reasons for supposing that he was really initiated in Eastern occult ideas.

HE branch sect of the Gnostics, called Basilideans, who were properly Ophites, arose in the second century, deriving their name from Basilides, the chief of the Egyptian Gnostics. They taught that in the beginning there were Seven Beings, or Æons, of a most exce llent nature; in whom we recognise the caba - listic Seven Spirits before the Throne. Two of these first Æons, called Dynamis and Sophi a—that is, “Power” and “Wisdom” —engendered the angels of the highest order. The name of Abraxas, the Deity of the Gnostics , is made up of the numerical letters representing the total 365 —the aggregate of days of the solar year. The “manifesting” of Abrasax rests in his Son, N u s (knowledge) or Christ, the chief of the Æons, who descended to earth and assumed the form of “M an;” was baptized, and crucified in appear - ance (Mosheim’s Eccles. Hist. vol. i, pp. 181 - 184 ). The Manichæans, who deny the reality of the Crucifixion of the Son of God, and whose tenets concerning the Saviour Jesus are peculiar, derive their name from Ma nes, or Mani; and their doctrine was first disseminated in Persia about the year 270 . They speak mysteriously of the Anima Mundi , or “Hyle;” they call this principle a deity, and agree with t"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"GNOSTIC “ MATTER ” OR “BODY.” 267 the Rosicrucians in asserting that it is a power presenting itsel f at once in reverse to the world and to the heavens, in as far as that, while it is dark to the one, it is light to the other; and contrariwise. The Gnostic hierarchy consisted of an arch -priest or patriarch, twelve masters, and seventy - two leaders or b ishops. The Gnostics called Matter, or Body, “evil,” and “darkness,” and seemed uncertain whether, in its operations, it were active or passive. It was believed by these sectaries that there were successive emanations of intelligent beings, —these were t he Æons ( a„înej ),—producing the various phases in creation. In this way, there arose in time a mighty being —the Demiurge —who set to work on the inert matter then existing, and out of it formed the world. The reconcilement, or restora - tion, is to the Bhuddistic pleroma , or fulness of light. It is absorption into “annihilation,” or into victory, oblivious of the vexations of “life.” Here, in this fulness of light, —or independence of all worlds, or of life, according to Man’s ideas, —the Supreme God has His habitation: but it is not “nothingness,” according to our ideas of nothing; it is so only because it has not anything in it comprehensible. The Alexandrian Gnostics inclined to the opinion that Matter was inert, or passive; the Syrian Gnostics, on t he contrary, held that it was active. Valentinus came from Alexandria to Rome about A.D. 140 . St. Augustine fell under the Gnostic influence, and retained their beliefs from his twentieth to his twenty -ninth year —viz., from 374 to 383 A . D . Their books ha ve for titles: the Mysteries , the Chapters or Heads , the Gospel , and the Treasure . Refer to Beausobre, Walch, Fuesslin, and Hahn. The Gnostics held that Christ’s teaching was not fully understood even by His disciples; and therefore He pro - mised to send, in due time, a still greater Apostle, the Para - clete, who should effectually separate truth from falsehood. This Paraclete appeared in Mani. The West Front of Lichfield Cathedral displays accu - rately the mythic idea of the union of the Male and Female Pri nciples in the parallel double towers, which are uniform."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 268 The claims for the real reading of the Egyptian hiero - glyphics are distinct and unhesitating, as put forward by the Egyptologists; who, if industry could have succeeded, cer - tainly would have realis ed their desire. But it is extremely doubtful whether, after all, they are not very widely astray. The late Sir George Cornewall Lewis, in his History of Ancient Astronomy , has disposed conclusively of the assumed correctness of most of these interpretati ons. The Egypto - logists, — the principal of whom are Champollion, Rawlinson, Dean Milman, Sir George Lewis (perhaps the best critic), Professor Wilson, Sir Gardner Wilkinson, Dr. Cureton, Dr. Hincks, M. Oppert, Mr. Fox Talbot, — with a large amount of ingeni ous and very plausible research and conjecture, have not truly touched or appreciated these enigmas. They yet remain, baffling the curiosity of the moderns; and they are likely to preserve their real mysteries unread as long as the stones of the Pyramids, and the remembrance of the Sphinx, — if not her visible figure, — themselves endure. We believe that there is no adequate mystical comprehension among modern decipherers to read the hopeless secrets — purposely evading discovery — which lie locked in the hiero - glyphics: the most successful readings are probably guesses only, founded on readily accepted likeness and likeliness. The Temple Church, London, presents many mythic figures which have a Rosicrucian expression. In the span - drels of the arches of the long church, besides the “Beau - séant,” which is repeated in many places, there are the armorial figures following: “Argent, on a cross gules, the Agnus Dei, or Paschal Lamb, or;” “Gules, the Agnus Dei, displaying over the right shoulder the standard of the Te mple; or, a banner, triple cloven, bearing a cross gules;” “Azure, a cross prolonged, potent, issuant out of the cres - cent moon argent, horns upwards; on either side of the cross, a star or.” This latter figure signifies the Virgin Mary, and displays the cross as rising like the pole, or mast of a ship (argha), out of the midst of the crescent moon, or navis biprora , curved at both ends; “azure, semée of estoiles or.” The staff of the Grand Master of the Templars"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"SYMBOLS IN THE TEMPLE CHURCH. 269 displayed a curved cross of four splays, or blades, red upon white. The eight -pointed red Bhuddist cross was also one of the Templar ensigns. The Temple arches abound with brandished estoiles , or stars, with wavy or crooked flames. The altar at the east end of the Temple Church has a cross flourie , with lower limb prolonged, or, on a field of estoiles , wavy; to the right is the Decalogue, surmounted by the initials, A . W .

The whole a ltar displays feminine colours and emblems, the Temple Church being dedicated to the Virgin Maria. The winged horse, or Pegasus, argent, in a field gules, is a badge of the Templars. The tombs of the Tem - plars, disposed around the circular church in Lon don, are of that early Norman shape called dos d’âne : their tops are triangular; the ridge -moulding passes through the temples and out of the mouth of a mask at the upper end, and issues out of the horned skull, apparently, of some purposely trodden crea ture. The head at the top is shown in the “honour -point” of the cover of the tomb. There is an amount of unsuspected meaning in every curve of these Templar tombs; but it would at present too much occupy us to more fully explain. The crook part of a Bis hop’s staff shows the undulating curve of the S.S. issuing out of the foliations: meaning the Blessed Virgin Mary. This is particularly observable in the statue of William of Wykeham, the founder, at St. Mary’s College, Winchester; who, holding the spiri tual crook in the left hand, gives the usual benediction of the two extended fingers with his right. The crook is the Shepherd Crook of the “Second Person,” and of the “Holy Spirit.” We now give a series of Gnostic Talismans, from ori - ginals.

On a narrow review of evidence which evades, there is no doubt that these classic helmets with their “crests,” this pileus, Phrygian cap, Cap of Liberty, or the Grenadiers’ or Hussars’ fur caps, or cocked hats, have all a phallic origin. The Cardina l’s “Red Hat” follows the same idea in a different way; it is a chapel, chapter, chapiter, or chafeau, a discus or table; crimson, as the mystic feminine “rose,” the “Queen” of Flowers, is crimson. The word “Cardinal” comes both from Cardo (Hinge, Hinge - Point, “Virgo” of the Zodiac), and also from Caro , It. Came , flesh, — the “Word made flesh.” It is probable that these mythological hints and secret expressions, as to the magic working of nature, were insinu - ated by the imaginative and ingenious Greeks int o dress and personal appointments. In the temples, and in tem - plar furniture, mythological theosophic hints abound; every curve and every figure, every colour and every boss and point, being significant among the Grecian contrivers, and among those from w hom they borrowed — the Egyptians.

By some the preference of the robust to the delicate sex is accounted beyond all question as self -evident. A certain class of philo - sophers have made no .scruple to call a woman an imperfect and even monstrous animal. These have affi rmed that nature, in generation, always intends a male, and that it is only from mistake or deficiency., either of the matter or the faculty, that a woman is produced.” The oriental ethics have degraded woman to the level of a chattel. It is Christianity alone, in the discovery of the Divine Mary —“Virgin - Mother,” “Mother -Virgin” —that has elevated “Woman,” and found for “Her” a possible place (of course as a Sexed -Sexless, Sexless - Sexed “Idea”), in Heaven —or in that state other than this state; irradiated with the “light,” breathing with the “breath” of Divinity. Almaricus, a doctor at Paris in the twelfth century, advances an opinion that, had the state of innocence continued, every individual ol our species would have come into existence a complete “MAN, ” and that God would have created them by Himself, as He created Adam. He theorises that woman is a defective animal, and that the generation of her is purely fortuitous and foreign from nature's intent. He there - fore infers that there would have been no women “in a state of inno - cence.” On the other hand, there exists a counterbalancing singular idea, combated by St. Austin in his “City of God,” Book xxii., chap. xvii.; and of which its partisans take upon themselves to say that at the universal resurr ection this imperfect work (woman) will be rendered perfect by a change of sex; all the women becoming men — grace and finish being then to complete the work of the human form, which nature (in Man) only, as it were, had left coarse, unfinished, rough -hewn. These ideas resemble closely the conclusions of the alche - mists (or of the Rosicrucians when applying to practical art), who declare that nature, in the production of metals, always intends the generation of gold, and that it is only from accidental dive rsion or inter - posing difficulty, or from the deficiency of the virtue or faculty, that the working -out of the aim falls short, and issues (bluntly and dis -"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 280 appointed) in another metal, — the blanker, blacker, and coarser metals being, in fact, only as th e “ DISEASES “ of matter, which aims at clear perfect health — or as gold. Here the alchemists contend that their superhuman (in apparent - sense) science, felicitously applied, “completes the operation,” and transmutes or compels - on, “into gold” what weaker - handed nature was compelled to “forego” as “iron.” Thus nature always intends the production of male (sun — gold — fire being the workman, or “agent”); but that in the production of female (silver as against gold — the moon — sublimated matter, or “patient”), n ature’s operation miscarries; the effort degenerates into struggle, and struggle submits in failure. Therefore, “Female.” But this shortcoming, when the Divine perfecting - means (in another state, and through another nature or “mode”) is applied, will be rectified. And in the universal resurrection, Women will transcend into the nobler creature, and, changing sex or ceasing sex, will become - “Wornan’d - Men.” Both sexes interchanging “sex” to form the “Angel,” or rather blending sex and uniting sex — bi - co rporatc no longer, but becoming “Ideal” — fit spirit - populace, winnowed of materiality and of humanity. “Unintelligible to the intellect as Music, but beautiful to the heart as Music.” Yet it must be understood that no man's dreams (dreams, we have elsewher e contended, quite contrary to the usual ideas, are real things) are wholly and altogether evil and vain ; for that cannot be except men were utter (or outer) devils, which also cannot be so long as we live in the human nature, for Man's Fall was not like the Fall of the Evil Angels ; for these latter fell into the Dark Abyss, or Original Wrathful Principle (the Rosicrucian “Refuse” or “Lees” of Creation, without, or beyond, nature and creature, and therefore there was for them no help or recovery). But, on the contrary, Men fell and were saved thereby (the Knowledge of Good and Evil), that is, into Nature and Creature, which is Man’s inexpressible happiness, as not being left destitute of Hope or the Regenerating Seed of the Woman. For there does central ly dwell in the human nature that which the wise man calls the Voice of Wisdom, or conscience - recal; which in the suggestion of the Immortal Sorrow planted deep in the soul of man for his “Lost Paradise” (of which the very air and hint and proof to him, is Music — Man’s Music — with its shadow of discords).

The truth is, a woman is the weaker vessel, and was First in the Transgression. Therefore, that sex is an emblem of weakness and a means of seduction. And there - fore there is no reason why the Good Angels, amongst whom there is no difference of sex, should elect to appear as a f emale ; but rather, being a species of creature above humankind, they assume the shape of the most excellent of that kind (only feminine in regard of grace and beauty) ; and for the same reason they may appear without beards, both because ‘hair is an exc rement,’ and verges greatly, in the more conspicuous instances, to the brutish nature, as also more especially in their beardless, beautiful, glorified aspects, and graceful delicacy and yet power of form, to express their perpetual virgin -youth, unspoiled heavenly beauty, and immortal star -born vigour.

All these horns are everywhere devoted in their signification to the Moon. It is in connection with this secondary go d or goddess, who is always recognisable through the peculiar appendage of horns, —it is in proximity to this god or goddess, who takes the second place in the general Pantheon, the Sun taking the first, —it is here, in all the illustrations which the mythi c theology borrows from architecture, or the science of expressing religious ideas through hieroglyphical forms, —that the incoherent horns reiterate, always presenting themselves to recognition, in some form or other, at terminal or at salient points.

The occurrence which gave rise to the formation of the Order, and which explains the adoption of the motto, does not admit of being told, except in far -off, round -about terms; propriety otherwise would be infringed. We may say no more than that it was a feminine accident, of not quite the character commonly accepted, and not quite so simple and ordinar y as letting fall a garter. But this accident, which brought about the"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 284 foundation of the exalted Order, * — however clear it becomes when understood, and however sublime, as the Rosicrucians asserted it was, when it is apprehended in its physiological and al so in its deeply mythic sense, — could not, of neces - sity, be placed before the world, because ordinary persons could not have appreciated it, nor would they have felt any other idea than repulsion and disbelief at the statement. The commonplace, coarse, un prepared mind instantly asso - ciates indecency with any explanation, however conclusive, which cannot for obvious reasons be spoken “on the house - tops.” We are now ourselves, against our desire, compelled to speak circuitously about the real, successfully concealed, very strange origin, in our modern ideas, of this famous “Order of the Garter.” The subject is, however, of very great consequence, because there is either meaning of the highest force in this, which may be called the “brotherhood of princes,” as the Order undoubtedly is in a high sense; or there is no particular meaning, and certainly nothing challenging startled attention. There is either truth in the abstract, occult matters which the Order supposedly is formed to whisper and to maintain, o r there is only empty, meaningless pretence and affectation. There is grandeur and reality in its formalities, or the whole institution is no more than a parade of things that have no solidity, and an assumption of oaths and obligations that regard nothin g of consequence, — nothing of real, vital seriousness. We seek thus to ennoble the “Order” in idea, by giving it conclu - sively the sanction of religion, and rendering to it the respect due to the mighty mystery which may be suspected to lie in it; which it was supposed to emphasise, whatever it be held now.

We are disposed to contemplate the addition of the Moslem banner —the direct contradiction and neu - traliser of the ensigns of the Christian knights —suspended in the Chapel of the Order, the Chapel of St. George at Windsor, as a perplexing, uncomfortable intrusion, according to assumed correct Christian ideas. We fear that the admission of this heathen knight may possibly imply heraldically the infraction of the ori ginal constitutions of the Order, which created it as exclusively Christian. The “Garter” is specially devoted to the Virgin Mary and to the honour (in the glorification of “Woman”) of the Saviour of Mankind. The knights -companions are ac - cepted, suppo sedly, as the special initiated holy guard of the Christian mysteries, and they are viewed as a sworn body of “brothers,” by day and night, from their first association, bound to maintain and uphold, in life and in death, the faith that had Bethlehem fo r its beginning and Calvary for its end. The bond and mark of this brother - hood is the Red Cross of Crucifixion. The “Red Cross” which is the “Cross” of the “Rosicrucians” —thence their name. Even the badge and star and symbol of this most Christian Order , if ever there were a Christian Order, — which presents this red or sanguine cross of the Redeemer, imaged in the cognisance of His champion, or captain, or chief soldier, St. George or St. Michael, the Trampler of the Dragon, and Custos of the Keys of the Bottomless Pit, where the devils are confined, —protests against the mingling of this Mussulman banner with the Red Cross, which opposed it in the hands of the Crusaders, and in those of all Christian knights. Now, all the Christian “Garter” badges only seem to appeal and to protest quietly and under allowance, with “bated breath,” as it were (as if afraid), deficient in firmness and life, leaving results to chance, and abandoning expostulation to be regarded or disregarded (or taken up faintly) accordin g to circumstances .

These officials are its* Prelate and “Garter” himself (the personified “Order”), who are sup - pos ed, because of the sublime duties with which they are charged, to be the guardians of the meanings and the myths of an Order of Knighthood whose heraldic display in one form or other, covers the land (or covers the world) and must be interpreted either as talisman or toy. In these days without faith, wherein science (as it is called in the too arbitrary and overriding sense) has extinguished the lights of enthusiasm, leaving even our altars dark, desecrated, and cold, and has eliminated ail possible wonder from the earth, as miracle from religion, and magic from the sensible or insensible fields of creation, —in these questioning, doubting, dense, incredulous days, it is no inconsistency that the gorgeous emblazonments of the Garter should provoke no more curiosity or religious respect than peculiar ornaments do, signifying anything or nothing. But to return to the import of the title of the Order of the Garter. This is a point very engrossing to heralds, antiquaries, and all persons who are interested in the history, traditions, and archaeology of our country. The origin of the Order would be trivial, ridiculous, and unbelievable, if it be only thought due to the picking -up of a lady’s garter. It is impossible that the great name and fame of this “Gar - ter” could have arisen alone from this circumstance. The Garter, on. the contrary, is traceable from the times of King Arthur, to whose fame throughout Europe as the mythic hero there was no limit in his own period. This we shall soon show conclusively from the accounts of the Garter by Elias Ashmole, who was “Garter King of Arms,” and who was one of its most painstaking and enlightened historians; besides himself being a faithful and conscientious expositor * The Bishop of Winchester always.

The “Round Table” of King Arthur —the “mirror of chivalry” —supplies the model of all the miniature tables, or tablets, which bear the contrasted roses —red and white, as they were originally (and implying the female discus and its accidents) —with the noble “vaunt,” or motto, round them —“Evil to him,” or the same to him, “who thinks ill” of these natural (and yet these magical) feminine circumstances, the character of which our readers will by this time not fail to recognise. The glory of woman and the puni shment of woman after the Fall, as indicated in Genesis, go hand in hand. It was in honour of Woman, and to raise into dignity the expression of the condemned “means” (until sanctified and reconciled by the intervention of the “S.S.,” or of the Holy Spir it, or of the Third Person of the Trinity), which is her mark and betrayal, but which produced the world in producing Man, and which saved the world in the person of the Redeemer, “born of Woman.” It is to glorify typically and mystically this “fleshly ve hicle,” that the Order of the “Garter” —or “Garder” —that keeps it sacred was instituted. The Knights of the Garter stand sentinel, in fact, over “Woman’s Shame,” at the same time that they proclaim her “Glory,” in the pardoned sense. These strange ideas are strictly those of the old Rosicrucians, or Brethren of the “Red Cross,” and we only reproduce them. The early writers saw no indecency in speaking openly of these things, which are usually hidden away, as improper to be spoken about. The blackness o r darkness of “Matter,” or of the “Mother of Nature,” is figured in another respect in the belongings of this famous feminine Order, instituted for the glory of woman. Curious armorists, skilled in the knowledge of the deep sacred symbolism with which the old heralds suffused their illustrations or emblazonments, will remember that black is a feature in the Order of the Garter; and that, among figures and glyphs and hints the most profound, the “Black Book,” containing the original constitutions of the Ord er, —from which \"Black Book\" comes the important"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 288 “Black Rod,” — was lost, or taken away for some secret reason before the time of Henry the Fifth. See pp. 157 - 159 , ante , for previous remarks about the “Garter.” Elias Ashmole mentions the Order in the foll owing terms : “We may ascend a step higher ; and if we may give credit to Harding, it is recorded that King Arthur paid St. George, whose red cross is the badge of the Garter, the most particular honours; for he advanced his effigy in one of his banners, which was about two hundred years after his martyrdom, and very early for a country so remote from Cappadocia to have him in reverence and esteem,” In regard to the story of the Countess of Salisbury and her garter, we shall insert the judgment of Dr. Heyl in, who took great pains to ascertain its foundation. “This I take to be a vain and idle romance,” he says, “derogatory both to the founder and the Order, first published by Polydore Virgil, a stranger to the affairs of England, and by him taken upon no better ground than fama vulgi , the tradition of the common people — too trifling a foundation upon which to raise so great a building.” The material whereof the Garter was composed at first is an arcanum , nor is it described by any writer before Polydore V irgil, and he only speaks of it in general terms. The Garter was originally without a motto. * As to the appointments of the Order, we may gain the most authentic idea of them from the effigies of some of the first knights. Sir William Fitz - warin was bur ied on the north side of the chancel of the church of Wantage, in Berkshire, in the thirty - fifth year of the reign of King Edward the Third. Sir Richard Pembridge, who was a Knight of the Garter, of the time of Edward the Third, lies on the south side of the cathedral of Hereford. The monument of Sir Simon Burley, beheaded A . D . 1388, was raised in the north wall, near the choir of St. Paul’s, London. It is remarkable that Du Chesne, a noted French historian, is the source from which we derive the acknowled gment that it was by the special invocation of St. George that King Edward the Third * A proof that it did not originate with Edward the Third."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"KING ARTHUR’S ROUND TABLE. 289 gained the Battle of Cressy; which “lying deeply in his remembrance, he founded,” continues Du Chesne, “a chapel within the Castle of Windsor, and dedicated it in gratitud e to the Saint, who is the Patron of England.” The first example of a Garter that occurs is on the before -mentioned monument of Sir Francis Burley; where, on the front, to - wards the head, are his own arms, impaling his first wife’s, set within a garter. This wants the impress, or motto. Another shield of arms, having the same impalement placed below the feet, is surrounded with a collar of “S.S.,” of the same form with that about his neck. It was appointed by King Henry the Eighth, and embodied in the S tatutes of the Order, that the collar should be composed of pieces of gold, in fashion of Garters; the ground enamelled blue, and the letters of the motto gold. In the midst of each garter two roses were to be placed, the innermost enamelled red, and the outermost white; contrarily, in the next garter, the innermost Rose enamelled white, and the outermost red, and so alternately; but of later times, these roses are wholly red. The number of these Garters is so many as to be the ordained number of the so vereign and knights -companions. At the institution they were twenty -six, being fastened to - gether with as many knots of gold. And this mode hitherto has continued invariable ; nor ought the collar to be adorned or enriched with precious stones (as the “George” may be), such being prohibited by the laws of the Order. At what time the collar of “S.S.” came into England is not fully determined; but it would seem that it came at least three hundred years since. The collar of “S.S.” means the Magian, or Fi rst Order, or brotherhood. In the Christian arrangements, it stands for the “Holy Spirit,” or “Third Person of the Trinity.” In the Gnostic talismans, it is displayed as the bar, curved with the triple “S.” Refer to the “Cnuphis Abraxoids” occurring in our book, for we connect the collar of “S.S.” with the theology of the Gnostics.

Andrew du Chesne dec lares that this new Order was announced on “New Year’s Day, A.D. 1344 .” There were jousts holden in honour of it on the “Monday after the Feast of St. Hilary following — January 19 th.” There are variations in the histories as to the real period of the inst itution of the Garter; most historians specifying the year 1349.

In imitation of this, the French King, Philip de Valois, instituted a “Round Table” for himself at his court. Some say that he had an intention of instituting an order of knighthood upon the same “feminine subject,” but that he was a nticipated by King Edward; which shows that it was something more than an accident and a mere garter which inspired the idea of this Rose forming the mystery. The knights were denominated “Equites Aurese Periscelidis.” King Edward the Third had such vene ration for the Blessed Virgin Mary, that he ordained that the habit of his Knights of the Garter should be worn on the days of her Five Solemnities. Elias Ash - mole states that the original of the Statutes of Institution had wholly perished long before his time. There was a transcript existing in the reign of Henry the Fifth, in an old book called Registrum Ordinis Chartaceum. Though the Order was instituted so long ago as in the year 1344 , it was not till the reign of Charles the Second that the Knight s were empowered to wear the star they use at present embroidered on their coats. The rays are the “glory” round the “Red Cross.” Sir John Froissart, the only writer of the age that treats of this institution, assigns no such origin as the picking -up of the Countess of Salisbury's garter; nor does he adduce the words of the motto of the Garter as having been spoken by King Edward the Third when encountering the laughter of his court, and assuring them that he would make the proudest eventually wear it as the most illustrious badge. There can be only one conclusion as to the character of the investment which was picked up; and which article of dress makes it clear that the Countess of Salisbury —or the lady, whoever she may be, who has succeeded in becoming so wonderfully celebrated in the after -ages of chivalry —should have rather been at home, and at rest , than inattentive to"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 292 saltatory risks in engaging in a dance or in forgetful gambols at a crowded court.

Polydore does not mention whose garter it was; this he cautiously declines to do. He says that it was either the Queen’s, or that of the King’s mistress, — meaning Joan, Countess of Salisbury, with whom it was supposed the King was in love, and whom he relieved when she was bravely holding out for him against the Scots, in her Castle of Wark - upon - Tweed; but she was certainly no mistress of the King’ s, in the. injurious and unworthy sense. It is to be particularly noticed that the Latin words subli GAR , subligaculum , mean, not a “garter,” but “breeches, drawers, or trousers.” It was therefore not a garter for the leg, but a cincture for the body, whi ch was thus picked up publicly, and elevated for honour, as such an unexpected illustrious object; one around which the most noble knights were to take enthu - siastic oaths of the most devoted religious homage. Now, unless there had been some most extraord inary meaning under all this (lying under the apparent, but only apparent, indecency), such an idolising of a garter could never have occurred, and the whole occurrence ages ago would have been laughed into oblivion, carrying the sublime honours of the “G arter” with it. Instead of this, the Garter is the highest token of greatness the Sovereign of England can bestow, and it is contended for and accepted with eager pride by Princes. “Subligaculum, breeches, drawers, trousers .” “Subligatus, cinctured, bound , &c. , wearing drawers .” The"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"KING EDWARD’S GALLANTRY. 293 origin of the “Garter” is proven in this word not to be a garter at all It is most generally supposed that it was on January 19 th, 1344 , that King Edward instituted his famous Order of the Garter. This period, it will be perce ived, was almost within an octave of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary; under whose patronage, and under the guardianship of St. George on earth (St. Michael in Heaven; both these Saints being the same, with earthly and spiritual attributes refl uent respectively), King Edward placed his profoundly religious Order. The whole was a revival of the “Round Table” of King Arthur, or the apotheosised female discus in certain mythical aspects. To confirm us in our assertion of the feminine origin of t he Order of the Garter —which many in their ignorance have questioned —we may state that one of the old chroniclers, though somewhat guardedly, as befitted those great persons of whom he spoke, declares that the lady who let fall her garter, or “garder,” was the Queen) who had suddenly left the courtly assembly in some confusion, and was hastening to her own apartments, fol - lowed by the King, who, at first, did not perceive the reason when the spectators avoided lifting the article, being aware to whom it bel onged; but who raised it himself, and called aloud, not the words of the motto of the Garter, which the historian says that the Queen herself spoke, but giving an intimation that he would, spite of their laughter, “make the proudest of the refusers wear th e rejected cincture as the grandest badge that knighthood ever bore.” Rightly viewed, this little evaded incident —which we desire to restore to its proper place of due respect in the knowledge of Englishmen —is the most conclusive proof of King Edward’s n obleness and greatness of heart, and of his chivalrous, inexpressibly gallant delicacy; an instance admirable to all future gene - rations, and worthy of the most enduring applause.

These points are of course shifting. The Dragon’s Head is the point where the moon or o ther planet commences its northward latitude; it is considered masculing and benevolent in its influence. The Dragon’s Tail is the point where the planet’s south - ward progress begins; it is feminine and malevolent.

In the modem Persian the word is “Mag,” and “Magbed” signifies high -priest. The high -priest of the Parsees at Surat, even at the present day, is called “Mobed.” The mythic figure placed in the front of the Irish Harp —the meaning of which we have e xplained in a previous part of our book, and which is now represented as a woman with the lower parts twined as foliage, or as scrolls, into the body of the harp —is properly a Siren. This “Siren” is the same as Venus Aphrodite, Astarte, the Sea -Deity, or Woman -Deity, the Dag, Dagan, Dagon, or idol of the Syrians, Tyrians, or Phœnicians: hence her colour is green in the lona, Ierne, or Irish acceptation. The woman or virgin of the Irish Harp, who is impaled on the stock or “Tree of Life” —the Siren whose f atal singing means her mythic Bhuddistic or Buddhistic “penance of existence” — the Medusa whose insupportable beauty congeals in its terror the beholder to stone, according to the mythologists —this magic being is translated from the sign of Virgo in the h eavens, and sent mythically to travel condemned the verdant line of beauty, or the cabalistic benedicta linea viriditatis . The whole of the meaning, notwithstanding its glory, is, none the less, “sacrifice.” The Woman of the Harp of the Seven Strings, or the seven vocables, vowels, or aspirations, or intelligent breathings, or musical notes, or music -producing planets (in their progress), is purely an astrological sigma —although a grand one —adopted into heraldry. In the old books of heraldry, the curious inquirer will find (as will all those who doubt) this “Woman” or “Virgin” of the “Irish Harp” —to whom, in the modern heraldic exemplification, celestial wings are given, and who is made beautiful as an angel (which in reality she is, the other form being only her disguise) —represented as a dragon with extended forky pinions, and piscine or serni - fish -like or basilisk extremity. There is a wonderful"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"THE IRISH “ ANGEL ” OR “SIREN.” 297 refluent, or interfluent, unaccountable connection, in the old mythology, between the “Woman,” the “Dragon” or the “Snake,” and the “Sea:” so that sometimes, in the obscure hints supplied in the picturesque suggestive ancient fables, it is really difficult to distinguish one from the other. The associations of an interchangeable character between dark and lig ht, and “Dragon” and “Hero,” ascribing to each some mystic characteristic of the other, cannot be all fabling accident. There are hints of deep mysteries, tran - scendent in their greatness and beauty, lying under these things in some concealed, real way. To bring these to the surface, to discover their origin, and, to the justifiable and guarded extent, to assign them properly, has been our aim. There must have been some governing, excellent armorial reason, special and authorised, for the changing of this first figure of a dragon into a woman, or a siren, or virgin, on the Irish Harp; and this fact assists the supposi - tion of an identity, at some time, of these two figures, all drawn from the double sign “Virgo -Scorpio” in the Zodiac. There is a stran ge confirmation of the account of Creation in the Book of Genesis, in the discovery of the “Woman and Snake” in the most ancient Babylonian or Chaldæan Zodiac. The Indian zodiacs and the Egyptian zodiacs repeat the same myth, slightly varied in certain pa rticulars. The different versions of the story of the Temptation and Fall, in the main respects, are the same legend, only altered to suit ideas in every varying country. Traversing all the long -descended paths of the mythologies, this singular, but in reality sublime, myth preserves its place, and recurs up to the last in its identity. The first chapter of Genesis seems to us to be clearly found here in the signs of the Zodiac; which we know are derived from the earliest astronomical studies, and whic h extraordinary hieroglyphical zodiacal figures descended originally from the summit of the famous Tower of Bel, or Belus, —the first observatory where the movements and the story of the stars were at the outset noted, and handed as from the earliest exposi tors of the secrets of the heavens.

As the little and the large have sometimes a closer con - nection than is ordinarily supposed, we will pass on now to some more familiar and commonplace examples. It may be worth while to dwell with greater minuteness on the little - understood origin of those light auxiliary troops, as they were organised originally, the modern Hussars. This irregular, lightly - equipped European cavalry plays an impor - tant part as a skirmishing or foraging force. We are all accustomed to see the elegantly appointed light cavalry called Hussars, and doubtless many persons have fre - quently wondered as to the origin of that dolman , pelisse, or loose jacket, which is worn, contrary to all apparent use, dangling — an incum brance rather than a cover or defence — on the trooper's left shoulder. This pelisse, richly em - broidered in the Eastern fashion, is always the genuine distinctive mark or badge, with the Wallachian or Hun - garian, or Oriental busby of the Hussar. The prec ise time when this originally loosely disciplined and heathen soldiery came into Europe is not fixed. They now form a dazzling and formidable branch of light - cavalry service everywhere. All armies of modern times possess regiments of Hussars. They came originally from Tartary and the East, and they brought with them their invariable mark, — the rough fur cap, or Ishmaelitish or “Esau - like” black head - cover. They adventured into the West with the now thickly orna - mented and embroidered “trophy,” called t he pelisse or skin - coat (“ pel ,” from pellis , “skin;” thence “pall”). * This pelisse is an imitation or reminder, and is the very remote symbol, or garment, or “cover of shame,” as it is * In these modern tasteles s, ignorant days all these distinctive learned marks are obliterated in the equipment of troops.

The Hussars (under other names) were originally Eastern, Saracenic, or Moslem cavalry. The horse -tails and jingles, or numberless little bells, which ought to distinguish the caparisons of Hussars to the modern day, and which are part of the special insignia of their origin, are all Oriental in their character, like the bells of the wandering Zingari, “Morris,” or Moresque, or Gypsy, or Bohemian fantastical dancers. Deep -lying in the magical ideas of the Eastern peoples was the sacred - ness, and the efficacy against evil spirits, of their small bells, like the bells of the Chinese pagodas. All bells, in every instance, even from the giant bell of the Dom -Kirche or Duomo, or the cathedrals of Kasan or Casan, Moscow or M uscoyia generally, down to the “knell,” or the “sac - ring” or warning bell of the Romish Mass (which latter “signal” has a signification overpowering in its profundity), are held to disturb and to scare and drive off evil spirits.

For the Divinity to be seen by the profane eye is guilt and annihilation to the latter; therefore the gods and all spirits have, in every account of their appearance, been seen in some worldly form, which might be acceptable to, and sup - portable by, a hum an face. There is, theoretically, such contrariety, and such fatal difference to the constitution of man, in the actual disclosure of a spirit, that it is wholly impossible except by his death; therefore spirits and divine appearances have always been inv ested in some natural escape or guise, by the medium of which the personal communication, whatever it might be, might be made with - out alarm, and without that bodily disturbance of nervous assent which should destroy. This alarm would, by the utter upset ting of the mind, and the possible fatal effect, otherwise have rendered the disclosure impossible.

The Cabalists say that the “Lost Man” Adam should not hav e yielded to those which he found the irresistible fascinations of Eve, but should have contented himself — to speak in parable — with “his enjoined, other impersonated * delights,” whom he outraged in this preference, winning “Death” as its punishment. This i s of course obscure, because it is a part of the secret, unwritten Cabala, never spoken in direct words — never referred to except in parable. In the views of the refining Gnostics, woman is the acci - dental unknowing “obtrusion” upon the universal design. The ideal woman (as “ideal virgin”) is spiritually free (because of her nothingness except “possessed”) from the curse and corruption of things material. From these ideas came the powers superstitiously imagined to be possible in the virgin state, and cap able of being exercised by virgin woman. All the marks and forms connected with these proscribed letters “S” and “Z” have, on their material and worldly side, the character of charms, sigils, and talismans, in the evil sense, or dark sense.

In the Greek letters these ideas make th e form. The first letters, according to the Cabalists, were the original “Ten Signs of the Zodiac,” which contained mythologically the history of the “making of the world.” These “Ten Signs” afterwards multiplied and produced other broods of letters (whe n the original magical knowledge was veiled); some of which were the cuneiform and early tree -like alphabets.

The celebrated philosopher, Petru s Gassendus, assailed the system of Robertus de Fluctibus, or Robert Flood, and criticised it at great length, in his work entitled Exam en in qua Princifia Philosophi æ Roberti Fluddi, Medici, reteguntur, published at Paris in 1630 . But he never really sei zed the spirit of Flood ’s system, and he wasted his force. He did not comprehend, nor could h e ever realise, the Rosicrucian views with the largeness of ins ight of a man of great critical powers, which Gassendus otherwise undoubtedly possessed. Gassendus, however, was a prejudiced theologian, and was ill-calculated for a disquisit ion upon a secret philosophy so remote and subtle. Before an insight of greater depth, of more readiness, and less obstinacy, the difficulties presented by Flood melt away, even co nverting into brilliancy in new proofs.

Gassendus asserts , as the opinion of Flood, that the key of the Bible mysteries is reall y to be found in the processes of alchemy and of the hermetic science; that the mystical sense of Scripture is not otherwise explainable than by the “ Philosopher's Stone; ” and that the attainment of the “Great Art ” or of the secrets which lie locked, i s “ Heaven, ” in the Rosicruci an profundities. Old and New Testament, and their historic al accounts, are alike hermetic in this respect. The “Grand Magisterium ” — the “ Great Work, ” as the alchemists call it — is mythed by Moses in Genesis, in the Del iveranc e from Egypt, in the Passage of the Red Sea, in the Jewi sh Ceremonial Law, in the Lives of the Patriarchs and Prophets, — such as Abraham, David, Solomon, Jacob, Job. In this manner the true Cabalists are supposed to be Alchemists in common with th e Magi, the Sages, Philosophers, an d Priests, when these possessed the “true and only knowledge. ” The “Just Man made Perfect ” is the Alc hemist, who, having found the “Philo - sopher ’ s Stone, ” b ecomes gl orified and immortal by the use of it. To be sa id to “die, ” is when the material elements can n o longer maintain or cohere. To “rise, ” is when the immaterial life or spark is liberated out of its perishable temporary investment. To be “glorified, ” is when the powers, or independence, are atta ined which properly ap - pertain to the supernaturally perfect “Light, ” into which, like Enoch or Elijah, the R osicrucian is transfigured, and in which he knows “ all, ” can be “all, ” and do “all. ” It is this “draught of immortality ” which enables him to assume what form he will, b y passing through Nature as its master, and renewing his body by means of his art projected by Nature through, to the other side of Nature.

The alchemist is supposed to be superior to Nature to that extent, that he can p ass through it (that is, through its appea rances), and work on it, and in it, on the other side. It is here —in this true Anima Mundi , or “Soul of the World ”—that the alchemist, or Rosicru - cian, regather s the light dispersed or shaken —out of its old broken forms. Gold is the fl ux of the sunbeams or of light, suffused invisibly and magica lly into the body of the world. Light is sublimated gold, rescued magically, by invisible stellar attraction, out of th e material depths. Gold is thus the deposit of light, which of itself generates. Light in the celestial world, is subtle, va porous, magically exalted gold, or “spirit of flame. ” Gold draws and compels inferior natures in the metals, and , intensifying and multiplying, converts into itself. It is a part of the first -formed “Glory ” or “Splendour, ” of which all objects and all souls are points or parts. Gassendus asserts t hat when the Rosicrucians teach that the “Divinity ” is the “Light ” or the “Realisation of Creation, ” displayed from the beginning ( A ) to the end ( W ) of the whole visibl e or comprehensible frame, they mean that the Divine Bei ng is not possible or existent, according to human idea, unless “He, ” or the “Original Light ” is manifested or expressed in some special “com - prehensible ” oth er light or form.

This second light, or Anima Mundi , is “Manifestation, ” or the “Son as proceeding from the Father. ” This synthesis is the light, * breath, life, aura, or Sacred Spirit. It is the s olar or golden alchemical soul, which is the sustainment and perfection of every thing. * The pendulum of the world beats betw een inspiration and expiration. This is the breath of t he angels, who “burn and glow ” (scriptural expression), in the pulsative ac cess and re -inforcement of the “soul of the world. ” This “breath of the angels ” is made human in the mechanism of the heart, and is et ernal; but becomes personal and limited in the “world of man ”—down, in inhala tion, to a point, and up , in exhalation, from that point.

They aver that the Bible is the story of heavenly things put for ward in a way that can be alone comprehensible by man, and that without their Cabala, and the parables in which they have chosen to invest its revelati on, not religion only, but even familiar Nature, — the Nature of Things and of Men — is unintelligible.

The princip les and gr ounds for concluding that there may be such an art possibl e as alchemy we shall sum up as follows. Firstly, it is assum ed that every metal consists of mercury as a common versatile and flexible base, from which all metals spring, and into which t hey may be ultimately reduced by art. Secondly, t he species of metals, and their specific and essential forms , are not subject to transmuta - tion, but only the indiv iduals; in other words, what is general is abstract and invisible, what is particular is con- crete and visible, and therefore can be acted upon. Thirdly, all metals differ, not in their common nature and matter, but in their degree of pe rfection or purity towards that invisible “light ” within everything, or celestial “glory ” or base for objects , which has “matter ” as its mask. Fourthly, Art surmo unteth and transcendeth Nature; for Art, directed upon Natur e, may in a short while perfect that which Nature by itsel f is a thousand years in accom - plishing. Fifthly, God hath created every metal of i ts own kind, and hath fixed in them a principle of growth, especi - ally in the perfect metal g old, which is the master of the material, and which in itse lf has magnetic seed, or magic light, an unseen and heavenly power, unknown in this world, but which c an by ar t be evoked, be made to inspire and multiply and take in all matter. It is said of the alchemic al philosophers, that no sooner did they attain this precious “Stone ” or “Power, ” than the very knowledge of it, in the magic surprise at its existence, delighted them more than a ught that the world could give. They made greater use of it i n its supernatural effects upon the human body than in t urning it upon the base matter, to make “gold ” of this latt er which they treated with con - tempt. And in answe r to those who would ask what was the reason that those suppos ed greatest of all philosophers did not render themselves a nd their friends rich by a pro - cess so speedy and thoro ugh, it was rejoined, that they wanted not, that they were satisfied in the pos session of the"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 316 ability, that they lived in the m ind, that they rested satisfied in theory and declined pract ice, that they were so overcome and astonished at the imm ensity of the power accorded by God ’ s grace to man, that they disdained to become gol d - makers to the greedy, or sup pliers to the possible idle and mischievous needy, and t hat they were afraid to be mad the prey and sacrifice of avarici ous, cruel tyrants; which would be but too surely their fate if they were, through vain - glory, or tempta tion, or avoidable effects of force, to make known their wondrous gifts, or to dis close or betray the fact of the supernatu ral method of their existence — clearly at the safest in being disbelieve d, and being looked upon as lie or delusion.

We understand not what they are; or how they are; or why they are. Indeed — penetrating down to this truth — we know not why WE ourselves exist, or what we ARE .

But the dangers resulting from the abuse of these amiable pleasures are much more formid - able. Pp. 38 , 39 , of Curiositates Erotica Physiologies ( 1875 ). Woman’s physical constitution adapts her for love. But (until prove n) she is rigid, and to a certain extent (like virgins usually) insensate, and even rebelliously irresponsive. All the “ pittoresques ” to the number of twelve, invented by the Greek Courtesan, Cyrene, as being the best in which to signalise that particular loving mystery, which has every - thing (enjoined) under it; all those enchanting modes of sympathy which Phyleiris and Ashyanase published, which Elephaseus composed in Leonine verse, and which after - wards the Roman Emperor, Nero, caused to be painted on the Walls of the Imperial Banquetting -Hall, in his famous Golden Palace, by the first artists of Rome, all these prove that women are much better adepts in the ars amandi and its mysteries, than men —that they have a much keener relish for its intricacies, t o which they deliver themselves up— with the chosen object —with a delight and abandon unknown to man. In short, in all the solicitation of love, women are the most inventive, assiduous, intense and persevering. Catherine the Second of Russia pos sessed boundless power. She set no limits to her gratification in the sensual respect. She was imperial and magnificent in her luxurious enormities. Her will was law, she was the “modern Messalina;” she richly earned the title which was accorded to her of literally being (no small distinction"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 324 in its way) “la pi u futatrice nel mondo. ” But, on the other hand, there were wonderful contradictions to this state of irregular eagerness. Maria (Mariana) Coanel, wife of Juan de la Cerda, not being able to bea r the absence of her husband, preferred committing suicide to yielding to the otherwise irresistible temptations of the flesh — as she found them in their occasional assaults. The extraordinary un - consciousness and ignorance of some women is remarkable — ho wever rare; especially in these, in some respects, scarcely modest, all - knowing times. Isabella Gonzaga, the wife of the Duke of Urbino, passed two years with her husband still remaining a virgin; and so great was her ignorance of the matrimonial usage, t hat, until enlightened, she had imagined all married women lived as she lived; and she received the new knowledge in all simplicity. Greek pictorial and statuary art was suffused with ideas of matchless and of immortal beauty. The curves and undulation o f form, the enchanting and enchanted art which peopled Grecian landscapes with shapes of ravish - ment and Greek temples with wonders: — the eye that saw, the hand that traced, the taste that toned, the delicacy that softened — all was exquisite, all was succes sful. The most intensely poetical and subduing * (nay, the most religious, moving one to tears), and the most gloriously beautiful object in the whole universe is the undraped form of a woman symmetrical. No wonder that the ancients made a woman (thus) a n object of idolatry. In the excess — in the superexcelling — of their refinement, other ideals were reached. † The “Sexes” were “Two.” But “Beauty” * Difficult to understand — but true. The reason may be — sorrow that such a glorious object — Divinity’s handiwork, as a “present” to Man — should perish. Reflect upon note immediate ly following. † Beauty became bifurcated (so to express), and irregular; heated as it were into a sinister — a devilish ( forbidden ) temptation, for passion of taste. Excess, or a deviating superflux or overdoing, of desire supervened. Longing became deliri ous : because “Lucifer,” or the “Lost One” — “Unchastened Presumption” — had passed his lightning - like availing spear of apotheosising enchanted tempting D EATH through the transmuted “huma n female body;” advanced and ad dressed in its snaring graces to Hell’s perfectness."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"THE ARTS SUBSERVING MYTHOLOGY. 325 was “One.” Beards have nought of beauty, apart from strength. Beards are barbarous —hence their name. Hair is of the beasts, “ excrementa; ” “ tentacula .” The Greek artists exercised their talents in the production of a kind of beauty mixed of that of the “Two Sexes,” merging and blending the softness and enchanting shapeliness of the one with the aggressive pict uresque roundness and boldness of the other. Each (separate) was the acmé of picturelike propriety and grace. But the third “Thing” was a “New Thing” —otherwise a miracle —a new sensation. Hence Paris, hence Adonis, hence Ganymede, hence the loves of Sal macis and Hermaphroditus, hence the “feminine” Bacchus, hence Hylas —hence these deities, in tresses, of neither sex, and yet of both. Greek art in this respect presents a phenomenon. As a phenomenon we must recognise and regard it. The flower is supra -natural , treasonous, and abhorrent. It is “a flower of Hell.” Nevertheless, it is a “flower.” And thus the idea domi - nates the alternate “ shaded ” and “ shining ” halves of the whole world; of all art; of all philosophy; of all RELIGION . Philosophy must n ot ignore, or affect not to see, or decline hypocritically, or too nicely (not wisely), to consider these powerful —these ALL - POWERFUL —factors. This whole round of subjects intimately refers to the Rosicrucians, and to their supposed “unintelligible” belief s. They are intel - ligible enough to the “knowing ones;” but they are not to be divulged. The most difficult problem of the Greek artists was to exercise their talent in the production of a kind of beauty mixed with that of the Two Sexes, and time has spar ed some of the masterpieces. Such is the figure known undee the name of the Hermaphrodite ( Hermes -Aphrodite ; Venus - Mercury ). In the classic times, both amongst the Greeks and Romans, as also in Oriental countries, a cruel and flagi - tious violation of natu re (not supposed -so; even accepted as sacred) produced this beauty by enforcing sacrifice of a peculiar kind on young male victims.

The most extraordinary ideas as to the origin of the human race have been entertained by speculativ e thinkers, and by theologians. The celebrated William Law believed that the First Human Being was a creature combining the characteristics of both sexes in his own individual person. “God created man in His own Image. In the Image of God created He, hi m.” Some controversionists consider that there is a LONG space due (but not allowed) between the foregoing and the succeeding: — “Male and Female created He THEM .” “Increase and multiply, and replenish the earth.” This command was given on the Sixth Day. Eve was not created until the Seventh Day. Hence Eve must have been born of Adam * — or separated from him. Admitting, moreover, that the term “Day.” — as used in Genesis — is employed to express an indefinite period of time, in order to form Woman, God depri ved Adam of his androgyne character, and reduced him to a Being having one sex only. And here steps in a fanciful idea of some speculative thinkers; which (however extravagant) is very poetical and beautiful. They ask in specifying the question — in serious truth a not - altogether improbable conjecture — whether the irresistible inclination and the otherwise mysterious, unac - countable drawing - together and sympathy of two persons who meet for the first time and find themselves mutually charmed (they cannot tell how or why); — or who even * “Ejus autem imago ea est quæ exhibetur, ore videlicet excellentis - simo , ut sunt Arnobii verba, et specie inter virginem et puerum eximia.

Others maintai ned that Adam and Eve were each of them, separately, an Hermaphrodite. Other Jewish authorities, among whom are Samuel Manasseh and Ben -Israel, are of opinion that our Great Progenitor was created with Two Bodies, and that “ H E ” separated them afterwards d uring Adam’s sleep; an opinion founded by these writers upon the second chapter of Genesis, verse 21 : the literal tran - slation of the Hebrew being: —“He (God) separated the Woman from his side, and substituted Flesh in her place.” This idea resembles that of Plato. Origen, St. Chrysostom, and St. Thomas believed that the.Woman was not created till the Seventh Day. But the most generally received opinion is, that Adam and Eve were created on the Sixth. These particular notions —extravagant as they must be ad - mitted to be —as to the original “single -dual, dual -single” characteristics of Adam and Eve are eminently Platonic — nay, cabalistic. Plato proceeds to account for the love which some men have for some women, and vice versâ . “The males,” he says, “whic h are halves of an Androgyne, are much given to women; and the women, which are the halves of an Androgyne, are passionately fond of men. As for the women” (a not uncommon case) “who indulge an inclination for their own sex, they are the halves of the And rogyne females who were doubled, and the men who exhibit a liking for other men are the halves of the males who were also doubled. In the beginning there were three kinds of Human Beings, not only the Two which still exist (namely, the Male and the Femal e)—but a Third, which was composed of the Two First.” Of this last sex — or kind —nothing remains but the tradition, and the name. “The Androgynes, for so they were called, had not only both the male and female faces, but also possessed the sexual distincti ons of both. Of these creatures, likewise, nothing now exists but the name, which survives as a stigma, and which is considered infamous . * The reason assigned for the different shape of these three kinds was that the males * Nature has made this, the fact; as “out of” nature."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 330 were formed by the Sun; the fe males by the Earth; and the mixed race of Androgynes by the Moon; — which par - takes both of the Sun and the Earth.” Ecclesiastical writers declare that such an Eunuch was the Holy Evangelist, St. John, whom Jesus loved beyond all His other disciples, who l ay upon Jesus’ bosom; who, while Peter tardily advanced, flew, borne on the wings of virginity, to the L ORD ; and, penetrating into the secrets of the Divine Nativity, was emboldened to declare what preceding ages had been ignorantof. “In the Beginning w as the Word.

Is M AN alone in his world? Are there O THERS in it with him? The ancients universally held virginity as a real magic, transcendental, mysterio us something, which exercised power supernaturally both through Heaven and through Earth. It was an unnatural - natural outspring set apart and sacred “of the Gods.” None but the barbarous touch, the brutal touch, could profane it. It worked miracles. “ ’Tis said that the Lion will turn and flee From a Maid in the pride of her purity.” For maidhood and virginity is a phenomenon independent of Creation, and bears through the worlds — visible and in - visible — the worlds immortal — the impress and seal upon i ts forehead of G OD ’ S R EST , not of His A CTIVITY .

They are fivefold in their exercise or delimitation. God is indeed identical with this supreme spirit.

The true Cabalistæ are none other than alchemists and Rosicrucians. Likewise the Magi, Wise Men, Philosophers, Priests, and Heroes; from Jason and the “Three Kings” to King Arthur, and from Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses, to Numa, Para - celsus, Borrichius, Robertus de Fluctibus (nearer our own time), AND OTHERS . The Rosicrucian system took the following forms: — These Philosophers believed that there were Two Prin - ciples in the Beginning — Light and Darkness, or Form and the Material out of which the Form was. That before the Creation (distinctively so called), the Light Itself was as “Div inity Latent,” or “At Rest.” In the Creation, or in the production of things, Divinity became active, aroused, and inventive. By whatever name distinguished, or by whatever style identified, Moses’ description of Creation is to be taken as the process o f Alchemy, as worked by Nature itself, being her Form; to which head are referred the king - doms of darkness, or chaos, and the Light emerging out of its own bosom or D ARKNESS . After the active movement from the centre, or evolve - ment, or Creation, the rad iation and counterworking or interchange of Light and Darkness in crossing and encoun - tering irritated mutually, naturally; became expansive and contractive angularly — thence pyramidal and starry. And in the relative counterbalancing con temp eration, the diver - sity of things arose at the points of the masterdom into form or Light.

Light emanates in the Sephiroth (“ CABALA ”) or “Sevenfold” rotation — hence the “p roduction of phenomena.” In uniting with the Ethereal Spirit, it becomes the Soul, or “Responsive Sentience of the World.” The further elucidation of the Rosicrucian theological system, in its general features — so far as in hint or parable submitted to unenlightened comprehen- sion —will be found pre -stated at Page 208 , and elsewhere. The Rosicrucians contend that music, or melody — which is enchantment —pervades all nature in its prosperous or intended progress, although it is only the wail, or plaint, of t he instinctive soul on its “wounded,” or “sacrificed,” or “ Ruined Side. ” It mourns for its “Original Lost Para - dise.” The music of the spheres is no unreal thing, but real as is the atmosphere of the spirits; for “music is the atmosphere of the spirits, ” and discords (though the neces - sity, support, and balance of Creation) are a medium for the coarse and low spirits, who inundate, as it were, the lees and the settlings of nature. In discords, or in the inharmonious strife amidst the sounds, the rabble of the spirits (so to term them) are stimulated to their envious and spiteful, or malific or freakish and blundering, bad life. Beauty is not, however, necessarily beauty —it may be seduction . For the higher grades of the recusant or rebel - lious spirits who find their power in the original permission that there “might be phenomena” are beautiful in their assumption —or usurpation —of the lovely forms of spirit - life and of nature.

In process of time the Hindoos appear to have adopted a material type or emblem of Brühm. A rude block of stone began to be set up. This was the “ Phallus ,” or, as they termed it, the “ Linga .” This emblem had reference to the Procreati ve Power seen throughout nature, and in that primaeval age was regarded with the greatest awe and veneration. This simple and primitive Idolatry came by degrees to diverge into the adoration of the elements, particularly Fire, and at length developed itse lf by the institution of an emanation from Brühm Atma in his Triune capacity, as Creator, Preserver (or “Saviour”), and Destroyer. These attributes were deified under the names of Brahma , Vishnu , and Siva , on whom were conferred three gunas, or qualities, viz., Rajas (passion), Sat (purity), and Tumas (darkness). This is the Trimurti . “Trimurti, ‘three -formed’ ” Murti , signi - fying also an image. Our vital souls are, according to the Vedanta, no more than images, or eidwla of the “Supreme Spirit” —As.

The Brahmins say that the other Gods are good and benevolent, and will not hurt their creatures ; but that Siva is powerful and cruel, and th at it is necessary to appease him. As fear is, and must be everywhere, the most potent feeling. Thence vital and active physical religion. Distrust and fear of the external phenomena of the world, as meaning mischief to us (it means the greatest —apparen tly —in Death), created religion.

This emblem is identical with Siva in his capacity of “Lord of All.” It is necessary, however, to observe that Professor Wilson, while admitting that “the Linga is perhaps the most ancient object of homage adopt ed in India” adds “subsequently to the ritual of the Vedhas , which was chiefly, if not wholly, addressed to the Elements, and particularly to Fire. How far the worship of the Linga is authorised by the Vedhas is doubtful, but that it is the main purport o f several of the Puranas * there can be no doubt.” † The universality of Linga puja , (or worship) at the period of the Mahommedan invasion of India is well at - tested. The idol destroyed by Mahmoud of Ghizni, was nothing more than one of those mystical bloc ks of stone called Lingas. The worship of Siva under the type of the Linga is almost the only form in which that Deity is reverenced. The Linga of black or white marble, and sometimes of alabaster slightly tinted and gilt, ‡ is placed in the middle of the Hindü temples. Speaking of Siva and Pawáti, M. de Langlet says, “Les deux divinités dont - il s’agit, sont très souvent et très pieusement adordes sous le figure du Linga (le Phallus des anciens), et de 1’Yoni, dans leur mystérieuse conjonction.

It is a singular fact, that upon this adoration of the procreative and sexual Sacti (or power) seen throughout nature, hinges the whole strength of the Hindü faith. No twithstanding all that has been said by half -informed and prejudiced persons to the con - trary, this puja does not appear to be prejudicial to the morals of the people. Nearly all the Pujas are conducted with the frequent ringing of bells, and the object of this is twofold —first to wake up the attention at particular parts of the service; and secondly, to scare away malignant Dewtas and evil spirits; precisely, in fact, for the same reasons as they are used at the celebration of Mass in Roman Catholic coun tries. Prakriti, * the mother of gods and men, one with matter, the source of error, is identified with Maya or delusion, and co-existent with the Omnipotent, as his Sacti, his personi - fied energy, his bride.

It teaches Materialism, and the Atomic System of the “Confluence of Chance.” Compare the Ananda Tantram, c. xvii. with Lucretius, lib. iii.

This Sanscrit word is in the dialects pronounced Jogi and Zogee , and is equivalent to a secular nun, as these women are subsequently supported by alms. The leading rites of the Sakti - Sodhana are described in the Devi - Radhasya , a section of the Rudra - Yámala . It is therein enjoined that the object of worship should be either — “A dancing - girl, a female devotee (or nun), a courtesan, a Dhobee woman, a barber’s wife, a female of the Brahmi nical or Sudra tribe, a flower - girl, or a milkmaid.” Appropriate muntras are to be used. She is to be solemnly placed naked (as a sacred, un - approachable “Thing” or object), but richly ornamented with jewels and flowers — the triumphant spoils of glorious nature — on the left of a circle (inscribed for the purpose), with muntras and gesticulations. The circle, or vacant enchanted space, must be rendered pure by re - peated incantations and rites; being finally baptized with wine by the peculiar mantra . The Sacti is now sublimised or “apotheosised;” but if not previously initiated, She is to be farther made an adept by the communication of the radical Mantra or last charm whispered thrice in her ear, when the object of the ceremony is complete. The finale to this solemnity is what might be concluded as likely, but — strange to say — accompanied throughout by muntras and forms of meditation and of devotion incomprehensibly foreign to the scene. In other aspects this presentation of the “Yogini” is a “ Sacrifice ” and the whole meaning of the rites is sacrificial - rites performed before an altar and implying — superstition undoubtedly — but deep mystery and some profoundest suggestions.

Wilson, on Hin. Sects, vol. xvii., As. Res. Ward, on the Vaisnavas , p. 309 . In Gregory's Works (“Gregory's Not es and Observations upon several difficult passages in Scripture” —vol. 1 . 4 to. London, 1684 ) is to be found a significant comment — “Noah prayed daily in the Ark before the body of Adam,” * i.e. , before the P HALLUS , or Regenerator (Adam being the primitive “P hallus,” or great Procreator of the Human Race) —(under its present circumstances, and in the exist - ing dispensation). “The body of Adam was embalmed and transmitted from father to son, till at last it was delivered up by Lamech into the hands of Noah.” A gain, the “ middle of the Ark ” was the place of prayer (and worship) made holy by the presence of “Adam’s ‘Body.’ ”—Gregory, p. 121 . “And ‘ so soon as ever the day began to break ,’ Noah stood up towards the ‘body of Adam,’ ” &c., &c., “and ‘prayed’ (or ‘w or- shipped’).” Here was the origin of the “Eucharist,” as the reader will clearly see farther on. (See accompanying plate.) The most ancient monuments of Idolatry among the Gentiles were consecrated pillars (Lingas), or columns, which the Jews were forbid den to erect as objects of divine homage and adoration. And yet —a most extraordinary lines on the forehead, with ashes obtained if possible from the hearth, on which a consecrated f ire is perpetually maintained. * “It may possibly seem strange,” Gregory says, “that this orison should be daily said before the body of Adam; but it is a most con - fessed Tradition among; the Eastern men that Adam was commanded by God that his dead body sh ould be kept above ground till a fulness of time should come to commit it {RALASSWYP to the middle of the earth by a priest of the Most High God.” Pp. 120 , 121 . This “middle of the earth” is Mount Moriah —the Meru of India."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 352 contradiction — this practice is conceived to arise from an imitation of Jacob, who “took a stone” and “set it up,” &c. Further — “this stone was held in great veneration i n subsequent times by the Jews and removed to Jerusalem.” They were accustomed to “anoint this stone;” and from the word Bethel, the place where the pillar was erected, came the word Bœtylia among the Heathen, which signi - fied rude stones, or uprights, w hich they worshipped either as “symbols of Divinity,” or as “true gods,” animated (at certain times) by the heavenly power. Thence the name “Bowing Stones” amongst the Welsh — not as stones to be “bowed - to,” but “bowing of themselves,” like the modern “tipp ing - discs” or other supposed enchanted idols or con - sultative tables or objects. Indeed, it would seem not improbable that the erection of the Pillar of Jacob actually gave rise to the worship of Phallus among some of the Pagan peoples. “For,” says Lewis , “the learned Bochart asserts that the Phœnicians (at least as the Jews think) first worshipped this very stone which Jacob set up, and after - wards consecrated others in imitation and in reminder of it.” It is to little purpose that we are reminded that t he Jews were forbidden by their law to “make unto themselves any graven image;” for, as Lewis shows in the following pas - sage, there may be exceptions to this, as to every other general rule. “Notwithstanding,” he says, “the severity of the Law against the making of Images, yet, as Justin Martyr observes in his Book against Trypho, it must be somewhat mysterious, that God in the case of the ‘Brazen Serpent’ * should command an image to be made, for which * The “Brazen Serpent” continued to be worshipped by the Jews, and to have incense offered to that Idol, till the “reign of Hezekiah: — “For it being written in the Law of Moses, ‘whosoever looks upon it shall live,’ they fancied they might obtain blessings by its mediation, and therefore thought it worthy to be worshipped. Our learned Dr. Jackson observes, ‘that the pious Hezekiah was moved with the greater indignation against the worship of this image, because in truth it never was — nor was intended to be — a type of our Saviour, but a figu re of His Grand Enemy,” &c. The Jews relapsed into idolatry by the adoration of the Golden Calf; set - up, too, not by a few schismatics, but by the entire people, with Aaron at their head. The Calf - superstition was doubtless a relic of what they had seen i n Egypt in the worship of Apis and Mnevis."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"TRADITIONS CONCERNING THE “ ARK. ” 353 “one of the Jews confessed he never could hear a re ason from any of their Doctors.” According to Theodoret, Arnobius, and Clemens of Alexandria, the Yoni (then become Ioni; thence Ioina and Ionic ) of the Hindus was the sole object of veneration in the Mysteries of Eleusis (“Demosthenes on the Crown”). Next we have the ‘Golden Calves’ set -up by Jeroboam at Dan and Bethel. Then follows (Judges viii. 22 , &c.) the worship of Gideon’s Ephod. “The Ephod made by Gideon with the spoil of the Midian - ites became afte r his death an object of idolatry” (Ibid. p. 41 ). We have also Micah’s images and the “Teraphim.” We learn from St. Jerome (who received it by tradition from the ancient Jews, and indeed it is so stated in Numbers xxv. 1 , 2 , &c., —xxiii. 28 , and numerou s other passages of the Old Testament) that the Jews adored Baal Phegor (Baal -Pheor), the Priapus of the Greeks and Romans. “It was,” he says, “principally worshipped by women; colentibitus maxime feminis (Baal -Phegor). Maimonides observes that the ador a- tion offered to this Idol, called Pehor, consisted in discovering —— . Chemosh, probably the same as Baal -Pheor, also received the homage of the Jews, as also did Milcom, Molech, Baal -berith (or Cybele), and numerous others —all of the same sexual cast. From all this in regard to their irregular worship —or rather — (mysteriously) —to their regular or assigned worship, it will be seen that the Jews fell into Idolatry —(and Phallic Idolatry, too) to an extent interpenetrating —again most mysteriously —the whole scope of their religion. There will consequently not appear anything so very startling in the supposition that the Ark of the Covenant contained symbolic objects referring to Phallic ideas. We have seen that the “Stone,” or “Pillar,” of Jacob was held in particular veneration — that it was worshipped and anointed. We know from the Jewish records that the Ark was supposed to contain the tables of stone. And if it can be demonstrated that these stones implied a Phallic reference, and that these “tables” we re identical with the symbolism accompany - ing the sacred name Jehovah, lehovnh, or Yehovah, which, written in unpointed Hebrew, with four letters is —IEVE or IHVH (the H E being merely an aspirate and the same as E) —this process leaves us the two letters I and V (or, in another of its forms, U). Then if we add the I in the U we have the “Holy of Holies,” we also have the Linga and Yoni and Argha (Ark or Arc) of the Hindüs, the “Iswarra” or “Supreme Lord.” In all this may be found —mystically —the “Arc - Cele stial” replicating -in upon itself —symbolically and anagrammatically —and presenting itself as identical with the “Lingayoni” of the “Ark of the Covenant.” Gregory observes that the “ middle of the Ark was the place of prayer —made holy (consecrated) by the presence of Adam’s Body.” (Refer to the glyptic symbolism, the mystical engraving of the “Ark,” facing p. 351 .)

Enfin, après nouvelle consultation, notre Théologien ordonna a la jeune fille de porter sur elle de petites boulettes composées de parfums exquis, tels que musc, ambre, civette, baume de Pérou et autres.

In some general bio - graphies and dictionaries the name of Robert Fludd, Doctor of Medicine, &c., does occur. But the notices concerning his life are very scanty, possibly because there was little material for them existent in his own age. We have, in our studies of the Rosicrucian doctrine, purposely made the life of Dr. Robert Flood an object of close exami nation. We have searched for every possible personal memorial of him. We have been rewarded with, however, but frag - mentary matter. Our information concerning his life is quite the reverse of extensive; notwithstanding our intimacy with his writings.

It was in the afternoon of a summer day that we sought out the village of Bersted, situate a few miles distant from Maidstone in Kent, on the Ashford Road. Flood is buried in the ancient church (a small one) of Ber - sted —a village, or rather hamlet, boasting an assemblage of larger or smaller houses around a green, none of any con - siderable pretension; cottages —neat specimens of English rural cottages they may be called, with small gardens, varying gable s, and crossed lattices. There are woody grounds and picturesque hop -plantations enclosing this quiet, homely -looking place; with its solemn church up an elevation in the corner of this extensive triangular green — with excellent smooth cricket -space in the centre. The church in which he lies! —what words for such a man. To us—or to any Rosicrucian student who knew who he was and what he had done —he was the whole country. His influence extended from, and vivified everything —this, the whole way from the “St ar” —the old inn, or rather hotel, from which we had started in the morning in order to pilot our way thither; —through the quiet country, passing few people and only small groups of cattle straggling along the sunshiny road.

The monument is singularly like Shakspeare’s, even allowing for the pre -"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 362 vailing architectural fashion of the time. There is a seated half - length figure of Flood with his hand on a book, as if just raising his head, from reading, to look at you. The figure is nearly of life - size. There is, moreover, a very strik ing similarity in Dr. Flood’s.grand thinking counten - ance to that of Shakspeare himself, and his brow has all the same breadth, and is as equally suggestive of knowledge and of power. The Church of Bersted is very small and old. The square tower of the ch urch is covered with masses of dark ivy. The grassy ground slopes, with its burial mounds, from about the foundation of the old building towards the some - what distant village of Bersted. The churchyard descends in picturesque inclination, and is divided by a low brick - wall; over which, here and there, flowers and overgrowth have broadly scaled from the garden of the old - fashioned, though neat - looking rustic, picturesque parsonage. There is a winding green lane, with high hedges, which leads down to the village. All is open, and quietly rural. It is true English scenery, homely and still. The large trees, and the Abundance of turfy cover over the whole ground - view, pleases. The rustic impression and the deep country silence befit that spot where one o f the most extraordinary thinkers in the English roll of original men lies at rest. When we were in this neighbourhood, and on the first occasion that we sought out Bersted, it was a calm grey summer’s after - noon. The still clouds, which seemed to prolo ng the grey general haze dwelling on the more distant landscape, were impressive of a happy — quietly happy — repose. And as we stood on our return towards Maidstone — having spent, we believe, upwards of three hours in meditative notice either in the church or musing and strolling round it — the slopes of the hopgrounds presented a field of view of light, lovely green.

We would warn every inquirer to place not the least reliance upon any account which they may meet of Robert Flood in any of the ordinary bio - graphies, or in any Encyclopaedia or other book professing to give an account of the Rosicrucians. We beg the curious not to believe one word —except dates, and scarcely these —that are to be found in accepted scientific treatises, or otherwise, purporting to speak of Flood, or of his compeers. These are all at fault — and ign orant —particularly and generally. Robert Flood was the second son of Sir Thomas Flood, Treasurer of War to Queen Elizabeth. The name was ori - ginally Lloyd, and the family came from Wales. Robert Flood was born at Milgate House, of which edifice, one corne r still remains built in the manor -house which was erected on its site when the old house fell to ruin. Milgate House is situated near Bersted. Flood was born in the year 1574 . He was entered at St. John's College, Oxford, in 1591 . He travelled for s ix years in France, Spain, Italy, and Germany. He was a member of the College of Physi - cians, London. He was M.B., M.D., B.A.,and M.A. The latter degree he took in 1605 . He began to publish in 1616 . He died at his house in Coleman Street, London, in the year 1637 . Flood is also stated by Fuller to have lived in “Fanchurch” Street. The list of Flood’s works comprise the following: — 1 . “Utriusque cosmi, majoris scilicet et minoris, Physica, Metaphysica atque Technica Historia.” Oppenheim, 1617 - 19 . I n Two Volumes, Folio. 2 . “Tractatus Apologeticus integritatem societatis de Rosea -Cruce defendens.” Leyden, 1617 . 3. “Monochordon mundi symphoniarum, seu replicatio ad apologiam Johannis Kepleri.” Francfort, 1620 ."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 364 4 . “Anatomia Theatrum triplici effigie d esignatum.” At the same place, 1623 . 5 . “Philosophia Sacra et vere Christiana, seu Meteorologia Cosmica.\" At the same place, 1626 . 6 . “Medicina Catholica, seu, Mysteritim Artis Medicandi Sacrarium.” The same, 1626 . 7 . “Integrum Morborum Mysterium.” The same, 1631 . 8 . “Clavis Philosophic et Alchymiae.” The same, 1633 . 9 . “Philosophia Mosaica.” Gondse, 1638 . 10 .”Pathologia Dasrnoniaca.” The same, 1640 . The above account of Flood's Rosicrucian works is from “Fuller’s Worthies.” There are notices of Dr. Flood in the “ Athena et Fasti Oxoniensis ,” in Chalmers’ “Biographical Dictionary” under the names of “Flood,” “Mersenne,” and “Gassendi,” in Granger’s “Celebrated Characters,” and in Renaudot — “ Conferences Publiques ,” tom. iv. page 87 . Also in Brucker. Upo n Flood’s monument there are two marble - books bearing the following titles: — “Misterium Cabalisticum,” and “Philosophia Sacra.” There were originally eight books represented in all; “studding” the front of the tablet (as the look of it may be described). The inscription to his memory is as follows : - —— “viii. Die. Mensis vii. A°.Dm., M . D . C .

A work of Gassendi's bearing the title — “Epistolica Exercitatio, in qua precipua principia philosophiæ Roberti Fluddi deteguntur, et ad recentes illius libris adversus patrem Marinum Mersennum scriptos respondetur,” — was printed at Paris in 1628 . This piece was reprinted in the third volume of Gassendi's works published at Paris in 1658 , under the title of “Examen Philosophiæ Fluddanæ,”"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"THE SOCIETY SECRET AND UNKNOWN. 365 &c. Flood wrote two books against Mersennus, who had assailed his philosophy. The title of the first book was —“Sophia cum moria certamen, in quo lapis Lydius a falso structore Patre Marino Mersenno, monacho repro - batus, voluminis sui Babylonici in Genesi figurata accurate - examinat.” This work was published in Folio at Francfort in 1629 . The name of the second book was —“Sum - mum bonorum, quod est verum magiæ, Cabalæ, Alchymiæ, Fratrum Ros æ-Crucis Virorum, subjectura indictanim scien - tiarum laudem, in ins ignis calumniatoris Fr. Man Mersenni dedecus publicatum, per Joachim Frizium, 1629 . In this Book, which we now bring to a close in its Second Edition, we have traced and expounded the philosophy of the authentic Rosicrucians, as developed in the folios of the celebrated Dr. Flood —“Robertus de Fluctibus” We are the first Author who has brought forward Flood’s name to the reading world, justified his claims, and made him known through the most laboured and long -studied trans - lation with continual reference to hundreds of books in all languages, dead and living, which bore reference to Flood’s sublimest philosophical speculations. All the world has heard of the Rosicrucians —few or none have ever taken the trouble to ascertain whether the stupendous and appa - rently audacious claims of these philosophers were rightly or wrongly estimated —that is, whether to be adjudged as founded on the rock of truth, or seeking steadiness and root only in the sands of delusion. The Author began his inqui - ries, in the year 1850 , in a spirit of the utmost disbelief; thus taught by the world's assumptions and opinions. Much of this indoctrinated preoccupation the wise man has to unlearn in his progress through life. Fogs, and prejudices, and prepossessions cleared from the Au thor’s mind as he advanced. After the very considerable space of twenty -eight years of study of the Rosicrucians, the author of this work ends: —( as he ends.)

The story of the Rosicrucians is of the widest interest. The proof of this fact lies in the accumulation of letters from pe rsons in every condition of life addressed to the Authors of the present work since the publication of the First Edition from all parts of the world; anonymously, or with particulars of names, &c. The celebrated author of the “Confessions of an English Opi um Eater” (Thomas de Quincey), in his “Historico - Critical Inquiry into the Origin of the Rosicrucians and the Free - Masons,” originally published in the London Magazine of January 1824 , also continued in the succeeding number, has this remarkable passage: “ Rosicrucianism is not Free - masonry. The exoterici , at whose head Bacon stood, and who afterwards composed the Royal Society of London, were the antagonist party of the Theosophists, Cabbalists, and Alchemists. At the head of whom stood Fludd; and from wh om Freemasonry took its rise.” Thus we leave the Rosicrucians — as men — (just as we ought to leave them) — in the same mystery as that state of really impenetrable mystery in which we find them.

The Post - Diluvian “Signs of the Zodiac” are here correctly designated as in number \" Twelve.\" Let the judicious Reader remark that twelve times thirty are Three - Hundrecl - and - Sixty, w hich is not the number of the degrees of this symbolical plan. There are twelve divisions in this ark. The centre space is that through which the “Dove” or “Raven,” escaped - out into the “open” in search of its new home, or into the restored world when th e waters “went down” or “disappeared.” Each of the twelve spaces in the accompanying plan contains twenty - five degrees which make an aggregate of three hundred degrees. The mythical figure contained in the Ark is presumably that of Noah. It is also e vidently the symbolical figure of the “Saviour,” and typically only that of Noah; for the hands are “crossed,” and the feet and hands bear the marks of the “Incision” — the “Nails of the Crucifixion (or Passion).” Twenty - five, the number of the degrees in each space or sign of this “Noachic Ark,” Arca, or Chest (Gigantic), are the number of the Knights of the Garter; with the reserved “twenty - sixth,” or Kingly or Sovereign Seat. In this respect the ark may be regarded as the grand mythic “Idea” of the “R ound Table;” as that was the production of the central mythic “Idea” of the “Sangreal” or “Sangrail.” — Refer to Engraving at p . 351 , and the Rosicrucian com - ment upon the same .

T HE S ANG -R ËALE , G RËAL , O R H OLY G RËALE . T HE engraving at p. 340 gives the mystical idea, or suggestion, of the Round Table of the Knights of King Arthur, which is again typical of the San Grëal. The romance of Guyot, or at least the traditional fable of the San Grëal , spread over France, Germany, and England. In the. twelfth century the dogma of transubstantiation not being yet defined by the Church, the chalice, the mark of the Knights Templars, had not the deep mystic meaning which it received in the following century. The graal signifies a vase . The San Grëal is identified with the vessel, in which Jesus celebrated the Holy Supper, and which also was used to receive His Blood flowing from the wound inflicted upon Him by the centurion Longinus. Walter Mapes, the historian of the San Grëal, ascribes to it a supernatural origin. He gave out that God was its real author, and had revealed it, in a celestial v ision, to a holy hermit of Britain towards the year A . D . 720 . This writer makes Joseph one of the coryphæi of his history of the San Greal. After forty -two years of captivity, Joseph of Arimathea, the guardian of the Grail or Grëal, is at last set at li berty by the Emperor Vespasian. In possession of the sacred vessel, and a few more relics, and accompanied by his relations and disciples, Hebron and Alain the Fisherman, he travels over a part of Asia, where he converts Enelach, King of Sarras. He then goes to Rome, and thence to Britain, where he preaches the gospel and performs thirty -four miracles. He settles in the Island “ Yniswi - trin ,” Isle of Glass (the Greal is of emerald, and consequently green), or Glas tonbury, where he founds an Abbey (Glast onbury Abbey), and institutes the Round Table (Arthur did this), in imitation of the Holy Supper, which was partaken -of at a “Round Table” with the Twelve Disciples in their mythical double -places , twenty -four in all, and with the double chief -seat, or “ca thedra,” for the President, or the “Saviour.” Lastly, the apostle of the Britons builds a palace, in which he preserves his precious relics, the Sacred Cup (refused to the Laity as a commu - nion), which takes the name of San Greal, the bloody spear (the “u pright” of the St. George’s Cross, to whom the “Garter” is dedicated), with which the centurion Longinus pierced the side of the Lord, from whence issued “blood and water” —the Rosicrucian heraldic colours (royal), Mars —Red; Luna —Argent (or “Fire” and “Wate r”). There are Eight Angels, one to each half -heaven, or dark or light sides, guarding the Four Corners of the World. The Sacred Cup is identified with the vessel of the Holy Supper. The Templars are the successors of the Knights of the Round Table. T heir successors again were the Knights of Malta, with their Eight '”Langues,” or Nations —each represented in a blade of, or ray, of the Eight -pointed RED Templar Cross."},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"THE ROSICRUCIANS . 37 0 The Temple Church, London, was dedicated to St. Mary. The Grëal is a sort of oracle. It is, so to speak, at the orders of the “Mother of God,” to execute all “Her” commands. Parsival — the German champion - hero — thinks of transporting the Greal to the East, from whence it originally came. He takes the San Grëal, embarks at Marseilles with the Templars, and arrives at the court of his brother Feirifix in India. The Sacred Cup manifests a desire that Parsival should remain possessor of the “Grëal,” and only change his name into that of Prester John (Prestre, or Pretre, Jehan, or John). Pars ival and the Templars settle in India. After the disappearance of the Grëal in the West, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, losing the “central object,” or the “Rose” (Rosicrucianism) of the Table, go on a scattered (Knight - Errant or romant ic) championship in search of it. They travel over the world - but in vain. They can - not find the “Grëal.” For it is for ever hidden in the far “East,” or in the land of the “Sun.” Wolfram von Eschenbach tells us that Meister Guyot - le - Provengal found at Toledo an Arabian book, written by an astrologer named Flegetanis, containing the story of the mar - vellous vase called “Greal.” The sacred vase, or the San Greal, was placed, according to the myth of Guyot, in a Temple (or Chapel), guarded by Knights Templeis or Templois (Knights Templars). The Temple of the Greal was placed upon a mountain in the midst of a thick wood. The name of this mysterious mountain (like the Mount Meru of the Hindoos and Olympus of the Greeks) hints sublimity and secrecy. Guyot calls it Mont Salvagge , wild or inaccessible mountain (or “Holy Way”). The Greal was made of a wonderful “Stone” called Exillis , which had once been the most brilliant jewel in .the “Crown of the Archangel Lucifer” — the gem was emerald (green ; Fri day; the unlucky in one sense, the “sacred” woman’s day in another sense). The “Stone” was brought from heaven (rescue) by Angels, and left to the care of Titurel, the First King of the Greal, who trans - mitted it to Amfortas, the Second King, whose siste r “ Herze ” - loïde was the mother of Parsival, the Third King of the San Greal. (These are the Three Kings of Cologne, or the Three Magi or Astrologers.) A great many towns pretended to possess this holy relic. In 1247 the Patriarch of Jerusalem sent th e San Grëal to King Henry the Third of England, as having belonged to Nicodemus (see the “Gospel of Nicodemus”) and Joseph of Arimathea. The inhabitants of Con - stantinople, about the same time, also fancied that a vessel which they had long esteemed as a sacred relic was the San Grëal. The Genoese also felt certain that their santo catino (Catillo: v. a. (L.) “to lick dishes;” Catinus , i. m. (L.) “a dish”) was nothing else than the San Grëal. The same (or similar) modifications of the myth are to be noticed in a romance, in prose, entitled “Percival - le - Gallois.” Not only is the Round Table considered in this book as an imita - tion of the \"Holy Supper,\" but the author goes so far as to give it"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"THE “SAN-GRËALE.” 371 the name of San Grëal itself. In the Romance of Mer lin , written towards the end of the thirteenth century, it is said that the Round Table instituted by Joseph in imitation of the Holy Supper was called “Graal,” that Joseph induced Arthur’s father to create a third Round Table in honour of the Holy Trinit y. “T HE S AN G RËAL .

The Round Table of King Arthur is a Grand Mythological Synthesis. It is a whole Mythology in itself. It is perennial. It is Christian. By tradition, the Round Table of King Arthur devolves from the very earliest period. The illustration opposite page 340 was copied from the original with great care and attention. King Arthur, in the principal seat, is idealised in the person of King Henry the Eighth, in whose time the Round Table is supposed to have been repaired and refaced. In the Revolution, Cromwell's soldiery, after the capture of Winchester, and in the fury at t he imputed idea of idolatry (the Round Table is the English “Palladium “), made a target of it. The marks of many balls are still conspicuous. The five -leaved Roses (Red and White Roses; Rhodion , Rhodes —Knights of Rhodes or of Malta, the successors of the Templars) typify the Ten Original Signs of the Zodiac Red -Rose, Five Signs (Aspiration or Ascension); White -Rose, Five. Signs (or Leaves), Descension (or “Con” -descension, or S.S., or Holy Ghost (the key of the whole apotheosis, according to the mystical Jacob Bœhmen).

This double -rose, “barbed” or “thorned,” Sol, is (in this form) the Tudor Rose (the Rose -en-Soleil , be it remembered, was another of the Tudor badges); denoting the union of the Houses of York and Lan - caster in the person of Harry the Eighth.

This is a truly curious tract upon the “relations of the Jesuits and the Rosicrucians.” A very curious Book upon the subject of the peculiar and fanciful attributed notions of the Rosicrucians, and which drew a large amount of surprised and “left - handed” attention when it first appeared, was that which bore the title, (in its improved edition - published without a dat e): “Comte de Gabalis, ou Entretiens sur Les Sciences Secretes.
