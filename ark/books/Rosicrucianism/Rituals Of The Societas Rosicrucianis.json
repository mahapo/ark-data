The SRIA attracted the membership of a number of talented men in Rosicrucian circles of the 19 th Century, including: Frederick Hockley, the crystal−gazer; Kenneth Mackenzie, compiler of \"The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia\" – and the three founder members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, William Woodman, W. Wynn Westcott, and Samuel Liddell Macgregor Mathers. Lord Lytton (Sir Edward Bulwher−Lytton, author of \"Zanoni\") and Eliphas Levi were both awarded Honorary membership, but there is no evidence they ever attended SRIA meetings. The SRIA worked nine grades in total: four learning grades, Zelator • Theoricus • Practicus • Philosophus • three Teaching grades, Adeptus Minor • Adeptus Major • Adeptus Exemptus • and two Ruling Grades, Magister Templi • Magus. • Of these, the first seven were the only ones that could usually be attained: however, unlike the Golden Dawn, the SRIA made no pretence that Magistri Templi and Magi were mysterious praeterhuman \"Secret Chiefs\". Although both grades could theoretically be awarded on an Honoris Causa basis (e.g. for outstanding lifetime−service to the Rosicrucian Order), they were usually reserved to the senior−most administrators of the Society. For example, William Woodman would have been a Magus, as at one point he was Supreme Magus of the SRIA. So too would have been his deputies, the Senior and Junior Substitute Magi; so to would the \"Chief Adept\", who is mentioned in these ceremonies. It is interesting to note what Kenneth Mackenzie had to say about the Rosicrucian grades in his \"Royal Masonic Cyclopedia\". The \"Zelator\", alternatively known as \"Illuminatus\" or \"Junior\" – mystical name \"Periclinus de Faustis – is a learner only. Foreword 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The \"Theoricus\", or \"Theoreticus\" – mystical name \"Poraius de Rejectis\" – is concerned with the realisation of gold without labour. The \"Practicus\" – mystical name \"Monoceros de Astris\" – is inured to hardship, and finds from other sources the essential sources in the form of coin. The \"Philosophus\" – mystical name \"Pharos Illuminans\" – studies Botany, natural history, and the branches of science. The \"Adeptus Minor\" – mystical name \"Hodos Chamelionis\" – finds the Philosophical Sun, and works marvellous cures. The \"Adeptus Major\" – mystical name \"Sphaere Fortus a Sales\" – finds the Lapidem Mineralis , or Magnet. The \"Adeptus Exemptus\" – mystical name \"Ianus de Aure Campus\" – finds the Philosophers’ Stone, and studies the Qabalah and Natural Magic. The \"Magister Templi\" – mystical name \"Pedemontanus de Rebus\" – possesses the Three Principle Sciences in a perfect degree. Finally, to the \"Magus\" – mystical name \"Luxianus Renaldus de Perfectis\" – nothing is unknown, he possesses superiority and rank over all others, like Moses, Aaron Hermes (Trismegistus) and Hiram (Abiff). Note that unlike the later Golden Dawn there was no \"Neophyte\" grade – it would appear that this was made up for by the fact that all members were Master Masons of at least six months’ standing. SRIA members also had to be believers in the trinitarian Christian faith – hence not all Masons could join. It was also a male only society, there were no Co−Masons or other females – again, unlike the Golden Dawn. The SRIA proved to be popular enough that Masons in America wanted to set up their own branch. This they did – getting a charter from the English order, to found the \"Societas Rosicrucianis in Civitatibus Federatis\" i.e. the Rosicrucian Society in the United States. It is from this \"SRICF\" that the following Rituals derive – they date from around the year 1880. As for these first four rituals themselves – one can make the following observations. They are strikingly different from the Golden Dawn ceremonies for the equivalent grades. Clearly whoever wrote the Golden Dawn Cipher Manuscripts was not deriving them on the SRIA. The ceremonies tell a four part story concerning a member of the original order, Frater Gualdi. Hard at work trying to find the Elixir Vitae, he rang the ceremonial bell in the middle of the night – which announced his success. However, when the other Brethren reached him, he was lying on the floor, apparently dead. The Brethren tried to discover his last secret by consulting the working papers that lay on the bench... The Initiate is therefore put into the role of a Brother trying to piece together Gualdi’s discovery, by investigating Alchemy, Astrology and Astronomy, etc. At the climax of the Philosophus ceremony, the Initiate sees Gualdi return to life – the hymn which is sung at this point giving some telling clues Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in Anglia Foreword 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"as to the real nature of the \"Elixir Vitae\" Alex Sumner.

Over his head and face is thrown a light scarlet veil. The Conductor of Novices is robed in black with a cowl on his head, and taking the left arm of the Aspirant approaches the door leading from the Porch into the Sacred Hall; while the two Heralds stand one on each side of the entrance. Conductor of Novices: I will go unto the Altar of God. The First Herald meeting them at the entrance: To God who giveth joy to my heart. The entrance of the Aspirant into the Sacred Hall is now made in the following order: First Herald and Second Herald, then Conductor of Novices and Aspirant and finally Torch Bearer. Five circuits of the Sacred Hall are made, with the course of the Sun, which the Fraters and Officers are standing, and the following ODE is sung : Ere God the Universe began, in one rude heap all matter lay Which wild disorder over−ran, nor knew the light one glimmering ray While darkness o’er the whole confusion reigned without control Then God arose, his thunders hurl’d, and bade the elements arise In Air he hung the pendant World, and o’er it spread the azure skies; Stars in circles caused to run, and in the centre fixed the sun. Then Man he called forth out of dust, and formed him with a living Soul All things committed to his trust, and made him Lord of all, the whole But yet ungrateful unto heaven he proved, and was from Eden driven. From thence proceeded all our woes, nor could mankind one comfort share Until the Rosicrucians rose and formed another Eden here: Where true pleasure ever reigns, and native innocence regains. Here crystal fountains flow, here naught that’s vile can enter in The Tree of Knowledge here doth grow, whose fruit we taste, yet free from sin While sweet friendship does abound And guardian Angels hover round. At the close of the ODE, the procession halts in front of the Suffragan in the West. Suffragan : Brother Conductor of Novices, what is the desire of this Aspirant? Zelator 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Conductor of Novices: He desires to proceed from darkness into the pure light of knowledge, to learn the secrets and Doctrines of Nature, and discern the wondrous principles by which the Universe is governed. Suffragan: My Brother, your desire is laudable, but we are mortal like yourself, why come to us? Conductor of Novices: Because he believes that among you are practiced many great virtues, and that the growth of ages has added to your store of knowledge. He desires to be received. Suffragan: We appreciate your faith, but must remind you that the road to knowledge is long, and the life of man is short; remember too hat what the heart conceives is not always accomplished. Build not your hopes too high upon our Order. Our aim is true, our desire to be humble, our study to be wise. The Rosaic System left wealth, honour and power to the worldly; pleasure and indolence to the vicious. We cast our lot with the virtuous and the pure, pressing forward in the pursuit of wisdom. Our objects are fraternal aid and encouragement in working out the great problem of life, in the advancement of science, in the propagation of knowledge and in the diffusion of that glorious acclamation \"Glory to God in the Highest and on Earth, Peace, Good−will toward men.\" My Brother, of your faith we are assured, but of your zeal, I demand proof. Conductor of Novices : I am instructed by the Aspirant to say in his behalf that he is ignorant of much pertaining to God, to nature and himself; that he is surrounded with spiritual doubt and darkness; that his search is just and sincere. He desires, he beseeches to be received. Suffragan : You have spoken wisely. A brave heart may seek anything pure of the pure. Zeal in an exalted purpose is most commendable, and with it faith can remove mountains. Prepare then to undergo the elementary tests requires by our Order. Let the Aspirant be conducted to the Gate of Life, and there be unfolded to him the elementary tests, and primary secrets of Nature and Truth. The Aspirant, with the attendants, pass towards the North, then Southward to the front of the 1st Ancient, who places a little clean earth on his lips. 1st Ancient : And the voice of the First Ancient was heard, saying, \"Hearken ye Aspirant.

The Brethren now noiselessly form the Mystic Circle about the Altar and the Aspirant, who is still kneeling, while the Suffragan reads the following: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men. And the Light shineth in the darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not.\" The curtain in the East is withdrawn, revealing the Chief Adept in front of a white covered table, with 33 burning candles upon it; in front of this is an Altar (small) of incense, burning; and above this is suspended a 5−pointed Star (one point up). The Aspirant is caused to rise in front of the Altar on which is the Rose and cross, having the letters I.N.R.I. above the Rose, when the celebrant so directs: Rise, my Brother, and receive the Light of our Mystic Circle. The Conductor removes the veil of obscurity from the Aspirant, while the Brethren thrice strike their arms across the breast . Chief Adept: The Light of the Lord be with you. Celebrant: And with thy Spirit. Worthy Brother, on being restored to a more perfect vision you discover before you the Altar upon which rests the Rose upon the Cross, commemorative of the spotless life of Him whom we believe was the Manifested Glory of God. Behold the initials of that Sacred Name and Title which were traced in burning letters upon the cross of the Redeemer. Treasure in your heart the remembrance of the Word, I.N.R.I., Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judeorum. Forget not that for 33 years he laboured on earth in meekness and humility, a period which is represented by the 33 lights in the East. The Rose, my Brother, alludes to the beauty and grandeur of His Resurrection from the dead, and is typical of the eternal glory of the Rose of Sharon, Ego sum Rosa Sharoni, et Lillium Convallium.

Your passing the 4 Ancients in a serpentine course has a mystical allusion, for you were in search of Wisdom. Be thou as wise as a Serpent. In learning Wisdom seek to be obedient unto the Law, for all its paths are peace. The Conductor of Novice invests the Aspirant with a crimson robe, as the Celebrant says: Receive and be invested with, the Crimson robe in token of your ardour, zeal and promised devotion to the Rosicrucian Order. Let the Aspirant be placed in the Mystic Circle and join with us in repeating the Initials of the Mystic Word. I.N.R.I. The Mystic Circle is formed, the Aspirant uniting. Celebrant: Brethren and Fraters, I declare this Mystic Circle perfect and the Chain of Union complete. The Brethren clap their arms sharply across the breast. The Aspirant is led to the centre of the Circle and kneels, while the Celebrant, Suifragan and 4 Ancients lay their hands on the head of the Aspirant; when the Chief Adept says: We receive thee, Brother, as a Zelator, and one of the \"eight.\" You may now retire without the Porch of Reflection, and when you shall desire to re−enter you will place your name on one side of a triangular piece of white paper, and the Mystic Initials on the Altar, and exhibit the same to the Acolyte at the entrance. The Aspirant is escorted to the entrance, the escort excepting the Conductor of Novices returning to their stations. The Conductor, in Preparation chamber, instructs the Aspirant that his preparing the paper signifies his sufficient reflection, and his determined desire for more light.

You will now repair to the Suffragan in the West, and give due heed to the historical narrative of our Order. Then return again to me for final instruction. The Aspirant is conducted to the Suffragan and seated. Suffragan: While instructing you in our modem system of Ethics and general metaphysics, we adhere to the old Fables and Legends pertaining to the Rosicrucian Society, and accordingly introduce you to so much of the habits, customs and manners of living of those Philosophers and the general arrangement of their Home, as is essential at the present time for your just appreciation of our theme. Listen! Historical Narrative Buried in the depths of solitude, far from the sight and sound of human life, partly rock−hewn and partly constructed of massive stone closely and carefully placed in position, were three clustering and connecting, but equally sized compartments; so completely and studiously compacted and deadened in their structure and approach that the outside world could not know of their existence were the roar of thunder, or the shouts of Myriads to awake their echoes in these subterranean halls. One chamber was devoted to a general Laboratory with a section set apart for domestic purposes, with ingenious sieve−like flues for the unrecognisable escape to the outer world of the smoke, gasses and fumes. This Apartment was long and of ample size; while the Second, also rectangular in shape, was set apart for rest, containing rude couches and also simple tables for simpler fare. Opposed to this, across the Main Laboratory and opening into it, but with descending steps, was the Third and largest Hall, with rising pointed roof of rugged structure, used for a monkish study and Chapel, as well. At regular intervals through the centre, were four cubic tables used as desks with seats of stone, and pendant from the centre of the lofty roof hung the wondrous lamp, whose radiant flame, was as the rosy light of a summer’s setting sun, intensely golden, illuminating all space, never needing care and inexhaustible. High above all else in the groins of the roof, was a white and black, yet massive Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in Anglia Second Section 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Roman Cross, deftly carved in marble. Into these sacred, silent precincts none were allowed to enter except the Adepts, the Magister Templi and the Magus, save at the daily morning and evening hour of prayer, when all must gather for silent worship, or at periods of Reception of Aspirants, or during the Annual Assembly. These solitary chambers formed the home of 36 of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood, no more, no less, could occupy these rock−built Halls: all others were constrained to serve their learnings and to account for deeds of good and service done. Their brief sojourn being ended, from the entire number the Magus again tailed off those who were to serve humanity at large and 36 remained. With pestle, mortar, alembic, crucible and forge; with nitre, resin, roselite and various sulphate strangely compounded, and with astronomic instruments and tablets so passed the years in these wondrous Caverns; all intent upon the abstruse study of analyses and syntheses to the end of conquering the possible; the reduction or destruction of pain and waste in physical organism, the rejuvenation of man, the obtainment of the general solvent, or Menstrum Universale, which should possess the power of removing all the seeds of disease from the human system, thereby renewing life, the transmutation of baser to superior metals, or the elevation of the Divine in Man. Twice had the iron−tongued bell echoed through the rocks, startling the monks from their reveries and duties, proclaiming some potent special secret found. Once it was the Mystery solved, that alloy and baser metal had yielded to transmutation to Silver, and again, once to the richer Gold, but their products were not permitted to result in ease and luxury. The greatest secret yet lay hid, the prolongation, the rejuvenation of animal life. ‘Twas death to strike the tocsin−bell, save by him whose skill had solved one of four problems: First, the rejuvenation of the ever−burning lamp; Second, the transmutation to Silver; Third, the transmutation to gold; and Fourth, the discovery of the Elixir Vitae. Of this last, long had the Frater, Signor Gualdi, a Magister Templi, daily hoped for the final solution; that he was on the verge of the discovery he had no doubt, and his belief was imbued in the minds of his fellows, he longed to sound the bell and startle his own soul. In letters of fire he had written this aphorism, Igne Nitrum Roris Invenitur, \"by Fire the Nitre of the dew is extracted\" and this was to be his solution. All nature slept, the wearied monks save, save one, had gone to rest, the very fires of the forge were wrapped in slumber, when at the dread hour, the hopeful Gualdi, rose from his seat of stone in the brilliant but rocky chapel, and shouting Eureka, rang out the bell with unearthly clangour, startling the very rocks into echo. It as suddenly ceased as Monk followed Monk into the Holy Chamber to meet, to see nought, even to hear but the still resounding echo of the clamouring bell. At the central table−altar were open books of Gualdi; by their side a small vessel containing nitre and a crucible partly filled with gold held in solution. A further search disclosed the overcome Gualdi prone on the pavement, still holding the thong of the bell. Repair now to the Celebrant. The Aspirant is conducted to the Celebrant by the North. Celebrant: Here, for the present, we must rest, but we cannot leave the subject without offering to remove from your mind unpleasant impressions, if any exist, as to who the former Rosicrucians were.

The want of intelligence would be simply amazing were it not evident that the mischievous ignorance of a few has been repeated successively without individual research. Ignorance, prejudice, envy and conceit have taken possession of the minds of the critics and Historians; yet the unique and attractive Rosaic doctrines interested vast masses of 17th century, although the society had taken its rise in the latter part of the 15th century. The lives of the Rosicrucians were dramatic to a sensational degree. The practical branch of the Society was in charge of Alchemists and Hermeticists, who while they claimed, and not without much reason, their ability to transmute metals to Silver or Gold, further sought for mental and moral powers, rather than riches, which are the aims of true philosophers. The real philosopher looks not for pomp, glitter, splendour nor luxury, he has been schooled in a higher sphere and he appreciates their transitory nature. Wealth in money to him is dross, far desire, and freedom from confused annoyance of worldly thoughts, which are engendered and distracted by the purchases of riches. Possessions, honour, rank and money to him are but as trifles; he forces the growing Supernatural soul to work amidst the loving sunshine and to propagate holy thoughts as the most precious of heavenly gifts. Worldly grandeur fades before intellectual elevation; the physical world sinks below him and he feels nearer to the angelic Hosts. He values the unseen kingdoms, and glimpses of immortal glories obtained from Magic reveries. He dwells in an atmosphere of heavenly music, his soul keeping harmony with the yearnings of his intellect. The earnest wish of the Rosicrucians was to pass through with World unnoticed and unchallenged, but ever prepared for exalted action when in their power, without a revelation of who they are. Now, Frater Zelator, having passed through the ceremonies required by our Ordinance, and having knelt before the Altar of Light, you are permitted to join in the Mystic labours of this grade. This privilege is conferred only upon discreet and worthy men to whom the revelations of Theosophy and Hermetic Science may be safely confided. In our ceremony you may have noticed a similarity to certain Rite practised in the Ancient Mysteries. It is thus that we hope to lead the sincere Aspirant to the lofty realms of intellectual Truth and to the knowledge of the Everlasting. We trace the growth of our philosophy through the remotest avenues of time, sustained by the continuous advent of Sages and Magi, a grand and spiritual procession of teachers illuminating the pathway to Wisdom, The great and wise men of were the heralds of our principles and kindled their lamps at the Sacred Fire in which we now rejoice. Falter not because the way seems long and the Soul is weary, but toil on toward the higher planes of Wisdom. Life itself is imaged in this opening ceremony, and the serpent course, truly and divinely directed, is that of the Wise Men in search of Truth.

Water forms the largest portion of the blood, without it there could be no corruption, fermentation or dissolution.

Fire preserves the Earth from being overwhelmed or destroyed by Water; the Air preserves the Fire that it is not extinguished; and Water preserves the Earth from being burned. Yet if either of these active elements was to become predominant in any great degree, the greater World would be destroyed, and with it the Microcosm, or little World.

Much of the learning of those who have gone before has been lost to us; we seek to regain past knowledge.

The Rosicrucian Chemist bestows his time, dutifully to God in diligent search of the Scriptures, in healing without man's reward, and in experimenting in the hidden secrets of Nature and Art; he delves in true physics and medicine, and as the hope you will hereafter discover in true mathematics and Astronomy, by which being enabled to produce more and wonderful effects, he is brought nearer to God and his perfections; but perfection is obtainable only in the Spirit when beyond these realms. As Rosicrucians we are laborious, frugal, temperate, discreet and true, and. while acknowledging ourselves lovers of Truth and Virtue we neither dream of, hope for, nor endeavour to make any reformation in the World through abstract religious dogmas.

Conductor of N.: The three strokes of the bell you heard but now, gave notice for silent meditation preparatory for Evening Prayer: these Chemists have retired to the Chapel. Frater Theoricus, you doubtless question the nature of this apartment and why this scene. You were informed in the Grade of Zelator, of three rock−built Halls in juxtaposition, they were the Main Laboratory, the Apartment for refreshment and rest, and the Secret or Sacred Hall, sometimes termed the Chapel, seclusive under certain circumstances: You were also told of the discovery of the transmutation to Silver and Gold, of the continued search for the re−invention of the wondrous ever−burning Lamp and the presumed discovery of the \"Elixir of Life\" by Frater Gualdi, of whom you will learn more hereafter, end his being found apparently lifeless as he rung the great Death−bell. Let me give you a further insight into this Home of the Rosicrucians. In connection with the general structure of the three Apartments were four other and smaller rooms opposite the Laboratory, and on the other side of the Chapel or Congregating Hall. These were variously fitted up and adapted to the purposes of which they were assigned as will be made known to you. They were of about equal size and could aggregate a space covering the Main Hall to which each one communicated by a short passage while having inter−communication with each other. Upon entering the first passage from the Chapel Porch, and near what we may term the South−West, we are led to the entrance of a quadrangular apartment of convenient proportions; having a rude built roof with sieve flue or outlet for vapours, and fitted up and devoted to Chemistry, Alchemy and their kindred studies. The equipment of materials essential for service were plain receptacles, but apparently for a long series of years been in practical use. In this apartment evidently unconscious of any intrusion were gowned and cowled in blue, seven Students of the Pestle and Mortar, mixing, compounding and calculating without unnecessary converse or recognition of each other's presence, but deeply intent upon their assumed tasks. These were the Theorici or Rosicrucians of the 2nd Grade. Acids and Chemicals, roots, herbs, gums and minerals in abundance, in powders and pastes, and all apparently in confusion, surrounded the wells, on shelves, in closets, and drawers, in bottles, jars and boxes, stored to all appearance in unknown quantities. These were Nature's unadulterated gifts to be used for the health and preservation of Man. The small Laboratory was made famous in the early part of the 16th Century by the following discovery of transmutation by the Chemists of the Rosicrucians: while examining and investigating the amalgam of Mercury, Lead and Arquifoux with the readily fusible Bismuth, wonderful changes appeared by the introduction of a solution known to the Theorici as 'Primitia' or Primordial Solution. Slowly did these changes appear, when a whitish metal, in grains and dendrites, of the colour of silver with a similar lustre and ductility, yet softer, was found mixed with cobalt bloom, a little Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in Anglia Second Section Colour Blue 23"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"sulphuret and chloride of silver. The interest manifested in this hitherto unknown production or result among the Theorici attracted the attention of the Alchemists of the Grade of Practicus, who pronounced the discovery of the transmutation of Silver. Then the deep−toned bell was for the first time rung with no uncertain sound, and the Brethren assembled in the Chapel for praise and prayer. A feeling of cupidity immediately seized the Brethren of the Society, and with caution of no less than 10,000 Marks of this silver were disposed of in the various cities of Europe, when the Magus and his Council forbade, under pains and penalties the further production of the metal in consequence of its evident baneful effect upon the entire Rosicrucian Society, and the danger of their organisation being annihilated. This famed discovery took place in the apartment intended to be represented by the one in which you are: and to this extent you are now introduced into the Home and to the Study of the Second Grade of the Rosicrucians. There being a vacancy in the number allowed to the Theorici; you form one of the Select Seven. The Chemists are about to return, let us retire.

Suffragan: Theoricus, you have now arrived at the third grade, or Physical branch of the System of Rosicrucianism called Practicus. You are now to delve in the Mines of Alchemy and Hermeticism so far as we may be enabled, under our brief forms and symbolic services to impart the same to you. We can, at best, but place in your hands the wrap upon which you must weave the threads, which we will also give you (some dark and sombre, other bright and golden) a picture pleasing to the eye of the Eternal, who is to pass upon your work. Alchemy is so called because it is an instrument by which the good is to be separated from the evil; and what is not mature it matureth. It is a primary power, pure and uncorrupted, it exerciseth with the intellectual man and takes no part with the unthinking and indolent. Draw then upon your innate and tutored mind, and. follow us in our course of reasoning. Alchemists claim the power after eliminating and dispersing the u1timate and grosser elements of bodies by the influence of Fire, to grasp and hold the residing spirit from escape to the ethereal world beyond this World, and require and demand of it obedience and submission to their will. Hermeticism overrides and transcends nature, and by its art directed upon Nature, accomplishes rapidly that which nature requires an almost infinite period to effect. In these matters therefore be attentive and diligent, and we will accordingly regard you by a higher rank in the scale of Rosicrucianism. We purposely propose making to you a new and startling discovery, and assigning you work in a more interior apartment of our moral laboratory. You are to be instructed in the use of new and subtle simples and compounds of more artful and ingenious composition, through the force of elimination by Fire or Flame, Be not regardless of their symbolic application. Lest our approach to Alchemic discovery may be thoughtlessly revealed, we find it essential. to employ symbols to obscure our thoughts and ideas to the worldly and curious. But through our symbols you will be enabled to resolve immaterial thoughts into form, and adjust God's mental gifts and promised insight of the inner−life into a more finished moral, spiritual and individual system. With this preliminary instruction repair to the Celebrant and be obedient to his requirements. The Conductor accompanies the Theoricus to the Celebrant in the centre of the Hall, who is seated facing the West, with an Altar of Incense in front of him, lighted.

Think of the shapes assumed by Fire, as the Flames noiselessly creep, entwine, spreading and widening, now contracting and deepening: Mark its changefulness of colour, as in its increasing ardour it reddens, glows, then whitens. Mark the phantasms springing from the forge, as the ponderous sledge strikes the anvil, or the burning wheel flashes out its subtle sparks, singly, in pairs, by scores, then by Myriads hastening into space, like the flashing guns of contending infantry, or the clashing sabres of the fierce squadrons of horse; until in brief, armies of hungry demons in their wild career are seen it. their brilliancy, and then by an invisible agency are extinguished. Behold aloft the glowing sky with myriad stars, a brilliant sea of reflecting Flame.

The appearance of Deity when making himself manifest to men has invariably been in a glory, a halo, or surrounded by Flame, brightness and Fire, whether on an occasion of beneficence or displeasure: wonder not then that the Eastern nations were lead to look on God as embodied in Fire, and finally as the vivid symbol of the Divine presence. When in solemn convocation, they swore not by the Altar, but by the Flame or Fire which was upon the Altar, the emblem of the Deified Fire, disguised in many theological or theosophic forms. Lead on.

Thus, the souls of men are, according to the oldest Egyptian school of ethics, formed of Ether, at death return to it again. The Celestial Fire is here represented by the vestal lamp having a tapering flame, indicative of God s influence and continued activity. It is the Everlasting Light, that like the incense conveys the unknown and unseen, even unto the direct presence of the All; the praise and supplication of mortal man.

The 4th Ancient has three tapers burning in front of him placed in position of a triangle and a small cross in the centre thereof, representing the Divine Lux. 4th Ancient: To me is awarded the impressive duty of explaining the Divine Essence of Fire: The Holy and Perpetual Fire which was under the constant care of the Virgin Priestesses, whose services of purity were preserved in the doctrines taught in Persia, Egypt, Greece and Italy, and were termed 'perpetual watches' or 'watch lights', this observance is still maintained in the Persian, Roman and Hebrew faiths. It is their 'Ignis Aeternus', The Holy ceremony of Fire pervades all religious systems, being a universal symbol in worship, a visible representation of the spirit of the Invisible. For as Fire is everywhere, so God is everywhere, about us and in us, and thus we are God−lighted men. This was the teaching of the Fire−worshippers, who claimed the discovery of the Eternal Fire, or thus to have approached their Master in the 'Immortal Light'. The comprehension of all this, and the re−embodiment of this truth in their philosophy was the claim of the Rosicrucians. As Fire dissolveth all things, dissipateth all things, and causeth them to become invisible, true philosophy could go no further, and so adoration was paid to the unknown God in the last image that was possible to men of anything; Fire, which was known as his shadow. In all this we contemplate not the Natural Fire, but the Symbolic, the Celestial, the Divine, the Ineffable ethereal spirit; the immortal fervour, into which the world evolves. Lead on.

He is the alleged inventor of Alchemy: the father of that species of philosophy, which claims to solve and explain all the phenomena of nature from the three chemical principles, salt, sulphur and mercury: A system which reveals the causes of diseases, and the operations of medicines, on the principle of an Alkali and Acid. In this and congenial studies by being an active participant you are entitled to rank as Practicus. 2nd Alchemist: In continuation of your late instruction received from the four Ancients, let me speak of our practical experience in this Laboratory. Your attention was drawn to the various phases of Fire. We exemplify, that Fire disjoints and unhinges all classes of matter, dark metals run like waters of light, the demons are conjured out of the Minerals, and they are shown as angels white. By Fire we lay our hands upon the solids, part them, powder them, melt them, fine them, drive them out to delicate and Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in Anglia Practicus 30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"impalpable texture; firing them into cloud, mist, gas, into nothing. Men of Science cannot tell. us what is Fire, but simply say, it is a phenomenon; they cannot tell whence it comes, or whither it goeth. They tell us it is the evolution of Light and hear in the combustion of bodies. Conductor: What knowledge can you impart upon the effect of the Fire element upon the production of precious metals? 3rd Alchemist: We may advise you, that Gold and Silver are the chief metals of the Alchemists, and the two chief Mystic Symbols of the Rosicrucians. Fire, light, vitality exists in everything, metal, stone and timber, when the 'Life' of which is gone, it becomes unfit for service. In the combination of the metals which was explained to you as a Theoricus, you well remember of the product of silver through the germ of Primordium, which germ has also given to us the product of Gold, and which it is ardently hoped will shortly give to us the Elixir Vitae. To the uninstructed, it is the generally received opinion that these things are among the impossible: this may be, but the approach, to us, seems at our door, and not a drew, nor a fable. This possibility is based upon the assumption that every metal consists of Mercury as a versatile and flexible base, out of which all metals have their being, and. into which they may be ultimately reduced by Art. 2nd: That the Species of Metals and their specific forms are not subject to transmutation, but only the individual or primal parts, which are visible and can be acted upon. 3rd: All metals differ in their degree of perfection or purity toward the invisible Light or Life which is within everything, the 'Celestial glory', or primordial base, which has matter for its cover, or exterior, or mask. 4th: Art overleaps and transcends Nature, accomplishing, quickly that which Nature requires periods to attain. 5th: God has created every metal of its own kind, and fixed in them a principle of growth, especially in Gold, the Superior metal, and which in itself has magnetic seed, an unseen power, unappreciable in this world, but which Art can , inspire and multiply. We feel that we are upon the eve of obtaining this power, for what may be done with metal, may have a co−relative effect upon the human body; that is that the solution of prolongation of animal life must follow quickly upon the ability to transmute other metals to Gold, as they are kindred, the purest metallic life with animal life. The ability to hold Gold in solution is already familiar to us. Conductor: What mean you by the product of Gold by Nature through germination and increase; is it subject to multiplication through seed as in the animal and vegetable kingdoms? 4th Alchemist: Certainly, but under a modified process of Nature. The precious metals are nurtured, and subject to increase through the secret operations of the Planets, they gestate and grow daily in the bowels of the earth. The Sun and Moon, night and day, light and darkness, water and fire are all active in the generation of the precious metals. It has been a matter of assumption, that the invisible operation of the Sun effects the natural production of Gold, while the refining and bleaching lucidity of the Moon had its effect on Silver. Whence their origin, if they do not germinate and fructify in the Laboratories of the Earth as in the womb of their Mother, and produce strains of Nature in maturing? The purpose of the Alchemist is to assist Nature and expedite it through the hermetic Art.

Conductor: The production of the precious metals is only through assisting Nature in its more rapid gestation, while the multiplying its seed is an impossibility? 4th Alchemist: Not altogether so, for the Rosicrucian Alchemist claims to be able to gather the subtle, escaping gases or fumes, he or retain them and reduce them to material shape, thus, metaphorically, they enter the outer world or exterior of visible and material matter, and bring back into visible, tangible form old things metamorphosed into new things. This is the true significancy of Transmutation. The invisible escaping light or fire of certain metals seized upon, that is this 'Fairy Gold', is condensed into real Gold, through the influence of 'Primitia' or Primordial solution. We thus figuratively express our ability 'to go beyond the line of this physical world, to pass as it were into the next world, work in it, and come back in safety bearing our well earned trophies of marketable gold, and the Elixir Vitae, or the means of rejuvenation, and perpetuation of human life. We thus become possessed of a revealed divine power, having the impress of immortality, and termed the monstruum or Hagisterium, which seizes upon the departing breath of the spirit, as it wings from man, and wins it back despite itself to redischarge its functions. The physical man is estopped in his decay, in his daily bodily corruption and the escaping native Fire resumes its ordinary duty end faculty. This paradox presents itself, 'Light is material and hence must be dark, as all material, hence it cannot be light to us, though it may be darkness to God'. Conductor: That evidence can be produced of these powers of change in material substances and immaterial shadows? 5th Alchemist: Have you not already witnessed them, or does not your intellect present them possible? May there not be faculties in Man beyond those of perception through hearing, tasting, smelling, feeling and seeing? It is not necessary for the eyeless cave−fish have orbs end fitting sockets, to give it perceptive sight. Give me your Scarlet Rose, the emblem of our Love, the symbol of our darning Faith in eternal Life. 5th Alchemist takes the Rose from the Cross, and holds it in the fumes of flour of sulphur, which flour is taken from a jar, and sprinkled on the chemical flaming tripod dish: The Chemist then continues: Behold this beauteous Rose of scarlet colour and brilliant hue, emblematic of the blood that washes away the sins of the world, note its contact with the fumes of this simple yellow mineral and the effect; how gradually end yet certainly it conceals its collar, when the sulphurous gases, as of an evil Spirit, dare to approach it.

Our expressive emblem of Man’s redemption, blushing in its pride, fails not to hide its beauty and scorning the distasteful union, exhibits its defilement through every part; as the Soul grows pallid by contagion with the influences of the evil One, whose symbols are sulphur in contact with Fire. So here Sulphur and Fire work their fearful sickly curse. But be ye ever so impure, the crystal Waters of Life by repentance and faith will wash your sins away, and make you pure as ere thou were before pollution. In like manner I baptise this symbol, and behold it shall be as God created it in all its beauty and radiant splendour. As this last sentence is uttered, the 5th Alchemist will rinse the Rose in a prepared chalice of pure water when the rose will resume its original colour. Hast thou sinned, repent and wash thou in the Waters of Life and God will make you pure. A distant gong strikes 12 equal notes, tolling: which one of the Alchemists counts as it strikes. 1st Alchemist: One half the hours of Hermes are gone, and Gualdi sleeps, but one stroke more and all our hopes are ended. The Gong sounds one stroke more. The Council have decided: our Gualdi's dead. The secret I form is forever buried. All the Alchemists rise, make the sign of the Cross with arms extended, then clasp them on their breasts, and are sealed in silence and bowing. Shortly the 1st Alchemist , recovering, speaks : Know, Frater, The cause of our sudden grief. Our hopes, our convictions, were centred, and our belief is still unshaken, that the Great Mysterium is discovered, but the secret was with the Magister Templi, Gualdi; who at the instant of his discovery, rang of the welcome tidings, but becoming overjoyed at his success, the functions of Nature succumbed, and he was found at the midnight hour by those he had alarmed still holding the thong that sounded the joyous news, but as it now appears, his own death knell. It was his habit to pursue his labours at night when all nature was still and his Fraters in repose: his success was foreshadowed and a nightly alarm expected; but from the time of the finding his body he has never uttered a word, or given his watchers a sign. The solution that was found on his central desk contained Nitre and Gold in solution with some other admixture: and his motto, 'Igne Nitrum Roris Invenitur', by Fire the Nitre of Dew is extracted, scrawled in crimson upon a piece of dyed skin, was laying close by his seat. The supposition was entertained that he may have drunk of the solution, and his own life might thereby be saved: his body was taken accordingly to the Chamber of Rest, together with his books, and the chemica1s with which he was experimenting, in hopes of his giving evidence of life and revealing the long sought for secret. It had been agreed that his watchers should be without intermission, and that the Magus and Council should set this day and hour (it being now 3 days since his syncope commenced) and adjudge him alive or dead: with the notification to the Brotherhood, that one−half the number of hours into which Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in Anglia Practicus 33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Hermes had divided the day should be tolled announcing the conclusion of their decision, and that briefly following one bell stroke should signify their decision of Death, and three in quick succession the power of his resuscitation. The Council has decided, and our worst fears are realised, for we now may never know the composition of the solution which was found at his desk, if indeed that which was left was of itself complete as a compound. This hopeful yet startling fact remains to console us, his body does not corrupt, though the heart is still, and the sensory nervous life is inactive, circulation and nutrition have ceased and the 'Fiat' of the Council is pronounced. Now, Frater, should this body not corrupt, your original question of how to conquer disease, which is life's enemy, would appear to be solved. Your second interrogatory is to be sought for in and after study, and with the Adepts. We will now retire to the Chapel or Sacred Hall, and leave you under the care of your able and wise Conductor. The Alchemists retire, with arms crossed on breast. Conductor: Frater, the learned Alchemist who has just left us, is a wise and noted Rosicrucian; he intimates to you the source from which the name of this noble Fraternity takes its rise, at least this scientific portion: thus, the name comes from 'Ros', the Latin word for Dew, and 'Crux', 'Cross'. From the mystical Cross is formed the letters spelling the Latin word Lux, or Light or Fire: hence the hidden significancy in the Aphorism, 'By Fire the Nitre of the Dew is extracted', or 'Igne, Nitrum, Roris, Invenitur'. The great revival in this class or branch of Rosicrucianism was at Paris. In March 1623, when the number 36 was thus distributed, 6 in Paris, 6 in Italy, 6 in Spain, 12 in Germany, 4 in Sweden and 2 in Switzerland. You well remember what was said to you of the discovery of transmutation to Silver, and the excitement occasioned thereby, as narrated to you in the preceding Grade of Theoricus, but the wildness of enthusiasm was evinced, when the Practicus Philosophers sounded that terrible Bell, which announced the double discovery of the Transmutation to 'White Gold', or Platinum. and that of Virgin Gold. The sole attention of the 6 Alchemists of the Practicus Grade was given to the transformation of metals to Gold, immediately after realising the force of Primitia when excercised by Fire upon certain. primary metals and producing silver. Realising that through evolution all things in the Universe had succumbed to change, and that by progression even in the metals a theory of successive changes is established by which nature reveals strange results, the task remained to ascertain the requisite metals for the combination, with the proper proportions thereof, and the dynamic conditions or laws by the use of Primitia to produce the desired result, which was Gold. They were confident that Mercury was an essential: that copper was necessary, and most likely sulphur and tin. The ability to hold Gold in solution had already been conquered by Nitro Nuriatic Acid. In forming Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in Anglia Practicus 34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the amalgam native gold was added to the above named metals, as a seed. The course of Nature, under the operation of a simple and universal law, is effected, sometimes slowly, before evolution ensues exhibiting organic development. Thus having the matter as a vehicle of change, motion being required to attain the result by change, a force became requisite to cause change that evolution should follow. As one thing is derived from others, the problem of advance becomes one of transmutation; and as matter and force are not created, the changes must be those of transformation. The Alchemists then had recourse to Primitia, a Nitre extracted from dew, which caused motion, the mechanical collision, the breathing as it were of the component parts, which produces life, and resulted in a chemical change. This was from an incoherent mass to coherence producing integration of parts. After tedious experimenting, and with different components, two new combinations of great value were disclosed, one of 'White Gold', or Platinum, and the other, the long sought for, malleable, unoxidizing, lustrous, precious gold. Joy and relief to millions of their fellow−men was their first impulse. But had these Alchemists once revealed the power of goldmaking, the metal could have lost its value and not unlikely the producer would have lost his life to gratify an insatiate people. But no, the very knowledge of their magic power, and the surprise at its existence, delighted them more, than aught the World could give. They concealed their Mystery, denied its existence, shunned Society and the World, remained unknown, invisible, illuminated; serving their God and as well mankind, assisting the feeble, frail and suffering. They were overcome and astonished at the immensity of the power accorded by God’s grace to man. A long list of eminent men, experts and profound students have examined the product of gold by Art, and have verified its production in its material state by Alchemical Transmutation. This Chamber, Frater, although small in size, is intended to represent the Laboratory of these Philosophers, as you perceive, and is the Second in the Series of four rooms on the south side of the Sacred Hall, that occupied by the Theorici being the first, and which leads into this by a connecting passage−way. Here you beheld loss of confusion in the retorts, bulbs, receivers, worms and cylinders for compounding and distilled. Here were required scales and measures, heating and hanging lamps, and all the appliances necessary and requisite for the use of the Philosophers of Hermes. Salt, Sulphur and Mercury abound in various shapes. Alkali and Acids continually met the gaze: and in long rows, systematically arranged and occupying one side of the room, were many books of the Egyptians, treating of universal principles, of the nature and orders of Celestial beings. of medicines and ever of divination. The Philosophers were termed 'Practicus', and here they pursued their Hermetic studies. As in the preceding degree of Theoricus, when you were therein admitted to complete the number Seven, so in this Grade of Practicus, you now have been admitted to fill a vacancy and complete their number Six.

For a full knowledge of all these matters, man must await further revelation of Science.

I call your attention to a brief History of Astrology. Know there is no Science so intimately associated with Rosicrucianism, .as the great one of Astronomy, whose study is so interesting, and furnishes such strong proof and evidence at the wondrous power of the Great Creator of all things. It could be impossible to contemplate the Heavens and not believe in the existence of One Supreme Being of the Universe. A consideration of this Science includes the movements, distribution, and the physical characteristics of the Heavenly Bodies. Next to that of tilling the soil to obtain sustenance for life, Astronomy is the oldest Science, for it became essential to measure time, and this could be furnished only through a study of the firmament. The first recorded observations off any remarkable accuracy are those from the Tower of Bel, at Babylon, by the Assyrians in the 23rd century before this era. This powerful Empire understood the use of the Dial, the precession of the Equinoxes, and within a fraction the exact length of the tropical year, they even predicted in some cases, the return of Comets. Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in Anglia Philosophus 43"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The chief seat of Astronomical learning among the Hindus, was at Benares, but the knowledge of the Indians in this Science was not equal to their neighbours. The Egyptians, however, who erected their Pyramids with mathematical precision, and not unlikely for astronomical purposes, and who erected numerous monoliths to their Sun−God Ra, justly receive credit in astronomical history. The remarkable coincidence exists, that through the inclined entrance of the Great pyramid, the Star Draco, in Hesperides, at its upper transit was visible day and night, and marked the period 2170 BC or the period when the chronological mensuration takes 25,868 years to return to itself again. The erection of that Pyramid marked the great year of the Pleiades. The Astronomy of the Chinese is ancient though inexact. The wise Chwien−hio marked 2449 years before Christ, as an Epoch, through the conjunction of Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. These ancient people understood, to some extent, the Celestial motions, calculated Eclipses and slew two of their philosophers, Ho and Hi, for not announcing an eclipse of the Sun, 2169 BC The Ionian School of the Greeks was founded by Thales, of Miletus, 600 BC It thoroughly comprehended the seasonal changes and length of the year. To Hipparchus of Nicaea, however, 160 BC from whom the Ptolemaic School took its rise, is astronomy indebted for evidence of skill and acumen. He catalogued 1082 stars, calculated the motions of the Sun and Moon, made observations of the planets, and described. their motions by a theory of epicycles: he also invented plain and spherical trigonometry. Ptolemy followed, correcting the procession, but insisted in placing the Earth in the centre of his system. The Arabians, impelled by the Mahomedan faith, swept down upon the Egyptians in the 7th. Century, and by the destruction of the Alexandrian Library, the great history of the astronomy of this past was mainly lost to the world. But the Arabians surpassed the Greeks in practical astronomy. Continental Europe took little interest in this Science until the 13th Century, and even then made immaterial advancement until the Active days of the Rosicrucians when Fraters Purbach and Reglementanus paved the way for our Brother Copernicus, who died in 1543, aged 70, and who founded the time System by placing the Sun in the centre, and thus overthrew the Ptolemaic system which had obtained. for 14 Centuries: nevertheless it required Galileo, Keplar, Newton and others to perfect the Copernican system, which was still entangled with the epicycles of Hipparchus and which were removed together with the centricities and concentricities by Keplar, through the theory of the Biblical astronomer Tycho Brahe, a Dane, who pointed out the apparent fixity of the stars, or their enormous uncalculated. distances from the Earth and Sun. The invention of the Telescope now gave birth to new and certain Astronomic knowledge. The discovery of the Satellites of Jupiter by Galileo presented a. miniature of our planetary system and confirmed it. Then Newton announces the discovery of gravitation about 1660, and Picard gives the dimensions of the Earth: Keplar establishes his three famous laws; the procession of the equinoxes is accounted for by the law of gravitation; the theories of tides are established, and the solution of the Earth's oblateness: the inequality of the Moon’s motion by the Sun's attraction, is set at rest; the great laws of the stability of the Planetary System are firmly determined by the law of universal gravitation. The rings of Saturn and her 8 attending Satellites are announced, followed by Herschel’s discovery of Uranus in 1781, and then her four moons; this again by the tidings of the new planet Neptune and his Satellite, and in quick succession no less than 130 Asteroids between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, then. the startling discovery that the rings of Saturn were composed of myriads of small satellites, and finally, that millions of meteoric systems exist within the Sun’s domain more or less associated with the glowing Comets.

The Conductor and Practicus now pass the centre of the East to the Station of the Suffragan. Suffragan: Whatever throws additional light on the marvels of the aerial world, and into the starry depths, necessarily exercises a powerful influence over the mind of the earnest Rosicrucian. Astronomy is an exact Science, but an abstruse subject, yet a simple key opens much of its inner mysteries. We divide the Heavens into three classes, the World of Air, the World of Stars, and the Heaven of Heavens. The first embraces the Atmospheric envelope, clouds, and attendant storms with their inhabitants. The Second includes the infinite space containing the Stars, Planets, Asteroids, Meteors, Comets, Star−Showers, Nebulae and the Universal system while the Third opens to our view God's Holy of Holies, the Eternal Heavens, the Astronomical and Divine evidence of a real or an ideal residence of the Deity. To the Ancients, there were known but seven Planets, the Sun, .Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn, revolving about the central Earth, Each symbolised to them distinctive metals, Gold, Silver, Mercury, Steel, Copper, Tin, and Lead: each had. its assigned colour, musical tone, animal representative, Sacerdotal title, Alphabetical and Mythological designation, as well as Sign, and emanations from the great Central Aeon. The four elements, Earth, Air, Fire and Water, embraced the three principles Body, Soul, and Spirit; these exerted seven influences over the animal creation: there were seven Virtues with corresponding Vices. Seven was the sacred number in all theoginies and all symbols. It represents the magical power in its full force through its composition of three and four, the Triangle and the Cube. It is the Spirit assisted by all the elementary powers, the Soul served by Nature. It is symbolised by a Warrior crowned, bearing a triangle on his cuirass, and standing on a Cube, to which are harnessed. two Sphinxes, one White and the other Black, making contrary exertions, and turning the head to look backward. You will now return to the Chief Adept and be mindful of his final instructions. Conductor of Novices and his Companion repair to the Chief Adept in the centre of the Hall. Chief Adept: My Brother, thus far your instruction has teen mainly directed to Historical and Physical Astronomy, but Man has within him a Microcosmical Sun, Moon and Stars, that bear a. sympathy with the Celestial Bodies, and in the centre of which shines thee Divine Spirit. This Celestial Spirit actuates and influences thee elementary essence and stirs it up to the propagation of its like, for which Nature designed it, shining with a pure, ethereal, angelic part called the rational soul, being a Divine Light, or stream flowing immediately from the Great Creator, and uniting Man with his Maker. 'Vast chain of being which from God began, Nature’s ethereal, human., angel, Man.' The understanding and celestial faculties of man are formed from the ethereal world, the sensitive powers of life and action are derived from the Celestial World, and the gross and corruptible part, the flesh and blood consists of the elementary world, being all subordinate the one to the other.

The Council desires that you instruct this Philosophus further. He seeks to know the future destiny of the Soul, his inner self, his undying and mortal part that must account to an impartial judge. 1st Astrologer: My Son, thou seekest for that which an Omniscient Deity has wisely veiled from man, save through reason and that delicate Monitor, the Conscience, planted in him. These tell us of immortality. But be more specific in Thine inquiry. May it not be of things Mortal, as well as immortal that now concerns thee? Dost thou wish to know of thyself or of another, or is it of coming events of fearful import the dreaded traversing Storm, or other fearful evaluating of Nature which unbidden and unwelcome cause unrest as to the fate of some dear but distant friend?

Apart from Theosophy and Divinity, as Rosicrucians we discuss at our leisure moments, that Occult Philosophy, adopted by Plato, from the more ancient Mysteries, and which consisted of three principal parts. First the proceeding from the doctrine of the \"Soul of the World\". Second, that derived from the consideration of numbers, letters and sacred words; and, Third that resulting from a pure and holy life, and these all summed up in one great system of esoteric ethereal Truth. The Soul of the World is a difficult matter to express, if not to comprehend. We say, the Constellations of the Zodiac govern the earthly animals. Every Star has its peculiar Nature, property and function; the seal and character of which it impresses through its rays upon plants, minerals and animal life. The affinities of these planets and stars are of great power, although it hath been taught, that each planet is active but one day in the seven fold, and further that the precious stones are produced through the Chemic operation of the Planets working secretly in the telluric body. We argue that metals and minerals have but one base or foundation: and having this we would have the key that could unlock the Universe. It hath been further taught that by the Hermetic or Magnetic Light, we can augment and purify indifferent stones and, give them greater value: thus, on Sunday, expose yellow gems and. gold, and their weight will increase through the attractive power by affinity of the Sun; and thus by the Alchemic action of the Moon, pearls and stones of white on Monday are improved: On Tuesday let Mars increase the fire of rubies, while on Wednesday, sapphires, turquoises and gems of blue reflect the brilliant mercury. Jupiter in his majesty, and Thor, are supreme on Thursday and give lustre to Amethysts and stones of sanguine tint. On Freddie, Venus favours emeralds; and on Saturday the oldest of gods, Saturn claims the lustrous diamond. The Planets, too, 'tis claimed, have direct power over the physical action of man, as well as over his intellectual energies; his reason, appetites, senses, and powers of generation. These are some of the theories which tend to prove our Atmospheric envelope a delicate sensorium, promptly responding to every wave of physical energy that beats upon it from stellar space. Future observations will prove that the agency of planets in causing Solar disturbances is powerful to influence the great luminary in causing terrestrial cyclones and earthquakes, and that great magnetic and meteorological disturbances over the entire globe are effected. Cond. of N.: We were taught in the Council that Astronomy was an exact Science, then why these uncertainties and trusting to a future? 3rd Philos.: Mark well, the depths of space lead into infinity in the Universe, the invention of the Galilean Telescope has but opened the eyes of the mind and our instruments though numerous, may be imperfect. The Telescope has revealed the aberration of light, the proper motion of the Stars, the determination of the Sun’s distance and the distances of the Stars, and we hope soon to know their velocity, we have the cosmolabe and astrolabe, the Equatorial, the transit instrument, the Mural circle, and a multiplicity of contrivances; and we have great and calculating minds among us, like unto our Frater Copernicus. Our advance is great, yet we lay the foundation only for that glorious temple of astronomic knowledge which shall be God’s revelation of the heavens to man. Of all the glories off the Soul, of all the harmonies attuned to reason, to the utmost capacity of mind to appreciate the ideal infinite, the wondrous works of God, in their immensity as revealed by astronomy, call forth man’s greatest praise and adoration of the Creator of All.

How intimately our Science of Astronomy is connected and harmonises with Alchemy.
