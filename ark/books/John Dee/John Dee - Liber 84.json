II Other Pantacles were obtained in a similar manner. Here (Plate II.) is the principal one, 3 which, carved in wax, was placed upon the top of the table.

He symbolized the Four - Dimensional Universe in two dimensions as a square surrounded by 30 concentric circles (the 30 Æthyrs or Aires) whose radii increase in a geometrical proportion. The sides of the square are the four great watch - towers (Plates IV. - VII.) which are attributed to the elements. There is also a “black cross” (or “central tablet” according to the arrangement shewn — compare the black cross bordering the tablets in Plate I II. with Plate VIII.). 6 Plate III gives the general view. [The reversed letters which form the word PARAOAN are written in Enochian for convenience, as our A and O are not distinguishable reverse from forward.] Plate IV. gives the complete attribution of t he tablet of Air. The 6 th file is called Linea Patris. The 7 th file is called Linea Filii. The 7 th line is called Linea Spiritus Sancti. This great cross divides the Tablet into four lesser (sub - elemental) Tablets, the left - hand top corner being Air of Air , the right - hand top corner Water of Air, the left - hand bottom corner Earth of Air, the remaining corner Fire of Air. Each of these lesser Tablets contains a Calvary Cross of ten squares, which governs it. Plates V., VI., and VII. are similar for the other elements. This is the way in which the names are drawn from the great Tablets. [Examples taken from Water Tablet.] 1 . Linea Spiritus Sancti gives the Three Holy Names of God of 3 , 4 and 5 letters respectively. MPH. ARSL. GAIOL 2 . A whorl around the c entre of the Tablet gives the name of the Great Elemental King, RAAGIOSL [similarly for Air BATAIVAH, for Earth ICZHHCAL, for Fire EDLPRNAA]. 3 . The 3 lines of the central cross of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost give the names of 6 seniors. [Thus the 4 tabl ets hold 24 “elders,” as stated in the Apocalypse.] They are drawn of seven letters, each from the centre to the sides of the tablet.

Great Central Cross. This has 36 squares, for the decantes of the Zodiac. On the left side of the Pyramid, Linea Patris has the Cardina l signs, the sign of the Element itself at the top, in the order of Tetragrammaton (Fire, Water, Air, Earth) going upwards. Linea Filii has the Common signs in the same order. Linea S.S. has the Cherubic signs, that of the element on the left, in the same order, right to left. But the order of the decans in each sign is reverse, and thus the planets which fill the right - hand side of the Pyramids go in the first two cases downwards, and in the third from left to right. The upper sides of the Pyramids are all attributed to the Element of Spirit, the lower sides to the Element of the Tablet. Each square is also referred to the small card of the Tarot which corresponds to the Decan (see 777 12 ). 2 . Calvary Crosses. Each has 10 squares. The upper sides of the Pyra mids are uniformly given to Spirit, the lower sides to the Sephiroth, in the order shewn. 13 The left - hand sides are attributed to the element of the Tablet, the right - hand sides to the sub - element of the lesser angle. 14 3 . Kerubic Squares. The upper sides pertain to the element of the Tablet, the lower sides to the sub - element. Right - and left - hand sides in this case correspond, according to a somewhat complex rule which it is unnecessary to give here. 15 The attributions to the Court Cards of the Tarot nat urally follow. 16 4 . Lesser Squares. The upper side of each pyramid is governed by the Kerub standing on the file above it. The lower side is governed by the Kerub also, but in order descending as the are from right to left above.

Liber Chanokh was first published in two parts as “A Brief Abstract o f the Symbolic Representation of the Universe derived by Doctor John Dee through the scrying of Sir Edward Kelly” in Equinox vol. I nos. 7 - 8 . The second part bore an A ∴ A ∴ Class B imprimatur on first publication. The alternate title and number ( 84 = ]wnj , the Hebrew name anglicised as Enoch) were given in the list of Class B publications in Equinox vol. I no. 10 , where it was also stated “Its publication is at present i ncomplete.” In the Blue Equinox , a continuation of Chanokh was advertised for publication in Equinox vol. III, but along with many things in that list it was never published, and quite possibly never written. The present edition consists of the two publis hed sections. All footnotes are from the Equinox publication; all endnotes by the present transcriber. Of course in some senses Liber Chanokh is redundant as there are far better guides to both “Dee purist” and Golden Dawn Enochian magick out there; the present edition – part of an ongoing project of producing good electronic copies of the magical instructions from the Equinox – was in large measure a reaction to the insanity of attempting to render the complex figures in ASCII or as text descriptions. It is not clear what was intended for inclusion in the unpublished parts; to adequately deal with all the matters mentioned in Crowley’s “prefaratory note” would probably take a few books. At the time Crowley was writing, the Tables of Soyga were mostly los t (eight of the tables had been copied into Sloane MS 3189 ) and known mainly by passing references in the Dee diaries and papers by Elias Ashmole. The “Book of Soyga” was rediscovered by Dee scholar Deborah Harkness in 1994 ; copies exist in the British Li brary (Sloane MS 8 ) and the Bodleian (Bodley 908 ); the former is believed to be the copy owned by Dee. Besides various writings on magick this book contains 36 cryptic tables of letters. These were solved in 1998 by Jim Reeds, a cryptographer working fo r AT&T Labs (see Reeds’ article “John Dee and the Magic Tables in the Book of Soyga ”; unfortunately, since Reeds left AT&T this is no longer online). Note that these tables predate the Dee - Kelly workings, and Dee does not seem to have known what they were and what to do with them: he repeatedly asked about them and received vague or evasive answers from Kelly and/or the angels. The Heptarchic system of planetary magick is covered by Turner ( 1983 ) and James ( 1984 ), and a “Golden - Dawn - ized” version is presen ted by Zalewski ( 1990 ). It is set out in two MS digests by Dee, De Heptarchia Mystica in Sloane 3191 , and Compendium Heptarchia Mystica (Add. MS 36,674 ). This material is drawn from the skrying sessions recorded in Sloane MS 3188 , principally Tertius and Quartus but incorporating material from all the books. It is not clear whether what Dee meant by the “Book of Enoch” was the “Tablets of Enoch” which are definitely identical with the tablets composing the Great Table (Table of Watchtowers), or Liber Loga eth , though the latter seems to be the favoured interpretation. Logaeth survives in BL Sloane MS 3189 , Liber Mysteriorum Sextus et Sanctus , in Edward Kelly’s handwriting. This copy has the title “The Book of Enoch, revealed to Dr. John Dee by the Angels” , interpolated by Elias Ashmole. To the best of my knowledge nobody has deciphered Logaeth to date. Thomas Head (in Regardie (ed.), 1984 ) claimed to have been able to solve some of the tables and tentatively translate some of the material in the “Angelic language” contained in the book; he did not give further details and as far as I am aware has not published his findings. Some researchers (e.g. Laycock, 1978 ) are of the opinion that the material recorded in Logaeth may be a glossolalia."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"LIBER LXXXIV 35 It appears that some unacknowledged work in the compilation of the published parts of Chanokh was done by James Windram, Crowley’s South African lieutenant; and that Crowley later attempted to palm off the work of writing the continuation onto him, but without result. Th e first part of Chanokh was reprinted as The Symbolic Representation of the Universe by Unicorn Press of Seattle in the 1970s. Both published parts were included in the compilation Gems from the Equinox edited by F.I. Regardie, the plates vilely reproduce d and the number of the work erroneously given as LXXXIX, under which number it has occasionally been cited by later writers. I have adapted as a convenience Regardie’s interpolation of “The Symbolic Representation of the Universe” as a sub - title for the first part. It was again reprinted in Enochian World of Aleister Crowley ( Enochian Sex Magick ) by C.S. Hyatt and Lon Milo DuQuette (New Falcon: 1991). The present key entry was made from a facsimile of Equinox I ( 7 - 8 ). The Holy Table, Ensigns of Creation , and Sigillum Dei Æmeth were redrawn based on material in Ben Rowe’s Enochian Magic Reference and Clay Holden’s PDFs of Mysteriorum Liber Secundus and Mysteriorum Liber Tertius . The general view of the Great Table was entered from the version in the Equi nox ; the views of the Watchtowers and Tablet of Union as pyramid squares were redrawn, the letters checked against Plate III and the symbols checked according to the Golden Dawn rules printed in Regardie (ed.), The Golden Dawn . The version of the “Enochia n” alphabet used in Plates IV - IX is the NI EnochianA typeface constructed by the present editor, closely based on the final forms of the letters from Quinti Libri Mysteriorum Appendix , as printed by Laycock ( 1978 ). Plate X has been redrawn and corrects a few minor errors (omission of some numbers and direction markers). As regards the text I have only corrected what seemed to me to be obvious typographical errors; other doubtful readings have been left intact and remarked on in endnotes. I would like to thank Frater o.b. for technical advice, however I take full responsibility for any errors in the above or in the following notes. Love is the law, love under will.

Finally I will warn the reader that Schueler & Schueler’s “Enochian” books for Llewellyn sh ould not be regarded as a reliable source of information on either ‘Dee purist’ or Golden Dawn Enochian magick, or anything else for that matter. Endnotes Part I 1 : These talism ans, the Ensigns of Creation, are referred to the seven planets (clockwise from top) Venus, Sol, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Luna. The details of the ensigns are not visible on the graphic of the Holy Table (Plate I). The seven ensigns and an account of their reception can be found in Mysteriorum Liber Tertius . 2 : The letters on the Holy Table itself are derived from the names of the Heptarchic Kings and Princes. The method is described in Dee’s Libri Mysteriorum Quinti Appendix and in various second ary sources such as Turner’s notes to De Heptarchia Mystica , Ben Rowe’s Enochian Magic Reference and Zalewski ( 1990 ) . Most printed editions reverse the arrangement of the letters left to right from the design described in the Dee diaries, following the ve rsion printed in TFR (most likely the result of an error by the engraver). Since in Chanokh Crowley simply reproduced the plate of the table from Casaubon and did not treat of it in detail, I have seen fit to reconstruct the figure. Note though that in C rowley’s vision of the 15 th Æthyr in The Vision and the Voice the “Holy Twelvefold Table of OIT ” was probably conceived according to the Casaubon printing, i.e. reading O I T R L U L R L O O E so the names OIT , RLU and OOE ( LRL is palindromic) mention ed in that vision would be read left to right on the table as printed in Casaubon and the Equinox , but right to left on the table reconstructed from the angels’ directions (there is evidence in the Dee MSS that “Enochian” should be written right to left). 3 : A full account of the reception of the Sigillum Dei Æmeth is contained in Mysteriorum Liber Secundus . The plate of the seal has been redrawn based on the account in Secundus and on Clay Holden’s reconstruction: the rendition in the Equinox printing, w hich has been much reproduced, contained a number of errors."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"NOTES 38 4 : That is, four others similar in design; they were to be encased in “hollow things, of Sweet Wood” mounted on the end of each table leg. 5 : Most of these names consist of a transliteration of the Hebrew for the “Sphere of the Planet” with “ - el” stuck on the end. See Agrippa De occulta philosophia tom. III cap. XXVIII , where most of these names appear: “,,, the spirit of Saturn is called Sabathiel ; the spirit of Jupiter Zedekiel ; the spirit of Mars, Madimiel ; the spirit of the Sun Semeliel , or Semeschia ; the spirit of Venus Nogahel ; the spirit of Mercury Cochabiah , or Cochabiel ; the spirit of the Moon, Jareahel , or Levanael .” A Corabiel is cited as one of the “Angels of the First Heaven ruling Monday” in the Heptameron of pseudo - Abano, but there has no particular connection to Mercury. Crowley omits to mention the names formed from the letters written along the outer heptagon; the “Seven Angels which stand in the presence of God” mentioned by A grippa ( De occ. phil. , tom. II cap. X ). These should be arranged by rows, thus: Z l l R H i a a Z C a a c b p a u p n h r h d m h i a i k k a a e e e i i e e l l l e e l l M G + then reading down columns we get Z APHKIEL , Z ADKIEL , C UMAEL , R APHAEL , H ANIEL , M ICHAEL , G ABRIEL for the seven classical planets, with the final + signifying the Earth. 6 : While there does indeed appear in TFR (p. 179 ) an arrangement of the letters from the black cross as a five by four table, this appears to have been a conven ience adopted during the communication of the Great Table (Table of Watchtowers); as the letters were immediately afterwards written into the cross between the four tablets, described as the “crosse of union, or black cross” ( ibid ., p. 180 ). The importanc e it assumed in the Golden Dawn appears to derive from an intermediate source, possibly Sloane MS 307 , an edited extract from which became ‘H’, Clavicula Tabularum Enochii . 7 : I have transcribed this table directly from the Equinox version. It does not ap pear to follow directly any of the versions of the Great Table in the Dee MSS; that is, some letters match the 1584 Great Table as delivered by Avé, some match the 1587 version as reformed by Raphael, and some disagree with both these but agree with the Gr eat Table that can be constructed from the names of the “Parts of the Earth as imposed by God” of Liber Scientiæ using their characters on the Table of Watchtowers (as regards the last, I should note that in the working of 2 nd June 1584 , a week after the o riginal delivery of the Great Table ( TFR p. 188 ), Dee asked Ave “As concerning the diversity of certain words in these Tables and those of the portions of the Earth delivered by Nalvage, what say you?” and was told “The Tables be true.”). Possibly it foll ows a Golden Dawn “correction” of the Tablets. 8 : It is stated (see, e.g. the working of 26 th June 1584 , TFR p. 180 ) that this name and the following should be reversed to call forth and compel the cacodaimons (the three - letter names). 9 : Examples in this and the two following are taken f rom the Water of Water lesser angle. 10 : The rules for prefixing black cross letters to names drawn from the Kerubic and Servient squares are nowhere stated in Chanokh . The rule apparently used by Dee ( vide the lists of names in the “Book of Supplications and Invocations” in Sloane MS. 3191 ) was to use the black cross letter on the same row of the general view of the tablets as the name you were working with; thus only the letters E, X, A, R, P, H, C, O, M, A were thus used. These were used to ( a ) generate Divine Names ruling the angels of the four squares above the bar of the cross in each lesser angle, and ( b ) generate the names of cacodaimons from pairs of letters below the bar of the cross."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"LIBER LXXXIV 39 The Golden Dawn rule, per contra (apparently deriving from Sloa ne 307 ), was to refer one of the four lines of the “Tablet of Union” to each Watchtower; thus EXARP to Air, HCOMA to Water, NANTA to Earth and BITOM to Fire. The first letter of each row was prefixed to names drawn from the Kerubic squares of each lesser angle, the second to names drawn from Servient squares of the Lesser Angle of Air, the third to names drawn from the Servient squares of the Lesser Angle of Water, the fourth to names drawn from the Servient squares of the Lesser Angle of Earth, and the fi fth to names drawn from the Servient squares of the Lesser Angle of Fire. As Crowley gives no examples it is not clear which system he intended. 11 : The following is all derived from Golden Dawn teaching rather than the Dee manuscripts. 12 : Columns CXXXIII to CXXXVI. 13 : More precisely, each square is referred to the Sephirah modified by the element of the Lesser Angle; or to that Sephirah in the Qabalistic world corresponding (thus Fire – Atziluth, Water – Briah, etc. ). Regardie gives the positions of Bina h through to Geburah differently; Zalewski ( 1990 ) gives the same reading as Chanokh , stating this arrangement appears in Westcott’s Notanda to the G.D. Enochian papers. 14 : In addition the upper six are referred to the Planets according to the scheme in 777 col. CXXIV, “The Heavenly Hexagram,” and to the Tarot Trumps corresponding. 15 : See Regardie (ed.), The Golden Dawn , vol. IV. 16 : Suit by element of lesser angle, rank by element of column; so in the Lesser Angles of Water, the square with the left and rig ht sides referred to Fire is attributed to the Knight of Cups. 17 : Each square is additionally referred to one of the 16 figures of Geomancy, and to one of the Signs or Elements (Saturn replacing Earth as per the dual attribution of the Path of Tau), and th ence to the Hebrew letter and Tarot card corresponding: thus Row Column Attributions Fire a Puer h IV – The Emperor Water d Populus j VII – The Chariot Air g Puella l VIII – Justice Fire (Cardinal signs) Earth j Carcer u XV – The Devil Fire e Fortuna Minor f XI – Strength Water h Rubeus n XIII – Death Air k Tristesia x XVII – The Star Water (Fixed signs) Earth b Amissio w V – The Hierophant Fire i Acquisitio s XIV – Temperence Water l Laetitia q XVIII – The Moon Air c Albus z VI – The Lovers Air (Mutable signs) Earth f Conjunctio y IX – The Hermit Fire B Cauda Draconis c XX – The Last Judgement Water C Via m XII – The Hanged Man Air D Fortuna Minor a 0 – The Fool Earth (Elements) Earth ' ( E ) Caput Draconis t XXI – The Universe ( If using the Book of Thoth attributions, exchange h and x and change titles of Tarot Trumps accordingly. The remaining six Trumps and Hebrew letters are referred to the upper six squares of the calvary crosses as noted above). 18 : Rather than reproduce the version of the alphabet which appeared in the Equinox publication I have substituted a face based on the final corrected forms of the letters from Sloane 3188 ( Quinti Libri Mysteriorum Appendix ), “cleaned up” very slightly; note that the letter x (X) is d rawn with a small dot just inside the angle to clearly distinguish it from a rotated or reflected e (E), and in the letter c (C), the stroke in the middle of the right - hand"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"NOTES 40 part of the letter joins the vertical line. Most Enochian typefaces generally used do not reflect this; this is unfortunate, since Dee’s angels insisted strongly on the correct orthography of the letters. 19 : See in particular the Book of Enoch ; though at the time of the Dee - Kelly workings this was known only by reputation in Europe. 20 : In Liber Scientiæ this column is headed “Parts of the Earth as imposed by God.” Crowley’s gloss is based on the statement in True Relation (spelling modernised) that the Call of the Thirty Aires summons the “ 91 Princes and spiritual Governers, unto whom t he earth is delivered as a portion. They bring in and depose Kings and all the governments upon the Earth, and vary the nature of things with the variation of every moment; Unto whom the providence of Eternal Judgment is already opened. These are generally governed by the 12 angels of the 12 tribes, which are also governed by the 7 who stand before the presence of God.” ( TFR p. 139 - 140 ; working of 21 st May 1584 ). A passage in Latin immediately following appears to indicate that it is the Angels of the 12 T ribes who are the governers of the 91 parts, some having many, some fewer, under their rule (“Per tota terra distributa sub 12 Principibus Angelis, 12 Tribuum Israel: quorum 12 aliqui plures, aliqui pauciores partes habent sub sua regimine ex 91 partibus i n quas tota terra hic demonstratur esse divisa.”), suggesting that the seven - letter names in this column are the names of the Parts themselves rather than denoting discreet angelic entities associated with the Parts. The names of the 91 Parts were delivered on the 21 st and 22 nd of May 1584 ( TFR pp. 141 - 5 , 148 - 152 ). The Equinox publication omitted the nu mbers of the 91 Parts; however as these numbers are used to identify their characters on the Table of Watchtowers (Plate X) they have been restored. TheAngels of the Tribes are as follows : Angel Tribe Quarter O LPAGED Dan East G EBABAL Asshur East S - E L AVAVOTH Gad South S - E Z IRACAH Reuben South Z URCHOL Simeon South S - W Z INGGEN Zebulon West S - W H ONONOL Judah West A LPUDUS Issachar West N - W A RFAOLG Ephraim North N - W Z ARNAAH Manesseh North C ADAAMP Benjamin North N - E Z ARZILG Napthali East N - E James ( 1984 ) gives a set of attributions of these to the signs of the Zodiac which results in a rather strange arrangement of the signs around the circle of the quarters; as I am not sure what his source for it was, it is here omitted. An alternate arrangement appears in Zalewski ( 1990 ), based on some notes by Mathers to a Golden Dawn lecture on the astrological attributions of the 12 Tribes, but this appears to disregard Dee’s attribution of Angels to Tribes and quarters; it is thus also omitted. 21 : While this reading agrees with TFR and Turner’s typeset of Liber Scientiæ (James’ typeset of Liber Scientiæ has DIALIOAI which is blatantly wrong at it has one letter too many) the character on the Great Table will read DIALOIA on the 1584 and 1587 tables (or the ve rsion in Chanokh ). James in his table of Ayres gives a slightly different character which will give DIALIOA . "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"LIBER LXXXIV 41 22 : “Every letter in Paraoan is a living fire; but all of one quality and of one creation; But unto N is delivered a viol of Destruction, according to that part that he is of Paraoan the Governour.” – Ave, during the working of 2 nd July 1584 ( TFR p. 188 ). Previously (p. 176 ) Ave remarked of the reversed ‘P’ in the first Watchtower, “for beginning there it will make the name of a wicked spirit.” 23 : T hus in the Equinox publication. James’ typeset of Liber Scientiæ has ORCANIR which is consistent with the 1584 Great Table; however, reading the appropriate sigil off the table as given in Plate III will give ORANCIR ( as does the 1587 Great Table) . 24 : The Equinox publication had ORPAMB which has been changed as an obvious typo, since it has the wrong number of letters. The reading given is from James’ typeset of Liber Scientiæ and also matches Plate III and the 1584 Great Table; the 1587 “reformed” Great Table gives CRPANIB . 25 : The Equinox publication had TAONGLA which has been changed as a typo: the reading given is from typesets of Liber Scientiæ , and is consistent with the 1584 Great Table. The table in Plate III gives TAAOGLA . The reformed Great Tabl e gives TAAOGBA . 26 : Thus in the Equinox publication; this reading is consistent with the table in Plate III . Liber Scientiæ (according to James’ typeset) has DOXINAL ; this reading, however, is not consistent with either of the Great Table versions in Sloa ne 3191 , both of which give DOXMAEL . 27 : More normally given as T HAHEBYOBEAATANUN (some of the vowels are interpolations to make it pronouncable; the name as initially constructed – see note below – is ThHBYBAATNN). 28 : These names are derived by the Golden Dawn from the perimeter of the Sigillum Dei Æmeth by an excruciatingly complex process which it is not necessary to describe here. 29 : The numbers identifying sigils may be a modern interpolation; Turner and James do not give them. The bar across the star t of each sigil marks the start point; the arrowhead the finish point. In some of the characters some doubling - back is necessary. Character 59 is drawn making the first stroke top left to bottom right, the second left to right, and the third bottom to to p. The character numbered 65 forms the name of LAXDIZI who is not mentioned in Liber Scientiæ ; according to Turner ( 1989 ) this character is the sigil of PARAOAN , 65 . Part II 1 : The attribution of the first eighteen Calls to the Tablets is either a Golden Dawn innovation or derives from an intermediate source. 2 : This from G.D. pronunciation rules. AC has also adopted, without mentioning it, other elements of these rules: ‘Z’ is always pronounced extended as ‘zod’ or ‘zoda’; g is pronounced either hard or soft; i may be pronounced as a vowel, ‘i’, or a consonantal ‘y’. c is generally be pronounced hard, although in some of the calls it is transliterated as ç in which case it is pronounced soft. An alternate discussion of Enochian pronunciation issues may be found in Laycock ( 1978 ). 3 : The following text of the Keys or Calls is a phonetic rendition, inserting vowels where necessary according to the G.D. pronunciation rules. Note that final ‘e’s are pronounced separately. The English translations have been slightly modified from those in the Dee MSS, in addition to the modernisation of spelling. 4 : Thus in Equinox printing; in the Dee MSS and most other printed editions the word vonpho ( vonupeho ), “wrath” appears at this point. This omission was probably a ccidental. 5 : All other printed sources I have been able to consult (except those deriving from Chanokh ) give loholo . I am not sure where Crowley got sobolo from. 6 : Vooan was originally received, here and also in the Third Key, but Dee was informed at th e time by Nalvage that: “Vooan is spoken with them that fall, but Vaoan with them that are, and are glorified. The devils have lost the dignity of the sounds.” 7 : A doubtful reading; the Dee MSS have “a strong Seething.”"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"NOTES 42 8 : In the Dee MSS, avavago is gloss ed simply “the thunders” in the Eighth Key; but in the Fourth Key it is glossed “thunders of increase” (as opposed to Coraxo , “the thunders of judgement and wrath” in the Tenth Key). 9 : The translation in the footnote is more plausible. ozol ( ozodola in the phonetic rendition) is likely to be a compound of zol , glossed “hands” in the First Key. collal ( colalala ) is not elsewhere attested, but is glossed “sleues” in the Dee MSS. 10 : Much confusion in this passage. In Sloane 3191 the translation of part of this sentence is in the margin rather than intralinearly. I am not sure of the source for the “echoing” gloss. 11 : There is an apparent lacuna in the Enochian: the translation has English words with no corresponding Angelic (see note below). A tentative suggestion (Tyson, 1998 ) is od aldon od noas ( od aladonu od noasa ). 12 : According to James ( 1984 ), “and they gathered them together in” was in the margins of Sloane 3191 ; Denning & Phillips ( 1986 ), have “and they gathered themselues together and became.” T he reading in Chanokh is erroneous; the missing words clearly go before “salman teloch” (“the House of Death”). 13 : sic. , should be “reign.” dasonuf ( dsonf ) is a contraction of ds (which) and sonf (reign). 14 : “be friendly unto me” inadvertently omitted at this point; but the closing formula of Keys 13 - 18 is identical in the originals; that is, Dee was simply told to repeat the same formula. 15 : See TFR p. 199 - 200 (working of 11 th July, 1584 ). Compare also this statement by Nalvage prior to the delivery of t he Calls (spelling as in TFR ): “ I am therefore to instruct and inform you, according to your D octrine delivered, which is contained in 49 Tables. In 49 v oy ces , or c allings : which are the Natural Key e s to open these, not 49 but 48 (for One is not to be ope ned) Gates of Understanding, whereby you shall have knowledge to move every Gate , and to call out as many as you please, or shall be thought necessary ... ” (working of 12 th April 1584 , TFR p. 177 ). 16 : Disregard Crowley’s footnote. There is no indication in the digests or in TFR that this name should be varied according to the Aire being invoked, and there is no particular connection betwee n the name I DOIGO , which appears on the vertical bar of the cross in the Air of Air sub - quadrant, and the First Aire; the names of the Parts contained in the First Aire are all drawn from the Water Tablet. There was some confusion in the communication of this name, it was initially gives as I DUIGO but corrected shortly afterwards. 17 : Possibly a compositor’s error for moooahe ; other printed versions of the Calls give moooah here (the final ‘e’ is just a product of Crowley’s phonetic rendering). 18 : A variant translation of this Call appears in The Vision and the Voice , Second Æthyr: this includes a few glosses by Crowley as well as some reinterpretations of a couple of phrases ( e.g. , orsba od dodrmni zylna , “drunken and vexed in itself” is rendered “ecstasy a nd irritation of orgasm”).
