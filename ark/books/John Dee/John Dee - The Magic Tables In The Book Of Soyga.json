There are no recognizable auctor es . Other than the o ccasional men tion of a few Old T estamen t names, and t w o references to Libr o Geb er , and a puzzling marginal gloss `Steganographia' in the same hand as the text, whic h is presumably a reference to the w ork of Johannes T rithemius (1462{1516) , there are no references to recognizable p ersonalities. 15 Instead, it mak es n umerous references to what are presumably medi- aev al magical treatises, w orks suc has lib er E , lib er Os, lib er dignus, lib er Sip al, lib er Munob, and the lik e. Throughout the b o ok m uc h imp ortance is placed on writing w ords bac kw ards. This can b e seen in some of the titles men tioned ab o v e: Sip al bac kw ards is L apis, and Munob rev ersed is Bonum. Phrases suc h as `Retap Retson' o ccur throughout. This principle is re\rected in the form of the tables, as discussed b elo w. The name of the w ork, Soyga , is itself explained to b e `Agy os, literis transv ectis'. 16 Throughout the b o ok there is a preo ccupation with letters and com- binations of letters, assignmen ts of n umerical v alues to letters, assigning letters to planets and to elemen ts, listing com binations of letters asso- ciated with houses of the mo on, recom bining letters and syllables in incan tations to form new magic w ords, listing new names for the 23 letters of the Latin alphab et, sometimes tak en in rev ersed Z through A order, listing new sym b ols for the 23 letters, and so on. And, to w ards the end of the b o ok there is the set of thirt y-six large square tables, describ ed in section 2 of this pap er, \flled with a seem- ingly random jum ble of letters.

Top R o w: Fill in the remaining 35 cells of the top line, w orking from left to righ t, rep eatedly applying the form ula X = W + f ( W ) : In our example, the \frst application of this form ula yields n + f ( n ), that is, the letter f ( n ) = 14 places after n in the 23 letter alphab et, whic his d .

The second application yields d + f ( d ). Since f ( d ) = 5, this giv es us i , the \ffth letter after d .W rite an i in the third cell of the top ro w. The third application yields i + f ( i ). Since f ( i ) = 14, this giv es us z , the 14th letter after i .W rite a z in the fourth cell of the top ro w.

The cop yists made new mistak es when transcribing so m uc h appar- en tly unpatterned text. F ortunately for us, these t w o kinds of errors ha v e radically di\u000beren t consequences. If a cell in the original is miscalculated, the mistak e sp oils the calculation of the cells to its righ t and b elo w it, resulting in an a v alanc he of error with an easily recognizable rectangular shap e. A mere cop ying error, ho w ev er, will not ha v e a cum ulativ e e\u000bect, and will b e classi\fable in to one of sev eral familiar t yp es: transp osition, deletion, ey e skip, and replacemen t. In short, the constrain ts placed on the tables b y the X = N + f ( W ) form ula allo w an aggressiv e form of textual emendation of the receiv ed tables in Bo dley 908 and Sloane 8. A similar tec hnique has b een used to trace cop ying of logarithm tables b y Charles Babbage (1792{1871), but is of course not generally applicable. 23 Only texts with a w ell-de\fned mathematical structure are amenable to this metho d of detecting and correcting errors of generation and transcription. 5.1.

Ov erall, there seems to b e a 3/4% cop ying error rate in going from A to C, a 1/2% error rate in going from C to Sloane 8, and a 1/3% error rate in going from C to Bo dley 908. The same tec hniques can b e used to see what relation Dee's cop y of the eigh t Soyga tables app earing in Sloane 3189, the Bo ok of Eno ch , has to Bo dley 908 and Sloane 8. In the \frst place, the T13 of Sloane 3189 sho ws the same mistak ein applying the N + f ( W ) form ula (in ro w 18, column 2) presen tinthe T13 of A. Hence ev en if not copied directly from Bo dley 908 or Sloane 8, the So yga tables in Sloane 3189 are, lik e those of Bo dley 908 and Sloane 8, ultimately deriv ed from A. A fortiori , they are copies of the Soyga tables, rather than simply creations inspired b y , or in the same st yle as, the Soyga tables. Secondly , the T2 of Sloane 3189 lac ks the gross ey e skip error found in ro w 3 of T3 of Bo dley 908. This suggests Sloane 3189 w as not copied from Bo dley 908, but not strongly so: the ey e skip error o ccurs in the rep eating baxibaxi area and could ha v e b een corrected b y a naiv e but alert cop yist. Third, lo oking only at lo cations where all four of A, Bo dley 908, Sloane 8 and Sloane 3189 supply legible v alues, I found the results in m yT able VI. The agree-disagree coun ts seem to mak e Sloane 3189 sligh tly but insigni\fcan tly closer to Bo dley 908 than to Sloane 8. F ourth, and more tellingly , the transp osition error in T3 of Bo dley 908, where there is a kq instead of the correct qk in ro w 22, is not presen t in the T3 of Sloane 3189. Unlik e the T2 ey e skip error, this error is w ell outside the area of rep eating motifs, and so uncorrectable b y a naiv e cop yist. On balance, then, it seems that the Soyga tables in Dee's Bo ok of Eno ch , Sloane 3189, are closer in man uscript transmission to Sloane 8 than to Bo dley 908. pap11send. tex ;                                  7/05/1998;                                  9:04;                                      no                                        v.;                                      p.18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Magic T ables in the Bo ok of So yga 19 T able VI.

The text is inscrib ed in the tables line b y line, left to righ t, one letter p er cell, with no space b et w een w ords. The eigh t Soyga tables app earing in the same b o ok are of course patterned, but with a hidden pattern; it is tempting to b eliev e that Dee's fa v ourite table size, 49, w as inspired b y the size of the Soyga tables, 36, since 49 = 7 \u0001 7 is the next p erfect square after 36 = 6 \u0001 6. Similarly there are 36 Soyga tables and, as Kelley informed Dee on 24 Marc h 1582/1583, there are to b e 49 Eno c hian tables. 30 There are man y large patterned tables in one of Agrippa's Cabalistic c hapters. 31 They include: an angel c hart of no in terest to us, a `righ t table of comm utation', an `a v erse table of comm utation', an `irrational a v erse table of comm utation', a `table of Ziruph', and a `rational table of Ziruph'.

Agrippa's third table of comm utation, the `tabula a v ersa dicat irra- tionalis' is a more complex Latin square.

It is also p ossible that for Y ates, magic tables | unlik e texts or images | are not sub ject to the pro cesses of cop ying, em ulation, impro v emen t, and confusion; that is, they are neither v ehicles for ideas nor p oten tial sources of evidence in in tellectual or cultural history . 26 Raphael P atai, The Jewish A lchemists (Princeton: Princeton Univ ersit y Press, 1994), pp. 277{288. 27 Menso F olk erts, `Zur F r uhgesc hic h te der magisc hen Quadrate in W esteuropa', Sudho\u000bs A r chiv , 65 (1981), 313{338 giv es a detailed surv ey of the genre.

It is barely p ossible that T rithemius receiv ed the idea of suc h tables from Agrippa, p ossibly when they met in the win ter of 1509/1510. In 1510 Agrippa sen t T rithemius a draft of his De o c culta philosophia whic h, according to Compagni (p. 58), lac k ed the c hapter con taining the Ziruph tables and tables of comm utation. T rithemius's use of the tabula recta is purely cryptographic, and most prin ted w orks on cryptograph yev er since include suc h diagrams, often under the name of `Vigen \u0012 ere table'. Since Agrippa's text do es not discuss his tables of comm utation it seems more lik ely , absen tan y further direct evidence, that Agrippa copied from T rithemius. 34 Johann Reuc hlin, De A rte Cab alistic a (Hagenau, 1517), Bo ok I I I, sig.

This is a cryptographic w ork, and P orta tables are almost as m uc h a \fxture in cryptographic literature as Vigen \u0012 ere tables. P orta's table is based on a 22 letter Latin alphab et with the letter K omitted. In P orta's table but not in the Ziruph table letters from the \frst half of the alphab et are paired only with letters from the last half. 36 There app ears to b e one deviation from this pattern. In the sev en teen th ro wof b oth Reuc hlin's and Agrippa's tables the letters sade and r esh are paired, as are tet and taw . The rule used to pro duce the rest of the table w ould pair taw with sade and pair tet with r esh . 37 British Library , Additional MS 6782, fols. 27, 28, with asso ciated calculation on fol. 57.
