Beside these, the booke intituled, The 48 Claves Angelicae , also, Liber Scie ntia Terrestris Auxilij & Victoria (these two being those very individuall bookes which the angells commanded to be burnt [1] , & were after restored [2] by them as appeares by the printed Relation of Dr: Dee's Actions with Spirits pag: 418 & 419) The booke intituled De Heptarchia Mystica Collectaneorum Lib: Primus , and a book e of invocations or Calls, begining with the squares filld with letters, about the black cross. These 4 bookes I have bound up in another volume [3] . All which, were a few daies before deliver ed to my said servant, for my perusall (I being then at Mr: William Lillies house at Hersham in Surrey) by my good freind Mr: Thomas Wale, one of his maiesties warders in the Tower of London. The 5t: of Sept: following Mr: Wale (having heard of my retourn e to towne) came to my office in the Excise Office in Broadstreete, & told me he was content to exchang all the foresaid bookes, for one of myne, vizt: The Institution, Lawes & Ceremonies of the most Noble Order of the Garter , to this I agreed, and provide d one, which I sent him fairely bound, & gilt on the back [4] . On the 10th: of the said Sept: Mr: Wale came thither to me againe, & brought his wife with him, from her I received the following account of the preservation of these bookes, even till"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"they came to my hands, vizt: That her former husband was one Mr: Jones a confectioner, who formerly dwelt at the Plow in Lumbardstreet London, & who, shortly after they were married, tooke her with hi m into Alde streete among the joyners, to buy some houshold stuff, where (at the corner house) they saw a chest of cedarwood, about a yard & halfe long, whose lock & hinges, being of extraordinary neate worke, invited them to buy it. The master of the shop told them it had ben parcell of the goods of Mr: John Woodall Chirurgeon (father to Mr: Thomas Woodall late Serjant Chirurgeon to his now Maiestie King Charles the 2d: (my intimate friend) and tis very probable he bought it after Dr: Dee's death, when his goods were exposed to sale. Twenty yeares after this (& about 4 yeares before the fatall fire of London) she & her said husband occasionally removing this chest out of its usuall place, thought they heard some loose thing ratle in it, toward the right ha nd end, under the box or till thereof, & by shaking it, were fully satisfied it was so: Hereupon her husband thrust a peece of iron into a small crevice at the bottome of the Chest, & thereupon appeared a private drawer, which being drawne out, therein wer e found divers bookes in manuscript, & papers, together with a litle box, & therein a chaplet of olive beades, & a cross of the same wood, hanging at the end of them. They made no great matter of these bookes &c: because they understood them not, which oc casioned their servant maide to wast about one halfe of them under pyes & other like uses, which when discovered, they kept the rest more safe. About two yeares after the discovery of these bookes, Mr: Jones died, & when the fire of London hapned, though the chest perished in the flames, because not easily to be removed, yet the bookes were taken out & carried with the rest of Mrs: Jones her goods into Moorefields, & being brought safely back, she tooke care to preserve them; and after marrying with the fo resaid Mr: Wale, he came to the knowledge of them, & thereupon, with her consent, sent them to me, as I haue before set downe.

As a further testimony of the sence of Mr. Wales kindnes, short ly after his death, I sent for his son, & bestowed on him, one of my deputies places in the Excise, with an allowance of 80 £ p Anum.
