This Commentary, the third of the series, is like the pre- vious volumes (\"Commentary on Matthew\" and \"Com- mentary on John,\" by the same author) drawn entirely from the Theological Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. For every passage of the Psalms which is therein quoted or re- ferred to, all that he has written is given, except in isolated cases where abridgments have been necessary to avoid making the Commentary too bulky for ready reference, or for topical reading. Reiterations of the same statements have been avoided by a reference to preceding chapters and verses. The entire part of Swedenborg's treatise \" Summary Ex- position of Prophets and Psalms\" which relates to the Psalms is embodied in this Commentary and appears under the indicative letters P. P. at the verses to which it belongs. This work throws new light upon many portions of the Book of Psalms. In the \" Doctrine concerning the Lord,\" No. 37, Swedenborg writes about it: \"It maybe well to mention that it has been granted to me to go through all the Prophets and the Psalms of David, and to examine each verse singly and to see what is there treated of. It has been seen that nothing else is treated of but the church established and to be established by the Lord, the Lord's advent, His combats, glorification, redemption and salvation, and heaven from Him; and at the same time their opposites.\" The division into verses is that adopted in Schmidt's Hebrew Latin Bible, published in 1740, which Swedenborg"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"IV PREFACE generally used, and which is the same as in Le Boys des Guays' General Index, and other similar works. In these the introductory words which for some Psalms occur in the Hebrew are counted as a verse. Where it occurs, the verse number of the text issued by the American Revision Com- mittee can be found by going one verse back. No mis- understanding is possible as the context always shows which verse is meant. It is needless to repeat what has been said in the preface to previous volumes about the unique use of this Concord- ance, as that is now well established.

For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish. Psalm I. 1. To walk, to stand, and to sit are here mentioned, be- cause one follows another, for to walk is expressive of the life of the thought from intention, to stand is expressive of the life of the intention from the will, and to sit of the life of the wall, thus of the \"Esse\" of the life.

A. 885. W T aters in the internal sense of the Word signify truths. A. 2702. By a tree man is signified; and because man is man from affection which is of the will, and from perception which is of the understanding, therefore these also are signified by a tree. There is also a correspondence be- tween a man and a tree, on which account there appear in heaven paradises of trees which correspond to the affections and thence to the perceptions of the angels. R. 400. Rational truths are signified by leaves, because by all the parts of a tree are signified corresponding things in man. . . . With those who are in the goods of love and at the same time in the truths of wisdom there appear (in the spiritual world) fruitbearing trees, luxuriant with beautiful leaves. R. 936. Trees in general signify such things as belong to man, leaves signify the truths belonging to him, and fruits the goods. E. 109.

P. i, 2, 6. The Lord was conceived of the Divine itself, and was afterwards born of that. Hence it is that He was not only conceived, but was also born of Jehovah. Ath., Page 39. 1,2, 6, 7, 8, 12. By the Anointed of Jehovah is here under- stood the Lord as to the Divine Human. These things in the sense of the letter are said concerning David, but by David in the Word is understood the Lord as to Divine truth, or as King. It is also evident that the subject here treated of is concerning the advent of the Lord, and in particular concerning the last judgment accomplished by Him, and afterwards concerning His Kingdom over all things of the world. The spiritual things which lie con- cealed and are signified in the particulars of these passages are these; the nations made a tumult, and the people meditated vanity signify the state of the church and of the former heavens, that it was to pass away, nations standing for those who are in evil, and the people for those who are in falses. The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers consulted together against Jehovah, and against His Anointed, signifies the falses of the church and the evils thereof, as being altogether against the Divine good and the Divine truth, thus against the Lord. The kings of the earth stand for the falses of the church, and the rulers the evils thereof. Jehovah stands for the Lord as to the essential Divine, thus as to the Divine good.

Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee, signifies the Lord as the Anointed, Mes- siah, Christ and King, thus as to His human conceived and afterwards born of His essential Divine or Jehovah. To-day signifies a statute from eternity and thence refers to the conjunction and union accomplished in time. Ask of me, and I will give the nations for thine inheritance, and the encls of the earth for^thy possession, signifies His kingdom and dominion over all things of heaven and the church, which shall be His. Kiss the Son, signifies con- junction with the Lord by love, to kiss stands for conjunc- tion from love. Lest He be angry and ye perish in the way, signifies lest evils invade you and ye be condemned, for to be angry when it is said of the Lord signifies the aversion or turning away of men from Him, consequently their anger and not the Lord's, and evils are the things which avert themselves and afterwards are angry. Be- cause His anger will kindle shortly, signifies the last judg- ment and casting of the evil into hell. Blessed are all they that confide in Him, signifies salvation by love and faith in, the Lord. E. 684. 2. As Christ and Messiah are the same, and as Christ in Greek and Messiah in Hebrew signify Anointed, it is evi- dent that Christ is the same as Anointed, and likewise the same as King, for kings in general were called the anointed.

His anger will shortly burn signifies the last judg- ment from Him. D. P., Page 58. 2, 6. Among the ancients, when all external worship was performed by representatives, namely by such things as represented the interior principles which are of faith and of love from the Lord and to Him, thus which are Divine, anointing was instituted for the reason that oil, by which anointing was performed, signified the good of love. A. 9954. The kings of the earth stand for falses, and the rulers for evils which are from the hells, against which the Lord, when He was in the world, fought and which He con- quered and subdued. The Anointed of Jehovah is the Lord as to the Divine Human, for from that He fought. Zion the mountain of holiness, over which He is said to be anointed for a king, is the celestial kingdom, which is the good of love, and which is the inmost of heaven and the inmost of the church. A. 9954. Oil signifies celestial good. The reason why anointing with the oil of holiness was commanded is because oil signified the good of love, and represented the Lord, who as to His Human is the very and the only Anointed of Jehovah, anointed not with oil, but with the Divine good itself of the Divine love. R. 779. They afterwards anointed kings and they were called the anointed of Jehovah. The reason why kings were anointed was that they might represent the Lord as to judgment from Divine truth.

Psalm xl. 7: Genesis iii. 14, 15, etc. Coro. 60. 6-8, 12. To these may be added some passages which speak more openly of the coming of the Lord. See also Isaiah vii. 14: Matthew i. 22, 23: Daniel vii. 13, etc. L. 6. That heaven and the church where the Lord alone is worshipped are signified by mount Zion, may be evident. R. 612. Mount Zion signifies heaven and the church where the Lord reigns by His Divine truth. To announce concern- ing the statute (decree) signifies His advent. Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee, signifies the Divine Human, which is also the Son of God. That He hath all power in the heavens and in the earth is understood by verse 8. That there must be conjunction with Him by love in order to salvation is signified by verse 12. The last judgment from Him is signified by, His anger will kindle shortly. They shall be saved who have faith in Him is signified by, happy are all they who put their trust in Him. E. 850. 7. To-day manifestly stands for eternity. A. 2838. To-day denotes that the Lord's coming is present. Hence also it is that an entire period is called in the Word a day, its first state twilight and morning, and the last evening and night. R. 4. Since God is in all time without time, therefore in His Word He speaks of the past and of the future, in the present. T. 30.

Can., Page 43. 7. 12. Neither is a Son from eternity meant here, but the Son born in the world, for this is a prophecy concerning the Lord who was coming, and therefore it is called a de- cree which Jehovah announced to David. This day is not from eternity, but in time. L. 19. Here is not meant a Son from eternity, but the Son born in the world, for it is prophetical of the Lord who was to come, wherefore it is called the decree which Jehovah de- clared to David. T. 101. From the foregoing now comes this conclusion, that every one who wishes to be truly a Christian, and to be saved by Christ ought to believe that Jesus is the Son of the living God. He who does not believe this, but only that He is the Son of Mary implants in himself various ideas concerning Him which are hurtful and destructive of that state of salvation. T. 342. They alone have faith who believe in the Lord, and others have no faith. T. 384. 8. In this Psalm it is written before, I have anointed my King upon Zion, and it follows, I will give to Him the na- tions for an inheritance. T. 101. 9. A rod of iron stands for the power of spiritual truth in natural, for all natural truth in which there is spiritual truth has power. Iron is natural truth. A. 4876. By a rod or staff in the Word power is signified, and by iron natural truth, consequently the natural sense of the Word, and at the same time the natural light (lumen) of man. In these two the power of truth consists. R. 148. It is said \"the vessels of a potter\" because by them are signified the tilings which are of one's own intelligence, all of which are falsities, and in themselves of no account.

A potter's vessel stands for those things in the natural man which are from self-derived intelligence. Being broken to shivers stands for to be dispersed, for dispersion is predicated of falsities as breaking to shivers is predi- cated of a potter's vessel. E. 177. That a rod and a staff signify power, and indeed the power of Divine truth arises especially from their being branches or boughs of trees, which signify the knowledges of truth and good, which are the truths of the natural man, and as they also support the body, they signify power. This is still more the case with a rod of iron, because iron signifies the truth of the natural man. By virtue of its hardness it signifies power which cannot be resisted.

By kings here are not meant kings, but they who are in Divine truths from the Lord, and abstractly the Divine truths from which is wisdom. R. 20. Kings signify those who from the Lord are principled in truths derived from good. E. 31. 10-12. Kings stand for those who are in truths, and from truths they are often called the \"king's sons.\" \"The Son\" here stands for the Lord, who is here called the Son because He is the truth itself, and all truth is from Him.

The reason why anger grounded in the affection of evil"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"IO PSALM II. 12 is fire, is because anger is from that source, for when what a man loves is attacked the fiery principle bursts forth, and as if it were burns. Hence it is that anger is described in the Word by fire and is said to burn. Anger is attributed to Jehovah, that is to the Lord, but it appertains to man. A. 9143. The Lord is here called a Son from the truth of faith, which is from Him. A. 9309. Where a last judgment is impending the Lord with heaven draws near, and of those who are below in the world of spirits only those can endure the Lord's coming who are interiorly good. That the day of the Lord's anger signifies the last judgment is plainly manifest. R. 340. For His anger will shortly burn. D. P., Page 71. PSALM III.

In various passages of the Word mention is made of foes and enemies, and thereby are understood evils and falses, by foes evils and by enemies falses; for the Word in its interior is spiritual, wherefore no other than spir- itual foes and enemies can be there understood. E. 671. 5. The Lord in heaven and hence heaven itself is called \"the habitation of holiness,\" and also \"the mountain of holiness,\" inasmuch as the Lord alone is holy. A. 9229.

That to inflict a blow or to smite the cheek means to destroy truths is plain from passages in the Word, where mention is made of smiting the cheek. And because in the genuine sense it signifies the destruction of truth, therefore in the opposite sense it signifies the destruction of falsity, in which sense it occurs here. A. 9048. The teeth of the wicked to be broken stand for the falsities by which they destroy truths. A. 9052. That teeth signify the ultimates of the life of man which are called sensual things, which when they are separated from the interiors of the mind are in mere falsities and offer violence to truths, and destroy them, may be evident.

The expression \"to answer\" frequently occurs in the Word and when predicated of the Lord signifies influx, inspiration, perception and information, likewise mercy and aid. See Isaiah xlix. 8.

In these passages spiritual things are signified by the reins, and celestial things by the heart, that is the things which are of truth are signified by the reins, and those which are of good by the heart. The reason of this is that the reins purify the serum, and the heart purifies the blood itself. Hence by trying, exploring and searching the reins is signified to try, explore and search out the quantity and quality of truth, or the quantity and quality of faith in man. A. 5385. By the kidneys are signified truths exploring, purifying and chastising. This signification is grounded in their function. To search and prove the kidneys stands for to explore the truths of faith, and to search and prove the heart stands for to explore the goods of love, for the heart stands for the good of love.

It is here attributed to God that He is angry with the wicked, that He whets His sword, that He bends and makes ready His bow, prepares instruments of death, and ordains His arrows, but in the spiritual sense it is under- stood that man acts thus to himself. Those things are attributed to God in the sense of the letter, because that sense is natural and for the natural man, who believes that God is to be feared on account thereof, and fear with him operates the same as love does afterwards when he be- comes spiritual. Hence it is evident what is here signified by those words, namely, that the wicked are angry with God, that they whet the sword against themselves. By their whetting the sword is signified, that they procure to themselves falsity by which they fight against truth. By their bending the bow and making it ready is signified, that from falsities they make to themselves doctrine against truths.

This is said of the Lord whose dominion over man and over the things pertaining to man is thus described. Otherwise, what would be the dominion over beasts and fowls? A. 776. The subject here treated of is the Lord and His power over all things in heaven and in earth. By flocks and herds are signified the interior and exterior goods apper- taining to men, and by beasts the affections appertaining to them. A. 10609. 7-9. So long as a man is spiritual his dominion proceeds from the external man to the internal — see Genesis i. 27-. But when he becomes celestial and does good from love, his dominion proceeds from the internal man to the external, just as the Lord says in David of himself, and thus at the same time of the celestial man who is His like- ness.

Since the affections and thence the perceptions and the thoughts of spirits and angels in the spiritual world appear at a distance in the forms of the animals or creatures upon the earth which are called beasts, of the creatures in the air which are called birds, and of the creatures in the sea which are called fishes, therefore beasts, birds, and fishes are so often mentioned in the Word, by which however nothing else is meant. This verse is said concerning the Lord. R. 405. In these places men as to their affections are signified by beasts. R. 567. Birds signify the things which are of the understanding and thence of thought and design. This is clearly mani- fest from birds in the spiritual world. R. 757. Here the subject treated of is the Lord and His Divine power over heaven and earth. By the sheep and oxen, the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea are understood men, spirits and angels as to things spiritual, and things natural pertaining to them. By the fish of the sea are understood those who are in the ulti- mates of heaven. E. 342. These things are said concerning the Lord, and concern- ing His dominion. That He has dominion over the angels in the heavens and over man on the earth is known from the Word, for He himself says — see Matthew xxviii. 18-; but that dominion was given to Him over animals, birds and fishes is not of sufficient importance to be mentioned in the Word, where all, even the most minute things, have respect to heaven and the church.

Spiritual things in the Word are expressed by natural things, for the Word in its interior is spiritual.

By the flocks are signified in general all spiritual things with man, by the herds natural things with him, which correspond to spiritual, by the beasts of the fields the affections of good in the natural man which are of the church, for a field signifies the church.

As most of the things in the Word also have an opposite sense, so likewise have javelins, darts, arrows, bows, and a shooter. They signify falsities, the doctrine of falsity, and those who are in falsity. A. 2709. A bow signifies the doctrine of truth combating against falsities, and in the opposite sense, the doctrine of falsity combating against truth. Hence arrows and darts signify truths or falsities. Since war in the Word signifies spir- itual war, the arms of war, therefore, as the sword, the spear, the shield, the buckler, the bow, the arrows signify things belonging to such war. R. 299. The wicked bending the bow signifies their framing doctrine, their making ready their arrow upon the string signifies their applying to doctrine falsities which appear as truths. To shoot privily at the upright in heart signi- fies to deceive those who are in truths from good. Bow here means the doctrine of what is false, arrow stands for falsity itself. To shoot means to deceive, and to do so privily denotes appearances, for they reason from appear- ances in the world and from fallacies, applying also the • literal sense of the Word.

It is manifest that Jehovah in no wise caused it to rain brimstone and fire, that is in no wise condemned to hell, but that they who were in evil and thence in falsity did this, because they separated themselves from good and so cast themselves upon the laws of order from truth alone.

Fire and sulphur are the evils of the love of self and of the worM. A. 9348. As a nearer and stronger Divine influx through the heavens disperses the truths that are with the evil, there- fore wind signifies the dispersion of the truth with them, and thence their conjunction with hell and their destruc- tion.

By vials, plates, cups, and goblets, and by bottles those things are signified which are contained in them. R. 672. By storms, and tempests is signified the dispersion of falsities and evils, because they who are principled in the falsities of evil are cast down into hell by a stormy wind. E. 419. These things are said from the appearances which take place in the spiritual world when the Divine good and truth descend out of heaven towards the inferior parts there, where the evil are, who are to be separated from the good and to be dispersed. Since the fire, which in its origin is Divine love, when it descends out of the heavens and is received by the evil becomes a consuming fire, therefore such fire in the Word is predicated of Jehovah. Infernal fire is from no other source than the change of the Divine love into evil loves, and into direful lusts of in- juring and doing evil. E. 504.

Whilst man is in life from the Lord he is in a state of watching, or wakefulness, but when he is in life from self he is in a state of sleep; or what is the same, whilst man is in spiritual life he is then in a state of watching or wake- fulness, but when he is in natural life, separate from spir- itual, he is in a state of sleep.

That a song also signifies glorification, which is confes- sion from joy of heart, is because singing exalts, and causes the affection to break forth from the heart into sound, and to present itself intensely in its life. The Psalms of David are nothing else but songs, for they were played and sung, on which account also they are in many places called songs. R. 279. It is to be observed that all the instruments here men- tioned — Psalm cl. 1-5 — signify affections, and each has respect to its particular affection, and this from the con- cordance of their sound, for the affections are what pro- duce the variety of sounds with men. Therefore the affec- tions are also known by the sounds. The sounds of the musical instruments mentioned elevate the affection, and the truths form it, as is also known to those skilled in music. For this reason the writings of David are called Psalms and also songs, for they were played and sung with the addition of the sounds of various instruments. E. 326. 1-3 et seq. That the exalting of Jehovah, that is of the Lord was practised by songs is plain in David. A. 8261. 1-4, 7. Confidence of the Lord from His Divine against the hells. P.

By a rock and fortress when predicated of Jehovah, or the Lord, is signified omnipotence. \"In whom I will trust,\" signifies defence. \"My buckler and the horn of my salvation\" signify salvation thence derived.

Here the earth stands for the church, which is said to shake and to tremble when it is perverted by the falsifica- tions of truths, and in this case the foundations of the mountains are said to shake and to be moved, for the goods of love which are founded upon the truths of faith then vanish. Mountains stand for the goods of love, and their foundations for the truths of faith. E. 304.

The state of an evil man when he is angry is similar to that of smoke, which when fire is applied to it conceives flame, for the false of evil in the intellect is as smoke, and anger is like a flame of kindled smoke. There is also a correspondence between them. Hence it is that in the Word smoke stands for what is false, and the flame thereof signifies anger. A. 9144. Where it is said that there is a fire from Jehovah which consumes the wicked, and that Jehovah acts from the fire of wrath, of anger and of fury, it is not meant that it is from Jehovah, but from the infernal love of the wicked. Such things are said in the Word because they are appear- ances, and the Word in the sense of the letter is written by appearances and correspondences. R. 494. Smoke in the opposite sense signifies what is false from evil, because the fire by which that smoke is occasioned, signifies evil of love. E. 494. 9, 10. Fire stands for the hatreds and smoke for the falsi- ties which are in men, which are attributed to Jehovah or the Lord. A. 1861. See Psalm xi. 6. Add: evil, hell and the devil do these things, by no means the Lord, who is mercy itself and good itself, but because He appears to do them therefore . . . they are attributed to Him. A. 2447. In these passages it is not meant that a smoke and a devouring fire ascended from Jehovah, for there is no wrath in Him, but it is thus said because the Lord so ap- pears to those who are in falsities and evils, for they view Him from their own falsities and evils.

The sense of the letter of the Word is a guard for the genuine truths which are concealed within. It is a guard in this respect that this sense may be turned hither and thither, and explained according to one's apprehension, and yet without hurt or violence to its internal. This guard is signified by cherubs. To ride upon cherubs and to sit upon them means upon the ultimate sense of the Word. S. 97. By the cherubs the Divine truth in the ultima tes as a guard is signified. To ride upon the cherubs, to sit and to be seated upon them is upon the ultimate sense of the Word. R. 239. The wings of the wind are the Divine truths which flow in. R. 343. Since by cherubs is signified the Word in the ultimates, and also a guard it is therefore said \" Jehovah bowed the heavens, and came down, and rode upon a cherub.\" To ride upon cherubs, and to sit upon them means upon the ultimate sense of the Word. T. 260. Because it is the Divine proceeding from the Lord which provides and guards, therefore it is said concerning the Lord that He dwelleth between the cherubim. E. 277.

That nevertheless the Divine truth, such as it is in the heavens is in that sense, is sig- nified by setting darkness for His hiding place.

A. 9509.. See Psalm xvii. 8. R. 245. The understanding of the Word is meant by a horse. God rode upon a cherub. R. 298. By flying when in the Word it is predicated of the Lord is signified omnipresence, since omnipresence is infinite circumspection and infinite presence. E. 282. By Jehovah riding upon a cherub is signified His Di- vine providence.

The thick darkness under His feet means that the things which appear to man are darkness in comparison — such is the literal sense of the Word. To ride upon a cherub means that it was so provided. To put darkness round about Him for tents, or His surroundings for His tent means the holy of truth in its hiding place, namely within the literal sense. The gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies are the Word in the letter. A. 4391. 11-13. The cherubs also signify the W T ord. A tent sig- nifies a dwelling. R. 24.

In these passages by hailstones and coals of fire are signified falsities and evils destroying the truths and goods of the church.

Now, because after the union of the Human with the Divine in himself, which was like that of the soul and the body in man, there were no longer two but one person, according to the doctrine of the Christian world, therefore the Lord as to both is Jehovah and God, wherefore it is sometimes said Jehovah and the' Holy One of Israel, the Redeemer and Saviour, and sometimes Jehovah the Re- deemer and Saviour. L. 34. That the Lord is called Jehovah is manifest from these passages. L. 38. These passages prove that Jehovah and the Lord are one, and because they are one, and not two, that the Lord from eternity who is Jehovah himself, is by the assump- tion of the Human the Redeemer and Saviour.

From these passages — Isaiah xlviii. 17; xliii. 14: Psalm xxxi. 5, etc., and very many others every man who has eyes, and whose mind has been opened by means of them can see that God, who is one, descended and became man for the purpose of accomplishing the work of redemption. T. 83. Statement of R. 962 repeated in T. 188. The spiritual sense of the first commandment is, that no other God than the Lord Jesus Christ is to be wor- shipped, because He is Jehovah, who came into the world and wrought the redemption, without which no man and no angel could have been saved. T. 294. In that primeval time (the Apostolic Church) all in what was then the Christian world acknowledged that the Lord Jesus Christ was God, to whom was given all power in heaven and earth, and power over all flesh, ac- cording to His own express words. T. 637. Redemption stands for deliverance from damnation. This vindication and liberation was effected by the Lord's subjugating the hells. The continual vindication and liberation is effected by His having glorified His Human, that is having made it Divine, for thereby the hells are kept continually subjugated. This is what is signified by His redeeming man, and by His being called in the Word a Redeemer. E. 328. Here by \"O Jehovah, my rock\" is signified the same as by Jehovah God, namely the Lord as to Divine good and Divine truth, and He is called Redeemer from regen- eration, which is effected by Divine truths.

E. 710. 11.

Since in ancient times the gladnesses which excelled all others were spiritual gladnesses, that is from affections of spiritual loves which were those of good and truth, there- fore also it was then allowed to adjoin dances to songs and musical harmonies, and so likewise in these ways to testify joy. This is why dances are mentioned in the Word, and thereby are signified gladnesses of affections for truth, or faith from good or charity. A. 8339. Since in the Word internal things are described by ex- ternal, so also the joys and gladnesses which are in the interiors of man by plays — or sports — and dances. A. 10416. Mourning on account of vastated truth in the church was represented by putting on sackcloth. R. 492.

Now because such persons — who have lived in evil — - expose themselves to the evil of punishment and to hell, they therefore suppose that this proceeds from the Lord, and that He regards them with a stern countenance, and casts them down into hell, and punishes them nearly in the same way as a man who is in anger, whereas the Lord never regards any one but from the purest love and mercy. It is from the above appearance to the evil, that the ex- pressions in these passages are used in the Word. E. 412. 19. The reason why to approach stands for conjunction and presence is, because in the other life the distances of one from another are altogether according to the dis- similitudes and diversities of the interiors, which are of thoughts and affections. God is said to be nigh at hand to those who desist from evil. A. 9378. 22. They that use violence shall be held guilty. A. 376. 22, 23. Guilt is the blame or imputation of sin and of transgression against good and truth. Thus guilt stands for all sin which remains, its separation by good from the Lord is redemption. A. 3400. 23.

In these passages by fighting, taking hold of shield and buckler, and drawing out the spear is not signified to use those arms of war, since they are spoken of concerning Jehovah.

By a buckler, since it defends the breast, is signified de- fence against the falses which destroy charity, which is the will of good.

By these words is described the worship of the Lord from truths originating in good. The worship of the Lord from spiritual truths and goods, and the pleasure of the soul thence derived is signified by verse 2, and by \"beau- tiful in elevation\" in verse 3. Worship is understood by being \"great and greatly to be praised.\" Spiritual truth which is from spiritual good is understood by \"the city of our God.\" The mountain of His holiness, and the pleasure of the soul thence derived is understood by \"beautiful in elevation,\" or for situation. Worship from celestial good is understood by \"the joy of the whole earth is mount Zion.\" Truths from that good are under- stood by, \"on the sides of the north the city of a great king.\" The sides of the north mean truths from celestial good, and the city of the great king, the doctrine of truth thence derived.

Hence it is that withering and drying up are ascribed to this wind. The east wind also destroys all things where the evil are, their earths, their habitations, and their treasures, for the reason that in the spiritual world these are corre- spondences of the states of those who dwell there, where- fore when they perish the things which correspond perish also.

He who thinks spiritually may know that Jehovah is present in His Divine truth, for this proceeds from Him, conse- quently that this is here understood by clouds. There- fore also it is said that Jehovah makes the clouds His chariot, for by a chariot is signified the doctrine of truth. E. 36. Since chariots and horses signify doctrine from the Word and the understanding thereof, and since all doc- trine of truth and the understanding thereof are out of heaven from the Lord, therefore it is said concerning Him that He rides upon the Word, upon clouds, upon heaven, upon a cherub, also that He causes to ride.

In the Word of the Old Testament when the sub- ject is the celestial things of love or good, it is said Je- hovah, but when it is the spiritual things of faith or truth, it is said God. When both together are treated of it is said Jehovah God. The name Lord Jehovih is used when the aid of omnipotence is more especially sought and implored, as in Isaiah xl. 9-1 1. A. 2921. 6. The signification of that which openeth the womb is that which is born immediately of that which is regener- ated, thus what is from charity. For he who is conceived anew comes as it were again into the womb, and he who is born anew goes forth as it were again from the womb, but that what is conceived in the womb and born from the womb is not man as man, but the faith of charity, for this makes the spiritual of man, thus as it were the man himself anew, for then his life is thence derived.

The Lord is called the shepherd of Israel because He instructs and leads. By Joseph are understood those of the church who are in truths derived from good. Thou that dwellest between the cherubim, signifies the Lord above the heavens, whence He sends forth the light which enlightens the minds of angels and men, hence it is added, \"shine forth.\" That the light of truth may penetrate even to those who are in natural truths and good, thus to the ultimates or lowest in the church is signified by, \"before Ephraim and Benjamin"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"PSALM LXXX. 301 and Manasseh stir up thy strength.''

The vine out of Egypt in the supreme sense stands for the Lord, the glorification of His human being described by it and its branches. In the internal sense the vine is here the spiritual church, and the man of that church, such as he is when made new or regenerated by the Lord as to the intellectual and voluntary. The boar in the wood is the falsity, and the wild beasts of the field are the evil which destroy the church as to faith in the Lord. A. 51 13. 9, 10, 12. By the vine out of Egypt is signified the church, which the sons of Israel represented. By driving out the nations is signified to expel the evils of the natural man, which are expelled by truths. Planting it, purging before it and causing its roots to take root signifies instruction according to order, namely, the imbibing scientifics and knowledges, then the being as in a wilderness and tempted, and afterwards introduced into the land of Canaan, which is the church.

By the vine are understood the children of Israel who are called a vine because they represented the spiritual church, which is signified by a vine in the Word. Their tarrying in Egypt represented their initiation into the tilings of the church, for Egypt represents the scientifics subservient to the things of the church.

The boar signifies the evil lusts of the natural man, and the wild beast of the field falsities. E. 3 SS. By wild beasts in the opposite spiritual sense are sig- nified lusts of the false from evil, and by birds the thoughts and reasonings thence. Since the man of the church thereby spiritually perishes, therefore everywhere in the Word where the vastation of the church is treated of, it is said that they shall be given to the wild beasts and the birds to be devoured.

David spake these words concerning himself and concerning the church, which is the sense of the let- ter, for he understood himself by the shoot and by the son, but in the spiritual sense by the vine and by the shoot which Jehovah planted is signified the spiritual church, represented by the sons of Israel. By the son whom He made strong for himself is signified the truth of doctrine from the Word. By verse 18 is signified the truth of the Word in the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter, and the same in the spiritual sense, which is the internal sense. E. 724. 16, 18.

Mercy in the Word when predicated of Jehovah, or the Lord, signifies the Divine good of the Divine love. By servant is not understood a servant in the ordinary sense, but whatsoever serves. It is therefore predicated of truth, because this serves good for use, and in this case for power. E. 316. 21, 26, 28-30.

Verse 6 the abyss is scientific truth for the natural man. Hence the meaning of verse 9 is evident. The limit is the ultimate of Divine truth into which the interior things terminate, and on which, as on a prop and foundation, they subsist and rest. A. 9433. 1, 2, 19, 20.

By verse 10 is signified that the Lord from the truths of the Word gives intelligence every thing of which originates in the good of celestial love. Springs signify the truths of the Word.

PSALM CXIV. 423 When Israel went forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language: Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan was driven back. The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs. What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest ? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back ? Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; Ye little hills, like lambs ? Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob, Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters. Psalm CXIV. 1, 2.

Since all power belongs to that truth, or to good by truths, therefore it is said that Israel was his dominion. E. 433. 2-7. The departure of the Israelites out of Egypt is de- scribed in these words. The establishment of a church is here understood, or the regeneration of the men of the church, for the church is signified by Israel, and the estab- lishment thereof by their departure from Egypt.
