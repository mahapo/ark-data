At that time John Whitehead, the editor and translator of the two-volume set, called attention in his preface to several situations that have since changed; for instance that the full text of the marginal notes to Swedenborg’s Schmidt’s Latin Bible (1696) was not available for use in his edition. This latter omission was taken care of in another way in 1917 when The Schmidius Marginalia together with the Expository Material of the Index Biblicus of Swedenborg, translated and edited by E. E. Iungerich, was published by the Academy of the New Church. In this present edition of volume 2, the several minor works that Whitehead had appended to Last Judgment (Posthumous) in volume 1, as well as the extracts from Swedenborg’s correspondence and the brief treatise on Gad and Asher, have been moved into this volume. This was done in order to make the two volumes more nearly the same size, as two of the extensive editorial word indexes, the brief bibliography of Swedenborg’s works, and the index of Swedenborg’s works published by the American Swedenborg Printing and Publishing Society formerly found in volume 2 have been omitted, being neither accurate nor any longer relevant to today’s reader. The text for this edition was electronically scanned from the Foundation’s Standard Edition. This process has allowed the book to be completely redesigned and set in a new and more readable typeface. Certain stylistic changes have also been introduced. These include modernized spelling and punctuation as well as substituting new words for terms whose meanings have become obscure or have changed since the nineteenth century. Arabic numerals have replaced roman numerals in Bible passages, and certain capitalized words including pronouns referring to God have been lowercased to reflect contemporary usage. All these changes have been carefully made in order to make the book easier to read and use while preserving the dignity and power of the original Latin. On the whole, however, the Whitehead translation has not been materially altered.

It is impossible to reproduce accurately the peculiar features of the manuscript, in type, and the student is therefore referred to the phototyped edition, published by the Academy of the New Church in the year 1896. Still a description of the manuscript seems necessary for those who may not have access to the phototyped edition. The work lacks a title. In previous editions it was entitled A Summary Exposition of the Internal Sense of the Prophetical Books of the Word of the Old Testament, and also of the Psalms of David, which has been changed to the one used in this edition, suggested by Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 97). The first page of the manuscript is divided into lateral halves or columns, by a perpendicular line drawn from the top to the bottom of the page. About the middle of the first half is the list of works “to be published,” which is similar to the one embodied in Swedenborg’s preface to Doctrine of the Lord, where it is introduced with the words, “Now, pursuant to the command of the Lord, who has been revealed to me, the following works will be published.” In the lower corner of the same column is a “table of subjects.” In the second column are the references to “the Lord’s state of humiliation,” and separated from it by a considerable space are the references to the psalms. The summaries begin on the second page of the manuscript, having at their head a list of six topics. The chapters are not broken into paragraphs, but summary follows summary continuously throughout the chapter, and in this"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 503 manner one or two of the marginal references frequently indicate the contents of two or more propositions, or summaries, which are given, in whole or in part, on the line. It was found impossible to reproduce this arrangement in type, and a plan was adopted for this edition, which appeared to be the nearest and best approach to the manuscript. Each summary is printed in a paragraph by itself, with the marginal references belonging to it. This plan presents the additional advantage of making reference to chapter and verse, as well as to subject, very easy. But this plan made it necessary for the editor to exercise his judgment in assigning the marginal references to each separate summary. In many cases this has resulted in a more frequent repetition of the references than actually occurs in the manuscript. Wherever, in this respect, a question may arise in the mind of the reader, recourse must be had to the original manuscript or its facsimile. Owing, presumably, to the difficulties just adverted to, the references were removed from the margin in the first Latin edition (London, 1784) and in all the English editions, and (except in the edition published in London, 1887) they were made the basis of two indexes, one of which gives the chapters and verses in their order, with the corresponding references to the subjects in the Table, while the other presents the subjects in their order, and classifies all the chapters and verses under them. These indexes are rendered unnecessary by our return to Swedenborg’s own plan. An index to the text of the summaries, however, was considered highly important and useful, and great pains have been taken in the elaboration of such a one. Owing to the succinct wording of the summaries, this index partakes largely of the nature of a concordance. The compiler has endeavored to make it also a topical index, and has arranged the entries under the respective subjects as analytically as was possible, so that it may prove of real value in the study and understanding of the sacred contents of the prophets and psalms. The preliminary Intimations of This Little Work Found in Other Works by Emanuel Swedenborg, have been gathered together for this"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 504 edition, for the better appreciation of the summaries in the light of the heavenly doctrines of the new Jerusalem themselves. The Bibles principally used by Swedenborg were the Latin translation by Sebastian Schmidius originally published in Strassburg in 1696, and a later edition of the same translation, printed in parallel columns with the Hebrew text and published at Leipsic in the year 1740. The division into chapters and verses in the Hebrew-Latin edition varies in at least one instance from that of the Latin edition (see, for instance, Isaiah 15). Both differ frequently from the division adopted in the English Bibles. In order to prevent the confusion experienced heretofore in the use of this little work in Bible study, the English division has been adopted in this translation, all the references to chapters and verses being changed in adaptation to the English Bibles. The divisions of the Hebrew and Latin Bibles, as given in the manuscript, are noted in smaller type, “H.B.” standing for Hebrew Bible (meaning also the edition of Schmidius of 1740), and “L.B.” standing for the Latin Bible (edition of 1696). The grouping of verses in the Hebrew Bible is more logical than that in the English Bible. See the summaries of Isaiah 8, 63, 64; Jeremiah 8, 9; Ezekiel 20, 21; Daniel 3, 4; Hosea 13, 14; Jonah 1, 2, Micah 4, 5; Nahum 1, 2; Malachi 3, 4. As to the difference in the verse divisions of the psalms in the Hebrew and English Bibles, see the note on back of the title page to the psalms. After completing the summaries of the prophets and psalms, Swedenborg began giving the summaries of the internal sense of the historical portions of the Word, and introduced them with a preface—a feature lacking in the earlier parts. Perhaps the memoranda on the first pages were intended as material for one. It has seemed so to us, and we have therefore used them as the basis for an introduction to the work, designed more especially for such readers as have not yet the knowledge of the doctrines of the new church which is required for an intelligent use of this book."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 505 In presenting this important little volume to the public, we feel constrained to join in the following devout sentiment with which the first Latin edition was introduced by the editor: TO THE KIND READER Among some of Swedenborg’s letters we found the following remarkable and noteworthy reference about the present work: Once when I was reading this book, celestial angels were present with me, who rejoiced greatly at heart over my intention of publishing it for the common good of the new church of the Lord Jesus Christ. In order that the joy of the celestial angels may not be vain, we adjudged it highly necessary to make this very useful little book public. Deign to receive the new treasure with a thankful mind, use it with a pious and sincere heart, and live forever. The summaries contained in this work presuppose some knowledge respecting the general subject of the internal sense of the Word of God. The sacred Scripture contains an internal or spiritual sense, which differs from the literal sense in the same way that the things of heaven differ from the things of the world. The literal sense, by which is to be understood the meaning which ordinarily comes to the reader as he peruses the narratives and prophecies of the Scriptures, treats, for the most part, of occurrences in the natural world, such as the history of the Israelitish people, and the history and deeds of our Lord and savior. But the internal sense treats of things heavenly and divine, that is to say, of such things as relate to the soul-life of man, to the church as a spiritual entity, to the angelic life in heaven, and to the inner life of our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 506 The natural sense as a whole is said to “correspond” to the spiritual sense, every single particular of the literal sense corresponding to some detail of the internal sense. The existence of an internal sense may be perceived from many passages in the Scriptures. On the occasion of the memorable journey which the Lord Jesus Christ took after his resurrection, when he met and accompanied the two apostles on their way to Emmaus, Beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. (Luke 24:27) The Lord Jesus Christ here indicates that all the Scriptures treat of him; and if all, then even those passages from the surface meaning or literal sense of which this may not appear, in some hidden way still treat of him. The memoranda on page 4 refer to evidences of this great and most important truth respecting the Lord, which is fundamental to the Christian church, and essential to its life and prosperity. In keeping with this vital truth, the term “the Lord” is uniformly used in this and all the other works of the new Jerusalem to designate the Lord God Jesus Christ. He is the God of the sacred Scripture. He is the one and eternal god incarnate, who assumed the flesh for the purpose of revealing himself in his own personality to mankind, and of meeting, through the assumed human, the hells, whose influence, like that of a successful rebel host, at that time dominated mankind, to the exclusion of all heavenly and even divine influences. The incarnation was for the further purpose of overcoming the hells, and reducing them to subjection and obedience to the Lord. The conflict with the hells, their overthrow, the consequent establishment of order in the spiritual world, the formation of a new heaven, and the derivation therefrom of a new spiritual church on earth to take the place of the Jewish church that had come to a miserable end—all taken together constituted the Divine work of Redemption. These things are treated of throughout the Scriptures. They are brought to view in a general way by the summaries that make up this book. The Lord’s divinity was proclaimed by the angelic messenger who was sent to announce his conception to the virgin Mary,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 507 The angel Gabriel said unto Mary, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the virtue of the most high shall overshadow thee; wherefore also the holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. (Luke 1:5). The babe born of Mary was conceived—not, as we have been led to conclude from the theology hitherto prevailing in the Christian church, by an eternal God the son, the second in a supposed trinity of divine persons—but by the most high, the only God himself. The “son of God” being the appellation given to the human nature born of Mary—the clothing in which the Most high deigned to appear to men, a clothing woven of Mary’s blood and substance. Every human being derives his soul from the father, and his body from the mother. The soul is a graft of the father’s soul, and, like the parent soul, it is not inherently possessed of life, but is a spiritual organism receptive of the life that inflows into all of God’s creatures from him who is the one and only source of life. In the case of Jesus Christ, his soul was not from the Father; it was the Father himself, for the infinite cannot be divided, there can be no offshoot from it; “The Holy Spirit” came upon Mary, “the virtue of the most high overshadowed” her, therefore the holy thing born of her was called “the son of God.” The soul of Jesus Christ was God himself. For this reason, The child born to us, the son given to us, is called “God, the Father of eternity.” (Isa. 9:6) The Lord Jesus Christ testified that the soul that dwelt within him was the everlasting Father, when he said, The Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. (John 14:10) No man would say of his parent that he dwells within him, for the soul of a mortal is not the father, but from the father. And since the Father was in the Lord Jesus Christ, as the soul is in the body, therefore when Philip, who had heard him say so much about the Father, finally asked him, “Show us the Father,” the Lord answered,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 508 Have I been so long time with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? (John 14:8, 9) The Father and the son are frequently spoken of as though they were two distinct beings, and Jesus Christ himself frequently prayed to the Father and referred to him as to a person different from himself. This form of speech is often employed in the following summaries, in adaptation to the language of the New Testament, and we read of many psalms that they are “prayers of the Lord to the Father.” Occasionally the explanation is suggested that this means that the human prayed to the Divine. The human assumed by the infinite God was at first merely human and finite, and hence such a distinction existed between this human and the inner Divine soul, that, in states when the distinction was very evident, the interaction between the two is represented as the speech between two distinct persons. The human, being assumed from a finite human being who shared the hereditary taint of the house and family of David, was itself full of inherited inclinations to evil. But these inherited forms were successively put off, and to the extent in which they were put off, interior and finally Divine forms took their place from the Divine that dwelt within. This process involved alternating states. In the one state the human prayed to the Divine (or the “son” to the “Father”). In the other state the human spoke with the authority and power of the Divine itself. The first state in which “he poured out his soul unto death” (Isa. 53:12), is called the state of “exinanition,” or of “humiliation,” the other state is called the state of “glorification.” The death of merely finite tendencies resulting finally in the death or dissipation of the very material of which the body had been organized, while the body itself remained as an organization of Divine substance, involved the resurrection of this body of organized “flesh and blood,” which flesh and blood was now no longer material, but Divine—the Divine human."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 509 Without the state of humiliation the Lord could not have been crucified, but this state of final exinanition was followed by the state of complete glorification, which, being the state in which the human was lifted up from its finite state into the infinite glory of the Divine itself, and thus united to it, is also called the state of “union.” The Lord was in this state when he was transfigured before the three disciples on the mount, and also when he performed miracles, and whenever he said that the Father and he were one, and that the Father was in him and he in the Father, that all things of the Father are his; and when the union was completed, that he had power over all flesh (John 17:2), and all power in heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18). The glorification of the son, or the union of the human with the Divine, is the very climax of the inner history of the Lord; it is the most excellent of all teachings of the church; it calls for the profoundest veneration. In the following work, summaries that tell of it are especially marked by an “N. B.” placed opposite them in the margin by Swedenborg. (See Ps. 2:10, 12; 24:7–10; 45:7, 8; 72:17; 89:26–29, 35–37; 110:4–7, 132:9, 10.) This sublime teaching of the New Jerusalem has been treated of at some length in this introduction because it is necessary to a proper understanding of the summaries, and also because these two states are especially referred to in the memoranda on page 4 of the text (below), where some of the places in the Gospels, as also in the psalms, referring to these two states, are noted by Swedenborg. These citations are doubtless inserted here in order to show the internal and essential unity of the Word of both testaments—one in that they both witness to the love and wisdom and life of the one Lord God Jesus Christ, who is the true God and eternal life, the God of both testaments. The passages in the Gospels refer to the records of the Lord’s prayers to the Father, indicating the state of his humiliation and the intimate connection of such prayers with the succeeding state of union with the Divine, or glorification of the human. While the literal sense of the Gospels thus witnesses to the two states of the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 510 Lord in his human, the internal sense of the Old Testament, summarized in this work, notably of the psalms, treats of the same states with great fullness. The passages in the psalms referred to on page 4 clear away any doubt that the internal sense of the psalms so treats of the Lord. Let us consider them. In Psalm 69:21 we read, “They gave me gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.” The enlightenment vouchsafed to even the most simple reader enables him to recognize in this verse a prophecy of the Lord Jesus when he was brought to Golgotha to be crucified, and They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall. (Matt. 27:34) David, writing the psalm from inspiration, represented the Lord who was to come into the world, and by referring to his own personality, foretold what would happen to him who was to be: The root and offspring of David (Rev. 22:16), but who was, nevertheless, David’s Lord. (Mark 12:36, 37) The verse in the psalm is not true literally, but it is true prophetically. We are reminded here of the statement in the present work prefatory to the summaries of the psalms, It should be known, that as by David the Lord is meant, so where David speaks in the psalms, the Lord is signified in the spiritual sense. The same remarks apply to the next reference on page 4, Psalm 22:16, 18: Dogs have compassed me about, the assembly of the malignant have surrounded me; they pierced my hands and my feet. I may tell all my bones; they look, they stare upon me. They parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 511 There is no historical evidence, and not the slightest probability, that David, even when most harassed by his enemies, had his hands and feet pierced, and that his garments were divided among his enemies, and lots cast upon his vesture. But when the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, the nails pierced his hands and feet; and they parted his garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, “They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.” (Matt. 27:35) Here David is called outright a prophet. What he had said about himself was not literally true, but it was prophetic of what was done to the Lord. Thus David, as a prophet, represented the Lord. In Psalm 35:19, David says, Let not them that are mine enemies of a lie rejoice over me; neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. On the memorable occasion of the last supper, when the Lord foretold his death, and the hatred borne him, saying, “If I had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin, but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.” He added, “But that the Word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’” (John 15:24, 25) So the Lord Jesus Christ fulfilled in his own person what David had said of himself in a representative capacity, and the Lord’s fulfillment carried with it all the import of Divine love and mercy that had aroused the malignant hatred of his wicked and causeless enemies. And finally, the words in Psalm 118:22, 23: The stone rejected of the builders is become the head of the corner; this is the Lord’s doing, it is wonderful in our eyes, are quoted by the Lord (Matt. 21:42), as applying to himself."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 512 Since, then, from the recorded fulfillment of these Old Testament prophecies it is clear that David wrote prophetically of the Lord, representing him in his own person, we may justly conclude that all of the psalms treat of the Lord, and that this is what is meant by the Lord’s expounding “in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.” And if David so represented the Lord when he spoke in the psalms, why not when he is spoken of in the two books of Samuel and in Kings? David’s enemies represented the Lord’s enemies, not only the Jews, that, like dogs, compassed him about and clamored for his life, but principally the powers of evil in hell from whom come evil influences to men on earth. David’s prayers and lamentations represented the Lord’s prayers and temptations; David’s victories over his enemies represented the Lord’s victories over the hells, over Satan and the Devil; David’s exultant psalms voiced prophetically the joy of the Lord over the accomplishment of the glorious work of redemption. And since David as king and as prophet represented the Lord, is it unreasonable to conclude that all the other prophets and kings likewise represented him? The hard things that the prophets often bore but represented the cruel things which the Word, and thus the Lord as the Word, bore from his rebellious and sinful people. The prophets represented the Lord; the people, and even the land itself, represented the church. Everything written in the Word has reference to the Lord: From Isaiah to Malachi there is not anything which is not about the Lord, or in the opposite sense, opposed to the Lord. ( Doctrine of the Lord, n. 2) The state of the church is gauged by its knowledge and acknowledgment of the Lord, and therefore the Word treats also of the states of the church. In the following summaries, while those of the psalms treat more especially of the Lord, those of the prophets treat more especially of the states of the church. All the spiritual contents of the prophetical books may be summed up in the six propositions given on page 6 of the text, stated more fully in the extract from Doctrine of the Lord (n. 3), quoted below."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 513 The internal sense of the Word, being free from the many paradoxes and appearances of truth of the literal sense, and presenting the Divine truth in the light in which it appears to the angels in heaven, constitutes the doctrine of genuine truth for the church. For this reason the general summing up of the internal sense on page 6 agrees perfectly with “the faith of the new heaven and the new church in its universal form,” which is prefaced as “face, gate, and summary” to True Christian Religion, Containing the Universal Theology of the New Church, where it is given in the following comprehensive form: The Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, came into the world tha t he might subjugate the hells and glorify his human. Without this no mortal could have been saved; and they are saved who believe in him. The place of this work in the general system of the doctrines of the new Jerusalem is made clear by an analysis of those works which present the internal sense in serial form, namely, Arcana Coelestia, Apocalypse Revealed, and Apocalypse Explained. Apocalypse Revealed offers a good example. Here, at the head of every chapter, we find the “spiritual sense of the contents of the whole chapter”; then follow the “contents of the single verses,” and finally the elaborate explanation adapted to the reason and understanding of man, and confirmations and illustrations from the literal sense of the Word and from the phenomena of nature and experiences of human life. The summaries contained in the work before us answer to the “Contents of the whole chapter.” These summaries give, therefore, the key to the internal sense of all the prophets and psalms. These contents are the guide for applying the knowledge of correspondences which gives the spiritual signification of the particular words of sacred Scripture. By following this guide, the danger of violating the spiritual sense by exploring it from one’s own intelligence may be guarded against, of which danger we have the following wholesome warning:"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 514 By means of some correspondences known to man he can pervert that sense, and even force it to confirm falsity; and this would be to offer violence to Divine truth, and thus also to heaven in which it dwells. ( True Christian Religion, n. 208, 230) The use of the summaries in connection with the reading of the sacred Scriptures seems to be indicated in teachings like the following: The Word conjoins man to heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, since all things in the sense of the letter correspond to things celestial and spiritual in which are the angels, with whom there is no communication if the Word is applied only according to the letter, and not at the same time according to some doctrine of the church, which is the internal of the Word. ( Arcana Coelestia, n. 9410) From the first chapter of Isaiah to the last of Malachi, and in the psalms of David, every verse communicates with some society of heaven, and thus the whole Word with the universal heaven. ( True Christian Religion, n. 272) If man knew that there is an internal sense and would think from some knowledge of it when he is reading the Word, he would come into interior wisdom, and would be still more conjoined with heaven because he would thereby enter into ideas like the angelic ones.

(1) That the Lord came into the world in the fullness of times, which was when he was no longer recognized by the Jews, and because of this, when nothing of the church yet remained, and unless the Lord had then come into the world and revealed himself, man would have perished in eternal death; for he says in John: Unless ye believe that I am, ye shall die in your sins. (John 8:24) (2) That the Lord came into the world to effect a last judgment, and thereby subjugate the hells then dominant, which was done by combats, that is, by temptations admitted into his human from the mother, and by continual victories at that time; and unless the hells had been subjugated no man could have been saved. (3) That the Lord came into the world to glorify his human, that is unite it to the Divine which was in him from conception. (4) That the Lord came into the world to establish a new church, which should acknowledge him as the redeemer and savior, and be redeemed and saved by love and faith in him."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 516 (5) That at the same time he set heaven in order, so that it might make one with the church.

While I read the Word through from the first chapter of Isaiah to the last of Malachi, and the psalms of David, and kept my thought on their spiritual sense, it was given me to perceive clearly that every verse communicated with some society of heaven, and thus the whole Word with the universal heaven from which it was evident, that as the Lord is the Word, heaven is also the Word, since heaven is heaven from the Lord, and the Lord, through the Word, is all in all of heaven. Concerning the Word, n. 10 That all things of the Word correspond to all things of heaven has been granted me to perceive from this, that every chapter in the prophetic Word corresponds to a particular society of heaven; for when I went through the propheticals of the Word from Isaiah to Malachi, it was granted me to see that the societies of heaven were stirred up in their order and that they perceived the spiritual sense corresponding to them; from these and from other evidences it was made clear to me that there is a correspondence of the entire heaven with the Word in a series.

The spiritual and celestial of the Word conjoined to its natural, what it is (verses 8, 9). The Divine love of celestial, spiritual, and natural good and truth therein, separately and together (verses 10, 11). They look to a one (verse 12). The sphere of the Word from the Lord’s Divine good and Divine truth, from which the Word has its life (verses 13, 14). The doctrine of good and truth in the Word and from the Word (verses 15–21). The Divine of the Lord above it and in it (verses 22, 23). And from it (verses 24, 25). The Lord is above the heavens (verse 26).

(See also Apocalypse Revealed, n. 239.) Apocalypse Revealed, n. 859 As the spiritual sense has been disclosed to me, it shall be opened . . . what those things signify that are contained in chapters 38 and 39 of Ezekiel. In chapter 38 in Ezekiel are these things: Those are treated of who are in the sense of the letter of the Word only, and in a worship therefrom that is external without any internal. This is “Gog” (verses 1, 2). All things and each thing of that church will perish (verses 3–7). That worship will invade the church, will vastate it, and thus it will be in externals without internals (verses 8–16). The state of the church is consequently changed (verses 17–19). The truths and goods of religion will therefore perish, and falsities will take their place (verses 20–23). In chapter 39 of the same are these things: These who are in the sense of the letter of the Word only and in external worship will come into the church. These are “Gog,” but they will perish (verses 1–6). This will take place when the Lord comes and establishes a church (verses 7, 8). This church will then disperse all their evils and falsities (verses 9, 10). It will utterly destroy them (verses 11–16). The new church that will be established by the Lord will be instructed in truths and goods of every kind, and will be imbued with goods of every kind (verses 17–21)."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"SUMMARIES OF THE INTERNAL SENSE 519 And the former church will be destroyed on account of evils and falsities (verses 23, 24) Then a church will be gathered together by the Lord from all nations (verses 25–29). But something shall be said about those who are in an external worship without internal spiritual worship. Apocalypse Revealed, n. 43 In Zecharia h (chap. 4), the “candlestick” signifies a new church to be established by the Lord, since it signifies the new house of God, or the new temple, as appears from what there follows, and by the “house of God” or the “temple” is signified the church, and in the highest sense the Divine human of the Lord, as he himself teaches (John 2:19–21 and elsewhere). But it shall be told what is signified in order in chapter 4 of Zechariah when the “candlestick” was seen by him: The things contained in verses 1 to 7 signify the enlightenment of the new church by the Lord from the good of love by means of truth, “olive trees” signifying here the church in respect to good of love. The things in verses 8 to 10 signify that these things are from the Lord, “Zerubabel,” who was to build the house, thus the church, representing the Lord. The things in verses 11 to 14 signify that in that church will also be truths from a celestial origin. This explanation of that chapter has been given to me through heaven by the Lord.

As the series of things in that chapter and in the two that follow in that prophet has been disclosed to me through the spiritual sense, it shall be stated, but in a brief summary. In chapter 12, in Zechariah, in the spiritual sense it is set forth: That the Lord is to form a new church (verse 1). That there will then be nothing of doctrine in the old church and therefore they will shun it (verses 2, 3). That there will be no longer any understanding of truth except with those who are in the Word, and who are of the new church (verse 4). That these will learn good of doctrine from the Lord (verse 5). That the Lord, by means of the truths of the Word, will then destroy all falsities, so that the doctrine of the new church may teach nothing but truth (verses 6, 7). That the church will then be in doctrine concerning the Lord (verse 8). That then he will destroy all men and all things opposed to that doctrine (verse 9). And that there will then be a new church from the Lord (verse 10). And that all things and each thing of the church will then be in mourning (verses 10–14). These are the contents of chapter 12 in the spiritual sense. The contents of the following chapter [13] are as follows: That the Word will be for the new church, and it will be open to them (verse 1).

These are the contents of chapter 13 in the spiritual sense. The contents of chapter 14 are as follows: Concerning the combats of the Lord against the evil, and their dispersion (verses 1–5). That there will then be no truth, but from the Lord [there will be] Divine truth (verses 6, 7). That Divine truth will go forth from the Lord (verses 8, 9).

In Tafel’s edition, however, the subjects are arranged alphabetically, following the Latin subject headings. In this translation the order of the subjects is that of the original manuscript. The parentheses at the beginning and the end of certain paragraphs were introduced by Tafel to indicate that the author crossed his pen over the parts so marked; it is probable that he did so when he used them in his published writings.

Look upon Zion the city of our appointed feast: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, which shall not be dissipated, the stakes thereof shall never he removed; there Jehovah will be magnificent to us (Isa. 33:8–10, 15, 16, 20–22). Here concerning the vastation of the church, and afterwards the coming of the Lord to restore it. All the host of the heavens shall waste away, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll, and all their host shall fall. The"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"SCRIPTURE CONFIRMATIONS 770 spoonbill and the bittern shall possess it, and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein, and thorns shall grow over her palaces, the thistle and the brier in the fortresses thereof, so that it may be a habitation of dragons, a court for the daughters of the owl. And the zijim shall meet with the ijim, and the satyr shall meet his fellow; yea, the screech owl shall rest there, and shall find for herself a resting place. For it is the day of the vengeance of Jehovah, the year of the recompense for the controversy of Zion. Its fire shall not be quenched night nor day, from generation to generation it shall lie waste (Isa. 34:4, 8, 10, 11, 13–15). Concerning the complete vastation of the church as to charity or as to good; there follow the coming of the Lord and the restoration of the church in the following chapter; where are these words: Rejoice, O wilderness and dry place, in blossoming let it blossom and exult: behold, your God will come with vengeance, he will come with the retribution of God. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be opened. Then shall the lame leap as a hind, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; yea, in the wilderness shall waters break out, and rivers in the plain of the wilderness. And the dry place shall become a pool and the thirsty place springs of water. An highway shall be there and a way, which shall be called the way of holiness. Thus the redeemed of Jehovah shall return and come unto Zion with singing, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head; gladness and joy shall follow, sorrow and sighing shall flee away (Isa. 35:1, 2, 4–8, 10). These words treat of the coming of the Lord and the state of heaven and the church after redemption. 16. (I will desolate and swallow up together. I will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their herb; I will make the rivers islands and will dry up their pools; I will lead the blind by a way they knew not; I will make darkness light before them and the crooked places straight. Hear, ye deaf, and look, ye blind, that ye may see [Isa. 42:14–16, 18]. Of the desolation and afterwards of the enlightenment in Divine truths.)

Bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears (Isa. 43:5–8). Concerning the new church of the Lord after the redemption. Behold I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert; the wild beasts of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls, for I have given waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert to give drink to my people, my chosen (Isa. 43:19, 20). Concerning the new church after the completion of the redemption. He will say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited, and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof, saying to Jerusalem, Be thou built; and to the temple, Be thy foundation laid (Isa. 44:26–28). (Thy destroyers, and thy devastators shall go forth from thee. For as for thy waste and thy desolate places, they that swallow thee up shall be far away [Isa. 49:17, 19].) These two things have befallen thee, devastation and breaking; thy sons have fainted, they have lain at the head of all the streets (Isa. 51:19, 20). Jehovah will console all the waste places of Zion, so that he maketh her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah, joy and gladness shall be found therein, confession and the voice of singing (Isa. 51:3). The heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall grow old like a garment, but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be broken (Isa. 51:6). Behold I will set thy stones with antimony, and lay thy foundations in sapphires.

In justice shalt thou be established (Isa. 54:11–14). Concerning the new church of the Lord: almost as the new Jerusalem after the redemption is it described in Revelation such as it would be. This is treated of in the preceding verses 5–8. Thus said Jehovah, Keep ye judgment and do justice, for my salvation is near to come and my justice to be revealed (Isa. 56:1). Concerning the coming of the Lord. 17. The vastation of good and truth and thence their change into evil and falsity in the church are treated of as described in Isa. 59:1–16; and it is said that vastation and breaking are in their paths (verse 7). Afterwards in the same chapter the coming of the Lord and the redemption are treated of from verses 16–21, where it is also said, Jehovah saw that there was no man, he wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him, and his justice upheld him. And he put on justice as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head: he also put on garments of vengeance, and covered himself with zeal as with a cloak; anger to his enemies, retribution to his adversaries. So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun. Although he shall come as a rushing stream, the spirit of Jehovah shall bring in an ensign against him; then the redeemer shall come to Zion. This is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah, my spirit that is upon thee, and my words, which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, from henceforth and for ever (verses 16–21). In the following chapter (60) the church of the Lord is treated of, after the judgment upon the evil, thus after the act of redemption, concerning which we read as follows: Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee. For, behold, darkness covers the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but Jehovah shall rise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. Lift up thine eyes round about and see: they all gather together and come to thee.

Thou shalt suck the milk of the nations, and shalt suck the breasts of kings, that thou mayest know that I Jehovah am thy savior and thy redeemer, the powerful one of Jacob. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, vastation nor breaking within thy borders, but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. The sun shall no more be for a light by day, nor shall the moon shine for brightness unto thee, but Jehovah shall be for the light of eternity, and thy God, thy adornment (Isa. 60:1–22). Concerning the new church of the Lord. 18. The state of the church is continued by the Lord (Isa. 61) because he will restore all things; as follows: then shall they build the wastes of eternity, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall renovate the waste cities, the desolation of a generation. And ye shall be called the priests of Jehovah, the ministers of our God. I will give them the reward of their work in truth, and I will make a covenant of eternity with them (Isa. 61:1–11). Afterwards the state of the church is treated of after the second coming and after the redemption at that time. This church is the New Jerusalem treated of in Revelation. Concern ing it we read these words in Isaiah: for Zion’s sake I will not be silent, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest until her justice go forth as brightness, and her salvation shall burn as a lamp. Then shall the nations see thy justice, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name. Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal tiara in the hand of thy God. Thou shalt no more be called forsaken, and thy land shall no more be called a waste, but thou shalt be called my good pleasure is in her, and thy land shall be married. For Jehovah shall be well pleased in thee, and thy land shall be married. As the joy of the bridegroom over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.

Go through, go through the gates, prepare ye the way of the people. Behold, Jehovah hath made it to be heard to the end of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, behold thy salvation shall come, behold his reward is with him, and the price of his work before him. They shall call them, the people of holiness, the redeemed of Jehovah; and thou shalt be called, A city sought out, not deserted (Isa. 62:1–12). 19. In the following chapter (63), the combat of the Lord with the hells and their subjugation is treated of, where we read these words: Who is this that cometh from Edom, with sprinkled garments from Bozra? this that is honorable in his apparel marching in the multitude of his strength. I that speak in justice, great to save. Wherefore art thou red as to thy garments and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winepress? I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there was no man with me: therefore I trod them in mine anger and trampled them in my wrath, whence their victory is sprinkled upon my garments and I have stained all my raiment. For the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is come. I had looked round, but there was none to help, and I was astonished, but there has none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me. And I trod down the peoples in mine anger and I made their victory to descend upon the earth. He said, surely they are my people, so he became their Savior. In all their straitness, there was straitness for him, and the angel of his faces freed them. On account of his love and his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old (Isa. 63:1–9). The supplication of the faithful to the Lord, that then they might be liberated from the hells (verses 15-19), where we read these words: Look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and thy beauty: where are thy zeal and thy powers? the yearning of thy bowels and thy compassions are restrained towards"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"SCRIPTURE CONFIRMATIONS 775 me.

O that thou wouldst rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence (Isa. 63:15–19). The lamentation of the faithful that the church was laid waste, and supplication that he would bring help (Isa. 64:1–11, where are several things which can be taken therefrom). The reply of the Lord to their supplication (Isa. 65), where first the evil who have not worshiped God but have gone away to the worship of other gods, are treated of (verses 1–15), and afterwards the restoration of the New Church, which is meant by Jerusalem, and its happy state (verses 17–25), where are these words: Behold I create new heavens and a new earth, so that the former shall not be remembered. But be glad and exult in that which I create, behold I will create Jerusalem an exultation and her people a gladness. They shall not labor in vain nor bring forth in terror, for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. They shall not do evil, nor destroy in all the mountain of holiness (Isa. 65:17–25). 20. For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish, and the nations shall be utterly wasted (Isa. 60:12). Of the Lord. Then shall they build the wastes of eternity, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall renew the waste cities, the desolations of a generation (Isa. 61:4).

Behold I create new heavens and a new earth so that the former things shall not be remembered nor come upon the heart. But be ye glad and exult forever in that which I create: behold I will create Jerusalem an exultation and her people a gladness, so that I will exult over Jerusalem and be glad over my people. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, but dust shall be the serpent’s bread. They shall not do evil, nor destroy in all the mountain of my holiness (Isa. 65:17–25). Concerning the new church.

For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son. Moreover, whom he predestined and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified. Who shall accuse God’s elect? It is God that justifieth (Rom. 8:28–30, 33).

Since we are not under the law, but under grace, is it permitted to sin? Be it far from us. Since we are dead to sin, how shall we live in sin? but in newness of life. Wherefore sin shall not reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof; but present your members as servants of justice unto holiness (Rom. 6:1, 2, 4, 10–16, 19, 20, 22; 7:4–7).

God sent the Son that the justification of the law might be fulfilled in those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.

The nations have attained to justice, justice which is of faith (Rom. 9:30). 2. The animal man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, and he cannot know them (1 Cor. 2:14). The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God (1 Cor. 3:19). Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you (1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19, 20)? Ye are washed, sanctified and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus by the Spirit of our God (1 Cor. 6:11).

Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but that we are sufficient is from God, who hath made us sufficient as ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter but of the spirit: for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life (2 Cor. 3:5, 6).

Jehovah said, Is my hand shortened at all that there is no redemption? or is there no power in me to deliver? I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering (Isa. 50:2, 3). Redemption is to snatch the good from the evil, and to separate the evil from the good, otherwise the evil would destroy the good.

So shall the redeemed of Jehovah return, and they shall come with singing unto Zion, so that the joy of eternity shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away (Isa. 51:10, 11). Redemption is represented by the crossing of the Egyptians through the Red Sea against the children of Israel.

Love truly conjugial is represented in heaven by various things. It is represented by adamantine auras; sparkling as if from rubies and carbuncles; also by most beautiful rainbows and golden rains, which, when they are beheld, fill the bystanders with such pleasurableness and such delights, that they affect the inmosts of the mind. I have heard the angels, when conjugial love was so represented in the paradises of heaven, say that they were filled with such delight, that they could not express it otherwise than that it was delight itself, from which, as from their origin, all the rest of delights arise; and this delight was said to be a pure delight of the mind without any excitation of lust, for such is conjugial love in its origin. 2. Since love truly conjugial is in its origin pure delight itself of the mind, and that love is the fundamental of all loves, and from love is all the beauty of the angels in heaven, for love or the affection of love forms everyone, wherefore every angel is as to his face the image of his love or affection, hence it is that all the beauty of the angels in heaven is from their conjugial love; for the inmost of their life which shines through is thence. An angel was seen by me, who was in pure conjugial love (he was from the third heaven); such was his beauty that the bystanders were carried away with admiration, saying that it was beauty itself in its essence. 3.

In love truly conjugial there is nothing whatever of lasciviousness 4. Those who do not know what love truly conjugial is, and who are not in it, may think that it is not given without lasciviousness, but yet the difference is such as is between heaven and hell; for their delight appears in externals as if the same, but every external derives its quality and its essential nature from internals. The internal of conjugial love is from the Lord, and thence from heaven, and from everything auspicious and happy there; but the internal of lasciviousness or of adultery is from the devil, thus from hell and from everything inauspicious and unhappy. Every external derives its essence from internals; therefore neither are the external of conjugial love and the external of adultery alike. The external of conjugial love is filled with all the delights of heaven, and the enjoyment of heaven which is in that love expels all the enjoyment of hell; hence those two enjoyments in external form are, because of their internals, altogether dissimilar. The angels also clearly perceive from the sphere of the love of two consorts whether what is lascivious is in it, and its quality and quantity, and so far remove themselves from them. The reason that the angels so far remove themselves is, that the lasciviousness of adultery communicates with the hells, but the chastity of marriage with heaven. Love truly conjugial is chastity itself 5. Celibacy is not called chastity in the heavens, nor is a girl called chaste, neither is an unmarried woman, nor a virgin, but a wife who turns away from adultery is called chaste; likewise a husband who turns away from it, because love truly conjugial is what is called in heaven chastity. Conjugial love is innocence itself 6. Consorts who are in conjugial love appear in heaven like the innocent."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 836 Conjugial love is love to the Lord 7. All who are in love truly conjugial are in love to the Lord, because it descends from the marriage of the Lord with the church; hence it is that they who are in the third heaven, who are all in love to the Lord, are in love truly conjugial. Love truly conjugial cannot be given except by the Lord. Two consorts in heaven make one angel 8. There is between two consorts in heaven a similar conjunction as there is in every man between the will and the understanding, or between the good which is of the will and the truth which is of the understanding; because the female by nature is affection, which is of the will, and the male is by nature thought, which is of the understanding; more concerning these in the work on Heaven and Hell. Those who have for an end in marriages lasciviousness such as is of adultery 9. There appeared to me as if in a kitchen, wherein was a dark fireplace, without fire on the hearth, [women] with knives in their hands with which they, as it were, wished to slay infants; they were crafty, cunning, and malicious, all harlots, secretly alluring men to themselves from every quarter. These being inspected by the angels, appeared like intestines in pairs of balls, one of which was filthily bloody, the other foully yellow; thus were represented their lusts when they were inspected by angels. All were such women as seek matrimony solely for the sake of adultery with others, because then they do not fear scandal on account of illegitimate offspring, which they attribute to the husband; their lot is most cruel; all things there are filthy; they dwell in caves, and on account of their ugliness and deformity they fear to be seen, nor can they longer allure any adulterer because they are deformed and have a foul smell; men, also, with whom adulteries are the end of matrimony, and afterward have lived with adulteresses, acquire such a nausea"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 837 for a wife that they fly from them.

Lascivious wives, and also unmarried women who make light of whoredoms, dwell in two kinds of places, some in the western region in front, and some behind. All that are there knew how to insinuate themselves with men by simulated affections, by which they acquired the lascivious love of some male, caring nothing whether they were good affections or whether evil affections. Those who dwell in front were crafty and cunning, and of such a genius that they could perceive of what nature, disposition, inclination, and cupidity were the men whom they wished to allure, especially in depriving a man of his wealth, and in the meantime that they may live luxuriously. They dwell there in caves wherein all things are fetid, and the places where they dwell smell like the smell where mice are; they even appear when seen by angels like great mice. I have heard certain ones, who had been in their caves, saying that the smell was that of mice, and that their places were fetid and filthy; but that they knew how, by fantasies, to render themselves beautiful, and also to decorate these places with various articles, but this only for some moments; for when the fantasies cease the appearances cease, and then all things are foul. It is said even that they delight in those foul and filthy things, the more so the more interiorly they are in them. That they are thus delighted is from correspondences with such a life. They were often seen by me, sometimes when by fantasies they had assumed beauty, appearing then magnificent in dress and charming in countenance, but as soon a fantastic thought was removed from them, which is done by a good spirit and by an angel, they appear deformed altogether like devils, some black, some horribly flamy, some like corpses, and also they were often seen by me like great mice with long tails.

I saw that in those caves are noble wives, yea, of such men as were of the first nobility; but all there are compelled to labor, but no one of them can go out, nor is it permitted to let them out, because they are cunning beyond the rest of spirits, and enter the affections of men secretly and draw away their minds; in this they are more skillful than the rest, and so they are shut up, that at last they do not open a finger to let them out. 11. They, however, who dwell below in the western region are similar and in greater number. They are unmarried females who have given themselves to whoredom and passed their whole life in whoredom; there is a similar smell of mice there, not so strong, and they also appear like mice, but smaller. The caverns where they are appear winding and subterranean, one cavern below another, and a great multitude is there. 12. I have seen the larger mice, when a preacher came to them, hold by fantasy a book of psalms in their hand, and look towards certain from whom they draw what to answer, and answer as from themselves; this by cunning, and then they feign devotion, when yet they have no devotion at all; so they deceive the preachers, but they do this in the gates; but within in the caverns they answer nothing, because they cannot look to those from whom they draw the answers. Various things concerning marriage and adulteries 13. (1) Heaven is marriage and adultery is hell. 14. (2) Marriage descends from the marriage of good and truth, and adultery from the marriage of evil and falsity. 15. (3) Therefore there is given priestly adultery which in external appearance is similar."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 839 16. (4) In heaven they abhor adulteries, and therefore heaven is closed to adulterers; and hell is opened wide according to the quality and quantity of the adultery. 17. (5) A man by conjugial love receives the form of love in the mind, and therefrom in the body, thus the form of heaven. 18. And a man by adulteries receives the form of adultery, thus the form of hell. 19. (6) Conjugial love is the fundamental love of all heavenly loves, and it is the image of heaven, thus of the Lord. 20. (7) Heavenly joy is founded upon conjugial love. 21. (8) Hence the heavenly joys which the angels have solely from thence are innumerable; and scarcely one of those innumerable joys is known in the world, because at this day adultery reigns there even from falsity of doctrine, but that they were known in part to the ancients. 22. (9) Angelic wisdom grows by marriages, and it is in the place of procreation to them; for which reason it is a procreation of wisdom, whence daughters, sons, father, and mother in the Word signify such things as are of good and truth, thus which are of wisdom; passages may be adduced from the Word. 23. (10) From adulteries all ignorance and stupidity in spiritual things grow, because it is the marriage of falsity and evil. That falsification and adulteration of the truth and good of the Word is signified by whoredoms there, may be proved from the Word. 24. (11) To love the consort is to do good before the Lord, because this is chastity itself; and the church itself is called virgin and daughter, as the daughter and the virgin of Zion and Jerusalem. Passages may be quoted."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 840 25. (12) Conjugial love has communication with heaven, and the organs of generation have correspondence with the third heaven; especially the womb, concerning which correspondence. 26. Sexual intercourse from conjugial love also communicates. 27. (13) That love arises from the Lord’s influx alone through the third heaven. 28. (13a) The third heaven is the conjugial of heaven; thus marriages are held as most holy in heaven, and adulteries profane. 29. (14) What adulteries are, considered. 30. (15) Conjugial love increases in potency and effect to eternity, insomuch that it is love as to all power and effect, thence is the life of their souls; but with adulteries love decreases as to power and effect, even so that it becomes impotence and a stock, and scarce of any life. 31. (16) No one can be in conjugial love unless he be spiritual by combat against evils and their falsities, and unless he acknowledges the Lord and his Divine. 32. (17) The wife and husband are consociated as to mind as one flesh. It is my bone and my flesh, as Adam said. 33. (18) Conjugial love continually unites, that they be (one man). 34. (19) Conjugial love depends on the love of the wife, and such is the love of the husband in reciprocation, and the love of the wife does not depend on the love of the husband; the reason is, because like as the will actuates the understanding, good actuates truth, hence it is that it is said that the husband ought to cleave to the"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 841 wife; the contrary is the case with those who are not in conjugial love. 35. (20) The wife wills to think and will as the husband, and the husband as the wife, and because each wills this, each is led by the Lord as one, and the two are one angel; for when the will and the understanding are not one’s own, but the other’s, and this mutually and reciprocally, it cannot be otherwise than that they be led by the Lord as one. 36. (21) Hereditary evil becomes by adulteries continually more malignant, which is on account of adulteries which are considered allowable. 37. (22) Adulteries are most filthy may appear only from this, that the seed of the man as to its spiritual, and also as to its interior natural, adds itself to the body of the woman, for the man’s life is in it; what, then, can it be, when the lives of several men are introduced at the same time, but filthiness and interior putridity. 38. (23) An example that one acquires such a nausea and disgust against his wife, as not to be able to look at her, merely when he doubted about God and the Word; he was a priest . . . 39. (24) Conjugial love is such love, such delight, and such wisdom to those, that heaven is in it; that so far they are men, is confirmed by angels of heaven by a living voice. Afterwards they looked into hell, and said that there was all filthiness, and that especially adulterers and adulteresses appear like swine and hogs, and those who are like swine and hogs delight in ordure; and they said that one of them delighted in it so much that he wished to eat it. This coincides with the prophet who was ordered to make for himself a cake with dung. 40. (25) By conjugial love the interiors of the mind are opened, because the influx into it is from the Lord through the third"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 842 heaven; thence a man becomes receptive of all celestial loves and likewise of truths. 41. (26) In conjugial love is the inmost of conscience. Conjugial love with the angels 42. I have spoken concerning conjugial love with angels, and they said that it is the inmost of all loves, and that it is such that a consort sees his consort in his soul and in his mind, so that his spiritual image is there; and thus that a consort has the consort as if in himself, and this is cohabitation in the spiritual sense. This also was represented by angelic ideas which cannot be expressed. Hence their conjunctions are delicious. To one man one wife 43. In the Christian world, where interior things of the church are revealed, and where the Lord is worshiped, and it is known that from him is heaven and the church, and the church is conjoined with him, as a wife with a husband, and that there is but one church, and that with those who are of that church there will be the conjunction of good and truth, it is not allowed to take several wives, for this would be to pervert the spiritual which is or can be in marriage. Wherefore, if a Christian man should take several wives, it would be as if he had with himself two churches; also as if truth should take its essence from two goods, with which marriage is not given; for good is the esse of truth, and the esse or essence of one truth from two goods is not given. Whence it is that love truly conjugial can by no means be given in the case of one man with several wives, for thus it would be lasciviousness that would enter; besides, love cannot be divided, since it is from the affection of one, which is of the will, concordant with the thought of another, which is of the understanding, and this unanimity and cohabitation, which makes the essence of conjugial love, cannot be given (in the case of several wives). In a word, with them there is not the Christian Church, wherefore when an angel in heaven only thinks"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 843 of several wives, the celestial and angelic perishes, and joy as well as wisdom with him, and he falls from heaven. 44. There have been seen those from Christians who have confirmed themselves about polygamy, they were several thousands in one society; for those who are alike as to love form a society, and conjugial love is the fundamental of all, and when the last judgment took place, that region appeared as if swallowed up by hell, and afterwards it was said that they knew nothing about their members of generation, just as if they had been without them; they had confirmed themselves in this from the Judaism of the Old Testament, because it was then lawful to take several wives; but it is lawful in Mohammedanism everywhere. It was permitted to the Jews because the Jews were external men, inwardly idolaters, with whom the interiors of the church were not, nor were opened; wherefore they did not recognize the Lord. What it is with Mohammedans shall be told hereafter. 45. In a word, several consorts and one husband cannot become one flesh, that is, one mind, which consists of will and understanding, the marriage of which, as far as relates to the mind in its existence, presents a marriage; for all things in the universe relate to the marriage of good and truth; thus to marriage, in order that they may be anything, and produce anything, and marriage itself in its very form and its very essence, is presented in man with his compeer; likewise in an angel. A plurality of wives among Mohammedans 46. I have spoken with Mohammedans about the spiritual marriage, that it is the marriage of good and truth, and that good loves truth, like two consorts, and that they desire to be conjoined, and to produce goods and truths, like daughters and sons, and to procreate families as it were. This they understood well, and also that conjugial love descends from that spiritual origin, and that all the spiritual with man undergoes a change, so that it may scarcely be recognized when it descends into the natural, but is known only by correspondences. From which it appears that those who have"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 844 several wives conceded to them from their religion, cannot have love truly conjugial. And it is said that a plurality of wives was conceded to them, or polygamy was permitted, because those who are in warm countries, more than those who are in cold countries, burn with libidinous heat; therefore if polygamy had not been permitted them, many of them would rush into adulteries more than Europeans, and would thus act contrary to their religious persuasion, and to act contrary to that is to profane what is holy. It was shown further that all their love of marriage is lascivious, thus not spiritual, and cannot become spiritual unless they acknowledge the Lord. 47. The lot of those in the other life is such, that first, as in the world they there take several wives besides concubines [pellices]; but because in the spiritual world the conjunction is of souls, and they are of different souls, they cannot be together, but separate from each other spontaneously, and are finally conjoined to a woman who is of similar soul; thus gradually they separate from their women, and thus finally are united with one with whom their soul accords; moreover, they who persist in polygamy, in the course of time become so feeble and impotent that they are disgusted with marriage, for lasciviousness brings this with itself. 48. Those of them who are in their heaven have but one wife, and have rejected more, for there is a Mohammedan heaven distinct from the Christian heaven; but they who at last, as do many, acknowledge the Lord as one with the Father, are separated into heavens, which communicate with the Christian heavens, and with them there is conjugial love. 49. They have heard from the angels conjugial love described as to its delights and pleasantnesses, and that it endures to eternity with an infinite variety of delights and pleasantnesses, and they wondered; many of them therefore received faith in the Lord, and were sent among the angels of the Christian heavens, and instructed concerning the Lord and in the doctrine of love and faith towards him."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 845 The state of consorts after death 50. Almost everyone who has lived in marriage in the world, after death either meets with his wife, if she died first, or awaits her. When they meet, they mutually explore each other as to what their mutual affection was; and if there had not been mutual affection, they separate spontaneously, for two dissimilar affections and thoughts cannot consociate, for there is a communication of all affections and thence of thoughts; if there is not a concordance, a great uneasiness begins, then difficult breathing, like a discordant panting, so that they cannot but be separated, and then they are conjoined with others according to similitude. 51. They who have lived in celibacy, live also in celibacy for a long time; but, if they have desired marriage in the world, they also at length enter into marriage. 52. Those who cannot await the other consort, whether male or female, are conjoined in the meanwhile to another similar one; but then there is given them a perception that it is the same consort they had in the world, but this is dissolved, because there were no betrothing and nuptials, when the true consort arrives, for then from cohabitation in the world they know each other well, and they who wish remain with their own, as was said before. 53. The marriages of the angels of heaven are all provided by the Lord, who alone knows the similitude of souls which is to endure to eternity; and then a consort from the first glance recognizes his consort, which is because the similitude of souls conjoins. 54. But in hell there are not marriages, but there are adulteries; in infernal societies there the men are separated from the women, and when they think that they are to speak with a wife, from a habit acquired in the world, he goes to the women and a persuasion is given him then that this or that one is his woman, with whom he then consociates himself; but that persuasion is varied, because it makes no difference, since in hell there is no marriage but adultery."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 846 Those who live modestly and chastely in outward form, but think lasciviously 55. Afar off were seen women concerning whom it was said that they had lived in the world as virgins, and had avoided matrimony for the sake of chastity, saying that matrimonies were in themselves unchaste, comparing them to allowed whoredoms; it was said also that many of them were from convents, professing chastity for the sake of heaven or eternal salvation. They appeared from afar as naked, because chastity and innocence is represented in the spiritual world by nakedness, which also signifies a life blameless and free from whoredom; but it was perceived that from afar off, in a secret place, they dealt, after death, with men, adulterers, taking care sagaciously not to be seen; but when they were manifestly caught, then they escaped with mocking and fled away. Then was felt the ardor of the men who desired them for wives, because they thought them more chaste and innocent than others. It was said that they were more obscene than others, having delighted in heinous lasciviousness; they were such women as had thought lasciviously within themselves. 56. It was said of them that after a space of time they acquire such an aversion for matrimony that nothing can exceed it, and conjugial love perishes, and they become disgusting, and this after they have been for some time foul prostitutes, having cast aside all shame, because the external being removed, the internal acts, and their internal without the external is then without any bond from shame. 57. Those who have affected external sanctity, and also have been given to devotion, and thus are religious, because they become profane and have mingled adulteries with the delight of sanctity, whence comes profanation, appear at length like bony skeletons. To dominate in marriages takes away conjugial love, and concerning the Dutch women 58. Concerning the love of dominating in marriages, that it takes away all love truly conjugial, since conjugial love is such that the"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 847 one wills to think and will as the other, and thus mutually and reciprocally, so neither one dominates, but the Lord; thence is the delight of conjugial love. 59. That wives may not dominate their husbands is taken care of there in societies; there the men dwell on one side and the women or wives on the other, and when the men desire they send to them and summon them, and then they are separated, or live separately; if the wives are indignant and become angry on account of it, and attack the men because of serving and obeying when they are called; then they are sent forth from the society and wander over various places, and a desire is given to them of going away and deserting the husband; then when they wander, everywhere they encounter an inclosure or obstacle, as it were a marsh, water, or a wall, and so forth; and while this lasts the desire of going away diminishes, and they do this until they are tired out, and then they return to the society and to the mansion there where they had been before; thus the Dutch women are amended. The torment of those who are of hell, from the influx of conjugial love 60. All influx from heaven torments the infernals, wherefore hell is removed from heaven and is also everywhere shut up, so that influx may not at all be felt; the reason is, that they are in contrary love, and just as infernal love torments the celestials, so celestial love torments the infernals; but the celestial prevails, wherefore hell is removed as far as possible; this is meant in the Evangelist, in Abraham’s saying that there is a gulf, so that there is no passing over. 61. But the influx of conjugial love from heaven especially torments the infernals; I have seen spirits in hell brought even into the world of spirits, which is the middle, when these perceive the influx of conjugial love, they come into fury so as to act like furies and also as if they were tormented like serpents in tamarisks [myrica], twisting hither and thither their bodies and intestines like one who is twisted miserably by torment within; they compared"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 848 their suffering with the greatest sufferings; the reason is that the love of marriage and the love of adultery are altogether opposite, and conjugial love itself is heaven, and the love of adultery is hell. The love flows into their externals and torments their internals. The infernal marriage 62. The infernal marriage is when one wills to command and the other wills not to serve; thence is deadly hatred interiorly. This was represented by the most direful things, which on account of direfulness cannot be described. They breathe nothing else than slaughter, and also torment of each other; wherefore they are separated and live separated in hell and adultery, concerning which above, concerning Charles XII. Those who plot against conjugial love 63. I have heard from such, many plots and secret arts of alluring chaste wives to adultery. I have seen more arts than in the world, gaining the favor of them as well as of the husband, by flattering both, and especially the husband; putting on the appearance of interior friendship, exploring the desires and cupidities of the wife, whether she wishes openly or unwillingly, besides a thousand other things. But such are sent not long after death into a hell, situated under the hinder part of the province of the knee, and are there very deep and altogether shut up, that there may be no aperture whatever to look out of that prison, for they are dangerous against conjugial love, which is most holy, and there they are compelled to labor, and have a harlot in place of a wife. 64. But they who have the rage of violation, and perceive a delight in violation, are let down into a cadaverous hell whence exhales a smell as from corpses, which excites vomiting; it excites it with me."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 849 65. They plot by means of love towards infants; they were seen to rise from the earth over in front of Gehenna, almost invisible, continually removing obstacles, so that they might come into chaste homes; these they love, but not unchaste ones. They can put on various countenances, and also by arts send themselves forth through thoughts as if they were elsewhere, and thus enter. They put on also a countenance of innocence, and preach chastity; they extol it with praises; they enter into friendships in various ways, even so that they are praised and loved, and if the wife is conscious and desirous, she is praised. They spoke with me, saying, that they wondered that there could be any so conscientious as to say that this is against conscience, charity, and religion; they were in such persuasion, that they saw no evil in it, much less anything filthy. They also spoke sanely concerning marriage; their hell also is under the buttocks, in front, in the foul excrementitious smell there; and because they are crafty, feigning chastity, innocence, and friendships, and many other things, therefore when they come to their internals, which are adulteries, they are vastated until they appear deformed devils; as to internals little of the human remains. They become stupid because they are against the holiness of heaven. They mock and laugh at those who call marriages holy, and adulteries profane or even unlawful. Love truly conjugial is naked 66. The angels of the third heaven are those who are in celestial marriage more than others, for they are in love to the Lord, and thence in the marriage of good and truth; whence also they are in conjugial love more than other angels, and in innocence and chastity. These walk with a cincture around the loins when abroad, and without the cincture when at home; and yet in their nakedness, they look upon the consort as a consort, nor is there anything lascivious therein. They say that to look at a consort clothed detracts from the idea of marriage, and what is wonderful, nakedness does not excite or stimulate; it is, however, as an internal bond of conjugial love. In bed they lie conjoined as they were created, and sleep so."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 850 They say that they cannot do otherwise, because conjugial love itself, which is perpetual, conjoins; thus also the life of the one is communicated with the life of the other, and the life of the husband becomes appropriated to the wife; that it may be as we read of Adam when he saw Eve his wife: “Behold my bone and my flesh,” and also that “they were naked and not ashamed,” that is not lascivious; but as soon as Adam through his wife receded from love to the Lord, which is meant by “the tree of life” in Paradise (of which there, and Rev. 2:7), which happened because they acted from themselves and their own proprium, namely, from the science and delight of the natural man, then the marriage of good and truth perished, then nakedness became lascivious, and the chastity of marriage failing, they were ashamed of nakedness, and were clothed with fig leaves, and afterwards with woolen garments; thence by nakedness in the Word is meant lasciviousness, like that of adultery. 67. In the other heavens under the third, all appear clothed, and also blush at nakedness before the eyes of others, because it excites lasciviousness; to them marriage is not such a delight as in the third heaven; in the lowest heaven there is also something of cold but not indeed as in the world. 68. I was carried by the Lord through changes of state towards the left to a certain mountain, where all were naked, wives and husbands, at a distance I spoke with them, and they said that all are naked there, and nevertheless no lascivious appetite or desire was caused to anyone from seeing nakedness, and that each consort loved the consort tenderly; also that they could not be united with them clothed; they told the reason, that all were chaste in mind, because they were such in the world. When any newcomer of such a nature arrives from the world, they explore him, which is done by his putting off his garments and stripping himself; then they perceive immediately whether he has a genuine conjugial; if not, he is driven away with punishment; they drive him with blows until he appears no more, and this to the depth. There was a certain one who thought he was in like"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 851 conjugial love, because in the world he had lived chastely with his wife, nor had he ever had anything in common with harlots; he at first could look upon naked women without any emotion of mind, but when his sight had been fixed for some time he was deprived of his senses at the sight, and finally at the touch of nakedness, and stood without speech as if half dead, wherefore, he was driven away; the reason was that he was not in love to the Lord nor in the marriage of good and truth. They said that few could approach, because the sphere of conjugial love is such, that others cannot bear it; they said that they live in houses with men servants and maid servants who are all in marriage. 69. The angels of the third heaven dwell upon mountains, not rocky but of earth, upon which are paradises and gardens with trees; the mountains appear elevated to a point; in the highest part of the mountains are the best and most chaste; below, according to degree in marriage, are the spiritual and the spiritual natural; also their distinctions are according to the quarters, the eastern quarter where they are in love, the south where they are in wisdom. Conjugial love descends from the marriage of good and truth 70. From much experience it has become known to me that no one has conjugial love unless he be in the love of truth from good, and in the love of good through truth, that is, in celestial marriage; and that no one can be in any mutual love of good and truth except they who shun adultery and are averse to it as infernal; and this although they may have lived in marriage in the world, and loved their consort on account of cohabitation and the delight of earthly life, and for the sake of children. For celestial things ought to flow into conjugial love, and man after death comes into his celestial or spiritual things, and then becomes such altogether as he was with regard to them, nor can it be otherwise. Conjugial love causes a man to be love 71. Man was created to be love and thence wisdom, since the Lord is Divine love and Divine wisdom, and it is from creation that a man is the image and likeness of the Lord (Gen. 1:26, 27). And"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 852 this cannot be without genuine conjugial love. From that everything of man can be turned into love, for in marriage it is lawful for each to love even the body from the heart, and thus to dispose the soul and all things thence to the form of love, which otherwise is not possible. The inmost and outermost there make one, and induce that form, and that form is a form of heaven. The exploration of spirits by conjugial love 72. Spirits who have recently come into the spiritual world are explored, first of all, as to whether they are against conjugial love; they are led to places where the sphere of conjugial love passes by, or to chaste consorts; if then they change countenance and indignation appears, and more, if they then think lasciviously, and still more if they speak so, it is a sign that they are of infernal mind; but if they then rejoice and are exhilarated, that they are of a celestial mind; it is a test whether they are of heaven or of hell; those who are against conjugial love are of hell; they who are with it are of heaven. Adulteries from faith separated from charity 73. I was with those who had confirmed themselves in faith separated from charity, not only in doctrine but also in life, believing that they were to be saved by faith alone even in the hour of death, howsoever they had lived; and thus that all evils were either not regarded by God the Father, or excused on account of the infirmity of man, or remitted, and that when remitted, they were also washed away; they looking to the merit of the Lord from the fulfillment of the law, and that by the passion of the cross he had taken away the sins of the world, and the condemnation of the law, and various things which their doctrine teaches. I perceived when they were in the company of those, or among those with whom they communicated, when we were speaking of that faith, there existed the most obscene representations of heinous adultery, such as that of a son with a mother. The sphere itself was"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 853 such that it could be perceived by spiritual communication. They act into the occiput, and thus enter into the thought. From their presence also comes pain in the left knee. 74. The reason that such adultery is perceived from them is that they think of God, of the Lord, of salvation, and of eternal life, and they confirm those things from the Word, which thence are spiritual, and because there can be nothing of faith unless it be conjoined with some love, and with them this is conjoined with love merely natural and with its cupidities, and the conjunction of faith with evil love makes that adultery. They think concerning faith from an evil life, and when they are in the delights of terrestrial and corporeal love, thence is the conjunction of faith or truth with evil. The spiritual which is of faith is as a mother, and the son is evil. 75. I have seen cohorts of them cast out into the hells, and many of them into deserts, where everything of faith is taken away from them, and there they live like wild beasts, and when everything of faith is taken away from them, they are almost deprived of rationality. Why in the Christian world, more than elsewhere, adulteries are not abhorred 76. The gentiles wonder why in the Christian world adulteries and whoredoms are accounted allowable by many and even by most, when yet their religion from the Word of both testaments condemns them to hell; but the reason was told, that few live according to their religion, but have embraced the doctrine that faith saves; that is, that thinking and not living [saves]; and because thus truth is conjoined with evil, thence from the influx from hell adulteries are loved and received, and also they excuse them. For the influx of hell prevails with them over the influx of heaven. The sphere of adultery also closes heaven, and when heaven is closed, hell is opened; hence its origin comes from the falsity of religions. It is otherwise with those who place religion in life and doctrine at the same time."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 854 The sphere of adultery 77. When they speak against the truths and goods of faith and charity, a sphere of whoredom and adultery is produced, and then adulterers rush thither as crows to a carcass, and delight in that stench; thence the sphere is filled with such and other obscene things, that a good person would be horrified. Adulterers and their hells 78. Their hells are under the buttocks, which are excrementitious; they desire to emerge thence and come into the world, but in vain, because they had loved terrestrial and corporeal things. Thence appeared, as it were, a vomiting and heaving, in such an effort are they. Adulteries in the Christian world 79. There are many there of family and of illustrious condition, and thus not of the common people, because they adopted the principle that marriages are for the sake of offspring, and it matters not whether they are violated by others; and they laugh at the sanctity of marriage, calling them silly. Such were brought up out of the hells in great numbers, and being let into the state in which they were in the world, they inquired where there were beautiful wives, and when it was pointed out, they rushed like insane persons and like furies, wishing to enter into houses; but in their blind heat they were carried away to a place where the earth opened, and the crowd was cast into a hell which was behind the back. The influx of adultery from genii 80. I have passed through the hell where were crafty and interiorly vastated adulterers, and then it was permitted them to flow into the affections of my will, and with such subtlety and art and skill to invert, pervert, and extinguish my thoughts in favor of chastity, and to induce the enjoyment and lust of adultery. They"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 855 turned themselves to every particle of thought from affection, persuading silently; this was done with me, that I might know that man of himself could in no way resist the delight of adultery except from the Lord; for they act into the hereditary life within the thought, insomuch that man can in no wise observe it; but there was then given me by the Lord an interior perception of their effort. Priestly whoredom 81. This is especially committed by those who have confirmed the falsities of doctrine from the Word, and thus have falsified and adulterated it; the reason is that the Word is marriage, corresponds to marriage, and in itself is spiritual; and the delight of natural love falsifies it, especially in preachers. 82. They who read the Word without doctrine cannot but fall into many fallacies from the sense of the letter which is according to appearances with man, and at the same time they have acquired many falsities and confirmed themselves in them, and at the same time are thence in the pride of their own intelligence; these produce adulteries as of a father with a daughter-in-law. 83. They who confirm themselves that all evils are remitted by the holy supper, without other repentance and without conversion of life, and who do evils, and are in the belief that afterwards evil or sins are taken away by the holy supper, their adultery is with the maternal aunt. 84. Because the Jewish nation had by traditions falsified all things of the Word, it is called by the Lord an adulterous nation. 85. When charity is acknowledged and not faith, and yet the life of charity is not lived, and they still read the Word, it is the adultery of sister and brother. There are those who frequent the temple, and then pray devoutly and care nothing for evils of life, as"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 856 thefts, secret robberies, adulteries, hatreds, revenges, cursings of enemies and those who do not favor them. This is with a sister. 86. The love of self, especially of ruling and yet thinking from the Word, is such as that of Sodom, wherefore they demanded the angels from the house of Lot. 87. Those who speak much concerning God, and yet care nothing about deceiving men and depriving them of their goods, commit adultery with maid servants, whom they change frequently. The hells of adulterers 88. There are many hells of these, according to the kinds of adultery, which are various. 89. I have seen harlots who hid themselves in the western region and obstructed the roads, that none might approach except they were willing; I was taken thither; and they were harlots who were all cast into a marshy pool, remote at the back, in the west; they were such as were openly harlots. 90. Those who had exercised whoredom secretly, without the knowledge of others, and were such to the end of life, were cast into a dark cavern in the west. 91. Some harlots of noble family who excelled in genius, and also could reason about God, are cast into a marshy pool in the southern region. 92. Other harlots who were able to steal men by arts not known in the world, compelling them into their proprium by praises and by the immersion of their mind into themselves, and because then being without protection from the Lord, they were delivered over to them, such women are cast into a place burning as it were with sulphur and fire, according to appearance. They dwell in the"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 857 southwestern quarter, and similar men are cast into a dark abyss sloping under the pool of the women. Women fascinate men, and men women, by diabolical arts, which are many and which it is not allowed to recount. 93. Those who are adulterers spiritually are distinguished from adulterers naturally; the latter, if they perceive delight in adulteries, and no delight in marriages, are excluded from heaven, and are all sent into hells; but the adulterers spiritually, although they perceive nothing unlawful in adulteries, are yet explored and even amended, and others are allotted places according to life. 94. There are some in excrementitious hells who are addicted to variety, and by it have extinguished the conjugial; and at the same time are voluptuous; they are in the province of the intestines, under the former, where are everywhere sinks and a foul odor; and everywhere there are caverns from which such an odor exhales. 95. Those who had a communion of wives are bound as it were into a bundle, and the bundle is tied together by a stretched-out serpent and they are cast into a whirlpool which is beyond the spiritual world of this earth. 96. They who seduced by the appearance of piety, and thence persuade themselves that adulteries are not contrary to the Christian life, are sent into Gehenna, whence is perceived a stench as of burnt bones and hair, and are there in the fantasy that they are bitten by serpents; when in heat they are on fire, and when they approach heaven they become frozen like ice, and are miserably tortured. 97. Monks and Jesuits who have acted thus under the pretext of piety, and on account of pity towards them, with the promise that they would remit sins, are also committed to Gehenna."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 858 The correspondence of the members dedicated to generation in both sexes 98. Those societies which correspond to the genitals are distinct from others, because that region in the body is also distinct. 99. Those who love infants, and educate them in heaven, constitute the province of the genital members, especially of the testicles and the neck of the womb, and live the most sweet and happy life. 100. There are societies of the third heaven, which especially correspond to those members, because they have conjugial love. 101. In general it is to be held that the loins, and the members appertaining thereto, correspond to genuine conjugial love, consequently to those societies where there is such love; the angels there are more celestial than others, and more than others live in a state of innocence and peace, and in its delights which are inmost. 102. There appeared to me trees planted in a nursery, one of which was taller, the other lower, and two small ones. The lower tree delighted me greatly; and at the same time the most pleasant quiet, which I cannot express, affected my mind. The angelic spirits interpreted this sight, saying, that conjugial love was represented, the quiet and peace of which were also felt in the mind. By the higher tree was signified the husband, by the lower one the wife, and by the two small ones children. They added that in such pleasantness of peace were those who belong to the province of the loins. 103. There appeared to me a great dog, such as he who is called Cerberus among the most ancient writers; he had terrible jaws. It was said that such a dog signifies a guard, that man may not pass from celestial conjugial love to the infernal love of adultery. When there is a passing from that love to this opposite one, the delight"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 859 appearing almost similar, then there is set such a keeper, as it were, that opposite delights may not communicate. 104. The inmost heaven through which the Lord insinuates conjugial love, consists of those there who are in greater peace than others. Peace in the heavens is comparatively like spring in the world, which delights and vivifies all things; it is celestial delight itself in its essence. The angels who are there are the wisest of all, and from innocence appear to the others like infants; they love infants even more than their fathers and mothers have loved them. They also preside over those who are with young. 105. There are celestial societies with which each and all the members and organs dedicated to generation in either sex correspond. Those societies are distinguished from others, just as that province in man is altogether distinct from the rest. Those who have loved infants most tenderly, as such mothers, are in the province of the womb and the surrounding organs, namely, in the neck of the womb and the ovaries; and those who are there are in a most sweet and tranquil life, and in celestial joy more than others. 106. But what and of what quality those societies are which belong to each organ of generation, is not given to know, for they are interior. They refer also to the uses of those organs which are hidden and also removed from knowledge; for the reason, which is providential, that such things which are in themselves most celestial may not be injured by filthy thoughts, which are of lasciviousness, whoredom, and adultery; which thoughts are excited with many when those organs are only named. From Arcana Coelestia [n. 5055]. 107. It is enough to know that love truly conjugial has immediate communication with the third heaven, and also that love itself with its celestial delight is there preserved in all its variety, and also its acts, such as kisses, embraces, and many other things which delight that heaven, for that heaven is in the communication of good affections, when the spiritual heaven is in"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 860 the communication of the thoughts of truth; hence it is evident that filthy affections and thoughts altogether close both heavens. 108. A triturating vessel was seen by me, and by it stood a man with an iron instrument, who from his fantasy seemed to himself to triturate men in the vessel, torturing them in direful ways; the man did this with great delight. The delight itself was communicated, that I might know what and how great was the highest infernal delight with those who were such. It was told me that such a delight reigned with the posterity of Jacob, and that they perceived nothing more delightful than to treat the Gentiles cruelly, to expose them when killed to the wild beasts and birds to be devoured, to cut them while living with saws and axes, to cast them into a brick furnace (2 Samuel 12:31), to dash to pieces and cast forth infants. Such things were never commanded nor ever permitted, excepting to those the sinew of whose thigh was out of joint, as Jacob’s when he wrestled with the angel (Gen. 32:26, 32, 33). Such dwell under the right heel, where are adulterers who are also cruel. Among the adulterers who are both cruel and the most unmerciful, are many of the Jesuits and monks who were adulterers; their delight is similar when they behold the punishment of death, especially on those who derogate from their despotic power over the church and heaven, and over the souls of men, and also who infringe on their privileges. 109. Those who have lived in things contrary to conjugial love, namely, in adulteries, when they approached me, infused a pain into the loins, severe according to the life of adulteries which they had led, from which it appears that the loins correspond to conjugial love; their hell also is under the hinder parts of the loins, under the buttocks, where they live in filthy and excrementitious things; these also are delightful to them, for such things in the spiritual world correspond to their pleasures. 110. Those who are in things contrary to conjugial love, strike pain also into the testicles; they are those who lay an ambush by love, friendship, and good offices, concerning which the following: There arose from the region of Gehenna, as it were, a certain inconspicuous air; it was a band of such spirits, but it appeared"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 861 then to me as one only, although they were many; against whom were interposed, as it were, bundles, which nevertheless they seemed to themselves to remove, by which was signified that they desire to remove obstacles, for in such manner do the thoughts and efforts of the mind appear representatively in the world of spirits, and when they appear, it is immediately perceived there what they signify; afterwards it seemed as if there proceeded from that body someone small and snow white, who came to me, by which was signified their thought and intention, that they wished to put on the state of innocence, that no one should suspect anything of their quality; when he came to me he let himself down towards the loins and seemed to bend himself, as it were, around both of them, by which it was represented that they were in chaste conjugial love; then around the feet by spiral turns, by which was signified insinuation by such things as are in their nature delightful; finally that little one became almost invisible, by which was signified that he wished to be altogether hidden; it was told me that such was the insinuation of those who plotted against conjugial love: namely, who in the world had insinuated themselves for the end of committing adultery with wives, talking chastely and sanely concerning conjugial love, caressing infants, praising the husband in every manner of speech, so that they might be thought friendly and innocent, when yet they were cunning adulterers; it was shown me what such become, for after these things were done, that little snow white person who represented the band arising from Gehenna was made conspicuous, and appeared dusky and very black, and very much deformed besides, and was cast forth into a deep hell under the middle part of the loins, where they live in excrements. I afterwards spoke with similar ones, and they wondered that anyone should have conscience about adulteries, and on account of conscience should not lie with the wife of another when it was allowed; and when I spoke with them about conscience, they denied that anyone had conscience. It was told me that such were mostly from the Christian world, and rarely any from other parts. Marriages 111. What genuine conjugial love is, and whence is its origin, few at this day know, because few are in it; nearly all believe that it"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 862 is inborn, and thus flows from a certain instinct, as they say, and the more so because the conjugial exists also with animals; when yet there is such a difference between conjugial love with men and the conjugial with beasts as there is between the state of a man and the state of a brute animal. 112. Conjugial love takes its origin from the marriage of the Lord with heaven and with the church, and thence from the marriage of good and truth. That conjugial love draws its inmost essence from thence, does not appear to the sense and comprehension, but yet can be proved from influx and from correspondence, and besides from the Word; from influx, because heaven is from the union of good and truth which inflows from the Lord, and is compared to marriage and called marriage; from correspondence, because when good united with truth flows down into a lower sphere, it presents there a union of minds, and when into one still lower, it presents a marriage; wherefore the union of minds from good united to truth from the Lord is conjugial love itself. 113. That genuine conjugial love is from thence may also be proved from this, that no one can be in it unless he be in good through truth, and in truth from good from the Lord, also from this, that celestial blessedness and happiness are in that love, and all they who are in it come into heaven or into celestial marriage; also from this, that when there is speech with the angels concerning the union of good and truth, there is presented in the lower region among good spirits a representative of marriage, and among the evil spirits is presented a representative of adultery; hence it is that the adulteration of good and the falsification of truth is called adultery and whoredom. 114. The men of the most ancient church more than others on this earth lived in genuine conjugial love; they are those who were described by the ancients as those who lived in the golden age where innocence, love, and justice reigned. In that love there was heaven to them, but later, after the knowledge of the Lord, and thence love towards him, perished, conjugial love perished, love"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 863 towards children remaining; but children can be loved by the evil, but a consort cannot be loved except by the good. 115. I have heard from the most ancient people that conjugial love is such, that each one wishes to be altogether the other’s, and this reciprocally, thus mutually and interchangeably, and then that the conjunction of two minds is such, that this mutual and interchangeable is in all and everything of the thought. 116. I have spoken with the angels concerning this mutual and reciprocal, and it was described that the image of one is in the mind of the other, and that thus they cohabit, not only in the single things but also in the inmosts of life; and that the Divine love of the Lord can flow into such a one with what is happy and blessed. They said also that they who have lived in such conjugial love in the world, are together, and cohabit in heaven as angels, also together with their children; but that very few are from Christendom at the present day, but all from the most ancient church which was celestial, and many from the ancient church which was spiritual. 117. It was told me that the kinds of celestial and spiritual happinesses, that is, only their universals, are indefinite in number and ineffable, and scarcely any one of them is known in the Christian world, because they are not in the marriage of good and truth, nor in love to the Lord; they know not whence is good, and thus what is truth, and they know not that the Lord alone is the God of the universe. 118. With those who live in conjugial love, the interiors of the mind are open through heaven, even to the Lord, for that love inflows from the Lord through the inmost of man; they thence have the kingdom of the Lord in themselves, and thence genuine love towards infants, which is for the sake of the Lord’s kingdom, and thence they are more receptive of celestial loves than others, and are in mutual love more than all, for this comes thence as a stream from its fountain; for from the marriage of good and truth"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 864 descend and are derived all loves, which are like the love of parents towards children, the love of brothers between themselves, and love towards relatives, thus according to degrees in their order, which loves are only from the marriage of good and truth; from this marriage are formed all celestial societies, according to all their consanguinities and affinities, and at the same time in each society, whence heaven is called a marriage. 119. Genuine conjugial love is not possible except between pairs, that is, in the marriage of one man with one wife, but not with many; because conjugial love is mutual and reciprocal, and the life of one interchangeably in that of the other, so that they are as one. Such a union is given between pairs, but not between many, for many destroy that love. The men of the most ancient church, who were celestial and in the perception of the union of good and truth like angels, had one wife only; they said that they perceived with one wife celestial delights and happinesses, and when marriage with several was only named, they were horrified. That the marriage of one wife and husband descends from the marriage of good and truth is evident from the words of the Lord in Matthew 19:3–12, which may be seen and adduced; also from the words of Adam concerning his wife. By “Adam and his wife” there is signified in the internal representative sense the most ancient church, which was the golden age, the age of Saturn, concerning which the ancient authors wrote. 120. I have perceived the contrary with adulterers, that they are nauseated at marriage and all things which are of marriage, so that they see a wife but do not speak with her from any life; they are averse to all things of it which consorts formerly loved with delights. But as soon as they see the beautiful wife of another as the wife of another, they burn with cupidity; a fiery life kindles the countenance and eyes, and they take delight in everything of her which the husband is averse to, and thus he does when he sees other women. 121. There was a certain spirit in middle altitude, who in the life of the body had lived lasciviously, being delighted with variety, so"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 865 that he had loved no one woman constantly, but in brothels, and thus had committed whoredom with many and afterwards rejected each one, whence it happened that he had extinguished the desire for marriage, and had contracted an unnatural nature; all these things were disclosed, and when he attempted a like thing in the spiritual world he was miserably punished, and this in sight of the angels, and then cast into a hell, which is such that they appear there like scum such as is on the surface of the sea; they are the mucus of the nostrils and almost without life, because they have lost everything human, because everything of heaven, which is founded upon conjugial love. 122. That they cannot be in heaven is evident, for they are as it were contrary to the love of marriage, thus they are contrary to the affections of good and truth from which heaven originates; for when marriage is mentioned there, filthy ideas immediately come in from influx into the contrary. In their ideas are obscene, yea heinous things. They are also in the purpose of destroying heavenly societies. Their religion is to say that they acknowledge the Creator of the universe, Providence only universal, and salvation from faith alone, and that it cannot be worse with them than with others; but when they are explored as to what they are in heart, which is done in the other life, they do not believe those things at all, but in nature instead of the Creator of the universe; and instead of a universal Providence, in none at all; religion they believe to be for a restraint on the common people to make them live morally. With those who by adulteries have acquired a disgust and nausea for marriages, when anything pleasant, blessed, and happy flows down from heaven, it is turned into what is nauseous and loathsome, then into what is painful, and finally into what is noisome; with others into what is obscene. 123. They desire to obsess man, and with man to return into the world; but they are shut up that they may not speak with man. 124. The conjugial is represented everywhere in the kingdoms of nature, as from the transformation of worms into nymphs and chrysalises, and thus into winged insects; for when the time of their"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 866 marriages arrives, which is when they put off earthly forms, which is their worm form, they are distinguished with wings and become flying insects; then they are elevated into the atmosphere as into a certain heaven of theirs, and there they sport among themselves, transact marriages, lay their eggs on leaves, and are nourished with the juice of flowers. They are then also in their beauty, for they have wings of golden, silvery, blue, and shining white colors, and some beautifully distinguished and variegated. Such things does the conjugial produce with such lowly small animals. 125. There are those who have the cupidity of deflowering young virgins, or to whom virginities and thefts of virginities are the greatest pleasures, without the end of marriage, and when they have stolen the flower of virginity, they afterwards desert them. Those who have led such a life, because it is contrary to their spiritual and celestial nature, and because they destroy the conjugial, are interior murderers, who undergo the most grievous punishment in the other life, for they regard this only from the flower of virginity, which being bereft, they love them no longer, and because it is contrary to innocence, which they wound and kill by leading into a life of harlotry innocent women who otherwise would be chaste, who might be imbued with conjugial love, and thus are destroyers of marriages. It is known that it is the first flower of love which initiates virgins into chaste conjugial love and conjoins the souls of consorts, and because the sanctity of heaven is founded upon conjugial love, thus upon innocence. They are led into fantasies, the actions in which appear as it were real and sensible, and they seem to themselves to sit upon a furious horse which throws them upwards, so that they are thrown down from the horse as if with risk of life, such a terror is struck into them; afterwards they appear to themselves to be under the belly of a furious horse, and shortly it seems to them as if they went through the posteriors of a horse into his belly, and then it appears to them as if they were in the belly of a filthy harlot, which harlot is changed into a great dragon, and there they remain wrapped up in torments; this punishment returns as often as they are in that cupidity, and approach young virgins with their craft. Others are punished by disjointings and unjointings, or by contortions and retortions, from which"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"MARRIAGE (DE CONJUGIO) 867 punishments they are so torn to pieces that they seem to themselves as if cut into bits or fragments with cruel pain, and if then they do not desist, they are cast into a hell of foul-smelling odor. 126. Those who in the life of the body think lasciviously, and whatsoever others speak convert it into lasciviousness, even holy things, do not cease to think and speak thus in the other life; and there, because their thoughts are communicated, those things come out into obscene representations, whence are scandals. Their punishment is to be stretched out horizontally in the presence of the spirits whom they have injured and whirled around like a roller from left to right rapidly, and then in a reverse direction in another position, and then in another, and so naked in the presence of all or half naked according to the quality of their lasciviousness, and at the same time they are struck with shame. Then they are whirled around by the head and feet transversely like a wheel; resistance is caused, and at the same time pain, and again resistance and at the same time pain, for two forces act, one around, the other back, and so with the drawing apart pain is caused.

A cause of coldness is, whoredom before marriage with the wives of others; also meretricious love and concubinage after marriage; in general, all libidinousness by which the conjugial perishes (n. 918–928). A cause of coldness between consorts is, that conjugial love is believed to be one with scortatory love (n. 958–961 [ Conjugial Love, n. 247]). Whoredom is the genuine cause of divorce (n. 985–993 [ Conjugial Love, n. 255]). Adulterers do not acknowledge God (Memorabilia, n. 1300 [ Conjugial Love, n. 500]).

Heinous adulteries within the prohibited degrees correspond to certain heresies confirmed by the Word (n. 1405–1407 [ Conjugial Love, n. 519]). The internal and spiritual cause of conjugial love is to shun adulteries from religion (n. 1602–1606 [ Conjugial Love, n. 147–149]). An external or natural cause of love and friendship between consorts, is abstinence from whoredom from any cause, excepting impotence only (n. 1611–1614).

There are several kinds of adulteries; there are those that are mild, those that are grievous, and those that are most grievous (n. 1876 [ Conjugial Love, n. 479, 487, 491, 493]). Simple adultery is that of an unmarried man with the wife of another, or of an unmarried woman with another’s husband (n. 1877–1879 [ Conjugial Love, n. 480]). It can be seen from reason that adultery is unjust (various things, n. 1778 [ Conjugial Love, n. 481]).

Triplicate adultery is with blood relations (n. 1884, 1885 [ Conjugial Love, n. 484]). There are adulteries of will, and there are adulteries of deed; and adulteries of the will in themselves are like those that are actual when opportunity offers and various fears do not prevent (n. 1886, 1887 [ Conjugial Love, n. 490]).

Their effect is, that man does not acknowledge God, the divinity of the Lord, the holiness of the Word, and consequently the other things that belong to the church and to religion (n. 1897–1903 [ Conjugial Love, n. 497]).

Scortatory love is opposite to celestial love, because scortatory love is infernal, and conjugial love is heavenly (n. 1911–1914 [ Conjugial Love, n. 429]). Scortatory love is in the enjoyment of evil and falsity, but conjugial love in the enjoyment of good and truth (n. 1915–1919 [ Conjugial Love, n. 427]).

Differences between beasts and men (n. 1194, 1197, 1198 [ Conjugial Love, n. 48, 94–96, 133, 134]). Man acts from the will and from its freedom, and from the understanding and according to its reason; but the beast acts not from a will, thus not from freedom, neither from an understanding, thus not according to its reason; but from connate loves, through knowledges that promote them (n. 1196–1199 [ Conjugial Love, n. 133, 134]). Because man has will and understanding, he knows the order according to which he ought to live; he knows this from the Divine laws which are those of the church, from the civil laws which are those of society, and from the laws of reason; but the beasts know not any order from those laws, but are carried along by knowledges that are born to their loves, and of which they are wholly ignorant, to do what they do (n. 1200–1211 [ Conjugial Love, n. 133, 134]). The influx into men and into beasts (n. 1200 [ Conjugial Love, n. 94, 137]). Man is born with the faculty to become rational and spiritual, and the beast is born with no faculty for these things (n. 1212–1218 [ Conjugial Love, n. 96, 151–153]). From these three considerations it follows, that in all which a man thinks, speaks, wills, and does, there is the rational and the spiritual, in their own way; but that in all that a beast expresses by sound or by act, there is not the rational nor the spiritual in any way (n. 1219–1221 [ Conjugial Love, n. 94, 133, 134]). In the love of the sex with men there consequently is the rational and the spiritual, and thence imputation; but in the love of the sex with beasts there are not those (n. 1220–1235)."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"INDEXES TO “MISSING TREATISE” ON MARRIAGE 889 In everything that man does, there is imputation; but there is no imputation in anything done by a beast (n. 1222–1227 [ Conjugial Love, n. 96]). Therefore if the love of the sex with men were as it is with beasts, man would not from this be as a beast, but viler than a beast (n. 1234, 1235). There are many other distinctions between the love of the sex with men and with beasts; but they can be seen by those only who are familiar with the differences between man and beast (n. 1236–1238). Man is not born into the knowledge that pertains to love of the sex, but the beast is born into it all; but this knowledge is knowledge to man, but to the beast it is not knowledge (n. 1239–1242 [ Conjugial Love, n. 133, 134]).

The correspondence of spiritual prolification is with the love of producing, and in the state of creation of conserving the truths and goods of the church (n. 1361, 1362 [ Conjugial Love, n. 115, 127]). The correspondence of parental love is with the love of innocence and of protecting it from evils and falsities (n. 1363 [ Conjugial Love, n. 127, 395 at end]). There is the correspondence of these conjugial things in marriages of one man with one wife, thus with those who are in the marriage of good and truth from the Lord (n. 1364). With those who are polygamists from religion, the correspondence of these conjugial things is a remote correspondence; but with polygamists in Christendom the correspondence is with the falsities and evils of hell (n. 1365, 1366). The correspondence of these conjugial things with those who have confirmed falsities of faith, is with the evils and falsities of hell (n. 1367, 1368). So, too, with those who are in evils of life (n. 1389–1393). With those who are in diverse religions, there is not correspondence with goods and truths (n. 1394, 1395). The correspondence of good and truth cannot be given with those who are in the love of self and in the pride of their own intelligence (n. 1396–1398).

There is a correspondence of spiritual marriage, or that of truth and good, with the actual marriage of men, that is, of husband and wife (n. 1952–1954 [ Conjugial Love, 520]). Violation of spiritual marriage therefore corresponds to violation of the marriages of men (n. 1955–1958 [ Conjugial Love, n. 515–520]). Hence it follows that to violate the truths of the Word and the church by falsifying them, is to commit whoredom spiritually; and that to violate the goods of the Word and the church by perverting them, is to commit adultery spiritually (n. 1959–1962 [ Conjugial Love, n. 518]). They, therefore, who are in spiritual whoredom and adultery are also in actual natural whoredom and adultery; the converse also is true (n. 1963–1969 [ Conjugial Love, n. 520]). Spiritual marriage is violated when the truth of the church is separated from its good, and when its good is separated from its truth (n. 1970–1976 [ Conjugial Love, n. 519]). Spiritual marriage is violated when appearances of truth, in the Word, are taken for genuine truths and are confirmed (n. 1977–1979). Spiritual marriage is violated by those who with the lips make profession of another church than that which they acknowledge in heart; and it is very greatly violated by those who in heart acknowledge no church (n. 1980–1989). Spiritual marriage is violated by those who learn the truths of doctrine from the Word but live wickedly; also by those who are devout in worship but do not reflect at all on their lives (n. 1983–1987)."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"INDEXES TO “MISSING TREATISE” ON MARRIAGE 909 Spiritual marriage is violated by those who study the sense of the letter alone, without doctrine (n. 1988–1991). The marriage of good and truth is violated when the Word is read for various ends, and not at the same time read for the sake of the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1992–1994). There are as many genera and species of spiritual whoredoms as there are of natural, for so many are the correspondences (n. 1995–1997). From these things also it may be seen that marriages are heavenly, and that adulteries are infernal (n. 1998–2000). Defloration. (See Virginity.) Degrees. There are three degrees of life, and the three degrees of life are in every man (n. 149–153). There are three degrees of love and wisdom (n. 154–158). There are three degrees of substances and forms (n. 154–158). These three degrees can be opened with man; and they are opened as man receives truths in the understanding and does them in will (n. 159–162). Differences between those with whom the natural degree has been opened, and those with whom the spiritual degree, and the celestial degree, has been opened (n. 202–207). The marriage of good and truth descends from the Lord through three degrees, and in each degree it goes on from greatest to least; hence there is infinite variety in that marriage (n. 373–375). Marriages of the highest degree, which are called celestial, are infinitely more perfect than marriages of the lower degree which"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"INDEXES TO “MISSING TREATISE” ON MARRIAGE 910 are called spiritual, and these are infinitely more perfect than marriages of the lowest degree which are called natural (n. 376–378). Marriages of the lowest degree are perfect in the measure of the reception of the influx of the conjugial sphere from the two higher degrees (n. 379–381). These marriages without the reception of influx from the two prior, do not draw their origin from the marriages of good and truth, but from the connubial relations of evil and falsity, which are adulteries (n. 382–385). Adulteries also are of three degrees (n. 386–388). Degrees, and influx according to degrees (n. 433, 434). Man is a form of the three degrees; celestial, spiritual, and natural (n. 699). Substance, because it is form, is a subject (n. 700–708). Delights. (See the other index also.) The delights of conjugial love (n. 77–146 [ Conjugial Love, n. 183; compare n. 69, 144, 155, 198, 293, 294, 443]). All things of joy and of gladness are meant by delights (enumerated, n. 77). Love through wisdom makes them to be felt (n. 77 [ Conjugial Love, n. 8 end, 461]). All delights are from love and its effect (n. 78 [ Conjugial Love, n. 8 end]). The delights of love are all in the effect, and by this they are in the means (n. 78 [ Conjugial Love, n. 8 end]).

The highest and inmost delights, which are of peace and innocence, are imperceptible; but they become perceptible as they descend; and at length in ultimates they become a delight that is sensible to the highest degree (n. 106–109 [ Conjugial Love, n. 69, 183]). The first reason why delights become in the highest measure perceptible in ultimates, is, that they descend in order from those which are imperceptible, and in ultimates all are together (n. 110–120 [ Conjugial Love, n. 68, 69]). The second reason is, that conjugial love affects the most minute particulars of both mind and body (n. 120–123 [ Conjugial Love, n. 68, 69]). The third reason is, that there is communication of that love and its delights with the heavens (n. 124–128 [ Conjugial Love, n. 144]). The fourth reason is, that those delights are according to use, and the use of conjugial love is the most excellent of all (n. 128–131 [ Conjugial Love, n. 183]). The fifth reason is, that they have conjugial love who are in conjunction with the Lord (n. 131–136). Hence the delights of this love are ineffable and beyond number (n. 136–140).

The love of the sex grows and strengthens itself earlier and more strongly with one than with another (n. 1800 [ Conjugial Love, n. 450]). The love of the sex, with those in whom it strengthens itself earlier and to a greater degree than with others, cannot be totally suppressed without harm (n. 1801, 1802 [ Conjugial Love, n. 450]).

(See Sphere.) The sphere of the love of infants is the sphere of protecting and supporting those who are unable to protect and support themselves (n. 1658–1662 [ Conjugial Love, n. 391]). The sphere of the love of infants inflows into all living and animate things in the universe, and fills them with the love of innocence and peace, which love is received by them in their own way (n. 1663–1666 [ Conjugial Love, n. 388, 394]); And it induces upon them a new and wonderful state; one that is full of the love of supporting and protecting their own offspring (n. 1667, 1668 [ Conjugial Love, n. 392]). Everyone living and animate receives this state into himself or herself after a birth; nor is there knowledge that it inflows, because the influx is not felt (n. 1669 [ Conjugial Love, n. 391, 392]). The sphere of this love affects the female sex more than the male; thus mothers more than fathers (n. 1670, 1671 [ Conjugial Love, n. 393]). It affects fathers and mothers variously, each according to the state of the mind (n. 1672–1674 [ Conjugial Love, n. 405, 408]).

The state of innocence and peace with infants is, that they know nothing and can do nothing from themselves, but from others, especially from the father and mother; and this state successively recedes as they know and become able to act from themselves, and not from others (n. 1685–1689 [ Conjugial Love, n. 399]).

With consorts who love each other, conjugial love is conjoined with parental love through spiritual and rational causes, and natural causes from these, which are with them from the Lord (n. 1707–1709 [ Conjugial Love, n. 404]). In the case of such consorts, there is parental love through the husband with the wife, and on the other hand there is parental love with the husband from the Lord through the wife; in consequence, the love of the one is also conjoined mutually and in its turn with the love of the other (n. 1710, 1711). With consorts who do not love each other, although there is not conjunction of those two loves from what is higher, interior, or"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"INDEXES TO “MISSING TREATISE” ON MARRIAGE 939 prior, still there is a conjunction from what is lower, exterior, or posterior; but such conjunction is inverted, and consequently is light and wandering (n. 1712, 1713 [ Conjugial Love, n. 408]).

There is natural conjugial potency from the love of the sex, which when not limited to the wife is lewdness; and the potency of this is lasciviousness (n. 1566). Spiritual conjugial potency is from conjugial love, with one wife; when this potency becomes conjugial it is chastity, and its potency is without lasciviousness (n. 1567). Natural conjugial potency successively decreases, as its love, which is lewdness, is not limited (n. 1568–1573). But spiritual conjugial love successively increases, as its love, which is heavenly, is purified from lascivious love of the sex (n. 1574). Natural conjugial potency decreases even till it becomes naught; but that which is spiritual increases even till it becomes constant (n. 1574–1577). Natural conjugial potency successively extinguishes the interior fire of man’s life, and dims its light; but that which is spiritual successively kindles the fire of man’s life and exalts its light (n. 1579).

The quality of the merely natural man 1. Once, from the desire of knowing the quality of the mind of the merely natural man, I looked up into heaven, and besought this knowledge from the Lord. The reason was that I had heard a most distinguished natural man, saying that he could see, understand, and perceive many things just as rationally as they who are called spiritual, and thence angels of heaven; and he added to what he had said, “Has not each one a like rationality? What makes the difference except a frivolous opinion?” Suddenly then a certain satan ascended from the hells. Satans are all merely natural and can ratiocinate skillfully, but from the fallacies of the senses; wherefore they see falsities as truths; for all falsities derive their origin from those fallacies. When he came in sight he appeared at first with a bright and living face, afterwards with a face deathly pale, finally with an infernal black face. I asked why his face underwent those changes. I received answer from heaven, that such are the successive states of the minds [mens] of those who are merely natural, for faces are types of minds [animus]. The inmost of their minds [mens], because they are infernal, are represented by blackness in the face; the intermediates of their minds by the pallor of death, because they have falsified truths; but the outmosts, by a living whiteness, because while they are in externals, which is while they are in company, they can think, confirm, understand, and teach truths. They have this ability, because rationality is human nature itself, for by it man is man, and is distinguished from beasts. But the rationality with satans is in externals alone; they have none, however, in internals; because in internals reigns the cupidity of adulterating the goods, and of falsifying the truths of the church; and this cupidity inflows into their rationality and overshadows its light, and covers it with thick darkness, so that they do not see anything but falsities in place of verities."},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 991 2. After I looked at his face, I looked into his eyes, and behold their pupils sparkled as from rays of light; afterwards they became opaque, and the irises became quite green, and finally, they appeared as if covered by a film, from which the whole crystalline lens in the pupil appeared like a cataract. Having seen these things I asked him whether he could see anything, and he said, “I see clearly and more than before.” And I asked, “How can you see when your eyes have amaurosis? Perhaps you see something from fatuous light within.” He responded, “What is fatuous light?” In order therefore that he might know what fatuous light is, I asked, “What do you think from your light?” He said, “I think in clear vision that beasts think just as rationally as man.” Afterwards he said that God is nature, and nature is God; and then also that religion is vanity; and further, that nothing is good or evil but that which is delightful or undelightful and other like things. 3. When these things had been said, I proffered some genuine truths, which, before while he was in externals, he had seen and confirmed; and immediately when he heard them, he turned his eyes inward, acknowledged, and turned his eyes back again, and with a kind of border of the film which covered the pupil, he absorbed those truths, and injected them into his own fatuous light, and then he called them falsities; but because this appeared offensive before my sight, and as it were deadly, since in such a manner he slaughtered truths, from which, nevertheless, a man is a man and an angel is an angel, I abominated his presence; wherefore I turned my face from him; and when I looked back, behold I saw him sinking through a kind of gulf into hell; and because the place where he had stood stank from him, I went hastily home; for the Divine truth falsified by satans, in the spiritual world, stinks like the filth of the streets. 2. The first state of man after death 4. When any man after death comes into the spiritual world, which for the most part takes place the third day after he has expired, he appears to himself in a life similar to that in which he had been in the world, and in a similar house, chamber, and bed"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 992 chamber, in a similar coat and clothing, and in a similar companionship within the house. If he was a king or a prince he appears in a similar palace, if a peasant in a similar cottage; rustic things surround the latter, splendid things the former. This happens to everyone after death, to the end that death may not appear as death, but as a continuation of life, and that the last of natural life may become the first of spiritual life, and that from this a man may progress to his goal, which will be either in heaven or in hell. 5. That such a similarity of all things appears to the recently deceased is because their mind remains the same as it was in the world; and, because the mind is not only in the head, but also in the whole body, therefore a man has a similar body; for the body is the organ of the mind, and is continued from the head; wherefore the mind is the man himself, but then no longer a material man, but a spiritual man; and, because he is the same man after death, there are given to him things similar to those which he had possessed at home in the world, according to the ideas of his mind; but this lasts only some days. That the mind is in the whole body, and is the very man who lives after death, appears manifestly from the speech of the mouth and the action of the body being instantaneous with the will and thought of the mind; for the mouth speaks in an instant what the mind thinks, and the body executes in an instant what the mind wills. The erroneous belief that man lives after death a soul or mind, and this not under the appearance of a man, but under the appearance of a breath, as it were, of respiration, or as a bubble as it were, of air, is because men do not know that the mind makes the interior form of the whole body. 6. When newcomers into the spiritual world are in this first state, angels come to them for the sake of wishing them an auspicious arrival, and at first they are greatly delighted from conversation with them, since they know that they do not think otherwise than that they still live in the former world; wherefore the angels ask them what they think of the life after death, to which the newcomers respond in conformity with their previous ideas; some"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 993 that they do not know; some that they are breaths or ethereal appearances; some that they are airy transparent bodies; some that they are flitting specters, some of them in ether and air, others in water, and others in the middle of the earth; and some say that they are souls like angels in the stars. Some of the newcomers deny that any man lives after death. 7. When they have heard these things the angels say, “Welcome, we will show something new, that you have not known, nor have you believed before, namely this, that every man lives a man after death, in a body altogether as he had lived before.” To these things the novitiate spirits reply, “This is not possible. Whence has he a body? Does it not lie with all things of it dead in the grave?” To these things the angels respond merrily, “We will demonstrate it to your sight.” And they say, “Are you not men in perfect form? Look at yourselves and touch yourselves; and yet you have departed from the natural world. That you have not known this before now is because the first state of life after death is altogether like the last state of life before death.” On hearing these things the new guests are astonished and exclaim from joy of heart, “Thanks be to God that we are alive, and that death has not extirpated us!” I have often heard novitiates instructed in this manner concerning their life after death, and have seen them gladdened on account of their resurrection. 3. The consummation of the age, the destruction of the world, and the end of the church 8. I have often heard the conversation of angels with new spirits, and once about the consummation of the age and the destruction of the world. And because those new spirits had hitherto known nothing of heaven and of hell nor of the life of man after death, nor of any other sense of the Word than the literal, they gave responses void of reason and full of paradoxes. They said that by the consummation of the age they understood the destruction of the world; by the coming of the Lord then, His appearing with the"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 994 angels in a cloud; by the last judgment, sentences decreeing salvation and damnation upon all the dead after their resurrection from the grave. When the angels had heard these things they asked with smiling countenance, two or three times, whether the spirits said these things from faith of heart which is believed to be the truth; or from historical faith, which in itself is tradition from others, or from the indulgence of the imagination. To these questions the new guests replied with indignation, “What have we said from the indulgence of the imagination, or from mere tradition? Are not these things truths revealed in the Word? They must be of faith of heart.” When these things were said, the angels courteously answered, “It does no harm for you to believe thus, but that it is not so, you shall hereafter be instructed.” 9. Immediately after this was said little flames appearing like tongues flowed down from heaven upon the heads of the newcomers, by which they were inspired with the affection of knowing from reason how they had faith; and they exclaimed, “What is faith but truth? Where is truth in its own light except in the understanding? If the understanding be in thick darkness, what then is faith but a somnambulist? And if to this faith be added confirmation from natural light separate from spiritual light, it becomes a bat.” Among the newcomers was a certain priest, who, when he heard these things from his associates, said with an inflamed voice, “What has faith to do with the understanding?” The angels replied, “What is faith without the understanding, but a blind faith?” Suddenly then the little flame fell down from the top of the priest’s head upon his shoe and shone there a little while. 10. After this the angels asked the novitiates what further they had thought from their faith, concerning the consummation of the age, and what they still thought. They replied, “We had thought of the destruction of the universe, both heaven and earth; since we read that heaven and earth should be destroyed, and it was said that they should pass away in smoke.” The angels then inquired, “What heaven and what earth; the heaven and earth of the natural world or of the spiritual world? There are also heavens and earths here, heavens where the angels are, and lands upon which they dwell.” At"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 995 this the novitiates responded, “What is this? Perhaps you are joking? Are not angels spirits? What is a spirit but a breath of wind? And where is this breath? Does it not fly about in the atmospheric heaven, and go even to the stars?” The angels then replied, “You are now in the spiritual world, and as yet you know no otherwise than that you are in the natural world. Here heaven, where the angels are, is above your head, and hell, where the devils and satans are, is under your feet. Is not the soil, upon which you and we stand, earth? Stamp it with your feet and know.” But at this, because it was foreign to previously conceived ideas, they wondered greatly; yet, because they were in enlightenment, from the little flames upon their heads, they listened willingly to the discourse of the angels, and comprehended the truths they uttered. 11. The angels asked further, “In what manner did you believe that the destruction of your world would take place?” They said, “By fire, about which we have believed and prophesied many things: some of us, that flames from heaven would be cast down everywhere upon the earth, as they were upon the sons of Aaron, and upon the burnt offering of Elijah; some, that the fire of the sun would be let loose, would break forth, and set the universe on fire; some, that the central fire of the earth would break the crust round about it, and hurl itself forth everywhere, as it does from the fire- vomiting mountains, Aetna, Vesuvius, and Hecla; some, that a great comet would invade the atmosphere of the earth, and would set it on fire with the flame of its tail; some have said that the universe would not perish by fire, but would go to ruin, and fall to pieces, as does a house from age; and others have believed otherwise.” When the angels had heard these things they said to one another, “O what simplicity! Arising only from utter ignorance of the spiritual world and of the angels, and of their heavens and earths, and also from utter ignorance of the internal or spiritual sense of the Word! Thence all things of eternal life have become mere things of the memory, and not of the reason; and if there be anything of reason, it is not above the memory but below it, where confirmations from fallacies counterfeit the light of reason. This was represented by what we lately saw, that the little flame fell down from the priest’s head upon his shoe, and shone there; and"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 996 this appears to us as if one were to take his hat from his head, and wrap it round the soles of his feet and thus walk.” 12. The angels then said, “We have been chosen from heaven to instruct newcomers from the countries of the natural world, since all who arrive here from there, are in a foolish belief about heaven, yea, even about salvation; wherefore unless those follies are dissipated, which is effected by instruction, their rational, which is above the memory, and grows wise from the reception of celestial light, would be closed, and this being closed, from being men they would become animals, with this sole difference, that they would still be able to think from the external senses, and speak from this thought alone. 13. “Since this office of instruction is enjoined upon us, we will teach you what is meant in the Word by the consummation of the age.” And they said, “The consummation of the church is meant, which consummation is also called desolation and devastation, and this is when there are no longer truths of faith and goods of charity in any essence of their own, and thus all the ways to heaven are obstructed.” They also said, “This consummation appears scarcely anywhere in the world, because those things which are of faith are not truths but falsities, and those things which are of charity are not goods but only deeds of their own love, which, when they go forth in the breath of the mouth, do not elevate themselves to heaven, but as soon as they rise up they are turned aside and fall down to the earth, just as does the water of a bath when cast upon the shoulders, or as rotten fruit falls from trees in the time of winter. 14. “In this consummation or end of the church, it will be proclaimed from all pulpits, and the people will vociferate in all sanctuaries, ‘Here is the dwelling place of God! Here is the temple of God! Here is the church of God! Here is salvation! Here is the light of the Gospel!’ And they do not at all know that they are in mere darkness, and that they dream the dream of the age. This is because they believe that falsities are truths, and truths falsities, as also that evils are goods, and goods evils. This night and this dream"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 997 the Lord predicted in Matthew (24:37–39), and in Luke (17:26 to the end). 15. “You shall be confirmed that the consummation of the age is the end of the church, not only from reason but also from sight. Know then that the end of the church will not be at all recognized on earth, though fully recognized in the heavens. Heaven and the church are like a single containing house. The church is the foundation and substructure, and heaven is its superstructure and roof; and the inhabitants are consociated like members of a family with domestics. When therefore the church, by evils and falsities slips from under, that house does not hold together except as to its walls, and within, communication with the angels of heaven is intercepted, and the stairway, by which there is ascent and descent, is taken away. Lest the house should then fall into utter ruin the Lord returns into the world and establishes a new church, and by it restores the house, and supports heaven. But this will appear more evidently before your sight, if we pray to the Lord, and go away from here and walk about.” 4. The sun of the spiritual world and the coming of the Lord in a cloud 16. While walking they first turned their faces to the east, where they saw the sun shining in its strength, and when they were under its direct rays, the novitiates asked the angels about that sun, whether it was the sun which they had seen in the former world, since its altitude above us and also its magnitude equals that; it grows red also and burns from fire in a similar manner, and also heat and light proceed from it in a like manner; and if it be the same sun are we not in nature? Whence is nature except from its own sun? But the angels said, “This sun is not the sun of the natural world, but the sun of the spiritual world. From this sun is our universe; from its light and heat angels live and spirits live; from its light both we and they have understanding and wisdom; from its heat both we and they have will and love. The essence of"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 998 this sun is pure love, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the God of heaven and earth, and is one with God the Father, is in the midst of it. 17. “The Divine love proximately proceeding from him, and encompassing him, appears as a sun; wherefore by the light and heat thence proceeding, he has omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence, from end to end of both worlds. But the sun from which nature came into existence is pure fire; in the light and heat of which there is nothing of wisdom and love, wherefore nothing of life, but still it serves life, that is, wisdom and love, for a swathing and garment, in order that the forms of those lives may endure, and that they may have as it were times and spaces; but yet they do not have times and spaces; but love and wisdom only affect those who are in times and spaces, which takes place according to reception, and reception is according to the affection of being wise, and according to a life conformable to wisdom.” When the novitiates heard these things, they exulted with joy, and said, “We perceive that our hearts exult with joy as never before.” “You have this,” replied the angels, “from the celestial and spiritual love and its delight which proceed from our sun.” 18. When these things had been said, suddenly there was driven below the sun a bright cloud, which did not dull, but transmitted the light; and in that bright cloud appeared angels as with trumpets, and round about them were altars and tables, upon which in heaps lay half-open books; and above the cloud the Lord appeared, speaking out of the sun with the angels. Then from the cloud there fell as it were dew, which, being scattered about, was condensed into manna, some of which the angels took up and gave to their companions, who ate it. After a quarter of an hour, there was seen from the cloud a rain, which the angels called the morning rain, which flowed down, and dissolved the manna into its original dew. This was collected into drops of a sweet taste. The manna was soon fully melted and flowed into the ground and penetrated it. And then from the dwellers under that ground were heard voices of gladness, “Hey! Come forth! Be ready! Drops of the blessed water"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 999 are falling from Heaven! We are sprinkled!” For it was the melted manna which was dropping down. 19. After this the angels instructed the new guests about what they had heard and seen, saying, “The things, which you have seen, exhibit in a summary the Coming of the Lord, and the things which will then happen. God, who appeared out of the sun above the cloud, was the Lord our Savior. The bright cloud under Him was the angelic heaven, where the Divine truth was in its own light. The speech of the Lord with the angels there, was inspiration. The trumpets seen in the hands and at the mouths of the angels, were not trumpets, but representations of their speech with one another from inspiration. The dew falling from the cloud upon the earth, and condensing into manna, represented the heavenly affections of the thoughts in their speech. The rain dissolving the manna, that heavenly food, into its original dew, which, absorbed by the earth, distilled through to the dwellers beneath, represented the influx of Divine truth from the Word with the men of the world who go forth and receive it in spirit and heart. The tables and the heaps of books upon them, were not tables nor books, but they were representations of the intentions of the mind, and thence of deeds, according to which the faithful and the unfaithful will be judged. That bright cloud, in which the angels were seen, represented the Divine truths of the Lord with them; for the spheres of thoughts from truths, and of affections from goods, proceeding from the angels, appear everywhere as clouds.” 20. At this the new spirits inquired, “Why do you say that those things that were seen represent, and do not say that they are?” The angels answered, “Because each and all things which appear to the sight in this world are correspondences and representations, which contain in themselves truths, and thence signify them. Thus spiritual things are here presented under forms similar to natural things. “The spiritual things which are proper to our world, as they here appear, are also described in the Word. For the Word was written by correspondences, in order that it may be at the same time for"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 1000 angels and for men. These things are first offered to your sight, and are seen, that you may know how the coming of the Lord is to be understood.” 5. The abomination of desolation 21. After this the angels prayed to the Lord. They then led the novitiates from the east to the south, and thence to the west, and they said, “Here you shall see the abomination of desolation predicted by the Lord through Daniel (Matt. 24:15).” They then showed them a black cloud extending from the boundary of the east to the end of the west, and pouring thick darkness into the south and into the north at the sides. At the sight of the cloud the novitiates became terrified, and they asked, “What is that great black cloud and thick darkness and whence is it?” The angels replied, “They are satanic spirits, who have collected themselves into crowds, and by magical arts, by abuses of correspondences, and by fantasies, have formed for themselves as it were heavens, by seizing the hills, and building upon them high places and towers, as was done in the valley of the land of Shinar (Gen. 11:1 seq.) in order that they may contrive for themselves ascents into the heavens where the angels are, for the purpose of thrusting them down; and because they are on high above this land they appear as though they were in the expanse of the sky, and the expanse appears as a cloud.” And the angels said, “Lift up your eyes and stretch your sight.” And behold they saw a multitude of spirits, and they heard heinous expressions from them, intermixed with the filthy things of lasciviousness, and sounds as of drunken revelers in brothels. And the angels said, “These are they who are meant by the dragon and his two beasts in Revelation (chap. 12 and 13). These are they who are meant by the harlot sitting upon many waters, and upon the scarlet beast (chap. 17). They are all from the Christian world.” 22. And the novitiates asked, “How can these things be called the abomination of desolation?” The angels replied, “They are all in"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"FIVE MEMORABLE RELATIONS 1001 falsities as to faith, and in evils as to life. The interiors of their minds are infernal, and the exteriors from feigned morality, are, as it were, heavenly; for they are sycophants and hypocrites, and because they are in the midst between the heavens where the angels are, and the earths where men are, no Divine truth from the Lord can pass through the heavens to the men of the earth, but it is first received by them, and being received is inverted and falsified, not otherwise than is the case with light falling upon an opaque cloud, and the heat of the sun falling into a swamp.” 23. Then suddenly the eyes of the novitiates were opened, and they saw flowing down from that cloud hail mixed with fire, and they saw upon the earth as a result of that rain something sticky, and in that sticky substance worms. And farther towards the north they saw descending from the cloud, as it were, bruchi 12 and locusts, which consumed the grass of the earth. And eagles appeared flying out of a desert, and also birds of the evening, which devoured the worms and licked up that sticky substance as though it were water. Amazed by these things, the novitiates besought the angels to tell what they signified. They said, “The abomination of desolation upon the earth. The hail signifies falsified truths; the fire mingled with it, evils of life; the sticky substance upon the earth, coherence; the worms, life from those things; the bruchi and locusts, the falsities of faith; the birds signify men of the earth who eat no other food flowing down from the spiritual world; and the eagles signify ratiocinations and confirmations. 24. “Know therefore, that by ‘the former heaven and the former earth’ which John saw had passed away (Rev. 21:1). nothing else is meant but those black expanses where the draconians and Babylonians have fixed their dwelling places and called them heavens. So long as those expanses remain, the communication of men with the angelic heavens, thus also in a measure with the Lord, is intercepted; and when that communication is intercepted, then every truth and good of the Word is falsified and adulterated.

One evil contains in itself innumerable lusts, interior and exterior, of which man knows nothing. All these are removed by the Lord, while man looks to the Lord, and shuns evil as of himself.

Evil appears to man as one, and nevertheless they are in all lusts, interior and exterior, thus in successive order, but they are in the evil in simultaneous order. This also must be illustrated. Man is not purified by shunning evils solely on account of civil and moral causes; because by this he is purified only as to externals, but not as to internals. Thus no one is purified by the faith of the present day, which promotes only civil, moral, and political works. 2.

That endeavor is the will, which is only restrained by external causes. 6. The internal man is not merely to understand, to think, and to know. But it is to will what he understands, thinks, and knows. Hence it can be seen what the internal man is when separated from the external, and what it is when not separated.

Otherwise the Word would be of no use. Otherwise there would be no religion. 9. All things inflow with man, so that man is only a recipient organ. He is an organ recipient of all things of heaven as to his mind, and recipient of the world as to his body. As the eye is a recipient of light, the ears recipients of sound, and the remaining things of the body, so the understanding is a recipient of the light of heaven or of wisdom, and the will is a recipient of the heat of heaven, thus of love. There is nothing in man but the faculty of receiving. It may be illustrated by the organs what the faculty is. Natural objects are felt in the organs of the body as if they were in them, and spiritual objects in like manner are felt as if in the mind, although they are not there. These are fallacies of sensation. 10. Fallacies arise from inverted ideas.

The state of man as to the understanding is changed, and it is changed according to the love of the will. A man in the world may think that he is in heaven on account of the understanding, when yet he is not. Therefore the truths and goods in his understanding are taken away, because they do not agree with the love of the will. 12. Absurdities about instantaneous faith, and thus instantaneous salvation. Likewise about immediate mercy, because this makes one with instantaneous faith. Although indeed man is reformed and regenerated successively even to the end of life, and then to eternity.

There is a putting off, and a revelation of the interiors of truth. Experiments, that when truth lies hidden within with a man, the sense of the letter is open in heaven, and on the other hand it is dissipated, and sometimes with a noise; and if the confirmation of the love of evil lies hidden within, there appear as it were sparks of fire, and an explosion. All things of the sense of the letter of the Word communicate with all things of the heavens. Thus the Word is the conjunction of heaven and the church. This cannot be comprehended without a knowledge of correspondences. 15. A false principle in spiritual things falsifies all things. Thus it falsifies all things of the Word. It falsifies while he is reading the Word even though man does not know it. Falsities still insinuate themselves in each thing of the Word, from the side or in the middle.

I read the Athanasian Creed before Calvin, and in it the following words: “The right faith is, that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God, is both God and man; God from the substance of the Father, begotten before the ages, and man from the substance of [the mother], born in the ages. . . . Who, although he be God and man, is yet not two but one Christ. One, not by conversion of the divinity into flesh, but by the assumption of humanity into God; one altogether; not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person. For as the rational soul and the flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ.” 2. (1) After I had read these words before Calvin, and, at the same time, before fifty priests and his followers, I asked Calvin whether he had receded from these teachings in the Creed, which yet is acknowledged and received by the whole Christian world. Calvin said that he saw he had fully receded. (2) I asked why he had done so. He answered, that he had paid no attention to those words, and that now when he did pay attention, he saw that he had receded from them and had written according to his own thought. (3) I asked what he thought now. He answered, that if the Creed is true, and if it is universally acknowledged as the true doctrine concerning the trinity, and concerning the divinity of Christ, he had clearly erred. (4) I asked whether he wished to acknowledge that the Divine and the human, or God and man, in Christ, is one person, as soul and flesh are one man, according to the words in"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"CONVERSATION WITH CALVIN 1022 the creed. He answered, that he wished to do so, but that he could not, because he had confirmed himself differently. (5) I asked whether he believed Christ to be one person or two. He answered, one, if hypostatic union makes one, but that he had believed that the Son of God was another, and was with the Father; and Jesus Christ was separated from him, because he was in heaven. (6) I asked whether there were thus two Christs. He answered, that there were, and that therein he had receded from the creed. (7) I asked about the hypostatic union, from whom it was. He answered, that it was from God the Father, and that this was the idea he had had. (8) I asked about the soul of Christ, what it was, whether it was not the Divine itself, since it is said in Luke, that it was from the Holy Spirit and the power of the most high. He answered that he had seen this in Luke, but that he had tacitly believed within himself that it was from Joseph. (9) I asked whether Christ as to his human is not the Son of God, as is openly said in Luke 1[:35], and also when he was baptized, Matt. [3:17]; moreover, also by John [John 1:34], and also when he was transfigured [Matt. 17:5; Mark 9:7; Luke 9:35], and in many passages elsewhere. He answered that when he had mentioned and thought of the Son of God, he had not meant Christ Jesus as to his human. When I said that he understood what is contrary to Scripture, he answered that he sees that it is so, but that he had not thought that it was contrary to Scripture. I wished him to renounce it, but he was conscious of his thought while in the world, and he said, that, on that account he could not. (10) At last he confessed that he had thought Christ was the son of Joseph, but that he had not dared to write this. 3. Priests, his followers, were present to the number of fifty, and they heard Calvin give these answers to the questions; and I asked them whether they did not see, that, as to the person of Christ, they had not fully receded from the Athanasian creed. They answered that they had often read that creed but had paid no attention to those words there; and they were surprised that they saw them now for the first time with attention. They confessed that Calvin had openly dissented; and also confessed that as often as they had named Christ or heard him named, they had not understood the Son of God but a pure man who was made Justice"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"CONVERSATION WITH CALVIN 1023 for the human race, and that when they had named God only, they had meant God the Father. 2 Concerning the trinity of persons from the Athanasian Creed read before Calvin 4.

(1) I asked Calvin whether, from these words, he had confessed or thought of three Gods, although with his lips he had said, and still says, there is one God. He answered that he had thought of three unanimous Gods. (2) I asked how he could reconcile and make his thought and speech to be one, when it is allowed to confess each person to be a God by himself. He answered that he could not. (3) I asked how three could be one; whether it was by unanimous consent, or in some other way. He answered that it was by influx. (4) I asked, how could one person continually think the same as another? Must not each one think something by himself? He answered that he had not thought of this before, and that now when he did think of it, he perceived that each Person must also think something by himself. (5) I asked how then were they one indivisible essence? Did not the essence thus become divided? He answered, that sometimes it becomes divided, but that they finally accommodate themselves. (6) I asked him whether the essence is divided when the Son, as mediator and intercessor, speaks to the Father. He answered, that it is then divided, but only at that moment. (7) I asked him whether there were not thus three creators of the universe. He answered that there"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"CONVERSATION WITH CALVIN 1024 were, but that one did the work of creation through the other, the Father through the Son, and the Son through the Holy Spirit. (8) I asked him what idea he had of the birth of the Lord from eternity. He answered that he had a vague idea. 3 Concerning the personality of Calvin; his quality 6. Afterwards I asked Calvin how he could ascend into heaven with an idea of three gods, and with an idea of the Lord as being two. He answered that he had been admitted into a certain inferior society of heaven, and that he had dwelt there among the hindermost, who are not much explored; but that, when he had been explored, he had descended, because he could not subsist there; and that he had then betaken himself to Luther in the world of spirits, with whom he had dwelt for a certain period, and this because Luther acknowledged the human of the Lord as Divine, and he did not seem to himself to be safe anywhere else. With regard to Calvin, the priests said that he was an upright man, but simple; and that he had written according to his own simple thought, not considering whether what he wrote was or was not in agreement with sacred Scripture, as he had not reflected whether it was in agreement with the Athanasian creed. 4 With priests of the reformed concerning justification 7. Afterwards I spoke with those priests on the article concerning justification by faith alone.

They answered, that works follow from faith. (5) They were asked how they follow from faith; thus, whether man shall do them, or whether we must believe that God does them through man. They answered that man must do them of his own strength, because they are civil works, and that God has no part in them. (6) They were asked whether these are the good works which follow faith. They answered that they are. (7) They were asked how they can follow faith, when there is nothing of God in them, but only what is of man, and when, therefore, there is no bond between faith and works. They answered that they follow faith because by the imputation of faith man’s sins are remitted, and then whatever a man does is good in the eyes of God, thus also these works. (8) They were asked whether it is necessary for anyone to repent, since, by faith, all sins are remitted. They answered that one can if he wishes to, but that it contributes nothing to eternal life, but only to secular life. (9) They were asked, how then do good works follow faith? They answered, like fruits from a good tree. (10) They were asked whether faith produces good works in a similar manner as a tree produces fruit. They answered that by fruits from a good tree they mean all the works that a man does after he has received faith, because in the eyes of God they are good. (11) They were asked whether good works cohere with faith as fruit with a tree. They answered that they are not like that. (12) They were asked whether there is thus any bond between good works and faith. They answered that there is none.

The Roman Catholics, before the Reformation, held entirely similar teachings respecting these four articles; similar respecting a trinity of persons in the divinity, similar respecting the origin of sin from Adam, similar respecting the imputation of the merit of Christ, and similar respecting justification by faith, with the sole difference, that this faith they conjoined with good works.

My opinion concerning the writings of Böhme and L. . . . I have never read either; I was forbidden to read writers on dogmatic and systematic theology, before heaven was opened to me; because unfounded opinions and inventions might thereby have easily insinuated themselves, which afterwards could only have been removed with difficulty; wherefore, when heaven was opened to me, I had first to learn the Hebrew language, as well as the correspondences according to which the whole Bible is composed, which led me to read the Word of God over many times; and as God’s Word is the source whence all theology must be derived, I was enabled thereby to receive instruction from the Lord, who is the Word. “2. Query: How soon a new church may be expected? Answer: The Lord is preparing at this time a new heaven of those who believe in him, acknowledge him as the true God of heaven and earth, and look to Him in their lives, which means to shun evil and  15.

I daily see spirits and angels, from ten to twenty thousand, descending and ascending, and being set in order. By degrees, as that heaven is being formed, the new church likewise begins and increases. The universities in Christendom are now first being instructed, whence will come new ministers; for the new heaven has no influence over the old [clergy] who deem themselves too learned in the doctrine of justification by faith alone. “3. About the promised treatise on infinity, omnipotence, and omnipresence. 16 Answer: There are many things on these subjects interspersed throughout Divine Providence (n. 46–54 and 157); also in Divine Love and Wisdom, (n. 4, 17, 19, 21, 44, 69, 72, 76, 106, 156, 318), and in Apocalypse Revealed (n. 961); these subjects will be further treated of in the arcana of Conjugial Love; for to write a separate treatise on these Divine attributes, without the assistance of something to support them, would cause too great an elevation of the thoughts; wherefore these subjects have been treated in a series with other things which fall within the understanding.” (Dated Stockholm, February, 1767.) 2 From the second letter of Emanuel Swedenborg to F. C. Oetinger 17 “1. Query: Is a sign required to show that I have been sent by the Lord to do what I am doing?

And what effect did the Lord’s miracles have upon the Jewish nation, by whom he was notwithstanding crucified? The same would be the case now, should the Lord appear in the clouds with the angels and trumpets; as described in (Luke 14:16, 29–31). The sign, given at this day, will be enlightenment, and thence an acknowledgment and a reception of the truths of the new church; with some also there will be an enlightenment which speaks [illustratio loquens], which is more than a sign. But some sign will perhaps still be given. “2. Query: Whether I have conversed with the apostles? Answer: I have conversed with Paul for an entire year, and also on the subject of what he wrote in his Epistle to the Romans (3:28). Three times I spoke with John, once with Moses, a hundred times with Luther, who confessed to me that, contrary to an admonition received from an angel, he accepted the doctrine of faith alone solely for the purpose of separating from the Papists. With the angels, however, I have now conversed for twenty-two years, and I am still conversing with them daily; these the Lord has associated with me. “There was no use in my mentioning this in my writings; for who would have believed it? And who would not have said, ‘Show me a sign that I may believe’? And this everyone would say who did not see it. “3. Query: Why from being a philosopher I have been chosen? Answer: The cause of this has been, that the spiritual things which are being revealed at the present day may be taught and understood naturally and rationally; for spiritual truths have a correspondence with natural truths, because in these they terminate, and upon these they rest. That there is a correspondence of all spiritual things with all things of man, as well as with all things of the earth, may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 87–102, and n. 103–115).

Everyone also is led by means of natural things to spiritual things; for man is born natural; by education he is made moral, and afterwards by regeneration from the Lord he becomes spiritual. The Lord has granted to me besides to love truths in a spiritual manner, i. e., to love them, not for the sake of honor, nor for the sake of gain, but for the sake of the truths themselves; for he who loves truths for the sake of the truth, sees them from the Lord, because the Lord is the way and the truth (John 14:6); but he who loves them for the sake of honor or gain, sees them from himself; and seeing from oneself is equivalent to seeing falsities. Falsities that have been confirmed close the church, wherefore truths rationally understood have to open it. How else can spiritual things which transcend the understanding, be understood, acknowledged, and received? The dogma which has been handed down by the Papists, and accepted by the Protestants, namely, that the understanding is to be held in bondage under obedience to faith, has a second time closed the church, and what else is to open it again, except an understanding enlightened by the Lord; but on this subject see Apocalypse Revealed (n. 914). “4.

Without the unfolding and opening out of the literal sense of the Word by its spiritual sense, how can anyone know intellectually what is signified by the things which the Lord predicted (in Matthew 24), and also in the Book of Revelation, and in like manner in Daniel, and in the Prophets, in many passages? Make the experiment yourself, if you be so disposed, and read those passages of the prophetic Word which treat sometimes of wild beasts and cattle, sometimes of pools and swamps, sometimes of forests and brakes, sometimes of valleys and mountains, sometimes of screech owls, of ochim, tziim, satyrs, etc., etc.; try whether you can perceive anything Divine therein, unless you believe it to lie concealed interiorly, on account of its being inspired by God, just as a precious stone lies concealed in its matrix, as was said above.

The seed, nevertheless, remains with man in his mind as in its soil, and in time produces its germ and fructifies it, provided man by the seeds of life which are the truths of faith and the goods of charity, is conjoined to the Lord, and consociated with the angels. The above rulers are further admonished to receive thoroughly this belief, that the Word in its bosom is spiritual, because Divine; and that unless they receive this belief, they may be seduced by satans, so that they even deny the sanctity of the Word; in which case the church with them is dissipated.

In the short treatise [Brief Exposition], which I have sent you, as well as in all my former writings, I do not mean a son of God born from eternity, but the Son of God conceived and born in the world, in whom is the Divine trinity. In the Apostles’ creed, which was the confession of faith of the Apostolic church, no other Son of God is mentioned, nor is any other meant in the Gospels (Luke 1:32, 35; Matt. 3:17; 17:5; John 20:31; 1 John 5:20, 21). The reason, however, why the Nicene Council afterwards adopted a Son of God from eternity, and added still another Divine person, was this, that it could not discover any other expedient for expelling the erroneous doctrine of Arius; and for this reason, especially, the present church insists that reason shall be bound, and placed under obedience to a blind faith. But, that this does not transcend man’s faculty of comprehension, and that he is able to see and thus to believe, may be seen in (n. 117), and afterwards in (n. 44).” 2 From the thirteenth letter of Emanuel Swedenborg to Dr. Beyer 20 “The small treatise entitled A Brief Exposition of the Doctrines of the New Church, I have sent only to Bishop Benzelstjerna, with  19.

For instance, they cannot understand that in Romans 3:28, and in Galatians 2:16, an imputative faith in the merit of Christ is not meant, but the faith of Jesus, which is a faith from Jesus in Jesus; and, likewise, that the works of the law of the Decalogue are not there meant, but the works of the Mosaic law, which were simply for the Jews; and further, that in Romans 4 is not meant the imputation of the faith of the present church. Nor are they willing to be enlightened in such texts of the Scriptures as concern God’s Son, that by the Son of God is not meant a Son of God from eternity, but the Son of God conceived in time from Jehovah God, and born of the Virgin Mary, according to the distinct words of Luke 1:32, 35; Matthew 3:17; John 20:31; 1 John 5:20, 21, and other places. This is likewise agreeable to the Apostles’ Creed, where no other Son of God is mentioned, whence it follows that the primitive church knew of no other. A Son of God from eternity was adopted in the Nicene and Athanasian Creeds, because they could find no other way by which to refute and expel the errors of Arius (compare the Apostles’ Creed). I therefore adhere to the Apostolic church. “To worship God the savior cannot be prohibited throughout Christendom, and still less among the Lutherans (see the Augsburg Confession, p. 19, and also the Apology, p. 226); nor can it be denied that in Christ man is God and God is man, with many other things which I mentioned in a former letter. The Formula Concordiae explains also a Divine trinity in those who are reborn by faith (p. 695, Apology, p. 130); how much more then is a Divine trinity in God the Savior, etc., etc. (Col. 2:9). All this however and much more will be demonstrated in a work which will be published two years hence. 21 Brief Exposition is a forerunner of it, and is to prepare the way for its reception.

In the printed minutes I cannot find that they have taken a single step in regard to the question itself, but that they have simply busied themselves in making attacks in abusive and unseemly language, when yet the real point of issue is this, whether it is allowable to approach immediately our redeemer and savior Jesus Christ, or whether we must go a circuitous way, namely, to God the Father, that he may impute to us the merit and righteousness of his son, and send the Holy Spirit. But that we may go to the other, which is the direct way, namely, to our savior Jesus Christ, is in accordance both with the Augsburg Confession, and the Formula Concordiae and also with our own prayers and hymns; and it entirely agrees with God’s Word. “In the Augsburg Confession are the following words: ‘For [the Scripture] sets before us Christ alone as the mediator, the  22.

With respect to some verses in the books of Moses, which possess the property and power of introducing man to communication with spirits or enabling him to speak with them; I do not know of any verses in Scripture which have this property more than others; I only know that the Word of God is everywhere written in such a style, that when man reads it with affection and attention, spirits and angels have a part in it, and adjoin themselves to him; for the Word of God is so written that it forms a bond of union between heaven and earth (see what is written on this subject in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 303 to 310).

The Lord Himself has been pleased to introduce me into converse and communication with spirits and angels for the reasons which have been explained in my writings; wherefore I am protected by the Lord Himself from the many desperate attempts and attacks of evil spirits. The way in which spirits and men are kept apart is this; spirits are kept in spiritual and men in natural thought and speech; whereby they are separated so as to make one only by correspondences; the nature of which has likewise been treated of. As long therefore as spirits are in a spiritual, and men in a natural state, they are not brought together so as to converse with one another, although they are together in affection; but when spirits converse with men they are out of their spiritual state, and in a natural state like men, and then they may bring them into danger of soul and life, as has been stated above. For this reason they have to be kept apart, so that the spirits do not know anything of man, nor man of them, although they are always together; for man cannot live unless he be associated with spirits, through whom he is connected with heaven and hell, and thereby receives his life.

I declare in truth, that this is so. This took place with me on account of the church, which I mention above, the doctrine of which is contained in my books. The gift of conversing with spirits and angels cannot be transferred from one person to another, unless the Lord himself, as has been the case with me, opens the sight of the spirit of that person. It is sometimes granted to a spirit to enter and to communicate some truth to a man; but still leave is not given to the man to speak with him mouth to mouth. This is also most dangerous, because the spirit enters into the affection of man’s own love, which does not agree with the affection of heavenly love. “With respect to the man who is infested by spirits, I have heard from heaven, that this was caused by a state of meditation in which he indulged; but that no danger is to be apprehended from them, because he is protected by the Lord.

It is further true that I conversed with the person whose name is mentioned in the journal in question, and six months ago with Stanislaus, King of Poland, which took place in a certain congregation or company in which he was, where no one knew who he was.

I will first give you a brief account of things as they have happened. Upon my return from abroad the last time, I was informed that Bishop Filenius had confiscated my work entitled De Amore Conjugiali, which had appeared in Holland and had been sent to Norrköping. I therefore immediately inquired of some bishops whether this had been authorized by the House of the Clergy; they answered that they were aware of the confiscation, but that no general action had been taken, and that not a word about it had been entered upon the Minutes. Immediately afterwards the clergy from Gottenburg made a noise in their House about my books, and pushed matters so far, that the House appointed a committee de Swedenborgianismo [on Swedenborgianism], which consisted of bishops and professors. This committee sat for several months, and at last reported handsomely and reasonably on that subject, and thereby suppressed completely the disturbance which had been made; but to put an end to it still more effectually, it was resolved that a humble memorial should be addressed to Your Royal Majesty, requesting that the Chancellor of Justice should inquire about the disturbances which had arisen in Gottenburg. When the Bishop and the Dean of that place, who are the torch and trumpet [fax et tuba] in this affair, discovered that they made no progress in the reverend House of the Clergy, they, to stir up and kindle the flame anew, commenced a publication of twenty sheets or more  35.

Of all this, from beginning to end, I received not the least intimation; all was done without my receiving a hearing; when yet the whole matter was about ‘Swedenborgianism,’ and the papers printed in Gottenburg are filled with coarse and reprehensible language without touching materially on the subject of ‘Swedenborgianism,’ which is the worship of the Lord our Savior. Of these printed papers I had no other knowledge than what I received from a general commissary of war at Elsinore, and afterwards from a friend here in Stockholm who lent them to me for a day. Wherefore I still insist that everything that has taken place since my return home, has from beginning to end, been done without giving me a hearing. “From a rumor which has spread here in town I have learned that from the office of the Chancellor of Justice a communication has been made to the Consistory of Gottenburg, to the effect that my books have been entirely forbidden to be imported into this country, and, further, that the same office has stigmatized my revelations as untrue and false. In reply to this I humbly beg to make the following statement: That our savior visibly revealed himself before me, and commanded me to do what I have done, and what I have still to do; and that thereupon He permitted me to have communication with angels and spirits, I have declared before the whole of Christendom, as well in England, Holland, Germany, and Denmark, as in France and Spain, and also on various"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"EXTRACTS FROM CORRESPONDENCE 1065 occasions in this country before their Royal Majesties, and especially when I enjoyed the grace to eat at their table, in the presence of the whole royal family, and also of five senators and others; at which time my mission constituted the sole topic of conversation. Subsequently, also, I have revealed this before many senators; and among these Count Tessin, Count Bonde, and Count Hopken have found it in truth to be so, and Count Hopken, a gentleman of enlightened understanding, still continues to believe so; without mentioning many others, as well at home as abroad, among whom are both kings and princes. All this, however, the office of the Chancellor of Justice, if the rumor is correctly stated, declares to be false; when yet it is the truth. Should they reply that the thing is inconceivable to them, I have nothing to gainsay, since I am unable to put the state of my sight and speech into their heads, in order to convince them; nor am I able to cause angels and spirits to converse with them; nor do miracles happen now; but their very reason will enable them to see this, when they thoughtfully read my writings, wherein much may be found which has never before been discovered, and which cannot be discovered except by real vision, and communication with those who are in the spiritual world. In order that reason may see and acknowledge this, I beg that one of your Excellencies may peruse what has been said on this subject in my book, De Amore Conjugiali, in a memorable relation on pages 314 to 316; his Excellency Count Ekeblad and his Excellency Count Bjelke possess the book. If any doubt should still remain, I am ready to testify with the most solemn oath that may be prescribed to me, that this is the whole truth and a reality, without the least fallacy. That our Savior permits me to experience this, is not on my own account, but for the sake of a sublime interest which concerns the eternal welfare of all Christians.

What else results from this, but that in agreement with the resolution any severe treatment may be brought forward by the Consistory of Gottenburg and Bishop Filenius, and my sentence may be pronounced upon me, without my being heard in the affair at all; for of what use is a declaration or a defense after the sentence has been pronounced? “This is the reason why, as I said above, ‘I am compelled to have recourse to Your Majesty, since I have been treated as no one has ever been treated before in Sweden since the introduction of Christianity, and still less since the establishment of freedom;’ by being treated as I have been, without a hearing being granted me. “As this, however, concerns not only my writings, but as a natural consequence my person also, I make a humble request, that the memorial should be communicated to me which was addressed to Your Royal Majesty in this matter by the House of the Clergy, likewise the minutes of the Privy Council, and the letter which was dispatched from the office of the Chancellor of Justice to the Consistory of Gottenburg, in order that I may at once be heard, and may show forth the whole of my treatment before the public at large. “In respect to Doctors Beyer and Rosen of Gottenburg, I have given them no other advice than that they should approach our Savior, Jesus Christ, to whom all power has been given in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18), and should strive after their salvation; and as far as I have been able to learn, they have affirmed and insisted on this one point, which is also in conformity with the Augsburg Confession, the Formula Concordiae, and the whole Word of God; nevertheless for this acknowledgment alone they have become to a certain extent martyrs, at least so far as regards the cruel persecutions of the Bishop and the Dean of that town."},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"EXTRACTS FROM CORRESPONDENCE 1067 The same expression also I apply to my books, which I regard as my own self, when, nevertheless, all that the Dean of Gottenburg has poured out against them, consists of sheer invectives, which do not contain a particle of truth. “Your Royal Majesty’s most humble and most dutiful servant and subject, “Emanuel Swedenborg.

If the account about him is true, it proves the communication of spirits with man. A genteel and rich family here in Stockholm are desirous of taking the boy into their house, and of educating him in whatever branch he may wish to learn. Should this arrangement be acceptable to the boy, and an opportunity present itself of his being brought here in company with a person traveling this way, the family would be pleased; in that case thirty dalers in silver might be furnished him to cover his traveling expenses, and if on his arrival he address himself to me, he will be taken to the family. “I pass by his vision of white serpents, as this took place in his tender infancy; for which reason I do not enter into its explanation; besides, it may be explained either negatively or affirmatively. But his knowing the use of herbs and [the cure of] certain diseases, if really the case, is not on account of such diseases and cures existing in the other life among spirits and angels. There are, however, spiritual diseases [and cures] corresponding to natural diseases and cures in this world; wherefore when such effects take place, they are due to correspondences. As there are no natural diseases among spirits in the spiritual world, neither are there any hospitals; but instead of these there are spiritual madhouses, in which are those who theoretically denied God, and in others such as denied Him practically. Those who in the world were idiots, on their arrival in the other world are likewise foolish and idiotic; but when their  37.

I wish to give here the signification of a manger, of the baptism of John, and of Elias. A manger signifies instruction from the Word, because mules and horses signify the understanding of the Word (see Apocalypse Revealed, n. 298); and a manger contains their food; there being no room in the inn, signifies that there was no place of instruction in Jerusalem; wherefore it is said to the shepherds, who signify the church to come, ‘This shall be the sign unto you; ye shall find the babe lying in a manger’ (Luke 2:12). The baptism of John prepared the heavens, so that the Jewish people might subsist, when God Himself should come down among them. John signified all the prophecies in the Old Testament respecting the Lord and His advent; likewise Elias, because he was the chief of the prophets. “As here [in Stockholm] they now begin to think more of charity than before, asserting that faith and charity cannot be separated, therefore faith alone begins also to be called Moravian faith.

Wherefore the same argument and the same confirmation, which the believers of nature derive hence, are to me an argument for, and a confirmation of, a continual influx from the spiritual into the natural world.

By the Divine mercy of God Messia h, it was permitted several times, to communicate thoughts to the life, with those who are in that intellectual heaven, or by thoughts to have communication with them, and by other means to speak with them. Yea, it was given to purify my thoughts to that degree, that they came immediately into contact with those who were in the heaven of intellectual faith. Then it was observed that they were those, who in the more interior sense, are meant by Gad; for although they know, and thus are able to believe that God Messiah, by the Holy Spirit, alone governs them, and that they have power only when immediately excited, still when they were removed, they at first willed to excite some disturbances, but after some contention with me they acquiesced.  40.
