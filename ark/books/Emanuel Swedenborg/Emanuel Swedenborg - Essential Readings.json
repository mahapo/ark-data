For the arduous work of typing (and retyping!) my tortuous manuscript Iwarmly thank Anne Cansell, especially for her cheerfulness when under pressure.And to the Council of the New Church College I would express my appreciation forkind permission to make use of the College facilities.PREFACE It is mainly as a visionary of the realm of the departed, the SpiritualWorld, that Swedenborg is usually thought of and quoted — particularly by thosewho have not actually read him. Others see him as a highly unorthodox evenheretical theologian, difficult to read, but good at pointing out all theillogicalities and flaws of traditional Christian theology. Not so well known,or realized, was his extraordinary ability to correctly anticipate manyessential areas of modern physics, physiology, and key spiritual teachings ofthe New Age. No explanation in terms of Mucky' or unco-ordinated, inspiredguesses satisfactorily accounts for the breadth and depth of his visionaryinsight in these key areas. His thought is far too integrated and cohesive forthat, and indicates that he discovered some essential key to wisdom farsurpassing that of his contemporaries, or, indeed, of most men. And this key isone which may be seen to be highly relevant to the growing endeavour of our ownAge to grasp holistically the nature of the physical and spiritual dimensions oflife. In my introduction I have outlined some of the major anticipationsSwedenborg made of later discoveries in various fields, and have endeavoured toelicit the nature of his key for unlocking the secrets of both the physical andspiritual worlds. In the anthology section, however, I have selectedspecifically from his later spiritual teachings with a view to giving an overallpicture of his spiritual philosophy as it relates particularly to many areas ofcurrent spiritual interest. Each section is introduced by explanatory materialof my own to help bridge the gap of 200 years in terminology and style ofexpression. Swedenborg was a voluminous writer. A Latin style typical of theperiod can often obscure many of his deep insights. It is my hope14 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS that this particular selection of readings andexplanations will bring some of these insights into greater focus and clarity,to reveal the great relevance of Swedenborg's work to holistic spirituality inour time. Michael W. Stanley 1988INTRODUCTION Emanuel Swedenborg was born in Stockholm in 1688 into a wealthyreligious family — his father was Jesper Swedberg, a pious Lutheran pastor wholater became a bishop, and his mother, Sara Behm, a kind gentle soul who diedwhen Emanuel was only eight. He received a classical education at UppsalaUniversity, but Emanuel's main interest soon showed itself to be in mechanicsand chemistry — an obsession with how things work, and the invention of newmechanical contrivances. Swedenborg had a great love of his native country,Sweden, and a strong desire to serve her by helping to bring her into the modernworld of scientific invention and technology, for this was the age of Descartesand Newton and the 'machine' world. His love of making himself useful was toremain with him and become a key doctrine in the spiritual writings of hismature years. The young Emanuel threw himself eagerly into the study of all themathematical and physical sciences of the time, with a particular interest inmineralogy and metallurgy, which were of great practical importance in theeconomy of Sweden. Later he was appointed 4Assessor Extraordinary' of the RoyalBoard of Mines which controlled the whole of Sweden's mining industry. Althoughhe must have become aware of the main ideas of the Neoplatonic and Gnostictradition at the universities where he visited and studied, there is no mentionin Swedenborg's youthful writings of suprasensible orders of reality and theneed to draw on an intuitive source within, which is above reason and factualevidence — key concepts that were later to help him make an amazing number ofanticipations of nineteenth and twentieth century scientific discoveries. Atthis time his view of nature (following Descartes and Newton) was as a greatmachine whose amazing workings could be discovered16 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS by patient observation, experiment, andcalculation. Yet he was no materialist, bent on demonstrating the self-existenceand self-sufficiency of the world revealed by the senses. Perhaps he suddenlysensed he might be going in that direction, for he was soon to develop apowerful overriding concern that the scientific and philosophical thinkers andexperimenters of the time were in danger of losing all sight of God and thesoul. In 1734 at the age of 46, he published his first major scientific work,The Mineral Kingdom, in three parts. The first part, called The Principia, was atheoretical physical hypothesis of the origin of the material world from aninvisible infinite source. The other two parts were exhaustive mineralogicalworks on iron and copper. Besides firmly establishing his reputation as ascientist and as the foremost mineralogist in Europe, it also showed the depthof his thinking into 'causes of things' and is his first work to demonstrate howsound intuitive principles can lead to far reaching scientific anticipations.What we have in The Principia is an application of Neoplatonic levels oremanations of reality coupled with the principles of geometry and dynamics whichwere proving so successful in the mastery of the physical world and its forces.Swedenborg perceived clearly that for anything to exist it must be continuallybeing created from within itself: Being kept in being is constant coming intobeing. AC 775 Since for Swedenborg, space, time, and matter originate from theInfinite which is spaceless, timeless, and matterless, their origin as viewed attheir own physical level, can only be a dimensionless point, which is notlimited in its location, but is universally present everywhere. Since this'natural point', as Swedenborg termed it, is the physical world's nexus with theInfinite, every point must contain in itself infinite energy. We might note herehow modern physics has reached the same point — that the smallest particlesdiscovered may be dimensionless, with the embarrassing situation of havingthereby infinite energies disturbing the mathematical equations. What isthreatening or beckoning physics as an end point, was in fact, Swedenborg'sstarting point. Swedenborg's 'natural point' is the first place where theinfinite creativity of the Divine breaks out, as it were, from a higher timelessand spaceless dimension. Creation proceeds in a step by step process involvingthe withdrawal of energy through constraint or limitation.INTRODUCTION 17 The initial dimensionless point is constrained to move in acertain limited way (a kind of super-vortical spiral), demarcating a form inspace with a non-infinite degree of energy itself. This finite form or particle,has, by the way it is formed, a rotational spin about a polar axis and is itselfconstrained to move in an even more limited way, forming a less energeticparticle. And so on, until an atom is formed with no internal dynamic to moveleft (the 4 inert1 atom used by Newton as the basis for his mechanicaldescription of the world). In his Principia, Swedenborg applied his theory toderive the origin of magnetism (on the basis of his polar * North-South*spinning particles), and the origin of the suns and planetary systems from theaerial atmosphere. His anticipations here have been acknowledged by the SwedishNobel prizewinner, Svante Arrhenius, as follows: If we briefly summarize theideas which were first given expression by Swedenborg, and afterwards, thoughusually in a much modified form — consciously or unconsciously — taken up byother authors in cosmology, we find them to be: The planets of our solar systemoriginate from the solar matter . . . The earth and the other planets havegradually removed themselves from the sun and received a lengthening time ofrevolution . . . The earth's time of rotation, that is to say the day's length,has been gradually increased . . . The suns are arranged around the milky way .. . There are still greater systems, in which the milky ways are arranged. Otheranticipations that might be added are that stars have axial rotation or spin,and that they move in a spiral course around the Milky Way, and that what arenow called novae are stars throwing off a crust as a ring from which new planetsare formed. Finally Swedenborg also posited the idea that stars may pulsate,giving off radiant vibratory energy. Such stars have in fact now been discoveredand are called pulsars. Swedenborg was well aware that what was missing from hisaccount of finite matter originating from the Infinite Divine as infinitelyenergetic dimensionless points, was the soul or spirit. This becomes clear inhis next work, entitled, The Infinite and Final Cause of Creation, writtenshortly after The Principia and also published in 1734. The final purpose of theDivine creativity is not the physical world of matter, but man, as an immortalsoul.18 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS In the physical world, the 'natural point'would be seen as the nexus between Creator and matter. But what is the linkbetween the Infinite God and man as immortal soul? And what is the link betweenthe soul and the body? In answer to the first Swedenborg hints — withoutexplanation or sign of understanding himself at this stage — that the Christ isthe link. The second question sets him off on his next great quest for the linkbetween soul and body, and proof of the existence of the soul within the body.His starting point was to be a highly detailed anatomical study of the bodyitself. In preparation for this he undertook a journey to France and Italy tolearn dissection and study the leading anatomists of the day. He published theresults, in 1740, in, to say the least, the remarkable book, whose title can betranslated The Organization of the Soul's Kingdom, (usually literally butmisleadingly translated, The Economy of the Animal Kingdom), in which he gives adetailed account of the blood and brain systems of the body, and attempts todraw conclusions as to their underlying causes. In the space of six short yearsthe philosopher scientist of matter has become the philosopher anatomist of thebody, now using Neoplatonic principles more fully to analyse and hypothesize onthe basis of the most recent and detailed anatomical information. We saw howwell the combination of Neoplatonic philosophy and the study of inorganic matterworked in anticipating modem physical discoveries. Will it now also work withorganic matter in the form of the live human body? Numerous physiologicalinductions and intuitions of Swedenborg have since been established by medicalscience, many only in recent times. A few examples are: 1. The coincidence ofthe motion of the brain with respiration. 2. The independence of animatorymotion of the brain and the respiration of the lungs. 3. The extension of therespiratory motion of the brain and lungs to the extremities of the body. 4. Theexistence of the cerebro-spinal fluid. 5. The circulation of the cerebo-spinalfluid through interstices between fibres and nerves of the body. 6. The centralganglia (corpora striata) and spinal ganglia take over some of the movementinitiations of the cerebrum (conditioned reflexes).INTRODUCTION 19 7. The existence of the central canal of the spinal cord. 8. Theoptic lobes are connected with the sense of sight. 9. The seat of consciousnessis in the cortical (grey) elements of the brain. 10. The function of the brainis partly as a 'chemical laboratory1 distributing chemicals through thepituitary gland. 11. The blood is being continually broken down and replaced.12. The quality of the blood depends upon the organ and the person. 13. Thesmallest organic particles ('fibres', 4cortical elements') are independentcentres offerees endowed with individual life. 14. Each organ and * fibre'selects its own requisite nutrients from the blood supplied by the heart'spumping action. (The blood plasma is not forced into the tissues, but drawn inselectively by the tissues themselves). And all this from a man whose primaryaim was not to further scientific knowledge as such, but to find the seat of thesoul in the body and establish its existence! Here we must pause to look atSwedenborg's method of working and reaching his conclusions; for, though theobject on which he was later to focus almost all his attention was to bediscretely different from the human body, the method and a priori principlesused here remained as his constant guides through all his later explorations ofthe spiritual world. First in his methodology comes observation of the outwardfacts. Only occasionally using observations from his own dissection work, hemostly made use of the observations of the best anatomists of the day —Leeuwenhoeck, Malpighi, Ruysch, Bidloo, and others. Then he would apply what hecalled, the 'doctrine of series and degrees' to all the observations in order todiscover interconnections and the functions each part played in the whole, forSwedenborg believed deeply that nothing has been formed which does not have someuse to perform, and which is not of service to and served by the whole, being anintegral part of it. In brief this holistic metaphysic which Swedenborg found soabundantly illustrated in human physiology, is as follows: Creation is of formswhich give the appearance of space, time, substantiality,20 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS and individuality ('space, time, matter, andperson'). Each form is a perpetual emanation from the one invisible InfiniteSource in a series of discrete levels or degrees of form, the last, lowest, oroutermost being that of physical matter. Forms on one level are outgrowths ofconglomerations of the next higher (interior) forms, constrained by a withdrawalof a degree of freedom and energy to move in a definite pattern. The whole chaincan be viewed as being in 'Chinese box' fashion, series of forms within forms,with the one Source at the centre of each and every form. The pattern of eachform in some way corresponds to some facet of the higher form from which itperpetually emanates. Relative to lower forms, higher forms are more pure,perfect, interior, simple, permanent, flexible, universal, distinct, beautiful,free, unanimous, and potent. When not obstructed, higher forms draw theirvarious derivative lower forms into a harmonious unity, forming an image of theOne, with its infinitely distinct variety of parts indissolubly linked into awhole. Thus the higher forms endeavour to 'subordinate and co-ordinate' thelower forms, so that all parts respect and depend on each other and serve thewhole. Higher forms give being and purpose to lower forms, which themselves canlook to the higher forms on which they depend and which they serve. Whilst eachform is accomplishing its own purpose, it is also accomplishing the common oruniversal purpose of the whole. Higher forms are free with respect to lowerforms. They are not destroyed by the dissolution of their lower forms. Hence thesoul survives the dissolution of the body. They may or may not consent to whatis excited at the lower degree. The human body is the blueprint of the mostperfect order to be found in the whole of creation. It is noteworthy that thislast insight had come to Swedenborg long before he wrote his Principia on theevolution of the inorganic elements. In fact, from some of his unpublishedmaterial, it becomes clear that that work was intended to make way for a studyof the human soul as it forms and governs the organic material of the humanbody. Again, we are brought to realize that Swedenborg was not seekingscientific discoveries at all, but a means to prove rationally to the atheistthat the body lives from an immortal soul which itself lives from God. In afollow up work in 1744, on other organs of the body, entitled The Kingdom of theSoul (The Animal Kingdom) Swedenborg, still concerned about the threat ofgrowing agnosticism wrote:INTRODUCTION 21 These pages of mine are written with a view to those only whonever believe anything but what they can receive with the understanding. Suchpersons are inclined to deny the existence of anything more sublime thanthemselves, like the soul. Such things as immortality and heaven they deny asempty phrases and fables. AK Voll 22 We have noted some of the enormousscientific spin-off of Swedenborg's application of the 'doctrines of series,degrees, and correspondence' to the physical body, but what of his treatment ofthe mental part of the human being? At first he followed a tripartite divisionof mind, reminiscent of the Neoplatonic division, into a lower instinctual mindaffected directly by the senses, a rational mind capable of reflecting on thecontents of the lower mind, and an intuitive 'pure intellect', prior andsuperior to, more universal and perfect than, the rational mind. Whereas thelower mind is born with no innate ideas (following Locke), the pure intellect —which is above thought, is what gives the rational mind its power to recognizenatural as opposed to spiritual truths. Relative to the rational mind, the pureintellect comprehends intuitively and holistically rather than separately, aswell as non- temporally and non-spacially; it neither develops nor deteriorates.When later, the spiritual world became visible to him, and it became clear thatits own structure and anatomy was identical with that of the physical body, heanticipated the discovery of the Nobel Laureate, Roger Sperry, in the 1960s,that the right half of the brain enables the mind to respond intuitively andholistically to experience, whilst the left half enables it to analyse andrationalize its experience. However, even before this discovery of the nature ofthe spiritual world, in a subsequent unpublished work devoted almost entirely tothe subject of the mind itself, Swedenborg makes it clear that there are levelsabove (within) even the pure intellect, namely that of a truly spiritual natureor intelligence, and above that, of Divine Wisdom itself. One important idea isthat of a communion of souls, that souls are linked with each other through somekind of vibrations which can be felt by the soul. In his Rational Psychology,Swedenborg talks of the purpose of creation as being 'a most perfect society ofsouls'. In a most perfect form of society, there must be not only a variety ofall22 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS souls but a variety where the several soulsare in such concord that together they constitute a society wherein nothing canbe lacking which is not to be found in someone's soul. Such is the form in theatmospheric world of macrocosm; such it is among the constituent parts in everyindividual body, that is, among its fibres, cortical glands, etc This variety Icall harmonic, being a variety where all the varied constituents mutually relatethemselves to each other by a certain natural analogy, and in this wayconstitute a society which is a one. RP 535 So here, Swedenborg comes close tohis later spiritual discovery — that all souls are arranged in spiritual spacein relation or correspondence to the functional relationships of themultitudinous parts of the human body. This he was to call the Maximus Homo,literally, 'Greatest Man' (previously translated 'Grand Man', and now sometimestranslated, * Universal Human*). Swedenborg now begins to refer a little more tosuch religious topics as, God, Christ, heaven and hell, good and evil. Butsuccessful though he obviously is in worldly terms, he is not happy in himself,and is inclined to states of melancholy. From a private diary he began keepingin 1743 we realize that he is having trouble living up to his inceasinglyawakened inner feelings. Not surprisingly, pride turns out to be his biggestspiritual problem and, perhaps, some concern over his love of worldly things.The diary, kept for about eighteen months, is essentially a record of his veryvivid dreams at that time, and his interpretation of their significance for him.What ensued was a classic struggle between his higher and lower self, arecurring inner conflict that he later termed 'temptation combats'. Women in hisdreams he interpreted as his muses, the aspects of life to which he was drawnand loved. The overtly sexual nature of several of these dreams, andSwedenborg*s ease in writing about intimate sexual details precludes any kind ofFreudian repression interpretation. Swedenborg's own interpretations of thewomen in his dreams is in relation to his love of science, philosophy, andspiritual truth, and his need to leave the former in order more fully to embracethe latter. His interpretations are perfectly corroborated by his subsequentchange of life, with its accompanying serenity and calmness of wisdom. In short,Swedenborg believed his dreams indicated a change taking place within himself, achange necessitating that he relinquish his present goal and methods — ofproving the existence of the soul through a study of humanINTRODUCTION 23 anatomy, in order to prepare himself for some higher path ofservice to humanity. Ceasing publication of further planned volumes of hisOrganization of the Human Soul he wrote instead, a delightful poetic account ofthe Biblical creation story, called The Worship and Love of God, incorporating,in footnotes, elements of his philosophical/physiological insights. From thistime on the Bible was to form the main basis for Swedenborg's study, analysis,and deductions — not as a book to be understood according to its literalmeaning, but as an allegorical account of the Journey of the soul itself. Whathad happened to cause so great a change in Swedenborg's direction in life? Itseems that he experienced, in a dramatically humbling way, a manifestation ofthe Christ and His love. For years Swedenborg had been well used to rationallydiscussing and analysing the subject of love — from the outside. But how one'slife is changed when suddenly love is experienced from the inside! Bothmetaphorically and literally a whole new world was shortly to open up beforeSwedenborg's eyes; for gradually, during the year 1745 he writes of having beenadmitted into the kingdom of God 'by the Messiah Himself, and speaking therewith various heavenly personages and 'with the dead who have risen again'. Forthe remaining 27 years of his life he recorded in detail experiences of theinner spiritual world, seen, heard and felt by his spiritual senses, and theinner world of the Bible as it unfolds before his spiritual intuition.Resolutely he gave up his worldly career and devoted himself totally to his newcalling — to unfold the inner spiritual meaning of the Bible, and explore thenature of the real spiritual world from direct experience of his spiritualsenses. Preparing himself with compilations of Biblical indices, learningHebrew, recording his spiritual world experiences, and making severalpreliminary attempts at perceiving the journeying and development of the soul inthe pages of the Old Testament, he eventually published in 1749 a complete verseby verse outline of the symbolic meaning of the books of Genesis and Exodus.This work in eight volumes (twelve in English) entitled, Arcana Caelestia, orHeavenly Secrets, stands as a marvel of sustained psychospiritual insights,despite a heavy, pedantic theological style,24 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS calculated many might think, to keep theheavenly secrets, if such they were, secret! Of the many spiritual books thatfollowed, I will mention just a few of his distinctive major works. A fullerlist is given in the Bibliography. In Heaven and Hell', perhaps his best knownand most read work, he published in 1758 a spiritual and experiential analysisof the spiritual world he had been experiencing for the last 13 years. This bookis no mere spiritualist travelogue of other-worldly scenery and architecture; itis a magnificent attempt to help the reader understand the whole spiritual worldas an outward image portraying the soul, the Divine, and the ego's distortions.Divine Love and Wisdom, published in 1763, outlines his mature understanding ofthe doctrine of creation in emanations, spheres (or auras), series, and degrees.It concludes with a section devoted to the § interplay of will and understandingin the mind and its correspondence as mirrored in the interaction of the heartand lungs in the body. Divine Providence, published the following year, outlineshow the Divine Nature inevitably involves an inviolate order in its operation,which governs all that It has created, particularly in relation to thedistortions of life introduced by man. The early chapters contain some ofSwedenborg's endeavours to express the deeper mystical relationship of finiteman to his infinite source in God. Then, in a book entitled Conjugial Love,published in 1768, Swedenborg turned his attention to an area which has been sopoorly understood, if not misunderstood, by exoteric Christianity — sexualityand the union of man and woman. Similar though it might appear in some ways toalchemical teachings concerning the union of masculine and feminine in the soul,it differs in its practical application of deep spiritual fundamentals to theactual situation of men and women faced with sexual urges, eros, and deeperlongings for soul union with a mate. Swedenborg returned again to Biblicalinterpretation in his Apocalypse Revealed, published in 1766. Working verse byverse on the last book of the Bible, he sees in it the 'harvesting of the good'after the 'tares' of evil, fully grown, have had their fling and have finallybeen overthrown. Swedenborg expresses his insights in relation to the life andteachings of corporate religions such as the Catholic and Reformed churches,showing how subtle evils and falsities developINTRODUCTION 25 in disguised forms in churches, until a crucial point is reachedwhen, according to Divine Order, a Last Judgment takes place, which spirituallyseparates the matured good from the fully grown evil within those within thechurches. His final major work published in 1771, the year before his death, heentitled The True Christian Religion. It provides a kind of compendium of hismajor theological teachings, often expressed in the Protestant terminology ofthe day. In some ways a magnificent summary, it lacks, in the view of thiswriter, the psychospiritual and mystical depths of many of his earlier works,presumably being written to answer the theologians of the day in their ownterms. Swedenborg died peacefully in London, in 1772, at the age of 84, still inthe full mental vigour that had been his gift all his life, and calmly andhappily looking forward to an unending life in a universal spiritual world grownvery familiar to him.1 STRUCTURE OF SWEDENBORG'S SPIRITUAL THOUGHT Swedenborg's uncanny ability tocorrectly intuit several key aspects of modern physics and very many laterphysiological discoveries up to the present (and beyond?) calls for explanation.Space will not permit an examination of this intriguing and important subject ina book such as this. Suffice it to say here that a part of the answer may welllie in his application of Hermetic- Neoplatonic principles to the currentphysiological knowledge of his day, particularly his Doctrine of Correspondence.Universality Swedenborg teaches the underlying unity of all life, emanating fromthe one infinite Source described as Love Itself, and that all life is ondifferent discrete levels and in forms which are related to or part of anoverall form or organism, which he calls — the Grand Man or Universal Human. Inthe physical body this form is perfectly mirrored in the hierarchical andinterrelated functions of its organs and cells. In the mind the same pattern isseen in the various mental functions, with the will corresponding to the heart,and the understanding to the lungs. The higher mind, or spirit, is itself anintegral part of the Universal Human: and the inmost soul itself is the form ofwhat Swedenborg calls the Divine Human, or Son of God — the Christ of thegospels. Thus, in essence, mankind is one community, and every religion a partof the one timeless universal religion. Man's inmost thoughts and feelings,therefore, are not from himself, but part of a flow of life at the higher levelsof the Divine emanation. Yet, at each of these levels, each man or spirit has adistinct personality enabling him to take his place (if he is willing to allowthe higher inner levels to govern him) in the perfection of the whole. SpiritualFreedom In his inner reaches, therefore, man is eternally united to the oneSource, but in his outer levels he is free to respond either in correspondencewithSPIRITUAL THOUGHT 27 his higher self or to distort the one universal pattern oflife (the latter choice being the origin of evil). The superior inner levels arethe 'heaven within'. Basically two in number, there is a higher level calledcelestial, which is essentially a love and deep appreciation of the whole or Oneor Good Itself (the Lord), and a lower level, the spiritual, which isessentially a love and awareness of the goodness of all the parts of the whole(the neighbour). The celestial degree is holistic and mystical, the spiritualdegree being more analytic and structured. Union with the Lord and the neighbourHowever, when man is living in the non-heavenly realms of his spirit, unaware ofhis inner heaven and divine sonship, as is inevitable at first, he feels no lovefor the Lord or the neighbour, but separated from them; he is in a state ofseparation termed hell. There are, of course, many degrees of this state fromthe very mild to the grotesquely horrifying (outer darkness). In such a state heis unable to experience the unity of love (of the Lord or the neighbour). Now,only revelation from the Divine — the light above (within his soul) — canpenetrate the darkness, reaching down to rescue (redeem) him. The Divine Wordcalls to the soul through manifested forms or images — through the beauty ofnature, through music or dreams, but, in particular (as in Swedenborgfs owncase) through the written form of sacred scripture. When the Word is received,the Divine (Holy) Spirit is enabled to awaken the separated depths in man andstir his heart (or will) to turn around (repent) and seek union with the whole(with the Lord and the neighbour). The son is called, hears, and chooses toreturn home to his Father. Doctrine of Use When this reunion occurs, the lowerwill unites with the Divine will, and loves to do whatever is useful, that is,conducive to the good and happiness of the whole. This is the love of good,usefulness, or service. The highest awareness of the truth is thus linked withthe motivation to serve the true spiritual interests of all the parts (spirits)in spiritual and practical ways. Far from the individual part feeling lostthrough union with the One, on the contrary it feels most distinctly anduniquely itself, whilst sensing itself as belonging as a part of the whole. Theobject of man's highest love is not, therefore, the Infinite, which he cannotever comprehend, but the Divine Human or Christ which is the form of the Wholewhich his higher mind can perceive and relate to. The Fall Proprium,meaning4what belongs to oneself, is the word Swedenborg uses28 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS for the capacity of man to experience life asif he were independent of the One (God). The similarity of proprium to the modemuse of 'ego' to indicate the area of 'I-ness* or self identity in the field ofconsciousness, is clear. It is the proprium's (or ego's) interpetation of whatit sees and feels with the bodily senses that creates the great illusion intowhich man falls — the belief that he is separate, independent, and essentiallyalone in a huge alien world. Thence arise all the negative emotions of fear,shame, guilt, envy, hatred, etc. Though man's world is at first thus fallen, itis into that world that Redemption comes. Incarnation and Redemption There was apoint in time in the history of mankind's spiritual decline on earth when theincreasing degree of spiritual darkness grew dangerously close to making itimpossible for any one to 'see the light' which enables the Divine within toincarnate and redeem his world. At that time the Divine sent forth out of Itselfa special birth of a Son who was to be the Light itself to shine in man'sdarkness. That unique incarnation took place in the form of Jesus of Nazareth,in whom the grand battle between the powers of darkness and light was enacted,in which Jesus as the Christ 'overcame the hells through temptation combats' inhis soul. The total victory gained by Jesus preserved man's spiritual freedom tosee the light and return to the Father, and brought Jesus Christ into a completeand total union with the Divine Father (the glorification of the Lord). Thiscombative pattern of regeneration or spiritual growth needs to occur within eachindividual (fallen) man: the entrance of light, or the Incarnation (birth ofChrist within); recognition and acknowledgement of proprium (egoicself-centredness); repentance — the 'turning around' to return to the Fatherwithin in love and freedom; redemption — the Divine rescue of the soul from thehellish bonds of the 'proprial' illusion and selfishness. Thus, through man, theChrist within eternally redeems man's world. Regeneration This whole process ofreturn (regeneration) is like a new birth. The seed, as remnant states ofheavenly experiences, is implanted in man's natural awareness from physicalbirth onwards. Regenerating man goes through cycles of enlightenment,alternating with an emerging awareness of some evil or 'hellish' proprialtendency which has been lurking — often well disguised — in a deeper part of hismind or life. The ensuing battle, called temptation combat, is between theChrist within (the Light) and the powersSPIRITUALTHOUGHT 29 of darkness (the hells). Victory over the evil is achievedthrough a combination of man's willingness and acceptance of the power of theDivine within, while felt as though all the effort were man's own. In this way,the Divine and man are as one and united in the inner struggle and, afterwards,man enjoys the inner peace, humility, and joy that is God's within him, and heis then in the state of heaven. This purifying process is repeated eternally,since total purification of the natural consciousness and life is nevercompletely attained. Life After Death After the death of the physical body,states of the inner world manifest outwardly in corresponding forms, mirroringthe heaven, hell, or intermediate states that are being lived in at the time.Since this is a shared world, one is able to associate and communicate withothers who are sharing the same region of spiritual space, that is, a similarinner spiritual condition. The existence of the physical body normally preventsany conscious awareness of this spiritual phenomenon but, in certaincircumstances, awareness is permitted to break through, giving consciouscommunication between spirits and men. Those living in the heavenly regions oftheir spirit are called angels, and those living in the hellish parts are calledevil spirits, or sometimes devils. Conjugial Love In addition to the division,reality/illusion and heaven/hell in man, there is also a division between heartand mind — or between subjective feelings and objective logical thought. In themale the objective thought aspect is more conscious, with the subjective feelingaspect more unconscious. With the female, the reverse is the case. The male is,as it were, the explorer of new territory (producer of wisdom) and the female isthe integrator and nurturer of what is discovered (lover of the wisdom thusproduced). So the unconscious elements in one sex resonate with and stir themore overt elements in the other. When a truly deep fundamental uniting of bothaspects takes place through the union of man with his appropriate femalecounterpart, Swedenborg calls it a conjugial union. And the human pair who arein conjugiai love essentially form one angel — not in body or outer mind but ininner heart, mind, and soul. Dispensations of the Ages The inner transformative(regenerative) cycles in the individual spirit have their collective counterpartin groups (churches), both small and large, both less and more general orglobal. With the most general of these, the spiritual dispensations or ages,there have been four since the beginning of mankind30 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS on earth, with a fifth (the age of the NewJerusalem) about to begin. Each age has begun with a special Divine revelationin a distinctive form; each has ended with a phase of fully grown spiritualcorruption and distorted teaching which has needed to be judged (clearly seenfor what it is and separated out from the remaining pure elements from which thenext spiritual age or era develops). One such Judgment illustrated mythically inthe Bible is the story of Noah and the Flood. The distinctive characteristics ofwhat is best in each of these ages is mirrored in the psychological developmentof potential in the individual, from infancy through childhood, adolescence, andearly manhood to the wisdom of old age. New Age Swedenborg foretold that the NewAge to come will be marked by a maturity in the form of the predominence of trueinner freedom from dogma and authoritarianism of all kinds — the inner freedomthat only wisdom in mankind's old age can bring, the freedom that God's Willbrings — to joyfully accept and live in harmony with our true (highest) nature,which is to be a unique and integral part of the whole Universal Human whosesoul is the Divine Itself. • • • • • Such, in brief, is an attempt to distilsome of the essentials of Swedenborg's thought. It should be borne in mind,however, that although he may never have achieved this spiritual philosophywithout absorbing much of the ancient wisdom and Neoplatonic-Gnostic framework,or without his full-waking experience of the departed in their manifestedspiritual world, the basis for his detailed spiritual psychology of soul growthwas the Bible itself. And within the sacred scripture of the Bible he found theDivine Word that revealed to him the dynamic pattern and stages of the fall andrebirth of the soul. It is to this Word that he recalls the reader again andagain, to study and meditate, with the aid of a 'true doctrine of God and man'.The corresponding link between the inner and outer worlds offers a key to eachand every man to receive for himself the light of the Divine Truth. Byexpressing his spiritual experiences and perceptions in a natural rationallanguage and outlining clearly how the key of correspondence works, particularlyin sacred scriptures, he has endeavoured to open a door for modern 'rational'man to go through, to find for himself, the truth, the heaven within, and hisessential union with the Divine. It is the part of a wise man to see andperceive truth from the lightSPIRITUALTHOUGHT 31 of heaven, but not to confirm what is said by others, AE 190No others apprehend the genuine sense of the Word than those who areenlightened. And those alone are enlightened who are in love and faith in theLord, for their interiors are elevated by the Lord even into the light ofheaven. AC 103232 DIVINE NATURE Swedenborg begins several of his major works with an endeavourto reveal his own perception of the Divine nature. In his view nothing is morevital for a man than the conception he has of God, or the Divine, for man'sspirit would develop in that direction and so determine his true character andstate. How important it is to have a right idea of God, can be established fromthis, that the idea of God constitutes the inmost thought with all who have areligion, for all things of religion and all things of worship have respect toGod. Also because God, universally and in particular, is in all things ofreligion and worship, so without a right idea of God, no communication with theheavens is possible. DLW 13 The idea of God is the chief of all ideas. For aman's communication with heaven and conjunction with the Lord are qualified bythis idea. And hence such are his enlightenment, affection for truth and good,perception, intelligence, and wisdom; for these things are not from man, butfrom the Lord, according to conjunction with him. AE9573 The whole of religionis based upon the idea held about God, and is in conformity with it. Can 1Infinite and Eternal (Spaceless and Timeless) Swedenborg was well aware of theunknowable nature of the Divine as it is in itself— beyond the bounds of spaceand time, and all man's finite ability to conceptualize. The Divine is Infinite,and of the Infinite nothing else can be said than that it is the Itself, or ItIs, thus Good Itself. AC 12619 It is known that the Divine, because it isInfinite, does not fall into the ideas of thought of any man or angel, becausethey are finite, andDIVINE NATURE 33 the finite is not capable of perceiving the infinite. AR 312 Inthe Lord there is nothing but what is Infinite, and since It is Infinite, Itcannot be apprehended by any idea but as the being (esse) and manifestation(existere) of all good and truth. AC 2803 Nevertheless the concept of theinfinite (as in mathematics) can and should have an important place in ourintuitive perception. Although the human mind may acknowledge from the manythings in the created universe that the primary entity or first Being isInfinite, yet it cannot know Its nature, and therefore cannot define Itotherwise than the Infinite All. The human mind can only declare that thissubsists in Itself and consequently is the very and only Substance;. . . Butwhat do these conclusions amount to as they throw no light on the nature of theInfinite? For the human mind, although highly analytical and elevated, is itselffinite, and its finite quality cannot be separated from it. It is therefore,quite, incapable of comprehending the infinity of God as It is in Itself, andthus God. It may however see Him obscurely, as it were, from behind . . . thevisible things in the world, and in particular the things apparent in the Word.Hence it is clear that it is vain to desire to know what God is in His Being orin His Substance. It is enough to acknowledge Him from finite, that is, createdthings, in which He is infinitely. TCR 28 What the Infinite and Eternal iscannot be comprehended by the finite, and yet it can be. It cannot becomprehended because the finite cannot contain the infinite; and it can becomprehended because there are abstract ideas by means of which it can be seenthat things exist, though not what their nature is. DP 46 That the Infinite inItself and the Eternal in Itself is the Divine can be seen by men, and yetcannot be seen. It can be seen by those who think of the Infinite not from spaceand of the Eternal not from time; but it cannot be seen by those who think ofthe Infinite and the Eternal from space and time. DP 48 Clearly the problem isrelated to man's natural tendency to see and experience spacially andtemporally. There are two things proper to nature—space and time. It is fromthese that man in the natural world forms the ideas of his thought and thence34 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS of his understanding. If he remains in theseideas and does not raise his mind above them, he can never perceive anythingspiritual and divine, for he involves them in ideas derived from space and time,and in proportion as he does this, the light of his understanding becomes merelynatural. DLW69 In contrast, the heavenly state leans increasingly away from thenatural emphasis on time and space. In the other life there is nothing of spaceand time, but there are states according to which are appearances of space andtime; and the life is more heavenly the further it is removed from what is ofspace and time, and the nearer it is to what is eternal, in which there isnothing at all of the idea of time, or of anything analogous. AC 26546Swedenborg exhorts his reader to raise his mind beyond ideas of space and timein order to comprehend something of the infinite and eternal. But do not, Ientreat you, confound your ideas with time and space, for insofar as anything oftime and space is present in your ideas when you read what follows, you will notunderstand it. For the Divine is not in time and space. DLW 51 Creation itselfcannot be brought within the comprehension unless space and time are removedfrom thought, but if these are removed, it can be comprehended. Remove them, ifyou can, or as much as you can, and keep in your mind an idea abstracted fromspace and time, and you will perceive there is no difference between the maximumand the minimum of space . . . There are infinite things in God-man . . . andthese innumerable things exist as in an image [of the God- man] in the createduniverse. DLW 155 The Divine is far from unknowable in its ongoing activity ofmanifesting Itself in countless ways. (Today we might use the illustration ofelectricity — invisible in itself, yet experienceable through its effects.) Itis approachable, yet not directly and fully attainable. Universal nature is atheatre representative of the Lord's Kingdom; thus the Divine is in everyparticular of nature, insomuch that nature is a representation of the Eternaland the Infinite—of the Eternal from prorogation even to eternity, of theInfinite from the multiplication of seeds to infinity. AC 51162DIVINE NATURE 35 Divine Itself as Love How then can man begin to know theunknowable? For Swedenborg, it is clear, the Divine is Love. And it is to 'love'that man should look for direction to approach an awareness and perception ofthe Divine Nature. The Divine itself is pure Love. AC 6849 And how are we tounderstand this ambiguous term 'love' as applied to the Infinite Divine? Beingessentially infinite it is unknowable in itself. The Divine Being Itself is Loveutterly incomprehensible to man. AC 5042 But Love will have countless varyingfacets or aspects, some of which everyone can come to know. Of the manydefinitions of love that Swedenborg gives throughout his works the followingseem to be central and crucial. Love in its essence, is to will, and in itsexistence is to do. For what a man loves, this he wills; and what he wills fromlove, this he does. AC7972 The heavenly or celestial entity of love does notwish to exist for itself but for all, thus to impart all that is its own toothers. It is in this that heavenly love essentially consists. AC 1419 Regardedin itself, love is nothing but a desire and thence a striving for union. CL 37Love in itself is not to love self, but to love others and to be conjoined withthem by love. An essential of love also is to be loved by others, for thus isunion effected. The essence of all love consists in union, it is indeed its lifewhich is called enjoyment, delight, sweetness, blessedness, happiness, andfelicity. Love consists in this that its own is another's; and to feel another'sjoy as joy in oneself, this is to love. DLW47 The most high, or inmost, is thecelestial element of love or Love Itself, to which no other attributes areappropriate than those of pure love and so of pure mercy towards the whole humanrace, that Mercy being such that It wills to save all men, to make themeternally happy, and to impart to them all that is Its own — thus out of puremercy and by the mighty power of love to draw towards heaven, that is, towardsItself, all who are willing to follow. AC 173536 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS The Divine Love Itself, which is love towardsthe whole human race . . . wills to save them and to make them blessed and happyto eternity, and to make Its Divine their own so far as they can receive It. AC47352 Love and Wisdom Within the Divine Itself is the unity of love and wisdom.While the intellectual mind sees them as distinct, Swedenborg explains that inreality one does not exist without the other. The love aspect of this unity isboth essential and invisible: the wisdom aspect on the other hand, is formativeand visible. You cannot have one without the other without losing the essentialnature of this Divine Reality. Love and wisdom are said to be one distinctlybecause they are two distinct things, yet so united that love is of wisdom andwisdom is of love; for in wisdom love is and in love, wisdom exists. DLW34 Thewisdom that does not make one with its love appears to be wisdom, but is not;while the love that does not make one with its wisdom, appears to be the love ofwisdom, but is not. DLW 39 Love shows itself in order to be seen and recognizedin wisdom; and because it is seen there and recognized, wisdom is its image.Moreover love is the being (esse) of life, and wisdom is the manifestation(existere) of life therefrom. The likeness and image of God appear clearly inangels, for love from within shines forth in their faces, and wisdom in theirbeauty; and beauty is the form of their love. DLW 358 Love can be understoodonly from its quality, and its quality is wisdom; and its quality or wisdom canexist only from its being, which is love; hence it is that love and wisdom areone. DP 13 Love and wisdom proceed from the Lord as one, but are not received asone by the angels. And the wisdom which prevails over the love indeed appears aswisdom but yet is not, because in the superabundance of wisdom there is no lifefrom love in it. DLW 125 [The wisdom seen from man's point of view] does notproduce love, but simply teaches and shows the way, teaching how man ought tolive and showing the way he ought to go. DLW 244 Swedenborg endeavours todistinguish for us the characteristics of true wisdom (as opposed tointellectual capacity or mere cleverness).DIVINE NATURE iZ By the power to grow wise is not meant the power to reasonabout truths and goods from knowledge, nor the power to confirm whatever a manpleases, but to discern what is true and good, to choose what is suitable, andapply it to the uses of life. AC 102273 Wisdom is loving use, that is, lovingthe good of a fellow citizen, of society, of one's country, and of the Church.HH 390 To receive good from the Lord and thence to will good, is wisdom. AC 5070The chief thing in wisdom is to perceive without reasoning, that a thing is trueor not. AC 5556 The state of wisdom is when man has no longer any concern aboutunderstanding truths and goods, but about willing and living them; for this isto be wise. AC 102256 Use Conjoined Love and Wisdom is not static butnecessarily looks to and generates a third aspect, the use it can be to others.Thus there exists this fundamental trinity in unity. Without use, love andwisdom are merely abstract ideas of thought . . . but in use, the two arebrought together and become a one which is called real. Love, being the activityof life, cannot rest unless it is doing something; nor can wisdom exist andsubsist except when doing something from love and with it; and doing is use . .. CL 1833 Because the Lord is Love Itself and Wisdom Itself, He is also UseItself. For love has use as its end, which it brings forth by wisdom. Forwithout use, love and wisdom have no boundary or end, that is, no dwelling placeof their own. Consequently, it cannot be said that they have being or existenceunless they have a use in which they are. DLW 230 Everyone who thinks with anyenlightenment can see that love has use for an end, and intends it, and bringsit forth by means of wisdom. For love of itself can bring forth of itself nouse, but can do so by means of wisdom as a medium. Indeed what is love unlessthere is something loved? This something is use, and because use is that whichis loved, and is brought forth by means of wisdom, it follows that use is thevessel of wisdom and love. DLW 29738 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS Good In practice this important term 'use' isinitially equivalent to the concept of 'good*. Use is the doing of good fromlove by means of wisdom. Use is good itself. CL 1833 All good things which existin act are called uses. DLW 336 Truth Just as love is the heart of wisdom, sogood is the heart of truth, and Truth is the form of good, that is, when good isformed so that it may be intellectually perceived, then it is called truth. AC3049 The good which a wise man thinks, is truth, which becomes good when hewills and does it. ISB 7 Creativity The Love and Wisdom (or just Love for short)of the Divine is, by its very nature, creative. For any form to exist (e.g. anatom), it must be being perpetually created and sustained from within itself.Preservation in connection and form is perpetual creation. AC 4822 That theuniverse consists of perpetual uses, produced by wisdom and initiated by love,may be seen as in a mirror by every wise man when he acquires a general idea ofthe universe, and regards its particulars in that light. TCR 41 This createduniverse is not God, though it is made out of Him, but is something, as it were,separate, so that He might dwell in it. The infinite cannot proceed from thefinite. Still the infinite can proceed . . . through the finite. On the otherhand the finite cannot proceed from the infinite; and to say that it can is alsoa contradiction. The finite, however, can be produced from the infinite, butthis is a creating, not a proceeding. DP 2192 Every created thing, by virtue ofits origin, is such in its nature that it may be a recipient of God, not bycontinuity, but by contiguity. By the latter and not by the former there isconjunctivity. For it isDIVINE NATURE 39 in accord, because it has been created in Goxl by God. Andhaving been created thus, it is an analogue, and by this conjunction is like animage of God in a mirror. DLW 56 The resulting creation is a universe whollymade up of interdependent ('coherent') parts. The order is that one thing is forthe sake of another and that one therefore depends on another like a chain onits links. CL 85 The universe is a work coherent from first things to last,because it is a work with ends, causes, and effects indissolubly linkedtogether. Since in all love there is an end, and since in all wisdom there is apromotion of that end through immediate causes and by means of them to effects,which are uses, it follows that the universe is an all embracing work of DivineLove, Divine Wisdom, and uses, and thus a work entirely coherent from firstthings to last. TCR 47 Divine Humanity The most complete, universal, and perfectform of divine manifestation is what is termed by Swedenborg, the Divine Human.This concept bears some relation to the primeval man of Hinduism and the AdamKadmon of the Jewish Kabbalah. In the vision of Swedenborg, and later Blake, themirror in which God can be seen is the essential perfection of humanity. TheInfinite Itself which stands above all the heavens and above man's inmost beingcannot be manifested except by means of the Divine Human, which exists solelywith the Lord. Communication of the infinite with finite being is not possibleat all from any other source. AC 19882 Swedenborg stresses the danger to thefinite mind when it attempts to comprehend and relate to God in other thanthrough His Divine Human. Unless the idea were formed of God that He is thefirst Substance and Form, and that His form is the very Human Form, the minds ofmen would readily acquire for themselves vague, fantastic ideas concerning GodHimself, the origin of man, and the creation of the world. They would regard Godas nature in her first principles, as the expanse of the universe, or as anempty unreality. TCR 20 There is in all the heavens no other idea of God thanthe idea of Man.4Q SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS The reason is that heaven as a whole and inpart is in form like a Man, and the Divine which is with the angels makes aheaven. For this reason it is impossible for the angels to think about God inany other way. DLW 11 Man's union with the Lord is not a union with His supremeDivine Itself, but with His Divine Human; for man can have no idea whatever ofthe Lord's supreme Divine, which so transcends his idea as altogether to perishand become nothing; but he can have an idea of His Divine Human. For everyone isconjoined by thought and affection with one concerning whom he has some idea,but not with one concerning whom he has no idea. AC 42112 Each individual humanbeing is only finite, and in himself can mirror only a facet of the DivineHuman, whereas the angelic heavens taken as a whole, potentially manifest thisDivine Human in its infinitude. The reason men cannot understand how the Creatorof the universe can be in a human [form] is because they form their ideas of theuniverse from the conception of space. Such an idea does not pertain to Godunless there be the idea of the Divine Proceeding. Ath Creed 120 So important infact is a man's conception of this Divine Human form that it determines hisultimate destiny. To all are allotted places in the heavens in accordance withthe concept their faith gives them of the Lord's Divine Human. DD 19 Spirit(Divine Proceeding) Whereas 'Human' indicates the perpetual form of the Divine,'Spirit' or 'Divine Proceeding1 indicates the dynamic aspect of the radiatingsphere, action, or activity. The Holy Spirit is the Divine going forth, thus theDivine Truth teaching, reforming, regenerating, and making alive. Can 11J TheDivine called the Holy Spirit proceeds from God Himself by means of His Human,comparatively to that which proceeds from a man, that is, what he teaches andperforms from his soul by means of his body. Can 32 The Infinite and the Eternalin Itself is the Divine Itself, or the Lord in Himself; but the Infinite andEternal from Itself is the DivineDIVINENATURE 41 Proceeding, that is, the Lord in others created from Himself,thus in men and in angels; and this Divine is the same as the Divine Providence.DP 55 Thus, there are three aspects of divinity. The Divine called the Father,is the Divine Being (esse), the Divine Human called the Son is the DivineManifestation (existere) from that Being; and the Divine called the Holy Spiritis the Divine Proceeding from the Divine Manifestation and from the DivineBeing. This trine is the Lord in heaven. AE 11114 This same trine is in thefinite created human or angel. An angel of heaven is a trine and therefore one.The esse of an angel is called his soul, his existere is called his body, andthe proceeding from both is called the sphere of his life, without which anangel neither exists nor is. It is from this trine that an angel is an image ofGod, and is called a son of God, and also an heir, indeed, also a god. AElllPTrinity The essential trinity in the Divine is now clear — an invisible Sourceor Soul, the Divine Itself; a visible (or bodily) manifestation of this Source,the Divine Human; and an outflowing, radiating energy, the Divine Spirit. Inrelation to the Lord Jesus Christ, this is the Trinity of Father, Son, and HolySpirit; and Swedenborg frequently makes it clear how misleading it is toattribute the plural notion of persons to the Trinity which is really a Unity.When it is said that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three essentials ofone God, like the soul, body and operation in man, it appears to the human mindas if these three essentials were three Persons, which is impossible; but whenit is understood that the Divine of the Father which constitutes the soul andthe Divine of the Son which constitutes the body, and the Divine of the HolySpirit or the Divine Proceeding which constitutes the operation, are the threeessentials of one God, the statement becomes comprehensible. TCR 168 The dangerof limiting spiritual insight by directing the thought to separate individualsis often highlighted. The angels, because they are spiritual, think and speak inthe abstract in regard to such things, and thereby they have intelligence andwisdom;42 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS for an idea of person and place limits thethought, because it confines it to those things, and thus limits it. This ideaof the thought is properly natural whereas an idea apart from person and placeextends itself into heaven in every direction, and is not otherwise bounded bythe sight of the eye while it views the sky without intervening objects; such anidea is properly spiritual. AE 4052 In the spiritual world or in heaven, notpersons but spiritual things are the subject of reflection, for persons limitthe idea, and concentrate it upon something finite; whereas spiritual things donot limit and concentrate it, but extend it to the infinite, thus to the Lord.AC 5225 In the spiritual idea a man is not a person but a use. For a spiritualidea does not embrace any notion of personality, just as it has no reference toideas of matter, space, and time. When therefore, one sees another in heaven, hesees him as a man, but he thinks of him as a use. DL 13A This trinity is stampedon all the living forms of creation (mirroring its Source) as essence, form, andoutflowing sphere or activity. It is within every deed we do as motivation,idea, and action. These three can be said to demarcate three aspects of man asspirit — his will, the vehicle of motivation; his understanding, the vehicle ofidea; and his bodily activity, the vehicle of action. In every Divine work thereis a first, middle, and a last; the first passes through the middle to the last,and so exists and subsists; consequently, the last is the basis. Again, thefirst is in the middle, and by means of the middle is in the last, and thus thelast is the vessel; and because the last is the vessel and the basis, it is alsothe support. It will be comprehended by the learned that these three may becalled end, cause, and effect; also being, becoming, and existing: the end isbeing, the cause is becoming, and the effect is existing. Consequently, ineverything that is complete there is a trine, called the first, the middle, andthe last; also, the end, the cause, and the effect; and also being, becoming,and existing. DSS 27, 28 The Divine Trinity exists in one Divine Person orDivine Human called by Swedenborg, the Lord. The Unity in which is the Trinity,or the one God in whom is the trine, does not exist in the Divine which iscalled the Father, nor in the Divine which is called the Holy Spirit, but in theLord alone; for in the Lord isDIVINE NATURE 43 a trine, that is to say, the Divine called Father, the DivineHuman called Son, and the Divine Proceeding which is the Holy Spirit, and thistrine is One because it is of one Person and maybe called a Triune. AE11063 OneDivine by itself is not possible, but there must be a trine; this trine consistsof esse, existere, and proceeding, for esse must needs exist, and since itexists it must go forth to production, and this trine is one in essence and onein Person, and is God . . . AE 111133 MAN'S NATURE What are man and the world made out of— the Divine, somepre-existing material, or nothing? The last view, in its simplest form,Swedenborg spends little time on. The world in its complex is said to have beencreated out of nothing, and from nothing an idea of absolute nothingness isfostered. Yet out of absolute nothingness, nothing is or can be made. This is anabiding truth. The universe therefore, which is God's image, and hence full ofGod, could only be created in God from God ... yet that which is created in Godfrom God is not continuous from Him. For God is Being in Itself and in createdthings there is not any Being in Itself. If there were in created things anyBeing in Itself, this would be continuous from God and that which is continuousfrom God is God. DLW 55 The second possibility, propounded by Plato and theBiblical Creation story, was that man was made out of a pre-existing materialsubstance (the dust of the earth). Swedenborg differs in regarding materialsubstance as a continual emanation or clothing of the spiritual and Divine,whilst remaining quite distinct from the Divine. Nature was created that thespiritual might be clothed by it with forms to serve for use. AE 12073 In thesubstances and matters out of which the earth is formed, there is nothing of theDivine in Itself, but yet they are from the Divine in Itself. DLW 305 The Lordcreated the universe in order that there might exist in it an infinite andeternal creation from Himself. DP 202 But no one can be created directly fromthe Uncreate, the Infinite,.MAN'S NATURE 45 Being Itself and Life Itself, because the Divine is one and notdivisible, whereas creation must be ... so formed that the Divine can be in[it]. Because men and angels are such they are recipients of life. DLW 4 Inother words, all created forms, including man, come forth from the Divine, arenot the Divine in themselves but are utterly dependent on the Divine everyinstant, for their existence. The Divine as Creator, stands not outside createdforms, but within them. Thus man is created to be 'God's dwelling place', and toreceive qualities of the Divine life as if they were his own. The universal end,that is, the end of all things of creation is that there may be an eternalconjunction of the Creator with the created universe, and that is not possibleunless there are subjects in which His Divine can be as in Itself, thus in whichIt can abide and dwell. And these subjects, in order that they may be Hisdwelling places and mansions, must be recipients of His Love and Wisdom as ofthemselves, thus such as will elevate themselves as if of themselves towards theCreator, and conjoin themselves with Him. No union is possible without thisreciprocity. DLW 170 So man is created as a vessel through which Life manifestsin a special way. He is not Love Itself, but a potential manifestor of a finitefacet of Love received from the Divine Source. In this sense he is an image ofhis Creator in a far more perfect or complete way than other forms of creationin the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms. As an image then, he is alsoessentially love or motivation. Love is the life of man. DLW 1 Threefold Focusof Love in Man Man finds his love can be drawn to or directed towards threetypes of object, namely his creative Source (God), God's creations, especiallythe human race, and himself. These Swedenborg calls respectively, love to theLord, love toward the neighbour or charity, and love of self. Here Swedenborg isusing a terminology based on appearances — the apparent separateness of myself,other persons, and God. However, we will gravely misunderstand his use of theseterms if we do not heed his warning against thinking from person, rather thanfrom the quality or good that is in a person. This becomes clearer when we findhim adding a fourth type of love, love of the world, and classifying both thisand love of self as evil. The love of the world rules with a man, that is, a manis in the love46 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS of the world when in what he thinks and doeshe regards and pursues nothing but gain, regardless whether this is acquired tothe detriment of his neighbour and the public. AC 7373 The two loves, the loveof self and love of the world, are what make hell with a man, for in hell thesetwo loves reign. AC 7376 It is to be known that evils are from a twofold origin;namely, from a love of self, and from a love of the world. They who are in evilsfrom the love of self, love themselves alone, and despise all others exceptthose who make one with them — in loving whom they do not love them butthemselves, because they see themselves in them. The evils from this origin arethe worst of all; for they who are in them not only despise all others incomparison with themselves, but also pursue them with invectives, and for slightcause hold them in hatred toward them, and then breathe their destruction. Inthis way revenge and cruelty become the delight of their life. Those who are inthe evil of this love are in hell at a depth according to the quality and extentof this love. But those who are in evil from the love of the world also regardtheir neighbour as of no account, and esteem him solely on account of hiswealth, thus his riches, not himself. They desire to possess all that belongs totheir neighbour, and when they are in this cupidity, they are then without allcharity and mercy; for to deprive the neighbour of his goods is the delight oftheir life, especially of those who are sordidly avaricious, that is who lovegold and silver for the sake of gold and silver, but not for the sake of any usefrom them. AC83182'3 There are two basic qualities of love, namely heavenly,spiritual love (an image of Divine Love), and its opposite hellish desire tosatisfy oneself in isolation from others. True or genuine love can reveal twofacets, love of God (the Lord) and love of the neighbour, both of which refer tothe good observed and dwelt on. When this good is thought of as centred in aperson it is termed love to the neighbour, celestial love, or charity; and whenit is thought of as from and belonging only to the Divine, it is termed love tothe Lord or spiritual love. The two facets of the opposite hellish love, arelove of the world and love of self. The love of self takes away from others androbs others of all deHght, and directs it to itself, for it wishes well toitself alone, while the love of the world wishes to have as its own the thingsbelonging to theMAN'S NATURE 47 neighbour. Therefore these loves are destructive of the delightsof others. HH 399 In these statements Swedenborg is clearly not referring to aspiritually healthy love for what is of God in oneself, the Higher Selfacknowledged as belonging only to God (see Chapter 4, p.58). He is referring tothat selfish concern for oneself as an entity apart from God, everyone andeverything, in which many negative and destructive states are harboured. Theevils belonging to those who are in the love of self are in general, contempt ofothers, envy, enmity against those by whom they are not favoured, and hostileactions on this ground; hatreds of various kinds, revenges, cunning, deceit,mercilessness, and cruelty. Where such evils exist, there is also a contempt ofthe Divine and of Divine things, namely of the goods and truths of the Church;should they honour these things it is done only with the lips and not with theheart. HD 15 How different are the qualities of love to the Lord and love to theneighbour! Love to the Lord makes man one with the Lord, that is, makes alikeness; charity or love towards the neighbour also makes him one with Him, butmakes an image. An image is not a likeness but that which approaches a likeness.AC 10133 The man who is in love to the Lord and in charity towards his neighbouris a little heaven. AC 36913 That love to the Lord and love towards theneighbour have in them all intelligence and wisdom, may appear from those who,in the world, have been in these loves. When in the other life they come intoheaven, they know and are wise in such things as they had never been beforeacquainted with; nay, like the rest of the angels, they think and speak suchthings as the ear has not heard nor the mind known, which are ineffable. AC77503 Love to the Lord is a universal love, and consequently permeateseverything in every detail. TCR 416 Although these two loves may appearindependently of each other in a person, essentially one must be within theother.48 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS Love to the Lord cannot possibly be separatedfrom love towards the neighbour, for the Lord's love is directed towards thewhole human race whom He wishes to save eternally and to join so completely toHimself that not a single one of them perishes. Anyone therefore who has love tothe Lord possesses the Lord's love and so cannot help loving the neighbour. AC2023 Love to the Lord embraces love towards the neighbour, for love to the Lordoriginates in the Lord, thus in love itself towards the whole human race.Abiding in love to the Lord is the same as abiding in the Lord, and one whoabides in the Lord must inevitably abide in His love which is directed towardsthe human race, and thus towards the neighbour AC 2221 As If It is worthsingling out this little phrase, 'as if, as one which touches the heart of themystery of man's creation and relationship to God. Through its use Swedenborg isable to throw a great light on the crux of this essential relationship. It isnot possible for the Lord to be in any angel or man unless he, in whom the Lordis with love and wisdom, perceived and felt as if they were his. By this theLord is not only received, but having been received is retained, and also lovedin return. DLW 115 Every angel has liberty and rationality. He has these two sothat he may be capable of receiving love and wisdom from the Lord yet each ofthese, liberty as much as rationality, is the Lord's with him, and not his. Butbecause these two are intimately conjoined to his life, so intimately that theymay be said to be joined into his life, therefore they appear as if they werehis own. From these he is able to think and will, also to speak and act. Andwhat he thinks, wills, speaks, and does from them, appears as if it were fromhimself. This causes reciprocity by which there is conjunction. DLW 116 The morenearly a man is conjoined to the Lord the more distinctly does he appear tohimself to be master of himself, and yet the more evidently does he recognizethat he is the Lord's. DP 42MAN'S NATURE 49 Freewill (Freedom and Rationality) That man has freedom andrationality is a basic tenet of Swedenborg's teaching. It is the foundation uponwhich man may be eventually reunited with God in love, without losing his senseof individuality. To be human in a true sense, is to be free and able to thinkand choose rationally. Everyone has what is truly human from rationality, inthat he can see and know, if he will, what is true and what is good, and alsothat he can from liberty will, think, speak, and do it. DP 2275 Herein lies thekey to how God can be in man, and yet man can be both other than God and onewith Him. Freedom makes one with life; for without freedom man could not feeland perceive that he has life as it were in himself, this being felt andperceived from freedom. For it appears to a man from freedom, that every actionof his life is his own and proper to him, freedom being the power of thinking,willing, speaking, and acting from himself, in this case, as if from himself.Together with life man was therefore endowed with freedom; it is never takenaway from him; for in the measure that it is taken away or lessened, a man feelsand perceives that he does not himself live, but another in him. AE1138} Eviland Its Origin Evil has already been described as the love of self and the loveof the world. It is a quality of life which has no independent origin, but is adistortion of the one Divine life or love as it flows through human beingsendowed with freewill. Self love does not communicate anything to others, butstifles and smothers all their delight and happiness. Whatever delight flowsinto them from others, they take to themselves, focus on themselves, andtransform into some filthy thing of their own, and prevent it spreading anyfurther. In so doing they destroy all unanimity and concord, and so bring aboutdisunity and consequently destruction. AC 2057l The love of self is called love,but viewed in itself it is hatred; for it does not love anyone outside of itselfnor does it desire to unite with others so as to benefit them, but only tobenefit itself. TCR 45 This negative form of love, centred on man's own desiresin isolation from those of others, originates from a state of awareness calledby Swedenborg Aproprium\\ and is similar to some modern uses of the term 4ego\\50 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS Propiium (Ego) Proprium is from the Latinadjective proprius, meaning 'what pertains or belongs to oneself. ForSwedenborg, proprium is the sense or awareness we have of being a separate,self-contained individual with a mind and body of our own quite apart from God,other persons, and all created things. Since this appearance, despite being sostrong, is illusory, the proprium or ego itself can be said to not really exist.By proprium no one understands anything else than that he lives from himself,and consequently thinks and wills from himself. DP 308 By * being appropriatedto man* is meant to enter his life and become part of it, consequently to becomehis own. However, it will be seen that there is nothing that is man's own: itmerely seems as if it were. DP 18 Thus when we feel only like this, we areliable to become very concerned for ourselves and our own welfare — self-centredand selfish. We become heedless of God or others, with their feelings and needs.And in this negative state we are open to all the evils that accompany it, andclosed to all that is good and true. The human proprium consists of everythingevil and false that gushes out of self love and the love of the world. Itinvolves people believing not in the Lord or in the Word, but in themselves, andtheir imagining that what they do not grasp through sensory evidence or throughfacts does not exist at all. They become as a consequence nothing but evil andfalsity and so have a warped view of everything. Things that are evil they seeas good, and those that are good as evil; things that are false they see astrue, and those that are true as false. Realities they imagine to be nothing,and things that are nothing they imagine to be everything. They call hatredlove, thick darkness light, death life, and vice versa. AC 210 Whenever manlooks to himself in the good that he does, he is let into his proprium, that is,into his inherited evils; for he then looks from good to himself. . . andtherefore he presents an image of himself in his good, and not an image of theDivine. HH 558a Since proprium in man or angel is essential for Divine Love'spurpose of union without loss of individuality, yet it so easily leads to evil,Swedenborg often uses the term 'heavenly proprium' to describe our apparentsense ofMAN'S NATURE 51 separateness which does not lead us to deny the reality of ourpermanent link with the Divine. The reason life appears as man's own is becausethe Lord from Divine Love wills to give and conjoin to man all that is his own,and as far as it can be effected, does conjoin it. This proprium which is givenby the Lord, is called the heavenly proprium. AC 8497 As regards the proprium ingeneral there are two kinds, the first being the hellish proprium, the secondthe heavenly. The hellish proprium is acquired by a person from hell, theheavenly from heaven, that is, from the Lord through heaven. AC 38121 There aretwo things that are put off by all who enter into heaven, namely, their propriumand the consequent confidence, and the merit of self or their own selfrighteousness; and they put on a heavenly proprium which is from the Lord, andthe Lord's merit or righteousness; and the more they put on these, the furtherdo they come into the interior of heaven. AC 40074 The nature of this [heavenly]proprium is that the angels perceive that they live from the Lord, and yet whennot reflecting on the matter they have no other idea than that they live fromthemselves. AC 1552 Fallacy (Illusion) As we have seen, the ego's sense ofisolation is, in fact, illusory or fallacious, being merely an appearance whichis not true in reality. A fallacy is the inversion of order; it is the judgmentof the eye rather than of the mind, the conclusion drawn from the appearance ofa thing and not from its essence. AE 1215* The things that are in the world andupon the earth appear otherwise than they are, they are full of fallacies ...for example there is the fallacy respecting the life of man, that it belongs tothe body, when yet it belongs to the spirit in the body; the fallacy that sightbelongs to the eye, hearing to the ear, and speech to the tongue and mouth, whenyet it is the spirit which sees, hears, and speaks, by means of these bodilyorgans; the fallacy that life is permanent in man, when yet it flows in; thefallacy that the soul cannot be in the human form, and have human senses andaffections; the fallacy respecting heaven52 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS and hell, that the former is above man and thelatter beneath him, when yet they are within him; the fallacy that objects flowinto the interiors, when yet what is external does not flow into what isinternal, but what is internal into what is external; the fallacy that therecould be no life after death except together with the material body. AC 6948Whatever comes from the Divine (that is from the Lord) is real, because it comesfrom the very being of things, and from essential life, but whatever comes froma spirit's proprium is unreal, because it does not come from the being ofthings, nor from essential life. AC 4623 The fallacy by which man is deceived ischiefly from this cause, that he does not know that his freedom, and faculty ofacting as if from himself, are the results of an influx of life from the Lordinto his inmost, and that this influx, because he is born a man and gifted withthat inmost, is not taken from him. AE 11483 How does the proprium affect ourunderstanding of spiritual matters? Whoever thinks from the fallacies of thesenses cannot understand, 1) that a man after death can appear as a man; andthat he is able to enjoy his senses as before; thus that angels enjoy them. Suchpersons think: 2) that the soul is only something vital, purely ethereal, ofwhich no idea can be formed; 3) that it is the body alone that feels, sees, andhears; 4) that man is like an animal, with this difference only, that he canspeak from thought; 5) that nature is all, and that it is the first from whichall things are; 6) that man is introduced into thought and learns how to thinkby an influx of interior nature and its order; 7) that the spiritual does notexist, and if it does, that it is of a more pure nature; 8) that man cannotenjoy any happiness, if divested of the delights of the love of glory, honour,or gain; 9) that conscience is only a disease of the mind, originating frominfirmity of the body, and from non-successes; 10) that the Divine Love of theLord is the love of glory; 11) that there is no Providence, but that all thingsflow from self- prudence and self-intelligence;MAN'S NATURE 53 12) that honours and riches are real blessings, which arebestowed by God; not to mention many other similar things. HD 53 Man has thegift of a natural faculty that enables him to reason. Even this ability can besubject to the fallacies of the senses. The human rational — that is to say therational formed from images of worldly things received through the senses, andlater on from images of things analagous to actual worldly wants, such as arereceived from factual knowledge and from cognitions — virtually laughs or mocksif it is told that it does not live of itself but only appears of itself to doso. It likewise laughs if it is told that the less anyone believes that he livesof himself, the more he is truly living, that is the more wise and intelligenthe is, and the more blessed and happy. And it also laughs if it is told thatlife is the life which angels possess, especially those who are celestial andare inmost or nearest to the Lord; for these know that nobody except Jehovahalone, that is, the Lord, lives of Himself. This rational would mock if it weretold that it has nothing of its own, and that its possessing anything of its ownis an illusion or an appearance. Still more would it mock if it were told thatthe more it is subject to the illusion that it possesses anything of its own theless it in fact possesses, and vice versa. It would likewise mock if it weretold that whatever it thinks and does from what is its own is evil, even thoughit was good [in its effect], and if it were told that it has no wisdom until itbelieves and perceives that all evil comes from hell and all good from the Lord.This is a conviction, indeed a perception, that exists in all angels, yet theypossess selfhood or a proprium in fuller measure than all others. But theyrealize and perceive that their selfhood comes from the Lord, even though itseems to be completely their own. This rational would again mock if it were toldthat in heaven the greatest are those who are least; that the wisest are thosethat believe and perceive that they themselves are the least wise; that thehappiest are those who wish the greatest happiness to others and the least tothemselves; that heaven consists in wishing to be below everyone else, but hellin wishing to be above everyone else; and that consequently the glory of heavendoes not hold within it anything at all of that which the glory of the worldholds.54 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS This rational would similarly mock if it weretold that in the next life space and time do not exist at all but states inaccordance with which there are appearances of space and time, and that lifebecomes more heavenly the further removed it is from the things that belong tospace and time and the closer it comes to that which is eternal — for that whichis eternal has absolutely nothing within it that is received from the notion oftime or anything analogous to it. AC 2654yh Falsity The belief that one isseparate from God is in fact false. Hence out of fallacy the state of falsityarises. All the fallacies that hold sway with the evil and the simple arise fromappearances confirmed. So long as appearances remain appearances, they areapparent truths according to which everyone can think and speak. But when theyare accepted for the truths themselves, as happens when they are confirmed, thenapparent truths become falsities and fallacies. DLW 108 Guilt The decision tobelieve in the appearance of one's separateness, thus moving away from one'sSource, from God, begets a feeling of guilt and shame, or painfulselfconsciousness. Everyone becomes guilty, however, who believes that he isdoing everything from himself, whether it is good or evil, but he who believeshe is doing it as from himself does not become guilty. AR 22410 If a man wouldbelieve as the case really is, namely, that all that is good and true is fromthe Lord, and all evil and falsity is from hell, he then could not become guiltyof any fault, nor could evil be imputed to him; but because he believes that itis from himself, he appropriates evil to himself, for this is the effect of hisfaith; and in this way evil adheres and cannot be separated from him. AC 6324Fear Guilt begets fear — the fear of loneliness and punishment by the Source, orof God now externalized or removed from one's centre so as to appear to standthreateningly over against one. Those who are in evil fear lest anything theythink and will shouldMAN'S NATURE 55 show itself, for they intend nothing but evil toward theneighbour. AC 6655 Fear is indeed a bond common both to those who are welldisposed and to those who are evil; but with those who are well disposed it isan internal fear, which is on account of salavation, that is to say, lest theyshould perish as to their souls, and, therefore, lest they should do anythingcontrary to conscience, that is, contrary to truth and good, which belong to theconscience; they have consequently a fear of doing anything contrary to what isjust and fair, thus contrary to the neighbour: but this fear becomes a holy fearin proportion as it is conjoined with the affection of charity, and still moreas it is conjoined with love to the Lord. The fear then becomes such as that oflittle children towards the parents whom they love; and then in proportion asthey are in the good of love, it does not appear as fear, but in proportion asthey are not in good it does so appear, and becomes anxiety. Such is the fear ofGod, so frequently spoken of in the Word. But with those who are evil, there isnot any internal fear, that is to say, on account of salvation, and therefore ofconscience, for they have entirely rejected such fear in the world, both bytheir life and by their principles of falsity that favoured their life; butinstead of internal they have external fear, that is to say, fear lest theyshould be deprived of honours, of gain, of reputation on account of these, ofbeing punished according to the laws, or of being deprived of life. Those whoare in evil have fear on these accounts, while they are in the world. When theycome into the other life, as they cannot be restrained and kept in bonds byinternal fears, they are by external fear, which is impressed on them bypunishments. From these they have the fear of doing evil; and at length theyhave fear of the Divine, but, as has been said, an external fear, which iswithout any will of desisting from doing evil, from an affection of good, butfrom a terror of punishments, which they at last dread. AC 72801,2 Butspiritually, fear is useless. Fear does not effect anything. SD 2899 There is,however, a heavenly or holy form of fear which is part of heavenly love, and notto be confused with the proprium's fear. The holy fear which is signified by thefear of God ... is love, but56 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS such love as little children have towardstheir parents, parents towards their children, and married partners towards eachother, who fear to do anything which displeases, thus which in any way injuresthe love. AC 8925 Hell Delusion, self-centredness, falsity, pride, guilt, andfear are some of the states that together constitute the basis for the generalcondition called hell. The loves of self and of the world constitute hell withman. AC 7366 Man's proprium is his hell itself; for through his voluntaryproprium he communicates with hell, which is such that it desires nothing morethan to precipitate itself into hell. AC 1049 Hell is to will to be above all.AC 26545 The will of evil, and the understanding of falsity ... are hell withman. AC 10064 Heaven 'The kingdom of heaven is within.' Heaven, too, is an innerstate — but how different! Heaven, that is, angelic life, lies in everythingblessed and happy and also from the fact that its influence is felt from thingsthat are inmost, since it flows in from the Lord by way of inmost things. At thesame time wisdom and intelligence enter in and fill the inner recesses of themind itself, kindling good with heavenly flame and truth with heavenly light.And this is accompanied by a perception of blessing and happiness which can onlybe called indescribable. AC 23632 A man enters heaven and becomes a Church, whenhe is in good, because the Lord flows in into the good in man, and by means ofgood into his truth. The influx passes into the internal man, where his heavenis, and through the internal into the external where his world is. . . Andbecause heaven is in the internal man, therefore when this is opened a man is inheaven, for heaven is not in a place, but is interiorly in man. AC 10361 A manwhose moral life is spiritual has heaven within himself, but he whose moral lifeis merely natural does not have heaven withinMAN'S NATURE 57 himself; and for the reason that heaven flows in from above andopens man's interiors, and through his interiors flows into his exteriors. . .And yet heaven is not the same in one as in another. It differs in each one inaccordance with his affection for good and thence for truth. HH 3192 Heaven is acommunion for it communicates all it has with each one, and each one receivesall he has from that communion. An angel is a receptacle, and, by virtue ofthis, a heaven in least form ... a man, too, so far as he receives heaven, isalso a receptacle, a heaven and an angel. HH 13 Swedenborg never tires ofstressing the potentiality of man's angelhood. A man of the Church is an angelin respect of the interiors which are of his mind. DLW 118 A man in whom is theChurch, equally with an angel, is a heaven . . . consequently, he who has goodfrom the Lord is an angel-man. It may be mentioned what a man has in common withan angel and what he has in addition to what angels have. A man has this incommon with an angel, that his interiors are equally conformed to the image ofheaven and that he, too, in so far as he is in the good of love and faith, maybecome an image of heaven. In addition to what angels have, a man has thesethings, that his exteriors have been formed according to the image of the world,that so far as he is in good, the world with him is subordinated to heaven andserves heaven, and that then the Lord is present with him in both worlds, justas if he were in his heaven. HH 51 The Lord's heaven in the natural world iscalled the Church; and an angel of this heaven is a man of the Church who isconjoined to the Lord; and after he leaves this world he becomes an angel of thespiritual heaven. DP 304 THE DIVINE IN MAN We have seen how Swedenborg has emphasized that man's naturemust be such that he has constantly the Divine within him as his creativeSource. What effect does this have on man? If God were not present in all partsand at all times in the human mind, it would dissolve like a bubble in the air,and both divisions of the brain, in which it acts from first principles wouldmelt away like froth. TCR 302 Since man was created a form of Divine Order, Godis in him; but so far as a man lives according to Divine Order, God is fully inhim. If however, he does not live according to Divine Order, God is still inhim, but in the highest regions of his soul, affording him the power tounderstand what is true and to will what is good, that is, the ability tounderstand and the inclination to love. But so far as a man lives contrary toorder, he closes the lower regions of his mind or spirit, and prevents God fromcoming down and filling those lower regions with His presence; thus God is inhim, but he is not in God. It is a general law in heaven that God is in everyman, evil as well as good, but that a man is not in God unless he livesaccording to Order. TCR 70 With every single angel and also with every singleman, there is an inmost or highest degree or an inmost or highest something intowhich the Divine of the Lord first or most closely inflows, and from which Itdisposes the other interior things which succeed in accordance with the degreesof order within them. This inmost or highest degree may be called the entranceof the Lord to the angel and to the man, and His very own dwelling place withthem . . . Also it is by reason of this that man lives to eternity. But what isarranged and providedTHE DIVINE IN MAN 59 by the Lord in this inmost does not openly inflow into theperception of any angel, because it is above his thought and transcends hiswisdom. HH 39 Swedenborg describes man as having no life-in-himself. In thissense he has in reality no self of his own — only the appearance of one. OnlyGod really has Self, as an independent Source of Life. God is the Self, the onlyOne and the First, called Being and existing in Itself, the Source of all thingswhich are and which exist ... He has also revealed in the Word that He is the IAm or Being, the Self and the only One which is in Itself, and thus, theBeginning the Source of all things. TCR 22 Inner Source as a Sun It is this Selfor Source within man which is sometimes described today as the Divine within —shared with all other beings (called Atman in Hindu philosophy). When in thespiritual world one's eyes are opened to become aware of the Divine within, Itappears like a sun in the spiritual sky. This Self, which is the Divine being,is not in place but is with those and in those who are in place according totheir reception of Him . . . but because He cannot be received by anyone as Heis in Himself, He appears as He is in His Essence, that is as a sun above theangelic heavens. TCR 253'4 The Lord is the Sun of the angelic heaven, and thisSun appears before the eyes of angels when they are in spiritual meditation. Thesame thing happens with a man in this world, in whom the Church abides, as tothe sight of his spirit. TCR 767 The rays of this spiritual Sun are love andtruth corresponding to the heat and light of natural suns. The Sun which in theother life gives light to the angels and to the universal heaven, is the Lord,and the fire there is His Divine Love, which gives the heat of life to everyliving thing, and the light there is the Divine Truth which enlightens all whoreceive it. . . the heat and light which come forth from the Sun of heaven, aretherefore called spiritual, because they have life in them. The life which isperceived in living things in heat and from heat, is not from the heat of thesun of the world, but is from the heat of the Sun of heaven,60 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS When this heat flows into the heat of theworld it produces that effect, and is felt in the body as elementary heat; butthere is in it vital heat which derives its origin from the love which is theheat from the Sun of heaven. AC 8812 The reason why that Sun appears before theangels' eyes as fiery is that love and fire correspond to one another; for theireyes cannot see love but, in place of it, that which corresponds to it. . . theDivine Love is even felt as fire by the spiritual. DLW 81 Above the angelicheaven is a Sun which is pure love, in appearance fiery like the sun of theworld; from the heat proceeding from that Sun, angels and men have will andlove, and from the light, understanding, and wisdom; and the things belonging tolife are called spiritual, while those which proceed from the sun of the worldare vessels of life and are called natural; and furthermore the expanse of thecentre of life is called the Spiritual World which subsists from its own Sun,and the expanse of nature is called the Natural World which subsists from itsown sun. CL 380u The Divine Love glows within so strongly that some degree ofshielding is always necessary. The Lord as a Sun does not flow immediately intothe heavens, but the ardour of His love is tempered by degrees on the way. Thesetemperings appear as radiating belts around the Sun. And in addition, the angelsare veiled with a suitably thin cloud to prevent their being harmed by theinflux. HH 120 The Lord from the Sun of the spiritual world flows in with thesame heat and light into the souls and minds of men. This heat in its essence isHis Divine Love, and this light in its essence is His Divine Wisdom; and theLord adapts this light and heat to the capacity and nature of the recipientangel and man. This is effected by means of spiritual airs or atmospheres whichconvey and transmit them. The Divine Itself which immediately encompasses theLord constitutes that Sun. It is distant from the angels as the sun of thenatural world is from men; for otherwise they also would be consumed. TCR 6412Swedenborg does not mean that the Lord or the Divine, actually is that Sun, forthat sun itself is only an appearance or correspondence of the Divine Itself. Sohe warns:THE DIVINE IN MAN 61 Let everyone beware of thinking that the Sun of thespiritual world is God Himself. God Himself is Man. The first proceeding fromHis Love and Wisdom is a fiery spiritual thing which appears before the angelsas a sun. Wherefore when the Lord manifests Himself to the angels in person, Hemanifests Himself as Man, and this sometimes in the Sun, sometimes outside it.DLW 97 The Two Worlds The two suns, spiritual and natural, are the heart andcentre of two worlds, the world of the inner man, and the world of the outerman. There is an internal man and an external man, and the internal man is inthe spiritual world, and the external man in the natural world; thus the formeris in the light of heaven, and the latter in the light of the world. AC 6055 Theinternal man is formed according to the image of heaven, and the external manaccording to the image of the world, because the internal man is a heaven in theleast form, and the external man is a world in the least form, thus a microcosm.In man the spiritual world is conjoined with the natural world so that with himthe spiritual world flows into the natural world in so vivid a manner that hemay notice it provided he pays attention. AC 6057 Enlightenment It follows thatall man's enlightenment to spiritual truth and wisdom comes from the spiritualSun (or Higher Self) which is within, and is a kind of internal sight.Enlightening is effected by the light of heaven which is from the Lord as theSun there . . . when the understanding is enlightened by that Divine light, itthen perceives that to be true which is true, it acknowledges it inwardly initself, and as it were sees it. Such is the revelation of those who are in theaffection of truth from good when they read the Word. AC 87807 The light ofheaven enlightens the understanding; for that light is the Divine Truth whichproceeds from the Lord as a sun, and the heat of heaven enkindles the will, forthat heat is the good of love which also proceeds from the Lord as a sun. Sincea man is then among62 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS the angels, the understanding of truth and theaffection for good are communicated to him by them, that is through them by theLord. AC 103302 Those who are enlightened when they read the Word, see it fromwithin, for their internal is open and the internal when open, is in the lightof heaven. This light flows in and enlightens although a man is unaware of it;and this is the case because that light flows in into the knowledges that are inman's memory, and those knowledges are a natural light; and because a man thinkson these as from himself, he cannot perceive the influx; nevertheless fromvarious indications he may know that he has been enlightened. AC 1055125. NATURE OF DIVINE MANIFESTATION The Divine in itself is invisible, yet it isthe very nature of Its being to create, manifesting Itself, as an artist does,through what It creates. So, paradoxically, the Divine can be discerned or'seen* through created forms. How then can we recognize it? Swedenborg's answercan be found in what he called in his earlier physiological period, his'Doctrine of Series, Degrees, and Correspondences \\ Correspondence — MirrorEffect in Nature The science of correspondences is one of Swedenborg's mostdeveloped and applied insights, and is central to all his work. Through it heshows how appearances, qualities, and functions of finite created formscorrespond to man's spiritual thought, feelings, and affections, which in turnreflect aspects of the Divine. The things that are in the spiritual world can beseen as in a mirror from those that come into existence in the natural world. HH56 Often when I have been in gardens and have been looking at the trees, fruits,flowers, and vegetables there, I have observed their correspondences in heaven,and have spoken with those in whom these were, and have been taught whence andwhat they were. HH 109 All things are full of God, and everyone takes hisportion from that fullness. TCR 364* The Doctrine or Law of Correspondence (inconjunction with the 'Doctrine of Discrete Degrees', next section), arising outof his earlier philosophical period, is a key element in all Swedenborg'steaching. However, whereas before the onset of his spiritual experiences hisunderstanding of this area was very general and hazy, in his mature spiritualphase he was able to specify and give the rationale for very many specificcorrespondences64 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS between the different levels of Reality —Divine, heavenly, psychospiritual and material. In general a garden correspondsto heaven as to intelligence and wisdom, so that heaven is called the garden ofGod and paradise, and by man the heavenly paradise. Trees according to theirspecies correspond to the perceptions and cognitions of good and truth fromwhich intelligence and wisdom come. HH 111 The living creatures of the earth, ingeneral, correspond to affections ... In particular cattle and their youngcorrespond to the affections of the natural mind, sheep and lambs to theaffections of the spiritual mind, while winged creatures according to theirspecies, correspond to the intellectual things of either mind. HH 110 Thiscorrespondence is to be found in the function or use served by the particularform on the different levels. The universe has been so created and formed by theDivine that uses may be everywhere clothed in such a way as to be presented inact or in effect, first in heaven and afterwards in the world, thus by degreesand successively down to the ultimates of nature. Hence it is evident that thecorrespondence of natural things with spiritual things, or of the world withheaven, is through uses, and that uses conjoin. And the forms in which uses areclothed are correspondences and means of conjunction. HH 112 The law ofcorrespondence applies universally to all created forms, linking them everyinstant to the corresponding form on the next higher level from which theyreceive their existence. All things that come into existence in nature from theleast to the greatest are correspondences. They are correspondences because thenatural world with all things belonging to it comes into existence and continuesin existence from the spiritual world, and both worlds from the Divine, HH 106Not all created forms are pure or 'good* however, since hellish distortions ofspirit, introduced by man in his freedom, exist at the spiritual level, and giverise to corresponding evil forms. Gentle and useful creatures [correspond] togood affections, fierce and useless ones [correspond] to evil affections. HH 110.NATURE OF DIVINE MANIFESTATION 65 Moles and bats correspond to those who are indarkness, that is, in falsities and thence in evils. AC 8932* Today we have lostthe instinctive ability that man in the Golden Age had, to instantaneouslyperceive the spiritual and the Divine within the natural forms of one'senvironment. But originally, in that Age, mankind had no difficulty inperceiving the spiritual world, or world of the spirit, that lies within theforms of nature. To the members of the most ancient church earthly and worldlyobjects of the external senses were as nothing. They did not perceive anydelight in those objects, only in the things which they meant and represented.Consequently when they looked at earthly objects they thought not at all of theobjects, but only of the things they meant and represented, which to them weremost delightful, for they were such things as exist in heaven, from which theybehold the Lord Himself. AC 1122 As they were celestial, and had fellowship withangels, all things that they saw or apprehended by any of the senses, were tothem representative and significative of the celestial and spiritual things thatare in the Lord's kingdom; so that they did indeed see worldly and terrestrialthings with their eyes, or apprehend them by their other senses, but from themand by means of them they thought of celestial and spiritual things, AC 2896 Inthe life after death the environment seen by an angel or spirit with his eyes isa very accurate reflection of the current state of his inner spiritual world. •And since the Divine is within him an angel may recognize part of himself inwhat he sees around him. In the spiritual world are all the things of the threekingdoms, and in the midst of them is the angel. He sees those around him and healso knows that they are his representations. Indeed when the inmost of hisunderstanding is opened, he recognizes himself and sees in them his image,practically in no other way than as in a mirror. DLW 63 Discrete DegreesCorrespondence is always between different levels or orders of reality whichSwedenborg strongly emphasizes, are discretely different. It is impossible toprogress gradually from one level to another as with continuous degrees66 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS like temperature or height. No amount oflearning in itself, for example, will make one more intelligent or wise, and noamount of spiritual insight will in itself make one more loving. And yet,despite their utter distinctness, forms on the higher level exist withincorresponding forms on the lower level, as their spiritual cause or origin. Aknowledge of degrees is like a key for opening the causes of things and forentering into them. Without that knowledge scarcely anything of cause can beknown. For without it the objects and subjects of both worlds appear so simpleas though there were nothing in them beyond that which meets the eye, when yetthe things that appear are as one to thousands, indeed, to myriads, comparedwith the things which lie hidden within. The interiors which do not he open canby no means be disclosed except by a knowledge of degrees. For exterior thingsgo on to interior things and through these to inmost things by means of degrees,not by continuous degrees but by discrete degrees . . . these degrees are calleddiscrete, because the prior is by itself, the posterior by itself and the finalby itself, but yet taken together they make one. DLW 184 How important thisawareness of spiritual levels was to Swedenborg can be gauged from hissubsequent paragraph. Without a knowledge of these degrees nothing can be knownabout the difference between the three heavens, nor about the difference betweenthe love and wisdom of the angels there, nor between the heat and light in whichthey are, nor about the difference between the atmospheres which surround andcontain them. Again without a knowledge of these degrees, nothing can be knownabout the differences among the interior faculties belonging to the minds ofmen* and so nothing about their state as to reformation and regeneration, northe differences of the exterior faculties belonging to the body, in the case ofangels as well as men. And certainly nothing can be known about the differencebetween the spiritual and the natural, and thus nothing about correspondence.Indeed nothing can be known of any difference of life between men and beasts,nor of the difference between the more perfect and less perfect beasts, nor yetabout the differences among forms of the vegetable kingdom, * See Appendix:'Discrete Degrees in Man'.NATURE OF DIVINE MANIFESTATION 67 and matters of the mineral kingdom. From whichit can be established that those who have no knowledge of these degrees cannotfrom any judgment see causes. They only see effects and judge causes from these,and this is done for the most part from induction which is continuous witheffects, when yet causes produce effects not continuously but discretely. DLW185Man as Microcosm and the Universal Human (Grand Man) Man contains within himselfpotentially all of heaven and hell — namely the whole spiritual world. The outerform we call the physical body is a little world, corresponding to and somirroring his greater inner world. The internal man is formed according to theimage of heaven, and the external man according to the image of the world,because the internal man is a heaven in the least form, and the external man isa world in the least form, thus a microcosm. AC 6051 Man was called a microcosmby the ancients from the fact that he represents the macrocosm which is theuniverse in its whole complex. The ancients called man a microcosm, or littleuniverse, and this they derived from the knowledge of correspondences in whichthe most ancient people were, and from communication with the angels of heaven.DLW 319 The higher or spiritual region of the human mind is also a heaven inminiature, and the lower or natural region is a world in miniature. This is thereason why man was called by the ancients a microcosm, or little world; he mayalso be called a micro-uranus, or little heaven. TCR 604 Man's inner heavenlyworld, which he can only ever enter partially, is the greater Whole whichSwedenborg termed the 'Grand Man'. Since this Great Form is timeless andspaceless, It is universal and hence may be termed, the Universal Human. It isin fact the Divine Human (see Chapter 2) or Divine Body of which man is anintegral part. Sacred Scripture as the Word Aspects of Divinity, manifestvisibly through created forms. But through prophecies and the writings of sacredscripture (the Word) the Divine also manifests verbally. God adapts the mode ofrevelation to the general spiritual condition of mankind at the time.68 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS I have heard from heaven that with the mostancient people on this earth there was immediate revelation, and that thereforethey had no written Word; but after their times, when immediate revelation couldneither be given nor received without danger to their souls ... it pleased theLord to reveal Divine Truth by a Word which was written solely bycorrespondences; which comprehends within itself the wisdom of the angels of thethree heavens. This wisdom does not appear in our Word, but yet it is within it,and how it is within it shall be briefly told. There are three heavens, onebeneath another, and under them the world. In the highest heaven angelic wisdomis in the highest degree, which is called celestial wisdom; in the middle heavenis angelic wisdom in the middle degree, which is called spiritual wisdom; but inthe lowest heaven is angelic wisdom in the lowest degree, which is calledspiritual-and-celestial-natural. In the world, because that is below theheavens, is wisdom in the lowest degree, which is called natural. All thesedegrees of wisdom are in the Word which is in the world, but in simultaneousorder, for successive order in its descent becomes simultaneous. Such asimultaneity is the Word in the world: in its inmost is the Lord as a Sun, fromwhich Divine Truth and Divine Good, light and flame, radiate and descend throughmediates even to ultimates. Next in that simultaneity is the celestial such asin the highest or third heaven, from which the angels there have wisdom. Thenfollows the Divine spiritual, such as is in the middle or second heaven, fromwhich the angels there have wisdom. After that succeeds the Divine spiritualnatural, and celestial natural, such as is in the ultimate or first heaven, fromwhich the angels there have wisdom. The ultimate circumference of thissimultaneity constitutes the Divine natural, such as is in the world, from whichmen have wisdom. This ultimate girds about, binds together, and thus containsthe interiors, that they may not flow away; thus it serves also as a support.Such is our Word in the sense of the letter, in general and also in every part.DV 21 The Lord always provides from His Divine that among the human race thereshall be a Church in which is revealed truth Divine, which in our earth is theWord; through this there is a continuous connection between the human race andthe heavens. Hence it is that in each singleNATURE OF DIVINE MANIFESTATION 69 thing of the Word there is an internal sense,which is for heaven; and which is circumstanced in such a manner as to conjoinangelic minds with human minds by so close a bond, that they act as one. AC92163 While Swedenborg himself found this Word within the greater part of theBible, he also acknowledged a prior more universal record, since lost in itsoriginal form, which he called the Ancient Word. There was a Word with theancients, written, like our Word, by correspondences alone, but this has beenlost as has been told me by angels of the third heaven. They said also that thisWord is still preserved with them, and is in use among the ancients in thatheaven, whose Word it was when they were in the world. Those ancients with whomthat Word is still in use in the heavens, were in part from the land of Canaanand its borders, and also from certain kingdoms in Asia, Syria, Mesopotamia,Arabia, Chaldea, Assyria, Egypt, Tyre, and Sidon . . . That Word was full ofsuch correspondences as signified heavenly things remotely, and for that reasonin the course of time began to be falsified by many, therefore of the Lord'sDivine Providence it gradually died out, and another Word was given which waswritten by correspondences less remote, and this through the prophets with thesons of Israel. In this Word, nevertheless the names of places in the land ofCanaan and in Asia round about were retained and kept their signification. DV 36The religions of many nations have been derived from that Ancient Word andcarried elsewhere, as from the land of Canaan and from various parts of Asiainto Greece and thence into Italy, and through Ethiopia and Egypt into certainkingdoms of Africa. In Greece, however, out of correspondences they made fables,and out of the Divine attributes so many gods, the greatest of whom they calledJove, from Jehovah. DV 38 I was informed that the first seven chapters ofGenesis are extant in that Ancient Word, and that not the least word is wanting.DSS103 Indeed it was through meditation on the Word (the Bible) that Swedenborgclaimed to receive all his spiritual enlightenment, whereas his spiritualknowledge came to him through things heard and seen in the spiritual world. Ihave had conversation with spirits and angels for many years now;ZQ SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS and no spirit has dared, nor has any angelwished, to tell me anything, still less to instruct me, about what is in theWord, or about any matter of doctrine from the Word. I have been taught by theLord alone, who was revealed to me, and who has since constantly appeared beforemy eyes as the Sun in which He is; and he appears in the same way as He appearsto the angels, and He has enlightened me. DP 135 The Lord leads those who loveand will truths from Himself. These are enlightened when they read the Word, forthe Lord is present in it, and speaks with everyone according to his capacity.If these hear the speech of spirits, as is sometimes the case, they are nottaught by it, but are led, so providentially, that the man is still left [infreedom] to himself. AE 1183 As for myself, I have not been allowed to takeanything from the mouth of any spirit nor from the mouth of any angel, but fromthe mouth of the Lord alone. DV 29 By this he means he took nothing on trustfrom any angel or spirit, but relied solely on his Inner Teacher, the Lord. Thewritten Word as Divine manifestation is necessarily written throughout in verbalcorrespondences which form the basis for its genuine spiritual sense or import.Since the Word interiorily is spiritual and celestial, it is therefore writtenby means of pure correspondences; and what is thus written is in its ultimatesense written in such a style as is seen in the prophets and evangelists which,although it appears ordinary, yet has stored up within it Divine wisdom and allangelic wisdom. DSS 8 Correspondences, by which the Word, as to each and allthings of it, has been written, possess such force and strength that it may becalled the force and strength of Divine omnipotence; for through thesecorrespondences the natural acts conjointly with the spiritual, and thespiritual with the natural, thus everything of heaven with everything of theworld. Iw 45 There are three discrete levels of understanding or perceivingtruth in the Word. Because there is a trine in every particular of the Word onewithin the other, and this trine is like that of effect, cause and end, itfollowsNATURE OF DIVINE MANIFESTATION Zl that there are three senses in the Word, onewithin the other — a natural, a spiritual, and a celestial; a natural for theworld, a spiritual for the heavens and the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and acelestial for the heavens of His celestial kingdom. AE 10832 The Word rightlyused, is a powerful medium for bringing into unison the different levels withinthe spirit. When the Word is read on earth, the angels in heaven are affected bythe holiness that is in the internal sense. This is effected by means of thecorrespondences of the single things therein. AC 86153 As it is from creationthat the end, cause, and effect should together make one; so also it is fromcreation that the heavens should make one with the Church on the earth, butthrough the Word, while it is read by man from the love of truth and good. Forthis is the end for which the Word was given by the Lord, in order that theremight be a perpetual conjunction of the angels of heaven with the men of theearth; and also perpetual communication according to conjunction . . . Theconjunction and communication is instantaneous. The reason for this is, that allthings of the Word in its literal sense are like effects, in which the cause andthe end are together; and the effects, which are in the Word, are called uses,the causes thereof truths, and the ends goods. And the Divine Love, which is theLord, unites together these three in the man who is in the affection of usesfrom the Word. AE10842 The greatest power dwells in correspondences . . .because in them heaven and the world, or the spiritual and the natural, aretogether . . . wherefore by the Word there is conjunction of man with heaven,and thus with the Lord. Inv 59 Divine Manifestation in the Form of a Person TheDivine is seen by angels as a sun in the sky. However He can and often does,manifest Himself in a personal form as an angel. When however the Lord appearsin heaven, which often happens, He does not appear encompassed with a sun, butin angelic form, yet distinguished from angels by the Divine shining from Hisface ... I have also seen the Lord on high, outside the Sun in an angelic form alittle below the Sun, also nearby in a similar form with shining72 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS face, also once in the midst of angels as aflamelike brightness. HH121 When the Lord appears in any society He appearsthere as an angel, but He is distinguished from others by the Divine whichshines through. HH 55 The Lord appears in a Divine angelic form which is humanto those who acknowledge and believe in a visible Divine, but not to thos ■ whobelieve in an invisible one. HH 19 There is nothing fixed or definite about howthe Lord appears, however. The Lord appears to everyone according to the qualityof him who receives. AC 3235 Before the coming of Jesus Christ the way Godmanifested Himself to man on earth was in some angelic form. When Jehovahappeared before the coming of the Lord into the world, He appeared in the formof an angel; for when He passed through heaven, He clothed himself with thatform, which is the human form. For the whole heaven by virtue of the Divinethere, is like one Man. AC 10519\" Divine Incarnation Divine manifestationthrough the intermediary of angelic forms served their purpose only as long asman could benefit from such visions. But when mankind as a whole fell into sucha state of spiritual darkness, as it did 2000 years ago, it became necessary forGod Himself to reach man in a more direct way. He adopted the human essenceitself by being born. He did so in order that the infinite Divine could bejoined to man even though man was so remote. AC 19901 This had to take placeaccording to the order which is the mark of Divine Love and Wisdom. In order forGod to continually reach man He has to have contact with and indeed experiencethe causes of man's weakness; and so birth through a human mother was necessaryto provide the 'infirm human*. Let it be said simply that He was like any otherhuman being, exceptNATURE OF DIVINE MANIFESTATION 11 that He was conceived from Jehovah, yet bornof a woman who was a virgin, and that by birth from that virgin He took on allthe weaknesses that are common to all . . . AC 1414 But with God as the Fatherthis child at soul level was the Divine Itself, unlike offspring of humanparents. The Lord's Being, and hence the inmost of His life, was Divine, becauseit was Jehovah Himself; and the clothings or exteriors composed the human whichHe took from the mother by birth. This human was such that it could be tempted,for it was polluted with hereditary evil from the mother; but because the inmostwas Divine, He was able by His own power to cast out that evil heredity from themother. AC 5041 Since God came down, and since He is Order itself, it wasnecessary in order for Him actually to become man, that He should be conceived,and carried in the womb, and be born; and that He should be educated, acquiringin due course the knowledge by which He might attain to intelligence and wisdom.Therefore as to His humanity He was an infant like any other infant, a boy likeany other boy and so on; but with this difference, that He passed through thoseprogressive states sooner, more fully and more perfectly than others. TCR 89 Tosome it may come as a surprise to say that hereditary evil from the mother waspresent with the Lord ... the Lord was in this sense born as any other and hadweaknesses as any other has them. That the Lord derived hereditary evil from themother is quite clear from the fact that He underwent temptations. Nobody canever be tempted who has no evil, for it is the evil present with a man thattempts and by means of which he is tempted. That the Lord was tempted,undergoing temptations so serious that no other could ever endure oneten-thousandth part of them, that He suffered all alone, and by His own powerovercame evil, or the devil and the whole of hell, is also clear . . . that theLord bore the iniquities and evils of the human race is also a statementcommonly made by preachers, yet the diversion of iniquities and of evils toHimself can never come about except by a hereditary channel. The Divine cannottake evil upon Itself, and therefore in order that He might overcome evil by Hisown powers — which no human being has ever been able to do or ever can do1A SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS — and in so doing might make Himself alonerighteousness, He was willing to be born like any other. Otherwise there wouldhave been no need for Him to be born at all, for the Lord could have assumedhuman essence without going through the process of birth, as he had indeedsometimes done when seen by members of the most ancient church, and also byprophets. Therefore in order that He might be furnished with evil against whichHe was to fight and over which He was to conquer, and in so doing might jointogether in Himself the Divine essence to the human essence He came into theworld. In the Lord however there was no evil of His own, that is, He committedno actual evil. AC 15133'4 •7'8 A battle royal now ensues within the mind ofJesus, as he grows from infancy and boyhood, to enter on His life's mission. Hisinner spiritual awareness (the perfect Divine Human) reveals to Him the truenature of his situation and purpose in life. On the other hand His merelynatural mind (subject to the illusions of proprium and closer to His physicalsenses) casts all kinds of doubt on these inner perceptions. Within Jesus* mind,God and the 'devil' (i.e. personified hell or proprium) do battle for supremacy:to reject the one is to unite with the other. All temptation is an attackagainst the love present in a person, the degree of temptation depending on thedegree of that love. If love is not attacked there is no temptation. Destroyinganother person's love is destroying his very life, for his life is his love. TheLord's life was love to the whole human race; indeed it was so great and of sucha nature as to be nothing other than pure love. Against this life of His,temptations were directed constantly, and this was happening . . . from earliestchildhood through to His last hour in the world . . . The hells were constantlyoverpowered, subdued, and vanquished by Him; and this He did solely out of lovetowards the whole human race. And because this love was not human but Divine,and because the intensity of the love determines that of the temptation, itbecomes clear how severe His conflicts were, and on the part of the hells howmore fierce. AC 16903'6 Temptation combat or testing is a situation of freechoice in the soul of man — between heaven and hell within. Rejecting of the oneis the uniting with the other. So with Jesus, in choosing the reality of Hishigher Self, He rejected the fallacious appearances and negative states of Hismerely natural mind, subordinating its thoughts and feelings to the higher onesfrom above.NATURE OF DIVINE MANIFESTATION 75 This process, whereby the natural mind ofJesus became united to the Divine Human mind within, Swedenborg callsglorification, or 'the making Divine of the human in the Lord'. It is well knownfrom the Word, in the Gospels, that the Lord adored and prayed to Jehovah, HisFather, and that He did so as though to someone other than Himself, even thoughJehovah was within Him. But the state that the Lord experienced at such timeswas the state of His humiliation . . .[when] He was in the infirm human derivedfrom the mother. But to the extent He cast this off and took on the Divine Hisstate was different, which state is called the state of His glorification. Inthe first state He adored Jehovah as someone other than Himself, even though Hewas within Him, for, as has been stated, his internal was Jehovah. In the latterstate however, that is to say, the state of glorification, He spoke to Jehovahas to Himself, since He was Jehovah Himself. AC 19992 As regards the Lord's lifeitself, it was a life in which the human was constantly advancing towards theDivine, even to complete union. AC 25232 Right to the end of His life when Hewas glorified the Lord gradually and constantly separated from Himself and castoff that which was merely human. That is to say, He cast off that which He hadderived from the mother, until ultimately He was no longer her son but the Sonof God not only in conception but also in birth, and so was one with the Fatherand was Jehovah Himself. AC 26492 The Lord was also in the appearances of truthwhen in the maternal human, but that, as He put off this human, He put off thoseappearances also, and put on the Infinite and Eternal Divine Itself. AC 3405 TheLord, when He glorified His human, put off everything derived from the mother,and put on everything belonging to the Father. TCR 94 The Lord chose to be born. . . within a Church which, on account of self love and love of the world, hadsunk completely into a hellish and devilish proprium. He did so in order thatfrom His own Divine power He might within His own human essence unite the Divinecelestial proprium to the human proprium, so that they became one withinHimself. AC 256Z6 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS Thus was fulfilled what had been foreseen andprophesied from man's earliest time. The most ancient church . . . adored theInfinite Manifestation in which is the Infinite as Being. The InfiniteManifestation, in which is the Infinite as Being, they perceived as a DivineMan, because they knew that the Infinite Manifestation came forth through heavenfrom the Infinite as Being . . . When that celestial church began to fall awaythey foresaw that the Infinite Manifestation, could no longer have influx intothe minds of men, and that thus the human race would perish; therefore it wasrevealed to them that One should be born who would make the human in HimselfDivine, and, in this way, become the same Infinite Manifestation that had beenbefore, and would, at last, become one with the Infinite as Being as also it hadbeen before. AC 46872 Only through the Divine Human can man ever come close toGod, and this has now been made visible to man in a more powerful and direct waythrough the Lord making his human Divine. Lest man should seek immediateapproach to the Father, who is invisible, and consequently inaccessible, withwhom there cannot be conjunction, He Himself came into the world and madeHimself visible, accessible, and capable of entering into conjunction with man,solely for this end, that man might be'saved. For unless God is approached inthought as man, all idea of God is lost, being like sight directed into theuniverse, that is into empty space, or it is directed upon nature or uponsomething visible in nature. VCR 538 The New Church will worship one visibleGod, in whom is the invisible God, as the soul is in the body. Only thus canthere be conjunction of God with man, because man is natural and consequentlythinks naturally ... for all conjunction of God with man must also be areciprocal conjunction of man with God; and reciprocation on man's part is onlypossible with a visible God. TCR 787 Because the Lord, standing where manstands, aligned the life of the natural mind (in the appearances of the senses)with the life of the spiritual mind (in the reality of heaven and the Divine),He is able to repeat that process in anyone who is willing to be helped in thisway from the higher Self (Divine Human) within, which can now be called the'Divine Redeemer'.NATURE OF DIVINE MANIFESTATION ZZ As the Lord delivered man from these evils bymaking the human in Himself Divine, therefore His Divine Human is called in theWord the 'Redeemer'. AC 6281 In the combats or temptations of men the Lord worksout a particular redemption, as he wrought a general redemption when in theworld. By His combats and temptations in the world the Lord glorified His human,that is, made it Divine. Similarly at this day with every individual during histemptations, He fights for him and overcomes the infernal spirits that infesthim, and after temptation glorifies him, that is makes him spiritual. TCR 599The Lord came into the world to glorify His human because in this way He becamethe Redeemer, Regenerator, and Saviour for ever. For it must not be supposedthat by the redemption once wrought in the world, all were thereafter redeemed;but that He is continually redeeming those who believe on Him and keep Hiscommandments. TCR 57936 DIVINE PROVIDENCE The goal of the Divine Love is to reunite man in freedomwith his Divine Source, termed by Swedenborg Conjunction with the Lord*. To thisend everything is governed by Divine Providence. It is the continual endeavourof the Divine Providence of the Lord to unite man to Himself and Himself to manin order that He may be able to bestow upon man the happiness of eternal life.DP 123 The end of creation is an angelic heaven out of the human race. DLW 330To achieve this God must allow the appearance of separateness in order topreserve man's freewill. The one and only thing by virtue of which man is man,and by means of which he is conjoined to the Lord, is the fact that he is ableto do what is good and believe what is true as ifofhimself] that is, as if ofhis own will in accordance with his own judgment. If this one and only thingwere taken away from man, everything conjunctive of man with the Lord and theLord with man would be taken away at the same time; for this is love'sreciprocality, which the Lord gives to everyone who is born a man and alsopreserves with him even to the end of his life and afterwards into eternity. AR5412 Nothing by Chance In order to attain this goal the Divine Providencegoverns not only the general things of a man's life and life in general, but thevery smallest of details imaginable. It is sheer falsity — a figment of theimagination, as it is called — to speak of the Lord's Providence as belonging tothe universal butDIVINE PROVIDENCE 79 not to its specific singulars; for to provide and governuniversally but not specifically is to provide and govern absolutely nothing. AC19194 Man can never be so regenerated that he can in any way be called perfect;for there are innumerable, nay, illimitable things to be regenerated both in therational and in the natural, and every one of them has an illimitable number ofshoots, that is progressions and derivations towards interior and exteriorthings. Man knows nothing at all of this; but the Lord knows each and everything, and provides for them at every moment. If He were to pause even for aninstant, all the progressions would be confused; for what is prior looks to whatfollows in a continuous series, and produces series of consequences to eternity.From this it is plain that the Divine Foresight and Providence are in everysmallest particular; and that unless this was so, or if Providence were onlyuniversal, the human race would perish. AC 51223 The Lord's Providence is in theminutest things of all, from the first thread of man's life even to the last,and afterwards to eternity. AC 5894 All things, indeed, the least of all things,down to the minutest of the minutest are directed by the Providence of the Lord,even as to the very steps . . . there is no such thing as chance, and apparentaccident or fortune is Providence in the ultimate of order. AC 6493 I onceplayed, in company, a common game of chance with dice, and the spirits who werewith me spoke to me about fortune in games, and said that what is fortunate wasrepresented to them by a bright cloud, and what is unfortunate by a dusky cloud;and that when a dusky cloud appeared with me, it was impossible for me to win;moreover, by this sign they predicted to me the turns of fortune in that game.From this it was granted me to know that what is attributed to fortune, even ingames, is from the spiritual world; much more that which befalls man in relationto the vicissitudes in the course of his life; and that what is called fortuneis from the influx of Providence in the ultimates of order, where it so comesforth; thus Providence is in the veriest singulars of all things, according tothe Lord's words, that not even a hair falls from the head without God's will.AC 6494 However, this control never intrudes into man's inner freedom of choice80 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS — else the overriding purpose of creationwould be lost. The Lord's Providence is a governing that a thing should be soand a bending of a person's freedom towards good insofar as He foresees thatthat person is going to allow himself in freedom to be bent towards it. AC 38691Therefore Providence must work invisibly. The Divine Providence works thusinvisibly and incomprehensibly in order that man may be in freedom to ascribe anevent either to Providence or to chance; for if Providence acted visibly andcomprehensibly, there would be danger of man's believing, from what he sees andcomprehends, that it is of Providence, and afterwards going to the otherextreme. AC 55082 Yet the effect of living one's life in harmony with Providenceis very marked. It is to be known that the Divine Providence is universal, thatis, in the least details; and that they who are in the stream of Providence areall the time being carried along toward happiness, whatever may be theappearance of the means; and that those are in the stream of Providence who puttheir trust in the Divine and attribute all things to Him; and that those whotrust in themselves alone and attribute all things to themselves are not in thestream of Providence, for they are in the opposite, since they take awayProvidence from the Divine and claim it for themselves. It is also to be knownthat so far as anyone is in the stream of Providence, so far he is in a state ofpeace; also that so far as anyone is in a state of peace from the good of faith,so far he is in the Divine Providence. AC 8478A Providence always looks to theultimate goal of a man's eternal life. How often we find, in retrospect, thatthe traumas in our lives can be seen as growth points to greater fulfilment. TheDivine Providence differs from all other leading and supervision in the factthat Providence continually regards what is eternal, and continually leads tosalvation, and this through various states, sometimes glad, sometimes sorrowful,which the man cannot possibly comprehend; but still they are all conducive tohis life in eternity. AC 8560DIVINE PROVIDENCE 81 The Lord provides for the good, who receive His mercy intime, such things as conduce to the happiness of their eternal life — riches andhonours for those to whom they are not hurtful, and no riches and honours forthose to whom they would be hurtful. Nevertheless to these latter He gives intime, instead of honours and riches, to be gladdened with a few things, and tobe more content than the rich and honoured. AC 87173 What endures to eternity,is; but what has an end respectively, is not. That which is, the Divineprovides; but not that which is not except so far as it conduces to that whichis; for Jehovah, who is the Divine itself, 15 and that which is from Him, alsois. It is therefore evident what is the quality of that which is given andprovided for man by the Divine, and what is the quality of what man procures forhimself. AC 10409' Divine Order and the Laws of Providence There is anunderlying order in all of creation maintained by universal laws on all levels.All these laws arise from aspects of Divine Love and Wisdom, according to whichDivine Providence operates in order to achieve the Divine Love's goal. Thus itwould be against the Divine Nature to deviate in the slightest from Its ownuniversal law of Love. The means by which man is led by the Lord are what arecalled the laws of the Divine Providence. DP 221 The Divine Providence is theDivine Order primarily with regard to the salvation of men; there is no orderwithout laws, as the Lord is His own Providence He is also the law of His ownProvidence. Hence it is clear that the Lord cannot act contrary to the laws ofHis Divine Providence, because to act contrary to them would be to act contraryto Himself. DP 3312 The Divine Love wishes to save all, but It can save only byDivine Wisdom, and to the Divine Wisdom belong all the laws through whichsalvation is affected. Love cannot transcend these laws since Divine Love andWisdom are one, and .act in unison. DLW 31 There is no one fixed way ofexpressing these laws, since the way the Law of Love is seen operating by finiteminds can be perceived in different ways. Swedenborg's most succinct summary ofthe main laws of Providence follows.82 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS 1. It is a law of the Divine Providence thatman should act from freedom according to reason. 2. It is a law of the DivineProvidence that man should as from himself remove evils as sins in the externalman; and thus and not otherwise can the Lord remove evils in the internal man,and then at the same time in the external. 3. It is a law of the DivineProvidence that man should not be compelled by external means to think and will,and thus to believe and love, the things of religion, but should persuade and attimes compel himself to do so. 4. It is a law of the Divine Providence that manshould be led and taught by the Lord from heaven by means of the Word, anddoctrine and preaching from the Word, and this to all appearance as of himself.5. It is a law of the Divine Providence that man should not perceive and feelanything of the operation of the Divine Providence, but still that he shouldknow and acknowledge it. 6. Evils are permitted for the sake of an end which issalvation. DP 71 100 129 154 175 234 Permission of Evil It is clear from theselaws that to achieve its ultimate purpose of uniting man to Itself in love andfreedom, Divine Love, in Its Wisdom, has given man the freedom to choose his own'good'. Inherent in that gift is the possibility that man in his unregeneratestate will make choices based on a belief in mere outer appearances and aconcern for himself alone, which, following the law of cause and effect, willtend to evil results. And though man's evil may be permitted to lead him to theends of the earth, the Divine purpose that he may return in freedom to theFather is ever present. Speaking on the heavenly marriage, on which more will besaid later, Swedenborg says The heavenly marriage is one in which heaven, and sothe Church, is united to the Lord by means of the proprium, even to the extentof it existing within the proprium itself; for if there is no proprium the uniondoes not exist. And when the Lord from His mercy instills into this propriuminnocence, peace, and good, it still looks like the proprium, but it is nowsomething heavenly and richly blessed. AC 252DIVINE PROVIDENCE 83 Therefore God permits man to inherit from his forefathers atendency to evil which Swedenborg describes as follows. Hereditary evil . . .consists in willing and hence thinking evil; hereditary evil being in the willitself and thence in the thought; and being the very tendency that is therein,and which adjoins itself even when the man does good. It is known by the delightthat is felt when evil befalls another. This root lies deeply hidden; for theinterior form itself which receives good and truth from heaven, that is, throughheaven from the Lord, is. . . distorted; so that when good and truth flow infrom the Lord they are either turned back, or perverted or suffocated ... It isfrom hereditary evil to love self more than others, to will evil to another ifhe does not honour oneself, to perceive delight in revenge, and also to love theworld more than heaven, and also ail cupidities or evil affections which arefrom the same source. AC 4317s There is no way anyone could be led out of thisinner state if the thinking, willing, and doing of evil were constantlyprevented. So far as a man's life is from what he inherits, and thus from self,if he were not permitted to be in evil he would have no life, and if he were notin freedom he would have no life. Also he cannot be forced to do good, and whatis forced does not abide; further that the good that man receives in freedom isimplanted in his will and becomes, as it were, his own. HH 293 Evils cannot beremoved unless they appear. This does not mean that man is to do evils in orderthat may they appear, but that he is to examine himself, not his actions only,but also his thoughts, and what he would do if he were not afraid of the lawsand disgrace; especially what evils he holds in his spirit to be allowable anddoes not regard as sins; for these he still commits. DP 278 The permission ofevil is for the sake of the end, namely, salvation ... If man were not permittedto think in accordance with the love of his will, which is implanted in him byinheritance, that love would remain shut in and would never be seen by him; andthe love of evil which does not make itself apparent is like an enemy in ambush,Hke matter in an ulcer, like poison in the blood and like corruption in thebreast which, if they are kept shut in, cause death. But when a man is permittedto think the evils of his life's love, so far as even84 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS to intend them, they are cured by spiritualmeans, as diseases are by natural means. DP 281ly2 It would have been possiblefor the Lord to heal the understanding in every man, and so cause him to thinknot evil but good, and this by means of fears of various kinds, by miracles, byconversations with the dead, and by visions and dreams. But to heal theunderstanding alone is to heal man outwardly only; for the understanding withits thought is the external of man's life, while the will with its affection isthe internal of his life. Therefore the healing of the understanding alone wouldbe like palliative healing, by which the interior malignity, shut in andprevented from coming out, would destroy first the near and then the remoteparts, till the whole would become mortified. DP 2827 REBIRTH (REGENERATION) As in traditional Christian teaching, man's fallencondition is overcome only by a spiritual rebirth, called regeneration.Spiritual rebirth, however, is not a once and for all occurrence, but a cyclicrecurrence, like the dawn of new days or springtimes. These natural cycles ofnight/day and the changing conditions of the seasons, correspond to theregenerative processes which take place in the spirit. The state of a personwhen he is being regenerated resembles cold and heat, that is, a point whenfaith and charity do not exist and then when they do . . . Through regenerationa person receives life itself from the Lord, and because he had no lifepreviously he alternates between no life and life itself, that is, between nofaith and charity and some faith and charity. Here no faith and charity is meantby cold, some faith and charity by heat. . . When he reverts to the body he isagain living in cold, and when the body or what belongs to the body is quiescentand so to speak nonexistent, he is living in heat. These two states come and goin turn. Man's condition is such that with him celestial and spiritual statescannot coexist with his bodily and wordly interests, but come and go in turn.This is the experience of everyone who is to be regenerated, and it continuesfor as long as his state is one of being regenerated. AC 933ii2}3 The changestaking place in people who have yet to be regenerated are likened to cold andheat, while those that take place in those who have been regenerated are likenedto summer and winter . . . The fact that a regenerate person experiencesalternations, that is to say, at one point no charity resides with him and atthe next some charity, is perfectly clear for the reason that with everybody,even the regenerate, nothing but evil exists. Everything good with him is theLord's alone.86 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS Because nothing but evil exists with him it isinevitable that he undergoes such changes, at one time living so to speak insummer, that is, in charity, and at another in winter, that is, in no charity.The result of such changes is that a person is being evermore perfected and somade evermore happy. Such changes take place with a regenerate person not onlyduring his lifetime but also when he has entered the next life, for withoutchanges like those of summer and winter as regards things of the will, and likethose of day and night as regards things of the understanding, he is in no wayperfected and made more happy. In the next life however people's changes arelike those of summer and winter in temperate regions and like those of day andnight in springtime. AC 935l%2 Continuousness Occasionally Swedenborg uses theterm regeneration in more limited specific ways (for example, to indicate anouter life brought into correspondence with a pure inner life), but in generalhe uses it to indicate an inner dynamic which if not impeded, operates from ourinfancy and on beyond our entry into heaven after death, bringing us into evercloser union with the Divine. From his earliest infancy to the end of his lifein the world and thereafter to eternity, a man who is in good is being bornagain every moment, not only as to interiors, but also as to exteriors, and thisby amazing processes. It is these processes that for the most part constituteangelic wisdom. AC 52024 A man who has been regenerated, and who also is inheaven, is alternately in external and in internal things: for external thingsare thereby set in order, so as to agree with internal things, and at length theformer things are subjected to the latter. So long as a man is in externalthings, he is in a state of labour and combat, for he is in a life which savoursof the world . . . but when a man is in internal things then the labour andcombat cease, since he is in heaven with the Lord; and then he is in thetranquillity of peace in which state also conjunction is affected. AC 92782 3 Nodefinite period of time ever exists when anyone is regenerate enough to be ableto say, 4now I am perfect'. In fact an unlimited number of states of evil andfalsity exist with everyone, not only simple states but also varied and complexones which . . . have to be disposed of in such a way that they do not recur. Insome states a person can beREBIRTH (REGENERATION) 87 called fairly perfect, but in countless others hecannot. People who have been regenerated during their lifetime, and in whoselives faith in the Lord and charity towards the neighbour have been present, arein the next life being perfected all the time. AC 894 Progress along the path ofregeneration involves the achievement of 2 number of goals. Regeneration is asuccessive separation from the evils which are related to the nativeinclinations. CL 146 Regeneration ... is the conjunction of the interiors withthe exteriors in man through love, consequently the conjunction in him of heavenwith the world. AC 5161 A man is regenerated by the truths with him beingconjoined with good, that is, by the things that belong to faith being conjoinedwith those which belong to charity. AC 4353 The end of regeneration is that theinternal man may be conjoined with the external, thus the spiritual, by means ofthe rational, with the natural. AC 43532 A man is enriched with spiritual andcelestial good when the things which are with him are disposed by the Lord intospiritual and celestial order, thus into an image and likeness of Divine Order:the regeneration of man is nothing else. AC 3017 Regeneration is nothing but thesubjugation of the natural and the dominion of the spiritual; and the natural issubjugated when it is reduced to correspondence. When the natural has beenreduced to correspondence it does not react any more, but acts as it iscommanded, and obeys the spiritual, almost as the acts of the body obey thebehest of the will, and as the speech and the expression of the face conform tothe influx of the thought. AC 56511 To be regenerated is said of those whosuffer themselves to be led on by the Lord, by truths which are called truths offaith, to the good of spiritual life. AC 8987 Conjunction with the Lord andregeneration are one, for so far as anyone is conjoined to the Lord he isregenerated. DP 92 When a person is being regenerated he compels himself fromthe88 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS freedom the Lord imparts to him, and humbles,and indeed afflicts, his rational, so that it may submit itself, and inconsequence he receives a heavenly proprium. This proprium is then graduallyperfected by the Lord and it becomes more and more free, so that as a result itbecomes the affection for good and for truth deriving from that good, andpossesses delight. And in that affection and delight there is happiness such asthe angels experience. AC 19472 Rebirth is thus effected by the Divine fromwithin. The inmost part of a person is where the Lord resides'with him, and fromthere governs the outlying parts. When a person permits the Lord to bring orderto the outlying parts so that these correspond to the inmost parts, his state issuch that he can be received into heaven, and the inmost, the interior, and theexternal parts of him act as one. AC 29734 Angels see and perceive in one who isbeing regenerated and with whom they are present as servants, all the changes ofstate he undergoes. And in accordance with those changes, and by means of them,the Lord enables those angels to lead him towards good, insofar as he allowshimself to be led. AC 4122 Remnant States The means for the process ofregeneration to begin are provided from man's infancy. All through his life andafter death, whatever the outer circumstances may appear, experiences ofheavenly states such as love, peace, joy, humility, trust, etc. are givenwithout conscious awareness. Such experience is stored in the 'memory' of the;nner man. Swedenborg calls them remnant states, or remains. Remnants... are allthe states of affection for good and truth conferred by the Lord on a personfrom earliest childhood right through to life's end. These states are storedaway in him for the use of his life after death, for in the next life all thestates of his life return one after another and at that time they undergomodification through the states of good and truth which the Lord has conferredon him. The more remnants he acquires therefore during his lifetime, or the moregood and truth he acquires, the happier and more beautiful the rest of hisstates seem to be when they actually return ... At birth . . . everything"},{"pageContent":"REBIRTH (REGENERATION) 89 good flows in, such as love for parents, nursemaids,and playmates, this influx being from innocence. These are the gifts which flowin from the Lord through the heaven of innocence and peace, which is the inmostheaven. AC 1906 Later on, when he grows up, this good, innocent, and peacefulstate of early childhood departs from him little by little; and in so far as heis introduced into the world, he enters into its pleasures and delights, and sointo evils, and the heavenly things or the goods of early childhood start to bedispersed. Yet they still remain, it being by means of these that the states aremoderated which a person takes to himself and acquires later on. Without them hecannot possibly be truly human, for states in which evil desires or any evilsoccur, if not moderated by means of states in which the affection for good ispresent, would be more dreadful than those of any animal. Those states of goodare what are called remnants, which are conferred by the Lord and implanted in aperson's natural disposition, this being done when a person is not aware of it.In later life he has further new states conferred on him; but these are not somuch states of good as of truth, for as he grows up he has truth bestowed onhim, and these in a similar way are stored away within his interior man. Bymeans of these remnants, which are those of truth, and which have been born fromthe influx of spiritual things from the Lord, a person has the ability to think,and also to understand what the good and truth of civil or public life and moralor private life are, and also to receive spiritual truth, that is, the truth offaith, yet he has no ability to do these things except by means of the remnantsof good which he received in early childhood. Of the existence of remnants andthe fact that they are stored away in man in his interior rational, man iscompletely unaware. AC 19062 3 There are also remnants acquired during theconflicts brought about by temptations. AC 1738 These seed experiences areindelibly imprinted on the inner soul but, like seeds planted in the earth, theyremain often for long periods unrecalled from memory. The Lord preserves [theseremnants] with a person and stores them away in his internal man, though theperson himself is not at all directly conscious of this. Here they are separatedcompletely from the things90 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS that are the person's own, that is, evils andfalsities. AC 561 At this stage (the planting), man's freewill is not involved —they are gratuitous sowings. The regenerative process whereby they may grow andbecome a permanent, developed part of a man's spirit takes place later inseveral stages. Remnants are let down into the exterior or natural man when heis in a state of good; but the moment he comes into a state of evil they aredrawn back and stored up again. The reason of their being drawn back and storedup again, is to prevent their being mingled with evils, and thus perishing. Whena man cannot be regenerated, the remnants in him are carefully preserved in hisinteriors. But when a man is being regenerated, then in so far as this is thecase, the remains are let down from the interiors into the exteriors, for thereason that by regeneration the interiors are conjoined with the exteriors andact as one. Remnants are then first let down to generals, and afterwardssuccessively to particulars. AC 6156 When the time comes that man is capable ofbeing regenerated then the Lord inspires the affection of good, and therebyexcites the things that were adjoined to that affection by him, which things arecalled remnants in the Word, and then by means of this affection, that is, theaffection of good, he removes the affections of other loves successively,consequently also the things that were connected with them. AC 33361 ConscienceThe quality of mind we call conscience is first formed from what a man learnsfrom others to be true — even though it be fallacious. (To some extent belief infallacies is inevitable considering the limitations of the finite mind.)Everyone supposes that his own accepted belief is the truth, and on this basisacquires a conscience. Consequently once he has acquired a conscience, actingcontrary to the things that have been impressed on him as being the truths offaith is to him acting contrary to conscience. AC 10432 The conscience of thosewho are of the spiritual church is a conscience of truth, for it is acquiredfrom the doctrines of the church, which are believed to be truths whether theyare truths or not, AC 8081REBIRTH (REGENERATION) 91 Conscience can be either more spiritual (internal) ormore natural (external). Man has a conscience of what is good and a conscienceof what is right. The conscience of what is good is the conscience of theinternal man, and the conscience of what is right is the conscience of theexternal man. The conscience of what is good consists in acting according to thecommandments of faith from an internal affection; the conscience of what isright, in acting from external affection according to civil and moral laws. AC9119 Conscience can bring immediate spiritual benefit. Those who rejoice in aconscience are in the tranquillity of peace and internal blessedness when theyact according to it, and suffer a certain uneasiness when they act contrary toit. TCR 666 Conscience can also bring immediate spiritual pain. With aregenerate man there is joy when he acts according to conscience, and there isanxiety when he is compelled to do anything or to think anything againstconscience. AC 911 A sensitive conscience can easily become overburdened attimes due to the influence of certain spirits in the spiritual world. Thesespirits raise scruples of conscience as it were, and insinuate them into manwith regard to matters about which something doubtful occurs which they supposeto be a duty, and so charge him with sin in many things; thus they burden theconscience with matters with which it should not be burdened. There are manysuch in the world, and they are called the conscientious, for what a trueconscience is they do not know, but make everything that happens a matter ofconscience. SD 1240 There is also a spurious conscience and a false conscienceto be aware of. Conscience in general is either true, spurious, or false. Trueconscience is a conscience formed by the Lord from truths of faith. Once it hasbeen conferred a person is afraid to act contrary to the truths of faith becauseto do so is to act contrary to conscience . . . Spurious conscience is aconscience formed with gentiles from the religious worship in which they havebeen born and brought up. For them acting contrary22 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS to that religious worship is acting contraryto conscience. When their conscience is grounded in charity and mercy, and inobedience, they are people such as are able to receive a true conscience in thenext life, and do indeed receive it. . . False conscience is a conscience formednot from internal things but from external, that is, not from charity but fromself love and love of the world. In fact there are people who seem to themselvesto be acting contrary to conscience when they act against their neighbour, andwho also at such times seem to themselves to be inwardly smitten. Yet the reasonis that (hey perceive in their thought that their own life, position,reputation, wealth, or financial gain is at stake, and so perceive that theythemselves are being hurt. AC 1033{3 Enlightenment How is one to know whether ornot what others teach is true, and so to avoid developing a spurious conscience?What is needed above all else is a genuine love of truth for its own sake — andbecause it helps one to be truly useful in life. A man is in enlightenment whenhe is in the love of truth for the sake of truth, and not for the sake of selfand the world. AC 94242 Everyone's enlightenment is of such a quality as is hisaffection of the truth, and the quality of the affection of the truth is such asis the good of life. Hence also it is, that those who are in no affection of thetruth for the sake of the truth, but for the sake of gain, are not at allenlightened when they read the Word, but are simply confirmed in doctrines, ofwhatever character they be, whether false, as heretical doctrines are, oraltogether contrary to truths. AC 7012 None . . . can see whether the doctrinalteaching of their church is true, except those who are in the affection of truthfor the sake of the uses of life. They who have this end are continuallyenlightened by the Lord, not only during their life in the world, but alsoafterwards. AC 85213 Humility is another essential element for enlightenment.Those who read the Word, and who then look to the Lord, by acknowledging thatall good and all truth is from him, and nothing from themselves, areenlightened. AC 9405REBIRTH (REGENERATION) 93 Reliance on the authority of any particular doctrineshould only be a temporary stepping stone to receiving enlightenment directlyfrom within. First the doctrinal things of the church must be learned, and thenthe Word must be examined to see whether these are true; for they are not truebecause the heads of the church have said so and their followers confirm it,because in this way the doctrinal things of all churches and religions wouldhave to be called true . . . This shows that the Word must be searched, and itmust be seen there whether the doctrinal things are true. When this is done fromthe affection of truth, then the man is enlightened by the Lord so as toperceive, without knowing whence, what is true; and he is confirmed therein inaccordance with the good in which he is . . . No one is forbidden to search thescriptures from the desire to know whether the doctrines of the church withinwhich he was born are true; for in no other way can he be enlightened. AC 60472} Those who are in the genuine affection of truth, that is, who desire to knowtruths for the sake of good use and for the sake of life, also abide in thedoctrines of the church until they arrive at an age when they begin to think forthemselves; then they search the scriptures and supplicate the Lord forenlightenment, and when they are enlightened they rejoice from the heart; forthey know that if they have been born where there is another doctrine of thechurch, even where is the greatest heresy, without searching the scriptures fromthe genuine affection of truth, they would have remained in that doctrine. AC89934 So man is to become a genuine seeker, searching the scriptures andgradually building up his own spiritual philosophy under guidance orenlightenment from within. Those who are in the spiritual affection of truth,when they read the Word, do not see it from the doctrine of the church in whichthey are born, but they see it as if they were separated from that doctrine,because they desire to be enlightened, and to see truths inwardly in themselves,and not from others. Those who are in such a state are enlightened by the Lord,and it is granted to them to form to themselves doctrine from the truths whichthey themselves see; this doctrine also is implanted in them, and remains intheir spirit to eternity. But24 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS those who read the Word from the doctrinewhich they receive from others, cannot see truths from the light of their ownspirit, thus not inwardly in themselves, but out of themselves; for they believeit to be true because others have seen it, and therefore they attend only tosuch things as serve for confirmation, other things they either pass by as ifthey did not see them, or draw them to the side of things which their doctrinedictates. AE 190 Repentance In the New Testament, the word repentance is atranslation of the Greek word metanoia. The literal translation oimetanoia is'change of mind or resolve'. In terms of spiritual space, it is a complete turnabout — from keeping one's back to the Divine, to turning around towards it. ForSwedenborg this crucial step in the soul's development involves a number ofstages. Actual repentance is to examine oneself, to recognize and acknowledgeone's own sins, to take the responsibility, to confess them before the Lord, tobeg for help and power to resist them, and in this way to give them up and leada new life, and to do all these things as from yourselves. AR 5315 A man whoexamines himself for the purpose of practising repentance, should explore histhought, and the intentions of his will; and there he ought to examine what hewould do, if he were at liberty; that is, if he were not afraid of the laws, andthe loss of reputation, honour, and gain. HD 164 Repentance is a kind of holdingoneself apart from what one sees and acknowledges to be selfish (sinful) inoneself. No one can be said to repent unless he actually separates himself fromthose things of which he has repented; and he separates himself from them whenhe shuns them and holds them in aversion. AE 143 But how is one freed orreleased from the grip of selfish desires? Forgiveness (Remission of Sins) Herewe need to distinguish clearly between the attitude of the one who forgives, andthe response made by the one forgiven to that which he is forgiven. First let usrecall the nature of Divine forgiveness. Towards [the human race] there is aDivine, that is, an infinite love,REBIRTH (REGENERATION) 95 and there is a Divine, that is, an infinite mercy . .. the Lord continually excuses, and continually forgives, for He continuallypities. AC 85732 Forgiveness is an attitude or state of choosing to push to theside, ('remit'), disregard, not see the evils in another, but only the good inhim. To forgive is to regard one, not from evil, but from good. AC 7697 Theforgiveness or remission of sins is the separation of evil from good. AC 9013*What is not attended to is said to be remitted. AC 10504 Sins are removed bylove and faith from the Lord. AC 9938 The Lord forgives [remits] everyone's sins. . . they are not on that account forgiven unless the man performs seriousrepentance and desists from evils, and afterwards lives a life of faith andcharity, and this even to the end of his life. When this is the case, manreceives from the Lord spiritual life, which is called new life. When from thislife the man regards the evils of his former life, and turns away from them andabhors them, then first are the evils remitted, for then the man is held intruths and goods by the Lord, and withheld from evils. AC 90143 But for this tobe achieved something else of tremendous importance has to take place. Mancannot be delivered from damnation except by the removal of evil, and theremoval of evil is not affected except by the actual repentance which is oflife; and these things take place by means of spiritual temptations, which arethe grievous things of repentance. AC 9077 Temptation Combat This is thecrucially dynamic spiritual process that can utterly change a man's life fromwithin — the testing of where he really stands when the chips are down. Thistesting is never brought about directly by God, but is permitted to take placefor the sake of spiritual growth. The Lord never curses anyone, is never angrywith anyone, never leads anyone into temptation, and never punishes, let alonecurses anybody. It is the devil's crew who do such things. Such things cannotpossibly come from the fountain of mercy, peace, and goodness. AC 245Temptations and torments appear as if they were from the Divine,?6 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS because, as before said, they come aboutthrough the Lord's Divine presence; but still they are not from the Divine, orfrom the Lord, but from the evils and falsities which are in him who is temptedor tormented. For, from the Lord proceeds nothing but the holiness which is goodand true and merciful. This holiness, namely, the good and true and merciful, iswhat those who are in evils and falsities cannot endure, because they areopposite or contrary. AC 4299} This process often commences as a result of goingagainst one's conscience. As soon as a man does or utters anything contrary toconscience, he runs into temptation and the gnawings of conscience, that is,into a kind of hellish torment. AC 9862 By 'temptation' Swedenborg is clearlyreferring to something rather different to the normal idea of temptations, whichhe sometimes terms natural temptations to distinguish from true spiritualtemptations. Spiritual temptations are of the internal man, but naturaltemptations are of the external man. Spiritual temptations sometimes existwithout natural temptations, sometimes with them. Temptations are natural when aman suffers as to the body, as to honours, as to wealth, in a word, as tonatural life, as is the case in diseases, misfortunes, persecutions, unjustpunishments, and the like. The anxieties which then arise, are what are meant bynatural temptations. But these temptations effect nothing whatever toward man'sspiritual life, neither can they be called temptations, but griefs; for theyexist from injury to natural life, which is that of love of the self and theworld. The wicked are sometimes in these griefs, and the more they lovethemselves and the world, and thus have life therefrom, so much the more do theygrieve and suffer. But spiritual temptations are of the internal man, and attackhis spiritual life. In this case the anxieties are not on account of any loss ofnatural life, but on account of the loss of faith and charity, and consequentlyof salvation. These temptations are often induced by natural temptations; forwhen a man is in these, that is in disease, grief, the loss of wealth or honour,and the like, if then he begins to think about the Lord's help, His Providence,the state of the evil, in that they glory and exalt when the good suffer andundergo various griefs and losses, then spiritual temptation is conjoined withthe natural temptation. AC 8164REBIRTH (REGENERATION) 97 True spiritual temptations occur when it is felt thatthe heavenly qualities implanted by God are being assaulted in any way. Alltemptation is an attack against the love present in a person, the degree oftemptation depending on the degree of that love. If love is not attacked thereis no temptation. AC 16903 The 'attack' is due to the close presence of negativeinfluences (the sphere of that region of the inner hell into which the man hascome). The defence comes from the opposite heavenly sphere, the angelic, in theheavenly inner region under assault. Spiritual temptation when it takes place insomeone is a conflict between the evil spirits and the angels residing with thatperson, and he ordinarily feels that conflict in his conscience. As regards suchconflict it should be recognized in addition that the angels are protecting manconstantly and are warding off the evils that evil spirits direct against him.They protect even the falsities and the evils with a person, for they are fullyaware of where the person's falsities and evils come from — from evil spiritsand genii. Man in no sense produces any falsity and evil from himself. Insteadit is the evil spirits residing with him who produce them, and as they do theyalso convince him that these originate in himself . . . and what is more, themoment they instil this into him and convince him, they also accuse and condemnhim . . . Anyone who has no faith in the Lord is incapable of being enlightenedin the matter; he inevitably believes than an evil is from himself. Consequentlyhe makes the evil his own and becomes like those evil spirits residing with him.Such is the situation with man. And as the angels are aware of it they protecteven a person's falsities and evils while he is undergoing the temptations thatare part of regeneration. AC 761 The techniques used by evil spirits are many,but can all be seen by the spiritually aware in operation in ordinary daily lifein the world. There are evil spirits . . . who activate a person's falsities andevils . . . indeed they draw out of his memory whatever he has thought andcarried out since early childhood. Evil spirits can do this so cleverly andwickedly as to defy description. But the angels who are with him draw out hisgoods and truths, and in this way defend him. AC 75198 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS Infernal spirits call up the evils which a manhas done, and pervert and put a wrong interpretation upon the good things. AC6202 A state of temptation ... is also like the condition of a pit or dungeon —squalid and unclean; for when man is being tempted, unclean spirits are nearhim, and surround him, and excite the evils and falsities in him, and also keephim in them and exaggerate them, even to despair. AC 52462 There are evilspirits who inflict pain and despair concerning salvation. AC 6828 Anyone who isundergoing temptation experiences doubt as regards the end in view. That end isthe love against which evil spirits and evil genii fight and in so doing placethe end in doubt. And the greater his love is, the more they place it in doubt .. . Evil spirits who are ill disposed and deceitful worm their way into thosevery loves by flattering them and in this way they bring a person in amongthemselves. And once they have brought him in, they very soon try to destroy hisloves and so to slay that person, which they do in a thousand unimaginable ways... In their attacks they pervert goods and truths, setting these ablaze with acertain kind of evil desire and of persuasion, so that the person himself doesnot know any other than that similar desire and persuasion reign within in him.At the same time they infuse those goods and truths with delight which theyseize from the delight which that person has in some other thing. In these waysthey infect and infest him most deceitfully, doing it all so skillfully byleading him from the one thing to another that if the Lord did not come to hisaid, the person would never know other than that it was indeed so. They act insimilar ways against the affections of truth that constitute conscience as soonas they become aware of anything, whatever the nature of it, that is aconstituent part of that conscience, they mould an affection out of thefalsities and weaknesses that exist with that person, and by means of thataffection they dim the light of truth and so pervert it, or else they cause himanxiety and torment. In addition to this they keep his thought firmly fixed onone single thing; and they fill that thought with delusions, at the same timesecretly incorporating evil desires within those delusions. Besides this theyuse countless other devices which cannot possibly be described so as to beunderstood. TheseREBIRTH (REGENERATION) 22 are a few of the ways — and only very general ones —by which they are able to get at a person's conscience, which above all elsethey take the greatest delight in destroying. AC 18202'4 The effect of theseattacks is to give rise to certain states which can be clearly identified. Aslong as temptation lasts, a person assumes that the Lord is not present, for heis being harassed by evil genii, so harassed in fact that sometimes he has sogreat a feeling of hopelessness as scarcely to believe in the existence of anyGod at all. Yet at such times the Lord is more present than that person couldpossibly believe. But once temptation subsides he receives comfort, and for thefirst time believes that the Lord is present. AC 840 Those who are liberatedfrom temptations first come into obscurity before coming into clearness, for thefalsities and evils injected by the hells adhere to them for some time, and arenot dissipated except gradually. AC 8199 These painful negative experiences maybe quite prolonged. The law of order concerning those who are in a state ofinfestations by falsities is that they must be infested even to despair, andunless they are infested to despair, the ultimate of the use resulting from theinfestation is wanting. AC 1166 Despair is the last stage of this state, becausethereby the delight of the love of self and of the world is removed, and thedelight of the love of good and of truth is introduced in its place; for in thecase of those to be regenerated, the despair is about spiritual life, andconsequently about the privation of truth and good, because when such personsare deprived of truth and good they despair of spiritual life; hence they feeldelight and bliss when they come out of their despair. AC 5219 Those who are intemptations, and not in any other active life than that of prayers, do not knowthat if the temptations were intermitted before they had been fully completed,they would not be prepared for heaven, and thus could not be saved. For thisreason, also, the prayers of those who are in temptations are but little heeded;for the Lord wills the end, which is man's salvation, which end He knows,1QQ SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS but not the man; and the Lord does not act infavour of prayers that are against that end, which is salvation. AC 8179* Butthe ultimate outcome depends upon the man's free response to these experiences.Men must have faith that salvation is from the Lord alone, and not at all fromthem, because this is the principal thing of faith in temptations. He whobelieves when he is tempted that he can resist from his own strength, yields;the reason is that he is in falsity, and that he therefore attributes merit tohimself, and thus demands to be saved of himself, and he then shuts out theinflux from the Divine. But he who believes that the Lord alone resists intemptations, conquers; for he is in the truth, and attributes the merit to theLord, and perceives that he is saved by the Lord alone. AC 8172 If the eventualoutcome is good the man experiences a most noticeable change of state. All thosewho are being regenerated by the Lord undergo temptations; after temptationsthey experience joys. When therefore, a man's evils and falsities are removed,then temptations are brought to an end; and then joy flows in through heavenfrom the Lord, and fills a man's natural mind . . . The reason why a manreceives joys after temptations is, that afterwards he is admitted into heaven;for by temptations a man is conjoined to heaven, and admitted into it. AE 897The spiritual results are equally impressive. By temptations, also, the lustswhich are the loves of the self and the world are subdued, and the man ishumbled. Thus he is rendered fit to receive the life of heaven from the Lord,which life is the new life, such as the regenerate man has. AC 8966 Bytemptations the spiritual or internal man acquires dominion over the natural orexternal man, thus the good which is of charity and faith, over the evil whichis of the love of self and of the world. When this is effected, man hasenlightenment and perception as to what is true and what is good, and also as towhat is evil and false; and hence he has intelligence and wisdom, whichafterwards increase daily. AC 8967 Despair [in temptation] also causes them tofeel the happiness of lifeREBIRTH (REGENERATION) 101 from the Lord; for when they come out of that state,they are like those who have been condemned to death, and are set free fromprison. Moreover, by means of desolations and temptations, states contrary toheavenly life are felt, the result of which is the implantation of a feeling andperception of the satisfaction and happiness of heavenly life; for a feeling andperception of what is satisfying and happy is impossible without comparison withthe opposites. AC 6144 After a man has passed through temptation, he is as tohis internal man in heaven, while remaining in the world as to his external man.Therefore, by means of temptations there is affected in him the conjunction ofheaven and the world; and then the Lord, abiding with him, rules his world fromheaven according to order. TCR 598 After every spiritual temptation there comeenlightenment and affection, thus pleasantness and delight; pleasantness fromenlightenment by truth, and delight from the affection of good. AC 8367 When thespirits who are in evil and falsity are conquered by the spirits who are in goodand truth, and are compelled to depart, the latter have joy through heaven fromthe Lord, and this joy is perceived by the man as consolation, and as inhimself. But the joy and consolation are not on account of victory, but onaccount of the conjunction of good and truth; for all conjunction of good andtruth has joy within itself, because this conjunction is the heavenly marriagewithin which is the Divine. AC 4572 If however a person gives way in temptationhis spiritual state deteriorates. To yield in temptations is to be confirmed infalsities and evils against the truths and goods of faith . . . hence it isplain, that in yielding in temptations there is a blaspheming of truth and good,and sometimes profanation; and the greatest and most direful damnation of all isdamnation from profanation. AC 8169 Redemption In this Divine rescue operation,the Lord, through the mediation of angels, fights for man in his temptationcombats. When victory has been achieved, man experiences a deep inner peace.This is a mark of the state called redemption, and is experienced each time evilwithin is overcome.1Q2 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS The regeneration of a man, in as much as itis a separation and deliverance from evils and falsities, is a particularredemption by the Lord, proceeding from His general redemption. Cor 211 The goalof redemption, and the prize of the redeemed, is spiritual peace. Cor 2110 So,although Jesus Christ on earth overcame the power of all man's evil in Himself,the Divine work of rescuing or redeeming goes on. It must not be supposed thatby the redemption once wrought in the world, all were, thereafter, redeemed; butthat the Lord is continually redeeming those who believe on Him and keep Hiscommandments. TCR 5793 Faith Is a man redeemed and saved by his faith? It alldepends on how 'faith' is understood. There are many who declare that man issaved through faith, or as they say, if he merely has faith. But the majority ofsuch people do not know what faith is. Some imagine that it is mere thought;some that it is the acknowledgement of something which ought to be believed;others that it is the entire doctrine of faith which ought to be believed. . .Faith however is not mere thought. . . [for] thought does not save anyone.AC22282 To believe the things which the Word or doctrine teaches, and not tolive according to them, appears like faith . . . but by this alone no one issaved, for it is a persuasive faith. AC 9363 What then does this term faith meanto Swedenborg? Faith is an internal affection which consists in willing from theheart to know what is true and good, and this not for the sake of doctrine asthe end, but for the sake of life. AC 8034 Faith is the eye of love, the Lordbeing seen by love through faith, and love being the life of faith. AC 3863 nFaith without love is dead, and faith with love is living. AC 90506 All who arein heavenly love have confidence that they will be saved by the Lord. AC 9244REBIRTH (REGENERATION) 103 Charity Swedenborg uses the word 'charity' todescribe those qualities of spirit which extend the Lord's love for Hischildren. Charity means love towards the neighbour and compassion, for anyonewho loves his neighbour as himself also has as much compassion for him in hissuffering as he does for himself in his own. AC351 Charity is to will well toanother, to society, to one's country, to the church, to the Lord's Kingdom, andthus to the Lord Himself. AC 4776 No one can have a wise and intelligentdiscernment of what truth is unless good, that is, charity, reigns in him. AC34123 Those who have charity hardly notice the evil in another person, butinstead notice all the good and truth that are his; and on his evil and falsitythey place a good interpretation. Of such a nature are all angels, it beingsomething they have from the Lord, who bends everything evil into good. AC 10792Charity itself regards the good of a man's soul first, and loves it a< beingthat by which conjunction is effected. Char 608 ANGELIC NATURE Swedenborg reports very many experiences of encounters withangels. But the true quality of the angelic can only be known from deep withinoneself and from there recognized in another being. So also with Swedenborg. Hisaccounts of the angelic are self-discoveries — for him, as they can be for us instudying his descriptions and accounts. In what follows we learn much of theheavenly in the 'new* Swedenborg himself, writing now with feeling and in depthon qualities which he had barely mentioned before his enlightenment. AbstractedThought and Speech The communication of the angels is, as might be expected,remarkably more universal in character than man's normal level of language. Inthe other life, especially in the heavens, all thought and hence all speech, arecarried on in an impersonal sense, and therefore thought and speech there areuniversal, and are relatively without limit; for so far as thought and speechare associated with persons and their specific qualities, and with names, andalso words, so far they become less universal, and are associated with theactual thing, and there abide. On the other hand in so far as they are notassociated with persons and what is connected with them, but with realitiesabstracted from them, so far they are dissociated from the actual thing, and areextended beyond themselves, and the mental view becomes higher and consequentlymore universal. AC 5287 Abstract speech, that is, speech separate from man, isangelic speech, since in heaven they think of the entity apart from the persons.For there, when the person also is thought of, the society which is in such anentity is excited, and thus the thought is determined thither, and is fixed; forin heaven, where there is thought there is presence,ANGELIC NATURE 105 and presence would bend to itself the thoughts of those whoare in the society, and would thus disturb the influx from the Divine there. Itis otherwise when they think abstractly concerning the entity; then the thoughtdiffuses itself in every direction according to the heavenly form which theinflux proceeding from the Divine produces, and this without the disturbance ofany society. For it insinuates itself into the general spheres of the societies,and in this case does not touch or move anyone in the society, thus does notdivert anyone from the freedom of thinking according to the influx from theDivine. In a word, abstract thought can pervade the whole heaven without delayanywhere; but thought determined to person, or to place, is fixed, and arrested.AC 8985 Love We have looked at the nature of Divine Love earlier, but how doesthe angelic nature receive and respond to the Lord's love? The nature of theLord's love surpasses all human understanding and is unbelievable in the extremeto people who do not know what heavenly love is in which angels abide. To save asoul from hell the angels think nothing of giving their own lives; indeed if itwere possible they would suffer hell themselves in place of that soul.Consequently their inmost joy is to transport into heaven someone rising fromthe dead. They confess however that that love does not originate one little bitin themselves but that every single aspect of it does so in the Lord alone. AC20772 Heavenly or celestial love does not wish to exist for itself but for all,thus to impart all that is its own to others. It is in this that heavenly loveessentially consists. AC 1419 Timelessness In his natural state, man feelscircumscribed by the passing of measured time, and often so influenced by thepast and concerned for the future, that the reality of the eternal presentescapes him. I have spoken with the angels about the memory of past things, andthe anxiety thence arising about what is to come, and have been instructed, thatthe more interior and perfect the angels are, the less care they have about whatis past, and the less do they think about106 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS what is to come, and that hence also is theirhappiness. They say, that the Lord gives them every moment what to think, andthis with blessedness and happiness, and that thus they are without cares andanxieties. . . but although they have no care about what is past, and have nosolicitude about what is to come, they have still the most perfect remembranceof what is past, and intuition of what is to come, since both the past and thefuture are in all their present. AC 2493 When a man is in a state of love, or ofcelestial affection, he is in an angelic state, that is to say, as if not intime, provided there is no impatience in the affection ... by the affection ofgenuine love man is withdrawn from bodily and wordly things, for his mind iselevated towards heaven, and thus is withdrawn from the things of time. AC 3821Angels ... do not know what a period of time is, for the activity of the sun andmoon with them does not produce divisions of time. As a consequence they do notknow what a day or a year is, but only what states and changes of state are. AC488* The more interior and perfect the angels are, the less have they of thememory of the past, and therein consists their happiness, for in every momentthe Lord grants them what is pleasant to them, and what they think and areaffected with. SD 2188 When states determine time, then time is only anappearance. For joyfulness of state makes time appear short, and joylessness ofstate makes time appear long. From which it is evident that time in thespiritual world is nothing but a quality of state. DLIV 13 Eternity... ismanifested continually by means of time to those who dwell within time. . . Thepresent with the angels includes past and future together. Consequently theyhave no anxiety about things of the future. AC 1382 Freedom The seeming paradoxof angelic freedom — that the more one is united to God, the more one is free toexpress one's true individuality, is explained by Swedenborg. Heavenly freedomconsists in being led by the Lord. AC 9589ANGELIC NATURE 107 The more distinctly a man appears to himself to be master ofhimself the more clearly he perceives that he is the Lord's, because the morenearly he is conjoined to the Lord the wiser he becomes... the angels of thethird heaven, because they are the wisest of the angels . . . call it freedomitself; but to be led by themselves they call slavery. DP 44 Since everythingthat a man does from freedom appears to him to be his own for it is of his love... it follows that conjunction with the Lord makes a man appear to himself tobe free and consequently to be master of himself; and the nearer the conjunctionwith the Lord the more free he seems, and consequently the more he seems to bemaster of himself. He appears to himself more distinctly to be master of himselfbecause the Divine Love is such that it wills that what is Its own should belongto another. DP 432 Proprium (Ego) Contrary to some spiritual teaching, theproprium or ego is never to be annihilated, but only (and repeatedly) pushedaside by the life from God by man's own choice. This is as true of the angelicstate after death as it is in this life, for without proprium there is nofreedom of choice. So the angels are left perpetually free to receive love andwisdom in place of the self-centredness of the old ego. Angels are not angelsfrom their proprium. Their proprium is exactly like that of a man and this isevil. That an angePs proprium is such is because all angels have been men, andthat proprium adheres to them from birth. It is only removed, and to the extentthat it is removed, to that extent they receive love and wisdom, that is, theLord, in themselves. . . The Lord can dwell with angels only in what is His,that is, in what is His very own, which is love and wisdom, and certainly not inthe angePs proprium which is evil Hence it is that so far as evil is removed sofar the Lord is in them, and so far they are angels. The very angelic itself ofheaven is the Divine Love and Wisdom. This Divine is called the angelic when itis in angels. From this again it is clear that angels are angels from the Lord,and not from themselves. DLW 114 The angelic state in heaven is that they do notwill and act, nor even think and speak, anything from self, or from theirproprium. In this1Q8 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS their conjunction with the Lord consists. . .This state with the angels is the heavenly state itself, and when they are init, they have peace and rest, and the Lord also has rest; for when they areconjoined with Him, they labour no more because they are then in the Lord. AC84953 Innocence The heavenly state is guilt free or guiltless since the Divinewithin is allowed to guide and act through one, even though the angel stillfeels as if he were deciding and acting of himself. As innocence consists inbeing led by the Lord and not by self, so all who are in heaven are ininnocence; for all who are there love to be led by the Lord, knowing that tolead themselves is to be led by the proprium, and the proprium consists inloving oneself, also that he who loves himself does not suffer himself to be ledby another. Therefore so far as an angel is in innocence, he is in heaven . . .those who are in the inmost or third heaven . . . more than all others love tobe led by the Lord as little children by their father. For the same reason theDivine truth that they hear immediately from the Lord or mediately through theWord and preaching, they take directly into their will and do it, thuscommitting it to life . . . These angels of the inmost heaven, being such, arenearest to the Lord from whom they have innocence, and are so separated from theproprium that they live, as it were, in the Lord. In external form, they appearsimple, and before the eyes of the angels of the lower heavens they seem aslittle children, that is, as very small and not very wise, although they are thewisest of the angels of heaven; for they know that they have nothing of wisdomfrom themselves, and that to acknowledge this is to be wise. What they know isas nothing compared to what they do not know; and they say that knowing,acknowledging, and perceiving this is the first step towards wisdom. Theseangels are naked, because nakedness corresponds to innocence. HH 280 Becauseinnocence is the inmost in all the good of heaven, it so affects minds that whenit is felt by anyone — as when an angel of the inmost heaven approaches — heseems to himself to be no longer his own master and is moved and, as it were,carried away by such a delight that no delight of the world seems to be anythingin comparison with it. HH282ANGELIC NATURE 109 Innocence is a willingness to be led by the Lord and not byoneself. Consequently, so far as a man is in innocence he is separated from hisproprium. HH 341 Innocence attributes nothing of good to itself, but attributesall good to the Lord... an angel is a wise child in an eminent sense. HH 2753Peace All man's troubles stem from believing in the ego's illusion — that one isseparate and self-contained, and what is in one is one's own. Cease to fall forthis error, and heavenly states are experienced — especially peace. The state oftranquillity and peace [in heaven] is from no other source than that the angelperceives that all things inflow, and that evil is not his, nor good his; thushe is in peace, and yet, as it were, he appropriates the good. SD (minor) 4696He who is endowed with heavenly selfhood is also at rest and in peace; for hetrusts in the Lord and believes that nothing evil will reach him and knows thatlusts will not infest him. AC 5660 Peace has in it confidence in the Lord, thatHe rules all things and provides all things, and that He leads to a good end.When a man is in the faith of these things he is in peace, for he then fearsnothing, and no solicitude about things to come disquiets him. A man comes intothis state in proportion as he comes into love to the Lord . . . Peace is theinmost in all delight, even in what is undelightful with the man who is in good.So far therefore as he puts off what is external, so far the state of peace isrevealed, and so far he is affected with satisfaction, blessedness andhappiness, the origin of which is from the Lord himself AC 8455 That innocenceand peace are together like good and its delight can be seen in little children,who, because they are in innocence, are also in peace, and because they are inpeace they are in their whole nature full of play. HH288 Wisdom The wonderfulparadox here is that the more you know, the more you realize you do not know.Hence the wisest are the most humble.11Q SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS Angelic wisdom involves perceiving whether athing is good or true without reasoning about it. AC 1385 That the angels havenothing of wisdom and intelligence of themselves, they themselves openlyconfess; indeed they are indignant if anyone ascribes anything of wisdom andintelligence to them, for they know and perceive that this would be to take awayfrom the Divine that which is Divine, and to claim for themselves that which isnot theirs, thus to incur the crime of spiritual theft. . . The angels arecontinually being perfected by the Lord, and yet can never to eternity be so farperfected that their wisdom and intelligence can be compared to the Divinewisdom and intelligence of the Lord; for they are finite and the Lord isinfinite. AC 42952'3 The wisdom of angels is indescribable in words, but canonly be illustrated by some general things. Angels can express in a single wordwhat man cannot express in a thousand words. Again, a single angelic wordcontains innumerable things that cannot be expressed in the words of humanlanguage. For in every single word spoken by angels, there are arcana of wisdomin a continuous connection to which human knowledges never reach . . . Theinterior angels also can know from the tone together with a few of the words theentire life of one speaking. HH 269 Genuine innocence is wisdom. For so far asanyone is wise he loves to be led by the Lord, or what is the same, so far asanyone is led by the Lord he is wise. HH 341 The following observation on thenature of thought is very reminiscent of Swedenborg's theory of the origin ofmatter in his Principia, and is being more and more confirmed by science everyday. Every grain of your thought, and every drop of your affection is divisibleto infinity, and that so far as your ideas are divisible you are wise. Know thenthat everything divided is more and more multiple, and not more and more simple;for when divided again and again, it approaches nearer and nearer to theinfinite in which are all things infinitely... A single natural idea is thevessel of innumerable spiritual ideas ... a single spiritual idea is the vesselof innumerable celestial ideas. Hence the distinction between celestial wisdom,in which are the angels of the third heaven, and spiritual wisdom in which areANGELIC NATURE 111 the angels of the second heaven; and also between the latterand natural wisdom in which are the angels of the ultimate [lowest] heaven andalso men. CL 32921 Deep within, the spirit is composed of ever finer gradations.The finer and more sensitive the quality of spirit becomes, the higher thevibration within. This is felt as a discretely more wonderful purer sensationwithin, called joy. Heavenly joy itself, such as it is in its essence, cannot bedescribed, because it is in the inmost of the life of the angels ... it is as ifthe interiors were fully opened and unloosed for the reception of delight andblessedness, which are distributed to every least fibre and thus through thewhole. Thus the perception and sensation of this joy is so great as to be beyonddescription. For that which starts from the inmosts flows into every particularderived from the inmosts, propogating itself always with increase towards theexteriors. HH 409 The joy of the angels is from love to the Lord and fromcharity to the neighbour — that is, when they are in the use of performingthings of love and charity — and that in these there is so great a joy andhappiness as to be quite inexpressible . . . heaven and the joy of heaven firstbegin in man when his regard for self dies out in the uses which he performs. AC55112 When I wished to transfer all my delight to another, a more interior andfuller delight continually flowed in in its place, and the more I wished this,the more flowed in; and this was perceived to be from the Lord. HH 413 [Joy] isthe delight of doing something which is of use to oneself and to others; and thedelight of use derives its essence from love, and its existence from wisdom. Thedelight of use springing from love by means of wisdom is the soul and life ofall heavenly joys. In the heavens there are most cheerful companionships, whichexhilarate the minds of the angels, are pleasing to their minds, delight theirbreasts and recreate their bodies. But they enjoy these delights after they haveperformed the uses of their employments and occupations. From these uses comesthe soul and life in all their joys and pleasures, and if you take away thissoul or life, the accessory joys successively become joyless, becoming firstindifferent, then like trifles, and finally112 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS sad and distressing. CL 53 4 Externalparadisal delights are merely delights of the senses of the body, but internalparadisal delights are delights of the affections of the soul. Unless theselatter are present in the former there is no heavenly life in them, because nosoul, and without its corresponding soul, every delight gradually grows feebleand torpid and wearies the mind more than labour. In the heavens there areparadisal gardens everywhere, and angels derive joy from them, this joy being ajoy to them so far as the delight of the soul is within it. CL 8* Sorrow Withouta capacity to feel sorrow there could be no experience of joy — it would gounrecognized- Hence sorrow is also part of the angelic experience. The angelsare in sorrow about the darkness of earth. They say that hardly anywhere do theysee light, and that men seize upon fallacies, confirm them, and by this meansmultiply falsities upon falsities. . . the angels specially lament overconfirmations about faith separate from charity and justification thereby. Theyalso lament men's ideas about God, angels, and spirits, and about theirignorance of what love and wisdom are. DLW 188 When angels are in their propriumthey begin to be sad . . . But they said that they hoped soon to return to theirformer state, and thus, as it were into heaven again. For to them it is heavento be withheld from their proprium. HH 160 Perception For Swedenborg, perceptionis to be able to see through the ego's veil of illusion, to the reality within.Angels perceive that they live from the Lord, and yet when not reflecting on thematter they have no other idea than that they live from themselves. But there isa universal affection by which they sense that a change has taken place whenthey retreat only slightly from the good that stems from love, or from the truthof faith. Consequently they experience a peace and happiness that isindescribable when theANGELIC NATURE 113 general perception exists with them that they live from theLord. AC 1552 Inmost angels perceive how much comes from the Lord and how muchfrom themselves, but that in so far as it comes from the Lord they knowhappiness and in so far as it comes from themselves they do not. AC 2882 Thosewho are in heaven have more exquisite senses, that is, a keener sight andhearing ... the light of heaven, since it is Divine truth, enables the eyes ofangels to perceive and distinguish the most minute things. Moreover, theirexternal sight corresponds to their internal sight or understanding; for withangels one sight so flows into the other as to act as one with it; and thisgives them their great keenness of vision. In like manner, their hearingcorresponds to their perception, which pertains both to the understanding and tothe will, and in consequence they perceive in the tone and words of one speakingthe most minute things of his affection and thought; in the tone the thingspertaining to his affection, and in the words the things pertaining to histhought. But the rest of the senses with the angels are less exquisite than thesenses of seeing and hearing, for the reason that seeing and hearing serve theirintelligence and wisdom, but the rest do not; and if the other senses wereequally exquisite they would detract from the light and joy of their wisdom, andwould let in the delight of pleasures pertaining to various appetites and to thebody; and so far as these prevail they obscure and weaken the understanding.HH462a2 In every object those in the inmost heaven see what is Divine; theobjects they see indeed with their eyes; but the corresponding Divine thingsflow in immediately into their minds and fill them with a blessedness thataffects all their sensations. Thus before their eyes all things seem to laugh,to play, and to live. HH 489} Attitude The key to the angelic attitude is tolook only for the good and love in those you encounter. You are in heaven withinonly when you are seeking or finding heaven outside. People in whom charity ispresent think nothing else than good of the neighbour and speak nothing butgood, and this not for their114 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS own sake or that of him with whom they seekto curry favour, but from the Lord thus at work within charity . . . They arelike angels, residing with someone . . . Angels stir up nothing but what is goodand truth; and things that are evil and false they excuse. AC 1088 Angels areprotecting man constantly and are warding off the evils that evil spirits directagainst them. They protect even the falsities and the evils with a person, forthey are fully aware of where the person's falsities and evils come from — fromevil spirits and genii. AC 761 Those . . . who are as the angels, are desirousthat, if it were possible, their minds should be open, and that what they thinkmight be clearly manifest to everyone; for they intend nothing but good towardsthe neighbour, and if they see evil in anyone they excuse it. AC 6655 Power Aswe might expect, in the spiritual world angels have great power. Any obstruction[in the spiritual world] that ought to be removed because it is contrary toDivine order the angels cast down or overthrow merely by an effort of the willor a look. Thus I have seen mountains that were occupied by the evil cast downand overthrown, and sometimes shaken from end to end as in earthquakes. HH 229When an evil spirit is merely looked at by the angels he falls into a swoon. HH232 Angels. . . have the power of restraining evil spirits. . . . They exercisetheir power chiefly when with man, in defending him at times against many hells,and this in thousands of ways. AC 63444 Yet they are deeply aware that none ofthis power belongs to them. One single angel is more powerful than ten thousandsof spirits in hell, yet not so from himself but from the Lord. And he has thatpower from the Lord in the measure that he believes he can achieve nothing fromhimself and is accordingly the least. And he is able to have such a belief inthe measure that humility and an affection for serving others exist in him, thatis, in so far as the good that is essentially love to the Lord and charitytowards the neighbour is present in him. AC 3417\"ANGELIC NATURE 115 He is most powerful who believes, wills, and perceives thatall power is from the Lord, and none from himself and thus that those who arepowers in heaven are utterly averse to all self derived power. AC 542S1 Theangels have no power whatever of themselves, but all their power is from theLord; and they are powers only so far as they acknowledge this. Whoever amongthem believes that he has power of himself instantly becomes so weak as not tobe able to resist even a single evil spirit. For this reason angels ascribe nomerit whatever to themselves, and are averse to all praise and glory on accountof anything they do, ascribing it to the Lord. HH 230 , Angelic power, however,is of a very different nature to the worldly idea of power. Spiritual power isto will the good of another and, in so far as one can, to want to transfer intohim that which is in ourselves. AE 792 Harmony and Unanimity The importance ofhaving the freedom to be yourself — your true self — is strongly implied in thefollowing teachings. Harmony is not a result of sameness or duplication but ofvariety. The angelic heaven, which coheres together as a one, consists ininfinite variety, no one there being absolutely like another, either as to souland mind or as to affections, perceptions, and thoughts therefrom or as toinclinations and intentions therefrom, or as to the tone of the voice, as to theface, body, gesture, walk, and many other things. And yet, though there aremyriads and myriads, they have been and are being arranged by the Lord into asingle form in which there is complete unanimity and concord. This would not bepossible unless all the angels, being so various, were led universally andindividually by One. CL 324 Blessedness consists in unanimity and harmony, sothat many, even very many, suppose themselves to be one ... for from the harmonyof many there exists a One from which there is blessedness and happiness. Andfrom the concord of happiness, the happiness is doubled and trebled. SD 2899 SPIRITUAL WORLD The spiritual world is essentially the world of affection andthought. Yet it manifests before the eyes of the spirit in its owncorrespondential forms, presenting a world that is experienced by the senses ofthe spiritual body. Swedenborg stresses the apparent solidity and greaterreality of this visible and sensible world, which is a perfect mirror of thecurrent state of the spirit experiencing it. The representations that occur inthe next life are appearances. But they are living representations because theycome from the light of life. The light of life is Divine Wisdom, which isreceived from the Lord alone. Consequently all things that come into being fromthat light, unlike those from the light of the world, are real. For this reasonpeople in the next life have said several times that the things they behold inthat world are real, whereas those that man beholds are by contrast not real.The reason for this is that the former are living and so have a direct influenceon their life, whereas the latter are not living and so have no direct influenceon their life, except in so far as things with them belonging to the light ofthe world join themselves appropriately and by correspondence to those belongingto the light of heaven. AC 3485 Walkings, goings, and departures are nothingelse but changes of the state of the interiors; but still, before the eyes ofthe spirits and angels, they appear exactly like walkings, goings, anddepartures . . . those appearances are so real that the spirits are altogetherunaware that they are from that origin; nor are they willing to know that theyare thence; and the angels of heaven know, indeed, but do not talk about it.This is of the Lord's Divine Providence, in order that everyone may seem tohimself to live and act from himself. SD 5646SPIRITUAL WORLD 117 The things which exist in the spiritual are even more realthan those in the natural world; for that which in nature is added to thespiritual is dead, and does not produce reality, but diminishes it. AE 1218* Thespirit person rejoices in every sense, both external and internal, that heenjoyed in the world; he sees as before, he hears and speaks as before, smellsand tastes, and when touched, he feels the touch as before; he also strives,desires, longs for, thinks, reflects, is affected, loves, wills, as before; andone who is delighted with studies reads and writes as before. In a word when aman passes from one life into the other, or from one world into the other, it islike passing from one place into another, carrying with him all things that hepossesses in himself as a man; so that it cannot be said that after death, whichis only the death of the earthly body, the man will have lost anything of hisown. HH 4612 In general, whatever appears in heaven is wholly similar to whatexists in our material world in its three kingdoms. . . Gold, silver, copper,tin, lead, stones precious and not precious, ground, earth, mountains, hills,valleys, waters, fountains, and other things pertaining to the mineral kingdomappear there. Parks, gardens, forests, fruit trees of every kind, lawns,cornfields, plains full of flowers, herbs, and grasses of every kind appearthere; also things derived from them, as oils, wines, all kinds of juices, andother things belonging to the vegetable kingdom. Animals of the earth, fowls ofthe heaven, fishes of the sea, reptiles, and these of every kind, appear there;and they are so much like those on our earth that they cannot be distinguished.I have seen them, and could not perceive any difference. But still there is thisdifference, that the things that appear in heaven are from a spiritual origin;while those in our world are from a material origin. AE 926 Threefold DivisionThree main divisions of the spiritual world may be distinguished — a beautifularea mirroring the heavenly inner spirit (heaven), an ugly area mirroring thehellish inner spirit (hell), and a mediate region (world of spirits) mirroringthe natural outer spirit (within which either or both heaven and hell may beactive). The spiritual world consists of heaven and hell; heaven is overhead andhell there is underfoot, not in the centre of the globe which men118 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS inhabit, but under the countries in thespiritual world. These are spiritual in origin, and consequently are notextended in space, but only have the appearance of being so extended. Betweenheaven and hell is a great intervening region, which to those who are thereseems like a complete world . . . Every man as to his spirit is in the midst ofthis region, solely in order that he may possess free will. Because this regionis so vast, and appears to those who are there like a great globe, it is calledthe world of spirits . . . There is no purgatory in the world of spirits: TCR4752'A Between heaven and hell there is an intermediate place, which is calledthe world of spirits. To this comes everyone immediately after death; and herespirits have interaction with one another similar to the interaction which menhave with each other upon earth. DF 63* Every man after death comes first of allinto the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and therepasses his times, that is, his states, and according to his life is preparedeither for heaven or for hell. So long as he remains in that world, he is calleda spirit. He who has been raised up from that world into heaven, is called anangel, but he who has been cast down into hell is called a satan or a devil.While these are in the world of spirits, he who is being prepared for heaven iscalled an angelic spirit, but he who is being prepared for hell, an infernalspirit. In the meantime, the angelic spirit is conjoined with heaven, and theinfernal spirit with hell. All spirits who are in the world of spirits areadjoined to men, because men as to the interiors of the mind are in like mannerbetween heaven and hell and, through these spirits, communicate with heaven orwith hell according to their life. It ought to be known that the world ofspirits is one thing and the spiritual world another. The world of spirits isthat which has just been spoken of; but the spiritual world includes that worldas well as heaven and hell. DLW 140 All in the spiritual world have theirdwellings in certain quarters. In the east are those who are in good from theLord, for the Sun is there, in the centre of which is the Lord. In the north arethose who are in ignorance; in the south, those who are in intelligence; and inthe west, those who are in evil. A man is kept in this intervening or middleregion between heaven and hell not as to his body, but as to his spirit; and ashis spirit changes its state, by drawing near to good or evil,SPIRITUAL WORLD 119 it is transferred to a place or situation in one or other ofthe quarters, and enters the company of those who dwell there. It should beknown, however, that the Lord does not transfer the man to this place or that,but the man himself effects the change. TCR 476 After death every man betakeshimself to his own in that region, and associates with those whose love issimilar to his own; for love unites everyone there with those like him, andenables him to breathe freely and to continue in the state of his former life.Gradually, however, the spirit is divested of externals which do not accord withits internals; and when this is done, the good are taken up into heaven, and theevil betake themselves to hell, each to the company of those with whom he isunited as to his ruling love. TCR 477 Initial Entrance Swedenborg describes howhe first experienced the spiritual world as if he had died and awakened in theworld of spirits. It is interesting to note the striking parallels with morerecently reported accounts of near death experiences. I was brought into acondition of unconsciousness as far as my physical senses were concerned —practically, that is, into the condition of people who are dying. However, mymore inward life, including thought, remained unimpaired so that I perceived andremembered the things that happened, the things that do happen to people who areawakened from the dead. I noticed that physical breathing was almost taken away;the more inward breathing of the spirit kept on, joined to a slight and stillbreathing of the body. Next, a communication was set up between my heart beatand the celestial kingdom (since that kingdom corresponds to the heart in man).I even saw angels from there, some at a distance; and two of them were sittingby my head. This resulted in the removal of all my personal affections, althoughthought and perception continued. I was in this condition for several hours.Then the spirits who were around me left, declaring that I was dead . . . Theangels who sat by my head were silent, only their thoughts communicating withmine. When these thoughts are accepted, the angels know that the person's spiritis in a condition to be led out of his body ... I did perceive that the angelsfirst tried to discover what my thinking was, whether it120 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS was like the thinking of people who die,which is normally about eternal life . . . Especially, I was allowed to perceiveand feel that there was a pulling, a kind of drawing of the more inward elementsof my mind — hence of my spirit — out of my body. I was told that this is doneby the Lord, and is the source of resurrection. When celestial angels are withsomeone who has been awakened, they do not leave him; for they love each andevery one. But when the spirit is the kind who cannot be in fellowship withcelestial angels any longer, then he wants to get away from them. When thishappens, angels from the Lord's spiritual kingdom come, through whom the spiritis granted the benefit of light ... I was shown how this happens, too. Thoseangels seemed in a way to roll back a covering of the left eye toward the bridgeof the nose, so that the eye was opened and enabled to see. . . Once thiscovering seems to have been rolled back, something bright but hazy is visible,rather like what a person sees through half opened eyelids when he first wakesup. At this point, the bright hazy something seemed to me to be of a heavenlycolour; but then I was told that this varies. After this, I felt something beingsoftly rolled off my face, which brought about spiritual thought. This rollingoff from the face is an appearance as well, serving to depict that the personhas come from natural thought into spiritual thought. The angels take thegreatest possible care to prevent the emergence of any concept from the awakenedperson unless it savours of love. Then they tell him that he is a spirit. Afterthe benefit of life has been given, the spiritual angels offer the new spiritevery service he could ever wish in that condition and teach him about thethings that exist in the other life, but only as he can comprehend them. If heis not the kind who is willing to be taught, the person who has been awakenedcraves release from the fellowship of these angels. Still it is not the angelswho leave him; it is he who estranges himself from them . . . When a spirit hasthus estranged himself, he is taken away by good spirits, who offer him allkinds of help as long as he is in fellowship with them. But if his life in theworld was of a kind to make fellowship with good spirits impossible, then hecraves release from them as well. This happens as long and as often asnecessary, until he joins the kind of spirits who wholly fit in with his life inthe world, among whom he finds his kind of life. HH 449, 450 When a man arrivesafter death in the spiritual world, which generallySPIRITUAL WORLD 121 happens on the third day after he has breathed his last, heseems to himself to be alive as he was in the world, living in a similar house,room and bedroom, with similar dress and clothes, and with similar companions athome . . . The reason this happens to every person after death is so that deathshould not seem like death but a continuation of life, and so that the last actof natural life should become the first of spiritual life; and from this heshould advance towards his goal, which maybe either in heaven or in hell. Thereason the recently dead find this likeness in everything is that their mindsremain exactly as they were in the world; and because the mind is not confinedto the head but pervades the whole body, it has a similar body, for the body isan organ of the mind and runs without a break from the head. The mind istherefore the man himself, but he is then not a material but a spiritual man;and because after death he is the same man, he is presented in accordance withthe concepts in his mind with things similar to those he possessed at home inthe world. But this lasts only a few days . . . When newcomers to the spiritualworld are in this first state, angels come to them to bid them welcome, and atfirst are much pleased at this conversation with them, since they know thattheir thoughts are then no different from what they were when still living inthe former world. STW 163 Everyone in the spiritual world drops his baptismalname, and the name of his family, and is named according to his quality. Itw 41Judgment Swedenborg describes in general terms the changes that will ensue afternewly arrived spirits have completed the first stage and the judgment processcommences. The process of judgment is, as perceived and experienced bySwedenborg, an internal one — that is to say, one judges oneself with the aid ofthe light of truth from within. For the hardened wicked this process is anextremely painful one which they would avoid at all costs by fleeing if theycould, from the light of truth into spiritual darkness. Once the first conditionhas been gone through (the condition of relatively outward concerns), the spiritperson is directed into a condition of his more inward concerns, or a conditionof his more inward intention and consequent thought — the condition in which hewas involved in the world when he was left to himself, in freedom,122 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS and let loose the reins of his thought. Heslips unconsciously into this condition when (as he did in the world) he pullsin the thought nearest his speech, or the thought that gives rise to his speech,toward his more inward thought, and remains involved in this latter. A spirit inthis condition is thinking on the basis of his intention, which means he isthinking from his very own affection of love whatever love it may be, good orselfish. At this point his thinking makes a unity with his intention — such aunity, in fact, that he hardly seems to be thinking at all, simply intending.When spirits are in this second condition they come to look just the same asthey were intrinsically in the world, and the things they had done and saidprivately are exposed. For since external factors are not controlling at thispoint, they say openly and try to do similar things without being afraid fortheir reputation as they were in the world. They are also then brought into manyconditions of their evils, so that they may appear to angels and good spirits asthey really are. While evil spirits are in this second condition, it is normalfor them to be punished often and severely because they plunge into all kinds ofevil. There are many kinds of punishment in the world of spirits, and there isno favouritism, whether the person was a king or a slave in the world.Everything evil brings its own penalty with it. The two are bonded together. Sothe person who is involved in something evil is also involved in the penalty ofthe evil. Yet no one there suffers a penalty because of evils that he did in theworld, but rather because of evil things he is doing currently. The reason forthis punishment is that the fear of punishment is the only means of controllingevil things in this condition. Encouragement no longer works; neither doesteaching or the fear of law and reputation, because the person's behaviour nowstems from his nature, which cannot be controlled or broken except by means ofpunishment. Good spirits though are not punished at all, even if they did evilthings in the world, because their evils do not come back. A separation of evilspirits from good spirits occurs in the course of this second condition; forduring the first condition they were together . . . The separation of the goodfrom the evil happens in various ways. Broadly, it happens by taking the evilones around to those communities they were in touch with through their goodthoughts and affections during their first condition. In this way, theySPIRITUAL WORLD 123 are taken to those communities which were persuaded by theiroutward appearance, that these spirits were not evil. Normally they are taken onan extensive circuit, and everywhere are exposed as they really are to goodspirits. On seeing them, the good spirits turn away; and as they turn away, theevil spirits who are being taken around also turn their faces away from the goodones toward the region where the hellish community is which is theirdestination. The third condition of a person or of his spirit after death is acondition of instruction. This condition is proper to people who are enteringheaven and becoming angels, but not for people who are entering hell, since theycannot be taught. No one can be prepared for heaven except by means of insightsinto what is true and good — that is by means of instruction. This is because noone can know what is good and true on the spiritual level, or what is evil andfalse, unless he is taught. The work of instruction is done by angels of manycommunities . . . The places where the instruction occurs are in the north, andare varied, arranged and set off according to the genera and species of theirheavenly good qualities so that each and every individual can be taught asbefits his own intrinsic character and his capacity to receive ... To theseplaces, the Lord brings the good spirits who are to be taught after their secondcondition in the world of spirits has been completed. This however does notapply to everyone, because people who have been taught in the world have alreadybeen prepared there for heaven by the Lord, and are brought into heaven byanother route. Some are brought in immediately after death. Some are brought inafter a brief stay with good spirits, where the cruder elements of their thoughtand affections are set aside, which they drew from matters of prestige andwealth in the world, which removal purifies them. Some are desolated first,which takes place in the area called 'the Lower Earth'. Some people have harshexperiences there. They are the people who have settled themselves in falsenotions but have still led good lives. For false notions cling tenaciously; andtrue matters cannot be seen, and therefore cannot be accepted, until the falsenotions are shattered. Once spirits have been made ready for heaven by teachingin the places mentioned above . . . they are dressed in angelic clothes, most ofwhich are white like linen. So dressed, they are brought to a path124 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS that heads up towards heaven and arecommitted to angel guardians there. Then they are accepted by some other angelsand introduced into communities, and there into many forms of happiness. HH 502,503, 507, 509, 511, 512, 513, 519 Appearances in Heaven Whatever appears in thespiritual world is a representation or correspondence of the spiritual state ofthe observer. All spirits who are in a state of inner peace, harmony, and desireto co-operate, appear therefore in peaceful, harmonious, and co-operativecommunities which form the heavens. Their groupings reflect the similarity oftheir spiritual condition, or, as one of the great universal spiritual laws iscommonly expressed, 'like attracts like'. The angels of any one heaven are nottogether in one place, but are divided into larger and smaller societies inaccordance with the differences of the good of love and faith in which they are,those who are in like good forming one society. HH 41 All who form one angelicsociety resemble one another in countenance in a general way but not inparticulars. HH 41 In the heavens, there are larger and smaller societies. Thelarger ones consist of myriads of angels, the smaller of some thousands, and theleast of some hundreds. There are also some who dwell alone, house by house, asit were, and family by family. Although these live in this scattered way, theyare arranged in order like those who live in societies, namely, the wiser in themiddle and the more simple in the boundaries. HH 50 All manner of things are tobe seen and experienced in heaven, but again all appear only because they are areflection of the angels' inner state. The nature of the objects that arevisible to angels in the heavens. . . are like things on earth but more perfectin form and more abundant in number. HH 111 In the heavens, all things come intoexistence from the Lord in accordance with their correspondences with theinteriors of the angels. HH 113 Since all things that correspond to interiorsalso represent them, they are therefore called representatives, and because theyare varied inSPIRITUAL WORLD 125 accordance with the state of the interiors of the angels,they are also called appearances. Nevertheless the things that appear before theeyes of the angels in the heavens and are perceived by their senses, appear andare perceived just as true to life as do things on earth to men, nay rather,much more clearly, distinctly and perceptibly. Appearances of this kind inheaven are called real appearances, because they have real existence.Appearances that are not real also occur, which are such as do appear but do notcorrespond to interiors. HH 175 The garments with which the angels are clothed .. . correspond to their intelligence, and therefore, everyone in the heavens isseen clothed in accordance with his intelligence, and because one excels anotherin intelligence so the garments of one surpass those of another. The mostintelligent have garments that glitter as if with flame, others have garmentsthat shine as if with light. The less intelligent have garments shining andwhite without the effulgence, and the still less intelligent have garments ofvarious colours. But the angels of the inmost heaven are naked. HH 178 Theangels have dwellings and these differ in accordance with each one's state oflife. They are magnificent for those in a higher state of dignity and lessmagnificent for those in a lower state. HH 183 Their dwellings are preciselylike the dwellings on earth which are called houses, but more beautiful. In themare chambers, inner rooms, and bedrooms in great number. There are also courtsand around them gardens, flower beds, and lawns. Where they live in societiestheir houses are near each other, one alongside another, arranged in the form ofa city, with streets, roads, and public squares exactly like the cities on ourearth. HH 184 I have seen the palaces of heaven which were so magnificent thatthey cannot be described. Above, they glittered as if made of pure gold, andbelow, as if made of precious stones . . . On the side looking to the souththere were parks where, too, everything shone, in some places the leavesglistened as if made of silver, and the fruit as if made of gold, while theflowers in their beds formed as it were rainbows with their colours. HH 185 Theangels of whom the Lord's celestial kingdom consists dwell for the most part inelevated places that appear as mountains rising from126 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS the ground. The angels of whom the Lord'sspiritual kingdom consists dwell in less elevated places that appear like hills,while the angels who are in the lowest parts of heaven dwell in places thatappear like rocks of stone. HH 188 The Lord is seen as a Sun, not in heaven, buthigh above the heavens, and not directly overhead or in the zenith but beforethe faces of the angels at a middle height . . . He is seen in one way by thosewho receive Him with the good of love, and in another by those who receive Himwith the good of faith. Those who receive Him with the good of love see Him as asun, fiery and flaming, in accordance with the reception. These are in Hiscelestial kingdom. Those who receive Him with the good of faith see Him as amoon, white and gleaming in accordance with the reception. These are in Hisspiritual kingdom. HH 121 Appearances in Hell The situation in the hells is notso simple as in the case of the heavens, where the true light always revealsforms of reality. In the hells there is from the false light of the ego adelusion of self wisdom, which prevents the reality of utter blackness,ugliness, and devastation from appearing — unless the light of heaven breaksthrough at any time — which, for the sake of those in that condition, is notoften. The hells are everywhere both under the mountains, hills, and rocks, andunder the plains and valleys. The openings or gates to the hells that are underthe mountains, hills, and rocks, appear to the sight like holes and clefts inthe rocks, some extended and wide, and some straightened and narrow, and many ofthem rugged. They all, when looked into, appear dark and dusky; but the infernalspirits who are in them are in such a luminosity as arises from burning coals.Their eyes are adapted to the reception of that light, and for the reason thatwhile they lived in the world they were in thick darkness as to Divine truths,because of their denying them, and were in a sort of light as to falsitiesbecause of their affirming them. HH 584 The openings or gates to the hells thatare beneath the plains and valleys present to the sight different appearances.Some resemble those that are beneath the mountains hills and rocks; someresemble dens and caverns, some great chasms and whirlpools; some resemble bogs,SPIRITUAL WORLD 127 and some standing water. They are all covered over, and donot open except when evil spirits from the world of spirits are cast in hither;and when they open they burst forth from them either something like the fire andsmoke that is seen in the air from burning buildings, or like a flame withoutsmoke, or like soot such as comes from a burning chimney, or like a mist andthick cloud . . . The infernal spirits neither see nor feel these things,because when they are in them they are as in their own atmosphere, and thus inthe delight of their life; and this for the reason that these things correspondto the evils and falsities in which they are, namely, fire corresponding tohatred and revenge, smoke and soot to the falsities therefrom, flame to theevils of the love of self, and a mist or thick cloud to falsities from thatlove. HH 585 This infernal fire or heat is changed into intense cold when heatfrom heaven inflows; and then those who are in it shiver like those seized witha chilling fever, and are also inwardly distressed; and for the reason that theyare in direct opposition to the Divine; and the heat of heaven, which is DivineLove, extinguishes the heat of hell, which is the love of self, and with it thefire of their life; and this is the cause of such cold and consequent shiveringand distress. This is accompanied by thick darkness, resulting in folly andblindness. But this rarely happens, and only when outbreaks that have increasedbeyond measure need to be repressed. HH 512 When a spirit of his own accord andfrom his freedom drifts towards his hell and enters it, he is received at firstin a friendly manner, which makes him believe that he has come among friends.But this continues for a few hours only. In the meanwhile he is explored inrespect of his astuteness and consequent ability; and when this has been donethey begin to infest him, and this by various methods, and with graduallygreater severity and vehemence. This is accomplished by introducing him moreinteriorly and deeply into hell; for the more interior and deeper the hell themore malignant are the spirits. After these infestations, they begin to treathim cruelly by punishments, and this goes on until he is reduced to thecondition of a slave. But rebellious movements are continually springing upthere, since everyone wishes to be greatest, and burns with hatred against theothers; and in consequence new uprisings occur, and thus one scene is changed128 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS into another, and those who are made slavesare delivered that they may assist some new devil to subjugate others; and againthose who refuse to submit and render implicit obedience are tormented invarious ways; and so on continually. Such torments are the torments of hell,which are called hell fire. HH 574 Destiny Since every soul has been uniquelycreated to become a special part of the Grand Man, everyone has a predeterminedimportance. A man may refuse it, foolishly, but it is heaven to accept and hellto refuse it. A knowledge of the means by which a man may be saved, or thepower, is not wanting to anyone if he desires to be saved. From this it followsthat all are predestined to heaven, and no one to hell. DP 3293 The Divine Loveis in every man, both the wicked and the good; consequently the Lord who isDivine Love cannot act otherwise than as a father on earth acts towards hischildren, and infinitely more so, because the Divine Love is infinite; and alsoHe cannot withdraw from anyone because the life of everyone is derived from Him.He appears to withdraw from the wicked; but it is the wicked who withdraw, whileHe from love still leads them . . . The means of salvation have been providedfor everyone, and heaven is such that all who live well, of whatever religionthey may be, have a place there . . . Those who are born outside the church aremen as well as those born within it, being of the same heavenly origin, and areequally living and immortal souls. They also have a form of religion from whichthey acknowledge that there is a God, and that they ought to live well; and hewho acknowledges God and lives well becomes spiritual in his own degree and issaved . . . Salvation does not come to anyone because the Lord is known to him,but because he lives according to the Lord's commandments; and the Lord is knownto everyone who acknowledges God, for the Lord is the God of heaven and earth.DP 3302'6 Children in Heaven Some of Swedenborg's most beautiful and comfortingteachings emerge from his spiritual experience concerning children in heaven.Little children who die are just as much little children in the otherSPIRITUAL WORLD 129 life, having a like infantile mind, a like innocence inignorance, and a like tenderness in all things. They are merely in the rudimentsof a capacity to become angels, for little children are not angels but becomeangels. For everyone passing out of this world is in a state like that of hislife, a little child in the state of a little child, a boy in the state of aboy, a youth, a man, or an old man; but subsequently each one's state ischanged. HH 330 The state of little children in the other life far surpassestheir state in the world, for they are not clothed with an earthly body, butwith one like that of an angel. HH 331 As soon as little children areresuscitated, which takes place immediately after death, they are taken intoheaven and confided to angel women who, in the life of their body, tenderlyloved little children and at the same time loved God. Because these during theirlife in the world loved all children with a kind of motherly tenderness, theyreceive them as their own; while the children, from an implanted disposition,love them as their own mothers. There are as many children in each one's care asshe desires from a spiritual parental affection. HH 332 However, since evenchildren must have ego, like everyone, then even in the other world they arestill inclined to desire and act for themselves alone in isolation, whichSwedenborg defines as evil. [Children] are equally in evil, and in fact are alsonothing but evil; but, like all angels, they are so withheld from evil and heldin good by the Lord as to seem to themselves to be in good from themselves. Forthis reason, when little children have become adults in heaven, in order thatthey may not have the false idea about themselves that the good pertaining tothem is from themselves and not from the Lord, they are now and then let downinto their evils which they inherited, and are left in them until they know,acknowledge, and believe the truth of the matter. HH 342 It is intelligence andwisdom that make an angel, and as long as little children do not possess thesethey are not angels, although they are with the angels; but as soon as theybecome intelligent and wise they become angels. Indeed, I have marvelled thatthey do not then appear as little children, but as adults, for they are nolonger of an infantile genius, but of a more mature angelic genius. Intelligenceand wisdom bring this about. The reason little children appear more mature, thus130 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS as youths and young men, as they areperfected in intelligence and wisdom, is that intelligence and wisdom areessential spiritual nourishment. . . but it should be known that in heavenlittle children advance in age only to early manhood, and remain in this toeternity. HH 430 Grand Man (Universal Human) In the details of the nature of theGrand Man the influence of Swedenborg's earlier physiological studies andanticipations can be seen more than anywhere else in his spiritual teachings.The whole concept is surely one of the grandest, most all-embracing andsignificant of spiritual visions. That heaven in its whole complex resembles oneMan is an arcanum not yet known in the world, but it is very well known in theheavens. To know this and the specific and particular things relating to it, isthe chief thing in the intelligence of the angels there . . . since they knowthat all the heavens with their societies resemble one Man they therefore callheaven the Grand and Divine Man — Divine because it is the Divine of the Lordthat makes heaven. HH 59 All human beings throughout the whole world have aposition either in the Grand Man, that is, in heaven, or outside it in hell.They have that position as to their souls, or what amounts to the same, as tothe spirit which will continue to live after death of the body. As long as he isliving in the world, no one is actually conscious of being there in heaven or inhell, but all the same he is there and is governed from there. AC 3644 In thehead of the Grand Man, which is heaven, are those who are in love to the Lordfrom the Lord, and these are called celestial; but in the body from the breasteven to the loins of that Grand Man which is heaven, are those who are in lovetowards the neighbour, and they are called spiritual. But in the feet of theGrand Man, which is heaven, are those who are in the faith of charity obscurely,and these are called natural. AE 708 The church also on earth is before the Lordas one Man, that it is also divided into societies, and that each society is aMan; and further, that all who are included within that Man are within heaven,but those who are outside of it are in hell. The reason again of this has beenstated, that every man belonging to the church is also an angelSPIRITUAL WORLD 131 of heaven, for he becomes an angel after death. The churchmoreover on earth, together with the angels, forms not only the interiors ofthis Man, but also the exteriors, which are called cartilaginous and bony. Thechurch forms this, because men on earth are endued with a body, in which theultimate spiritual is clothed with the natural, and it is this that constitutesthe conjunction of heaven with the church, and of the church with heaven. AE12223 In heaven there is one single influx which is received by every individualaccording to his own disposition . . . and although there is one influx only,everything nevertheless confirms and follows as one. And this comes aboutthrough the mutual love shared by those in heaven. AC 12852 A form makes a onethe more perfectly in proportion as the things which enter into the form aredistinctly different and yet united. DP 44 But what of those spirits who intheir freedom have not chosen the heavenly path? In the Lord's sight the entirehuman race is as one Man . . . not that men themselves collectively appear inthis manner, but the uses which they perform. Those appear collectively as aperfect and beautiful Man whose uses are good uses, that is, those who performthem from the Lord . . . Those, on the other hand, who perform uses not for thesake of uses, but for the sake of themselves or the world only, also appearbefore the Lord as one Man, but as a man imperfect and deformed. It is evidentfrom these things that the Lord regards the men of the world individually fromuse, and collectively from uses co-ordinated into the form of Man. By uses aremeant the uses of every function pertaining to a man's office pursuit andemployment. These uses are good works themselves in the sight of the Lord. Thosein kingdoms who love the uses of their office because they are uses, appearcollectively as a man-angel; while those who love the uses of their office forthe sake only of pleasures, separated from uses, appear collectively as aMan-devil. Those merchants who love business and wealth for the sake ofbusiness, and at the same time look to God, are in the Man- angel. But thosemerchants who love wealth and business for the sake of those alone, are in theMan-devil. DL vii10 SEXUALITY AND THE CONJUGIAL RELATIONSHIP Though Swedenborg never married,there is ample evidence in his journals that he did enjoy female company and hada great understanding and appreciation of feminine qualities and attributes. HisJournal of Dreams, as well as his physiological works show that he could discusssexual experience, when appropriate, in a frank and open manner. Yet the deepinsights he is able to offer into the distinctive nature of masculine andfeminine qualities are not derived from his natural experience, but fromextrapolation of his perception of the fundamentals and origin of the sexes. Howthe distinctive — yet wholly complementary aspects of masculine and feminineinterrelate and interact reciprocally from their Divine origin, throughout lifeand within the marriage relationship — as well as what happens when thesequalities are distorted — is described by Swedenborg in his major work,Conjugial Love. Once again, Swedenborg's vision is the precursor of a morerecent discovery of modern neurology and psychology — that the brain's two lobesor hemispheres are respectively associated with two very distinctive ways ofperceiving the world by the mind. Although not apparently directly linked withthe subject of sex, we shall look first at this phenomenon. Left and Right BrainCharacteristics One of the striking things Swedenborg noticed in hisphysiological studies, was the separation of the brain into two distinct thoughconnected halves. At the psychological level he saw these corresponding to thewill and understanding of the mind and at the spiritual level to love andwisdom. Love is the holistic underlying invisible dynamic of reality, whilstwisdom is the awareness of love perceived through its effects. At a lower levelof the spirit, wisdom appears in a corresponding lower form as truth perceivedintellectually, or the understanding of truth. The right side of the brain isthe bed or receptacle of love and the left the bed or receptacle of wisdom. DWiii4SEXUALITY/CONJUGIAL RELATIONSHIP 133 To the brain's left hemisphere belong theintellectual faculties, and to the right those of the will AC 644 The left sideof the brain corresponds to rational or intellectual things, but the right tothe affections or things of the will. AC 3884 Those who correspond to the rightside of the brain are those who are in the will of good and thereby in the willof truth. Those who correspond to the left side of the brain are those who arein the understanding of good and truth and thereby in the affection of them. AC4052 Distinctive Nature of the Sexes While Swedenborg does not make the linkexplicitly, there is a correlation between his distinction between the two brainlobe functions and the two sexes. He sees the male mind as overtly more 'leftbrain' (intellectual) and the female mind as overtly more 'right brain'(intuitive). The affection of the male... is an affection of learning,understanding, and being wise — the affection of learning in boyhood, theaffection of understanding in adolescence and early manhood, and the affectionof being wise from this manhood to old age; from all of which, it is plain thathis nature or innate disposition inclines to the formation of an understanding;consequently, that he is born to become intellectual. But because this cannot beeffected except from love, therefore the Lord adjoins love to him according tohis reception, that is, according to his animus that he wishes to become wise.From his application, which is to such things as are intellectual or in whichthe understanding predominates, most of which are forensic and regard publicuses. From his ways, all of which partake of the predominence of theunderstanding. From this it is that the actions of his life, which are meant byways, are rational, or if not, he wishes them to seem so. Moreover masculinerationality is conspicuous in his every virtue. CL902^ In the male the inmost islove and its clothing wisdom, or, what is the same thing, he is love veiled overwith wisdom; and in the female, the inmost is that wisdom of the male, and itsclothing, the love therefrom. This love, however, is feminine love, and is givenby the Lord to the wife through the wisdom of her husband, while the former loveis masculine love, being the love of growing wise, and this is134 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS given by the Lord to the husband according tohis reception of wisdom. It is from this that the male is the wisdom of love andthe female the love of that wisdom. Therefore, from creation there is implantedin each the love of conjunction into a one. CL 32 It is masculine to perceivefrom the understanding, and feminine to perceive from love; and theunderstanding perceives things which are above the body and beyond the world, itbeing to these that rational and spiritual sight extends; while love does not gobeyond what it feels. When it does go beyond, it does this by drawing on thatconjunction with the male understanding which was established from creation; forunderstanding pertains to light, and love to heat, and that which pertains tolight is seen, while that which pertains to heat is felt. CL 168 The male isborn into the affection of knowing, understanding and becoming wise, and thefemale is born into the love of conjoining herself with that affection in themale. CL 33 The male is born to become the understanding and the female tobecome a will loving the understanding of the male; from which it follows, thatconjugial conjunction is a conjunction of the wife's will with the man'sunderstanding, and reciprocally of the man's understanding with the wife's will.CL 159 Origin of Conjugial Love In adding an 'i* to the old legal term,'conjugal', Swedenborg coined a new word — 'conjugial'. This is the word that heuses to describe the quality of love that unites a couple as one in heart andmind and life. The origin of love truly conjugial is the love of the Lordtowards the Church, whence the Lord is called, in the Word, the Bridegroom andHusband; and the Church, the Bride and Wife . . . The Lord's conjunction withthe man of the church is the conjunction of good and truth. From the Lord isgood, and with man is truth, hence the conjunction which is called the heavenlymarriage, from which marriage love truly conjugial exists between two marriedpartners, who are in such conjunction with the Lord . . . This conjunction orthis marriage was thus established from creation. The man was created to be anunderstanding of truth, and the woman to be anSEXUALITY/CONJUGIAL RELATIONSHIP 135 affection of good, consequently, the man isa truth, and the woman a good. When the understanding of truth, which is withthe man, makes one with the affection of good, which is with the woman, there isa conjunction of the two minds into one. This conjunction is the spiritualmarriage from which descends conjugial love. For when two minds are conjoined soas to be one mind, there is love between them; and this love, which is the loveof spiritual marriage, when it descends into the body, becomes the love ofnatural marriage. AE9832 Conjugial love is love towards one [member] of the[opposite] sex and with one. Love towards many and with many is a natural love,for man has it in common with beasts and birds, and these are natural; butconjugial love is a spiritual love and peculiar and proper to men, because menwere created and therefore born to become spiritual. CL 48 That all delightsfrom their first to their last are gathered into [conjugial love], is because ofthe excellence of its use above all other uses. Its use is the propogation ofthe human race, and thence of the angelic heavens; and because this use was theend of ends of creation, it followed that all the states of blessedness,happiness, delight, pleasantness, and pleasure which, by the Lord the Creator,could ever be conferred on man, are gathered into this his love. CL 682 Sincelove truly conjugial conjoins the souls and hearts of two, therefore it isunited with friendship and thereby with confidence, and makes both conjugial. CL334 The states of [conjugial love] are innocence, peace, tranquillity, inmostfriendship, full confidence, and a mutual desire of animus and heart to do tothe other every good; and from all these, blessedness, happiness, delight,pleasure; and from the eternal fruition of these, heavenly felicity ... thenature of love is such that it desires to be in communion with another whom itloves from the heart, yea, to confer joys on that other and therein to take itsown joys. Infinitely more is this true of the Divine Love which is in the Lord,in respect to man whom He created a receptacle of the love and wisdom proceedingfrom Himself. And because He created him for the reception of these — man forthe reception of wisdom, woman for the reception of the136 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS love of man's wisdom — therefore, from theirvery inmost, he infused into them conjugial love, that into this, andconsequently into those who are in love truly conjugial, these alone beingrecipients, He might gather all things blessed, happy, delightful, andpleasurable, which together with life, proceed and flow in solely from HisDivine Love through his Divine Wisdom. CL ISO True conjugial love is the unionof two persons as to the interior of the thought and the will, or of truth andgood; for truth pertains to thought and good belongs to the will. For he who hastrue conjugial love, loves what the other thinks, and what the other wills; thatis, he loves to think as the other thinks, and to will as the other wills,consequently to be united to the other, and to become one. AC 10169 [Conjugiallove] is the Lord's Divine in the heavens, which is Divine good and Divine truthso united in two persons that they are not as two but as one ... In heaven thetwo consorts are that love, since everybody is his own good and his own truthboth as to mind and body, the body being an image of the mind because it isformed after its likeness. . . The Divine is imaged in a pair who are in trulyconjugial love; and as the Divine is so imaged, so is heaven, because the entireheaven is Divine good and Divine truth going forth from the Lord; and this iswhy all things of heaven are inscribed on that love with blessings and delightbeyond number. HH 374 Conjugial love viewed in itself is a state of innocence;and this is why consorts who are in conjugial love enjoy heavenly delightstogether, which appear before their minds almost like the games of innocence, asbetween little children; for everything delights their minds, since heaven withits joy flows into every particular of their lives . . . The angels in heavenhave all their beauty from conjugial love. The affections and thought from thatlove are represented by diamonds like auras with scintillations as if from fierystones and rubies, which are attended by delights that affect the interiors ofthe mind. In a word, heaven represents itself in conjugial love, because heavenwith the angels is the conjunction of good and truth, and it is this conjunctionthat makes conjugial love. CL 382* Conjugial love is the fundamental of allmutual love. Mutual love is to wish better for another than for oneself; but thetie of conjugialSEXUALITY/CONJUGIAL RELATIONSHIP 137 love is still closer. One in that relationnot only experiences the highest felicity in giving himself up to his conjugialpartner, that their minds may be united as one, but this love is the love of theconservation of the whole human race; it is the Lord's mercy towards theuniversal human race which inflows into conjugial love, and thence into theconjugial love of married partners flows the love of procreating offspring, andthe love of offspring itself; and they are moreover so created that their mindsmay be more and more closely united. SD 4229 [Conjugial love] is the inmost ofall loves, and such that partner sees partner in animus and mind, so that eachpartner has the other in himself or herself, that is, that the image, nay, thelikeness of the husband is in the mind of the wife and the image and likeness ofthe wife is in the mind of the husband, so that one sees the other in himself,and they thus cohabit in their inmosts. SD 4408 Conjugial love of one man withone wife is the precious jewel of human life and the repository of the Christianreligion. CL 531 Union of Male and Female When relationship exists only at thenatural level it is subject to the ego's illusion that 'I am my body', andeveryone and everything exist as separate entities. At this level union isexpressed only through physical presence and contact. But in the conjugialrelationship, living in the eternal realms of spirit, the sense of uniondevelops at ever deeper levels of being. The souls and minds of men are not inspace as are their bodies; for from their origin . . . they are celestial andspiritual. And, not being in space, they can be conjoined as into a one, thoughnot at the same time their bodies. This is especially the case between marriedpartners who inmostly love each other. But because woman is from man, and thisconjunction is a kind of reunition, it can be seen from reason that it is notconjunction into a one but adjunction, near and close, according to the love,and in the case of those who are in love truly conjugial, even to contact. Thisadjunction may be called spiritual cohabitation, and it exists with partners whotenderly love each other, however distant they are in body. CL 1582 Love isnothing but a desire and thence a striving for conjunction, and conjugial lovefor conjunction into a one; for the male and the138 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS female were so created that from two they maybecome as one person or one flesh; and when they become one, then, takentogether, they are human in the fullest. Without this conjunction they are two,and each, as it were, is a divided or half person. CL 37 An image of the husbandis being formed in the wife, and from this image, the wife perceives, sees, andfeels within herself the things which are in her husband, and thence, as itwere, herself in them. She perceives from the communication, sees from theaspect, and feels from the touch . . . From the touch, she feels the receptionof her love by her husband in the palms of his hands, on his cheeks, arms,hands, and breasts. CL 173 I have heard it attested by those who have lived forages with their partners in heaven that they feel themselves to be thus united,the husband feeling himself to be united with his wife, and the wife with thehusband, and each having the feeling of being in the other, as though unitedeven in the flesh, although they are separate beings. CL 178 In its essence,conjugial love is nothing else than the willing of two to be a one, that is,their will that the two lives shall become one life. CL 215 Conjugial Love inHeaven That not everyone finds their true partner during their lifetime in theworld is obvious. In Conjugial Love Swedenborg explains how 'conjugial partnersare reunited after death, and how others find their conjugial counterpart'. Thisconjugial relationship is a fundamental aspect of creation and plays a centralrole in the spiritual world. Being essentially spiritual, how is conjugial loveexpressed and made manifest with those in a heavenly state in the life afterdeath? Two partners in heaven are not two but one angel. Therefore, by conjugialunition they fill themselves with the human, which consists in willing to becomewise, and in loving that which pertains to wisdom. CL 52 Those who are in lovetruly conjugial, after death, when they become angels, return into their youthand adolescence. The males, however worn out with age, become young men; and thewives, however wornSEXUALITY/CONJUGIAL RELATIONSHIP 139 out with age, become young women. Eachconjugial partner returns into the prime of life and into the joys of the age inwhich conjugial love begins to intensify life with new delights, and to inspirewith joyous activity for the sake of proHfication . . . Because they are alwaysgrowing more interiorly young, it follows that love truly conjugial increasesand enters into the delights and joys provided for it from the creation of theworld. These are the delights and joys of the inmost heaven, arising from thelove of the Lord towards heaven and the Church, and thence from the mutual loveof good and truth; from this love every joy in the heavens is derived. Thereason why a man thus grows young in heaven is, that he then enters into themarriage of good and truth. And there is in good an effort of continually lovingtruth, and in truth there is an effort of continually loving good; and then thewife is good in form, and the man is truth in form. It is from that effort thata man puts off all severity, senile harshness, mournfulress, and want ofvitality, and puts on the activity, gladness, and freshness of youth, from whichthe effort receives life and becomes joy . . . From marriages in the heavens,although married partners are there united as on earth, children are not born,but instead of children, goods and truths, and thence wisdom. AE 1000* Thespiritual offspring which are born of their marriages are such things as pertainto the wisdom from the father and the love from the mother. These they love froma spiritual love of offspring, and this love adds itself to their conjugiallove, continually elevating it and conjoining the partners. CL 211 Marriedpartners enjoy similar intercourse with each other as in the world, but moredelightful and blessed, yet without proHfication; for which, or in place of it,they have spiritual proHfication, which is that of love and wisdom . . . Thatthe intercourse is then more delightful and blessed, is because, when that lovebecomes a love of the spirit, it becomes more interior and purer and thereforemore perceptible; for every deHght increases according to perception, and it soincreases that its blessedness is observed in its delight. CL 51 The beauty ofthe manifestations of conjugial love is presented vividly in some ofSwedenborg's most descriptive writing. In the vignettes, which he callsmemorabilia, he graphically recounts particular encounters experienced in thespiritual world, like the following.140 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS We were introduced into a room adjoining thebedchamber. Here, on the walls, were many works of art and some small images asthough cast in silver; and I asked 'What are these?' The husband said: 'They arepictures and forms representative of the many qualities, attributes, anddelights which belong to conjugial love- Some represent the unity of souls, somethe conjunction of minds, some the concord of hearts, and some the delightsarising therefrom'. While examining these representations, we saw upon the walla rainbow, as it were, composed of three colours, crimson, hyacinthine, andwhite; and we saw how that the crimson passed through the hyacinthine and tingedthe white with dark blue, while the white flowed back through the hyacinthineinto the crimson and raised it to a flamy beam, as it were. The husband thenasked me, 'Do you understand this?' I answered, 'Instruct me'; whereupon hesaid: 'From its correspondence, the crimson signifies the conjugial love of thewife, the white the intelligence of the husband, the hyacinthine the beginningof conjugial love in the husband's perception from the wife, and the dark bluewith which the white was tinged, conjugial love then in the husband. The flowingback of this colour through the hyacinthine into the crimson and the raising ofthe latter to a flamy beam, as it were, signifies the conjugial love of thehusband flowing back to the wife. Such things are represented on these wallswhenever, from meditation on conjugial love and its mutual, successive, andsimultaneous union, we look with intent gaze at the rainbows there pictured/ CL766'1 Truly conjugial love is represented in heaven by various means. It isrepresented by diamond auras, glistening as if with rubies and garnets, also bythe most beautiful rainbows and showers of gold, the sight of which fillsbystanders with such pleasure and delight that their minds are stirred to theirdepths. I have heard the angels in the gardens of heaven when conjugial love wasso represented, and they said that they were filled with such delight that theycould not express it otherwise than by saying it was delight itself, from whichall other delights sprang as from their origin. They said that this was puremental delight, without any arousing of lust. For such is conjugial love inorigin. Since truly conjugial love in origin is pure mental delight itself, andthat is the fundamental of ail loves; and since it is from love thatSEXUALITY/CONJUGIAL RELATIONSHIP 141 the angels in heaven have all their beauty,for love or the affection of love forms each individual, which results in everyangel's face being a likeness of his love or affection; therefore all the beautyof the angels in heaven comes from their conjugial love, for it is the source ofthe inmost part of their life, which shines through. DC 1, 2 Distortions ofConjugial Love All spiritual or heavenly qualities are lowered and distorted byego consciousness or selfishness, though not necessarily overtly. There existswith some a certain resemblance of conjugial love, but yet it is not conjugiallove, unless they are in the love of good and truth. It is a love appearing likeconjugial love, but it arises from motives of the love of the world or of self,namely, that such persons may be served at home, that they may live in ease andsecurity, that they may be taken care of in illness and old age, or for the sakeof their children whom they love. With some what produces this love iscompulsion arising from fear of the married partner, fear for their reputation,and fear of misfortunes; with some it is the love of lasciviousness. AC 2742Conjugial love, precipitated without order and its modes, burns out the marrowsand is consumed. This is so stated by some in heaven; and by the marrows theymean the interiors of the mind and body. The reason why these are burned out,that is, are consumed, when conjugial love is precipitated, is because the lovethen commences from a flame which consumes and destroys the sanctuaries wherein,as in its beginnings, conjugial love is to dwell, and from which it is tocommence. This is the case when a man and woman precipitate marriage withoutorder, not looking to the Lord, not consulting reason, rejecting betrothal, andyielding only to the flesh; and if that love commences from the burning heat ofthe flesh, it becomes external and not internal, thus not conjugial. It can thenbe called a shell love, not a kernel love; or a flesh love, lean and dry,emptied of its genuine essence. CL 312 As we have seen, for Swedenborg conjugiallove and sexual love are not opposites but inner and outer aspects — the inner,when active and present, purifying the outer. The hellish distortion which isthe opposite of conjugial love Swedenborg calls scortatory love.112 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS The delights of scortatory love commence fromthe flesh and are delights of the flesh even in the spirit; but the delights ofconjugial love commence in the spirit and are delights of the spirit even in theflesh. CL 440 Each sphere — that of scortatory love which ascends from hell, andthat of conjugial love which descends from heaven — affects with its delight theman who receives it. The reason is because the ultimate plane is the same,namely the plane wherein the delights of each love terminate, where also theyare fulfilled and completed, and which makes their presence manifest by itssensation in them. Hence it is, that in outmost manifestation, scortatoryembraces and conjugial embraces are perceived as being alike, although inwardlythey are wholly unalike. That they are therefore unlike in their outmostmanifestation cannot be judged from any sensation of the difference, for noothers can sensate dissimilitudes from differences in outmosts save those whoare in love truly conjugial. Evil is recognized from good but not good fromevil. CL 439 From the natural perception of the outward ego it is very difficultto detect the difference. Often we are unaware of the real motives which driveeven our own actions, let alone those of others, and Swedenborg warns of thedanger of judging from appearances. There are marriages in which there is noappearance of conjugial love, and yet it is there, and there are marriages inwhich there is an appearance of conjugial love, and yet it is not there . . .Conclusion as to whether a man has or has not conjugial love must not be madefrom the appearance of marriage or scortation. Therefore, 'judge not that you benot condemned1 (Matthew 7:1). CL 531 The Delights of Conjugial Love In thespiritual uniting of male and female in conjugial love, is reflected the unityof heart and mind which is receptive of the Divine Love and Wisdom, from whichall heavenly delights flow. When such unity exists on all levels there is aconjugial bonding which grows ever more delightful. These [delights] are fromthe uses of love and wisdom. This can be seen from the fact, that so far as oneloves to be wise for the sake of genuine use he is in the vein and potency ofconjugial love, and so far as he is in these two he is in its delights. It isuse that doesSEXUALITY/CONJUGIAL RELATIONSHIP 143 this; for when love acts by means ofwisdom, the two are in mutual delight, and they sport together like littlechildren, as it were. Then, as they come to adolescence, they join togetherproductively, this being done as though by betrothals, nuptials, marriages, andpropogations, and this continually and with variety, to all eternity. This iswhat takes place between love and wisdom; but from there they insinuatethemselves into the interiors of the mind, under the appearance of peace andinnocence, and into the exteriors of the mind under the appearance ofblessedness, happiness, and delight. In the breast, they are present under theappearance of the delights of inmost friendship, and in the genital region fromcontinuous influx from the soul itself, together with the actual sensation ofconjugial love, as the delight of delights. In the soul, these nuptial sports oflove and wisdom in use are persistent in their proceeding towards the breast,and in that breast they present themselves sensibly under an infinite variety ofdelights. Then, by reason of the marvellous communication of the breast with thegenital region, in the latter these delights become the delights of conjugiallove — delights which are exalted above all delights in heaven and in the world. . . Those who are not in the love of becoming wise from the Lord for the sakeof use, know nothing of the variety of the innumerable delights of love trulyconjugial. CL 1836~*11 SPIRITUAL AGES OF MAN The pattern of the spirit's growth and regeneration iscomplex in its details. Nevertheless, there are definite stages through which itmust pass. Swedenborg describes these stages in terms relating to the ages ofman, and applies this order to the pattern of growth not only of a man but alsoof any body or organization — be it a nation or a church. In fact he sees thewhole human race as having gone through similar stages of development. TheChurch appears in the sight of the Lord as one Man; and as the Grand Man[Universal Human] it must pass through its ages like an individual, advancingfrom infancy to youth, from this to manhood, and at length to old age; and then,when he dies, he will rise again. TCR 162 A spiritual man is the church inparticular, and a number are the Church in general. AC 4292 As soon as anyone isborn he is brought into a state of innocence. This state then serves as thebasis of all other states and is the inner core of them all; and this state ismeant in the Word by *a suckling*. After he has been brought into a state ofinnocence he is led into a state of affection for celestial good, that is, intoa state of love towards parents, which with them exists in place of love to theLord; this state is meant by *a young child1. After that he is led into a stateof affection for spiritual good, which is mutual love, or charity towards thosewho are children like himself, which state is meant by the expression 'boys'.When he grows up further still he is led into a state of affection for truth;this is meant by the expression 'young men'. Subsequent states however are meantby 'men' and at last 'old men*. This final state is a state of wisdom which hasthe innocence of earliest childhood within in, and so the first state andSPIRITUAL AGES OF MAN 145 the last are united. And when he is old, being a smallchild again yet one who is now wise, that person is led into the Lord's kingdom.AC 3183 The first state is one of ignorance, and also of innocence in ignorance.During the continuance of this period the interior states are being formed foruse, consequently only the most external come to light, which are those of thesensual man; when this is the case ignorance reigns. The second state is one ofinstruction and knowledge . . . this is not yet a state of intelligence, becausethe child at that time does not form conclusions from himself, neither does heof himself discern between truths and truths, nor even between truths andfalsities, but from others. He thinks and speaks only of things which are in hismemory, thus from knowledge alone; nor does he see and perceive whether a thingbe so, except on the authority of his master, thus because another has told himso. The third state is called a state of intelligence, since then a man thinks,discerns, and forms conclusions of himself; and what he then concludes is hisown and not another's. At this time faith begins; for faith does not become thefaith of the man himself, until he has confirmed what he believes from the ideasof his own thought. Previous to this time faith is not his own, but another's inhim; for he had believed the person, not the thing. It is therefore clear that astate of intelligence begins with man when he no longer thinks from a teacher,but for himself; this is not the case until the interiors are open towardsheaven. It must be observed that exteriorly a man is in the world, butinteriorly in heaven; and that in proportion to the amount of light flowing infrom heaven into those things which are from the world, in the same proportion aman becomes intelligent and wise. This is effected in the degree and accordingto the way in which the interiors are opened; and they are so far opened as aman lives for heaven and not for the world. But the last state is a state ofwisdom, and of innocence in wisdom; this is the state when man has no longer anyconcern about understanding truth and good, but about willing and living them;for this is to be wise. And man can will truth and good and live them so far ashe is in innocence, that is, so far as he believes that he is wise in nothing ofhimself, but that whatsoever wisdom he has is146 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS from the Lord; also so far as he loves it tobe so; hence it is that this state also is one of innocence in wisdom. From thesuccession of these states, a man who is wise may also come to see the wonderfulthings of Divine Providence, such as these; that a prior state is the plane forthose which continually follow, and that the opening or unfolding of theinterior states proceeds from outermost to inmost things successively, so thatat length what were at first outermost things, are at last inmost things, thatis, ignorance and innocence. For he who is conscious that of himself he isignorant of all things, and that whatever he knows is from the Lord, is in theignorance of wisdom, and also in the innocence of wisdom. AC 102255-1 Howeverthe development of a man — or a church — is not necessarily spirituallyprogressive; for when the man or church becomes more self-centred, a state ofspiritual decline will inevitably ensue. The case is the same with the church ingeneral as with men in particular; his first state is one of innocence, so alsoof love towards parents, his nurse, and also his little companions; his secondstate is one of light; for when the little child becomes a boy, then he learnsthose things which belong to light, or the truths of faith, and believes them;the third state is when he begins to love the world and to love himself, as isthe case when he becomes a youth and thinks for himself; and in proportion asthese loves increase, in the same measure faith decreases, and with faith,charity towards the neighbour and love to God. The fourth and last state is thatin which he does not concern himself about truths and especially when he deniesthem. Such also are the states of every church from its beginning to its end;its first state is one of infancy, thus of innocence, consequently of love tothe Lord — this state of the church is called morning; the second is a state oflight, day; the third is a state of light in obscurity, which is its evening;and the fourth is a state in which there is no love and therefore no light, andthis is its night. AC 10134*$9 Speaking of the church on earth in its mostgeneral form, that is as an entire spiritual age or epoch, Swedenborgdistinguishes four overall phases or churches up to his own time, each of whichwent through the above cycle. The ancients distinguished the several ages of theworld from firstSPIRITUAL AGES OF MAN 147 to last into the golden, the silver, the copper, andthe iron ages, to which they added an age of clay. They called those times thegolden ages when there was innocence and integrity, and when everyone did whatwas good from good, and what was just from justice. They called those times thesilver ages when there was no longer innocence, but still a kind of integritythat consisted not in doing good from good, but in doing truth from truth; andthey gave the name of copper and iron to the ages which are yet lower. Thus theydesignated these periods not from comparison, but from correspondence; for theancients knew that silver corresponds to truth, and gold to good. AC 56582'3Swedenborg's own analysis and terminology is based on the Bible, and heclassifies the spiritual history of mankind into the following phases: INFANCYPERIOD Most Ancient Church (down to the Universal Flood) CHILDHOOD PERIODAncient Church (from the time of Noah — to the call of Abram {Genesis 121) YOUTHPERIOD Israelitish (and Jewish) Church (from Abraham to the Coming of Christ)EARLY MANHOOD PERIOD Christian Church (From Christ to the 18th Century) Infancy(Most Ancient Church) Of this first pre-mythic period, long before the dawn ofrecorded history, the so called Golden Age, Swedenborg outlines a picture ofpure innocent spirituality. In the Most Ancient Church before the flood therewas not a written Word but one revealed to each member of the Church; for theywere celestial people and so, like the angels in whose company they lived, knewthrough perception that which was good and true. Thus they had the Word writtenon their hearts. . . Because they were celestial people; and lived in thecompany of angels, everything they saw and apprehended with any of their senseswas to them a representative and a meaningful sign of celestial and spiritualthings within the Lord's kingdom; so that they did indeed see worldly andearthly things with their eyes or apprehend them with one or other of theirsenses; but118 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS from and through those things their thoughtswere of celestial and spiritual things. In this and no other way they were ableto talk to angels, for the things that exist among angels are celestial andspiritual, and when these come down to man they descend into such things asexist with man in the world. AC 2896 The Most Ancient Church possessed immediaterevelation through direct contact with spirits and angels, and also throughvisions and dreams from the Lord. These experiences enabled them to know in ageneral way what good and truth were, and once they knew them in this generalway their general or primary matters of knowledge were confirmed by means ofcountless details acquired through perceptions. These countless detailsconstituted the particular and the individual aspects of the general knowledgeto which they had reference. In this manner general or primary knowledge wasbeing corroborated day by day. If anything was not in keeping with generalmatters of knowledge they perceived that it was not; and if anything was inkeeping they perceived that it was. Such also is the state of celestial angels.The general, primary, matters of knowledge of the Most Ancient Church werecelestial and eternal truths: for example, that the Lord governs the wholeuniverse; that the Lord is the source of all good and truth; that the Lord isthe source of all life; that man's proprium was nothing but evil, and in itselfsomething dead; in addition to other general truths such as these. And theyreceived from the Lord a perception of countless considerations confirming andharmonizing with these truths. For those people, love was the chief thing offaith, and through love they were allowed by the Lord to perceive anything thatwas a matter of faith. Consequently faith to them was love. AC 5912 Whatever themember of the Most Ancient Church saw with his eyes was for him heavenly, and sowith him every single thing was so to speak, alive. AC 9202 The most ancientpeople, who lived before the flood, saw in every single thing — in mountains,hills, plains, and valleys, in gardens, groves, forests, rivers, and waters, infields and crops, in trees of every kind, also in living creatures of everykind, and in the heavenly bodies giving light — something that was arepresentative and a meaningfulSPIRITUAL AGES OF MAN 149 sign of the Lord's kingdom. But they never let theireyes, still less their minds, linger over such objects; for them these objectsserved instead as the means for thinking about the celestial and spiritualthings that exist in the Lord's kingdom. Indeed so much was this the case withthose objects that there was nothing at all in the whole natural world thatfailed to serve those people as means. AC 27225 The most ancient people — whowere celestial and had no knowledge at all of what it was to employ pretence,let alone of what hypocrisy or what deceit was — were able to see the mind ofanother plainly revealed in his face. AC 35272 The most ancient people . . .were all content with their own goods; and it was then altogether unknown whatit is to become rich from the goods of others, and to exercise dominion . . .Everyone then did good from good, and what is just from justice. They did notknow what it is to do what is good and just for the sake of self honour, or forthe sake of gain. They did not then speak anything but what was true; and thisnot so much from truth, as from good . . . those times were also known toancient writers, and were called by them the golden and also the Satumian age.AC 8118 Members of the Most Ancient Church possessed the cognitions of truefaith by means of revelations, for they talked to the Lord and to angels. Theywere also taught through visions and dreams, which to them were supremelydelightful and blissful. They received perception from the Lord continually; andas a result of that perception, when they thought from things in their memorythey instantly perceived whether these were true and good, in so much that whenanything false came up they not only had nothing to do with it but were alsohorrified. AC 125 The member of the Most Ancient Church possessed internalbreathing, but no external breathing except that which was soundless.Consequently people spoke not so much by means of vocal utterances, as they didin later times and as they do nowadays, but like angels, by means of ideas. Theywere able to express ideas by means of countless alterations in their facialexpressions and in their looks, and especially by means of alterations of thelips where there are innumerable threads150 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS of muscular fibres which are all knotted upnowadays but which had freedom of movement in those times. They were in this wayable to present, mean, and represent inside a minute things which nowadays takean hour by the use of articulated sounds or utterance. And they did so far morefully and more clearly to the comprehension and understanding of those presentthan can possibly be done with words or sentences. AC 6072 It is interesting tonote that Swedenborg describes how the people of this Church were not hunters,but vegetarian. In most ancient times people never ate the flesh of any beast orbird, but only different kinds of grain, especially wheat and bread, also thefruit of trees, vegetables, milk, and milk products such as butter. Slaughteringliving creatures and eating their flesh was to them abominable, akin to thebehaviour of wild animals. AC 1002 The Most Ancient Church which existed beforethe flood never knew anything at all about sacrifices, nor did it ever entertheir minds to worship the Lord by the slaughtering of animals. AC 2180*Childhood (Ancient Church) With the passing of generations of the Most AncientChurch, Divine and heavenly things gradually became reduced to a merely sensuallevel. The men of the Most Ancient Church began to love worldly things more thanheavenly ones, and to be elated and to glory an account of their wisdom. Fromthis their descendants became sensuous, and then their sensuous [faculty], whichis meant by 'the serpent', seduced them. AE 1391 But after that which iscelestial, which is essentially love to the Lord, had perished with man, thehuman race existed no longer in that state, that is, in the state of seeing fromworldly objects the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom. AC27226 The Ancient Church, set up by the Lord after the Flood, was arepresentative church, and was of such a nature that all and each of itsexternals of worship represented the celestial and spiritual things of theLord's kingdom, and, in the supreme sense, the Divine things of the Lordthemselves; . . . this Church was spread over a large partSPIRITUAL AGES OF MAN 151 of the Asiatic world, and through many kingdoms there;and although there were differences among them as to doctrinal things of faith,still the Church was one, because everything in every part of it made charitythe essential of the Church. AC 46802 The God worshipped in the Ancient Churchwas the Lord as to the Divine Human, and it was known to them that it was theLord who was represented in each of the rituals of their church; and many ofthem also knew that the Lord was about to come into the world, and make thehuman in Himself Divine. AC 6846 The internal aspects of the Ancient Churchcomprised all things that belonged to charity and to faith deriving fromcharity, all humility, all worship of the Lord that stems from charity, everygood affection towards the neighbour, and other aspects like these. The externalfeatures of that church were sacrifices, drink offerings, and much else, all ofwhich, by means of representation, were directed to the Lord and had regard toHim. Consequently things of an internal nature existed within those that wereexternal and made a single Church. The internal features of the Christian Churchare just the same as the internal features of the Ancient Church, but differentexternals have ensued. That is to say, instead of sacrifices and the like, [theChristian Church] has sacraments which in a similar way have regard to the Lord. . . Worship of the Lord that stems from charity cannot possibly be different,no matter how much externals may vary. AC 10837 Another important differencewith this new spiritual type was its need to have truth expressed in verbal form— in articulated words that unfortunately tended to limit the perception oftruth which is beyond words. When internal breathing came to an end, externalbreathing practically the same as that today gradually took its place. And withexternal breathing came vocal speech or articulated sounds, which encapsulatedthe ideas comprising thought. In this way man's state was completely changed,$nd he became such as to be incapable any longer of possessing perception ofthat kind. Instead of perception he had a different kind of dictate, which maybe called conscience, for though similar to conscience, it was in fact somethinghalfway between perception and conscience as some people know it today. And oncesuch an152 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS encapsulation of the ideas comprising thoughthad taken place, that is to say, within vocal speech, people could not be taughtany longer by way of the internal man, as the most ancient people had been, butby way of the external. Consequently the revelations that the Most AncientChurch received were succeeded by matters of doctrine which had first of all tobe apprehended by the external senses. AC 608 With the passage of time thisChurch too declined — by regarding objects used to symbolize aspects of theDivine, as Divine in themselves. The idolatries of nations in ancient timesarose from a knowledge of correspondences, because all things that appear on theearth have a correspondence, as trees, beasts, and birds of every kind, alsofishes and all other things. The ancients who had a knowledge of correspondencesmade for themselves images corresponding to heavenly things, and they tookdelight in them because they signified things of heaven and the Church. Theseimages therefore they set up, not only in their temples but also in their homes,not to worship them, but that they might remind them of the heavenly thingswhich they signified. Thus in Egypt and elsewhere they set up in effigy calves,oxen, serpents, also children, old men, and virgins; because calves and oxensignified the affections and powers of the natural man; serpents, the prudenceand also the cunning of the sensual man; children innocence and charity; oldmen, wisdom; and virgins, the affections of truth; and so on. When, however, theknowledge of correspondences was lost, their posterity began to worship as holy,and at length as deities, the images and likenesses set up by the ancients,because these were in and about their temples. . . The knowledge ofcorrespondences remained among many eastern nations even until the coming of theLord. TCR 205 Youth (Israelitish Church) Gradually the Ancient Church declinedas idolatry increased and the knowledge of correspondences was perverted bybeing used for magical practices of an evil nature, and a third age emerged. Inthe course of time this Church turned away to idolatry, and in Egypt, Babylon,and other places, to magic; for they began to worship external things withoutinternal. AC 46802SPIRITUAL AGES OF MAN 153 At last, it pleased the Lord to set up among theposterity of Abraham from Jacob a new kind of Church, and to introduce amongthat nation the externals of worship of the Ancient Church. But such was thenature of this nation that they could not receive any internal of the Church,because their hearts were altogether opposed to charity; and therefore, only arepresentative of a Church was instituted among them. AC 4680* Therepresentatives and significatives of the Ancient Church . . . were [in Egypt]turned into magical things, for by means of the representatives andsignificatives of the Church, there was at that time communication with heaven.This communication existed with those who lived in the good of charity, and withmany of them it was open; but those who did not live in the good of charity, butin what was opposed to charity, sometimes had open communication with evilspirits, who perverted all the truths of the Church, and with them destroyed itsgoods; hence came magical practices . . . Magic is nothing but the perversion oforder; it is especially the abuse of correspondences . . . Lest, therefore, therepresentatives and significatives of the Church should any longer be turnedinto magical things, the Israelitish people were selected, that therepresentatives and significatives of the Church might be restored among them.That people were of such a character that they could not fabricate anythingmagical out of those representatives and significatives; for they werealtogether in externals, and had no belief in the existence of anythinginternal, still less of anything spiritual. With people of such a character whatis magical cannot exist in the same way as it did among the Egyptians. AC 6692This Church was instituted with the Israelitish and Jewish nation. But becauseinformation concerning heavenly things, or concerning those things that relateto eternal life, could not be imparted to men of that Church by influx intotheir interiors, and thus by enlightenment, therefore angels from heaven spokeby a living voice with some of them, and instructed them about external things,but little about internal things, because they could not comprehend these. Thosewho were in a state of natural good received reverently the things taught them,whence those times were called the Brazen Age, for brass signifies such good. AC10355*154 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS Early Adulthood (Christian Church) The mainreason for the existence of the Israelitish church which had been only arepresentative of a church, not a true spiritual one, was that a new Word, orSacred Scripture, would be written by them from their history, which would serveas a necessary basis for the immanent incarnation of the promised Messiah — theChrist. But when not even natural good remained with the man of the Church, theLord came into the world, and brought into order all things in the heavens andthe hells, in order that men might receive influx from Him from heaven, and beenlightened, and that the hells might not hinder and diffuse thick darkness.Then a fourth Church commenced which is called the Christian Church. In thisChurch, information about heavenly things, or the things which relate to eternallife, comes solely by means of the Word, through which men receive influx andenlightenment; for the Word has been written both by pure correspondences and bypure representatives, which signify heavenly things. Into these heavenly thingsthe angels of heaven come when a man reads the Word. Hence by means of the Wordthe conjunction of heaven with the Church, or of the angels of heaven with themen of the Church is affected, but only with those there who are in the good oflove and to charity. But because the man of this Church has extinguished thisgood also, therefore he can receive information neither by influx norenlightenment therefrom, except only in regard to certain truths, whichnevertheless do not unite with good. These times, therefore, are called the IronAge; iron denoting truth in the ultimate of order. AC 10355s The Lord Himselfcame into the world and opened the interior things of the Word, especially thoserelating to Himself, to love Him, to love the neighbour and to have faith inHim; these previously lay concealed in the interiors of the Word, because theywere in its representatives, and consequently in everything pertaining to theChurch and worship. Those truths which the Lord unfolded were interior truths,and in themselves spiritual, which afterwards served the new Church for doctrineand for life. But still they were not immediately received, nor till after aconsiderable lapse of time, as is well known from ecclesiastical history. AE6702SPIRITUAL AGES OF MAN 155 When the Lord came into the world, He abrogated therepresentatives, which were all external and instituted a Church all things ofwhich should be internal. Of all those representatives the Lord retained buttwo, which should include in comprehensive form all things pertaining to theinterior Church. These two are baptism in place of washings, and the Holy Supperin place of the lamb which was sacrificed every day. TCR 670 Swedenborg wasimpressed with the purity and genuineness of the earliest phase of the ChristianChurch though he did not appear to have detailed knowledge of their doctrines.But he recognizes a rapid decline from this spirituality with the establishmentof the Church and the formulation of dogmatic creeds. In general terms, he isthereafter very critical of all its doctrinal developments and the quality ofits leadership. In the Christian world it is their doctrines that cause churchesto be distinct and separate, and because of these they call themselves RomanCatholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, the Reformed or Evangelical, among othernames. It is solely by reason of their doctrines that they are called by thesenames. This situation would never exist if they were to make love to the Lordand charity towards the neighbour the chief thing of faith. In this case theirdoctrinal differences would be no more than shades of opinion concerning themysteries of faith which truly Christian people would leave to individualconscience, and in their hearts would say that a person is truly a Christianwhen he lives as a Christian, that is, as the Lord teaches. If this was so allthe different churches would become one, and all the disagreements which stemfrom doctrine alone would disappear. AC 1799A The fourth Church . . . which wascalled Christian, acknowledged one God indeed with the lips, but in threePersons, each of whom singly or by Himself was God. Thus they worshipped adivided Trinity, and not a Trinity united in one Person. The result was that anidea of three gods was fixed in the mind, although the expression, one God, wason the lips. As, however, all the four churches were not in that truth, itfollows that a Church is to succeed them which will know and acknowledge oneGod. For the Divine love of God had no other end in creating the world than toconjoin man to Himself, and Himself to man, and thus to dwell with man. TCR 786156 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS The Christian Church from its earliestinfancy began to be infested and rent assunder by schism and heresies ... thecauses of so many schisms and dissentions in the Church are chiefly three.First, the Divine Trinity has not been understood. Second, there has been nojust knowledge of the Lord. Third, the passion of the cross has been regarded asredemption itself. These three matters are the essentials of that faith fromwhich the Church exists and takes its name; and as long as they aremisunderstood, all things of the Church must be diverted from their rightcourse, and at last turned backwards. TCR 378xz That the churches after thetimes of the apostles fell away into so many heresies, and that at the presenttime there are none other than false churches, is owing to their not havingapproached the Lord, when yet the Lord is the Word, and the Light itself whichenlightens the whole world. Inv 3812 LAST JUDGMENT Judgment, as indicated in an earlier section, is a spiritualprocess through which everyone passes at a certain stage in their spiritualdevelopment. When it takes place on a general scale, affecting a whole spiritualdispensation on earth, Swedenborg calls it a Last Judgment. The expression 4LastJudgment' is used to mean the final period of a church, and also to mean thefinal phase of each person's life. As regards to the final period of a church,the last judgment of the Most Ancient Church, which had existed before theflood, occurred when Their descendants perished, whose destruction is describedby the Flood. The last judgment of the Ancient Church, which existed after theFlood, took place when almost all who belonged to that church had becomeidolaters and had been scattered. The last judgment of the representativechurch, which followed next, among the descendants of Jacob, came about when theten tribes were led away into captivity and dispersed among the gentile nations;and later on when the Jews after the Lord's coming were expelled from the landof Canaan and were scattered throughout the whole world. The last judgment ofthe Church existing at present, which is called the Christian Church, is what'the new heaven and the new earth' is used to mean by John in the book ofRevelation. AC 2118 This process ensues when the light of truth shines sopowerfully that the areas of light and darkness in the heart and mind can beclearly distinguished and separated. Swedenborg sees illustrations of this inparables of Jesus such as the separating out of the tares (weeds) at harvesttime for burning, and the ingathering of the wheat. A Last Judgment comes topass when, in the world of spirits below the heavens, the evil are multiplied tosuch an extent that the angels158 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS in the heavens cannot continue to exist inthe state of their love and wisdom, for then they do not have a support andfoundation. And because this occurs as a result of the multiplication of theevil below, therefore the Lord, in order to preserve their state, inflows withHis Divine more and more strongly, and this goes on until they cannot bepreserved by any influx unless the evil below are separated from the good. Andthis separation is done by the subsidence and nearer approach of the heavens,and the resultant stronger influx, until the point is reached when the evil areunable to sustain it, whereupon the evil flee away and cast themselves intohell. AR 343 In reading that a Last Judgment takes place in the spiritual worldit should be remembered that our own inner world is that spiritual world. Andwhile the effects of a 'Last Judgment* may not be visible at the external levelof institutions and organizations, men on earth are spiritually affected by it.A Last Judgment does not take place on earth, but in the spiritual world, whereall from the beginning of creation are together. And since this is the case, itcannot come within the knowledge of any man when a Last Judgment wasaccomplished, for each one expects it on earth, and expects along with it, achange of everything in heaven which is before the eyes, as well as on earth andwith the human race there, LJ 45 But it ought to be known that the Last Judgmentwas effected upon those who had lived from the time of the Lord down to thepresent day, but not upon those that had lived before then. For a Last Judgmenthad taken place twice before on this earth; one was that described in the Wordby the 'Flood', the other by the Lord Himself when He was in the world. LJ 46One of the primary purposes of a Last Judgment is to maintain the spiritualequilibrium between heaven and hell in order to preserve man's freedom tochoose. There are many reasons for the Last Judgment taking place when theChurch is at an end. The first is that the equilibrium between heaven and hellthen begins to perish, and with the equilibrium, the very freedom of man, andwhen man's freedom perishes, then he can no longer be saved. For he is thencarried away from freedom towards hell and cannot be led in freedom towardsheaven. For, withoutLAST JUDGMENT 159 freedom, no one can be reformed, and all man's freedom is fromthe equilibrium between heaven and hell. LJ 33 In his spiritual diary Swedenborgrecords witnessing the outer, visible manifestations in the spiritual world of aLast Judgment that commenced in 1757 as the result of accumulated distortions ofthe Christian message and growing hypocrisy and worldliness within the churchesof that time. He explains how this took place in order that a new spiritualdispensation (or New Age) might be born, purified of distortions, and heraldinga new inner freedom from the power of dogma, when man would be much more able,if he wished, to distinguish the truth or otherwise, in the spiritual teachingsof others. As to the state of the Church, this would not be the same hereafter.It will be similar indeed as to the external appearance, but unlike as to theinternal. As to external appearances there will be divided churches as before,their doctrines will be taught as before, as also the religiosity among thegentiles. But henceforth the man of the Church will be in a freer state ofthinking about matters of faith, and therefore, about the spiritual things thatbelong to heaven, because spiritual freedom has been restored. For all thingshave now been brought back into order in the heavens and in the hells . . . Butin heaven this truth is perceived, and so it is by the man himself after death.Because spiritual freedom has been restored to man, therefore, the spiritualsense of the Word has now been disclosed, and through it, interior divine truthshave been revealed. LJ 73213 NEW AGE — NEW CHURCH Swedenborg clearly foretold that a new spiritual era wasabout to begin on earth — and revealed that it had already begun in thespiritual world. At this day a New Church is being set up by the Lord, which isunderstood by the New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse, in which the worship will beof the sole Lord. AR 8391 Yet, he gives few details of what it would be like,for, as he had discovered, even angels can see the future only in a very generalway. In calling this the era of the New Church he does not, of course, have inmind any particular organization. He means the emergence of a new religiousspirit — a spirit able to recognize and acknowledge genuine spiritual truth,enabling man to experience and understand his true relationship with the Divine,or the Christ within. This New Church is the crown of all the churches whichhave hitherto been on the earth, because it will worship one visible God, inwhom is the invisible God, as the soul is in the body. Only thus can there beconjunction of God with man, because man is natural, and consequently thinksnaturally; while conjunction must be in thought and so in affection, and thistakes place when a man thinks of God as Man. TCR 787 Revelation of InteriorTruth As Swedenborg wrote, the age of dogma was to pass away. The truth of theNew Church is interior truth, thus truth for the internal man; whereas the truthof the old church is exterior truth, thus truth for the external man. AC 92121In the New Church one is permitted to enter with the understandingNEW AGE - NEW CHURCH 161 into all its interior truths, and also to confirm themby the Word. The reason is that its doctrines are truths in series from theLord, revealed by means of the Word; and confirmation of these by rationalconsiderations opens the higher reaches of the understanding and so elevates itinto the light which the angels of heaven enjoy. TCR 5085 Henceforward enterinto the mysteries of the Word, which has hitherto been a closed book; for allits truths are so many mirrors of the Lord. TCR 5086 In the [New] Church theWord will be understood because it will be transparent by virtue of itsspiritual sense . . . With [those of this Church] the Word shines as it werewhen it is being read. It shines from the Lord by means of its spiritual sensebecause the Lord is the Word, and the spiritual sense is in the light of heaventhat proceeds from the Lord as the Sun. AR 891 From Whom It Will Be FormedSwedenborg explains why the New Church will be formed, in the main, from thoseoutside of the old, established Church. When any church ceases to be a church,that is, when charity perishes, and a new one is established by the Lord, rarelyif ever is this done among those with whom the old church existed. Instead it isestablished among those with whom no church existed previously, that is, amonggentiles . . . The reason why it is among gentiles that the Lord establishes anew church is that they do not possess any false assumptions that are contraryto the truths of faith, for they have no knowledge of the truths of faith. Falseassumptions absorbed from early childhood and subsequently confirmed must firstof all be dispelled before a person can be regenerated and become a member ofthe church. Indeed gentiles are not able to profane holy things by means ofevils of life, for no one can profane what is holy if he does not know what itis... As gentiles do not have such knowledge, there are no stumbling blocks tohinder them. Thus their state is such that they are better able to receivetruths than those who belong to the church; and all those among them who areleading a good life receive truths without difficulty. AC 29862 •3 The reasonwhy the interiors of the Word are now being opened, is162 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS that the church at this day has been so farvastated (that is, so devoid of faith and love) that although men know andunderstand, still they do not acknowledge, and much less believe . . . except afew who are in the life of good and are called the elect, who can now beinstructed, and with whom a New Church is to be instituted. But where these are,the Lord alone knows; there will be few within the church; it has been among thegentiles that previous new churches have been set up. AC 3898* UniversalitySwedenborg is a religious universalist despite the fact that a superficialreading of his writings might suggest at times a new Christian dogmatism. Thoughhe chose to rely heavily on much traditional Christian terminology, he alwaysseeks to express the deep universal truths which are beyond direct words. Theheaven Swedenborg discovered by direct experience is within, and can be enteredby all who sincerely go within to seek the source of a truly loving and usefullife of service. The situation with the Lord's spiritual Church is that it isspread throughout the whole world, and wherever it exists varies so far asmatters of belief or truths of faith are concerned . . . The same applies to theLord's spiritual kingdom in the heavens — that is to say, in matters of faith,variety is so great that not one community, not even one member of a community,is in complete agreement with any other in the things which constitute thetruths of faith. But for all that, the Lord's spiritual kingdom in the heavensis one, the reason being that with everyone charity is the chief thing, forcharity makes the spiritual Church, not faith, unless you say that faith ischarity. AC 3267 Heaven . . . cannot be composed of men all of one religion butof men of many religions. DP 326l0 All nations that have believed in one God,and have had an idea concerning Him as Man, are received by the Lord. AE 957}Dissent in matters of doctrine concerning faith does not mean that the Churchcannot be one church, provided all are of one mind in willing what is good anddoing it. AC 34512 By Relieving in the name of Jesus Christ' is meant believingin theNEW AGE — NEW CHURCH 163 spiritual quality of life He revealed, not a merepaying lip service to a historical figure. People who make worship consist in aname, as Jews do in the name of Jehovah, and Christians in the name of the Lord,are not on that account worthier than any others, for the name is of no avail.But they are worthier when their characters conform to what He has commanded;and this is the meaning of Relieving in His name'. And when they say that thereis salvation in no other name than the Lord's they mean in no other doctrine,that is, in none other than mutual love, which is the true doctrine of faith,and so in none other than the Lord since all love comes from Him alone, and allfaith from that love. AC200912 In the spiritual world, into which every mancomes after death, the question that is asked is not, what was your faith, orwhat was your doctrine? But, what was the nature of your life? Was it of this orthat quality? Thus the enquiry is concerning the nature and quality of the life,for it is known that such as one's life is, such is his faith and also hisdoctrine, because the life fashions doctrine and faith for itself. DP1013Perhaps Swedenborg's most attractive image of universality is that of the Lord'sChurch as being like a crown with many varied jewels. A truly fitting image forthe 'Crown of all the Churches'. Churches which possess differing kinds of goodand truth, so long as the kinds of good they have relate to love to the Lord andthe truths they have relate to faith in the Lord, are like so many jewels in aking's crown. TCR 163 The [New] Church in its whole compass ... in itself isone, but varying in accordance with reception . . . These variations can becompared to the various members and organs in a complete body, which yet makeone; or they can be compared to various diadems in a king's crown. AR 13APPENDIX DISCRETE DEGREES IN MAN Swedenborg's Doctrine of Discrete Degrees (seeChapter 5) in relation to the human spirit is fundamental to his spiritualpsychology. He clearly distinguishes the interior degrees, or levels, withinman's being: they include two purely heavenly degrees/levels — the celestial andthe spiritual, in addition to the lower natural faculties of the mind. There arethree things in man, which follow in successive order; these are called thecelestial, the spiritual, and the natural. The celestial is the good of love tothe Lord, the spiritual the good of charity towards the neighbour, and thenatural therefrom, the good of faith; because this is from the spiritual it iscalled spiritual-natural. It is similar with man as it is in the heavens. In theinmost heaven, which is also called the third heaven, is the celestial; in thesecond or middle heaven, is the spiritual; and in the first or ultimate* heaven,is the natural therefrom, or the spiritual-natural. The reason for this is thata man who is in good, is a heaven in the least form. AC 9992 While each degreeremains discrete, a separate sphere or world as it were, each more interiordegree is contained within the lower or outer. Thus the outer manifestationappears to live from itself, but in reality exists only from influx from within.In a man there is what is inmost, there are interior things under the inmost,and there are exterior things. All these things are most perfectly distinct;they succeed in order, thus from the inmost down to the outermost; according tothe order in which they succeed, they also flow in; hence it is that life flowsthrough the inmost into the interiors, * Swedenborg uses the term 'ultimate' tomean what is furthest from the Divine, i.e. the outermost, or lowest level ofany created series.166 SWEDENBORG: ESSENTIAL READINGS and through the interiors into the exteriors,thus according to the order in which they succeed; and it does not rest exceptin the ultimate of order, where it stops. And as the interior things flow inaccording to order down to the ultimate, and there stop, it is evident that theinterior things are together in the ultimate, but in this order: the inmost,which has flowed in, holds the centre, the interior things which are under theinmost encompass the centre; and the exterior things make the circumference; andthis is not only in general, but also in every detail... As all the interiorsare together in the ultimate, therefore, the appearance is as if life were inthe ultimate, that is, in the body; when yet it is in the interiors, nor yetthere, but in the highest, that is, in the Lord, from whom is the all of life.AC64512*3 Of the interaction of the two heavenly degrees with each other andwith man's natural degree, Swedenborg explains There are two sides to theinternal man, namely the celestial and the spiritual, and these two form asingle entity if the spiritual has its origin in the celestial. Or what amountsto the same, there are the two sides to the internal man known as good andtruth. These two form a single entity if truth has its origin in good. Or whatalso amounts to the same, there are the two sides to the internal man, love andfaith. These two form a single entity if faith has its origin in love. Or, whatyet again amounts to the same, there are the two sides to the internal man, willand understanding. These two form a single entity if the understanding has itsorigin in the will. . . With the external man everything is natural; for theexternal man is one and the same as the natural man. The internal man is said tobe united to the external when the celestial-spiritual comprising the internalman flows into the natural comprising the external man and causes them to act asone. The natural as a consequence becomes celestial and spiritual as well,though it is a lower variety of celestial and spiritual. Or what amounts to thesame, the external man as a consequence becomes celestial and spiritual as well,though it is a more exterior variety of celestial and spiritual man. AC 15772 *3The natural degree of the external man itself can be observed to contain threediscrete levels. There are three constituent parts of the external man —rational,APPENDIX: DISCRETE DEGREES IN MAN 167 factual, and external sensory. Therational part is more interior, the factual more exterior, and the externalsensory the most external. The rational is the part by means of which theinternal man is joined to the external, the character of the rationaldetermining the character of this conjunction. The external sensory partconsists in the present instance in sight and hearing. But in itself therational has no existence if affection does not flow into it, making it activeso as to receive life. Consequently the rational receives its character fromthat of the affection flowing into it. When the affection for good flows in,that affection for good becomes with the rational an affection for truth; andthe contrary happens when the affection for evil flows in. AC 15892 Man'sspiritual growth can proceed upwards through the three principal discretedegrees, though only so far as he is willing to go in his freedom. Yet at eachlevel, he can be to that degree, in the image of God. The human mind, from whichand according to which man is man, is formed into three regions according tothree degrees. In the first degree it is celestial, in which are the angels ofthe highest heaven. In the second degree it is spiritual, in which are theangels of the middle heaven, and in the third degree it is natural, in which arethe angels of the lowest heaven. The human mind, organized according to thesethree degrees, is a receptacle of Divine influx; but the Divine flows in only asfar as a man prepares the way, or opens the door. If he does this to the highestor celestial degree, then the man becomes truly an image of God and, afterdeath, an angel of the highest heaven; but if he prepares the way or opens thedoor, only to the middle or spiritual degree, then the man becomes indeed animage of God, but not so perfectly, and after death he becomes an angel of themiddle heaven; but if he prepares the way, or opens the door only to the lowestor natural degree, then the man, if he acknowledges God and worships Him withreal piety, becomes an image of God in the lowest degree and after death becomesan angel of the lowest heaven.
