He wished to acknowledge those members of the Theosophical Society, Adyar, who made available micro-film copies of H.P.B.’s unpublished articles during his 1977 trip to India; in particular John Coats, Joy Mills and Seetha Neelakantan. A number of manuscripts and fragments appear here for the first time. In a few cases these were difficult to decipher. Surmised words or phrases are bracketed and the compiler left blank spaces where words were totally illegible. Adjacent to the Kabala and Pherecydes articles we have reproduced by offset the entire documents from micro-film, so that the reader may compare the originals. Mr. Richard Robb has redrawn several of the Coptic and Greek symbols, while Hector Tate rendered the geometrical figures in Pistis Sophia according to the way H.P.B. wished them to be corrected in Lucifer. We especially thank Mr. Robb for his patient care in expanding the unfinished bibliography. A number of other workers who assisted Boris with Volume XII continued their dedicated tasks. Vonda Urban was able to secure the cuneiform inscriptions of Mr. Jules Oppert from the University of Chicago Library. Nicholas Weeks assisted in the indexing as well as the proof-reading. We were also fortunate to have the help of Mrs. Jeanne Sims and Shelley Von Strunckel. The serendipity which drew librarians Wayne Montgomery and Vern Haddick to locate several obscure journal references is gratefully acknowledged. Due to circumstances of the Editor’s passing, it was deemed crucial to complete the C.W. series while production could continue in the hands of long-time friend and printer Mr. Everett Stockton, even if a few source materials remained unlocated. Readers who have clues to such quotations are welcome to contact the publisher. The production of Volume XIII has drawn cooperation between individuals of all groups. We thank Erica Lauber in London, Anita Atkins of New York and Melitza Cowling (who translated a Russian version of the St. James Gazette letter, reprinted in The Moscow Herald ). We also sought the helpful advice of Emmett Small of Point Loma Publication, and several other long-time friends of Boris. Of all groups offering time and assistance we make special mention of The Theosophical Society of Pasadena, under the guidance of Grace F. Knoche, Kirby and John Van Mater, as well as I. Manuel Oderberg were tireless in searching their library and archival resources. From the latter Mr. William Dougherty reproduced the photos of Henry More and others. We hope that no one is overlooked in this attempt to thank the many it requires to produce a work of this kind. If so, such persons will feel amply rewarded by the gems from H.P.B.’s pen. There are futuristic articles and creative tales included here. Archaeological finds and unusual hints appear in small fragments of articles which we hope someday will be discovered in their entirety. We hope and trust this work is all that"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"our departed friend and Editor wished it to be. D ARA E KLUND L OS A NGELES , C ALIFORNIA , U.S.A.

This Coptic manuscript is complete, except as noted below, in excellent state of preservation, and contains material of the Valentinian or Ophite schools of Gnosticism. Pistis Sophia is written in the dialect of Upper Egypt, called Thebaidic or Sahidic. It is a translation from the Greek, as Greek words—mostly technical terms and names—abound throughout the manuscript. This is thought to be the result of the translator being unable to find suitable terms in the Coptic (Thebaidic or Sahidic) to express the ideas found in a Greek manuscript. Such terms and names are simply transliterated from the Greek. The date of the Pistis Sophia manuscript is not agreed upon by the various competent scholars who have studied it, but it is generally placed in the 2nd and 3rd century A.D . The many q uotations from the Old and New Testament provide no clue to the exact dating. The manuscript consists of 346 pages, written on both sides of vellum in two columns, and is bound much like a modern book. The pages are numbered in Coptic characters, establishing the fact that only four leaves—eight pages—are missing since the manuscript was bound. It contains parts of five “books,” none of which are complete. The manuscript is the work of more than one scribe which may account for the lacunae and repetitions found in several places. It was called “Pistis Sophia” because at the head of one page, apparently without reason, was written in Coptic, “The Second Tome of the Pistis Sophia.” This manuscript –––––––––– * [In his introduction the compiler follows the modern style of dropping the hyphen in P istis Sophia , but in H.P.B.’s Commentary he has kept it as in Lucifer .] –––––––––– 2  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS was acquired in 1785 by the British Museum with the purchase of the library of Dr. A skew. Where Dr. Askew himself obtained the manuscript remains a mystery.* The earliest reference to the Pistis Sophia manuscript is a statement—unverified—that in 1770, C. G. Woide published an article in a British Theological Magazine on the Pistis Sophia . G. R. S. Mead tried in vain to trace such a magazine or any article on the subject near that date. C. G.

In 1773 and 1778 articles by Woide on the Pistis Sophia appeared in journals published in France and Germany. In 1779 Woide copied by hand the whole of the Askew and Bruce manuscripts but no translation was published. In 1838-40 the manuscripts were copied by the French savant Dulaurier, but no translation ever came to light. In 1848 M. G. Schwartze copied the Pistis Sophia –––––––––– * The following notes were made by the present writer on examining the P istis Sophia manuscript in the British Museum. The book is bound in brown leather with gold stamping on the covers; the spine is ornamented with gold stamping, with the following title in seven lines — PISTE SOPHIA COPTICE. MUS. BRIT. JURE EM PTIONIS. 5114. The end leaves and fly-leaves are of hand-made laid paper, indicating that the volume m ay have been bound by Dr. Askew. The paper page before the vellum of the manuscript contains Latin notes by Woide. The vellum varies greatly in thickness, some leaves being very thin, almost like onion-skin paper, while others are quite heavy and stiff. Some of the pages are clean, the writing being as sharp and black as when written; in places the ink has faded into brown and in a few pages the writing is no longer legible. The scoring lines are plainly visible on all leaves. Small holes and imperfections in the vellum were skillfully repaired before written on; in at least one place a small hole was not repaired, and the writing rises above the scored line to avoid the hole. Pages 99 v. and 100 r. are badly smeared from top to bottom. It appears as if this was deliberately done with a small wad of dirty rag or inked finger. The sentence “Second tome of Pistis Sophia,” which is mentioned above, is barely visible, having faded to a light tan. – ––––––––– C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA   3 m anuscript and made a Latin translation, which was edited after his death by J. H. Petermann, and published in 1851 All the early English translations of the Pistis Sophia are translations of Schwartze’s Latin version. The first partial English translation published was that of C. W. King in the second edition (1887) of his Gnostics and their Remains .* This fragment consisted of a few pages translated from Schwartze’s Latin text. An anonymous translation in French appeared in Migne’s Dictionnaire des Apocryphes , which G. R. S. Mead calls “. . . . a sorry piece of work, more frequently a mere paraphrase from Schwartze’s version than a translation.”† Many learned articles appeared between the publication of the Latin text and the end of the century. In 1895 É. Amélineau published a French translation from the Coptic. In 1905 C. Schmidt published what is considered to be a very fine German translation of the Coptic text, and in 1924 an excellent English translation from the Coptic was published by George Horner. This was the first translation directly from the Coptic into English. It is designated as a “literal translation,” and while this does not always make for as easy and smooth a reading as some of the freer translations, it does preserve, as nearly as possible in English, the exact wording, and in some cases definite clues to the meaning of the original writers. Horner’s English translation contains a very fine and thorough Introduction by Francis Legge. In 1890-91 G. R. S. Mead published in H. P.

In the Introduction ( p. xxxv) he says: “I went over the whole again and checked it by Amélineau’s version,” and on p. xxxvi: “In 1890 I had already translated Schwartze’s Latin version into English and published pages l to 252, with a commentary, notes, etc., in magazine form from April, 1890, to April, 1891.” The magazine referred to is, of course, Lucifer , edited by H. P. Blavatsky, and the above is the only mention made by Mead anywhere of the commentaries and footnotes in Lucifer . In Fragments of a Faith Forgotten , p. 456, Mead writes: “When, in 1896, I published a translation of the Pistis Sophia , I had intended to follow it up with a commentary, but I speedily found that in spite of the years of work I had already given to Gnosticism, there were still many years of labour before me, ere I could satisfy myself that I was competent to essay the task in any really satisfactory fashion; I have accordingly reserved that task for the future.” After Mead’s death in 1933, a careful search through his unpublished manuscripts by John M. Watkins, his literary executor, failed to uncover anything dealing with the Pistis Sophia. A “New and Completely Revised” edition of the Pistis Sophia was published by Mead in 1921, also without notes or commentary. This version was thoroughly compared and checked with Schmidt’s German translation* from the Coptic (1905). In the Preface, p. xx, Mead says: “The second edition is practically a new book.” There exists also a manuscript by P. A. Malpas, (1875-1958) a life-long student of Theosophy, containing a translation of the Pistis Sophia , together with the notes and commentaries from Lucifer and extracts from the writings of the Church Fathers. Mr. Malpas’ translation of the Pistis Sophia is apparently a recension of Latin, German and French translations. –––––––––– * [Ed. Petermann-Schwartze; newly translated by C.

The text which appeared in Lucifer (Vols. 6, 7 & 8) is not complete; contains many abridgements and summaries of repetitive passages. Students wishing to make a study of the complete text of the Pistis Sophia are referred to the 1921 edition of Mead’s Pistis Sophia , or to George Horner’s Pistis Sophia , with Introduction by F. Legge. The introductions to both of these volumes are very valuable as showing the viewpoints of two quite different scholarly approaches to the Pistis Sophia itself, and Gnosticism in general. Only sufficient material will be quoted from Mead’s recension in Lucifer to make H.P.B.’s footnotes and commentaries clearly intelligible. The quotations from the Bible in the present Introduction are according to the Authorized (King James) Version, Oxford University Press. The quotations from the Church Fathers are from The Ante-Nicene Fathers , The Rev. Alexander Roberts, D.D., and James Donaldson, LL.D., editors, (American reprint of the Edinburgh Edition). The extracts from the writings of the Church Fathers included in H.P.B.’s Commentaries are from some other English edition, or possibly translated from a French edition. The references given by H.P.B. with regard to Book, Chapter, and Section do not always correspond to the place where the quotations are found in the American Edition. As far as is known, no English translation of the Panarion of Epiphanius is available, and it is very likely those passages from it have been translated from Migne’s original texts. Quotations from The Secret Doctrine are based on the original edition of 1888. A helpful definition of the title’s meaning has been supplied by P. A. Malpas. “Title: Pistis-Sophia is a combination of two Greek substantives, usually translated F aith and Wisdom . But H. P. Blavatsky plainly shows that Faith in the modern sense is quite an inadequate rendering of the 6  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS te rm Pistis. It is better described as Intuitional Knowledge, or knowledge not yet manifest to the mere intellect, though felt by the Soul to be true. This definition leaves the way open for dogmatists to say that it means precisely what they call faith, and the genuine enquirer needs to be careful in accepting dogmatic definitions of the soul and intellect and to beware of thinking that Pistis has anything to do with “believing” things that are not otherwise known. “Faith” is too often merely another name for “self-persuasion,” which may not be, but usually is, delusion, in one of its fascinating forms. The whole book is highly instructive as to what Pistis really is. The importance of the correct understanding of the word cannot be overestimated for students of the New Testament, when it is realised that Paul was a Gnostic using the Gnostic term in its technical sense, and that however pleasing it may be to attach quite another sense to it, it did not and does not mean what it is usually taken to mean by Europeans of our own day. In the drama of Pistis-Sophia and her sufferings it is clear that her unshakeable intuition that she will be saved by her divine part is the link that enables that divine part to save her. It is the actual testimony that she is not yet finally lost, and in the end it is fully vindicated. Job, another drama of initiation, teaches the same lesson in an ancient Egyptian setting. . .”"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Gnosticism was a syncretistic philosophico-religious movement which included all the manifold systems of belief prevalent in the first two centuries of the Christian era. Originating somewhat prior to Christian times, it combined various elements of Babylonian, Judaic, Persian, Egyptian and Greek metaphysics with certain teachings of dawning Christianity. As a name, Gnosticism is derived from the Greek gn ∩ sis (<äF4l , “knowledge,” more s pecifically spiritual knowledge or esoteric wisdom, a knowledge not attainable by ordinary intellectual processes, and only to be gained by mystical enlightenment or the awakening of the Buddhic elements in man. The emphasis on knowledge as the means of attaining a higher evolutionary stage, and the claim to the possession of this knowledge in ones own doctrine, are common features of the numerous groups in which the Gnostic movement historically expressed itself, even though there were only a few of these groups whose members expressly called C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA   7 t hemselves Gnostics (Gr. gn ∩ stikos — (<TFJ46`l L at. gnosticus ), the “Knowing Ones”*— Compiler .] PISTIS-SOPHIA Notes and Comments by H.

Hercules was to enter upon his twelfth labour, and the sun of the twelfth sign of the Zodiac. Even the popular adage “at the eleventh hour,” is an echo of this mystery.

Nychth ē meron means the space of a day and a night or twenty-four hours. Each grade of initiation had two degrees, in all twenty-four. This explains “the First Mystery, which is the Four-and-Twentieth” of the text. Readers of the Abbé Constant’s work, who are ignorant of Greek, should be warned that the French below the Greek is not even the vaguest possible paraphrase, but simply Lévi’s idea about the text. He is, however, right in saying that “these twelve symbolical hours, which may be compared with the signs of the Zodiac and the labours of Hercules, represent the cycle of degrees of Initiation.” (See The Secret Doctrine , I, 450.) (2) The Greek word translated by “Region” is topos ; it corresponds to the Sanskrit loka . In the second volume of The Secret Doctrine , p. 174, we are told that “Samjñ ā . the daughter of Vi \u0001 vakarman , married to the Sun, ‘unable to endure the fervours of her lord,’ gave him her Chh ā y ā (shadow, image, or astral body), while she herself repaired to the jungle to perform religious devotions, or Tapas .” Verb .

As Ragon, following the occult tradition, has well proved, Masonry was a forced product of the Gnostic mysteries, born of a compromise between Political Christianity and Gnosticism.

Now, the Second Space of the First Mystery corresponds in Esoteric parlance to the second plane of consciousness from within or above, on which plane is Buddhi (the Spiritual Soul), the vehicle of štman (Universal Spirit), the “First Mystery,” which is also “the last Mystery” in the endless cycle of emanation and reabsorption. In Egyptian Esotericism the “dove symbol” of the Gnostics was represented by the glyph of the winged globe. The dove, that descends on “Jesus” at his baptism is typical of the conscious “descent” of the “Higher Self” or Soul ( štma-Buddhi ) on Manas, the Higher Ego; or in other words, the union during initiation of the Christos , with Chr ē stos , or the imperishable “Individuality” in the All , with the transcendent Personality—the Adept.

Finally the plane of the paper, inclosing and penetrating all, is Sig ‘ (Silence). C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA  17 S OME GENERAL HINTS TOWARDS AN EXPLANATION OF THE FIGURES [pp. 19-20]. In all the figures except Fig. 8 the great Hermetic Axiom “As above, so below,” is triumphantly shown f orth, as also the idea of the syzygy, pair or opposite. Let us begin with Fig. 8, remembering that the Point produces the Line; the Line the Superficies; and the Superficies the Solid. In this figure we have a symbol of Fire or Spirit. The vertical line, in the centre of the figure, is the subtlest Fire; this gradually falls into the shape of triangles, their vertical angles growing less and less acute, as their bases expand and at the same time rise to higher planes. Six planes or bases in all, and six triangles, with the point the seventh. The seventh figure generated from the point is the right-angled triangle, the most perfect. The more acute the angle, the subtler the Fire, until it finally reaches the right angle, the balance or turning point of all angles. Now let us take the central point of the whole figure and join it with the extremities of the bases of the triangles; we shall then find that with the point again we have a second series of Seven, viz., the point, two acute-angled, one right-angled, two obtuse-angled triangles, and the horizontal diameter of the Figure. These are the R™pa Planes, the first septenary being the seven fiery Logoi, the second septenary the seven Globes on the four lower planes of the great septenate, etc., etc. Notice again the series of quadrilaterals formed by the intersection of the bases and sides of the triangles, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, the perfect number. Therefore starting from our perpendicular, or Spirit , we arrive by a series of angles through every variety of acuteness to the right-angled triangle, and pass from it through every variety of obtuseness to the horizontal diameter, Matter . This great fact may be more plainly seen in Figs. 11-18, where the same series is traced in rectangular quadrilaterals, of which the balance or turning-point is the Square. Of course it must be remembered that only the perfect types are given, the intermediate types being infinite. For instance, to get from Fig. 11 to Fig. 12, an infinity of points are required; from Fig. 12 to Fig. 13 an infinity of lines; from Fig. 13 to Fig. 14 an infinity of intermediate figures, etc., seven infinities and seven eternities in all. In these figures also it should be noticed that the Vertical has expanded and again decreased into the Horizontal, but in so doing has changed its direction, in other words the wheel has turned. In one of 18  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS th e following papers it is hoped to show the generation of the Svastika and its connection with these figures. Having now obtained our most perfect triangle figure, viz ., the right-angled Triangle, let us proceed to trace the operations of a pair of these. In the series of figures 1-8, we notice the triangle of Spirit with its apex upward and the triangle of Matter with its apex downward. Let those who wish to understand the two Circles"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"surrounding these triangles and gradually involving into one another until finally they become one (Fig. 7), remember the Caduces, and think over what is said in The Secret Doctrine (Vol. I, pp. 550 et seq .), about the “lemniscate,” and also about the development of the germ-cell (Vol. II., pp. 117 et seq .). These Triangles produce Squares by their intersection, and we get the following series of points generated, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49, which is 1 2 , 2 2 , 3 2 , 4 2 , 5 2 , 6 2 and 7 2 . Thus are the Forty-nine Fires generated. At the fourth stage the primal type of the spindle is repeated, but as a duality ; in the two succeeding figures this duality is repeated but on a smaller and smaller scale until in Fig. 8, it disappears entirely . Let us now combine our previous figures and we obtain Fig. 9. All is generated from the Point (the First Logos). Thus from it we have six descending triangles and six spheres of matter, which together with the point make seven. So also with the fainter triangles and circles of spirit which ascend. And yet the two points of departure are essentially one in nature. The horizontal diameter is neither dark nor light, neither spirit nor matter, as is also the greatest circumscribing circle. Fig. 10 is the amplification of Fig. 7. It is the Pyramid unfolded , and the “Four-faced Brahm,” the “four Mah ∼ r ∼ jas,” etc., and all the quaternaries; it is also the expansion of the Tetraktys. Notice the two series of three Squares each and the Point in the centre, seven in all. Notice also that the Square of Twelve Fires is bounded by triangles of Ten . The representation of the Pythagorean Tetraktys was a triangle containing ten Y ∩ ds. Our figure being a perfect type, if the corners are folded to the central point, the Fires, or syzygies, coincide, and this process can be repeated until the whole figure disappears in the Point. But in nature the type is imperfect, and the Fires are at unequal distances, so that in folding over the four corners, the Solid Pyramid is formed, its spiritual axis and its material basal diameters varying with the proportion of spirit and matter in any manifestation.

In the Talmud and the Kabala , Eden is called “The Garden of Delight,” and held by the Church Fathers to figure Yoni after the commission of the first sin. The Gnostics, on the contrary, always explain the term in its most spiritual and metaphysical sense, treating of its cosmogonical and theogonical signification and ignoring its material and physiological explanation. In Adversum Celsum (vi. 30) * Origen with much verbiage and contempt treats of the “accursed diagram” of the Ophites, which his Gnostic opponent Celsus had referred to. In it, Gabriel is the fourth of the “ seven ruling Daim ō ns”, for we read: “Moreover, Celsus asserted that the ‘fourth had the form of an eagle’; the diagram representing him as Gabriel the Eagle-like.” In ancient Astrology, Gabriel was said to rule over the sign Taurus and the Moon. Now, the Egyptians, according to Plutarch† assigned to the moon a male and a female nature ( phusin arsenoth ‘ lun ). During the Lunus-Luna festival, at the Vernal Equinox, when the sun was in the sign Taurus, the men sacrificed to Lunus and the women to Luna, each sex assuming the dress of the other. The Bull (Taurus), moreover, among all the ancients was the symbol of generation, and in the symbolism of the Mithraic Mysteries, the Initiate plunges a sword or scimitar into the throat of a prostrate Bull. Compare this with The Voice of the Silence (pp. 11 and 12): “Before that path is entered, thou must destroy thy lunar body , cleanse thy mind-body and make clean thy heart . . . . .” “Before the ‘Mystic Power’ can make of thee a god, Lanoo, thou must have gained the faculty to slay thy lunar form at will .” When we collate all this with what is told us in The Secret Doctrine of the Pit \u0001 is and their work in the formation of the lower man, and of the bi-sexual or androgynous nature of the early races, we shall –––––––––– * [In A nte-Nicene Fathers , Vol. IV, p. 586.] † De Iside et Osiride , ch. 43, [In Plutarch’s Morals, tr. by C.

(2) [ Barb ‘ l ō .] In explaining this term, it will be interesting to see first of all what the other Gnostic systems say of Barb ē l ō and then to examine the statements in Pistis-Sophia . We learn from Irenaeus,* that the Innominable Father was manifested to this “never-aging Ae ō n in a virginal form” by the emanation of four beings, whose name expressed thought and life ; and that she, at the sight thereof, conceived and gave birth to three like beings. Compare with this:— “Then the three ( triangles ) fall into the four ( quaternary ). The radiant essence becomes Seven inside, Seven outside. The Luminous Egg ( HiraŠyagarbha ), which itself is Three ( the triple hypostases of Brahm ā , or VishŠu , the three ‘ Avasth ā s’ ), curdles and spreads in milk-white curds throughout the depths of Mother, the Root that grows in the depths of the Ocean of Life.” ( S.D. I, 66.) According to Epiphanius, one of the Ophite schools taught that Barb ‘ l ō was an emanation of the Father, and the Mother of Ialdaba ō th (or according to some, of Tseb āō th), which is to say that Barb ‘ l ō was identical with Sophia-Acham ō th or Pistis-Sophia. She dwelt in the Eighth Heaven above: while her son insolently possessed himself of the Seventh and caused his mother much lamentation. This idea is the common property of all the Gnostic systems, the terms varying, the idea remaining constant. She is further said to constantly appear to the Arch ō ns or Rulers, in a beautiful form, so that she may collect again her scattered power, stolen from her by the Demiurge, his Gods, Angels. and Daim ō ns. According to Irenaeus again, the ascent of souls terminated in the upper Region “where is Barb ē l ō the Mother of the Living (or Lives).”† Pistis-Sophia informs us that Barb ē l ō is one of the Triad of the Invisibles Agrammachamareg, Barb ē l ō"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"and Bdell ē , in the Region of the Left (see Table I), where is the Thirteenth Ae ō n (page 359). She is –––––––––– * A dversus Haereses , Book I, ch. xxix. [In Ante-Nicene Fathers , Vol. I, p. 353.] † [Wrongly ascribed to Irenaeus. Actually, Epiphanius , De Gemmis , ii, 20.] – ––––––––– C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA  25 twice called the Power ( d ynamis ) of the Invisible God; she is also the Mother of Pistis-Sophia and twenty-three other Emanations (pages 49, 361). The Region of the Left is apparently called the Hyl ē (Matter) of Barb ‘ l ō (page 128). Again, from Epiphanius,* we learn that one of the names of the Valentinians was Barb ‘ litae , and we are inclined to think with É. C. Amélineau in his Essai sur le Gnosticisme Égyptien (Paris, 1887), that it was the name of the highest degree of their Initiation, in which the Adept became a perfect Pneumatic, or Illuminatus, a son of Immortality. The Hebrew derivation would give the meaning, Son or Daughter of God. We know, on the other hand, that with the Gnostics and especially the Docetae (Illusionists), who held that Jesus, the man, was entirely distinct from Christos, the Principle, and denied the facts of the miraculous conception, incarnation, death, and resurrection—the mother of Jesus, the man, was considered as low, as the mother of Christos, the Principle, was held in veneration by them. The latter was the “Holy Ghost” and regarded as female by their schools. When we consider, however, that esoterically there are seven aspects of the Sophia (the seven planes of wisdom), it will be easy to see that both the Church Fathers, unintentionally, and the Gnostics, intentionally, only give one out of the seven aspects. (3) [ The great Tseb āō th, the good. ] In Pistis-Sophia there are three Tseb āō ths, that is to say three aspects of the power or principle hidden in this name. (a) The Great Tseb āō th, the Good, the “father” of the “soul” of Jesus (pages 14, 193): (b) The Little Tseb āō th, the Good, called in the Kosmos Zeus (Jupiter) (page 371),† one of the Planetary Rulers: and (c) Tseb āō th-Adamas, Ruler over six of the twelve Arch ō ns (page 360), and also in the Lower World, one of the Arch ō ns which have the punishment of Souls, whose “Receiver,” or subordinate, presents the Cup of Oblivion to reincarnating souls. In some of the schools it was taught that he who wished to be “Perfect” must ascend through the realms of the Rulers, and finally place his foot on the head of Tseb āō th; and thus attain the Eighth Heaven where dwelt Barb ē l ō . Tseb āō th was said to have a woman’s hair, and ––––––––––— * P anarion or Adversus Haereses , Book I, t.

Here we should call to mind the red ass of Typhon in the Egyptian Mysteries; the descent of Bacchus to Had ē s on an ass in the Frogs of Aristophanes (a burlesque on the Eleusinian Mysteries); the Golden Ass of Apuleius, and last but not least the entrance of “Jesus” into “Jerusalem” (the mundane Jerusalem in other words, physical existence) on an “ass.” In every case these terms are from the Mysteries and none but the “Perfect” knew their secret meaning. To the multitude they have ever remained “abracadabra” and will remain for all but the most determined students. Origen ( Adv. Cels ., vi, 31) gives the formulae of prayers recited by the Defunct, or Pneumatic, to the Planetary Rulers. These were probably part of the secrets of their outer initiation and used by the Bishop of Auch to show that he knew their secrets even better than Celsus himself. The passage referring to Tseb āō th, runs as follows: “They next come to Tseb āō th, to whom they think the following should be addressed: ‘O"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Governor of the fifth realm, powerful Tseb āō th, defender of the law of thy creation, which is liberated by grace, through the help of a more powerful Pentad , admit me, seeing the faultless symbol of thy art, preserved by a stamp of an image a body liberated by a Pentad. Let grace be with me. O Father let grace be with me’.” (4) [ Region of the right. ] Perhaps it will not be without interest if, in explanation of this term, we translate a few lines from the Adversus Haereses of Irenaeus, who was, perhaps, the bitterest of all the opponents of the Gn ō sis. The “holy” Father shall teach us the Knowledge he strove so vigorously to crush out of existence. In speaking of the Italian school of the Valentinians, Irenaeus writes:—“They declare that the Demiurge, having fashioned the Cosmos, made the Choïc (Material) Man also; but not from this dry Earth, but from the invisible Essence, from the fluid and unsettled portion of the Hyl ē , and that he breathed into him the Psychic (or astral Man ). And this is the Man which is born according to the image and likeness ( sc . the Chh ā y ā ), the Hylic being according to the image, resembling but not of the same Essence with the God (the Pit \u0001 is ), while the Psychic Man was in the likeness: whence also his Essence, being from a spiritual emanation is called a spirit of Life. It was afterwards they say that the Coat of Skin clothed him, which they declare is the body of flesh perceived by the senses . . . . so that they derive the Soul from the Demiurge, the Body from the Earth ( Choos ), and the Fleshly Covering from the Hyl ē ; But the Spiritual Man (Anthr ō pos) from the Mother of Acham ō th ( i.e. from Sophia-Above or Within, the Mother of Sophia-Without, or Pistis-Sophia) . . . . Of these three, they say that the Hylic, which C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA  27 they also call the L eft , must of necessity perish, in as much as it has in it no breath of incorruptibility; but the Psychic, which they designate the Right , being in the middle of the Spiritual and Hylic, goes in whatsoever direction it may incline itself; whereas the Spiritual ( Manas ) has been sent forth, in order that, by being united with the Psychic here ( i.e. , emanating K ā ma-Manas), it might take Form and be instructed together with it (the Psychic or K ā ma-R ū pa ) by sharing in its existence or by conversion with it (anastroph ‘ ).”* In the Pistis-Sophia the plane immediately below or inferior to the Treasure of Light is divided into three main Lokas or Sub-planes, the Right, the Left and the Middle. The duty of the Rulers of the Right is the forming, fashioning or building of all the lower Spheres or Planes of existence, by bringing down the Light out of its Treasury, and causing it to return thither again, thus in another sense, accomplishing the salvation of such souls as are fit to ascend to a higher plane. The Rulers of the Midst have the Guardianship of Human Souls. The Left, called also the Region of Righteousness, is the Loka or condition towards which all penitent souls tend, for it is here that the conflict between the principles of Light and Hyl ‘ ( i.e. , differentiation) first commences. From the words in italics in the preceding paragraph, we can see the type of Brahm ā , Vishnu. and ®iva , the Hindu Trim™ rti or Trinity, revealing itself; the ideas of Creation , Preservation , and Destruction or Regeneration being very clearly shown forth. In the System of Valentinus, we read of “the power of the psychic or soulish essence which is called the ‘Right’.” Tseb āō th also who dwells in the Right is an aspect of the Demiurge and the Creator of Souls. Before proceeding further, it is necessary to give a provisionary table to the Planes and Lokas according to the Pistis-Sophia . –––––––––– * A dversus Haereses , Book V, ch. v, sect. 5 & 6. –––––––––– 2 8  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS Ta ble I"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Vide S.D ., I, 200.

The ancients classed them under the generic term of Daemons . These Daemons were grouped in classes round the gods called Cosmic Deities, as they were called; that is to say, the gods which governed the visible world; they were its agents (Kosmokratores), just as their chiefs were those of the Super-celestial gods. Commissioned as they were to maintain the communication between the two worlds, they presided at the descent of souls from the higher regions to the inferior zone, and communicated to them during the present existence of trial and expiation, the gifts of divine life. They divided among themselves the 36 parts of the human body, and after their earthly career was finished, guided the souls in their return to the Supreme Being.”*"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"(8) [ Mixture .] Although it is impossible at present to give a complete and detailed table of the almost interminable synonyms of the terms, used in the scheme of the Pistis-Sophia , we are compelled at the risk of being thought tedious, to give some explanation of the strange nomenclature which meets us at every step.

The translation in Migne is “huit fois mille fois et sept fois cent foix,” and, as usual, no comment or elucidation is offered.

IEU, therefore, exalts them to a higher Region and brings them into a pure Air , into the Light of the Sun, amid the Region of the Midst, and of the Invisible Deity. Tseb āō th-Adamas and his Rulers, however, will not abstain from the Mystery of Intercourse; IEU, accordingly, confines them in the Sphere (of Fate?) in number 1800 (360 x 5) and above them 360 other Rulers, and above these again 5 great Rulers. Using the Astronomical key, IEU is the Spiritual Sun, the father of the Physical Sun, which again is the father of the “intra-mercurial planet.” See The Secret Doctrine , II, 28, and Part I, Transactions of the Blavatsky Lodge , p. 48. ( C.W. X, 340). C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA  35 The above description is taken from the fourth book or division of the P istis-Sophia , which R. A. Lipsius thinks, “has probably got by accident into the place where we now read it in the manuscript. It presents a simpler and older form of the Gnostic doctrine, and was the work perhaps of a different author.” However that may be, and as our effort is to understand the ideas of the Pistis-Sophia , it will be sufficient to remark that the above description is given by Jesus to his disciples when he had brought them, in their Initiation, “into the Middle Region of the Air , in the Paths of the Way of the Midst, which is below the Sphere,” and that, by analogy, it helps greatly the understanding of the “Conversion of the Rulers,” which follows. A hint to the explanation of the word “Tyrant” is given on page 76, where it speaks of “All the Tyrant Deities, which had not yet given up the purity of their Light .” Compare also pages 25, 137, and 154, and also PS 14 (3). In the Gn ō sis of the Ophites, the term “Adamas” is of frequent occurrence, and in Philosophumena , X, 9, we read that: “The Naaseni (a school of the Ophites) call Anthr ō pos (the Man), the First Principle of the Universe ( Arch ē n Universorum ), and also the Son of Man, and divide it into three. For in it, they say, is an Intelligent , a Psychic and a Choïc (Physical) Principle . And they call it Adamas , and think that the knowledge, which has it ( Adamas ) for its object, is the beginning of our being able to know Deity .” From the above it is evident that there are three Adamantes , of which our Adamas is the lowest."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"In connection with these “Tyrant Deities, which had not yet given up the purity of their Light,” and from which Jesus took a “ third part of their Power,” and in explanation of what follows in the text, students should compare Stanza vi, \u0001 loka 5, of The Secret Doctrine (Vol. I, 191 et seq .), “At the fourth (Round, or revolution of life and being around ‘the seven smaller wheels’), the sons are told to create their images.

The Hierarchy of the Emanations in the Treasure of Light, according to the first three books, consists of the Ineffable, called also the Deity of Truth, and the Inward of the Inward, and also of the Limbs (or Words) on the one hand, and on the other of the Mysteries of the Ineffable. At the head of all Mysteries stands the Mystery of the Ineffable or the First Mystery , called also the Only ( Unicum ) Word (or Logos) of the Ineffable. From this emanates the Only Mystery of the First Mystery, and thence Three, Five and Twelve other Mysteries. (6) I EU is called the Father of the Father of Jesus, the Father of Jesus being the Great Tseb ā ō th, the Good.† The Region of I EU is the Right, and the titles of this Principle are the Overseer of the Light, the First M an, the Legate of the First Statute‡ and the Guardian of the Veil.

We have, therefore restored the idea of the Gnostic writer by a study of passages in the Philosophumena , of which the following is an example:—“This, said he, is what was written: ‘ I have said, ye are all Gods, and children of the Highest, if ye shall hasten to flee out of Egypt, and crossing the Red Sea come into the Wilderness ,’ that is, from the Intercourse ( mixis ) below, to that of Jerusalem Above; ‘but if ye again return to Egypt,’ that is, to the Intercourse below, ‘ye die like men’ ( Ps . 82,6-7). For he said, all the inferior generation is mortal, whereas all that is generated above is immortal. For of Water [ Sc . the Water of Space] alone and Spirit, the Spiritual (Man) is generated, and not the Carnal. The Lower (Man) on the contrary, is Carnal: this is, said he, what was written: ‘ What is born of the Flesh is Flesh , and what is born of Spirit is Spirit .’ This is, according to them, the Spiritual generation. This, he said, is the Great Jordan, which flowing down, and hindering the Exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt (that is from the lower Intercourse; for Egypt is the body , according to them), was turned back , and made to flow upward by Jesus ” (V. § Naaseni).

The main feature of their"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"teaching was that the Christos descended on the man, Jesus, at his Baptism, but that Melchizedec was a heavenly power, higher than the Christos. That which the Christos was to do for men, Melchizedec did for Angels. This Melchizedec was without Father, or Mother, or descent, whose beginning and end were incomprehensible.

From the Pistis-Sophia (pages 292, 327-9, 337, 365), we learn that the three chief Deities of the Right are Ieu, Zorokothora Melchizedec, and the Great Tseb āō th, the Good. The office of Melchizedec, and of his Receivers, is to deprive the Rulers of their Light- Powers, and carry the Light back into the Treasure.

She was grieving also because of the vexations, which the Self-willed One caused her, which is one of those Three Triple-Powers, [PS 43] whose Mystery I will tell you, if I shall come to speak of their Emanation. “And when P ISTIS -S OPHIA saw me, changed into the most brilliant Light, she was in p erturbation; and gazing into the Light of my Vesture, she saw the Mystery of her own Name (2) therein, and the whole Splendour of her Mystery, in as much as she had been in the Beginning in the Region of the Height, in the Thirteenth Ae ō n . . . . .” 4 0  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS ( 1) [P ISTIS -S OPHIA .] The reader should carefully study the recital of the “Fall” of Sophia, as told in the P hilosophumena (p. 107) and compare it with the allegorical drama of the text which follows. It will be noticed that the first and last of the female Ae ō ns of the Dodecad, are respectively PISTIS and SOPHIA. The Soul was the one subject, and the knowledge of the Soul the one object of all the ancient Mysteries. In the “Fall” of PISTIS-SOPHIA, and her rescue by her Syzygy, JESUS, we see the ever-enacted drama of the suffering and ignorant Personality, which can only be saved by the immortal Individuality, or rather by its own yearning towards IT. In reading this portion of the Pistis-Sophia , the mysterious Duality of the Manas should always be remembered, and this key applied to every line. As Wisdom was the end of the Gn ō sis, so the pivot of the whole Gnostic teaching was the so-called “Sophia-Mythus.” For whether we interpret the allegory from the macro- or from the micro-cosmic stand. point, it is always the evolution of MIND, that the Initiates of old have sought to teach us. The emanation and evolution of Mahat in cosmogenesis, and of Manas in anthropogenesis, was ever the study of the One Science. The dwelling of Sophia was in the Midst, between the Upper and Lower Worlds, in the Ogdoad. Below was the Hebdomad or Seven Spheres, governed by seven Hierarchies of Rulers. Truly hath “Wisdom built for herself a House, and rested it on Seven Pillars” ( Proverbs ix, 1 and again: “She is on the lofty Heights; she stands in the midst of the Paths , for she taketh her seat by the Gates of the Powerful Ones (the Rulers), she tarrieth at the Entrances” ( Ibid ., viii, 2). Moreover, Sophia was the Mediatrix between the Upper and Lower Region, and at the same time projected the Types or Ideas of the Pl ē r ō ma into the Universe. Now, why should Sophia, who was originally of a Pneumatic or Spiritual Essence, be in the Middle Space, an exile from her true Dwelling? Such was the great mystery which the Gn ō sis endeavoured to solve. Seeing again"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"that this “Fall of the Soul” from its original purity involved it in suffering and misery, the object that the Gnostic teachers had ever before them, was identical with the problem of “Sorrow,” which Gautama ® ā kyamuni set himself to resolve. Moreover, the solution of the two systems was identical in that they traced the Cause of Sorrow to Ignorance, and to remove this, pointed out the Path to Self-knowledge. The Mind was to instruct the Mind: “self-analyzing reflection” was to be the Way. The Material Mind (K ā ma-Manas) was to be purified and so become one with the Spiritual Mind (Buddhi-Manas). In the nomenclature of the Gnosis, this was expressed by the Redemption of Sophia by the Christos, who delivered her from her ignorance ( agnoia ) and sufferings. It is not then C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA  41 surprising that we should find Sophia, whether regarded as a unity, or as a duality, or again as c osmic mind, possessed of many names. Among these may be mentioned the Mother, or All-Mother, Mother of the Living or Shining Mother; the Power Above; the Holy Spirit (all from the macrocosmic standpoint); and again She of the Left-hand, as opposed to Christos, He of the Right-hand; the Man-woman; Prounikos or the Lustful-one; Matrix; Paradise; Eden; Acham ō th; the Virgin; Barb ‘ lo; Daughter of Light; Merciful Mother; Consort of the Masculine One; Revelant of the Perfect Mysteries; Perfect Mercy; Revelant of the Mysteries of the whole Magnitude; Hidden Mother; She who knows the Mysteries of the Elect; the Holy Dove, which has given birth to the two Twins ; Ennoia; Ruler; and The Lost or Wandering Sheep, Helena. In the Valentinian System, Sophia gives birth to the Christos “ with a Shadow .” The above terms are taken from Smith and Wace’s Dictionary of Christian Biography , art. “Sophia,” where we read: “In the Syriac text of the Acts published by Dr. Wright ( Apocryphal Acts of Apostles , pp. 238-245) we find the beautiful Hymn of the Soul , which has been sent down from her heavenly home to fetch the pearl guarded by the serpent , but has forgotten here below her heavenly mission till she is reminded of it by a letter from ‘ the father , the mother , and the brother ,’ performs her task, receives back again her glorious dress , and returns to her old home.” (2) [ Name .] The Name, which is no name , but a Sound or rather Motion . The mystery of the Logos, Verbum and V ā ch has ever been concealed in the mystery of Names . These Names, in whatever tongue, or among whatever people, all represent permutations of the “Ineffable Name.” In this connection, the following passage from the Pistis-Sophia (page 378, 379) is of great interest.

(Thus th en) they cast her forth into Chaos. And in Chaos was the Ruler with the appearance of a Lion, of which the one-half is Flame, and the other half Mist, which is Ialdaba ō th (1), of which I have spoken to you many times.” _________________________________________________________________________ (1) Ialdaba ō th is identical with the Pthahil of the Codex Nazaraeus the Demiurge of the Valentinian system, the Proarchos of the Barb ē litae,* the Great Arch ō n of Basilides and the El ō him of Justinus, etc. Ialdaba ō th (the Child of Chaos) was the son of Sophia (Acham ō th) in the Gnostic Cosmogenesis, in other words, the Chief of the Creative Forces and the representative of one of the classes of Pitris. If we regard the Sophia-Above [see “Valentinus” passim] as the šk ā \u0001 a , and the Sophia-Below (Acham ō th) as its lower or material planes, we shall be able to understand why Ialdaba ō th, the material creator, was identified with Jehovah and Saturn, and so follow out the following allegory from Irenaeus.† Ialdaba ō th the child of the Mother, Sophia, generates a son of himself, without the assistance of any mother, and his son a son in his turn, and he another, and so on until there are six sons generated, one from another. Now these immediately commenced to strive with their father for the mastery; and he in despair and rage gazed into the “purgations of matter” below; and through them begot another son, Ophiomorphos, the serpent-formed, the spirit of all that is basest in matter. Then being puffed up with pride, he stretched himself over his highest sphere, and"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"proclaimed aloud. “I am Father and God, and there is none above me.” On this, his mother cried out: “Lie not, Ialdaba ō th, for the Father of All, the First Anthr ō pos (man), is above thee, and so is Anthr ō pos, the Son of Anthr ō pos.”‡ And Ialdaba ō th to prevent his sons attending to the voice, –––––––––– * Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses , Book I, ch. xxix, 4. † Op . cit ., Book I, ch. xxiii-xxviii. ‡ Op . cit ., Book I, ch. xxx, 6. –––––––––– 4 4  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS p roposed that they should fashion a man . So the six of them made a gigantic man, who lay on the earth and writhed like a worm (the man of the first rounds and races). And they brought him to his father Ialdaba ō th, who breathed into him the “Breath of Life,” and thus emptied himself of his creative power . And Sophia aided the design, so that she might regain the Light-powers of Ialdaba ō th. Forthwith the man, having the divine spark, aspired to the Heavenly Man, from whom it came. At this Ialdaba ō th grew jealous, and generated Eve ( L...l...th ) to deprive Adam of his Light-powers. And the six “Stellars,” empassioned of her beauty, begot sons through her. Thereupon Sophia sent the serpent (intelligence) to make Adam and Eve transgress the precepts of Ialdaba ō th, who in rage, cast them down out of Paradise into the World, together with the serpent (fourth round and fourth race). At the same time, she deprived them of their Light-power, that it might not come under the “curse” as well. And the serpent reduced the world-powers under its sway, and generated six sons, who continually oppose the human race, through which their father (the serpent) was cast down. Now Adam and Eve in the beginning had pure spiritual bodies, which gradually became grosser and grosser . Their spirit too became languid, for they had nought but the breath of the lower world, which Ialdaba ō th had breathed into them. In the end, however, Sophia gave them back their Light-power and they awoke to the knowledge that they were naked. This suggestive allegory, wherein the creature became higher than the creator, can only be understood by remembering the identity of essence of that which is evolved, with that from which it is evolved. Compare: “I have clothed myself in thee, and thou art my V ā hana to the Day ‘Be with us’, when thou shalt rebecome myself and others, thyself and me” ( The Secret Doctrine , I, Stanza vii, ®loka 7) . In this cycle of emanation that which is above becomes that which is below, so that we find in Pistis-Sophia that Ialdaba ō th is finally spoken of as residing in the “Great Chaos which is the Outer Mist,” where, with his Forty-nine Daemons, he tortures wicked souls (page 382). Moreover the resemblance between Ialdaba ō th and Tseb āō th-Adamas is so close, that they are evidently to be regarded as aspects of the same power; the peculiar richness of the terminology of the Pistis-Sophia renders such correspondences a necessity. In the Chart of the Ophites of which Origen speaks in his Contra Celsum , there are two septenates of Planetary Rulers, a superior and inferior Hebdomad. Ialdaba ō th is the first of the Superior Group, and Michael-Ophiomorphos at the head of the inferior. Now this Michael is called the “ Lion-like ,” and is the son of Ialdaba ō th who is also C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA  45 represented as lion-headed. In the formulae of prayers for the “Defunct,” the Soul, after having crossed the R ampart of Wickedness ( phragmon kakias ), the dominion of Ophiomorphos, or our terrestrial plane, arrives at the Gates of Ialdaba ō th and utters the following adulatory address, which in truth seems little applicable to the nature of Ialdaba ō th. “O thou, who art born to rule with boldness, Ialdaba ō th, first and seventh , O ruler,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"subsistent Logos of a pure mind, perfect work for Son and Father, bringing to thee the token of Life (marked) with the stamp of the type, I open the gate, which thou hast closed to thy Ae ō n, the world, and pass by thy authority again in freedom. May grace be with me; Yea, may it be, Father.” [ PS 63] “. . . . . Because of the uproar of the fear and power of the Self-willed One, my P ower has failed me. I [Pistis-Sophia] am become like a separated Daim ō n ( idios d aim ō n ) dw elling in Hyl ē , in which there is no Light, and I am become like the Counterfeit of the Spirit (1), which is in the Hylic Body, in which there is no Power of Light; and I am become like as a Decan alone in the Air (2). The Projections of the Self-willed One compressed me mightily. And my Syzygy said to itself: ‘Instead of the Light, which was in her, they have filled her with Chaos.’ I have devoured the Sweat of my own Hyl ē , and the An g uish of the Tears of the Hyl ē of my Eyes (3), that they, who afflict me, might not t ake what remains. . . . .” ___________________________________________________________________ (1) The Counterfeit of the Spirit ( An timimon pneumatos ), is one of the principles in the formation of the Soul, in which fabrication, each of the five Planetary Rulers has his share. This work is completed by administering to the Soul the Draught of Forgetfulness, or Lethe-potion, which is brewed from the Sperm of Evil, and incites men to all material lusts; this is the evil genius of man, a sort of spiritual substance surrounding the Soul. (2) [ Decan alone in the Air .] Compare page 107, “I am like as Hyl ē , which is sunken; they have driven me hither and thither, like as a Daemon in the Air.” The Middle Region of the Air is spoken of as in the Paths of the Way of the Midst, which is below the Sphere.

Amélineau in his Essai sur le Gnosticisme Egyptien , p. 303, in tracing this idea through Egyptian imagery, writes as follows: “Among the invocations addressed to the Sun, or rather in the enumeration of his various transformations, we read the following: ‘He who creates the water, which issues from his interior, the image of the body of Remi , the weeper.’ ‘Tears play an important part in the Egyptian religion,’ says É. Naville, in explaining this text, ‘and especially in that which concerns creation.’ He then quotes several examples taken from unpublished texts from the tomb of Rameses IV, which we borrow from him. In one of these the God is prayed to as, the ‘weeper,’ and asked to give life to the ‘king’; ‘O weeper, thou powerful one, high in the realms of Aukert, give life to the King’ . . . . He also receives this invocation: ‘O thou, he who forms himself by his tears, who hears himself his own words, who reanimates his soul, reanimate the soul of the King.’ Finally in a famous text known as the text of the four races, men are thus addressed: ‘Ye are a tear of my eye in your name of Retu, that is to say, in your name of men’ . . . . This doctrine is still more clearly affirmed in a magic papyrus translated by Dr. Birch, where the tears of different Gods are represented as the matter from which issue flowers, incense, bees, water, salt, etc. ‘When Horus weeps’, says the papyrus, ‘the water which falls from his eyes, grows into plants, which produce a sweet perfume. When Su and Tefnut weep greatly, and water falls from their eyes, it changes into plants which produce incense . . . .

The fragments are also called Acts of the Lord’s Boyhood , and are replete with the foolish and childish incidents which are so frequent in the Gospel of the Infancy . These fables, however, were in such favour among Catholic readers, that the gospel was dressed up to suit orthodox taste by cutting out all heretical passages. Still, the Gnostic tendency of the fragments is shown by their strong Docetism, that is to say the theory that the appearance of the Christos as man was an illusion.

We find, in short, that the higher Angels had broken, countless ae ō ns before, through the ‘Seven Circles,’ and thus robbed them of their Sacred fire; which means in plain words, that they had assimilated during their past incarnations, in lower as well as in higher worlds, all the wisdom therefrom—the reflection of M AHAT in its various degrees of intensity.” T he Secret Doctrine , II, 80.

Again the Sons of Isr ā ‘ l crossed the Red Sea and came into the Desert ( i.e. , by parturition were born into the world), where are the gods of destruction and the god of salvation. The former are they which inflict the necessity of changeable birth on those who are born into the world. These are the Serpents of the Desert, and it was in order that the Sons of Isr ā ‘ l might escape the bites of these Powers that Moses showed them the True and Perfect Serpent . (V, 16). In the system of Justinus the first triad consists of The Good Principle, the El ō h ī m and Eden or Isr ā ‘ l, the latter being considered as feminine and figured as a Virgin above and a Viper below; she is the Spouse of the El ō h ī m. The passage of Isaiah (i, 2-3): “Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken . . .

The fourth is Φ Φ Φ and its in terpretation is NNN.” Now Ψ = 700 and 0 = 70, Φ = 500 and N = 50; therefore, as 10 is the “radix” of n umbers, 70 interprets 700 and 50, 500, as every higher plane interprets the lower. “The fifth is a nd its interpretation is A A A.” In other words the interpretation of 4 is 1, just as that of \b or 8 is also 1, for whether we count by threes or sevens , the fourth and the eighth will always be the first or the next class,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"plane, degree, emanation, or whatever we choose to call it. The next mystery, approaching the end of the cycle of evolution, differentiates the original triple triad into a triple quaternary, and having thus added to its experience returns into the silence of the Great Name. When the key of the seven planes and principles has been understood, it will be easy to place the seven on the lower four planes of a higher septenary, as in the diagram in the S . D ., and then we shall see how the type of the three highest ar  pa planes is reflected in the seven planes of the lower four. [ PS 127] “. . . . . Thou art the First Mystery, Looking-without . . . thou hast come upon the Vesture of Light, which thou didst receive from Barb ‘ l ∩ , which (Vesture) is Jesus, our Saviour, on which thou didst descend as a Dove” (1). C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA  55 (1) [ D ove .] See PS 1 (4). In the system of Marcus ( Philos . VI, § 47), the Dove is said to correspond to A and \b , for the explanation of which see P S 125 (1). In the system of Cerinthus ( Philos ., VII, § 33), we read: “Cerinthus, who was practiced in the training of the Egyptians, said that the world was not made by the first God, but by a certain power which was separated from the authority which was over the universe, and it knew not the deity which was over all. He laid down, moreover, that Jesus was not born of a Virgin, but that a son was born to Joseph and Mary like all other men, but that he was more righteous and wise (than the rest). And after his baptism, the Christos descended upon him from the principle which is absolute over all, in the form of a dove , and then he preached the unknowable father , and perfected his powers ; but towards the end, the Christos flew away from Jesus; and Jesus suffered and rose again, whereas the Christos remained untouched by suffering, for it was essentially of a spiritual nature.” The Christos is the glorified individuality, i . e ., Manas-Taijas, or the Higher Manas with the glory of Buddhi upon it, whereas Jesus is the perishable personality of the Lower Manas. It will be useful in this connection to compare what The Secret Doctrine says of “the mythical white swan, the swan of Eternity or Time, the K ∼ lahansa” (I, 78). Hansa or “Hamsa is equal to ‘ aham-sa ’, three words meaning ‘I am he’ (in English), while divided in still another way it will read ‘ so-ham ’, ‘he (is) I’— soham being equal to sah , ‘he,’ and aham , ‘I’, or ‘I am he’. In this alone is contained the universal mystery, the doctrine of the identity of man’s essence with god-essence, for him who understands the language of wisdom. Hence the glyph of, and the allegory about, K ∼ lahansa (or hamsa), and the name given to Brahma, neuter (later on, to the male Brahm ∼ ) of ‘Hamsa-V ∼ hana’, he who uses the Hamsa as his vehicle. The same word may he read ‘Kal-aham-sa’ or ‘I am I’ in the eternity of Time, answering to the Biblical, or rather Zoroastrian ‘I am that I am.’” ( S . D ., I, 78. ) Again in The Voice of the Silence (Fragment 1, p. 5), we read: “Saith the Great Law:—‘In order to become the KNOWER of ALL SELF* thou has first of SELF to be the knower.’ To reach the knowledge of th at SELF, thou hast to give up Self to Non-Self, Being to Non-Being, and then thou canst repose between the wings of the GREAT ——————— * The T attvajñ  nin is the “knower” or discriminator of the principles in nature and in man; } tmajñ ∼ nin is the knower of } TMAN or the Universal, ONE SELF. ——————— 56  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"BIRD.

T he Logoi or “Saviours” of all nations are represented as treading on the head or heads of a serpent or dragon, or as transfixing the monster with their several weapons of power.

K \u0001 ishna crushes the seven-headed serpent Kalinaga. Hercules lops off the heads of the Hydra, the water serpent: the Egyptian Orante treads upon the serpent, while his arms are extended on a crucifix, and Horus pierces the head of the Dragon Typhon or Apophis; the Scandinavian Thor smashes the skull of the snake with his cruciform hammer, and Apollo transfixes the Python, etc., etc. All this signifies from one aspect the extension of the planes of consciousness and the corresponding domination of the planes of matter (symbolically, water) of which there are fundamentally seven. “Like the Logoi and the Hierarchies of Powers, however, the ‘Serpent’s’ have to be distinguished one from the other. ® esha or Ananta, the ‘couch of VishŠu’ is the allegorical abstraction, symbolizing infinite Time in Space, which contains the germ and throws off periodically the efflorescence of this germ, the manifested Universe; whereas the Gnostic Ophis contained the same triple symbolism in its seven vowels as the One, Three, and Seven-syllabled Oeaohoo of the Archaic doctrine; i . e ., the One Unmanifested Logos, the Second manifested, the triangle concreting into the Quaternary or Tetragrammaton, and the days of the latter on the material plane.” ( S . D ., I, 73 footnote). Thus while Kwan-Shih-Yin or Avalokite \u0001 vara in Chinese symbology is crowned with seven dragons and hears the inscription, “the universal Savior of all living beings” ( S . D ., I, 471), the seven-headed Basilisk of the text of course typifies a lower and material aspect of this type of emanation of the universe, and not the primordial spiritual serpent with its glory of seven rays, or seven vowels. As there was a higher Hebdomad of seven supreme planetary spirits or Ae ∩ ns, so there was a lower Hebdomad. The Ophites allegorised this by saying that the Serpent, in punishment for teaching Adam and Eve (the 3rd race) to rebel against Ialdaba ∩ th (the spirit of the Earth or gross matter), was cast down into the lower world and produced six sons, i . e ., had to incarnate in the bodies of the early races. In almost all the systems, the common postulate of ancient astronomy that there were seven planetary spheres and an eighth (that of the fixed stars) above them, was taught in various allegorical garbs, all shadows of the esoteric truth of the seven states of matter, the seven Globes of a Planetary Chain, the seven Principles in man, etc., etc. The doctrine of the seven heavens is plainly set forth in an interesting apocryphal book called the Ascension of Isaiah which undoubtedly dates back earlier than the second century A.D. , and was frequently 58  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS qu oted with approbation up to the time of St. Jerome. It is marked by strong docetic tendencies, and belongs to the Judaeo-coptic school. After long silence it was brought into notice by Bishop Richard Laurence in 1819, who published the Ethiopic MS., the only codex extant, with a Latin and English version. Further light was thrown on this interesting relic by the work of A. Dillman (Leipzig, 1877), who compared the Bodleian MS. with two others which were brought from Magdala after its capture in 1868. In this treatise a curious vision of the prophet is described. An angel of the seventh heaven conducts the spirit of Isaiah through the seven heavens. In the firmament ( sc . the earth) he sees Samm ∼‘ l (Satan) and his hosts engaged in internecine conflict. In the first is one sitting on a throne ( V ∼ hana or vehicle*) and angels on"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"the right and left glorifying. Isaiah is told that this adoration is in reality offered to the Father in the seventh heaven and to his Beloved. In the second the same is seen, but on a scale of greater magnificence, and the prophet is again prevented from worshipping by the words: “Adore not, neither the angel nor the throne which are in the six heavens, till I have shown thee the seventh heaven.” Thus were the third, fourth, and fifth heavens shown each surpassing the other in magnificence. In the sixth was no throne, neither was there any division of left and right , but all in equal glory were praising the Father, his Beloved (Christ) and the Holy Ghost. Finally in the seventh, he sees the Father and “the Lord God, Christ who is called in the world Jesus,” and the angel of the Holy Spirit. There are all the Just † worshipping the three, while Jesus and the Holy Ghost worshipped the Father. Later on we read of the descent of Christ through the seven heavens and firmament prior to his incarnation. (see Dict . of Christ . Biog ., sub voce I SAIAH .) For a full c omprehension of this vision compare the diagrams in The Secret Doctrine , I, 153 and 200. Now although the seven-headed serpent is found sometimes above and sometimes below the figure of the God or Initiate in symbology, and again has 1, 3, 5, 12, or l,000 heads, yet in reality there is no confusion. For as the 1, 3, 5, and 7 primordial planes have their own sub-stages of emanation, so are the groupings and Hierarchies reflected each in the other. Therefore each plane is septenary and every pair of planes represents an upper and lower Hebdomad. ——————— * Every principle and plane is the vehicle of the next superior one: thus the Throne of Satan (the earth) is said to be the Footstool of God. † That is the “Perfect” or initiated: those Jñ ∼ nis who have either attained final freedom, or can pass into the Tur ♣ ya State of Sam ∼ dhi. ——————— C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA  59 It is also interesting to notice with regard to the Thirteenth Ae ∩ n and P ISTIS -S OPHIA standing on the s even-headed Basilisk, that in the Mexican tradition there are thirteen serpent Gods.

P ISTIS -S OPHIA . . . cried out again, saying: “. . . they oppressed me and took away my Power from me, and cast me into Orcus (1), deprived of my Light. . . .” _______________________________________________________________________________ ( 1) Orcus . The Underworld (See Table I) has three divisions, Orcus, Chaos and the Outer Darkness. In the allegorical descriptions of the fate of sinning souls, in other words, the fate of the lower principles after death, we are informed that in Orcus ( lit . a prison or enclosure), souls are tormented with Fire, in Chaos with Fire, Darkness and smoke; and in the Caligo Externa with added Hail, Snow, Ice, and cruel Cold. This would make these three lokas represent the states of matter corresponding to K ∼ ma-R  pa (Body of Desire), LiŠga-®ar...ra (Astral Body) and Sthula ®ar...ra (Physical Body). Therefore, when we read “they cast me into Orcus deprived of my Light,” we naturally can understand that the K ∼ ma principle would of necessity dull the Light of the spiritual principles and deprive them of their power. [ PS 150] Thereupon Thomas came forward and said: “Thy Power of Light prophesied of old through Solomon . . . . .

The 139 pages which deal with the subject demand the closest attention of the student of Esotericism, for not only have we here a history of the “pilgrimage” of the Soul, but also a description of the degrees of Initiation which correspond both to the natural degrees or states of consciousness, and to the cycles of human evolution. We will now endeavour to review this Pilgrimage of P ISTIS -S OPHIA , following the path of her “transgression” or desire for Light, through her 13 Repentances, or Changes of Mind ( Metanoiae , changes of the Nous or Manas ), until her restoration to the Thirteenth Ae ∩ n , her proper region or plane. To attain to the knowledge of Light, or the Logos, the soul has to descend into Matter or Hyl ‘ . Hence P ISTIS - S OPHIA , desiring the Light, descends towards its Re flection from the Thirteenth Ae ∩ n, through the Twelve Ae ∩ ns, into the depths of Chaos, where she is in danger of entirely losing her own innate Light or Spirit, of which she is continually deprived by the Powers of Matter. Having descended to the lowest depths of Chaos, she at length reaches the limit, and the path of her pilgrimage begins to lead upward to Spirit again. Thus she reaches the Balance ; and still yearning for the Light, rounds the turning-point of the cycle, and changing the tendency of her thought or mind, recites her penitential hymns or Repentances. Her chief enemy who, with his false Light , has drawn her down into Chaos, is Ialdaba ∩ th, the Power with the appearance of a Lion , the K ∼ ma “principle”, the false “Light`’ in Chaos, which is assisted by the 24 Hylic or Material Projections, or Emanations, the reflections of the 24 Supernal Projections, the co-partners of P ISTIS - S OPHIA , 48 in all, which together with that power or aspect from which the whole may at any time be vie wed, ——————— * [Genesis iii, 21.] See P S 107, footnote. ———————"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"PHILIP A.

At the 4th of these, the turning-point of a sub-cycle, she p rays that the Image of Light may not be turned from her, for the time was come when the Repentance of “those who turn in the Lowest Regions” should be regarded, “the mystery which is made the Type of the Race.” (4th Round.) At the 6th the Light ( Upper Manas ) remits her transgression, in that she quitted her own Region and fell into Chaos; but the command had not yet come from the First Mystery ( Buddhi ) to free her entirely from Chaos. Therefore at the conclusion of her 7th Repentance, where she pleads that she has done it in ignorance through her love for the Light, Jesus, the Initiate on the objective plane and the Light on the subjective plane, without the command of the First Mystery ( i . e ., the power of Manas alone"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"without Buddhi ), raises her up to a slightly less confined region in Chaos, but S OPHIA still k new not by whom it was done . At the 9th Repentance the First Mystery partly accepted her prayer and sent Jesus, the Light, to help her secretly, that is, without the powers of the Ae ∩ ns knowing it; then did P ISTIS - S OPHIA r ecognize the Light . Her next 4 Hymns are sung knowingly to the Light , and are of the nature of thanksgiving, and of declaration that Karmic Justice shall shortly overtake her oppressors, while she prays to be delivered from her “transgression,” viz ., the K ∼ mic Power with the appearance of a Lion. After the 13th Repentance, Jesus again, of himself , without the First Mystery, emanated a brilliant Power of Light from himself, and sent it to aid S OPHIA , to raise her higher still in Chaos, until the command should come to free her entirely.† Next follows a description of the Light-powers which should be closely compared with the description of the 3 Vestures in the opening pages of the Codex. Then while S OPHIA pours forth h ymns of joy, the Power becomes a Crown to her head , and her Hyl ‘ or material propensities begin to be purified, while the spiritual or Light-powers which she has still retained, join themselves with the “Vesture of Light” which has descended upon her. Then was the Statute fulfilled, and the First Mystery, in its turn, sent forth a great Power of Light, which joined with the first Power emanated by the “Light,” and became a great Stream of Light , this Power was the First Mystery itself Looking-without ( Buddhi-Manas ) on its own plane and the “glorified” Initiate — —————— * Compare the list of 25 T attvas (24 + 1 or from another aspect 5 x 5) in the article entitled “The Hindu Theory of Vibration as the Producer of Sounds, Forms and Colors,” The Theosophist , Vol. XII, October and November, 1880, written by C.

It came forth from the First Mystery L ooking-within ( } tma-Buddhi ) or “the Father.” When this is accomplished, P ISTIS - S OPHIA , the L ower Manas , is purified again, and her Light-powers are strengthened and filled with Light, by their own co-partner of Light that Syzygy , without whom P ISTIS - S OPHIA in the beginning thought she could reach the Light of Lights, and so fell into error. S till she is not even yet entirely freed from the bonds of Matter, for the higher she rises, the stronger are the Powers of Projections sent against her, who proceed to change their shapes , so that she now has to struggle against still greater foes which are emanated and directed by the strongest and subtlest Powers of Matter. Thereupon, P ISTIS - S OPHIA is surrounded entirely with the Stream of Light and further supported on either hand by Michael and Gabriel, the “Sun” and “Moon.” The “Wings” of the “Great Bird” flutter, the “Winged Globe” unfolds its pinions, preparatory to its flight. For is not the Infinitude of Space “the Nest of the Eternal Bird, the flutter of whose wings produces life”? ( S . D ., II, 293). Thus the last great battle commences. The First Mystery Looking-without, directs its attack against the “cruel crafty powers, passions incarnate” and causes P ISTIS - S OPHIA to tread underfoot the Basilisk with the seven heads, d estroying its Hyl ‘ , “ So that no seed could arise from it henceforth ,” and casting down the rest of the opposing host.* Thereupon P ISTIS - S OPHIA sings Hymns of Praise on her being loosed from the bonds of C haos. Thus was she set free and remembered . Yet the Great Self-willed One and Adamas, the Tyrant, were not yet entirely subdued, for the command had not yet come from the First Mystery, Looking-within, the Father. Therefore does the First Mystery, Looking-without, seal their regions and those of their Rulers until 3 times are completed.

To all below it the Treasure of Light is a unity; and its Orders, Projections, etc., in other words its Hierarchies have but one influence. Therefore, when the contents of the Treasure are mentioned at an earlier period of instruction, as on page 18, they are simply stated without order. But now, a further veil is withdrawn, and the Treasure becomes the Inheritance of Light; this will be when the Evolution of Cosmos is completed, and by analogy at the end of a Round, or of seven Rounds, or again in Initiation when the plane of consciousness called the Treasure is reached by the neophyte. Then, just as Jesus in his passage to the Height, (pages 25 to 37) turned six of the Ae ∩ ns to the Right and six to the Left, so will the Initiated enter into the Treasure and with their higher consciousness perceive its differences; thus will there be a Right and Left even in that which was previously supposed to be beyond such division. The Ordering of the Inheritance then presented will be as follows:— T ABLE IV I NHERITANCE OF L IGHT R IGHT L EFT ( S uperior) ( Inferior) 7 Amens (or Voices) 5 Trees } 12 Saviours 3 Amens { 9 Guardians o f 3 Gates Twin Saviours C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA   65"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"This table is arranged in parallel columns to show the correspondences, and arrows placed to mark the superiority and inferiority of the Orders.

These correspond to the 5 Subtle and 5 Gross Elements which, together with the 2 unmanifested elements, make up 12. Perhaps the following quotation from Professor Manilal Nabhubhai Dvivedi’s Monism or Advaitism ? will make it clearer:— “The Advaita begins with examining the divisions of Prakriti and clearly demonstrates, perhaps for the first time in the field of ancient Indian Rationalism, the truth that the five elements— } k ∼∇ a , V ∼ yu , Tejas , Jala , P \u0001 ithiv... —are but five states of prak \u0001 iti derivable from one another.

As illusions, we are separate distinct b odies living in masks furnished by M ∼ y ∼ . Can we claim one single atom in our body as distinctly our own? Everything, from spirit to the tiniest particle, is part of the whole, at best a link. Break a single link and all passes into annihilation; but this is impossible. There is a series of vehicles becoming more and more gross, from spirit to the densest matter, so that with each step downward and outward we get more and more the sense of separateness developed in us. Yet this is illusory, for if there were a real and complete separation between any two human beings, they could not communicate with, or understand each other in any way. “Thus with these hierarchies. Why should we separate their classes in our mind, except for purposes of distinction in practical Occultism, which is but the lowest form of applied Metaphysics? But if you seek to separate them on this plane of illusion, then all I can say is, that there exists between these Hierarchies the same abysses of distinction as between the ‘principles’ of the Universe or those of man, if you like, and the same ‘principles’ in a bacillus.”* The careful student on comparing the different tables already given, will perceive a certain unity in the multiplicity of the Hierarchies; in other words that they are built up on an ever recurring type, which has been given in its simplest form in the Chart of the Valentinian Pl ‘ r ∩ ma. Each new category transcends the one preceding it, until the mind totters in the sublimity of this stupendous scheme. The recurrence of the number l2 is remarkable and will receive further explanation in that part of our text which deals with the astrological portion of the system. For the present it will be sufficient to add two more facts in nature to what has been said in PS 198 (1), and invite the attention of the reader to the consideration of:— ( a ) The Dodecahedron , that marvellous “Platonic Solid”, for the solution of the Mysteries of which the whole of the Elements of Geometry were designed.

The commendatory prayer, recited at the moment of death to protect the soul of the deceased as it traverses the “middle passage,” also transmits the same hereditary germ. As usual, the older churches have preserved the occult tradition with greater fidelity than their inconoclastic and more ignorant younger sister. Occult science teaches that the frame of mind in which a man dies, is of the utmost importance owing to the abnormal and psychic state in which he then is. The last thought of a dying person does much to influence his immediate future. The arrow is ready to fly from the bow; the bow-string is abreast of the ear, and the aim will decide the immediate fate of the arrow. Happy is he for whom “Om is the bow, the Self is the arrow, the Brahman—its aim!” ( MuŠdaka -Upanishad II, ii, 4). At such a sacred moment, strong spiritual aspirations, whether natural or induced by the earnest exhortation of either one who has a true conviction, or better still, of one possessed of the divine Gn ∩ sis, will protect the Soul of him who is leaving life. This is not meant, however, to endorse the superstition of a “death-bed repentance,” for the immutable justice C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA  75 and harmony of the Karmic Law can only return a fleeting effect for a fleeting cause; and the rest of the K armic debt must be paid in future earth-lives. “Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"thou be cast into prison .

Otherwise, at death we shall be judged by our own Higher Self, and under the conduct of the agents of the Karmic Law (the Demiourgos collectively), will have to reincarnate again into the prison of the body, until the past evil Karma has been exhausted.

These are the septenary leaves of the Book of the Recording Angel, Le Livre de la Conscience , whither are instantly transferred the deeds, words and THOUGHTS of every minute of our lives, the Karmic record of each imprisoned soul. In the early portion of our text, we learned how the Initiate donned the spotless Vesture of Light containing the Five Words of Glory, and how they were potent to open all the portals and traverse all the Regions of the Rulers. So also with every man. Each has his own vesture, reflecting his Karmic record, and “uttering the words” that will acquit or condemn him before the jealous guardians of nature’s inmost realms. Yes; each of us has a vesture woven by his own hands, but few are they who are clad in a “wedding garment” and fit to join in the Marriage Feast, when the King ’ s Son is united to his Heavenly Bride ; in other words, to join that holy Brotherhood where each, to gain admittance, must be at one with the Christos within him. He who seeks admission in sin-soiled robes must, like the man in the parable ( Matt ., xxii) be cast forth into the “outer darkness” of earth-life, until he has learnt by the experience of suffering to weave for himself a garment worthy of the “Church (Assembly) of the Mystic Christ.” Thus, then, the Souls of the Dead have to present, each severally, their Defences., Denials, and Tokens, as the text has it, and the nature of their after-death experiences and their subsequent return to earth-life will depend upon which of the seven Virgins they have to face in the “Hall of Judgment.” Thrice blessed is he who, clad in the Vesture of Glory, can pass by the Guardians of every threshold. The above will throw much light on the Mysteries of the Osirified and the fate of the “defunct” that play so conspicuous a part in the “Wisdom of the Egyptians.” To give one instance out of a multitude: “In the book called by Champollion La Manifestation à la Lumière , there is a chapter on the Ritual which is full of mysterious dialogues, with addresses to various ‘Powers’ by the soul. Among these dialogues there is one which is more than expressive of the potentiality of the Word. The scene is laid in the ‘Hall of the Two Truths.’ The ‘Door,’ the ‘Hall of Truth,’ and even the various parts of the gate, address the soul which presents itself for admission. They all forbid it entrance unless it tells them their mystery, or mystic names.” ( Isis Unveiled , II, 369.) [ PS 241-242] “. . . . .

And this indeed is her body; but do thou, lifting on high the understanding of thy intelligence, hear from the mouth of Truth, the self-producing Word, which also conveys the Father. “And when she had said this, the Truth (he says) looked upon him, and opened her mouth and spake a Word: and the Word became a Name, and the Name was what we know and speak, Christ Jesus; and immediately she had uttered the Name, she became silent. And when Marcus thought that she would speak further, the Quaternion came forward again and said: ‘Thou didst hold as contemptible the Word which thou hast heard from the mouth of Truth, but this is not the Name which thou knowest and thinkest thou has possessed for long; for thou has only its sound, as to its virtue, thou art ignorant — —————— * Adversus H aereses , Book I, ch. xiv, § 3 and 4; also found in Epiphanius, Panarion , xxiv, § 4. ——————— 7 8  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS thereof.

The absurdities of the Chiliasts, Millenniumists and Millenarians are a striking proof of the materialism of Patristic theology, which has been re-edited and kept up to date down to this very day. This thousand physical years absurdity in various aspects, mostly with the physical return and reign of Christ on earth, was supported by the greatest lights of the Church. We find among its supporters such names as Papias, the co-disciple of Polycarp and a hearer of John, Irenaeus, Justin Martyr (who imagined that the thousand years would be spent in Jerusalem “rebuilt, adorned, and enlarged”), Tertullian,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Victorinus, Apollinarius, Lactantius, Severus and Augustine.

Me tangismos was the technical term for metempsychosis or reincarnation among the Pythagoreans. C. W. King, however, translates this passage: “nor transformed themselves into various figures ”; but somata are animal bodies and nothing else, and metangizein and metangismos are technical terms, used only in connection with the idea of reincarnation, and frequently employed in Pistis-Sophia by Schwartze to denote rebirth. It is, therefore, difficult to understand how the author of The Gnostics and their Remains missed the correct translation. Augustine [Aurelius, St. (354 A.D .-429 A.D .)] copying from Philaster, gives the name of Me tangismonitae to a certain sect of the Heretics who, he avers, asserted that the Son was in the Father, as one vessel ( angeion ) in another. There is, however, no evidence to support this statement. The many striking and instructive passages referring to reincarnation from the writings and teachings of the Gnostic Heresiarchs have yet to be collected. As an example, we take one from Clemens Alexandrinus ( Strom ., lib. iv, chap. xii), who quoted from Basilides in order to refute him as he imagined. Basilides, he says averred that the soul was punished in this life for sins that it had previously committed in another. The elect soul was honourably punished through martyrdom, but the other was purified by its proper chastisement. The key of Theosophy at once unlocks the mystery by its teachings as to the Higher and Lower Manas, the divine Individuality and the perishable Personality. For the Higher Ego is indeed the Sacrificial Victim, that suffers an honourable “martyrdom”; and “the other” is the Lower Manas that must be punished by its “proper chastisement”. The late E. D. Walker, in the eighth chapter of his book on Reincarnation ,* has given a brief sketch to show that it was the prevailing creed in the first centuries of Christianity, and those who are interested in the subject should certainly read this chapter, if they have not done so already. An authoritative volume, however, has yet to be written on the subject, supported by the citation of the innumerable passages that are to be found in the writings of the Gnostics, Neo-platonists and early Church Fathers.† The doctrines of the Pistis-Sophia are in many essentials identical ——————— * [ R eincarnation ; A study of Forgotten Truth , N.Y., University Books, 1965 reprint.] † [Today’s students may consult S.

Moreover, such writers, if they were initiated, had their tongues tied by the oath of secrecy; and if uninitiated, could only re-echo the popular beliefs at best, and in general wove in their own glosses and misconceptions even of this distorted shadow of the truth. Consequently no subject remains in greater obscurity for our scholars. Wilkinson ( Ancient Egyptians , Vol. V., p. 440, 3rd ed.) throws no light on the subject, although he is useful for the finding of a few references. Let us turn to the first of them, Herodotus, Euterpe , ch. 123. “The Egyptians are the first who said that the psyche of man is immortal, and that when the body ( s ∩ ma ) is destroyed, it always enters into some other living one ( zóon ), and after having completed the cycle of all earthy, watery, and airy (bodies), it enters again into the body of a man, and this cycle takes it 3,000 years to accomplish.” Again, in Plato’s Phaedrus , translated by Thomas Taylor, p. 325, we read:— “But no soul will return to its pristine condition till the expiration of 10,000 years, since it will not recover the use of its wings until that period, except it be the soul of one who has philosophised sincerely , or, together with philosophy, has loved beautiful forms. These, indeed, in the third period of 1,000 years, if they have thrice chosen this mode of life in succession . . . shall in the 3,000th year fly away to their pristine abode; but other souls being arrived at the end of their first life shall be judged. And of those who are judged, some, proceeding to a subterraneous place of judgment [ Kamaloka ], shall there sustain the punishments they have deserved; but others, in consequence of a favourable judgment, being elevated into a certain celestial place [ Devachan ], shall pass their time in a manner becoming the life they have lived in a human shape. And in the 1,000th year, both the kinds of those who have been judged, returning to the lot and election of a second life, shall each of them receive a life agreeable to his desire. Here also the human soul shall pass into the life of a beast; and from that of a beast again into that of a man. For the soul that has never perceived the truth cannot pass into the human form.” These two passages throw considerable light on one another, and, with the help of Theosophical teachings, become understandable, in C OMMENTARY ON THE P ISTIS S OPHIA  81 spite of the innumerable blinds which they contain.

The former goes to “a certain celestial place”, and the latter to “a subterranean place”. It is the latter only that goes through the “cycle” which Herodotus speaks of. Wilkinson, therefore, is only useful for the two references, the first of which has been retranslated and the second retained verbatim, as it is Taylor’s translation. He, however, adds one further item of interest, viz: “The doctrine of transmigration was also admitted by the Pharisees; their belief according to Josephus,* being ‘that all souls were incorruptible; but that those of good men were only removed into other bodies, and that those of the bad were subject to eternal punishment’.” — —————— * Joseph.

It is new to most, firstly, because it belongs to a distinct group of occult aphorisms in partibus infidelium , and our present-day Rabbis and Pharisees will accept nothing coming from that Nazareth; secondly, because those who will swallow a camel of whatever size, provided it hails from orthodox or accepted authorities, will strain and kick at the smallest gnat, if only its buzz comes from theosophical regions . Yet this proposition about the world cycles and ever-recurring events, is a very correct one . It is one, moreover, that people could easily verify for themselves . Of course, the people meant here are men who do their own thinking; not those others who are satisfied to remain, from birth till death, pinned, like a thistle fastened to the coat-tail of a country parson, to the beliefs and thoughts of the goody-goody majority . We cannot agree with a writer (was it Gilpin?) who said that the grandest truths are often rejected, “not so much for want of direct evidence, as for want of inclination to search for it . ” This applies but to a few .

In sober truth, our opponents — advocates of official science, defenders of orthodox religion, and the tutti quanti of the detractors of Theosophy—who claim to oppose our works on grounds of scientific “evidence,” “public good and truth,” strongly resemble advocates in our courts of law — miscalled of justice . These in their defence of robbers and murderers, forgers and adulterers, deem it to be their duty to browbeat, confuse and bespatter all who bear witness against their clients, and will ignore, or if possible, suppress, all evidence which goes to incriminate them . Let ancient Wisdom step into the witness-box herself, and prove that the goods found in the possession of the prisoner at the bar, were taken from her own strong-box; and she will find herself accused of all manner of crimes, fortunate if she escape being branded as a common fraud, and told that she is no better than she should be . What member of our Society can wonder then, that in this our age, pre-eminently one of shams and shows, the “theosophists’” teachings so (mis-) called, seem to be the most unpopular of all the systems now to the fore; or that materialism and theology, science and modern philosophy, have arrayed themselves in holy alliance against theosophical studies—perhaps because all the former are based on chips and broken-up fragments of that primordial system . Cotton complains somewhere, that the “metaphysicians have been learning their lesson for the last four (?) thousand years,” and that “it is now high time that they should begin to teach something . ” But, no sooner is the possibility of such studies offered, with the complete evidence into the bargain that they belong to the oldest doctrine of the meta-physical philosophy of mankind, than, instead of giving T HE B ABEL OF M ODERN T HOUGHT   85 t hem a fair hearing at least, the majority of the complainers turn away with a sneer and the cool remark : “Oh, you must have invented all you say yourself!” Dear ladies and gentlemen, has it ever occurred to you, how truly grand and almost divine would be that man or woman, who, at this time of the life of mankind, could invent anything, or discover that which had not been invented and known ages before? The charge of being such an inventor would only entitle the accused to the choicest honours . For show us, if you can, that mortal who in the historical cycle of our human race has taught the world something entirely new . To the proud pretentions of this age, Occultism—the real Eastern Occultism, or the so-called Esoteric Doctrine—answers through its ablest students : Indeed all your boasted knowledge is but the reflex action of the by-gone Past . At best, you are but the modern popularisers of very ancient ideas . Consciously and unconsciously you have pilfered from old classics and philosophers, who were themselves but the superficial recorders—cautious and incomplete, owing to the terrible penalties for divulging the secrets of initiation taught during the mysteries—of the primæval Wisdom . Avant! your modern sciences and speculations are but the réchauffé dishes of antiquity; the dead bones (served with a sauce piquante of crass materialism, to disguise them) of the intellectual repasts of the gods .

It is not Eastern literature only, and the whole cycle of those esoteric teachings which an over-zealous Christian Kabalist, in France, has just dubbed “the accursed sciences”—that will give you a flat denial, but profane classical literature, as well . The proof is easy . Are not physics and natural sciences but an amplified reproduction of the works of Anaxagoras, of Empedocles, Democritus and others? All that is taught now , was taught by these philosophers then . For they maintained—even in the fragments of their works still extant—that the Universe is composed of eternal atoms which, moved by a subtle internal Fire, combine in millions of various ways . With them, this “Fire” was the divine Breath of the Universal Mind, but now, it has become with the modern philosophers no better than a blind and senseless Force . Furthermore they taught that there was neither Life nor Death, but only a constant destruction of form , produced by perpetual physical transformations . This has now become by intellectual transformation, that which is known as the physical correlation of forces, conservation of energy, law of continuity, and what not, in the vocabulary of modern Science . But “what’s in a name,” or in new-fangled words and compound terms, once that the identity of the essential ideas is established? Was not Descartes indebted for his original theories to the old Masters, to Leucippus and Democritus, Lucretius Anaxagoras and Epicurus? These taught that the celestial bodies were formed of a multitude of atoms, whose vortical motion existed from eternity; which met, and, rotating together, the heaviest were drawn to the centres, the lightest to the circumferences; each of these concretions was carried away in a fluidic matter, which, receiving from this rotation an impulse, the stronger communicated it to the weaker concretions . This seems a tolerably close description of the Cartesian theory of Elemental Vortices taken from Anaxagoras and some others; and it does look most suspiciously like the “vortical atoms” of Sir W . Thomson!"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"T HE B ABEL OF M ODERN T HOUGHT  87 Ev en Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest among the great, is found constantly mirroring a dozen or so of old philosophers . In reading his works one sees floating in the air the pale images of the same Anaxagoras and Democritus, of Pythagoras, Aristotle, Timæus of Locri, Lucretius, Macrobius, and even our old friend Plutarch . All these have maintained one or the other of these propositions, (1) that the smallest of the particles of matter would be sufficient—owing to its infinite divisibility—to fill infinite space; (2) that there exist two Forces emanated from the Universal Soul, combined in numerical proportions (the centripetal and centrifugal “forces,” of the latter day scientific saints); (3) that there was a mutual attraction of bodies, which attraction causes the latter to, what we now call, gravitate and keeps them within their respective spheres; (4) they hinted most unmistakably at the relation existing between the weight and the density, or the quantity of matter contained in a unit of mass; and (5) taught that the attraction (gravitation) of the planets toward the Sun is in reciprocal proportion to their distance from that luminary . Finally, is it not a historical fact that the rotation of the Earth and the heliocentric system were taught by Pythagoras—not to speak of Hiketas, Heraclitus, Ekphantos, etc . —over 2,000 years before the despairing and now famous cry of Galileo, “ Eppur si muove ”? Did not the priests of Eturia and the Indian Rishis still earlier, know how to attract lightning, ages upon ages before even the astral Sir B . Franklin was formed in space? Euclid is honoured to this day—perhaps, because one cannot juggle as easily with mathematics and figures, as with symbols and words bearing on unprovable hypotheses . Archimedes has probably forgotten more in his day, than our modern mathematicians, astronomers, geometricians, mechanicians, hydrostaticians and opticians ever knew . Without Archytas, the disciple of Pythagoras, the application of the theory of mathematics to practical purposes would, perchance, remain still unknown to our grand era of inventions and machinery . Needless to remind the reader of that which the Aryans knew, 88   B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS as it is already recorded in The Theosophist and other works obtainable in India . W ise was Solomon in saying that “there is no new thing under the Sun”; and that everything that is “hath been already of old time, which was before us” [ Eccl . i, 9-10]—save, perhaps, the theosophical doctrines which the humble writer of the present is charged by some with having “invented . ” The prime origin of this (very complimentary) accusation is due to the kind efforts of the S . P . R . It is the more considerate and kind of this “world famous, and learned Society” of “Researches,” as its scribes seem utterly incapable of inventing anything original themselves—even in the way of manufacturing a commonplace illustration . If the inquisitive reader turns to the article which follows, he will have the satisfaction of finding a curious proof of this fact, in a reprint from old Izaak Walton’s Lives ,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"which our contributor has entitled “Mrs . Donne’s Astral Body . ” Thus even the scientifically accurate Cambridge Dons are not, it seems, above borrowing from an ancient book; and not only fail to acknowledge the debt, but even go to the trouble of presenting it to the public as new original matter , without even the compliment of inverted commas . And thus—all along . In short, it may be said of the scientific theories, that those which are true are not new; and those which are new—are not true, or are at least, very dubious . It is easy to hide behind “merely working hypotheses,” but less easy to maintain their plausibility in the face of logic and philosophy . To make short work of a very big subject, we have but to institute a brief comparison between the old and the new teachings . That which modern science would make us believe, is this : the atoms possess innate and immutable properties . That which Esoteric, and also exoteric, Eastern philosophy calls divine Spirit-Substance ( Purusha-Prakriti ) or eternal Spirit-matter, one inseparable from the other, modern Science calls Force and Matter, adding as we do (for it is a Vedantic conception), that, the two being inseparable, matter is but an abstraction (an illusion rather) . The properties of matter are, by the Eastern Occultists, T HE B ABEL OF M ODERN T HOUGHT  89 s ummed up in, or brought down to, attraction and repulsion; by the Scientists, to gravitation and affinities . According to this teaching, the properties of complex combinations are but the necessary results of the composition of elementary properties; the most complex existences being the physico-chemical automata, called men . Matter from being primarily scattered and inanimate, begets life, sensation, emotions and will, after a whole series of consecutive “gropings . ” The latter non-felicitous expression (belonging to Mr . Tyndall), forced the philosophical writer, Delboeuf* to criticize the English Scientist in very disrespectful terms, and forces us in our turn, to agree with the former . Matter, or anything equally conditioned, once that it is declared to be subject to immutable laws, cannot “grope . ” But this is a trifle when compared with dead or inanimate matter, producing life , and even psychic phenomena of the highest mentality! Finally, a rigid determinism reigns over all nature . All that which has once happened to our automatical Universe, had to happen, as the future of that Universe is traced in the smallest of its particles or “atoms . ” Return these atoms, they say, to the same position and order they were in at the first moment of the evolution of the physical Kosmos, and the same universal phenomena will be repeated in precisely the same order, and the Universe will once more return to its present conditions . To this, logic and philosophy answer that it cannot be so, as the properties of the particles vary and are changeable . If the atoms are eternal and matter indestructible, these atoms can never have been born; hence, they can have nothing innate in them . Theirs is the one homogeneous (and we add divine ) substance, while compound molecules receive their properties, at the beginning of the life cycles or manvantaras , from within without . Organisms cannot have been developed from dead or inanimate matter, as, firstly, such matter does not exist, and secondly, philosophy proving it conclusively, the Universe is not “subjected to fatality . ” As Occult ———————"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"* In the Revue Philosophique of 1883, where he translates such “gropings” by atonnements successifs . ——————— 90   B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Science teaches that the universal process of differentiation begins anew after every period of Maha-pralaya , there is no reason to think that it would slavishly and blindly repeat itself . Immutable laws last only from the incipient to the last stage of the universal life, being simply the effects of primordial, intelligent and entirely free action . For Theosophists, as also for Dr . Pirogoff, Delboeuf and many a great independent modern thinker, it is the Universal (and to us impersonal because infinite ) Mind, which is the true and primordial Demiurge . What better illustrates the theory of cycles, than the following fact? Nearly 700 years B . C . , in the schools of Thales and Pythagoras, was taught the doctrine of the true motion of the earth, its form and the whole heliocentric system . And in 317 A . D . Lactantius, the pr eceptor of Crispus Cæsar, the son of the Emperor Constantine, is found teaching his pupil that the earth was a plane surrounded by the sky, itself composed of fire and water! Moreover, the venerable Church Father warned his pupil against the heretical doctrine of the earth ’ s globular form , as the Cambridge and Oxford “Father Dons” warn their students now, against the pernicious and superstitious doctrines of Theosophy—such as Universal Mind, Re-incarnation and so on . There is a resolution tacitly accepted by the members of the T . S . for the adoption of a proverb of King Solomon, paraphrased for our daily use : “A scientist is wiser in his own conceit than seven Theosophists that can render a reason . ” No time, therefore, should be lost in arguing with them; but no endeavour, on the other hand, should be neglected to show up their mistakes and blunders . The scientific conceit of the Orientalists—especially of the youngest branch of these—the Assyriologists and the Egyptologists—is indeed phenomenal . Hitherto, some credit was given to the ancients—to their philosophers and Initiates , at any rate—of knowing a few things that the moderns could not rediscover . But now even the greatest Initiates are represented to the public as fools . Here is an instance . On pages 15, 16 and 17 ( Introduction ) in the Hibbert Lectures of 1887 by Prof .

Complaining of the difficulties and obstacles that meet the Assyriologist at every step of his studies; after giving “the dreary catalogue” of the formidable struggles of the interpreter to make sense of the inscriptions from broken fragments of clay tiles; the Professor goes on to confess that the scholar who has to read these cuneiform characters, is often likely “to put a false construction upon isolated passages, the context of which must be supplied from conjecture” (p . 14) . Notwithstanding all this, the learned lecturer places the modern Assyriologist higher than the ancient Babylonian Initiate , in the knowledge of symbols and his own religion! The passage deserves to be quoted in toto : It is true that many of the sacred texts were so written as to be intelligible only to the initiated; but the initiated were provided with keys and glosses, many of which are in our hands (?) . . . We can penetrate into the real meaning of documents which to him (the ordinary Babylonian) were a sealed book . Nay, more than this, the researches that have been made during the last half-century into the creed and beliefs of the nations of the world both past and present, have given us a clue to the interpretation of these documents which even the initiated priests did not possess . Th e above (the italics being our own) may be better appreciated when thrown into a syllogistic form .

These have to substitute for the high spiritual and quasi absolute truth the relative one, which having two sides or aspects, both conditioned by appearances, lead our “brain-minds”—one to intellectual scientific materialism, the other to materialistic or anthropomorphic religiosity . But even that kind of truth, in order to offer a coherent and complete system of something, has, while naturally clashing with its opposite, to offer no gaps and contradictions, no broken or missing links, in the special system or doctrine it undertakes to represent .

It has never been contemplated to make of the sacred truths an integral system for the ribaldry and sneers of a profane and iconoclastic public . The work does not pretend to set up a series of explanations, complete in all their details, of the mysteries of Being; nor does it seek to win for itself the name of a distinct system of thought—like the works of Messrs . Herbert Spencer, Schopenhauer or Comte . On the contrary, The Secret Doctrine merely asserts that a system, known as the W ISDOM -R ELIGION , the work of generations of adepts and seers, the sacred 9 4   B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS h eirloom of pre-historic times—actually exists, though hitherto preserved in the greatest secrecy by the present Initiates; and it points to various corroborations of its existence to this very day, to be found in ancient and modern works . Giving a few fragments only, it there shows how these explain the religious dogmas of the present day, and how they might serve Western religions, philosophies and science, as sign-posts along the untrodden paths of discovery . The work is essentially fragmentary, giving statements of sundry facts taught in the esoteric schools—kept, so far, secret—by which the ancient symbolism of various nations is interpreted . It does not even give the keys to it, but merely opens a few of the hitherto secret drawers . No new philosophy is set up in The Secret Doctrine , only the hidden meaning of some of the religious allegories of antiquity is given, light being thrown on these by the esoteric sciences, and the common source is pointed out, whence all the world-religions and philosophies have sprung . Its chief attempt is to show, that however divergent the respective doctrines and systems of old may seem on their external or objective side, the agreement between all becomes perfect, so soon as the esoteric or inner side of these beliefs and their symbology are examined and a careful comparison made . It is also maintained that its doctrines and sciences, which form an integral cycle of universal cosmic facts and metaphysical axioms and truths, represent a complete and unbroken system; and that he who is brave and persevering enough, ready to crush the animal in himself, and forgetting the human self , sacrifices it to his Higher Ego, can always find his way to become initiated into these mysteries . This is all The Secret Doctrine claims . Are not a few facts and self-evident truths, found in these volumes—all the literary defects of the exposition notwithstanding—truths already proved practically to some , better than the most ingenious “working” hypotheses, liable to be upset any day, than the unexplainable mysteries of religious dogmas, or the most seemingly profound philosophical speculations?

No “philosopher” who views the spiritual realm as a mere figment of superstition, and regards man’s mental perceptions as simply the result of the organization of the brain, can ever be worthy of that name . Nor has a materialist any right to the appellation, since it means a “lover of Wisdom,” and Pythagoras, who was the first to coin the compound term, never limited Wisdom to this earth . One who affirms that the Universe and Man are objects of the senses only, and who fatally chains thought within the region of senseless matter, as do the Darwinian evolutionists, is at best a sophiaphobe when not a philosophaster—never a philosopher . Therefore is it that in this age of Materialism, Agnosticism, Evolutionism, and false Idealism, there is not a system, however intellectually expounded, that can stand on its own legs, or fail to be criticized by an exponent from another school of thought as materialistic as itself; even Mr . Herbert Spencer, the greatest of all, is unable to answer some criticisms . Many are those who remember the fierce polemics that raged a few years ago in the English and American journals between the Evolutionists on the one hand and the Positivists on the other . The subject of the dispute was with regard to the attitude and relation that the theory of evolution would bear to religion . Mr . F . Harrison, the Apostle of Positivism, charged Mr . Herbert Spencer with restricting religion to the realm of reason, forgetting that feeling and not the cognizing faculty, played the most important part in it . The “erroneousness and insufficiency” of the ideas on the “Unknowable”—as developed in Mr . Spencer’s works—were also taken to task by Mr . Harrison . The idea was erroneous , he held, because it was based on the acceptation of the metaphysical absolute . It was insufficient, he argued, because it brought deity down to an 96   B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS e mpty abstraction, void of any meaning . * To this the great English writer replied, that he had never thought of offering his “Unknowable” and Incognizable, as a subject for religious worship . Then stepped into the arena, the respective admirers and defenders of Messrs . Spencer and Harrison, some defending the material metaphysics of the former thinker (if we may be permitted to use this paradoxical yet correct definition of Mr . Herbert Spencer’s philosophy), others, the arguments of the Godless and Christless Roman Catholicism of Auguste Comte,† both sides giving and receiving very hard blows . Thus, Count Goblet d’Alviella of Brussels‡ suddenly discovered in Mr . H . Spencer a kind of hidden, yet reverential Theist, and compared Mr . Harrison to a casuist of mediaeval Scholasticism . It is not to discuss the relative merits of materialistic Evolutionism, or of Positivism either, that the two English thinkers are brought forward; but simply to point, as an illustration, to the Bable-like confusion of modern thought . While the Evolutionists (of"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Herbert Spencer’s school) maintain that the historical evolution of the religious feeling consists in the constant abstraction of the attributes of Deity, and their final separation from the primitive concrete conceptions—this process rejoicing in the easy-going triple compound of deanthropomorphization , or the disappearance of human attributes—the Comtists on their side hold to another version .

The only way, therefore, of settling the dispute, is to ascertain which of the two “philosophical” and “scientific” theories, is the less pernicious and the more probable . Is it true to say, as d’Alviella* assures us, that Mr . Spencer’s “Unknowable” contains all the elements necessary to religion; and, as that remarkable writer is alleged to imply, that “religious feeling tends to free itself from every moral element”; or, shall we accept the other extremity and agree with the Comtists, that gradually, religion will blend itself with, merge into, and disappear in altruism and its service to Humanity? Useless to say that Theosophy, while rejecting the one-sidedness and therefore the limitation in both ideas, is alone able to reconcile the two, i . e . , the Evolutionists and the Positivists—on both metaphysical and practical lines. How to do this it is not here the place to say, as every Theosophist acquainted with the main tenets of the Esoteric Philosophy can do it for himself. We believe in an impersonal “Unknowable” and know well that the A BSOLUTE , or Absoluteness, can have nought to do with worship on anthropomorphic lines; Th e osophy rejects the Spencerian “He” and substitutes the impersonal IT for the personal pr onoun, whenever speaking of the Absolute and the “Unknowable . ” And it teaches, as foremost of all virtues, altruism and self-sacrifice, brotherhood and compassion for every living creature, without, for all that, worshipping Man or Humanity. In the Positivist, moreover, who admits of no immortal soul in men, believes in no future life or reincarnation, such a “worship” becomes worse than fetishism : it is Zoolatry , the worship of the animals For that alone which constitutes the real Man is, in the words of Carlyle, “the essence of our being, the mystery in us that calls itself ‘I’— . . . . a breath of Heaven; the Highest Being reveals himself in man.” This denied, man is but an animal—“the shame and scandal of the Universe”, as Pascal puts it. ——————— * [ Ibid . pp . 129-152 . ] ——————— 98  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS It is the old, old story, the struggle of matter and spirit, the “survival of the unfittest ,” be cause of the strongest and the most material .

In the beginning of time, or rather, in the childhood of the fifth Race, “the whole earth was of one lip and of one speech,” saith chapter xi of Genesis . Read esoterically, this means that mankind had one universal doctrine, a philosophy, common to all; and that men were bound by one religion, whether this term be derived from the Latin word relegere , “to gather, or be united” in speech or in thought, from religens , revering the gods,” or, from religare , “to be bound fast together . ” Take it one way or the other, it means most undeniably and plainly that our forefathers from beyond the “flood” accepted in common one truth—i . e . , they believed in that aggregate of subjective and objective facts which form the consistent, logical and harmonious whole called by us the Wisdom-Religion . Now, reading the first nine verses of chapter xi between the lines, we get the following information . Wise in their generation, our early fathers were evidently acquainted with the imperishable truism which teaches that in union alone lies strength— in union of thought as well as in that of nations, of course . Therefore, lest in disunion they should be “scattered upon the face of the earth,” and their Wisdom- T HE B ABEL OF M ODERN T HOUGHT  99 r eligion should, in consequence, be broken up into a thousand fragments; and lest they, themselves, instead of towering as hitherto, through knowledge , heavenward, should, through blind faith begin gravitating earthward—the wise men, who “journeyed from the East,” devised a plan . In those days temples were sites of learning, not of superstition; priests taught divine Wisdom, not man-invented dogmas, and the ultima thule of their religious activity did not centre in the contribution box, as at present . Thus—“‘Go to,’ they said, ‘let us build us a city and a tower , whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name . ’ And they made burnt brick and used it for stone , and built therewith a city and a tower . ” So far, this is a very old story, known as well to a Sunday school ragamuffin as to Mr . Gladstone . Both believe very sincerely that these descendants of the “accursed Ham” were proud sinners whose object was like that of the Titans, to insult and dethrone Zeus-Jehovah, by reaching “heaven,” the supposed abode of both . But since we find the story told in the revealed * Scripts, it must, like all the rest in them, have its esoteric interpretation . In this, Occult symbolism will help us . All the expressions that we have"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"——————— * A curious and rather unfortunate word to use, since, as a translation from the Latin r evelare , it signifies diametrically the opposite of the now accepted meaning in English . For the word “to reveal” or “revealed” is derived from the Latin revelare , “to reveil” and not to reveal i . e . , from re “again” or “back” and velare “to veil” or to hide something, from the word velum or “a vail” (or veil), a cover . Thus, instead of unvailing , or revealing . Moses has truly only “reveiled” once more the Egypto-Chaldean theological legends and allegories, into which, as one “learned in all the Wisdom of Egypt” he had been initiated . Yet Moses was not the first revealer or reveiler , as Ragon well observes . Thousands of years before him Hermes was credited with veiling over the Indian mysteries to adapt them for the land of the Pharaohs . Of course, at present there is no longer classical authority to satisfy the orthodox philologist, but the occult authority which maintains that originally the word revelare meant to “veil once more,” and hence that revelation means the throwing a veil over a subject, a blind —is positively overwhelming . ——————— 1 00  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS i talicized, when read in the original Hebrew and according to the canons of esoteric symbolism, will yield quite a different construction . Thus : 1 . “And the whole earth [mankind], was of one lip [ i . e . , proclaimed the same teachings] and of the same words ” — not of “speech” as in the authorized version . Now the Kabalistic meaning of the term “words” and “word” may be found in the Zohar and also in the Talmud . “Words” ( Dabarim ) mean “powers,” and word , in the singular, is a synonym of Wisdom; e . g . , “By the uttering of ten words was the world created”—( Talmud , “Pirkey Aboth,” c . 5, Mish . 1) . Here the “words” refer to the ten Sephiroth, Builders of the Universe . Again : “By the Word (Wisdom, Logos) of YHVH were the Heavens made . ” ( ibid . ) . 3-4 . “And the man* [the chief leader] said to his neighbour, ‘Go to, let us make bricks [disciples] and burn them to a burning [initiate, fill them with sacred fire], let us build us a city [establish mysteries and teach the Doctrine]† and a tower [ Ziggurrat , a sacred temple tower] whose top may reach unto heaven’” (the highest limit reachable in space) . The great tower of Nebo, of Nabi on the temple of Bel, was called “the house of the seven spheres of heaven and earth ,” and “the house of the stronghold (or strength, tagimut ) and the foundation stone of heaven and earth . ” Occult symbology teaches, that to burn bricks for a city means to train disciples for magic, a “hewn stone ” signifying a full Initiate, Petra the Greek and Kephas the Aramaic word for stone, having the same meaning, viz . , “interpreter of the Mysteries,” a Hierophant . The supreme initiation was referred to as “the burning with great burning . ” Thus, “the bricks are fallen down, but we will build ——————— * This is translated from the Hebrew original .

For the true interpretation of the four last verses of the genetic allegory about the supposed “confusion of tongues ” we may turn to the legendary version of the Yezidis and read verses 5, 6, 7, and 8 in Genesis , ch . xi, esoterically : — “And Adonai [the Lord] came down and said : ‘Behold, the people is one [the people are united in thought and deed] and they have one lip [doctrine] . ’ And now they begin to spread it and ‘nothing will be restrained from them [they will have full magic powers and get all they want by such power, Kriyasakti], that they have imagined . ’” And now what are the Yezidis and their version and what is Ad-onai? Ad is “the Lord,” their ancestral god; and the Yezidis are a heretical Mussulman sect, scattered over Armenia, Syria, and especially Mosul, the very site of Babel (see Chaldean Account of Genesis ), who are known under the strange name of “Devil-worshippers . ” Their confession of faith is very original . They recognize two powers or gods—Allah and Ad (or Ad-onai), but identify the latter with Sheitan or Satan . This is but natural since Satan is also “a son of god”* (see Job , i, 6) . As stated in the Hibbert Lectures (pp . 346 and 347), Satan the “Adversary,” was the minister and angel of God . Hence, when questioned on the cause of their curious worship of one who has become the embodiment of Evil and the dark spirit of the Earth, they ——————— * It is commanded in E cclesiasticus xxi, 30, not to curse Satan, “lest one should forfeit his own life . ” Why? Because in their permutations “the Lord God,” Moses, and Satan are one . The name the Jews gave while in Babylon to their exoteric God , the substitute for the true Deity of which they never spoke or wrote, was the Assyrian Mosheh or Adar , the god of the scorching sun (the “Lord thy God is a consuming flame ” verily!) and therefore, Mosheh or Moses, shone also . In Egypt, Typhon (Satan) the red , was identified both with the red Ass or Typhon called Set or Seth (and worshipped by the Hittites) and the same as El (the Sun god of the Assyrians and the Semites, or Jehovah), and with Moses, the red, also . (See Isis Unveiled , Vol . II, pp . 523-24 . ) For Moses was red-skinned . According to the Zohar (Vol .

They tell you that Allah, being All-good , would not harm the smallest of his creatures . Ergo , has he no need of prayers, or burnt-offerings of the “firstlings of the flock and the fat thereof . ” But that their Ad, or the Devil, being All-bad , cruel, jealous, revengeful and proud, they have, in self-preservation, to propitiate him with sacrifices and burnt offerings smelling sweet in his nostrils, and to coax and flatter him .

The jealous genius of the earth became envious of the powers and sanctity of men (as the god Vishnu becomes jealous of the great powers of the Yogis , even when they were Daityas); and therefore this deity of matter and concupiscence confused their brains, tempted and made the “Builders” fall into his nets; and thus, having lost their purity, they lost therewith their knowledge and magic powers, intermarried and became “scattered upon the face of the earth . ” This is more logical than to attribute to one’s “God,” the All-good , such ungodly tricks as are fathered upon him in the Bible . Moreover, the legend about the tower of Babel and the confusion of speech , is like much else, not original, ——————— the saying “the face of Moses was like the face of the Sun” (see Q abbalah by Isaac Myer, p . 93 . ) These three were the three aspects of the manifested God (the substitute for Ain Soph , the infinite Deity) or Nature, in its three chief Kingdoms—the Fiery or Solar, the Human or Watery, the Animal or Earthy . There never was a Mosheh or Moses before the Captivity and Ezra, the deep Kabalist; and what is now Moses had another name 2,000 years before . Where are the Hebrew scrolls before that time? Moreover, we find a corroboration of this in Dr . Sayce’s Hibbert Lectures (1887) . Adar is the Assyrian “War God” or the Lord of Hosts and the same as Moloch . The Assyrian equivalent of Mosheh (Moses) is Mâsu , the “double” or the “twin,” and Mâsu is the title of Adar, meaning also a “hero . ” No one who reads carefully the said Lectures from page 40 to 58 can fail to see that Jehovah, Mâsu and Adar, with several others—are permutations . ——————— T HE B ABEL OF M ODERN T HOUGHT  103 b ut comes from the Chaldeans and Babylonians . George Smith found the version on a mutilated fragment of the Assyrian tablets, though there is nothing said in it about the confusion of speech . “I have translated the word ‘speech’ with a prejudice,” he says ( Chaldean Account of Genesis , p . 163), “I have never seen the Assyrian word with this meaning . ” Anyone who reads for himself the fragmentary translation by G . Smith, on pages 160-163 in the volume cited, will find the version much nearer to that of the Yezidis than to the version of Genesis . It is he, whose “heart was evil” and who was “wicked,” who confused “their counsel,” not their “speech,” and who broke “the Sanctuary . . . which carried Wisdom,” and “bitterly they wept at Babel . ” And so ought to “weep” all the philosophers and lovers of ancient Wisdom; for it is since then that the thousand and one exoteric substitutes for the one true Doctrine or lip had their beginning, obscuring more and more the intellects of men, and shedding innocent blood in fierce fanaticism . Had our modern philosophers studied, instead of sneering at, the old Books of Wisdom—say the Kabala— they would have found that which would have unveiled to them many a secret of ancient Church and State . As they have not, however, the result is evident . The dark cycle of Kali Yuga has brought back a Babel of modern thought , compared with which the “confusion of tongues” itself appears a harmony .

The article in question is entitled “Christianity and Buddhism”, and while we can congratulate neither religion on its treatment by the Professor, we sincerely sympathise with the former in that the championship of the well-known Orientalist has left her in so sorry a predicament . We shall perhaps at some later date have a few words to say on this subject, pointing out the utter ignorance of even elementary symbology displayed in the paper . At present, however, we have only to notice the first paragraph, and enter a slight protest in the name of the native pandits in general and of the Sanskrit and Pali scholars of the T . S . in particular, who are by the way sufficiently numerous in India and Ceylon . The paragraph runs as follows : — Who has not suffered lately from Theosophy and Esoteric Buddhism?

It is nearly as bad as the Anglo-Jewish craze and the Original Home of the Aryans .

Another eminent Orientalist also accepted the hospitality of Lucifer ’ s pages lately, and Professor Max Müller must now pay the penalty of refusing to listen to Harpocrates, and of taking his finger from his lips ."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" From this introductory paragraph, we learn the interesting fact that the Professor’s calm i s being somewhat disturbed and that in order to overawe a questioning public, he is endeavouring to hide himself in the cloak of scholarship, with its ever-changing hues, and to step onto the lofty pedestal of patronising Western Orientalism . Now the English-speaking public is notorious for its love of fair-play, and is gradually w aking up to the fact that it is systematically and studiously kept in ignorance of many things, which prevent it forming a just judgment, and thus is proportionately growing righteously indignant . We, therefore, consider it our duty to let the public see both sides of the picture, by giving further publicity to a criticism of our critic . This we do both on general principles, following that ideal of Justice which is the cardinal tenet of Theosophy; and also in particular, because one of the Objects of the Theosophical Society is to get learned native gentlemen to instruct the West on the Eastern systems of religion, philosophy and science, and so remove the misconceptions that Western scholars have, consciously or unconsciously, instilled into the minds of their less instructed fellow-countrymen . This criticism, on a Sanskrit poem written by the Professor, is reprinted by permission from the Sanskrit Critical Journal , and is instructive not only for the reasons given above, but also because of the information which it contains on the Vedas and the manner in which the Hindus view these hoary relics of the past . 106  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS The translation of the poem and criticism runs as follows : T HE POEM 1.

Then indeed we long for him here at this congress, the lovely one, a joy to look at meant to be eaten by m en and women . THE CRITICISM T HE M ATSYA S UKTA (1) The Matsya Sukta is a poem of six stanzas by Professor Max Müller in praise of a fish called Salmon, o r in Germany Laksha . After going through the above, it struck our mind at the first sight that our learned professor has made it a parody of a Vaidic Sukta, for the purpose of pleasing his friends . If your supposition be correct, we congratulate the professor on his success, but regret at the same time that the Vedas, the most sacred works of the Hindus, upon which the Hindu religion is chiefly and originally based, have been ridiculed in such a childish manner by a great and good man like Professor Max Müller, who is generally regarded as a great admirer of the Vedas, and A C RITICISM ON A C RITIC   107 a chief defender of Hinduism : for a parody or mockery like this might lower the Vedas in the estimation of the Hindus, who have held the highest respect from times immemorial . (2) The Hindus consider the Vedas as ever existing with the Almighty himself, and as not composed by any being . The Hindu philosophers too, after long and earnest discussions, have established the same truth with regard to the Vedas . The ancient sages like Valmiki, Vasishta and Vyasa, etc . , who were Rishis in the true sense of the word, and probably much better acquainted with the Vedas than a Rishi of this iron age, used a new style of language called Laukika or the language of men, quite different from that of the Vedas, for the purpose of keeping the purity of the Vedas unalloyed . By doing this they have strictly prohibited common men from corrupting the Vedas by interpolation of such parodies or joking poems of their own . It is evident that a parody like this lowers the Vedas, the original spring of the Hindu religion—an unbearable thing for a Hindu . (3) On the other hand if the professor has seriously intended by this to show how vast is his command of the Vaidic language, and how deserving he is of the title (Rishi) which he has assumed, then the whole thing is quite absurd as well as highly inappropriate, and his whole attempt in this is an entire failure . (4) For instance, we first take the name of the poem, Matsya Sukta . The word Sukta is a purely Vaidic technical term, meaning a collection of Mantras, generally used in addressing a particular deity, so that it is quite absurd to use this very word in the sense of a common poem, though it might be a collection of stanzas treating of the same subject . The stanzas written by Professor Max Müller cannot in any way be considered Vaidic Mantras, for as we have already said, according to the Hindu Sastras, the Vaidic Mantras are not creations of any existing being . Professor Max Müller is of course well acquainted with the fact, but still he calls his poem a Sukta . What greater absurdity can there be than this? (5) A Vaidic Sukta has, first a deity or the subject matter of which it treats; second, the metre in which it is written; third, the Rishi by whom it was first seen; and fourth, Viniyoga, or its use in a particular religious ceremony . Our professor following this, also heads his poem with his deity the fish Laksha, its metre Gayatri,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"and its Rishi the professor himself; but he forgets to mention the last and most important thing, the Viniyoga, which is without a doubt a great defect, for without knowledge of the Viniyoga a Sukta is thoroughly useless . 108  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS ( 6) In fact the deity, metre, and Rishi, &c . , belonging to a Sukta, are all Vaidic technicalities . The deity never means a subject matter treated of in a common poem, but only what has been treated of in a genuine Vaidic Sukta . Does the poem under review belong to an original Veda, Ric, Yajus or Saman? If not, then what right has its author to call its subject matter by a name of a deity? We shall be highly obliged if the author will kindly satisfy us with any authority . (7) Metres are of two kinds, Vaidic and Laukika . The Vaidic Metres are chiefly confined to the Vedas while the Laukikas are only for use in common poetry . So each of the Metres, Gayatri, &c . , has duplicate forms entirely differing from each other . The chief characteristic of the Vaidic form of a Metre is the accent mark of its words, i . e . , each word in it must be marked with its proper accent, for it is said in the Bhashya of Panini that a word without proper accentuation kills the utterer just like Indra Satru . It is evident from the above that a Vaidic Metre cannot be used in common poetry, and even in the Vedas every word in it must be marked with its proper accent marks . But we are sorry to see that Professor Max Müller, the great Vaidic scholar of the day, has violated this rule by using the Vaidic form of the Gayatri Metre in his own poem, and moreover has not marked his words with their proper accent marks . Wonderful inappropriateness, indeed! (8) Now regarding the Rishi, the Rishi of a Sukta means the first seer of a Sukta, or one to whom the Sukta was first revealed in its complete form . For according to the Hindu Sastras, though the Vedas are ever existing, they have occasionally disappeared at the time of Pralaya or deluge . And at the beginning of the new creation they were again partly revealed by the will of God to the internal eyes of some particular men who were called Rishis . There are a good many Rishis in the Vedas . It must however be understood here that in every creation the Vedas are revealed to the same men only . So no new Rishi can occupy a place in the Vedas . Now we may ask the favour of the professor’s supplying us with his authority for calling himself a Rishi, while already knowing that his poem can never be reckoned as an original part of the Vedas? (9) Moreover the poem indicates neither any extraordinary skill on the author’s part, nor any uncommon scholarship in Sanskrit learning; but on the other hand it shows his deficiency in modern Sanskrit grammar . The author has written not only in the Vaidic style, but has kept throughout the Vaidic grammatical construction of words, which is not only strictly prohibited to a modern poet, but is also considered as ā dhu or incorrect . So the words Purbhebhih, &c . , though they might be correct according to Vaidic grammar, cannot be used by a modern poet, for A C RITICISM ON A C RITIC   109 none but the Rishis had the privileges of using such forms of words . The Rishis, according to the Hindu Sastras, are of two kinds : 1st, those to whom the Mantras of the Vedas were originally revealed; 2nd, those who, being Brahman by caste, are remarkable for learning, asceticism, truthfulness and profound scholarship in the Vedas . As no Vaidic Mantra has even been revealed to the Professor, the poem under review is of course, not a Vaidic Mantra, neither is he a Brahman by caste . Thus it is evident that he has no right to use such forms of words in his composition . The famous poet Bhavabhuti, it is true, followed occasionally the Vaidic style in his writing, but be carefully kept to the modern grammatical construction throughout . So the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"modern poets are bound to observe always the rules of modern grammar, otherwise their writings cannot be considered s ā dhu or correct . (10) In conclusion we may point out that no extraordinary scholarship is to be found in the poem, for the poem consists of six stanzas or eight lines only, but even in these few lines, passages from the Rigveda are borrowed without the slightest alteration, as would appear from the passages quoted below from the poem as well as from the Rigveda, placed side by side for comparison . * (11) For a Sanskrit poet nothing is more discreditable than to borrow passages from another’s works . Besides such words as adbhuta purupriya , &c . , are repeated in Mantras of the same metre (Gayatri) in the Rigveda . see the Rics : sahasamputro adbhuta , so nobody feels the least difficulty in picking them up . Thus we see in the poem the author’s own words are very few and these too do not indicate any capital security in the author . In our opinion a poem like this is not a creditable performance, even if it comes from the pen of an ordinary Sanskrit scholar . (12) Lastly it struck us very much to see that the word Lakshmi is translated as goddess of happiness . Anyone having the least acquaintance with Sanskrit literature knows very well that Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth or fortune, and not of happiness . (13) After all the poem is full of inconsistencies and absurdities, which the readers will easily find out : for instance in the third stanza, the fish Laksha is said to be praised by modern poets, as well as by those of old times . Here Rishi is translated into a poet, which is absurd . Again in India neither the Rishis of modern nor of ancient times were acquainted even with the name of the fish . How then could it be praised by them? ——————— * For instance stanza three . [p . 106] the gem of the whole poem, is word for word the same as the verse cited from the Rigveda . —[E DS . ] ——————— 1 10  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS And now a query and a remark to conclude with : — Q uery : Supposing a prominent Hindu pandit had parodied one of the Psalms of David, and used it to describe a debauch; we wonder what the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and the other associations of the Church Militant would have said . Yet this is but a feeble comparison, for the rhythm of the Davidic hymns of initiation is irretrievably lost, thanks to Masoretic desecration, whereas the swara of the Vedas is still preserved . This is the particular desecration that the Hindus have to complain of in the professor’s poem; not to mention a hundred other things which can only be understood by the reverent mind of the student of esotericism . Remark : We are content to leave our scholarship in the reliable hands of native gentlemen, and we prefer Bhatta Pulli to Oxford .

VII, No . 41, January, 1891, pp . 436-437] The giants of old are a fiction—say the wise men of the modern West . Whenever the bones of an alleged gigantic race of men are found, and speedily made a pretext for the glorification of verse 4, chapter vi, in the revealed Book—there invariably comes a Cuvier to crush the flower of superstition in the bud, by showing that they are only the bones of some Dinotherium giganteum of the family of tapirs . The “Secret Doctrine” is a fairy tale and the races of giants that preceded our own, a figment of the imagination of the ancients, and now—of Theosophists . The latter are quite willing to admit that the occasional appearance of giants and giantesses from seven to nine feet in our modern day, is not a complete proof . These are not giants in the strict sense of the term, though the scientifically demonstrated tendency to revert to the original type , is there, still unimpaired . To become a complete demonstration of this, the skeleton frames of our modern Goliaths and the structure of their bones, ought to be proportionate in breadth and thickness to the length of the body and also the size of the head . As this is not the case, the abnormal length may be due as much to hypertrophic causes as to reversion . To all such problems one answer has been constantly given, “time will show” (See, The Secret Doctrine , Vol . II, p . 277 et seq . ) “If the skeletons of the prehistoric ages have failed so far (which is positively denied) to prove the claim 112  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS here advanced, it is but a question of time . ” And now it is believed the time has come and the first proof is very satisfactory . We quote from The Galignani Messenger of June 21 and 23, 1890, the news of the following find, from an article headed “Giants of Old”, which speaks for itself : — Giants figure so often in our legends and the most ancient histories of the world that it has been a serious"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"question whether a race of gigantic men has not existed at some remote period of time—for example, during the quaternary epochs of the large mammals, the mastodon, mammoth, and so on—and whether the type may not have survived into later times . Pigmies would have a better chance of continuing to subsist under the supremacy of the normal man . The giants, like the greater quadrupeds, would be exterminated . Our oldest human fossils, however, such as the Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon skulls, do not indicate an extraordinary stature . Very tall skeletons have, no doubt, been found in some dolmens and barrows, but they are supposed to belong to the bronze age race, which is still an element of the European population . M . G . de Lapouge has recently made a discovery which tends to re-open this question . At the prehistoric cemetery of Castelnau, near Montpellier, which dates from the eras of polished stone and bronze, he found last winter, among many crania, one of enormous size, which could only belong to a man very much over 2 metres (6 ft . 6 in . ) in height, and of a morphologic type common in the dolmens of Lozère . It was the skull of a healthy youth about 18 years of age . Moreover, in the earth of a tumulus of vast extent, containing cists of the bronze age, more or less injured by superposed sepulchres of the early iron age, he found some fragments of human bones of a most abnormal size . For instance, part of a tibia 0 . 16 metre in circumference, part of a femur 0 . 13 metre in girth, and the inferior part of a humerus twice the ordinary dimensions . Everything considered M . de Lapouge estimates that the height of this subject must have been about 3½ metres (11 ft . )—that is to say, a veritable giant, according to the popular notion . He must have lived during the quaternary period or the beginning of the present, but whether he was an instance of hypertrophy or one of an extinct race of giants, it is impossible as yet to say . Singularly enough, tradition fixes the valley of a giant very near the spot in the cavern of Castelnau where the bones have been taken from the tumulus . “ Hypertrophy”—extending over the “length, breadth, and thickness” of the body, crowned, moreover with a head, or cranium “of enormous size”—looks suspiciously like an G OING T O AND F RO   113 e mpty pretext to make an exploding theory hold out a little longer . It is well that science should be cautious, but even the forty “Immortals” in all the majesty of their academical slumbers, would be laughed at were they to attempt to make us believe that the abnormal size of the Russian child-giantess, the six-and-a-half footer, aged nine, was due to chronic dropsy! ————— The criminal use of hypnotic suggestion has come largely to the front in the Eyraud-Bompard trial at Paris . The evidence given by Professor Liégeois of the famous medical school at Paris, was particularly interesting .

P . B . ” [ L ucifer , Vol. VII, No. 42, February, 1891, pp. 451-455] [I gladly give room to the protest which follows. It is wise and timely, and may, perhaps, ward off worse th an “petty criticisms of H.P.B.” Needless to say that Mrs. Besant’s article would not have appeared had I seen it before publication. But I may point out to Mr. Patterson that much of his protest, however true, is not exactly aimed at what Mrs. Besant wrote. She did not say that the T. S. taught any particular doctrines, but merely expressed her own view that the position of one who belonged to the T. S. and ungenerously carped at the pioneer who founded it was illogical. This is clearly a matter of opinion, and Mr. Patterson puts the opposing view. One has but to read the new “Constitution and Rules of the Theosophical Society” for 1891 (in the Supplement of the January Theosophist ), to find in Article xiii, 2, that “no Fellow, Officer, or Council of the Theosophical Society, or of any Section or Branch thereof, shall promulgate or maintain any doctrine as being that advanced or advocated by the Society”; and whatever we do, we have to abide by the Rules of the T.S. Mrs. Besant would have done more wisely to have called her article “Comments on the E. S. of the Theosophical Society and H.P.B.,” she would then have been on the safe side; for a member of the E.S. who receives instructions emanating from the Masters of the Occult Philosophy, and doubts at the same time the genuineness of the source, or the honesty of the humble transmitter of the old esoteric doctrines— lies to his own soul , and is untrue to his pledge . He cannot be honest and remain in the E.S., in such a case. But then, the Esoteric Section, its qualification “of the T.S.” notwithstanding, does not represent the latter, and in future it will drop the additional words altogether. From the very beginning its second rule stated, that the “Esoteric Section has no official or corporate connection with the 116  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS E xoteric Society” (see Lucifer of October, 1888).* Henceforth it will be called “the Esoteric School of Theosophy,” simply. Meanwhile, I thank our brother, Mr. Patterson, for giving me this opportunity of expressing my feelings.—H.P.B.] In the December number of Lucifer in an article entitled “The Theosophical Society a nd H.P.B.” there are the following statements:— “The following article expresses the views of many members of the Theosophical Society who feel strongly that it is time that some protest should be made against the constant petty criticisms levelled at H.P.B.

Either she is a messenger from the Masters, or else she is a fraud. “(2). In either case the Theosophical Society would have no existence without her. “(3). If she is a fraud she is a woman of wonderful ability and learning, giving all the credit of these to some persons who do not exist. “(4). If H.P.B. is a true messenger, opposition to her is opposition to the Masters, she being their only channel to the Western World. “(5). If there are no Masters, the Theosophical Society is an absurdity, and there is no use in keeping it up. But if there are Masters, and H.P.B. is their messenger, and the Theosophical Society their foundation, the Theosophical Society and H.P.B. cannot be separated before the world. “If the members care at all for the future of the Society, if they wish to know that the twentieth century will see it standing high above the strife of parties, a beacon-light in the darkness for the guiding of men, if they believe in the Teacher who founded it for human service, let them now rouse themselves from slothful indifference, sternly silence all dissensions or petty follies in their ranks, and march shoulder to shoulder for the achievement of the heavy task laid upon their strength and courage. If Theosophy is worth"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"anything it is worth living for and worth dying for. If it is worth nothing, let it go at once and for all.” ————— On these last grounds let us stand. If it is worth anything it is worth living for and dying for; and worth working for and worth writing for, and worth taking some risks for; and at the risk of incurring misunderstanding, and at the risk of hurting the feelings of those whose feelings should 118  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS n ot be hurt, this article is written and some exception taken to that just quoted from. For it does seem as though its author, through her impetuous kindness and loyalty, had allowed her judgment to be partially influenced by her feelings. And although there are few Theosophists who will disagree with her in most of her issues, yet there seems to be a little grain of erroneous opinion in them from which a large and poisonous growth may spring. If this is so, it is only true brotherliness to point it out. It lies first in the statement that: “If there are no Masters the Theosophical Society is an absurdity and there is no use of keeping it up”. And again in another statement which says: “Once accept the philosophy you must accept her (H.P.B.).” May not much harm be done by the holding of such views? May they not tend to keep many out who would be benefited by being in; and for whom the Society was largely founded? Are not the statements in their nature somewhat dogmatic? Have we not still in our natures some of that intolerance which forcing rather than leading, persecuted in the name of righteousness? For there are subtle transformations possible in our characters, which will bring the old faults out in new guises, and we are none, not one, quite free from intolerance. The churches have creeds; but applicants for admission are usually given to understand that they need not be fully accepted; and they seldom are. The Theosophical Society has no creeds, but its members seem scarcely able to avoid making them in spite of all efforts to the contrary. And watchfulness as to the Theosophical movement must lead those who believe in the Masters to see how strenuously they and their mouth-piece H.P.B. are working against the development of them. If this Theosophical movement is to be carried on successfully through the three or four generations of the first seventy-five years of the coming century, we must be very heedful. What do the Constitution and the by-laws of the Society, what does the application for admission into it tell us? Not one word as to belief. They simply contain provisions which tend to guarantee liberty and cultivate tolerance. Is it not contrary to their spirit to say: “Once accept the philosophy you must accept her”? Accept C OMMENTS ON T HE T HEOSOPHICAL S OCIETY  119"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"what philosophy? The Society has none. Not long since an earnest student searching for Truth, but not one of our members, asked if we were not Jesuitical. Was her position not well taken? It was, if we as a Society have a philosophy. We constantly cry out we have no creeds, no dogmas, no beliefs, and we almost as constantly, or at any rate very frequently, unintentionally give the lie to this. And why speak of the Society as an absurdity without Masters? Are its objects, especially the first, nothing? If those objects were even partially lived up to, and again let us say “especially the first,” would no good come of it? Most certainly, and it is perhaps this good which the Masters are seeking, rather than the acceptance of any philosophy, or any recognition of themselves.* Even a recognized authoritative leader may be dangerous. H.P.B. herself is always inculcating self-reliance, and discouraging any dependence upon others, herself included. She understands that the true alchemist seeks to have men throw their opinions into one common melting pot, knowing that they will take out all of the Truth which they put in, and some of their errors transmuted. It is the real change of base metals into gold. If the Society has an authoritative leader, beliefs will be accepted simply on authority, and a belief thus accepted is almost of necessity perverted. Look at the doctrines of Karma and Reincarnation. Many regard it as quite heterodox not to accept them; and yet the first is often made a fetish of, and both are by many crudely understood; the one often being looked at in a way to make of it a positive fatalism, the other a kind of personal resurrection. This comes from reliance upon certain persons or books accepted as authority. Such reliance is against the presumable wish of the Masters. We must seize on our own truth and digest it ourselves: and if we do we cannot so pervert it. A true servant should try not simply to obey, but, if possible, to intuitively grasp the wishes of the one served. In the article referred to in this paper it is said that H.P.B., is ——————— * Our Brother, Mr. Patterson, is quite correct.—[H.P.B.] ——————— 1 20  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS “willing to efface herself if thereby her mission might the better prosper” And would she n ot say “First Humanity and then the Theosophical Society, and last myself”.* Referring to the Coulomb scandal it is said “But then, instead of closing up around the assailed Teacher, and defending to the utmost her position and her honour, the fatal policy was adopted of attempting to minimise her position in the Society”. True, perhaps; but how best could she have been defended? An ill-planned sortie is, of course, unwise There may be a hidden enemy in wait, and we are told that the powers of darkness are very active, vigilant and cunning. We may, in ill-advised movements be simply following out their hypnotic suggestions; and any statement which does not tally with the exact truth is an ill-advised sortie . And when it is said that: “If there are no Masters, the Theosophical"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Society is an absurdity, and there is no use in keeping it up”, a mis-statement is made. Let us by all means close round our teacher, but as she would have us; not as we ourselves might like. And to do this we must remember that we must lead, not force, people to the truth We must do it with all tenderness, all gentleness, all patience, all sweetness. We must present our views for the weak ones, not the strong ones. Not in the way of temporising, but by giving out those truths which are most needed We must try to understand that we are now to learn to be true shepherds when our time comes, and while being schooled must bear in mind that it is the lost sheep we are to save. The honest materialist, the honest agnostic, the honest spiritualist, the honest christian-scientist, the honest dogmatic christian, may be an honest disbeliever in H. P. B. and the Masters, and an honest member of the Theosophical Society too, provided he is enlisted in the cause of humanity. † Let us hold the ——————— * Most decidedly so; such has been always my principle, and I hope it is that of my friend and colleague, C ol.

We can thus best serve, thus best defend. This is not a policy of silence; it does not prevent our using pen and voice in defence of our beloved leader; but it should prevent making belief in her a qualification, even if an unwritten one, for membership in good standing in the Theosophical Society. There are now many good members who are doubters on this point. Don’t let us drive them away by intolerance. Perhaps they are under a dark illusion cast by the Brothers of the Shadow. But to force them will not help them, and do no good to any one. If, metaphorically speaking, we slap the face of any one who may speak disrespectfully of H.P.B., we will not help her reputation but rather strengthen the calumniator in his attitude. Our line of defence cannot be well chosen if it does harm. And it will do harm if made in such a way as to make a belief in any person or philosophy a criterion of good standing. Let us stand shoulder to shoulder; let us strengthen those ties which we are forming for this and the coming incarnations; let us by all means be grateful to her from whom so much has come to us and the rest of humanity, but let us for the sake of others be judicious. Let us make disbelievers in H.P.B., disbelievers in Karma, disbelievers in Reincarnation, disbelievers in the Masters as welcome, or more welcome, into the Society than others, provided always they wish to form the nucleus of a universal brotherhood.

The two Powers are inseparable on our present plane and at this stage of evolution, and would be meaningless, one without the other. They are, therefore, the two opposite poles of the One Manifested Creative Power, whether the latter is viewed as a Universal Cosmic Force which builds worlds, or under its anthropomorphic aspect, when its vehicle is thinking man. For Ormuzd and Ahriman are the respective representatives of Good and Evil, of Light and Darkness, of the spiritual and the material elements in man, and also in the Universe and everything contained in it. Hence the world and man are called the Macrocosm and the Microcosm, the great and the small universe, the latter being the reflection of the former.

As the translator of the Vendidad writes, “Long before the Parsis had heard of Europe and Christianity, commentators, explaining the myth of Tahmurath, who rode for thirty years on Ahriman as a horse, interpreted the feat of the old legendary king as the curbing of evil passions and restraining Ahriman in the heart of man.”† The same writer broadly sums up Magism in this wise:— The world, such as it is now, is twofold, being the work of two hostile beings, Ahura Mazda, the good principle, and Angra Mainyu, the evil principle; all that is good in the world comes from the former, all that is bad in it comes from the latter. The history of the world is the history of their conflict, how Angra Mainyu invaded the world of Ahura Mazda and marred it, and how he shall be expelled from it at last. Man is active in the conflict, his duty in it being laid before him in the law revealed by Ahura Mazda to Zarathustra.

They do not believe in Satan or the Devil, and therefore, their religious system cannot in truth be termed dualistic . A good proof of this was afforded about half a century ago, at Bombay, when the Rev. Dr. Wilson, the Orientalist, debated the subject with the Parsi high-priests, the Dasturs . The latter very philosophically denied his imputation, and demonstrated to him that far from accepting the texts of their Sacred Books literally, they regarded them as allegorical as far as Ahriman was concerned. For them he is a symbolical representation of the disturbing elements in Kosmos and of the evil passions and animal instincts in man ( Vendidad ). † Vendidad , trans. by J.

Attention is drawn to the sentences italicised by the writer, as they are esoteric. For the Sacred Books of the Mazdeans as all the other sacred Scriptures of the East (the Bible included), have to be read esoterically. The Mazdeans had practically two religions, as almost all the other ancient nations—one for the people and the other for the initiated priests. Esoterically, then, the underlined sentences have a special significance, the whole meaning of which can be obtained only by the study of occult philosophy. Thus, Angra Mainyu, being confessedly, in one of its aspects, the embodiment of man’s lowest nature, with its fierce passions and unholy desires, “his hell” must be sought for and located on earth . In occult philosophy there is no other hell—nor can any state be comparable to that of a specially unhappy human wretch. No “asbestos” soul, inextinguishable fires, or “worm"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"that never dies,” can be worse than a life of hopeless misery upon this earth. But it must, as it has once had a beginning, have also an end. Ahura Mazda alone,* being the divine, and therefore the immortal and eternal symbol of “Boundless Time,” is the secure refuge the spiritual haven of man. And as Time is twofold, there being a measured and finite time within the Boundless, Angra Mainyu is only a periodical and temporary Evil. He is Heterogeneity as developed from Homogeneity. Descending along the scale of differentiating nature on the cosmic planes, both Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu become, at the appointed time, the representatives and the dual type of man, the inner or divine I NDIVIDUALITY , and the outer personality , a compound of visible and invisible elements and principles. As in heaven, so on earth; as above, so below. If the divine light in man, the Higher Spirit-Soul, forms including itself, the seven Amesh € spends (of which Ormuzd ——————— * Ahura Mazda stands here no longer as the supreme One God of eternal G ood and Light , but as its own Ray, the divine EGO which informs man—under whatever name. ——————— T HOUGHTS ON O RMUZD AND A HRIMAN  127 i s the seventh, or the synthesis), Ahriman, the thinking personality the animal soul, has in its turn its seven Archidevs opposed to the seven Amesh ā spends. Du ring our life cycle, the good Yazatas, the 99,999 Fravashi (or Ferouers) and even the “Holy Seven”, the Amesh ā spends themselves,* are almost prowerless against th e Host of wicked Devs—the symbols of cosmic opposing powers and of human passions and sins.† Fiends of evil, their presence radiates and fills the world with moral and physical ills: with disease, poverty, envy and pride, with despair, drunkenness, treachery, injustice, and cruelty, with anger and bloody-handed murder. Under the advice of Ahriman, man from the first made his fellow-man to weep and suffer. This state of things will cease only on the day when Ahura Mazda, the sevenfold deity, assumes his seventh name‡ or aspect. Then, will he send his “Holy Word” Mathra Spenta (or the “Soul of Ahura”) to incarnate in Saoshyant Sosiosh), and the latter will conquer Angra Mainyu. Sosiosh is the prototype of “the faithful and the true” of the Revelation , and the same as Vishnu in the Kalki-avatara . Both are expected to appear as the Saviour of the World , seated on a white horse and followed by a host of spirits or genii, mounted likewise on milk-white steeds.¶ And then, men will arise from the dead and immortality come.§ ——————— * The gods of light, the “immortal seven,” of whom Ahura Mazda is the seventh.

It stands in the occult sense, that m aterialism and sin being called death, the materialist, or the unbeliever, is “a dead man”—spiritually. Occultism has never regarded the physical personality as the man; nor has Paul, if his Epistle to the Romans (vi-vii), is correctly understood. Thus mankind, arrived “at the appointed time” (the end of our present Round ), at the end of the cycle of gross material flesh, will, with certain bodily changes, have come to a clearer spiritual perception of the truth. Redemption from flesh means a proportionate redemption from sin. Many are those who seeing will believe , and, in consequence, rise “from the dead.” By the middle of the Seventh Race, says an occult prophecy, the struggle of the two conflicting Powers ( Buddhi and Kama-Manas ) will have almost died out. Everything that is irredeemably sinful and wicked, cruel and destructive, will have been eliminated, and that which is found to survive will be swept away from being, owing, so to speak, to a Karmic tidal-wave in the shape of scavenger-plagues, geological convulsions and other means of destruction. The Fifth Round will bring forth a higher kind of Humanity; and, as intelligent Nature always proceeds gradually, the last Race of this Round must necessarily develop the needed materials thereof. Meanwhile, we are still in the Fifth Race of the Fourth Round only, and in the Kaliyuga, into the bargain. The deadly strife between spirit and matter, between Light and Goodness and Darkness and Evil, began on our globe with the first appearance of contrasts and opposites in vegetable and animal nature, and continued more fiercely than ever after man had become the selfish and personal being he now is . Nor is there any chance of its coming to an end before falsehood is replaced by truth, selfishness by altruism, and supreme justice reigns in the heart of man. Till then, the noisy battle will rage unabated. It is selfishness, especially; the love of Self above all things in heaven and earth, helped by human vanity, which is the begetter of the seven mortal sins. No; Ashmogh, the cruel “biped serpent,” is not so easily reduced. Before the poor creature now in the clutches of Darkness is T HOUGHTS ON O RMUZD AND A HRIMAN  129 l iberated through Light, it has to know itself. Man, following the Delphic injunction, has to become acquainted with, and gain the mastery over, every nook and corner of his heterogeneous nature, before he can learn to discriminate between HIMSELF and his"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"personality . To accomplish this difficult task, two conditions are absolutely requisite: one must have thoroughly realised in practice the noble Zoroastrian precept: “Good thoughts, good words, good deeds,” and must have impressed them indelibly on his soul and heart, not merely as a lip-utterance and form-observance. Above all, one has to crush personal vanity beyond resurrection. Here is a suggestive fable and a charming allegory from the old Zoroastrian works. From the first incipient stage of Angra Mainyu’s power, he and his wicked army of fiends opposed the army of Light in everything it did. The demons of lust and pride, of corruption and impiety, systematically destroyed the work of the Holy Ones. It is they who made beautiful blossoms poisonous; graceful snakes, deadly; bright fires, the symbol of deity, full of stench and smoke; and who introduced death into the world. To light, purity, truth, goodness and knowledge, they opposed darkness, filth, falsehood, cruelty and ignorance. As a contrast to the useful and clean animals created by Ahura Mazda, Angra Mainyu created wild beasts and bloodthirsty fowls of the air. He also added insult to injury and deprecated and laughed at the peaceful and inoffensive creations of his elder brother. “It is thine envy,” said the holy Yazatas one day to the unholy fiend, the evil-hearted, “Thou art incapable of producing a beautiful and harmless being, O cruel Angra Mainyu”. . . The arch-fiend laughed and said that he could. Forthwith he created the loveliest bird the world had ever seen. It was a majestic peacock, the emblem of vanity and selfishness, which is self-adulation in deeds. “Let it be the King of Birds,” quoth the Dark One, “and let man worship him and act after his fashion .” From that day “Melek Taus” (the Angel Peacock) became the special creation of Angra Mainyu, and the 130  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS messenger through which the arch-fiend is invoked by some* and propitiated by all men. H ow often does one see strong-hearted men and determined women moved by a strong aspiration towards an ideal they know to be the true one, battling successfully, to all appearance, with Ahriman and conquering him. Their external Selves have been the battle-ground of a most terrible, deadly strife between the two opposing Principles; but they have stood firmly—and won. The dark enemy seems conquered; it is crushed in fact, so far as the animal instincts are concerned. Personal selfishness, that greed for self, and self only, the begetter of most of the evils—has vanished; and every lower instinct, melting like soiled icicles under the beneficent ray of Ahura Mazda, the radiant E GO -S UN , has d isappeared, making room for better and holier aspirations. Yet, there lurks in them their old and but partially destroyed vanity, that spark of personal pride which is the last to die in man. Dormant it is, latent and invisible to all, including their own consciousness; but there it is still.

Man accumulates knowledge, invents religions and philosophies, but himself remains still the same. In his ceaseless chase after wealth and honours and the will-o’-the-wisps of novelty, enjoyment and ambition, he is ever moved by one chief motor—vain selfishness. In these days of so-called progress and civilization, when the light of knowledge claims to have replaced almost everywhere the darkness of ignorance, how many more volunteers do we see added to the army of Ahura Mazda, the Principle of Good and Divine Light? Alas, the recruits of Angra Mainyu, the Mazdean Satan, outnumber these, daily more and more. They have overrun the world, these worshippers of Melek Taus, and the more they are enlightened the easier they succumb. This is only natural. Like Time , both the boundless and the finite, Light is also twofold; the divine and the eternal, and the artificial light , which paradoxically but correctly defined, is the darkness of Ahriman . Behold on what objects the best energies of knowledge, the strongest human activity, and the inventive powers of man are wasted at the present hour: on the creation, amelioration and perfection of war-engines of destruction, on guns and smokeless powders, and weapons for the mutual murder and decimation of men. Great Christian nations seek to outvie each other in the discovery of better means for destroying human life, and for the subjecting by the strongest and the craftiest of the weakest and the simplest, for no better reason than to feed their peacock-vanity and self-adulation; and Christian men eagerly follow the good example. Whereon is spent the enormous wealth accumulated through private enterprize by the more enlightened through the ruin of the less intelligent? Is it to relieve human suffering in every form, that riches are so greedily pursued? Not at all. For now, just as 1,900 years ago, while the beggar Lazarus is glad to feed on the crumbs that fall from the rich man’s table, no means are neglected by Dives to hedge himself off from the poor.

G reat is the power of Ahriman! Time rolls on, leaving with every day the ages of ignorance and superstition further behind, but bringing us in their stead only centuries of ever-increasing selfishness and pride. Mankind grows and multiplies, waxes in strength and (book-) wisdom; it claims to have penetrated into the deepest mysteries of physical nature; it builds railroads and honeycombs the globe with tunnels; it erects gigantic towers and bridges, minimizes distances, unites the oceans and divides whole continents. Cables and telephones, canals and railways more and more with every hour unite into one “happy” family, but only to furnish the selfish and the wily with every means of stealing a better march on the less selfish and improvident. Truly the “upper ten” of science and wealth have subjected to their sweet will and pleasure, the Air and the Earth, the Ocean and the Fire. This, our age, is one of progress, indeed, an era of the most triumphant display of human genius. But what good has all this great civilization and progress done to the millions in the European slums, to the armies of the “great unwashed”? Have any of these displays of genius added one comfort more to the lives of the poor and the needy? Is it not true to say that distress and starvation are a hundred times greater now than they were in the days of the Druids or of Zoroaster? And is it to help the hungry multitudes that all this is invented, or again, only to sweep off the couch of the rich the last-forgotten rose-leaves that may uncomfortably tickle their well-fed bodies? Do electric wonders give one additional crust of bread to the starving? Do the towers and the bridges, and the forests of factories and manufactures, bring any mortal good to the sons of men, save giving an additional opportunity to the wealthy to vampirize or “sweat” their poorer brother? When, I ask again, at what time of the history of mankind, during its darkest days of ignorance, when was there known such ghastly starvation as we see now? When has the poor man wept and suffered, as he weeps and suffers in the present day—say, in London, where for every club-visitor who dines T HOUGHTS ON O RMUZD AND A HRIMAN  133 a nd wines himself daily, at a price that would feed twenty-five families for a whole day, one may count hundreds and thousands of starving wretches. Under the very windows of the fashionable City restaurants, radiant with warmth and electric lights, old trembling women and little children may be seen daily, shivering and fastening their hungry eyes on the food they smell each time the entrance door is opened. Then they “move on”—by order, to disappear in the dark gloom, to starve and shiver and finally to die in the frozen mud of some gutter. . . .

And yet even a minor light (if such) when practically applied for the good of suffering mankind, is a thousand times more beneficent than even infinite Light, when confined to the realm of abstract theories. In our days the latter Light has only succeeded in raising the pride of Christian nations to its acme, in developing their self-adulation, and fostering hard-heartedness under the name of all-binding law. The “personality” of both nation and individual has thrown deep roots into the soil of selfish motives; and of all the flowers of modern culture those that blossom the most luxuriously are the flowers of polite Falsehood, Vanity, and Self-exaltation.

O f late, Theosophists in general, and the writer of the present paper especially, have been severely taken to task for disrespect to science . We are asked what right we have to question the conclusions of the most eminent men of learning, to refuse recognition of infallibility (which implies omniscience) to our modern scholars? How dare we, in short, “contemptuously ignore” their most undeniable and “universally accepted theories,” etc . , etc . This article is written with the intention of giving some reasons for our sceptical attitude . To begin with, in order to avoid a natural misunderstanding in view of the preceding paragraph, let the reader at once know that the title, “The N EGATORS of Science,” applies i n nowise to Theosophists . Quite the reverse . By “Science” we here mean A NCIENT W ISDOM , while its “Negators” represent m odern materialistic Scientists . Thus we have once more “the sublime audacity” of, David-like, T HE N EGATORS OF S CIENCE   139 c onfronting, with an old-fashioned theosophical sling for our only weapon, the giant Goliath “armed with a coat of mail,” and weighing “five thousand shekels of brass ,” truly . Let the Philistine deny facts, and substitute for them his “working hypotheses : ” we reject the latter and defend facts , “the armies of the one living T RUTH . ” Th e frankness of this plain statement is certain to awake all the sleeping dogs, and to set every parasite of modern science snapping at our editorial heels . “Those wretched"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Theosophists!” will be the cry . “How long shall they refuse to humble themselves; and how long shall we bear with this evil congregation?” Well, it will certainly take a considerable time to put us down, as more than one experiment has already shown . Very naturally, our confession of faith must provoke the wrath of every sycophant of the mechanical and animalistic theories of the Universe and Man; and the numbers of these sycophants are large, even if not very awe-inspiring . In our cycle of wholesale denial the ranks of the Didymi are daily reinforced by every new-baked materialist and so-called “infidel,” who escapes, full of reactive energy, from the narrow fields of church dogmatism . We know the numerical strength of our foes and opponents, and do not underrate it . More : in this present case even some of our best friends may ask, as they have done before now : “ Cui bono ? why not leave our highly respectable, firmly-rooted, official Science, with her scientists and their flunkeys, severely alone?” Further on it will be shown why ; when our friends will learn that we have very good reason to act as we do . With the true, genuine man of science, with the earnest, impartial, unprejudiced and truth-loving scholar—of the minority, alas! we can have no quarrel, and he has all our respect . But to him who, being only a specialist in physical sciences—however eminent, matters not—still tries to throw into the scales of public thought his own materialistic views upon metaphysical and psychological questions (a dead letter to him) we have a good deal to say . Nor are we bound by any laws we know of, divine or human, to respect opinions which are held erroneous in our school, only because they are 140  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS those of so-called authorities in materialistic or agnostic circles . Between truth and fact (as we understand them) and the working hypotheses of the greatest living physiologists—though they answer to the names of Messers . Huxley, Claude Bernard, Du Bois-Reymond, etc . , etc . —we hope never to hesitate for one instant . If, as Mr . Huxley once declared, soul, immortality and all spiritual things “lie outside of [his] philosophical enquiry” ( Physical Basis of Life ),* then, as he has never enquired into these questions, he has no right to offer an opinion . They certainly lie outside the grasp of materialistic physical science, and, what is more important, to use Dr . Paul Gibier’s felicitous expression, outside the luminous zone of most of our materialistic scientists . These are at liberty to believe in the “ automatic action of nervous centres” as primal creators of thought; that the phenomena of will are only a complicated form of reflex actions, and what not—but we are as much at liberty to deny their statements . They are specialists—no more . As the author of Le Spiritisme ( fakirisme occidental ) admirably depicts it, in his latest work : — A number of persons, extremely enlightened on some special point of science, take upon themselves the r ight of pronouncing arbitrarily their judgment on all things; are ready to reject everything new which shocks their ideas, often for the sole reason that if it were true they could not remain ignorant of it !

In every subsequent edition of his Pedigree of Man he has left uncorrected the sozoura (“unknown to science”, Quatrefages tells us), and his prosimiae allied to the loris , which he describes as “without marsupial bones, but with placenta ” ( Pedigree of Man , p . 77), when years ago it has been proved by the anatomical researches of messrs . “Alphonse Milne-Edwards and Grandidier . . . that the prosimiae of Haeckel have no decidua . . . no placenta ” (Quatrefages, The Human Species , p . 110*) .

And yet Haeckel palms them off still, on the innocent, and the sycophants of Darwinism, only, as Quatrefages explains, “because the proof of their existence arises from the necessity of an intermediate type”!!

Both are forgeries— and we have a right to denounce both . The same with regard to other branches of science . A specialist—say a Greek or Sanskrit scholar, a paleographer, an archaeologist, an Orientalist of any description—is an “authority” only within the limits of his special science just as is an electrician or a physicist in theirs . And which of these may be called infallible in his conclusions? They have made, and still go on making mistakes, each of their hypotheses being only a surmise, a theory for the time being—and no more . Who would believe today, with Koch’s craze upon us, that hardly a few years ago, the greatest authority on pathology in France, the late Professor Vulpian, Doyen of the Faculty of Medicine in Paris, denied the existence of the tubercular microbe ? When, says Doctor Gibier, (his friend and pupil) M . Bouley laid before the Academy of Sciences a paper on the tubercular baccillus, he was told by Vulpian that “this germ could not exist ,” for “had it existed it would have been discovered before now, having been hunted after for so many years!”* Just in the same way every scientific specialist of whatever description denies the doctrines of Theosophy and its teachings; not that he has ever attempted to study or analyze them, or to discover how much truth there may be in the old sacred science, but simply because it is not modern science that has discovered any of them; and also because,"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"having once strayed away from the main road into the jungles of material speculation, the men of science cannot return back without pulling down the whole edifice after them .

He fondly imagines himself “as one of us,” and for no more cogent reason than had the Zouave : he, too, beats the big drum for every Oxford or Cambridge Don whose conclusions and personal views do not agree with the teachings of the Occult Doctrine of antiquity . To devote, however, to these braggarts with tongue or pen one line more than is strictly necessary, would be waste of time . Let them go . They have not even a “zone” of their own, but have to see things through the light of other people’s intellectual “zones . ” And now to the reason why we have once more the painful duty of challenging and contradicting the scientific views of so many men considered each more or less “eminent,” in his special branch of science . Two years ago, the writer promised in The Secret Doctrine , Vol . II, p . 798, a third and even a fourth volume of that work . This third volume (now almost ready) treats of the ancient Mysteries of Initiation, gives sketches—from the esoteric stand-point—of many of the most famous and historically known philosophers and hierophants (every one of whom is set down by the Scientists as an impostor ), from the archaic down to the Christian era, and traces the teachings of all these sages to one and the same source of all knowledge and science—the esoteric doctrine or W ISDOM -R ELIGION . N o need our saying that from the esoteric and legendary materials used in the forthcoming work, its statements and conclusions differ greatly and often clash irreconcilably with the data given by almost all the English and German Orientalists .

In this the Orientalists, even those who are materialists, are the best allies of the clergy and biblical chronology . We need not stop to analyze this strange fact, but such it is . Now the main point of Volume III of The Secret Doctrine is to prove, by tracing and explaining the blinds in the works of ancient Indian, Greek, and other philosophers of note, and also in all the ancient Scriptures—the presence of an uninterrupted esoteric allegorical method and symbolism; to show, as far as lawful, that with the keys of interpretation as taught in the Eastern Hindo-Buddhistic Canon of Occultism, the Upanishads , the Pur ā nas , t he Sutras , the Epic poems of India and Greece, the Egyptian Book of the Dead , the Scandinavian Eddas , as well as the Hebrew Bible , and even the classical writings of Initiates (such as Plato, among others)—all, from first to last, yield a meaning quite different from their dead letter texts . This is flatly denied by some of the foremost scholars of the day . They have not got the keys, ergo— no such keys can exist . According to Dr .

Thus, as the personal conclusions and claims of the above-named scholars (and of many more) militate against the theosophical teachings, in this generation, at any rate, the laurels of conquest will never be accorded by the majority to the latter . Nevertheless, since truth and fact are on our side, we need not despair, but will simply bide our time . Time is a mighty conjuror; an irresistible leveller of artificially grown weeds and parasites, a universal solvent for truth . Magna est veritas et prevalebit . Meanwhile, however, the Theosophists cannot allow themselves to be denounced as visionaries, when not “frauds,” and it is their duty to remain true to their colours, and to defend their most sacred beliefs . This they can do only by opposing to the prejudiced hypotheses of their opponents, ( a ) the diametrically opposite conclusions of their colleagues—other scientists as eminent specialists in the same branches of study as themselves; and ( b ) the true meaning of sundry passages disfigured by these partizans, in the old scriptures and classics . But to do this, we can pay no more regard to these illustrious personages in modern science, than they do to the gods of the “inferior races . ” Theosophy, the Divine Wisdom or T RUTH is, no more than w a s a certain tribal deity—“a respecter of persons . ” We are on the defensive, and have to vindicate that which we know to be implicit truth : hence, for a few editorials to come, we contemplate a series of articles refuting our opponents—however learned . And now it becomes evident why it is impossible for us to “leave our highly respectable, firmly-rooted official science severely alone . ” Meanwhile we may close with a few parting words to our readers Power belongs to him who knows ; this is a very old axiom : knowledge, or the first step to power, especially that of comprehending the truth, of discerning the real from the false—belongs only to those who place truth above their own petty personalities . Those only who having freed themselves from every prejudice, and conquered their human conceit and selfishness, are ready to accept every and T HE N EGATORS OF S CIENCE   149 an y truth—once the latter is undeniable and has been demonstrated to them—those alone, I say, may hope to get at the ultimate knowledge of things .

The majority judge of a work according to the respective prejudices of its critics, who in their turn are guided by the popularity or unpopularity of the authors, certainly never by its intrinsic faults or merits . Outside theosophical circles, therefore, the forthcoming volumes of The Secret Doctrine are sure to receive at the hands of the general public a still colder welcome than their two predecessors have found . * In our day, as has been proved repeatedly, no statement can hope for a fair trial, or even hearing, unless its arguments run on the lines of legitimate and accepted enquiry, remaining strictly within the boundaries of either official, materialistic science, or emotional, orthodox theology .

They might serve as a caution even to those amongst us, who, hardened in almost a life-long struggle in the service of our Cause, are neither timid with their pens, nor in the least disconcerted or appalled by the dogmatic assertions of scientific “authorities . ” And yet they persist in their work, although perfectly aware that, do what they may, neither materialism nor doctrinal pietism will give theosophical philosophy a fair hearing in this age .

As well ask us to replace Darwin by Jack the Giant-Killer!” Quite so; for those who would shirk any moral responsibility it seems certainly more convenient to accept descent from a common simian ancestor, and see a brother in a dumb, tailless baboon, rather than acknowledge the fatherhood of the Pitris, the fair “sons of the gods,” or to have to recognize as a brother, a starveling from the slums, or a copper-coloured man of an “inferior” race . “Hold back!” shout in their turn the pietists, “you can never hope to make respectable church-going Christians—‘ Esoteric Buddhists ’!” Nor are we in any way anxious to attempt the metamorphosis; the less so, since the majority of the pious Britishers T HE N EGATORS OF S CIENCE  151 h ave already, and of their own free will and choice, become Exoteric Boothists .

Jowett is right, in his Preface to Timaeus , in stating that “the fancies of the Neo-Platonists . . . have nothing to do with the interpretation of Plato,” and that “the so-called mysticism of Plato is purely Greek, arising out of his imperfect knowledge,” not to say ignorance . The learned Master of Balliol denies the use of any esoteric symbology by Plato in his works . We Theosophists maintain it and must try to give our best proofs for the claims preferred .

Though, where the truth of our doctrines is concerned, no criticism and no amount of ridicule can intimidate us, we would nevertheless be sorry to give one more handle to our enemies, as a pretext for an extra slaughter of the innocent; nor would we willingly lead our friends into an unjust suspicion of that to which we are not in the least prepared to plead guilty . One of such suspicions would naturally be the idea that we must be terribly self-opinionated and conceited . This would be false from A to Z . It does not at all stand to reason that because we contradict eminent professors of Science on certain points, we therefore claim to know more than they do of Science; nor, that we even have the benighted vanity of placing ourselves on the same level as these scholars . Those who would accuse us of this would simply be talking nonsense, for even to harbour such a thought would be the madness of conceit—and we have never been guilty of this vice . Hence, we declare loudly to all our readers that most of those “authorities” we find fault with, stand in our own opinion immeasurably higher in scientific knowledge and general information than we do . But, this conceded, the reader is reminded that great scholarship in no way precludes great bias and prejudice; nor is it a safeguard against personal vanity and pride . A Physicist may be an T HE N EGATORS OF S CIENCE   153 u ndeniable expert in acoustics, wave-vibrations, etc . , and be no Musician at all, having no ear for music . None of the modern bootmakers can write as Count Leo Tolstoi does; but any tyro in decent shoemaking can take the great novelist to task for spoiling good materials in trying to make boots . Moreover, it is only in the legitimate defence of our time-honoured Theosophical doctrines, opposed by many on the authority of materialistic Scientists, entirely ignorant of psychic possibilities, in the vindication of ancient Wisdom and its Adepts, that we throw down the gauntlet to Modern Science . If in their inconceivable conceit and blind materialism they will go on dogmatizing upon that about which they know nothing—nor do they want to know—then those who do know something have a right to protest and to say so publicly and in print . Many must have heard of the suggestive answer made by a lover of Plato to a critic of Thomas Taylor, the translator of the works of this great Sage . Taylor was charged with being but a poor Greek scholar, and not a very good English writer . “True,” was the pert reply; “Tom Taylor may have known far less Greek than his critics; but he knew Plato far better than any of them does . ”* And this we take to be our own position ."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"We claim no scholarship in either dead or living tongues, and we take no stock in Philology as a modern Science .

There are those who have preserved the knowledge of it, and also of the arcane meaning of the Mysteries; and it is from these Masters that the writer of the present protest had the good fortune of learning, howbeit imperfectly, the said language . Hence her claim to a more correct comprehension of the arcane portion of the ancient texts written by avowed Initiates—such as were Plato and Iamblichus, Pythagoras, and even Plutarch—than can be claimed by, or expected from, those who, knowing nothing whatever of that “language” and even denying its existence altogether, yet set forth authoritative and conclusive views on everything Plato and Pythagoras knew or did not know, believed in or disbelieved . It is not enough to lay down the audacious proposition, “that an ancient Philosopher is to be interpreted from himself [ i . e . , from the dead-letter texts] and by the contemporary history of thought ”;* he who lays it down has first of all to prove to the satisfaction, not of his admirers and himself alone, but of all , that modern thought does not woolgather in the question of Philosophy as it does on the lines of materialistic Science . Modern thought denies Divine Spirit in Nature, and the Divine element in mankind, the Soul’s immortality and every noble conception inherent in man . We all know that in their endeavors to kill that which they have agreed to call “superstition” and the “relics of ignorance” ( read “religious feelings and metaphysical concepts of the Universe and Man”), Materialists like Prof .

In both cases they forfeit their right to esteem as authorities . For, if they are blind to facts and sincere in their blindness, then their learning, however great, will do more harm than good, and if, while fully alive to those universal truths which Antiquity knew better than we do—though it did express them in more ambiguous and less scientific language—our Philosophers will still keep them under the bushel for fear of painfully dazzling the majority’s eyes, then the example they set is most pernicious . They suppress the truth and disfigure metaphysical conceptions, as their colleagues in physical Science distort facts in material Nature into mere props to support their respective views, on the lines of popular hypotheses and Darwinian thought . And if so, what right have they to demand a respectful hearing from those to whom T RUTH is the highest, as the noblest, of all religions? Th e negation of any fact or claim believed in by the teeming millions of Christians and non-Christians, of a fact, moreover, impossible to disprove , is a serious thing for a man of recognized scientific authority, in the face of its inevitable results . Denials and rejections of certain things, hitherto held sacred, coming from such sources, are for a public taught to respect scientific data and bulls , as good as unqualified assertions . Unless uttered in the broadest spirit of Agnosticism and offered merely as a personal opinion, such a spirit of wholesale negation—especially when confronted with the universal belief of the whole of Antiquity, and of the incalculable hosts of the surviving Eastern nations in the things denied—becomes pregnant with dangers to mankind . Thus the rejection of a Divine Principle in the Universe, of Soul and Spirit in man and of his Immortality, by one set of Scientists; and the repudiation of any Esoteric Philosophy existing in Antiquity, hence, of the presence of any hidden meaning based on that system of revealed learning in the sacred writings of the East (the Bible included), or in the works of those Philosophers who were confessedly Initiates, by another set of “authorities”—are simply fatal to humanity .

This would only be fair, and more prudent too, in the face of a whole array of evidence to the contrary, embracing thousands of years in the past . And it would be more honest than to lead less learned people than themselves into grave errors, by allowing those under the hypnotic influence of “authority,” and thus but too inclined to take every ephemeral hypothesis on trust, to accept as proven that which has yet to be proved . But the “authorities” act on different lines .

The story of Vishnu and his Trivikrama or “three strides” and the “demon” Bali runs as follows . The “demon” Bali, curiously enough, is said to have been an exceedingly good and virtuous Daitya King, who defeated Indra, humbled the Gods and extended his sovereignty over the three worlds, by his devotion and penance . In fact he was a pious and holy ascetic, like many other “demons” in the Pur ā nas , for the Asuras, as The Secret Doctrine has already explained at length, are divine Egos, fallen into matter or incarnated in human forms, the Christian myth of the “Fallen Angels” having the same significance . Accordingly the Gods appealed to Vishnu for protection, and the Deity manifested himself in the Dwarf Avatara in order to restrain Bali . Thus he approached Bali and craved the boon of three steps of ground . Bali at once granted his request, and the God stepped over heaven and the upper FOOTNOTES TO “THE PURANAS”  159 earth (air) in two strides; but in consideration of Bali’s goodness, he stopped short and left to him P ā t ā la, esoterically the earth .

At the end of the Kalpa he vomits forth fire and so destroys all the creation . At the Churning of the Ocean (of Space), Shesha was twisted round the Mountain Mandara, and used as a great rope to cause it to revolve . The Gods were at the one end of the rope and the Demons at the other . The hood of Shesha, the thousand-headed cobra, is called the “Island of Jewels,” and his palace is said to be “jewelled walled . ” But these gems are not of earth, as the merest tyro in symbology will at once perceive; they are the Jewels of Wisdom and Self-knowledge .

His own Western philosophy suffices amply for him, and all the deep researches of the almost infinite past signify nothing but a curious history of philosophy to be criticised and observed from a position which he thinks has far transcended them . We believe that actuated by such a spirit our Western scholars will never learn the true significance of Eastern thought . On their own statement they do not want to; and the true pandit, the inheritor, not merely of the capacity to con Sanskrit manuscripts, but who also is master of the profound knowledge contained in them, will take these self-sufficient students at their word . —————"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME XIII 1891 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES [ L ucifer , Vol .

Theosophical criticism will have to go deeper than a merely literary review . Sir Edwin Arnold, the author of the unparalleled Light of Asia , has tried to make his peace with the Christian world by means of a ruse which oversteps even the large licence allowed to the priests of the Muses . He has cast the honied cake to the hound of Hades, but whether Cerberus will wag his tail at the sop or not, is still a question . Surely the ethical teaching and life of Jesus, whether legendary or actual, whether of a real man or of an ideal type of manhood, were themes noble enough for the poet’s skill without the transparent fiction, the unworthy tour de passe-passe , which we shall have to describe! The somewhat pretentious title is not a creation of the poet’s mind . Not to speak of the time honoured Lux Mundi of the Latin Church, we have the suggestion of the name in a certain public criticism made by Sir Monier Monier-Williams who, some two years ago, in a lecture more against than about Buddhism and the Lord Buddha, in order to please his audience, endeavoured to belittle the happy title ——————— * By Sir Edwin Arnold .

In fact the “Light of the World” was used by the lecturer as a pair of theological snuffers to put out that which was only the “Light of Asia . ” We regret to see the partial success of the criticism; for the claim put forward in the title, though a pleasant tinkling in the ears of the ill-informed, is simply in a line with the modern advertisement system in the eyes of the truly learned . But we can let that go without further remarks in the pages of Lucifer , for the claim is not new and the Theosophical Society is a living protest against the further scattering of such seeds of dissension among the votaries of the various world-religions, of which the aggressive West has hitherto been so industrious a sower . And now for Sir Edwin’s pious subterfuge . Surely the mantle of Eusebius must have fallen upon him! The “Light of the World” to be so must, of course, put the “Light of Asia” into the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"shade . How was that to be managed, and at the same time place the scenes of the poem in the orthodox pigeon-holes of chronology and geography? Happy thought! Make the Magi Buddhists , since Cologne has made them already Germans, and bring one of them back to be converted, after the death of the Great Teacher, by Mary Magdalene . Make Mary Magdalene the hostess of a palatial house, a Galilean ch ā telaine , a nd the protagoniste of t he Tragedy, and bring in one or two who were raised from the dead and of whom history sayeth naught further, as chorus—and the thing is done! But truth alone can make us free and not fiction, however poetical . We will leave the criticism of biblical names and places to those who are already busy with them, merely pointing out the following coincidences . Let us turn to Renan’s Vie de Jésus pp . 27 and 28,* and to Sir Edwin Arnold’s poem p . 106 .

Par une dépression entre la montagne de Sulem et le Thabor, s’entrevoient la vallée due Jourdain . . . . . . ” Thus we find in instances more than we can enumerate, that the English poet has a llowed himself to be deeply inspired by M . Renan, the “Paganini du Christianisme . ” And why not? Did not the author of La Vie de Jésus proceed on the very identical lines of fancy"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"as Sir Edwin? Does he not call Jesus in the same breath “le charmant Docteur” and “un Dieu ressucité” donné au monde par “la passion d’une hallucinée . ” We now turn to the Buddhist (!) Magus and his utterances . Objecting to the term “Our Father” as the naming of the unnameable, he says : “Yet is the Parabrahm unspeakable” which is true in itself, but strange in the lips of a Buddhist . We have always learned that Buddhism was a protest against Brahminism and that Parabrahm was a Vedantic term! Otherwise we might have read on drowsily into the state of dreams and heard without surprise Mary retorting : “But Allah is the only God!” But the rude shock kept us awake and we were only mollified by the following beautiful reply of the Indian Magus . 168  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS “ We have a scroll which saith : ‘ Worship , but name no name! blind are those eyes Which deem th ’ unmanifested manifest , Not comprehending Me in My True Self , Imperishable , viewless , undeclared .

Name not My Name !’ Also a verse runs in our Holy Writ : — ‘ Richer than heavenly fruit on Vedas growing ; Greater than gifts ; better than prayer or fast ; Such sacred silence is! Man , this way knowing , Comes to the utmost , perfect , Peace at last’!” The chief points which the fictitious Hindu Magus is made to yield by his s elf-constituted prosecutor, advocate, jury and judge, are now to be noticed . “Yet, truly, nowise have we known before W isdom so packed and perfect, as thy Lord’s, Giving that Golden Rule that each shall do Unto his fellow as he would have done Unto himself . . . . . ” Let us take down from our shelves any book on comparative religion, say Moncure C onway’s Sacred Anthology or Max Müller’s Introduction to the Science of Religion . * On page 249 of the latter we read italics and all : “According to Buddha, the motive of all our actions should be p ity or love for our neighbor . “And as in Buddhism, so even in the writing of Confucius we find again what we value most in our own religion .

Of course we know that the Bhagavad-gita is not a Buddhist sutta, but since Sir Edwin has brought Parabrahm into court to prop up his case, we think ourselves justified in sending him to his own translation to refresh his memory about the true Yogi . In Book the Third, Krishna ( the Higher Ego ) thus speaks : — “No man shall ’scape from act B y shunning action; nay, and none shall come By mere renouncements unto perfectness .

There is a task of holiness to do, Unlike world binding toil, which bindeth not The faithful soul; such earthly duty do Free from desire, and thou shalt well perform Thy heavenly purpose . ” And so on we might quote for pages .

To one thing alone we can give our unqualified approval; viz . , that the poet disposes most summarily of Javeh and does not fall into the vulgar error of confounding Christianity with exoteric Judaism and its “jealous God . ” The volume is fitly dedicated to “The Queen’s most excellent Majesty . ” Later on we may again refer to the matter and let our readers hear what a Buddhist has to say on the subject . —————"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME XIII 1891 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES [On April 14, 1891, Annie Besant delivered an address before the Aryan T .

Read by Annie Besant at the afternoon session of April 26 . Also published in Lucifer Vol . VIII, June, 1891, pp . 343-45 . ] T O THE B OSTON C ONVENTION , T . S . , 1891 . For the third time since my return to Europe in 1885, I am able to send to my brethren in Theosophy and fellow citizens of the United States a delegate from England to attend the annual Theosophical Convention and speak by word of mouth my greeting and warm congratulations . Suffering in body as I am continually, the only consolation that remains to me is to hear of the progress of the Holy Cause to which my health and strength have been given; but to which, now that these are going, I can offer only my passionate devotion and never-weakening good wishes for its success and welfare . The news therefore that comes from America, mail after mail, telling of new Branches and of well-considered and patiently worked-out plans for the advancement of Theosophy cheers and gladdens me with its evidences of growth, more than words can tell . Fellow Theosophists, I am proud of your noble work in the New World; Sisters and Brothers of America, I thank and I bless you for your unremitting labours for the common cause, so dear to us all . Let me remind you all once more that such work is now more than ever needed . The period which we have now reached in the cycle that will close between 1897-8 is, and 172  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS will continue to be, one of great conflict and continued strain . If the T . S . can hold through it, good; if not, while Theosophy will remain unscathed, the Society will perish—perchance most ingloriously—and the World will suffer . I fervently hope that I may not see such a disaster in my present body . The critical nature of the stage on which we have entered is as well known to the forces that fight against us as to those that fight on our side . No opportunity will be lost of sowing dissension, of taking advantage of mistaken and false moves, of instilling doubt, of augmenting difficulties, of breathing suspicions, so that by any and every means the unity of the Society may be broken and the ranks of our"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Fellows thinned and thrown into disarray . Never has it been more necessary for the Members of the T . S . to lay to heart the old parable of the bundle of sticks, than it is at the present time : divided, they will inevitably be broken, one by one; united, there is no force on Earth able to destroy our Brotherhood . Now I have marked with pain a tendency among you, as among the Theosophists in Europe and India, to quarrel over trifles, and to allow your very devotion to the cause of Theosophy to lead you into disunion . Believe me, that apart from such natural tendency, owing to the inherent imperfections of Human Nature, advantage is often taken by our ever-watchful enemies of your noblest qualities to betray and to mislead you . Sceptics will laugh at this statement, and even some of you may put small faith in the actual existence of the terrible forces of these mental, hence subjective and invisible, yet withal living and potent, influences around all of us . But there they are, and I know of more than one among you who have felt them, and have actually been forced to acknowledge these extraneous mental pressures . On those of you who are unselfishly and sincerely devoted to the Cause, they will produce little, if any, impression . On some others, those who place their personal pride higher than their duty to the T . S . , higher even than their Pledge to their divine SELF , the effect is generally disastrous . Self-watchfulness is never more necessary than when a personal wish to lead, and wounded vanity, dress themselves in the L ETTER TO THE F IFTH A NNUAL C ONVENTION  173 p eacock’s feathers of devotion and altruistic work; but at the present crisis of the Society a lack of self-control and watchfulness may become fatal in every case . But these diabolical attempts of our powerful enemies—the irreconcilable foes of the truths now being given out and practically asserted—may be frustrated . If every Fellow in the Society were content to be an impersonal force for good, careless of praise or blame so long as he subserved the purpose of the Brotherhood, the progress made would astonish the World and place the Ark of the T . S . out of danger . Take for your motto in conduct during the coming year, “Peace with All who love Truth in sincerity,” and the Convention of 1892 will bear eloquent witness to the strength that is born of unity . Your position as the fore-runners of the sixth sub-race of the fifth root-race has its own special perils as well as its special advantages . Psychism, with all its allurements, and all its dangers, is necessarily developing among you, and you must beware lest the Psychic outruns the Manasic and Spiritual development . Psychic capacities held perfectly under control, checked and directed by the Manasic principle, are valuable aids in development . But these capacities running riot, controlling instead of controlled, using instead of being used, lead the Student into the most dangerous delusions and the certainty of moral destruction . Watch therefore carefully this development, inevitable in your race and evolution-period so that it may finally work for good and not for evil; and receive, in advance, the sincere and potent blessings of Those whose good-will will never fail you, if you do not fail yourselves . Here in England I am glad to be able to report to you that steady and rapid progress is"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"being made . Annie Besant will give you details of our work, and will tell you of the growing strength and influence of our Society; the reports which she bears from the European and British Sections speak for themselves in their record of activities . The English character, difficult to reach, but solid and tenacious when once aroused, adds to our Society a valuable factor, and there are being laid in England strong and firm 174  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS foundations for the T . S . of the twentieth century . Here, as with you, attempts are being successfully made to bring to bear the influence of Hindu on English thought, and many of our Hindu brethren are now writing for Lucifer short and clear papers on Indian philosophies . As it is one of the tasks of the T . S . to draw together the East and the West, so that each may supply the qualities lacking in the other, and develop more fraternal feelings among Nations so various, this literary intercourse will, I hope, prove of the utmost service in Aryanising Western thought . The mention of Lucifer reminds me that the now assured position of that magazine is very largely due to the help rendered at a critical moment by the American Fellows . As my one absolutely unfettered medium of communication with Theosophists all over the World, its continuance was of grave importance to the whole Society . In its pages, month by month, I give such public teaching as is possible on Theosophical doctrines, and so carry on the most important of our Theosophical work . The magazine now just covers its expenses, and if Lodges and individual Fellows would help in increasing its circulation, it would become more widely useful than it is at the present time . Therefore, while thanking from the bottom of my heart all those who so generously helped to place the magazine on a solid foundation, I should be glad to see a larger increase in the number of regular subscribers, for I regard these as my pupils, among whom I shall find some who will show the capacity for receiving further instruction . And now I have said all; I am not sufficiently strong to write you a more lengthy message, and there is the less need for me to do so, as my friend and trusted messenger, Annie Besant, she who is my right arm here, will be able to explain to you my wishes more fully and better than I can write them . After all, every wish and thought I can utter are summed up in this one sentence, the never-dormant wish of my heart, “Be Theosophists, Work for Theosophy!”—Theosophy first, and Theosophy last; for its practical realisation alone can save the Western World from that selfish and unbrotherly feeling that now divides race from L ETTER TO THE F IFTH A NNUAL C ONVENTION  175 r ace, one nation from the other; and from that hatred of class and social strifes, that are the"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"curse and disgrace of so-called Christian peoples . Theosophy alone can save it from sinking entirely into that mere luxurious materialism in which it will decay and putrefy as older civilizations have done . In your hands, Brothers, is placed in trust the welfare of the coming century; and great as is the trust, so great is also the responsibility . My own span of life may not be long, and if any of you have learned aught from my teachings, or have gained by my help a glimpse of the True Light, I ask you, in return, to strengthen the cause by the triumph of which that True Light, made still brighter and more glorious through your individual and collective efforts, will lighten the World, and thus to let me see, before I part with this worn-out body, the stability of the Society secured . May the blessings of the past and present great Teachers rest upon you .

I had a good remplacement , as my ambassador, Count Zaluski, who had been a pupil of Liszt, was able himself to accompany me . You will be astonished when I tell you that, having chosen for the first piece in the programme my transcription for the violin of a C sharp minor polonaise by Chopin, a musical piece of the most intrinsic value and poetic depths, the Emperor, when I had finished, intimated to Count Ito, his first minister, that I should play it again . The Japanese taste is good . I was laden with presents of untold value, one item only being a gold-lacquer box of the seventeenth century . I played in Hong Kong and outside Canton, no European being allowed to live inside . There I made an interesting excursion to the Portugese possession of Macao, visiting the cave where Camoens wrote his Lusiad . It was very interesting to see outside the Chinese town of Macao, a European Portuguese town, which to this day has remained unchanged since the sixteenth century . In the midst of the exquisite tropical vegetation of Java, and despite the terrific heat, I gave sixty-two concerts in sixty-seven days, travelling all over the island, inspecting its antiquities, the chief of which is a most wonderful Buddhist temple, the Boro Budhur, or Many Buddhas . This building contains six miles of figures, and is a solid pile of stone, larger than the pyramids . They have, these Javans, an extraordinarily sweet orchestra in the national Samelang, which consists of percussion instruments played by eighteen people; but to hear this orchestra, with its most weird Oriental chorus and ecstatic dances, one must have had the privilege of being invited by the Sultan of Solo, ‘Sole Emperor of the World . ’ I have seen and heard nothing more dreamy and poetic than the Serimpis danced by nine Royal Princesses . ” Where are the Aesthetes of a few years ago? Or was this little confederation of the l overs of art but one of the soap-bubbles of our fin de siècle , rich in promise and suggestion of many a possibility, but dead in works and act? Or, if there are any true lovers of art yet left among them, why do they not organize and send out missionaries the world over, to tell picturesque Japan and other countries ready to fall victims that, to imitate the will-o’-the-wisp of European culture and fascination, means for a non-Christian land, the committing of suicide; that it means sacrificing one’s individuality for an empty show and shadow; at best C IVILIZATION , THE D EATH OF A RT AND B EAUTY  179 i t is to exchange the original and the picturesque for the vulgar and the hideous . Truly and indeed it is high time that at last something should be done in this direction, and before the deceitful civilization of the conceited nations of but yesterday has irretrievably hypnotized the older races, and made them succumb to its upas-tree wiles and supposed superiority . Otherwise, old arts and artistic creations, everything original and unique will very soon disappear . Already national dresses and time-honoured customs, and everything beautiful, artistic, and worth preservation is fast disappearing from view . At no distant day, alas, the best relics of the past will perhaps be found only in museums in sorry, solitary, and be-ticketed samples preserved under glass! Such is the work and the unavoidable result of our modern civilization . Skin-deep in reality in its visible effects, in the “blessings” it is alleged to have given to the world, its roots are rotten to the core . It is to its progress that selfishness and materialism, the greatest curses of the nation, are due; and the latter will most surely lead to the annihilation of art and of the appreciation of the truly harmonious and beautiful . Hitherto, materialism has only led to a universal tendency to unification on the material plane and a corresponding"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"diversity on that of thought and spirit . It is this universal tendency, which by propelling humanity, through its ambition and selfish greed, to an incessant chase after wealth and the obtaining at any price of the supposed blessings of this life, causes it to aspire or rather gravitate to one level, the lowest of all—the plane of empty appearance . Materialism and indifference to all save the selfish realization of wealth and power, and the over-feeding of national and personal vanity, have gradually led nations and men to the almost entire oblivion of spiritual ideals, of the love of nature to the correct appreciation of things . Like a hideous leprosy our Western civilization has eaten its way through all the quarters of the globe and hardened the human heart . “Soul-saving” is its deceitful, lying pretext; greed for additional revenue through opium, rum, and the inoculation of European vices—the real aim . In the far East it 180  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS has infected with the spirit of imitation the higher classes of the “pagans”—save China, w hose national conservatism deserves our respect; and in Europe it has engrafted fashion —save the mark—even on the dirty,—starving proletariat itself! For the last thirty years, as if some deceitful semblance of a reversion to the ancestral type—awarded to men by the Darwinian theory in its moral added to its physical characteristics—were contemplated by an evil spirit tempting mankind, almost every race and nation under the Sun in Asia has gone mad in its passion for aping Europe . This, added to the frantic endeavour to destroy Nature in every direction, and also every vestige of older civilizations—far superior to our own in arts, godliness, and the appreciation of the grandiose and harmonious—must result in such national calamities . Therefore, do we find hitherto artistic and picturesque Japan succumbing wholly to the temptation of justifying the “ape theory” by simianizing its populations in order to bring the country on a level with canting, greedy and artificial Europe! For certainly Europe is all this . It is canting and deceitful from its diplomats down to its custodians of religion, from its political down to its social laws, selfish, greedy and brutal beyond expression in its grabbing characteristics . And yet there are those who wonder at the gradual decadence of true art, as if art could exist without imagination, fancy, and a just appreciation of the beautiful in Nature, or without poetry and high religious, hence, metaphysical aspirations! The galleries of paintings and sculpture, we hear, become every year poorer in quality, if richer in quantity . It is lamented that while there is a plethora of ordinary productions, the greatest scarcity of remarkable pictures and statuary prevails . Is this not most evidently due to the facts that ( a ) the artists will very soon remain with no better models than nature morte (or “still life”) to inspire themselves with; and ( b ) that the chief concern is not the creation or artistic objects, but their speedy sale and profits? Under such conditions, the fall of true art is only a natural consequence ."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"C IVILIZATION , THE D EATH OF A RT AND B EAUTY  181 O wing to the triumphant march and the invasion of civilization, Nature, as well as man and ethics, is sacrificed, and is fast becoming artificial . Climates are changing, and the face of the whole world will soon be altered . Under the murderous hand of the pioneers of civilization, the destruction of whole primeval forests is leading to the drying up of rivers, and the opening of the Canal of Suez has changed the climate of Egypt as that of Panama will divert the course of the Gulf Stream . Almost tropical countries are now becoming cold and rainy, and fertile lands threaten to be soon transformed into sandy deserts . A few years more and there will not remain within a radius of fifty miles around our large cities one single rural spot inviolate from vulgar speculation . In scenery, the picturesque and the natural is daily replaced by the grotesque and the artificial . Scarce a landscape in England but the fair body of nature is desecrated by the advertisements of “Pears’ Soap” and “Beecham’s Pills . ” The pure air of the country is polluted with smoke, the smells of greasy railway-engines, and the sickening odours of gin, whiskey, and beer . And once that every natural spot in the surrounding scenery is gone, and the eye of the painter finds but the artificial and hideous products of modern speculation to rest upon, artistic taste will have to follow suit and disappear along with them . “No man ever did or ever will work well, but either from actual sight or sight of faith,” says Ruskin, speaking of art . Thus, the first quarter of the coming century may witness painters of landscapes, who have never seen an acre of land free from human improvement; and painters of figures whose ideas of female beauty of form will be based on the wasp-like pinched-in waists of corseted, hollow-chested and consumptive society belles . It is not from such models that a picture deserving of the definition of Horace—“a poem without words”—is produced . Artificially draped Parisiennes and London Cockneys sitting for Italian contadini or Arab Bedouins can never replace the genuine article; and both free Bedouins and genuine Italian peasant girls are, thanks to “civilization,” fast becoming things of the past . Where 182  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS shall artists find genuine models in the coming century, when the hosts of the free Nomads o f the Desert, and perchance all the negro-tribes of Africa—or what will remain of them after their decimation by Christian cannons, and the rum and opium of the Christian civilizer—will have donned European coats and top hats? And that this is precisely what awaits art under the beneficial progress of modern civilization, is self-evident to all . Aye! let us boast of the blessings of civilization, by all means . Let us brag of our sciences and the grand discoveries of the age, its achievements in mechanical arts, its railroads, telephones and electric batteries; but let us not forget, meanwhile, to purchase at"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"fabulous prices (almost as great as those given in our day for a prize dog, or an old prima donna’s song) the paintings and statuary of uncivilized, barbarous antiquity and of the middle ages : for such objects of art will be reproduced no more . Civilization has tolled their eleventh hour . It has rung the death-knell of the old arts, and the last decade of our century is summoning the world to the funeral of all that was grand, genuine, and original in the old civilizations . Would Raphael, O ye lovers of art, have created one single of his many Madonnas had he had, instead of Fornarina and the once Juno-like women of the Trastevere of Rome to inspire his genius, only the present-day models, or the niched Virgins of the nooks and corners of modern Italy, in crinolines and high-heeled boots? Or would Andrea del Sarto have produced his famous “Venus and Cupid” from a modern East End working girl one of the latest victims to fashion—holding under the shadow of a gigantic hat à la mousquetaire , feathered like the scalp of an Indian chief, a dirty, scrofulous brat from the slums? How could Titian have ever immortalized his golden-haired patrician ladies of Venice, had he been compelled to move all his life in the society of our actual “professional beauties,” with their straw-coloured, dyed capillaries that transform human hair into the fur of a yellow Angora cat? May not one venture to state with the utmost confidence that the world would never have had the C IVILIZATION , THE D EATH OF A RT AND B EAUTY  183 A thena Lemnia of Phidias—that ideal of beauty in face and form— had Aspasia, the Milesian, or the fair daughters of Hellas, whether in the days of Pericles or in any other, disfigured that “form” with stays and bustle, and coated that “face” with white enamel, after the fashion of the varnished features of the mummies of the dead Egyptians . We see the same in architecture . Not even the genius of Michelangelo himself could have failed to receive its death-blow at the first sight of the Eiffel Tower, or the Albert Hall, or more horrible still, the Albert Memorial . Nor, for the matter of that, could it have received any suggestive idea from the Colosseum and the palace of the Caesars, in their present whitewashed and repaired state! Whither, then shall we, in our days of civilization, go to find the natural, or even simply the picturesque? Is it still to Italy, to Switzerland or Spain? But the Bay of Naples—even if its waters be as blue and transparent as on the day when the people of Cumæ selected its shores for a colony and its surrounding scenery as gloriously beautiful as ever—thanks to that spirit of mimicry which has infected sea and land, has now lost its most artistic and most original features . It is bereft of its lazy, dirty, but intensely picturesque figures of old; of its lazzaroni and barcaiòlos , its fishermen and country girls . Instead of the former’s red or blue Phrygian cap, and the latter’s statuesque, half-nude figure and poetical rags, we see now-a-days but the caricatured specimens of modern civilization and fashion . The gay tarantella resounds no longer on the cool sands of the moonlit shore; it is replaced by that libel on Terpsychore, the modern quadrille, in the gas-lit, gin-smelling sailor’s trattorias . Filth still pervades the land, as of yore; but it is made the more apparent on the threadbare city coat, the mangled chimney-pot hat and the once fashionable, now castaway European bonnet . Picked up in the hotel gutters, they now"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"grace the unkempt heads of the once picturesque Neapolitans . The type of the latter has died out, and there is nothing to distinguish the lazzaroni from the Venetian gondoliere , the Calabrian brigand, or the London street-sweeper and beggar . The still, sunlit waters of Canal Grande bear no longer 184  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS their gondolas, filled on festival days with gaily dressed Venetians, with picturesque b oatmen and girls . The black gondola that glides silently under the heavy carved balconies of the old patrician palazze, reminds one now more of a black floating coffin, with a solemn-looking, dark-clothed undertaker paddling it on towards the Styx, than of the gondola of thirty years ago . Venice looks more gloomy now than during the days of Austrian slavery from which it was rescued by Napoleon III . Once on shore, its gondoliere is scarcely distinguishable from his “fare,” the British M . P . on his holiday-tour in the old city of the Doges . Such is the levelling hand of all-destroying civilization . It is the same all over Europe . Look at Switzerland . Hardly a decade ago, every Canton had its distinguishing national costume, as clean and fresh as it was peculiar . Now the people are ashamed to wear it . They want to be mistaken for foreign guests, to be regarded as a civilized nation which follows suit even in fashion . Cross over to Spain . Of all the relics of old, the smell of rancid oil and garlic is alone left to remind one of the poetry of the old days in the country of the Cid . The graceful mantilla has almost disappeared; the proud hidalgo-beggar has taken himself off from the street-corner; the nightly serenades of lovesick Romeos are gone out of fashion, and the duenna contemplates going in for woman’s rights . The members of the “Social Purity” Associations may say “thank God” to this and lay the change at the door of Christian and moral reforms of civilization . But has morality gained anything in Spain with the disappearance of the nocturnal lovers and duennas? We have every right to say, no . A Don Juan outside a house is less dangerous than one inside . Social immorality is as rife as ever—if not more so, in Spain, and it must be so, indeed, when even Harper ’ s Guide Book quotes in its last edition as follows : “Morals in all classes, especially in the higher, are in the most degraded state . Veils, indeed, are thrown aside, and serenades are rare, but gallantry and intrigue are as active as ever . The men think little of their married obligations; the women . . . are willing victims of unprincipled gallantry . ” ( Spain , “Madrid,” page C IVILIZATION , THE D EATH OF A RT AND B EAUTY  185 6 78 . ) In this, Spain is but on a par with all other countries civilized or now civilizing, and is assuredly not worse than many another country that could be named; but that which may be said of it with truth is, that what it has lost in poetry through civilization, it has gained"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"in hypocrisy and loose morals . The Cortejo has turned into the petit crevé ; the castanets have become silent, because, perhaps, the noise of the uncorked champagne bottles affords more excitement to the rapidly civilizing nation; and the “Andalouse au teint bruni” having taken to cosmetics and face-enamel, “la Marquesa d’ Almedi” may be said to have been buried with Alfred de Musset . The gods have indeed been propitious to the Alhambra . They have permitted it to be burnt before its chaste Moresque beauty had been finally desecrated, as are the rock-cut temples of India, the Pyramids and other relics by drunken orgies . This superb relic of the Moors had already suffered, once before, by Christian improvement . It is a tradition still told in Granada, and history too, that the monks of Ferdinand and Isabella had made of Alhambra—that “palace of petrified flowers dyed with the hues of the wings of angels”—a filthy prison for thieves and murderers . Modern speculators might have done worse; they might have polluted its walls and pearl-inlaid ceilings, the lovely gilding and stucco, the fairy-like arabesques, and the marble and gossamer-like carvings, with commercial advertisements, after the Inquisitors had already once before covered the building with whitewash and permitted the prison-keepers to use Alhambra Halls for their donkeys and cattle . Doubting but little that the fury of the Madrilenos for imitating the French and English must have already, at this stage of modern civilization, infected every province of Spain, we may regard that lovely country as dead . A friend speaks, as an eye-witness, of “cocktails” spilled near the marble fountain of the Alhambra, over the blood-marks left by the hapless Abancerages slain by Boabdil, and of a Parisian cancan pur sang performed by working girls and soldiers of Granada, in the Court of Lions! 186  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS But these are only trifling signs of the time and the spread of culture among the middle a nd lower classes. Wherever the spirit of aping possesses the heart of the nation—the poor working classes—there the elements of nationality disappear and the country is on the eve of losing its individuality and all things change for the worse . What is the use of talking so loudly of “the benefits of Christian civilization,” of its having softened public morals, refined national customs and manners, etc . , etc . , when our modern civilization has achieved quite the reverse! Civilization has depended, for ages, says Burke, “upon two principles . . . . the spirit of a gentleman and the spirit of religion . ” And how many true gentlemen have we left, when compared even with the days of half-barbarous knighthood? Religion has become canting hypocrisy and the genuine religious spirit is regarded now-a-days as insanity . Civilization, it is averred, “has destroyed brigandage, established public security, elevated morality and built railways which now honeycomb the face of the globe . ” Indeed? Let us analyze seriously and impartially all these “benefits” and we shall soon find that civilization has done nothing of the kind . At best it has put a false nose on every evil of the Past, adding hypocrisy and false pretence to the natural ugliness of each . If it is true to say that it has put down in some civilized centres of Europe—near Rome, in"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"the Bois de Boulogne or on Hampstead Heath— banditti and highwaymen, it is also as true that it has, thereby, destroyed robbery only as a speciality, the latter having now become a common occupation in every city great or small . The robber and cut-throat has only exchanged his dress and appearance by donning the livery of civilization—the ugly modern attire . Instead of being robbed under the vault of thick woods and the protection of darkness, people are robbed now-a-days under the electric light of saloons and the protection of trade-laws and police-regulations . As to open day-light brigandage, the Mafia of New Orleans and the Mala Vita of Sicily, with high officialdom, population, police, and jury forced to play into the hands of regularly organized bands of murderers, thieves and C IVILIZATION , THE D EATH OF A RT AND B EAUTY  187 t yrants* in the full glare of European “culture,” show how far our civilization has succeeded in establishing public security, or Christian religion in softening the hearts of men and the ways and customs of a barbarous past . Modern Cyclopædias are very fond of expatiating upon the decadence of Rome and its pagan horrors . But if the latest editions of the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography were honest enough to make a parallel between those “monsters of depravity” of ancient civilization, Messalina and Faustina, Nero and Commodus, and modern European aristocracy, it might be found that the latter could give odds to the former—in social hypocrisy, at any rate . Between “the shameless and beastly debauchery” of an Emperor Commodus, and as beastly a depravity of more than one “Honourable,” high official representative of the people, the only difference to be found is that while Commodus was a member of all the sacerdotal colleges of Paganism, the modern debauchee may be a high member of the Evangelical Christian Churches, a distinguished and pious pupil of Moody and Sankey and what not . It is not the Calchas of Homer, who was the type of the Calchas in the Operette La Belle Hélène , but the modern sacerdotal Pecksniff and his followers . As to the blessings of railways and “the annihilation of space and time,” it is still an undecided question—without speaking of the misery and starvation the introduction of steam engines and machinery in general has brought for years on those who depend on their manual labour—whether railways do not kill more people in one month that the brigands of all Europe used to murder in a whole year . The victims of railroads, moreover, are killed under circumstances which surpass in horror anything the cut-throats may have devised . One reads almost daily of railway disasters in which people are “burned to death in the blazing wreckage,” “mangled and crushed out of recognition” and ——————— * Read the “Cut Throats’ Paradise” in the E dinburgh Review for April, 1877, and the digest of it in the Pall Mall Gazette of April 15th, 1891, “Murder as a Profession . ” ———————"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"188  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS killed by dozens and scores . * This is a trifle worse than the highwaymen of old Newgate .

Speak of Christian civilization having improved public morals; of Christianity being the only religion which has established and recognized Universal Brotherhood! Look at the brotherly feeling shown by American Christians to the Red Indian and the Negro, whose citizenship is the farce of the age . Witness the love of the Anglo-Indians for the “mild Hindu,” the Mussulman, and the Buddhist . See “how these Christians love each other” in their incessant law litigations, their libels against each other, the mutual hatred of the Churches and of the sects .

Two of the men were killed outright and the remaining three were injured, pinioned in the wreckage . As the flames reached them their cries and groans were heartrending .

Finally, that the work, for reasons that will be now explained, has no system in it; and that it looks in truth, as remarked by a friend, as if a mass of independent paragraphs having no connection with each other, had been well shaken up in a waste-basket, and then taken out at random and—published . Such is also now my sincere opinion . The full consciousness of this sad truth dawned upon me when, for the first time after its publication in 1877, I read the work through from the first to the last page, in India in 1881 .

What I am determined to do is to give facts , undeniable and not to be gainsaid, simply by stating the peculiar, well known to many but now almost forgotten, circumstances, under which I wrote my first English work . I give them seriatim . (1) . When I came to America in 1873, I had not spoken English—which I had learned in my childhood colloquially—for over thirty years . I could understand when I read it, but could hardly speak the language . (2) . I had never been at any college, and what I knew I had taught myself; I have never pretended to any scholarship in the sense of modern research; I had then hardly read any scientific European works, knew little of Western philosophy and sciences . The little which I had studied and learned of these, disgusted me with its materialism, its limitations, narrow cut-and-dried spirit of dogmatism, and its air of superiority over the philosophies and sciences of antiquity . (3) . Until 1874 I had never written one word in English, nor had I published any work in any language . Therefore— (4) . I had not the least idea of literary rules . The art of writing books, of preparing them for print and publication, reading and correcting proofs, were so many close secrets to me . (5) .

I had no plan; did not know whether it would be an essay, a pamphlet, a book, or an article . I knew that I had to write it , that was all . I began the work before I knew Colonel Olcott well, and some months before the formation of the Theosophical Society . Thus, the conditions for becoming the author of an English theosophical and scientific work were hopeful, as everyone will see . Nevertheless, I had written enough to fill four such volumes as Isis , before I submitted my work to Colonel Olcott . Of course he said that everything save the pages dictated—had to be rewritten . Then we started on our literary labours and worked together every evening . Some pages the English of which he had corrected, I copied : others which would yield to no mortal correction, he used to real aloud from my pages, Englishing them verbally as he went on, dictating to me from my almost undecipherable MSS . It is to him that I am indebted for the English in Isis . It is he again who suggested that the work should be divided into chapters, and the first volume devoted to S CIENCE and the second to T HEOLOGY . To do this, the matter had to be re-shifted, and m any of the chapters also; repetitions had to be erased, and the literary connection of subjects attended to . When the work was ready, we submitted it to Professor Alexander Wilder, the well known scholar and Platonist of New York, who after reading the matter, recommended it to Mr . Bouton for publication . Next to Colonel Olcott, it is Professor Wilder who did the most for me . It is he who made the excellent Index , who corrected the Greek, Latin and Hebrew words, suggested quotations and wrote the greater part of the Introduction “Before the Veil . ” If this was not acknowledged in the work, the fault is not mine, but because it was Dr . Wilder’s express wish that his name should not appear except in footnotes . I have never made a secret of it, and every one of my numerous acquaintances in New York knew it . When ready the work went to press . From that moment the real difficulty began . I had no idea of correcting galley-proofs; Colonel Olcott had little leisure to do so; and the result was that I made a mess of it M Y B OOKS   199 f rom the beginning . Before we were through with the first three chapters, there was a bill of six hundred dollars for corrections and alterations, and I had to give up the proofreading . Pressed by the publisher, Colonel Olcott doing all that he possibly could do, but having no time except in the evenings, and Dr . Wilder far away at Jersey City, the result was that the proofs and pages of Isis passed through a number of willing but not very careful hands, and were finally left to the tender mercies of the publisher’s proof-reader . Can one wonder after this if “Vaivaswata” (Manu) became transformed in the published volumes into “Viswamitra,” that thirty-six pages of the Index were irretrievably lost, and quotation-marks placed where none were needed (as in some of my own sentences!), and left out entirely in many a passage cited from various authors? If asked why these fatal mistakes have not been corrected in a subsequent edition, my answer is simple : the plates were stereotyped; and notwithstanding all my desire to do so, I could not put it into"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"practice, as the plates were the property of the publisher; I had no money to pay for the expenses, and finally the firm was quite satisfied to let things be as they are, since, notwithstanding all its glaring defects, the work—which has now reached its seventh or eighth edition, is still in demand . And now—and perhaps in consequence of all this—comes a new accusation : I am charged with wholesale plagiarism in the introductory Chapter “Before the Veil”! Well, had I committed plagiarism, I should not feel the slightest hesitation in admitting the “borrowing . ” But all “parallel passages” to the contrary, as I have not done so, I do not see why I should confess it; even though “thought tranference” as the Pall Mall Gazette wittily calls it, is in fashion, and at a premium just now . Since the day when the American press raised a howl against Longfellow, w ho, borrowing from some (then) unknown German translation of the Finnish epic, the Kalevala , published it as his own superb poem, Hiawatha , and forgot to acknowledge the source of his inspiration, the Continental press has repeatedly brought out other like accusations . The present year is 200  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS especially fruitful in such “thought transferences . ” Here we have the Lord Mayor of the City of London, repeating word for word an old forgotten sermon by Mr . Spurgeon and swearing he had never read or heard of it . The Rev . Robert Bradlaugh writes a book, and forthwith the Pall Mall Gazette denounces it as a verbal copy from somebody else’s work . Mr . Harry de Windt, the Oriental traveller, and a F . R . G . S . to boot, finds several pages out of his just published A Ride to India , across Persia and Baluchistan , in the London Academy , paralleled with extracts from The Country of Baluchistan , by A . W . Hughes, which are identical verbatim et literatim . Mrs . Parr denies in the British Weekly that her novel Sally was borrowed consciously or unconsciously from Miss Wilkins’ Sally , and states that she had never read the said story, nor even heard the author’s name, and so on . Finally, every one who has read La Vie de Jésus , by Renan, will find that he has plagiarised by anticipation , some descriptive passages rendered in flowing verse in the Light of the World . Yet even Sir Edwin Arnold, whose versatile and recognized genius needs no borrowed imagery, has failed to thank the French Academician for his pictures of Mount Tabor and Galilee in prose, which he has so elegantly versified in his last poem. Indeed, at this stage of our civilisation and fin de siècle, one should feel highly honoured to be placed in such good and numerous company, even as a—plagiarist . But I cannot claim such a privilege and, simply for the reason already told that out of the whole Introductory chapter “Before the Veil,” I can claim as my own only certain passages in the Glossary appended to it, the Platonic portion of it, that which is now denounced as “a bare-faced plagiarism” having been written by Professor A . Wilder . That gentleman is still living in or near New York, and can be asked whether my statement is true or not . He is too honourable, too great a scholar, to deny or fear anything . He insisted upon a kind of Glossary , explaining the Greek and Sanskrit names and words with which the work abounds, being appended to an Introduction, and furnished a few"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"himself . I begged him to give me a short summary of M Y B OOKS   201 t he Platonic philosophers, which he kindly did . Thus from p . 11 down to 22 the text is his, save a few intercalated passages which break the Platonic narrative, to show the identity of ideas in the Hindu Scriptures . Now who of those who know Dr . A . Wilder personally, or by name, who are aware of the great scholarship of that eminent Platonist, the editor of so many learned works,* would be insane enough to accuse him of “plagiarising” from any author’s work! I give in the foot-note the names of a few of the platonic and other works he has edited . The charge would be simply preposterous! The fact is that Dr . Wilder must have either forgotten to place quotes before and after the passages copied by him from various authors in his Summary; or else, owing to his very difficult handwriting, he has failed to mark them with sufficient clearness . It is impossible, after the lapse of almost fifteen years, to remember or verify the facts . To this day I had imagined that this disquisition on the Platonists was his, and never gave a further thought to it . But now enemies have ferretted out unquoted passages and proclaim louder than ever “the author of Isis Unveiled ,” to be a plagiarist and a fraud . Very likely more may be found, as that work is an inexhaustible mine of misquotations, errors and blunders, to which it is impossible for me to plead “guilty” in the ordinary sense . Let then the slanderers go on, only to find in another fifteen years as they have found in the preceding period, that whatever they do, they cannot ruin Theosophy , nor even hurt me . I have no author’s vanity; and years of unjust persecution and abuse have made me entirely callous to what the public may think of me—personally . But in view of the facts as given above; and considering that— ( a ) The language in Isis is not mine; but (with the exception of that portion of the work which, as I claim, was dictated ), may be called only a sort of translation of my facts and ideas into English; 202  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS ( b ) It was not written for the public,—the latter having always been only a secondary consideration with me—but for the use of Theosophists and members of the Theosophical Society to which Isis is dedicated; ( c ) Though I have since learned sufficient English to have been enabled to edit two magazines—the Theosophist and Lucifer— yet, to the present hour I never write an article,"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"an editorial or even a simple paragraph, without submitting its English to close scrutiny and correction . Considering all this and much more, I ask now every impartial and honest man and woman whether it is just or even fair to criticize my works— Isis , above all others—as one would the writings of a born American or English author! What I claim in them as my own is only the fruit of my learning and studies in a department, hitherto left uninvestigated by Science, and almost unknown to the European world . I am perfectly willing to leave the honour of the English grammar in them, the glory of the quotations from scientific works brought occasionally to me to be used as passages for comparison with, or refutation by, the old Science, and finally the general make-up of the volumes, to every one of those who have helped me . Even for The Secret Doctrine there are about half-a-dozen Theosophists who have been busy in editing it, who have helped me to arrange the matter, correct the imperfect English, and prepare it for print . But that which none of them will ever claim from the first to last, is the fundamental doctrine, the philosophical conclusions and teachings . Nothing of that have I invented, but simply given it out as I have been taught; or as quoted by me in The Secret Doctrine (Vol .

The young woman had repeated the fusty slander which is so sweet to the nostrils of certain persons, that the Corresponding Secretary of the Theosophical Society is a Russian spy . This is part of the reply : — “There are only three or four lines which refer to me . The dozen other persons who are lied about in this work of unique fiction are invited to take care of themselves . As for me it is enough for me to answer the four distinct falsehoods and the libel for which the author is responsible on my account alone . These falsehoods are based on no foundation whatever, save perhaps on public gossip and the efforts of those good souls who think that the best way of ‘entertaining people’ is to serve them with slices of freshly murdered reputations . This particular calumny is an ancient three-years-old slander, picked up from the gutters of Anglo-Indian hill stations, and revived to serve a special purpose by one who, unknown to the world the day before, has since made himself famous in the annals of the world’s iniquitous verdicts by playing at the detective on false scents . But if the originator of this vile invention is not the authoress of “Miss Hildreth,” she is still the first one who has had the impudence of recording it in a novel, adding to it, moreover, a flavour of her own venom . It is, therefore, to her that I address the following refutations . 206  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS 1 . I have never corresponded, whether secretly or openly, with a ‘Monsieur Kinovief;’ nor with the General of this name; nor have I ever been accused before to my knowledge of having done so . 2 .

I take no interest in political intrigues, regarding them as the greatest nuisance and a bore, the falsest of all systems in the code of ethics .

Ten years ago, the Anglo-Indian Government, acting upon a false and malicious insinuation, mistook me for a spy; but after the Police had shadowed me for over eight months—without unearthing a trace of the charge brought against me—it found to its great sorrow that it had made an April-fool of itself . Yet the Anglo-Indian Government acted, after that, in the most honourable way . In November, 1876, Lord Lytton issued an order to the Political Department that Colonel Olcott and myself should be no longer subjected to the insulting surveillance of the Anglo-Indian Police . [Vide the Allahabad Pioneer , November 11, 1879 . ] From that day we were no longer annoyed . 4 . Prince Doudaroff Korsakoff stands probably as the cunning anagram of Prince Dondoukof Korsakof?

Let the Press inquire, from themselves or their Secretaries, whether it has been ever proven by any of their respective Governments that I was a political agent, whatever may be the malicious society gossip of my enemies .

That which we believed yesterday, we no longer believe today; and in both instances merely because the wind was blowing from a different direction .

Our European scholars of the Middle 212  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Ages considered the Hindu allegory representing our Earth as resting upon four elephants s tanding on a turtle, wagging its short tail in empty universal space—as a sacred truth . Now they have become convinced that the earth is round, and that our planet is an insignificant little globe among billions of other and bigger planets . People used to think of themselves as Gods of this Earth, for whom the Cosmos had been created; but now science has convinced us that we are nothing more than the progeny of tailless monkeys, and are, together with these our wretched cousins , descendants of one and the same (however, as yet undiscovered) forefather—Adam with a tail . Long ago? Well, it was only yesterday that according to the authoritative teaching of Haeckel and of his friend Huxley, there sat at the very root of the genealogical tree of humanity the Moneron , hermit of the Ocean, a jelly-like blob considered by Darwinists as the Alpha of all flesh living on earth, and the Omega of which is man himself . This bit of jelly fished out of the depths of the sea by Huxley, was named in honor of his German colleague Bathybius Haeckalii , and Darwinists praised themselves profusely for their great discovery . “ Eureka !

Explanation is the Soul of Science . They will tell you we cannot have their knowledge without living their life . . . . Public experimental research, the printing press, and a free-thought platform, have abolished the need of mystery . It is no longer necessary for science to take the veil, as she was forced to do for security in times past,” etc . This is a very mistaken view in one aspect . “Secrets of the purer and profounder life” not only may but must be made universally known . But there are secrets that kill in the arcana of Occultism, and unless a man lives the life he cannot be entrusted with them . The late Professor Faraday had very serious doubts whether it was quite wise and reasonable to give out to the public at large certain discoveries of modern science . Chemistry had led to the invention of too terrible means of destruction in our century to allow it to fall into the hands of the profane . What man of sense—in the face of such fiendish applications of dynamite and other explosive substances as are made by those incarnations of the Destroying Power, who glory in calling themselves Anarchists and Socialists—would not agree with us in saying : —Far better for mankind that it should never have blasted a rock by modern 216  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS perfected means, than that it should have shattered the limbs of one per cent . even of those who have been thus destroyed by the pitiless hand of Russian Nihilists, Irish Fenians and Anarchists .

England alone — the centre of civilization — has 21,268 firms fabricating and selling explosive substances . * But the centres of the dynamite trade, of infernal machines, and other such results of modern civilization, are chiefly at Philadelphia and New York . It is in the former city of “Brotherly Love” that the now most famous manufacturer of explosives flourishes . It is one of the well-known respectable citizens—the inventor and manufacturer of the most murderous “dynamite toys”—who, called before the Senate of the United States anxious to adopt means for the repression of a too free trade in such implements, found an argument that ought to become immortalised for its cynical sophistry : —“My machines ,” that expert is reported to have said—“are quite harmless to look at ; as they may be manufactured in the shape of oranges, hats, boats, and anything one likes . . . . Criminal is he who murders people by means of such machines, not he who manufactures them .

As found in the Report of the Commission appointed to investigate the variety and character of the so-called “infernal machines,” so far the following implements of instantaneous human destruction are already on hand . The most fashionable of all among the many varieties fabricated by Mr . Holgate, are the “Ticker,” the “Eight Day Machine,” the “Little Exterminator,” and the “Bottle Machines . ” The “Ticker” is in appearance like a piece of lead, a foot long and four inches thick . It contains an iron or steel tube, full of a kind of gunpowder invented by Holgate himself . That gunpowder, in appearance like any other common stuff of that name, has, however, an explosive power two hundred times stronger than common gunpowder; the “Ticker” containing thus a powder which equals in force two hundred pounds of the common gunpowder . At one end of the machine is fastened an invisible clock-work meant to regulate the time of the explosion, which time may be fixed from one minute to thirty-six hours . The spark is produced by means of a steel needle which gives a spark at the touch-hole, and communicates thereby the fire to the whole machine ."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The “Eight Day Machine” is considered the most powerful, but at the same time the most complicated, of all those invented . One must be familiar with handling it before a full success can be secured . It is owing to this difficulty that the terrible fate intended for London Bridge and its neighbourhood was turned aside by the instantaneous killing instead of the two Fenian criminals . The size and appearance of that machine changes, Proteus-like, according to the necessity of smuggling it in, in one or another way, unperceived by the victims . It may be concealed in bread, in a basket of oranges, in a liquid, and so on . The Commission of Experts is said to have declared that its explosive power is such as to reduce to atoms instantly the largest edifice in the world . The “Little Exterminator” is an innocent-looking plain utensil having the shape of a modest jug . It contains neither dynamite nor powder, but secretes, nevertheless, a deadly gas, and has a hardly perceptible clock-work attached to its 218  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS edge, the needle of which points to the time when that gas will effect its escape . In a shut-up room this new “vril” of lethal kind, will smother to death , nearly instantaneously , every living being within a distance of a hundred feet, the radius of the murderous jug . With these three “latest novelties” in the high season of Christian civilization, the catalogue of the dynamiters is closed; all the rest belongs to the old “fashion” of the past years . It consists of hats, porte cigars , bottles of ordinary kind, and even ladies ’ smelling bottles , filled with dynamite, nitro-glycerine, etc . , etc . ,—weapons, some of which, following unconsciously Karmic law, killed many of the dynamiters in the last Chicago revolution . Add to this the forthcoming long-promised Keely’s vibratory force, capable of reducing in a few seconds a dead bullock to a heap of ashes, and then ask yourself if the Inferno of Dante as a locality can ever rival earth in the production of more hellish engines of destruction! Thus, if purely material implements are capable of blowing up, from a few corners, the greatest cities of the globe, provided the murderous weapons are guided by expert hands—what terrible dangers might not arise from magical occult secrets being revealed, and allowed to fall into the possession of ill-meaning persons! A thousand times more dangerous and lethal are these, because neither the criminal hand, nor the immaterial , invisible weapon used, can ever be detected . The congenital black magicians—those who, to an innate propensity towards evil, unite highly-developed mediumistic natures—are but too numerous in our age . It is high time then that psychologists and believers, at least, should cease advocating the beauties of publicity and claiming knowledge of the secrets of nature for all .

They “never existed before the Christian era,” it was said; “they were all written with the triple object of speculation, deceit and pious fraud”; they were all, the best of them, silly apocrypha . In this respect, the nineteenth century proved a most worthy progeny of the eighteenth . For in the age of Voltaire, as well as in this, everything that did not emanate direct from the Royal Academy was false, superstitious and foolish, and belief in the wisdom of the Ancients was laughed to scorn, perhaps more even than it is now . The very thought of accepting as authentic the works and vagaries of a false Hermes, a false Orpheus, a false Zoroaster, of false Oracles, false Sibyls, and a thrice false Mesmer and his absurd “fluids,” was tabooed all along the line . Thus all that had T HE D ENIALS AND M ISTAKES  225 i ts genesis outside the learned and dogmatic precincts of Oxford and Cambridge, or the Academy of France, was denounced in those days as “unscientific” and “ridiculously absurd . ” This tendency has survived to the present day . We think we see the sidereal phantom of the old philosopher and mystic, Henry More, once of Cambridge University, moving about in the astral mist, over the old moss-covered roofs of the ancient town from which he wrote his famous letter to Glanvill about “witches . ” The soul seems restless and indignant, as on that day May 5th, 1678, when the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Doctor complained so bitterly to the author of Sadducismus Triumphatus of Scot, Adie and Webster . “Our new inspired Saints,” the soul is heard to mutter, “sworn advocates of the witches who thus madly and boldly, against all sense and reason, against all antiquity, against all interpreters, and against the inspired Scripture itself, will have no Samuel in this scene, but a cunning confederate knave; whether the inspired Scripture, or these in-blown buffoons, puffed up with nothing but ignorance, vanity, and stupid infidelity, are to be believed, let anyone judge . ”* Rest in peace, O restless soul . Lately things are somewhat changed; and since that for ever memorable day when the Academical Committee (Franklin included) investigated Mesmer’s phenomena and proclaimed them a clever knavery, every hour brings in some fresh evidence in favour of Mesmerism and phenomena in general .

Renan—has to say of poor humanity and its powers of discernment . “Mankind,” he believes, “has but a very narrow mind; and the number of men capable of seizing acutely ( finement ) the true analogy of things is quite imperceptible” ( Études Religieuses ) . Upon comparing, however, this statement with another opinion expressed by the same author, namely, that “the mind of the true critic should yield, hands and feet bound, to facts, to be dragged by them wherever they may lead him” ( Études Historiques ),* one feels relieved . When, moreover, these two philosophical statements are strengthened by that third enunciation of the famous Academician, who declares that “tout parti pris a priori doit ē tre banni de la science,” there remains little to fe ar . Unfortunately M . Renan is the first to break the golden rule . The evidence of Herodotus, called, sarcastically no doubt, “the father of history,” since in every question upon which modern thought disagrees with him his testimony goes for nought; the sober and earnest assurances in the philosophical narratives of Plato and Thucydides, Polybius and Plutarch, and even certain statements of Aristotle himself; all these are invariably laid aside whenever they are involved with what modern criticism is pleased to regard as a myth . It is some time since Strauss proclaimed that “the presence of a supernatural element or miracle in a narrative is an infallible sign of the presence in it of"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"a myth ,” and such is the criterion adopted tacitly by every modern critic . But what is a myth— \u000e Ø θος —to begin with? Are we not told distinctly by the anc ient classics that mythus is equivalent to the word tradition ?

Renan in France, and most of the English and German Orientalists, there may be no end of surprises in store for us in the century to come—historical, geographical, ethnological and philological surprises—travesties in philosophy having become so common of late that we can be startled by nothing in that direction . We have already been told by one learned speculator that Homer was “simply a mythical personification of the Épopée,”* by another that Hippocrates, son of Esculapius, “ could only be a chimera ,” that the Asclepiadae—their seven hundred years of duration notwithstanding—“might after all prove simply a fiction ”; that the city of Troy—Dr . Schliemann notwithstanding—“existed only on the maps,” etc . , etc . Why should we not be invited after this to regard every hitherto historical character in days of old as a myth? Were not Alexander the Great needed by philology as a sledge-hammer to break the heads of Br ā hmanical chronological pretensions, he would have be c ome long ago simply a symbol for annexation, or a genius of Conquest, as de Mirville neatly put it . Blank denial is the only means left, the most secure refuge and asylum, to shelter for some little time to come the last of the sceptics . When one denies unconditionally it becomes unnecessary to go to the trouble of arguing, and, what is worse, of having to yield occasionally a point or two before the irrefutable arguments and facts of one’s opponent . Creuzer, greatest of the symbologists of his time, the most learned among the masses of erudite German mythologists, must have envied the placid self-confidence of certain sceptics, when he found himself forced in a moment of desperate perplexity to admit, “decidedly and first of all we are compelled to return to the theories of trolls and genii, as they were understood by the ancients, a doctrine without which ——————— * L .

Their sanctity of life and great learning—the latter passing to posterity—made the name for long ages a synonym of Science .

Meanwhile, the “rhombs of Hecate” and the “wheels of Lucifer,”† daily exhumed on the site of Babylon, can no longer be used as a clear evidence of Satan-worship, since the same symbols are shown in the ritual of the Latin Church .

(see Egypt ’ s place , etc . , I, 97), suddenly becomes a Pseudo-Manetho, as soon as the ideas propounded by him clash with the scientific prejudices against magic and the occult knowledge claimed by the ancient priests . However, none of the archæologists doubts for a moment the almost incredible antiquity of the Hermetic books . Champollion shows the greatest regard for their authenticity and great truthfulness, corroborated as it is by many of the oldest monuments . And Bunsen brings irrefutable proofs of their age . From his researches, for instance, we learn that there was a line of sixty-one kings before the days of Moses, who preceded the Mosaic period by a clearly-traceable civilization of several thousand years . Thus we are warranted in believing that the works of Hermes Trismegistus were extant many ages before the birth of the Jewish law-giver . “Styli and inkstands were found on monuments of the fourth Dynasty, the oldest in the world,” says Bunsen . If the eminent Egyptologist rejects the period of 48,863 years before Alexander, to which Diogenes Laertius [ Lives , “Proemium,” Book I, ch . i, § 2] carries back the records of the priests, he is evidently more embarrassed with his mention of their 373 eclipses (local and total or nearly so) of the sun, and 832 of the moon, and remarks that “if they were actual observations, they must have extended over 10,000 years” (Bunsen, op . cit . , I, 14) . “We learn, however,” he adds, “from one of their own chronological works . . . . that the genuine Egyptian traditions concerning the mythological period, treated of myriads of years” ( ibid . , p . 15) .

Finally Creuzer discovered and pointed out the numerous passages borrowed from Orphic hymns by Hesiod and Homer; and Christians appealed, in their turn, to the testimony of Aeschylus, as showing “prescience in at least one of the Sibyls of old,” says de Mirville . † Thus gradually the ancient claims came to be vindicated, and modern criticism had to submit to evidence .

Cicero declares that Pherecydes is potius divinus quam physicus , “rather a soothsayer than a physicist”;* and Diogenes Laertius gives a vast number of stories relating to his predictions .

Yet it gives offence to the many, and makes Theosophists hateful . “Judge not, if thou wilt not be judged” [ Matt . vii, 1-2], is the habitual warning . It is precisely because Theosophists would themselves be judged and court impartial criticism, that they begin by rendering that service to their fellow-men .

The Bible is full of wholesome advice, yet few are the Christians who have ever applied any of its ethical injunctions to their daily lives .

It is the beneficent goad which stimulates to life and action—hence to healthy changes—the heavy ruminants called Routine and Prejudice, in private as in social life . Adverse opinions are like conflicting winds which brush from the quiet surface of a lake the green scum that tends to settle upon still waters .

Thus, whenever taken to task for disrespect to Science and its “authorities,” which the Unpopular Philosopher is accused of rejecting, he demurs to the statement .

Science is like a railway train which carries its baggage van from one terminus to the other, and with which no one except the railway officials may interfere . But passengers who travel by the same train can hardly be prevented from quitting the direct line at fixed stations, to proceed, if they so like, by diverging roads . They should have this option, 246  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS without being taxed with libelling the chief line . To proceed beyond the terminus on horseback, cart or foot, or even to undertake pioneer work, by cutting entirely new paths through the great virgin forests and thickets of public ignorance, is their undoubted prerogative . Other explorers are sure to follow; nor less sure are they to criticize the newly-cut pathway . They will thus do more good than harm . For truth, according to an old Belgian proverb, is always the result of conflicting opinions, like the spark that flies out from the shock of two flints struck together . Why should men of learning be always so inclined to regard Science as their own personal property? Is knowledge a kind of indivisible family estate, entailed only on the elder sons of Science? Truth belongs to all, or ought so to belong; excepting always those few special branches of knowledge which should be preserved ever secret, like those two-edged weapons that both kill and save . Some philosopher compared knowledge to a ladder, the top of which was more easily reached by a man unencumbered by heavy luggage, than by him who has to drag along an enormous bale of old conventionalities, faded out and dried . Moreover, such a one must look back every moment, for fear of losing some of his fossils . Is it owing to such extra weight that so few of them ever reach the summit of the ladder, and that they affirm there is nothing beyond the highest rung they have reached? Or is it for the sake of preserving the old dried-up plants of the Past that they deny the very possibility of any fresh, living blossoms, on new forms of life, in the Future? Whatever their answer, without such optimistic hope in the ever-becoming, life would be little worth living . What between “authorities,” their fear of, and wrath at the slightest criticism—each and all of them demanding to be regarded as infallible in their respective departments—the world threatens to fossilize in its old prejudices and routine . Fogeyism grins its skeleton-like sneer at every innovation or new form of thought .

Many were the remains in it of our forefathers’ hospitable way of living; and many the medieval customs preserved, founded on traditions and superstitions, semi-Finnish and semi-Russian, the latter imported into it by its female proprietors from the shores of the Neva . Christmas trees were being prepared and implements for divination were being made ready . For, in that old castle there were grim worm-eaten portraits of famous ancestors and knights and ladies, old deserted turrets, with bastions and Gothic windows; mysterious somber alleys, and dark and endless cellars, easily transformed into subterranean passages and caves, ghostly prison cells, haunted by the restless phantoms of the heroes of local legends . In short, the old Manor offered every commodity for romantic horrors . But alas! this once they serve for nought; in the present narrative these dear old horrors play no such part as they otherwise might . Its chief hero is a very commonplace, prosaical man—let us call him Erkler . Yes; Dr . Erkler, professor of medicine, half-German through his father, a full-blown Russian on his mother’s side and by education; and one who looked a rather heavily built, and ordinary mortal . Nevertheless, very extraordinary things happened with him . Erkler, as it turned out was a great traveler, who by his own choice had accompanied one of the most famous explorers on his journeys round the world . More than once F ROM THE P OLAR L ANDS  249 t hey had both seen death face to face from sunstrokes under the Tropics, from cold in the Polar Regions . All this notwithstanding, the doctor spoke with a never-abating enthusiasm about their “winterings” in Greenland and Novaya Zemla, and about the desert plains in Australia, where he lunched off a kangaroo and dined off an emu, and almost perished of thirst during the passage through a waterless track, which it took them forty hours to cross . “Yes,” he used to remark, “I have experienced almost everything, save what you would describe as supernatural . . . . This, of course if we throw out of account a certain"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"extraordinary event in my life—a man I met, of whom I will tell you just now—and its . . . indeed, rather strange, I may add quite inexplicable , results . ” There was a loud demand that he should explain himself; and the doctor, forced to yield, began his narrative . “In 1878 we were compelled to winter on the northwestern coast of Spitzbergen . We had been attempting to find our way during the short summer to the pole; but as usual, the attempt had proved a failure, owing to the icebergs, and, after several such fruitless endeavors, we had to give it up . No sooner had we settled than the polar night descended upon us, our steamers got wedged in and frozen between the blocks of ice in the Gulf of Mussel, and we found ourselves cut off for eight long months from the rest of the living world. . . . I confess I, for one, felt it terribly at first . We became especially discouraged when one stormy night the snow hurricane scattered a mass of materials prepared for our winter buildings, and deprived us of over forty deer from our herd . Starvation in prospect is no incentive to good humor; and with the deer we had lost the best plat de résistance against polar frosts, human organisms demanding in that climate an increase of heating and solid food . However, we were finally reconciled to our loss, and even got accustomed to the local and in reality more nutritious food—seals, and seal-grease . Our men from the remnants of our lumber built a house neatly divided into two compartments, one for three professors and myself, and the other for themselves; and, a few wooden sheds being 250  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS constructed for meteorological, astronomical and magnetic purposes, we even added a p rotecting stable for the few remaining deer . And then began the monotonous series of dawnless nights and days, hardly distinguishable one from the other, except through dark-gray shadows . At times, the “blues” we got into were fearful! We had contemplated sending two of our three steamers home in September, but the premature and unforseen formation of ice walls round them had thwarted our plans; and now, with the entire crews on our hands, we had to economize still more with our meager provisions, fuel and light . Lamps were used only for scientific purposes : the rest of the time we had to content ourselves with God’s light—the moon and the Aurora Borealis . . . . But how describe these glorious, incomparable northern lights! Rings, arrows, gigantic conflagrations of accurately divided rays of the most vivid and varied colors . The November moonlight nights were as gorgeous . The play of moonbeams on the snow and the frozen rocks was most striking . These were fairy nights . “Well, one such night—it may have been one such day , for all I know, as from the end of November to about the middle of March we had no twilights at all, to distinguish the one from the other—we suddenly espied in the play of colored beams, which were then throwing a golden rosy hue on the snow plains, a dark moving spot . . . . It grew, and seemed to scatter as it approached nearer to us . What did this mean? . . . It looked like a herd of cattle, or a group of living men, trotting over the snowy wilderness . . . . But animals there were white like everything else . What then was this? . . . human beings? . . ."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"“We could not believe our eyes . Yes, a group of men was approaching our dwelling . It turned out to be about fifty seal-hunters, guided by Matiliss, a well-known veteran mariner, from Norway . They had been caught by the icebergs, just as we had been . “‘How did you know that we were here?’ we asked . “‘Old Johan, this very same old party, showed us the way’—they answered, pointing to a venerable-looking old man with snow-white locks . F ROM THE P OLAR L ANDS   251 “ In sober truth, it would have beseemed their guide far better to have sat at home over his fire than to have been seal-hunting in polar lands with younger men . And we told them so, still wondering how he came to learn of our presence in this kingdom of white bears . At this Matiliss and his companions smiled, assuring us that ‘old Johan’ knew all . They remarked that we must be novices in polar borderlands, since we were ignorant of Johan’s personality and could still wonder at anything said of him . “‘It is nigh forty-five years,’ said the chief hunter, ‘that I have been catching seals in the Polar Seas, and as far as my personal remembrance goes, I have always known him, and just as he is now, an old, white-bearded man . And so far back as in the days when I used to go to sea, as a small boy with my father, my dad used to tell me the same of old Johan, and he added that his own father and grandfather too, had known Johan in their days of boyhood, none of them having ever seen him otherwise than white as our snows . And, as our forefathers nicknamed him “the white-haired all-knower,” thus do we, the seal hunters, call him, to this day . ’ “‘Would you make us believe he is two hundred years old?’—we laughed . “Some of our sailors crowding round the white-haired phenomenon, plied him with questions . “‘Grandfather! answer us, how old are you?’ “‘I really do not know it myself, sonnies .

XVIII, No . 107, July, 1896, pp . 361-367] Works by specialists and scholars have to be treated with a certain respect, due to s cience . But such works as Payne Knight’s A Discourse on the Worship of Priapus , and the Ancient Faiths , etc . , of Dr . Inman, were merely the precursory drops of the shower of phallicism that burst upon the reading public in the shape of Major-General Forlong’s Rivers of Life . Very soon lay writers followed the torrent, and Hargrave Jennings’ charming volume, The Rosicrucians , was superseded by his Phallicism . As an elaborate account of this work—that hunts up sexual worship, from the grossest forms of idolatry up to its most refined and hidden symbolism in Christianity—would better suit a newspaper review than a journal like the present, it becomes necessary to state at once the reason it is noticed at all . Were Theosophists entirely to ignore it, Phallicism* and such-like works would be used some day against Theosophy . Mr . Hargrave Jennings’ last production was written, in every probability, to arrest its progress—erroneously confounded as it is by many with Occultism, pure and simple, and even with Buddhism itself . Phallicism appeared in 1884, just at a time when all the French and English papers heralded the arrival of a few Theosophists from India as the advent of Buddhism in Christian Europe ——————— * Phallicism , Celestial and Terrestrial , Heathen and Christian ; its connection with the Rosicrucians and the Gnostics and its foundation in Buddhism , Geo .

Whether rightly or wrongly, public rumour attributes this “mystic” production of Mr . Hargrave Jennings’ to the advent of Theosophy . However it may be, and whosoever may have inspired the author, his efforts"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"were crowned with success only in one direction Notwithstanding that he proclaims himself, modestly enough, “the first introducer, as the grand philosophical problem, of the vast religious and national importance of Buddhism,”* and pronounces his work “undoubtedly new and perfectly original,” declaring in the same breath that all the “previous great men and the long line of profound thinkers [before himself] labouring through the ages [in this direction] have worked in vain,” it is easy to prove the author mistaken . His “enthusiasm” and self-laudation may be very sincere, and no doubt his labours were “enormous,” as he says; they have nevertheless led him on an entirely false track, when he asserts that : “These mighty physiological disputes [about the mysteries of animal generation] induced in the reflective wisdom of the earliest thinkers, laid the sublime foundations of the Phallic Worship . They led to violent schisms in religion . . . ” Now it is precisely Buddhism which was the first religious system in history that sprang up with the determinate object of putting an end to all the male Gods and to the degrading idea of a sexual personal Deity being the generator of mankind and the Father of men . His book, the author assures us “comprises, within the limit of a modest octavo, all that can be known . . . . of the doctrines of the Buddhists, Gnostics, and Rosicrucians, as connected with Phallicism” . In this he errs again, and most profoundly, or—which would be still worse—he is trying to mislead the reader by filling him with disgust for such “mysteries.” His work is ——————— * Ibid . , p . xiii . ——————— 2 56  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS “new and original” in so far as it explains with enthusiastic and reverential approval the s trong phallic element in the Bible ; for, as he says, “Jehovah undoubtedly signifies the Universal Male,” and he calls Mary Magdalen before her conversion the “female St . Michael,” as a mystical antithesis and paradox . No one, truly, in Christian countries before him has ever had the moral courage to speak so openly as he does of the phallic element with which the Christian Church (the Roman Catholic) is honeycombed, and this is the author’s chief desert and credit . But all the merit of the boasted “conciseness and brevity” of his “modest octavo” disappears on its becoming the undeniable and evident means of leading the reader astray under the most false impressions; especially as very few, if any, of his readers will follow or even share his “enthusiasm . . . . converted out of the utmost original disbelief of these wondrously stimulating and beautiful Phallic beliefs . ” Nor is it fair or honest to give out a portion of the truth, without allowing any room for a palliative, as is done in the cases of Buddha and Christ . That which the former did in India, Jesus repeated in Palestine . Buddhism was a passionate reactionary protest against the phallic worship that led every nation first to the adoration of a personal God, and finally to black"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"magic, and the same object was aimed at by the Nazarene Initiate and prophet . Buddhism escaped the curse of black magic by keeping clear of a personal male God in its religious system; but this conception reigning supreme in the so-called monotheistic countries, black magic—the fiercer and stronger for being utterly disbelieved in by its most ardent votaries, unconscious perhaps of its presence among them—is drawing them nearer and nearer to the maëlstrom of every nation given to sin, or to sorcery, pure and simple . No Occultist believes in the devil of the Church, the traditional Satan; every student of Occultism and every Theosophist believes in black magic, and in dark, natural powers present in the worlds, if he accept the white or divine science as an actual fact on our globe . Therefore one may repeat in full confidence the remark made by Cardinal Ventura on the devil—only applying it to black magic . B UDDHISM , C HRISTIANITY AND P HALLICISM  257 “ The greatest victory of Satan was gained on that day when he succeeded in making himself denied . ” It may be said further, that “Black magic reigns over Europe as an all-powerful, though unrecognized, autocrat,” its chief conscious adherents and practical servants being found in the Roman Church, and its unconscious practitioners in the Protestant . The whole body of the so-called “privileged” classes of society in Europe and America is honeycombed with unconscious black magic, or sorcery of the vilest character . But Christ is not responsible for the mediaeval and the modern Christianity fabricated in His name . And if the author of Phallicism be right in speaking of the transcendental sexual worship in Roman Church and calling it “true, although doubtless it will prove to be profound, mystical, strictly ‘Christian’ paradoxical construction,” he is wrong in calling it the “celestial or Theosophical doctrine of the unsexual, transcendental phallicism,” for all such words strung together become meaningless by annulling each other . “Paradoxical” indeed must be that “construction” which seeks to show the phallic element in “the tomb of the Redeemer,” and the yonic in Nirv ∼ na, besides finding a Priapus in the “Word made Flesh” or the L OGOS . But such is the “Priapomania” of our century that even the most a rdent professed Christians have to admit the element of phallicism in their dogmas, lest they should be twitted with it by their opponents . This is not meant as criticism, but simply as the defence of real, true magic, confined by the author of Phallicism to the “divine magic of generation . ” “Phallic ideas,” he says, are “discovered to be the foundation of all religions . ” In this there is nothing “new” or “original . ” Since state religions came into existence, there was never an Initiate or philosopher, a Master or disciple, who was ignorant of it . Nor is there any fresh discovery in the fact of Jehovah having been worshipped by the Jews under the shape of “phallic stones” (unhewn)—of being, in short, as much of a phallic God as any other Lingam, which fact has been no mystery from the days of Dupuis .

Ralston Skinner of Cincinnati, in his wonderfully clever and erudite volume, The Source of Measures , * published some years ago, in which he demonstrates the fact on mathematical grounds, completely versed, as he seems to be, in kabalistic numerical calculations . What then makes the author of Phallicism say that in his book will be found “a more complete and more connected account than has hitherto appeared of the different forms of the . . . peculiar veneration (not idolatry), generally denominated the Phallic worship”? “No previous writer has disserted so fully,” he adds with modest reserve, “upon the shades and varieties of this singular ritual, or traced up so completely its mysterious blendings with the ideas of the philosophers, as to what lies remotely in Nature in regard to the origin and history of the human race . ” There is one thing really “original” and “new” in Phallicism , and it is this : while noticing and underlining the most filthy rites connected with phallic worship among every “heathen” nation, those of the Christians are idealized, and a veil of a most mystic fabric is thrown over them . At the same time the author accepts and insists upon Biblical chronology . Thus he assigns to the Chaldaean Tower of Babel—“that magnificent, monster ‘Upright,’ defiant” phallus, as he puts it—an age “soon after the Flood”; and to the Pyramids “a date not long after the foundation of the Egyptian monarchy by Misraim, the son of Ham, 2188 B . C . ” The chronological views of the author of The Rosicrucians seem to h ave greatly changed of late . There is a mystery about his book, difficult, yet not wholly impossible to fathom, which may be summed up in the words of the Comte de Gasparin with regard to the works on Satan by the Marquis de Mirville : “Everything goes to show a work which is essentially an act, and has the value of a collective labour . ” But this is of no moment to the Theosophists . That which is of real importance is his misleading statement, which he ——————— * [ See Key to the Hebrew Egyptian Mystery in the Source of Measures (1875); reprint by Wizard’s Bookshelf, San Diego, 1975— Compiler . ] ——————— B UDDHISM , C HRISTIANITY AND P HALLICISM  259 s upports on Wilford’s authority, that the legendary war that began in India and spread all over the globe was caused by a diversity of opinion upon the relative “superiority of the male or female emblem . . . in regard of the idolatrous magic worship . . . .

This magic or sorcery is based upon, springs from, and has the very life and soul of selfish impulse; and thus was gradually developed the idea of a personal God . The first “pillar of unhewn stone,” the first objective “ sign and witness to the Lord,” creative, generative, and the “Father of man,” was made to become the archetype and progenitor of the long series of male (vertical) and female (horizontal) Deities, of pillars, and cones . Anthropomorphism in religion is the direct generator of and stimulus to the exercise of black, left-hand magic . And it was again merely a feeling of selfish national exclusiveness—not even patriotism—of pride and self-glorification over all other nations, that could lead an Isaiah to see a difference between the one living God and the idols of the neighbouring nations .

How many of our distinguished scientists have derived honour and credit by merely dressing up the ideas of those old philosophers, whom they are ever ready to disparage, is left to an impartial posterity to say . But conceit and self-opinionatedness have fastened like two hideous cancers on the brains of the average man of learning; and this is especially the case with the Orientalists-Sanskritists, Egyptologists and Assyriologists . The former are guided (or perhaps only pretend to be guided) by post Mah ā bh ā ratian commentators; the latter by ar bitrarily interpreted papyri, collated with what this or the other Greek writer said, or passed over in silence, and by the cuneiform inscriptions T HE M IND IN N ATURE   263 o n half-destroyed clay tablets copied by the Assyrians from “Accado-” Babylonian records . Too many of them are apt to forget, at every convenient opportunity, that the numerous changes in language, the allegorical phraseology and evident secretiveness of old mystic writers, who were generally under the obligation never to divulge the solemn secrets of the sanctuary, might have sadly misled both translators and commentators .

But this is on a par with that other illusion of some Sanskritists, who, though they have never even been in India, claim to know Sanskrit accent and pronunciation, as also the meaning of the Vaidic allegories, far better than the most learned among the great Br ā hmanical pundits and Sanskrit scholars of India . — — ————— * See the H ibbert Lectures for 1887, pages 14-17, on the origin and growth of the religion of the ancient Babylonians, where Prof .

Gladstone, and so stale in its monotony to most, which consists in perceiving in every symbol of the religions of old a solar myth, dragged down, whenever opportunity requires, to a sexual or phallic emblem . Hence the statement that while “Gisdhubar was but a champion and conqueror of old times,” for the Orientalists, who “can penetrate beneath the myths” he is but a solar hero, “who was himself but the transformed descendant of a humbler God of Fire,” ( loc . cit . , p . 17) . ——————— 2 64  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS After this who can wonder that the jargon and blinds of our mediaeval alchemists and K abalists are also read literally by the modern student; that the Greek and even the ideas of Aeschylus are corrected and improved upon by the Cambridge and Oxford Greek Scholars, and that the veiled parables of Plato are attributed to his “ignorance . ” Yet, if the students of the dead languages know anything, they ought to know that the method of extreme necessitarianism was practiced in ancient as well as in modern philosophy; that from the first ages of man, the fundamental truths of all that we are permitted to know on earth were in the safe keeping of the Adepts of the sanctuary; that the difference in creeds and religious practice was only external; and that those guardians of the primitive divine revelation, who had solved every problem that is within the grasp of human intellect, were bound together by a universal freemasonry of science and philosophy, which formed one unbroken chain around the globe . It is for philology and the Orientalists to endeavour to find the end of the thread . But if they will persist in seeking it in one direction only, and that the wrong one, truth and fact will never be discovered . It thus remains the duty of psychology and Theosophy to help the world to arrive at them . Study the Eastern religions by the light of Eastern—not Western—philosophy, and if you happen to relax correctly one single loop of the old religious systems, the chain of mystery may be disentangled .

The true philosophical meaning of the legends and allegories on the sacred serpent, is now almost entirely lost .

It is argued that there cannot be more than one object of perception at a time before the soul because soul is a unit . Occultism teaches that simultaneously our conscious[ness] could receive no less than seven distinct impressions, and even pass them into memory . This can be proved by striking at the same time seven keys of the scale of an instrument—say a piano . The 7 sounds will reach consciousness simultaneously; though the untrained consciousness may not be capable of registering them the first second, their prolonged vibrations will strike the ear in 7 distinct sounds one higher than the other in its pitch . All depends on training and attention . Thus the transference of a sensation from any organ to consciousness is almost instantaneous if your attention is fixed upon it; but if any noise distracts your attention it will take a number of seconds before it reaches consciousness . The Occultist should train himself to receive and transmit along the line of the seven scales of his consciousness every impression or impressions simultaneously . He who reduces the intervals of physical time the most, has made the most progress . The names and order of the 7 scales are . 1 . Sense-perception; 2 . Self-perception (or apperception) 3 .

A delicate sense of touch and acute hearing are required in the observer for the proper adjustment of the pantophonograph .

Members of the Committee, who may have given little attention to astrognosical science, may properly be informed that, unless it is accurately known under what constellation the subject of an inquiry was born, so that it, or at least the stars that lay in its cyclic path and were thus brought into the influence of his current, may be caught in the focus of the etheric reflector, much time must be spent in searching for him in that quarter of the heavens where the general reflections of his epoch are travelling . While this principle of catoptrics was, of course, always known to occultists, physical science was ignorant of it until the comparative late epoch of the last quarter of the nineteenth century . At that time a conception of the truth appears to have dawned upon the minds of several observers almost simultaneously . For example, a professor of geognosy—termed geology, doubtless because they discoursed more about the earth than knew anything about it—a certain E . Hitchcock, ventured an opinion that possibly the scenes transpiring upon the earth may be imprinted “upon the world around us,” and added that it was not impossible “that there are tests by which nature . . . can bring out and fix those portraits, as on a great canvas, spread over the material universe . Perhaps , too, they may never fade from that canvas, but become specimens in the great picture gallery of eternity . ” This feeble, tentative prognosis should not cause a smile, for when we consider the darkness of psychological perceptions in that period, this must be regarded as almost an instance of psychic prevision .

But since he has obtained for all the rare privilege of treating the Christian religion with at least as much impartiality as is shown by the Europeans in the treatment of other people’s religions, we do no more than avail ourselves of our right . And, it will be no fault of ours, if we are unable to avoid conflict with deep-rooted prejudices and convictions of partisan sectarianism, for—we seek it not . Ours is but the duty of analyzing and examining all creeds alike impartially . Neither is it our intention to handle roughly that which Professor W . Wordsworth so opulently styles “the golden kernel of the Galilean teaching . ” In our unceasing search for truth we simply gather in every available information capable of throwing light upon the dark nooks and corners of the various faiths of humanity, and store in as much material for comparison as we can . Out of the gigantic heap of pagan Symbols, we mean to choose for this publication none but those which P AGAN S YMBOLISM I NDESTRUCTIBLE —W HY ?  297 a re liable to throw the light we are so much in need of . Desiring to fathom all things, and above all—that which seems most inherent to the heart of men, and with which he parts the most reluctantly—Religion, we necessarily have to turn to the symbols which have been found—at least partially—the keys to every faith . Many of them we find alive now, as in the days of old, and notwithstanding the fanatical persecution of the youngest of the world’s religions, having passed part and parcel in the Christian creeds . But of them we will discuss later on . Our object now is to analyze that feeling which, surviving common sense and reason, makes people cling to the so-called “superstitions” of"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"long vanished generations of their forefathers . In relation to this symbolism of ancient pagan thought, a curious psycho-physiological phenomenon may partially account for it . We have often thought that the degree of genius exhibited in works of fiction by the most renowned novelists, largely depended upon and was proportionate to the intensity and interest felt by them in their days of childhood for nursery tales, and it has been also remarked that the older a man becomes, the stronger he clings to and the clearer he seems to see the events of his early childhood . Often to our dying day, we carry in our hearts lingering remembrances of heroes and heroines, the recital of whose deeds had struck our youthful imagination . We may forget acquaintances, and even the images of our dear friends, when separated for long years, may fade away and gradually disappear; the memory of the unfortunate Princess, to whom we vowed all our young sympathy, and her wicked persecutor, the hunch-backed old Fairy, whose malicious frown has often haunted our dreams—can never be obliterated . It is to be observed that in this direction the masses of the uneducated people are no better than children . With their mind but half awake, it often remains unconscious in later years of the emptiness of the fiction . Everything illogical in the tale disappears, perverted images and ideas associated with such arbitrary images alone remain, and even to the majority of more civilized people, Eginhardus’ Charlemagne will never present the same attraction as Carlos Magnus 298  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS and his twelve legendary peers, as found in the Carlovingian Cycle, and the stern image of t he hero will have to make room for the phantastic form of the other, as described by the popular bards and the chivalric romances . While poetical fiction in her gorgeous robes of borrowed plumes finds always an eager audience, sober reality is left a beggar, to take care of itself the best it can . The same with nations and their early faiths . Much as ancient mythology was vilified, perverted, corrupted by the intolerance of early Christianity; however much every trace of it might have been thought obliterated, yet, once that it got hold of the popular imagination it will never die out . The nearest generations of converts may have shunned the faith of their forefathers; those following immediately after will gradually and unconsciously return if not to it—then, at least to many of its most striking symbols and conceptions . Poets will return to them and thus help to revive the popular feeling . And whole nations, like men in their old age, will be often influenced by that lingering, undying feeling of love—aye, veneration sometimes for that which they had worshipped and believed in during their early days—albeit made to laugh at and often curse it in after life . The once mighty gods of the Western nations have departed, but the impression is still there, infused into the very blood of the descendants of those who, for long generations had gradually evolved them out of their own imagination, then developed into living and thinking entities, to finally end by worshipping the children of their own fictions . So true is it, that we can trace this hereditary law with hardly a single exception in the"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"modern divisions of the Roman Catholic, Greek and Protestant nations . The Greeks of the days of Perikles—they who euhemerized a whole pantheon of gods and goddesses, and from whom Phidias had immortalized the Olympian Jupiter and Athaena Promachos—could have no other descendants but those they actually have—the Virgin and Saint worshipping Hellenes . Nor is it less natural to find the Anglo-Saxons and the greatest portion of Germany splitting violently from the image worshipping Roman Catholics, if we have to P AGAN S YMBOLISM I NDESTRUCTIBLE —W HY ?  299 b elieve that which Tacitus said of their forefathers 18 centuries ago, viz . , that “they believe it unworthy the greatness of the gods to confine them within walls, or to represent celestial beings under a human likeness; they consecrate woods and groves as temples : and they apply names of the gods to that mysterious Presence which they behold solely in the spirit of devotion . ”* Thus we may believe that the form of worship depends more on the respective idiosyncrasies of races than on their powers of reasoning; and that the natural sympathies or antipathies of the forefathers will always be reflected more or less in the future generations . The Romans parted with their Jupiter under the condition to worship him under the mask of St . Peter . If they renounced Jove the father of gods, it was but to help him emigrate from Olympus to Eden, with his name—elongated with the help of the Masoretic vowel points, though not transformed beyond all recognition . True, we find him giving birth to Pallas-Athaena in full armour no more, but it is because another mode of procreation has been chosen for him . We can meet him still on sundry windows of French mediaeval cathedrals—proceeding under the garb of a Pope in full canonicals to create Eve out of the rib of sleeping Adam, as shown by Didron . The same for the Greek Zeus . Having renounced to preside at the banquets of the merry old gods, he now rests on clouds surrounded by a choir of philharmonic young cherubs . By some inscrutable means, managing to get out of the boundless and limitless Space, the Eternal has gathered it into a ball representing the Universe, and now we see Him, on numerous icons of the Eastern and Western churches, sitting outside of this Space, but holding it in one of His holy hands under the shape of a globe . So has Athaena of Parthenon, the Virgin Goddess, vanished under the iconoclastic hands of Lachares, who despoiled her of her golden dress weighing 50 talents .

In her turn she made room for the Immaculate Virgin , the last of the Dynasty . This one is also with her Son, one of whose names was Adonai or Lord, as Tammuz was called Adon or Adonis, and who, the same as Mithras, is worshipped as Mediator . With her actual wardrobe of gold, and silver, and of precious jewels, the modern Queen of Heaven may well look in scorn and pity upon the later ancient Athaena . What was the poor chryselephantine statue with its plates of ivory and gold in comparison with the diamond and ruby covered Italian Madonnas and Russian virgins representing a dead capital sufficient to purchase a kingdom! Thus we find again the old truism that it is but names and forms that change—ideas remain the same; and the older a faith, the stronger it clings to the relics of its youth . If it be true of all religions what is said by Prof . Max Müller, who remarks that “if there [is] one thing which a comparative study of religions places in the clearest light, it is the inevitable decay to which every religion is exposed,” then on the other hand, nothing of the kind can ever be said of symbolism .

But if we have the period of the Day of Brahma and if we know that there are seven rounds, that each round covers seven planets, that the period of rest of a planet in every round equals that of its activity, and if to all this knowledge we apply the key of the septenary arithmetical progression series, then we get the numbers as given above. There is a gradual rise of, from one to seven. The duration of the existence of humanity during the Seven Rounds is 1: 2:3:4:5:6:7. In each Round, the duration of the existence of humanity, on the seven planets of our chain is 1: 2:3:4:5:6:7. The period of human existence in seven races, on one planet, is again 1: 2:3:4:5:6:7. Now, as the planet evolves the 7 races in succession, before humanity can pass on to the next planet, the interval between the disappearance of humanity from one planet and its reappearance on the next, is equal to its existence on the planet which it has just left. Take then 4320 millions as the day of Brahma , and calculate according to the above explanation and you will arrive at the above given results. It is noteworthy that in the Hindu exoteric works the period of the Manvantara (One Round) is given at 308 millions, to speak in round numbers. Now two reasons may be assigned for the adoption of that course. In the first place, the duration of the 4th Round according to the above calculations is 617 millions again, to use a round figure. Now, we have already stated that the period of activity of the planetary chain in one round is equal to its period of rest during the same round, while humanity rests in its passage from planet to planet. Thus divide the period of the 4th Round, into two equal parts; and you have 308 millions and odd as the Manvantaric period of our Round. Thus our Round period may have been in the first instance taken as the Manvantaric period. The Second reason may be this. Our planet being the exactly middle period and we being in the middle of the seven rounds, our round period may have been taken to denote the average Manvantaric period, thus at the same time giving a key in a veiled form to the mystery of the geometrical progression We have already stated that the 306  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"above figures are exact, if the exoteric calculations of the Brahmins about the day of Brahma be correct.

When he quotes such sentences as “we nowhere meet in the Buddhist literature, etc . ” (519), he ought to be the first one to perceive that which he does not; namely, that for ages the Vedas as all our sacred literature were deemed too holy to be put in writing and that the act was at one time punished by death . First the initiated Brahmans, more than all the Brahmans in general, had alone the right to “proclaim” or speak out whether the Vedas or the sacred Mantras . . . . Were they open for it we would cite hundreds of \u0001 lokas to that effect . W hen they were put into writing, for a long time, the Brahmans alone had custody over them . Why? Because the whole of the sacred literature is a series of occult treatises; of doctrines and practical teaching of the science of sciences, expressly couched in a conventional language, such sentences generally meaning quite the opposite that they were made to say, and several thousands of words having one exoteric and one esoteric meaning, absurd and repellent when understood in that dead letter, sublime and grand when interpreted with the help of the secret Code . No initiate could or can be one unless he has committed this code to memory . Even when written out in their exoteric language the four Vedas were a forbidden work to the three lower castes .

As if to enforce the more emphatically upon the human mind the everlasting Wisdom of the axiom of the Founder of Astronomy, the Shepherd-god Hermes-A-Brahm—“as above so it is below; as in heaven, so on earth,” hardly yet twelve centuries ago we thought of perceiving that the collective wisdom of our patriarchal teachers had long time since emigrated or rather also moved—West; but never perceived that on its way it had lost as well as the “signs” all semblance of definite forms . In their ignorance, our astronomical predecessors of the Transitional Ages, scoffed at their predecessors, and these in their turn grinned at those who came before . It seems, almost, as if the discovery by Hipparchus the Nicaean, of the retrograde motion of the equinoctial points had a prophetic character in it, as relating to the simultaneously parallel retrogression of human understanding; till finally, and very happily for humanity, the cycle of intellectual Development till then on its downward path, having reached its nadir, suddenly proceeded onward, until it culminated in its highest point of altitude—the present glorious Age! How truly wise and prophetically inspired were the archaic Indo-Chaldees and Egyptians even in giving names to things, may be inferred by one instance just 322  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS recorded from Space, by one of my assistant-stargangers . It is well known to us that at whatever epoch the great Pyramid of Egypt may have been built, it must have been at a time when Draconis, the then Polar Star, was at its lower culmination and the Pleiades—Alcyone especially—were on the same meridian above . By a calculation of Sir John Herschel in A .

Therefore, there now remains no doubt, nor did it remain, long before the means of verifying events by examining their pictorial records in the galleries of Boundless Space were discovered—that the builders of the Pyramid had erected it as an Observatory of Occult Astrognosy, and—called the Polar Star Draco, or Draconis, for reasons, certainly perfectly known to themselves . And yet so retrograding proved the human intellect and so inconsistent with its own reforms that unable to follow their Shepherd forefather’s grand ideas, and yet anxious to prove that they knew as much and far more, they resorted to the following expedients . After having reviled Astrolatry, and trampled under their feet the sacred bulls Apis and Mnevis, symbolizing Life, and worshipped in the days of Menes and in whom the God Pthah, Sokar, Osiris (Life and Light) were allegorically said to be resident, they yet instituted a Pastoral ——————— * Bessel’s calculation . † [ T he Great Pyramid , observatory , tomb and temple , London, Chatto & Windus, 1883 .

They allowed all the heathen names of Stars named by their idolatrous forefathers to remain status quo , and, at the same time, perverted their meanings in the most cunning way . So, having erroneously and most ridiculously calculated that less than a fourth of the great astronomical cycle formed by the precedence in the equinoctial presentation has passed since MAN WAS PLACED UPON THE EARTH ; they set themselves to m aking prophecies on quite an opposite basis . So, for instance, one of such Pastors or Shepherds at the head of a hydropathic sect named “Baptists,” in an old and now ruined city of the Atlantidian continent, called Philadelphia (probably a Greek colony, peopled by irresolute and ever trembling people called Quakers) took upon himself to interpret the presence of Draconis, the chief Star situated in the tail of the constellation Dragon or the Great Serpent in the following wise . He asked the people to believe that the entrance of the Great Pyramid was the “bottomless pit” or Hell, as they named the Hades of their forefathers! At the same time computing that the one thousand eight hundred and seventy seven inches from the beginning of the Grand Gallery of the Pyramid stood for A . D . 1877 y ears since the birth of the Lamb, and that there remained but a few inches more to bring the gallery to its end, he maintained it to be a prophecy .

In the Mosaic account we first read of Chaldea ( Genesis , x, 10) when Nimrod, the son of Cush and the grandson of Ham, conquers the four cities respectively named “Babel and Erech, and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar”; and again, when we are informed that Abraham “went forth from Ur of the Chaldees” ( Genesis , xi, 31). The Bible, causing the world to be created in the 710th year of the Julian period (4004 years B.C .), the Deluge to o ccur in 2348 and Abraham to be born in 1996 B.C . (which would allow but a period of 2 89 for the Chaldean or Akkadian civilization, preceded by another still more archaic to develop!), finally gets hopelessly entangled in its own chronology, and thus, owing to its own contradictions and lapsus calami proves quite the reverse of what it evidently intended to prove from the beginning. It plainly shows the existence of another and distinct element in Chaldea . A race, neither Hamitic nor Semitic but what is now called the Akkadian . Since the Bible mentions the city of Akkad as conquered by Nimrod, whose race-name is due to his genealogy, that city must have then existed before him; and the Cushite —————— * [See Book III, Ch . 5, 16 of The Anabasis , or Expedition of Cyrus . . . , literally translated from the Greek of Xenophon by Rev .

This people then, evidently preceded the savage race of the “mighty hunter before the Lord . ” And they must have been a highly civilized nation long before the days of the Noachian “universal” deluge (of which geology certainly shows no traces), as it is well proved that Nimrod, now identified with Sargon I, found upon his arrival there a people, whose high culture was then at its climax . That nation, which had long since abandoned the nomadic pastoral state in which the patriarchal descendants of Shem indulged for ages yet to come, were these “mysterious” Akkadians or Chaldeans, whose name both upon classical and biblical authority designates not only a nation but that peculiar priestly caste initiated in and entirely devoted to the Sciences of astrology and magic .

Neither are they themselves a pure, primitive race, as it is a mixture of the white and yellow races, and the people who belong to it offer an infinite gradation of hues and types, a gradual descent from the pure European down to the Chinese type . Notwithstanding this, their common origin is shown in the affinities of language, religion and customs . The languages of the Turanian nations lack that firmness and definite form of a type which would enable us to call them a step towards the formation of the human speech, says Max Müller ( The Languages of the Seat of War in the East , p . 88) . * As to their religions, they “never rose higher than a form of gross naturalism which transforms all the phenomena of nature into two numberless hosts of Spirits good and bad and whose cultus consists unexceptionally of magic and incantations,” declares F .

As to the Thibetans, they maintain that the forefathers of their Hobilgans and Shaberons, or the higher and initiated Lamas, were those wonderful men who lived on a fairy island, an Eden in the centre of Gobi when that dreary desert was yet a vast sea . They were giants in whom, passing from one to another, moved incessantly the Spirit of Fo, or Budda (the highest wisdom) . As to the rest of the Lamas and Thibetans, they were ancestors created by the former from pieces of every plant, mineral and animal on the globe, which theory looks suspiciously like that of our modern evolutionists . In their turn, our men of science, who, but a few years ago yet, had to pretend in their official capacities at least, that they believed in the fable of Eden, declared at one time unanimously that the cradle of humanity was on the plateau of Pamir , whence flow out the four great rivers : Indus, Helmund, the Oxus, or Jehoona, and Jaxartes or Sir-Darya, the ancient Sihon . The separation of the Turanians took place in two directions : one branch went up northward and settled in the vicinity of Altai, the Aral Sea, and the valleys of the Ural mountains, from where after that it scattered along the North of Europe and Asia down to the Baltic on one side and up to the mouth of the Amur on the other; while the other and no less numerous tribes of Turan chose the Southern and Western direction, when some of them reached Armenia and Asia Minor, and others settled at the foot of the upland plateau of Iran in the valleys of Susiana and the shores of the Tigris and the Euphrates, where for ages they had anticipated the appearance of the Semites and the Cushites . Thus the traditions of the quite savage and of the civilized but “inferior races,” as well as the scientific theories of the European or “superior” races, concur in this admirably . Whether the cradle of humanity is here or there, it circles within the limits of Central Asia .

In ancient times Egypt was called “the land of Ham” ( Psalms , cv, 23) from Kham, its chief diety; Susiana and Arabia were styled Kissoea and Cush; and the countries of the Hamitic races were called Æthiopia . Herodotus repeatedly mentions the Æthiopians of Asia, placing their country at the South of modern Afghanistan, now Kerman and Baluchistan .

George Rawlinson, the brother of our eminent archeologist, Sir Henry,—endeavours to assign to these Ethiopians a Turanian or Scytho-Tartar origin . “Hamitism,” he says, “although no doubt the form of speech out of which Semitism was developed, is itself Turanian rather than Semitic,” and adds in the shape of a more elaborate explanation “the Turanian is an earlier stage of the Hamitic . ” We shall turn then to this Scytho-Tartar race and see whether we can find anything in them to connect them either with the Turanian Chaldees or primitive “black race” to which belonged the authors of the earliest history, and records of the “religion of magic” now translated from the Assyrian cylinders .

And speaking of these Hippocrates describes their personal appearance as different from that of the rest of mankind and “like to nothing but itself . ” Repulsive in the extreme, “their bodies are gross and fleshly; their joints are loose and yielding; the belly flabby . . . and all closely resemble one another . ” A half-nomadic people, barbarous even in the days we are accustomed to look upon as such; warlike savages, is it of them that our modern Assyriologists say that “they took part in, and assisted in the most ancient culture of our human races”?* The foundation and progress of which culture relates in the opinion of our Orientalists to such a hoary antiquity that the memory of it is lost even in the most ancient records of humanity; and whose language—now proved as having been the language of an immense literature—“was a dead language at least two thousand years B.C .”?† H istorically our records go no farther than a few centuries B .

Rawlinson, seek to prove that they belonged to the Indo-European race . With such a positive data in hand, we have no better means than to make the most we can of one unimpeachable material at hand, the autobiography of these people traced by their own hand for countless generations . But before we do so, we have to explain to the readers how the men of science view these famous cylinders, and what they are . Owing to the constant efforts of the Orientalists a series of most unexpected, amazing discoveries were made for the last few years . Under heaps of garbage and mountains of crumbling ruins a whole library, which when translated, will be composed of many thousands of volumes, has recently been excavated . The subject of these records refers mostly to the development of the religious ideas of the aborigines of these regions where the world sees if not the cradle at least one of the cradles, and the principal one where humanity evoluted into its present shape . But they also contain the history of peoples and races of which we moderns had no idea . True, it is but a fragmentary history, of which, owing to so many tiles being broken and as many crumbled into dust, many a link is now missing; yet enough to show that, while cities and kingdoms and peoples, and whole races, some of them with the highest of civilizations rose and developed, but to degenerate and fall; and religions and philosophies, arts and sciences passing like Chinese shadows on the white walls of Time, appear—like all concrete and temporary things—but to disappear into the abyss of motionless Eternity; there are abstract ideas which never die . These ideas now attributed to superstition of the grossest kind and called incantations, belief in good and bad demons, in short MAGIC, are denounced in the most bitter way . On one hand it is the Christians who arrogate to themselves the monopoly of teaching the world about angels and devils in their own way; and on the other by the men of Science 336  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS who believe in neither and would destroy at one stroke every belief but in themselves . Th e Orientalists think that the Turanians, the predecessors of Nimrod, entered the Euphrates-Tigris valley, having already a certain culture which they brought with them from another locality . Besides the cuneiform mode of writing which they had invented before their arrival, either they or the “black race” which they found there had another kind of characters, ideographic signs, a rude form of hieroglyphics which was used for expressing the symbolical image of whether a concrete object or an abstract idea . When these signs had acquired a phonetic value the ideographic forms gradually lost their character, the signs represented no more the objects which they symbolized but a simple combination of various arrow-headed lines mostly horizontal . They read from left to right, are either stamped or cut, occur on tablets cut in rocks, on stone-slabs, on bass-reliefs, on Assyrian winged bulls, on sun-baked or kiln-burnt bricks or small cylinders, on seals, some of the inscriptions being so minute as to require a microscope . All this system of signs answered fully to the agglutinative idiom of the Turanians, and were accepted by the"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Cushites of the Tigro-Euphratean valley at a much later period . The researches upon these elementary arrow-headed signs and their comparisons with material objects gave that important result that the cuneiform characters are now known to have originated in a more Northern region than Chaldea; in a land with quite another fauna and flora, where, for instance there were no lions but of wolves and bears in abundance, where neither the palm nor the vine were known but trees with acerose leaves, pines and firs abounded (G . Smith The Phonetic Values of the Cuneiform Characters , p . 4) . * While paleography helped by paleology proved so much, archaeology was discovering that the “oldest tombs in Chaldea carry us back to as great an antiquity as the Egyptian —————— * [Smith, George .

I, p . 118) . * The religion of the aborigines who preceded the alleged Turanians, notwithstanding the assertions of some Orientalists to the contrary, did not differ essentially from the latest form of the Chaldeo-Babylonian beliefs as now shown by the tiles and monuments . If one was a “rude form of primitive fetishism” so was the other, though personally we are inclined to believe that both were as philosophical at the bottom as any of the religious systems of antiquity or especially the one which followed and aided by sword and fire supplanted them . The very suggestive fact that the Chaldeans whose proficiency in mathematics and astronomy was renowned from the first glimpse of history could not very well be at the same time superstitious and fetish-worshipping fools, has never seemed to strike our Orientalists . None of them was ever known to remark that the people whom Aristotle found to have taken the most correct astronomical observations during a period of no less than 1903 years, could not at the same time credit “magic” and belief in incantations, talismans and amulets as they did, had not all these a more philosophical basis of truth in them than is suggested by these terms in our own century . Unless one makes a special study of that system by the light of occult Sciences, a student of these religious systems risks never to rise higher than dead letter superficiality . And it is not very likely that under the present circumstances and with the objurgation which rests upon the claims of psychology and the misunderstood phenomena of Spiritualism and Occultism especially, the Orientalist would go to that length . Their surest though hitherto unacknowledged guide in their opinions and sentences passed upon the “magic” of the ancients, are the magical rites and belief in good and bad demons as practiced under the name of religious doctrines in the Roman Catholic and Greek Eastern Church .

F . Lenormant, a zealous member of the Popish Church, express his opinion upon the religion of the Chaldees by stating that, no more than the rest of the ancient creeds, it “never rose higher than the worship of nature . ” That solitary fact that the Akkadians represented our Earth in the shape of a boat, not oblong as those we are acquainted with, but perfectly round, like a slightly flattened ball with the top cut off, as was in use with the Chaldeans, and in incessant circling motion on the ocean of space, proves already that their Magi were far ahead of the Christian fathers, the early as the mediaeval ones . We doubt whether any of the former, with their enormous knowledge of astronomy, would have compared to an Augustine scouting the sphericity of the earth as it would prevent the antipodes from seeing the Lord Christ when he descended from heaven at the second advent; or a Lactantius, who thought it would make the men at the other side of the earth walk with their heads downward; or finally the holy wiseacres who came very nearly burning Galileo for his anti-scriptural blasphemy . Whether such prejudiced ideas about “Magic” will be much dispelled even now is what we still doubt . That Magic flourished among the Chaldeans as it did with the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Aryans and every other people was always known . But what was never known, owing to prejudice, was in what consisted that Magic . Even now that a whole library upon the subject is found by Layard and Smith on the ancient sites of Chaldea, unless they learn to read its contents by the light of other like works, our men of Science will never understand its significance .

Obliged to keep within the narrow limits of a journal article, we must avoid every useless disquisition and hold as much as possible to facts . Hence we will briefly pass in review the several hypotheses that various Orientalists and men of Science have evolved out of their fancy from the very meagre material and data they have at their disposal . What they call Magic is simply incantations to numberless cosmical powers personified under the form of good and bad spirits .

It can be still less from Protestantism . For if we mistake not, though the many Protestant sects differ on more than one point, nearly all agree in believing that the departed Soul whether that of a Saint or a Sinner is already judged and doomed before it separates from its body . Hence no need of prayers for it . It will awake on the last day of Judgment when “Christ will judge the quick and the dead,” to regain its body, together with its consciousness i . e . its conscious individuality; which will be either rewarded with eternal beatitude or be cast unto eternal damnation . And, as they recognize no intermediate purgatory like the Roman Catholics, some of them seem to be very confused in their notions as to this particular question .

And as the former teaches a state of purgatory, and the latter, though rejecting such a state, yet allows to every sinner and every blessed Soul a proportionate amount of either damnation or beatitude, before the hour of final reckoning or the Great Day of Judgment settles their account, it also accounts for the fact that, . . . . —————"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME XIII P OSTHUMOUSLY P UBLISHED 342  BLAVATSKY : C OLLECTED WRITINGS PALIBOTHRA OF MEGASTHENES [Fragment in H .

And while Pliny places “Palibothra” 425 Roman miles below the junction of the Ganges and the Jumna, Strabo, following Erastosthenes, gives its distance from the mouth of the Ganges at 6,000 stadia . Arrian moreover calls the “other” river near Ganges Erranoboas . And though both Arrian and Pliny make a clear distinction between the Sona and the mythical Erranoboas, yet Prof . Max Müller followed by Mr . Cunningham do not hesitate to identify both as Sona, the same river “where the ancient Palibothra stood . ” As an unanswerable corroboration of the statement, and explanation given to an objection raised by D . Wilson, he holds that “though at present Patna is not situated near the confluence of the Ganges and the Sona . . . . this, however, has been explained by a change in the bed of the river Sona . . . established on the best geographical evidence . ”* The “evidence” of the geographers is no doubt unimpeachable; but this evidence does not establish either the year or even the approximate period when the Sona ——————— * [See p . 250 of Śā str ī ’s ed . of Max Müller’s History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature . ] ——————— P ALIBOTHRA OF M EGASTHENES  343 d eserted its bed .

Cunningham who accepts and insists upon the identification to settle their differences, with the evidences to the contrary brought forward by opponents who show most weighty and evident reasons why the Sona cannot be the Erranoboas (See Archeological Survey , Vol . VIII), the attention of the learned Surveyors may be drawn to the following : A more minute examination will show that the Sona has changed its course since the days of the Mah ā bh ā rata where it is"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"mentioned several times and since Buddha ’ s time—twice . And that neither of the periods of the two deviations could possibly furnish a corroborative evidence in favour of the statement of classical writers, is shown in our texts . We are not concerned with the epoch of the last deviation of that restless river, which may or may not have happened as stated in the Survey shortly “before the Muhammedan invasion”; but with that time which would reconcile the Greek statements with the actual direction of the flow of the Sona . And to our knowledge neither period will serve the purpose . For, if the geographical evidence and the topographical inferences drawn from various allusions to this religio-historical stream in the Mah ā bh ā rata , a nd the R ā m ā y ana and the travels of Hiouen-Thsang and Fa-hian, j ustify the conclusion that the Sona has once more wandered off its bed somewhere between the two centuries that preceded the Muhammedan invasion of India, our texts connect its first deviation positively with Buddha’s death . Thus whether the Sona changed its bed in the 6th cent . “ B.C .” or the 8th “ A.D .,” it was not at the time of Megasthenes (4th c ent . before the Christian era) — “where Palibothra stood . ” Among the many legends connected with the Lord Buddha’s Nirvana Mahanada Sona (the great red river) is mentioned among the seven rivers which ran off in various directions “to avoid witnessing the sorrow of the host of Arhats and Bikkhus (settled on the shores of various rivers) at the death of their Lord . ” Though a far more natural phenomenon than the parallel one alleged to have happened 500 years later, 344  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS when “the veil of the temple was rent in twain . . . and the graves were opened; and many o f the saints which slept arose and went into the holy city”, etc . —it is not even attempted to connect the deviation of the streams with the Sage’s death in any miraculous direct way . But unless the actual fact of coincidence is accepted, then the compiler of legendary lore would have to be credited with prophetic prevision; for he says distinctly that the “Mahanada Sona turned away and flowed back Eastward ”; — a fact corroborating the repetition of the same phenomenon later since the Sona flows nowadays Westward .

Carpenter to finally show us what prepossession and expectancy which are given by such leading parts in the melodrama of those who are not ignorant of the fact that the ancients for long ages, previous to the Neo-Platonic school or the Hermetic philosophies, discovered, that in order that the human Voltaic battery should decompose and analyse the occult properties of nature, it required in addition to the physical a second and spiritual brain . Such a brain is either a gift of nature, in which case the person endowed with it is according to Cornelius Agrippa “a natural-born magician,” or, it is acquired by a long and painful self-development . For though, the common property of all, it yet may remain in its latent state during the course of a whole human life .

Why not rather infer that since between the high civilizations of Greece and Rome and the Modern one—hardly 200 years old—there was the black gap of the dark and Middle Ages, the miniature scale of one of the smaller cycles, so there may have been a similar gap between the older Babylonians and Chaldeans and such high civilization as traced by every [word illegible] unbiased Orientalist in Egypt and Babylonia 10 and 15,000 years, and the preceding high civilizations of sub-races now extinct .

All is an emanation from his being, the nearer to him the purer, the farther the more impure . Before the creation the Primal Light filled all, so that there was no void at all; but when the Supreme Being, residing within this light, resolved to display his perfections in the worlds; he retired within himself and formed around him a void space .

We need hardly say then that by “fire” they did not mean the material, visible fire, but that subtle invisible Spirit of the flame, the quintessence of all the attributes of fire which has, and ever will escape analysis and detection by “chemical processes”; though it may be sometimes experienced by the superphysical light of the spiritually trained mind . To the modern student of experimental sciences, in whose eyes even Reichenbach’s aura of “Odyle Force” is a pure hallucination, and hence remains absent from the scientific nomenclature, the above words must appear void of all sense . But for the student of psychology who knows anything of the properties of animal magnetism and—Mesmerism, the meaning will be clear .

May not the same perchance be required in biology? As the scientific man, according to their own confession stood perplexed, and unable for a long time to solve the enigma why a single cell should not decompose water, so the biologists and the psychologists (of exact science) stand helpless before certain phenomena of mind . They are unable to perceive the true bearing of that Hermetic Divine “Fire” already adverted to, upon the phenomena of the human Voltaic battery known as the brain; a “fire” which may sometimes be generated and developed on the same principle as one of its correlations—heat (as in the case of artificial mesmeric development of clairvoyance) .

The English might feel better for the disappearance from the scene of the man, one of whose latest plans was the rousing of rebellion against them of India with the help of Ireland’s revolutionaries and Indians (Sikhs) .

House, 1948, 65 pp . — Compiler . ] Mesmerism and hypnotism differ completely in their method . In hypnotism the nerve-ends of the sense-organs are first fatigued and then by continuance of the fatigue are temporarily paralyzed; and the paralysis spreads inwards to the sense-center in the brain, and a state of trance results . The fatigue is brought about by the use of some mechanical means, such as a revolving mirror, a disc, an electric light, etc . A frequent repetition of this fatigue predisposes the patient to fall readily into a state of trance, and permanently weakens the sense-organs and the brain . When the Ego has left his dwelling, and the brain is thus rendered passive, it is easy for another person to impress ideas of action upon it, and the ideas will then be carried out by the patient, after coming out of trance, as though they were his own . In all such cases he is the mere passive agent of the hypnotizer . The method of true mesmerism is entirely different . The mesmerizer throws out his own Auric Fluid . . . through the etheric double, on his patient; he may thus, in the case of sickness, regularize the irregular vibrations of the sufferer, or share with him his own life-force, thereby increasing his vitality .

The loss of vitality should be made good by standing in the sun, with as little clothing on as possible, breathing deeply and slowly, and retaining the breath between each inspiration and exhalation as long as is convenient, i . e . , not long enough to cause any struggle or gasping .

Magnetism, it was stated, is an emanation which arises from all things, the earth, animal and vegetable life; it is a physiological thing and arises from prana; which is the individual life principle . The aura is an individualization of a Universal Life Principle (Jiva) and endures with a man in spite of his periodical changes of state and planes . The aura is the origin of the feeling of sympathy and antipathy; it is a magnetic emanation of prana but in combination with manas and buddhi . In this connection it may be noted that memory is the effect of buddhi upon manas . The process of “psychologizing” is performed by will-power and is effected by and affects the aura . A discussion arose as to the distinction between will and desire . Desire has to do with a man’s success but less than will or karma . Outside the animal kingdom desire ought only to have concern with one of the higher principles . Desire is a Kamic principle, it is Typhonic, a disturbing power and is opposed to will, which latter is an emanation from the seventh and sixth principles . Desire is an energy which ought to be repressed; when repressed the energy is scattered and goes to the universal energy but is not lost . It is got rid of by the man himself when repressed, but if given effect hangs round his neck like a mill-stone in the form of Karma . After death a man exists in Kama-loka encased in the Kama-rupa or bundle of desires which restrains the higher principles from B LAVATSKY L ODGE M INUTES  365 p assing entirely into Devachan . On his return thence man finds the Karma of unrepressed Desire waiting for him at the threshold . Hence the real punishment of Karma arises from the presence of desires which have to be repressed . This is done by the effort of will; which is not infinite and has a beginning and an end . But will is the manifestation of an eternal law which is appreciable only in its effects and in this place it was said that absolute will is not the same as Kosmic Will . Thus Man as the microcosmos is gifted with freewill; but is limited by the action of other free wills under the law of universal harmony"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"which is Karma . The real function of willpower is to produce harmony between the law and man . Thus the Mahatma being without desire is outside of the sphere of action of Karma; His real condition is in harmony with nature and is Karma and its agent and hence is outside its action . His physical body is however still within its limits of action . Thus the direction of will should be towards realizing one’s aspirations which are Buddhic, when the intellectual fifth principle is nearly merged in buddhi the sixth . These aspirations may be called “glimpses into the eternal . ” The lower consciousness mirrors aspirations unconsciously to itself and then itself aspires and is elevated if things are in accord . Such an aspiration would be a tendency towards Theosophy; this instinct if developed becomes a conscious aspiration . A distinction was drawn between obstinancy, firmness and will . Obstinacy results from an obscuration of the reason and may be compared to the two halves of the brain acting in opposition when the work is obstructed . Firmness may be said to result from equilibration of these two . Upon this firmness will is based and starts from this equilibration to work . —————— 366  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS [ While the following fragment from the Blavatsky Lodge Minutes Book concerns a meeting on June 2, 1887, it was entered on June 23rd, 1887 . — Compiler . ] At a meeting of the Blavatsky Lodge held at Maycot on Thursday, June 2, 1887, the f ollowing question was propounded through the President . Some members of a Group would be glad to know whether by any occult means it would be possible to ameliorate the mental condition of someone who had been insane for eleven years . The supposed cause of the insanity being a shock received when in the somnambulistic state . No personal communication would be possible between the members of the group and that person . Should the mental condition be immutable, could the soul be aided to advance spiritually? Madame Blavatsky replied that a person awakened suddenly from a somnambulistic trance and becoming afterwards insane, could only be recovered with enormous difficulty . That it was just possible that, by watching for a similar state and repeating the shock, a reversal of the current might take place . That dependent on the age of the person and the Karmic result, reincarnation might have already taken place and in that case no amelioration could be effected . That the body might merely retain its vitality linked to the soul in Devachan that a person so restored was probably not the same person . The following answer was finally sent : “It is considered that the higher principles have left the patient and that there are no means of effecting any amelioration .

He disposed of all his property as a h indrance to his search for knowledge. He studied under Anaximenes of Miletus, and later settled at Athens. His disciples were Socrates, Euripedes, Archelaus, and others of repute. As an Astronomer, he was the first to openly explain the planetary movements, eclipses, etc. His theory of Chaos . . . “nothing comes from nothing”, and “atoms as the essence of all” . . . originating from universal intelligence or Nous, foreshadowed much of present day philosophy. He stated that stars were of the same material as the earth, that the sun was a glowing mass, and the moon was a dark uninhabitable body which reflected the sun. “The real existence of things perceived by the senses, can never be proved.” He died at age 72 at Lampsacus. An edition of his collected fragments has been published by E. Schauhach, Leipsig, 1827; by W. Schorn, Bonn, 1829. A RCHYTUS (ca. 428.347 B.C .). Greek philosopher, mathematician and statesman of Tarentum who b elonged to the Pythagorean school and was an intimate friend of Plato. Elected seven times commander of the army. Tradition says he was drowned on a voyage across the Adriatic, and was buried at Matinum in Apulia. He is described as the eighth leader of the Pythagorean school, and as a pupil of Philolaus. Fragments of his ethical and metaphysical writings are quoted by Stobaeus, Simplicius and others. He is said to have solved the problem of the doubling of the cube, to have invented the methods of analytical geometry, to have been the first to apply the principles of mathematics to mechanics, and to have constructed various machines, such as the wooden flying dove. The study of acoustics and music were also advanced by his investigations. A RGYLL, G EORGE J OHN D OUGLAS C AMPBELL, E IGHTH D UKE OF (1823-1900).

Secretary of State for India under Gladstone, 1868. In spite of later political disagreement, his personal relations with Gladstone, based on common intellectual interests, remained unchanged. His chief preoccupation was the reconciliation of the dogma of Christianity with advancing scientific progress. Among his works which had a considerable influence on Victorian thought may be mentioned: *The Reign of Law, 1866; PrimeVal Man, 1869; The Unity of Nature, 1884.

He held the chair of ancient philosophy at the college de France from 1838 on, and became a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Science, 1839. Appointed senator for life in 1875, he was minister of foreign affairs in the cabinet of Jules Ferry. He combined political interests with a great deal of scholarly research and writing. In addition to his monumental work on Aristotle (35 volumes), he wrote: Des Védas (1854); Le Bouddha et sa Religion (1860); Du Bouddhisme (1855); Mahomet et le Coran (1865). 374 BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS B AYLE, P IERRE . French critic, and embattled Protestant philosopher. Born November 18, 1647 at Carlat, s on of Jean Pastor, and Jennes de Brugnieres. He was educated at the universities of Puylaurens and Toulouse, briefly tried Catholicism. At Geneva, theology courses developed discussion and thus his penchant toward scepticism. He was preceptor in several homes in Paris, before becoming Professor of Philosophy at Sedan, remaining till October 1681, then filling the same post at Rotterdam until 1693. While at Sedan, he had started his letter on the comet of 1680, which was published anonymously in 1682, also (anonymously) his criticism of Maimbourg’s Calvinism, which author had been burned by the inquisition. Bayle’s notoriety became considerable. In 1684, he published a few curious pieces on M. Descartes’ philosophy, and founded the periodical News of the Republic of Letters. Deprived of his post in 1693, he labored 14 hours a day for 4 years on his magnum opus, Dictionnaire Critique et Historique, which first appeared in two folio volumes, 1695-96, and was promptly banned in France. A new edition appeared in Holland twice the original size, with the author promising to modify certain ideas, but little changes were made, and it was placed on the Pope’s Index. Editions of 1702, 1713, 1720, and 1730 appeared with Bayle’s supplements. An early English edition was the 10 volume folio of 1735-41, with the last volume as an Index. This work was the forerunner of all biographical dictionaries, and is unique in that the author gave free reign to his opinions throughout. In personal habits Bayle was remarkable for his simplicity, and in character irreproachable. He died December 23, 1706. B IRCH , S AMUEL (b. November 3, 1813—d. December 27, 1885).

He administered several missions to investigate bovine pests in England and elsewhere 1865.1867, and was elected to the Academy of Sciences in 1868; replaced Claude Bernard in the Chair of Comparative Pathology of the Museum, 1879. He also was instrumental in obtaining legislation towards strict sanitary regulations in France. He wrote an almost infinite number of papers on every aspect of animal health and disease, and was the author of: Lecons de pat hologie cornparée, (au Muséum) Paris, 1882-1883; 2 Vols. son Traitée de l’organisation du pied du cheval, Paris, 2 Vols., 1851. He also collaborated on several dictionaries, periodicals, and treatises. He died November 30th, 1885. B RUCE, J AMES (1730-1794). Scottish explorer of Africa, born at Kinnard House, Sterlingshire, December 1 4th. Educated at Harrow and Edinburgh Universities, his wife dying in 1754 after nine months of marriage. Curiosity about oriental MSS. studied at the Escurial in Spain, determined his future Arabic studies. In 1763 he was Council at Algiers commissioned to study antiquities in the area. In 1765 while journeying to various sites, he was shipwrecked, swam ashore, and continued to explore in the Middle East making careful drawings as he went. During this period, he gained enough knowledge of medicine to pass as a physician in these countries. In 1768 he began the quest for the source of the Nile, and reached Abyssinia in 1770, where he was well accepted, a rarity for foreigners. It was during this period of over two years when on good terms with negus Tekla Haimanot II, Ras Micheal the ruler of Abyssinia, and his wife Ozoro Esther, and the people of the country in general, that Bruce obtained many valuable manuscripts, including the Book of Enoch, portions of the Pistis Sophia, and others of major import, now deposited at the Bodleian Library. After difficult travels, he reached Cairo in 1773 and London in 1774, where his accounts of his explorations were received with incredulity. His major work is: —Travels to discover the Source of the Nile, London, 1805, 5 Vols., again 1813, (8 Vols., with a biography by Alexander Murray, pub. at Edinburgh) , He died 27th, April, 1794. 376 BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS B RUGSCH- B EY, H EINRICH K ARL (1827.1894).

C ARPENTER, W ILLIAM B ENJAMIN . Naturalist. He was the eldest son of Dr. Lant Carpenter. He was born a t Exeter on 29 October, 1813. His father removed to Bristol in 1817. Young Carpenter received his early education there in his father’s notable school, and acquired both exact classical and scientific knowledge. He passed some time in the West Indies as companion to Mr. Estlin. After preliminary work at Bristol Medical School, Carpenter entered University College, London in 1833, as a medical student. After obtaining the Surgeons’ and Apothecaries’ diplomas in 1835 he went to the Edinburgh Medical School and commenced researches on physiology. He wrote papers which showed a marked tendency to seek large generalizations and to bring all the natural sciences to the elucidation of vital functions. His Principles of General and Comparative Physiology, published in 1839 was the first English book which contained adequate conceptions of a science of biology. He found the anxieties of general medical practice too great for his keen susceptibilities, and undertook further literary work, including a useful and comprehensive Popular Cyclopedia of Science, 1843. In 1844, be moved to London. In 1856, on appointment as registrar of the University of London till his resignation in 1879, when he received the distinction of a C.B., he was appointed a crown member of the senate on the next vacancy and continued an active member till his death, which occurred on 19 November, 1885. In 1862 the Ray Society published his Introduction to the Study of the Foraminifera. Some of Carpenter’s most important zoological contributions related to the questions of the animal nature of Eozoon Canadense as found in masses in the Laurentian rocks of Canada. He contributed numerous papers on this subject to the Royal Society, the Canadian, Naturalist (ii. 1865), the Intellectual Observer (viii, 1865), Philosophical Magazine (1865), Geological Society’s Quarterly Journal, &c. For some years before his death he had been collecting materials for a monograph on Fozoon, which he did not complete. Another favorite subject of his research was the structure, embryology, and past history of the feather-stars and crinoids in which he demonstrated important facts of structure and physiology, which were long controverted. His chief paper was “On the Structure, Physiology, and Development of Antedon rosaceus” (Philosophical Transactions, 1866, pp. 671.756). Among his services to zoology, and in a lesser degree to botany, may be reckoned his work on The Microscope and its Revelations, 1856, which reached a sixth edition in 1881. His zoological and botanical and other contributions to the Cyclopedia of Science were afterwards published in separate volumes in Bohn,’s ‘Scientific Library’. The Comparative Physiology of his early Physiology was published separately as an enlarged fourth edition in 1854. In addition to his principal book, Carpenter’s contributions to physiology were chiefly to the mental and physical aspects of the science. His early papers were followed by others: “On the Mutual Relations of the Vital and Physical Force to Physiology” (Quarterly Journal of Science i. 1864). His view on the relation of mind and brain were acute and in advance of his time. Carpenter’s deep-sea explorations led him into an extensive field of marine physics. He developed the doctrine of a general oceanic circulation due largely to heat, cold, and evaporation, which had been previously little suspected. Carpenter’s incessant industry enabled him to take part in many public movements with effect. In 1849, he gained a prize for an essay On the Use and Abuse of ‘Alcoholic Liquors’ (1850), and he wrote further On the Physiology of Temperance and Total Abstinence (1853). He regarded miracles not as violations of natural order, but as manifestations of a higher order. His acceptance of Darwin’s views of evolution was somewhat limited and reserved. He believed that natural selection leaves untouched the evidence of design in creation. In philosophy he especially clung to the reality of an independent will beyond automatism. 378 BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"C ASSIANUS, J OANNES F REMITA , (or Joannes Massiliensis).

After education by the J esuits, he turned to poetry briefly before rejecting his father’s business in favor of the study of ancient languages at the Sorbonne, thus cutting off his inheritance. He then became tutor for the Duchess of Tremolle. Admitted to l’Academie des inscriptions 1753, he wrote Traite historique d ela religion des Perses, in volumes 25, 27, 29, 31, and 39 of Memoires of the Academy. In this treatise he discusses the origins of the Zoroastrian religion, and its comparisons with that of the Hebrew, Pythagorean, Platonic, and Gnostic systems; refutes Thomas Hyde’s De religione Persarum, concerning the purity of the basis of Magianism. F REPPEL , C HARLES E MILE . French bishop and politician, born at Oberehenheim, Alsace, June 1, 1827; d ied at Angers, December 12, 1891. Consecrated Bishop at Angers, 1870. Elected, 1880, deputy for Brest. Being the only priest in the Chamber of Deputies, he became the chief parliamentary champion of the Church, voting of course with the Royalist and Catholic party. Among his many scholarly works is the one entitled *Les Apologistes chrétiens au second siécle (1860, 2 Vols.). FRESNEL, FULGENCE. French Orientalist born at Mathieu April 15, 1795. His youth was devoted to scientific pursuits, translating Berzelius aud later translating Tieck from German, in 1821. At Maronites College, Rome, he studied Arabic before going to Egypt in 1831. There he studied with the Mullas, aud became consular agent at Djeddah in 1837, becoming proficient in the chikili aud makhri dialects aud with Arabic to an extent that he was consulted by the sheiks. He was the first to translate Himyarite inscriptions, aud wrote of a variety of topics including pine-Islamic history. Returning to Europe, he was placed in charge of the expedition to Mesopotamia in 1851 in company with Felix Thomas aud Jules Oppert. Recalled in 1854, Fresnel elected to remain. He died at Bagdad, November 30, 1855. His writings on the ex’pedition are contained in M. Oppert’s work, Expedition en Mesopotamie, 2 Vols., 1858, 1863. A few of Finesnel’s more important works; Hoa-tchou-onan ou le Livre rnysterieux, Paris, 1822; Poesies du desert de Schanfara, Paris 1834; Recherches sur les inscriptions himyariques, dans Journal asiatique, Paris 1845; Memoire de M. Fresnel, consul de France d Djeddah, sur les caravanes du Wadog, dans Annales des Voyages, (no date). Fresuel was an accomplished linguist aud his abilities in Arabic were considered extraordinary. FRST, JULIUS. German Orientalist, born of Jewish parents at Zerkowo in Posen, May 12, 1805; died at Leipzig, February 9, 1872.

Named magistrate reporter for the state council, 1837. In 1842, Bastia named him envoy to the Chamber of Deputies where he displayed considerable eloquence. He journeyed to the Orient in 1847, protesting against Fevinier’s revolution from Cairo, aud then changing from political interests to the defense of Pro~ testantism, which occupied the remainder of his years. Christianism aud Paganism, was published in Geneva, 2 Vols., 1846. This began a long series of similar works which included treatises on moral behavior, family life, etc. He was a vehement pacifist, aud made exertions against the Franco-Prussian war, which due to his proximity to the border (Leman, since 1849) hastened his demise, on May 14th, 1871. His last published work was France, 2 Vols., Paris, 1872. GINSBURG, CHRISTIAN DAVID. Born December 25, 1831. Educated in his native city at Rabbinic College. With special attention to the Megilloth, he translated the Song of Songs with a commentary in London, 1857. This was followed by a translation of Ecelesiastes (Coheleth) 1861; The Karaites, Their History and Literature, 1862; The Essenes, 1864; The Kabbalah, 1865. In 1867 he edited The Massoreth-Ha-Massoreth of Elias Levita; The Moabite Stone, (tin.) 1870. In that year he was appointed to the committee for the revision of the English version of the Old Testament. His life work culminated in the publication of the Massorab in 3 volumes, 1880-1886. To obtain materials for it, he scoured the libraries aud monasteries of Europe aud the Middle East to discover many obscure manuscripts, over a period of 25 years. He next published Leviticus with Commentary, 1885; The Masoretico-Critical Edition of the hebrew Bible, 1894; Facsimiles of Manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible, 1897-1898; The Text of the Hebrew Bible in Abbreviations, 1903; and, “On the Relationship of The So Called Codex Babylonaicus of A.D. 916 to the Eastern Reseension of the Hebrew Text,” 1899, for private circulation. He contributed many articles to Smith’s Dictionary of Christian Biography, Kitto’s Encyclopedia, and, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica 11th edition a valuable article on the Kabbalab. It is possible he used the pen name “Nurho de Manhar” for a translation of the Zohar that appeared serially in E. T. Hargrove’s periodical The Word. The manuscript used differs from both the Mautua & Cremona MSS. of the Zohar, aud halts abruptly on the death of Ginsburg, March 7, 1914. Style aud references to supporting materials, British grammar, typos caused by a remote location of an author unable to proof copy, aud A. E~ Waite’s listing of a “Nurho de Manhar” joining the Golden Dawn in 1888, indicate that Ginsburg may have lead two lives. A reprint of the Zohar by Nurho de Manhar, with commentaries from The Secret Doctrine appended, has been compiled aud published by Wizards Bookshelf, San Diego, 1978; revised, 1980.

Philadelphia inventor possessing peculiar mental aud psychic capacities, who invented a wide variety of devices said to be based on an undiscovered force in nature, related to the harmonics of etheric laya centers. He was first able to demonstrate a machine in 1872, and, unaware of the full implications of his work, formed the “Keely Motor Company” aud BIBLIOGRAPHY 385 issued stock in 1874 in pursuit of commercial success. His first machines were of megalithic proportions, one weighing 22 tons. Most were implemented by the Atlantic Works, aud the Delaware Iron Works, of Philadelphia, aud were scrapped in turn as they were superceded by smaller more sophisticated models. His Generator of 1878 weighed 3 tons, measured 3 x 5 feet, aud had small spherical chambers, five stand tubes of various sizes, aud used but one quart of water to produce 54,000 pounds per square inch pressure. No heat, electricity, or chemicals were used. It was started by moving a four-way valve, there being no other moving parts. Output remained constant regardless of work effected. Unscrupulous stock speculators caused Keely great difficulties, aud Keely himself saw little of the proceeds. Mr. 0. M. Babcock issued in response to countless inquiries, a pamphlet of 32 pages explaining the vicissitudes of the Keely Motor Co. It measures 4” x 6”, aud carries on the front cover Exposition of the Keel y Motor, financial, mechanical, philosophical, historical, aetnal, prospective; Philadelphia, June 1881. On the back cover: The Doom of Steam, Or, the Coming Force, etc., etc. 25. It is now extremely scarce. It was at this time that stockholders obtained court orders against Keely, aud he destroyed many of his machines aud drawings, in fear of confiscation. Later, based on two new inventions, the Vapor Gun, aud the Automatic Water Lift, capital stock was increased from 20,000 to 100,000 shares. The latter invention implemented the raising of water to any height without the application of extraneous power. Of the 80,000 new shares, not 5,000 reached Keely, aud these were used for his necessities. Through manipulation aud frauds, only about one quarter were actually paid for. Through these calumnies his staunch friend aud benefactor Mrs. Clara (nee Jessup) Bloomfield Moore aided him with financial backing aud influence in society. She seemed to be of a keen scientific bent aud ability as demonstrated by her book: Keely aud his Discoveries: Aerial Navigation. Kegan Paul Trench Trubuer Co., London. 1893 (xxviii; 372 pp.) (Reprinted by University Books, NYC, 1972.) Keely had to invent a new terminology to describe his unprecedented ideas, and totally unique machines: Compound Disintegrator, Spirophone, Vibrodyne, Planetary system Engine, Provisional Engine, aud a “Machine for Testing Vibrations under Different Orders of Evolution”. All of these devices were demonstrated successfully during 24 years. By 1888, however,"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"the courts again threatened, aud this time Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore’s son, was able to deprive his mother of all legal aud material rights, thus stopping the flow of his “inheritance” toward Keely’s endeavors. Keely destroyed his Vibratory Microscope 386 BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS aud valuable papers, aud vanished from public view. By the this time he had postulated a system of 7 distinct orders of existence with 3 subdivisions . . . between molecular aud the “interetheric”. He died alone aud destitute in November 1898.

He was born at Exeter on 4 February 1788. In 1793, he began his education under Charles Lloyd, LL.D. aud made such progress that in his twelfth year he was admitted to the Exeter academy as a student for the ministry under his father aud Joseph Bretlaud. His first teaching post was at Devonshire 1804. He continued his theological studies till 1807, when he entered Glasgow University. ON leaving Glasgow he accepted a tutorship in classics, history, aud literature at the Manchester College, York. In July 1817, he was granted a year’s absence for study in Germany. He studied history at Gottingen under Heeren. The following summer semester he devoted to classical study at Berlin under F. A. Wolf, Boeckh, aud Zumpt, aud attended Schleiermacher’s course of philosophy. He returned to York in September 1820, where he remained as tutor till 1840 when the college reverted to Manchester New College. He then became Professor of History, aud held this chair till 1850. Among others, he published The Egypt of Herodotus, &c, 1841; An Essay on Primeval History, &c., 1846; Ancient Egypt under the Pharaohs, &c., 1850, 2 vols; Papers on Archaeology and History, &c., 1864. In 1832, he edited for Bishop Blomfield the fifth edition of the translation of Matthiae’s Greek Grammar, by Edward Valentine Blomfield, the bishop’s younger brother; aud published separately (1833) an hudex of Quotations from Greek Authors contained in it. He died at York on May 7, 1877. KLAPROTH, HEINRICH JULIUS, German Orientalist, born in Berlin, October 11, 1783; died in Paris, August 28, 1835. Son of the chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth (1743.1817). Received an appointment BIBLIOGRAPHY 387 in the St. Petersburg Academy aud accompanied, 1805, Count Golovkin on an embassy to China. Entrusted with an ethnographical aud linguistic exploration in the Caucasus 1807.1808. Later employed for several years in connection with the Academy’s Oriental publications. Moved to Berlin, 1812; settled in Paris, 1815. In 1816, Humboldt procured for him from the King of Prussia the title and salary of professor of Asiatic languages aud literature. His great work was Asia Polyglotta (Paris, 1823 and 1831) formed a new departure for the classification of Eastern languages. He wrote a number of other scholarly works. KING, CHARLES WILLIAM. Author of works on engraved gems was born on September 5, 1818 at Newport, Monmouthshire. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a sizar in October 1836, and was elected scholar of his college in 1839, and fellow in 1842. About 1842 King went to Italy, aud there"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"spent several years studying the Italian language aud literature aud in collecting antique gems. The collection, formed between 1845 aud 1877, ultimately consisted of 331 engraved stones, more than two-thirds of Which were Greek aud Roman, the remainder being Sassanian, Gnostic, aud Oriental. About 1878, when his eyesight was seriously failing, King sold his collection, aud it is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art at New York. After King’s return from Italy his life was chiefly spent at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was widely read in the Greek and Roman classics, without having however, a minute philological knowledge. He had specially studied Pausanias aud Pliney’s Historia. His short-sightedness always rendered reading difficult for him, though he had “a microscopic power of discernment for objects such as gems. His writings on ancient gems are original, aud evince the experience of the practical collector. King’s principal publications are: Antique Gems, London, 1860; The Guosties aud their Remains, London, 1664, 2nd edit. London, 1887. (For a controversy as to misprints aud alterations in this edition see London Atheneum, January-June 1888, p. 441, 468, 499, 535, 662, 696).

German scholar aud mathematician, born at Geisa, near Fulda, May 2, 1601; die d at Rome, November 28, 1680. Educated at the Jesuit College of Fulda, aud became a novice of the order at Mainz, 1618. Taught philosophy, mathematics aud Oriental languages at Wurzburg, from whence he was driven by the Thirty Years War to Avignon in 1631. Settled 1635 at Rome where he taught mathematics in the Collegio Romano, but resigned 1643 to study archaeology. His most famous work is Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652-1655) which together with other works, first called attention to Egyptian hieroglyphics. Altogether he authored 23 valuable works. Vide, BCW Vol. VII, p. 378. K NIGHT, R ICHARD P AYNE. Numismatist, born in 1750, was the eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Knight (1 697-1764). Richard Payne Knight, being of weakly constitution as a boy, was not sent to school till he was fourteen, and did not begin to learn Greek till he was seventeen. He was not at any university. About 1767 he went to Italy, aud remained abroad several years. Knight again visited Italy in 1777, and from April to June of that year was in Sicily in company with Philipp Hackert, the German painter, aud Charles Gore. Knight kept a journal, which under the title of Tagebuch einer Reise nach Sicilien, was translated aud published by Goethe in his biography of ilackert (Goethe, Werke, x’xxvii. 1830, pp. 146-218, cf. pp. 320.4) . In 1780 he became M.P. for Leominster, aud from 1784 to 1806 sat for Ludlow. Knight’s first published work was An Account of the Remains of the Worship of Priapus lately existing in hsernia; to which is added a Discourse on the Worship of Priapus, aud its Connexion with the Mystic Theology of the Ancients, 1786. In 1791, Knight published An Analytical Essay on the Greek Alphabet, London, 4to, with nine plates. In 1808 he printed privately fifty copies (London, 8vo) of his Carmina Homerica, hlias et Odyssea. This consists of Prolegomena, the text being added in the later edition of 1820. Knight printed privately—An Inquiry into the Symbolical Language of Ancient Art aud Mythology, London, (reprinted in Classical Museum, pp. xxiii-xxvii, and in Specimens of Ancient Sculptures, Vol. II, new ed. by A. Wilder, New York, 1876) . Knight also wrote B IBLIOGRAPHY 38 9 for the Classical Museum, the Philological Museum, aud in the Arehaeologia. Knight died at his house in Soho Square, London, on April 23, 1824. L ACOUR, P IERRE. Artist aud painter, born 1746 at Bordeaux. He studied under Vien who was enjoying a reputation at the time, going to Rome later to study the masterpieces there. Though offers came from Paris, he preferred to return to Bordeaux. Up to that time, the Academy at Bordeaux bad limited itself to drawing, but following Lacour’s professorship there, talented painters emerged in every subject"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"area, from portraits to seascapes. The largest collection of Lacour’s paintings remain in Bordeaux, but several are in the Louvre at Paris. His most celebrated work, done in the dominican style, represents St. Paulin, Archbishop of Bordeaux, welcoming the persecuted to his palace. This was Lacour’s last work, aud he died January 28, 1814. L APOUGE, G EORGES V ACHER DE, archeologist aud ethnologist, born at Neuville (Vienne) December 1 2, 1854. Student of law aud mediclue at the Lyceum, Poitiers; Law doctorate in 1879. Minister of the Republic at Blanc aud Chambon, 1880-1883. Graduate student in history aud philology (Assyrian, Egyptian, Hebrew) at the laboratory of Milne-Edwards. From 1883-1886 studied anthropology, Egypt. ology, aud Chinese and Japanese languages at the Louvre. Assistant Librarian at the University of Montpellier 1886-1893; Librarian, University of Rennes, 1893-1900, aud at University of Poitiers 1900-1909. He taught anthropology aud sociology of Assyria at Montpellier before his extensive explorations of caves aud tombs at Cevenues and Herault, collecting several hundred crania. He was a contributor to Revue d’Authropologie, aud several other scientific journals in France aud Germany. In La Nature, he described a large skull found at the cemetery of Castelnau, as well as older aud larger bones of a fossil appearance indicating a human over 7’ in height. (La Nature, 1890, II, pp. 11.12 with fig.). This tended to confirm an old legend that the cavern at Castelnau was the home of giants.

Archbishop of Cashel, born at Bath in 1760. He was educated at Bath grammar school aud at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. After graduating M.A. in 1785, he in 1787 became vicar of Coleshill, Berkshire, where he took pupils. He also contributed to the Monthly Review aud undertook the historical department of the Annual Register. In June 1794, he took the degree of B.C.L. aud D.C.L. as a member of University College. In 1796, he was made deputy professor, aud again settled in Oxford. In 1804, he delivered the Bampton lectures. From youth Laurence read widely in theology aud canon law, aud in later life he studied Oriental languages. Accordingly in 1814, he was appointed regius professor of Hebrew aud a canon of Christ Church, Oxford. In 1822, after the death of his wife, he reluctantly accepted the arebbishopric of Cashel, Ireland. His erudition is well illustrated by the three volumes in which he printed with Latin aud English translations, Ethiopic versions of apocryphal books of the Bible. The first, the Aseensio hsaiae Vatis. Oxford, 1819, which he dated A.D. 68 or 69, furnished in his opinion arguments against the Unitarian falsification of passages in the New Testament. The second The Book of Enoch the Prophet, Oxford, 1821; (other editions) was printed from the Ethiopic manuscript which James Bruce had brought from Abyssinia aud presented to the Bodleian Library. The third was the Ethiopic version of the first book of Esdras, Oxford, 1820. Laurence’s other writings include: A Dissertation upon the Logos of St. John, Oxford, 1808, The Book of Job, in the words of the authorized version, arranged aud printed in general conformity with the Masoretical text (anon.), Dublin, 1828.

French philosopher of the Cartesian school, youngest child of Nicolas Malebranche, secretary to Louis the XIII; born August 6th at Paris. Deformed aud feeble, he was tutored aud subsequently studied theology at the Sorboune. In 1660 he joined the congregation of the Oratory. He was advised to study ecclesiastical history, but . . “the facts refused to arrange themselves, and mutually effaced each other”. In 1664 he read Descartes’ Traite de l’homme, which moved him deeply. For the next ten years he studied philosophy aud Descartes, which resulted in his famous De la reeherehe de la verite. Many other works followed, concerning themselves with mathematics aud natural philosophy, and in 1699 he was admitted as honorary member of the Academy of Sciences. He enjoyed much success aud was sought out in later years by men of distinction; engaging in a metaphysical argument with Bishop Berkeley hastened his death on 13 October, 1715. An edition of his works was published by Jules Simon in 1842, in 2 volumes. M ALPAS, P HILIP A LFRED. Born February 24, 1875 at Birch, Essex (Stanway District) England, son of J oseph Malpas, an Anglican curate there, and Mary Meuge. Little is known of his formative years, but his family background may have influenced his later researches. At age 18, he enlisted in H.M. Royal Navy, aud was ship’s clerk on a succession of 9 ships plying the world up to 1896. He then became assistant paymaster on 10 more until resigning his commission to the great regret of his captain on May 1, 1904. In that year, he met the Ponsonby family at Trinidad, showing them an album of photos of the Pt. Loma Theosophical Society, aud soon after, the two Ponsonby girls enrolled there. He then joined the Pt. Loma Society aud taught for the boys department in Horticulture aud Nature Studies, and began his career of writing by frequent contributions to The Century Path, and later to The Theosophical Path, and Raja Yoga Messenger for children. Seeing his natural penchant for scholarly research, Katherine Tingley suggested he take up residence at the London Branch for serious studies at the British Museum. Accordingly in about 1910, Malpas began nearly 20 years of uninterrupted research aud writing, with free run of the entire institution. He was supported primarily by the Branch Lodge until the financial difficulties of 1929 precluded his continuation there, and so moved to Essen, Germany as a private tutor in English, aud lecturer. He is shown as a member of the Fremdspracheclub in 1931. At about this time he formed a small group interested in theosophical studies, including Mary Linue, aud Emmi Hacinter, - 392 BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS [These two women were later jailed as enemies to Hitler’s 3rd Reich for translating the entire Secret Doctrine into German, which manuscript was burned along with their personal library.] Malpas con- tinued in Germany until 1939 when he was instrumental in helping several people of Jewish background defect to England. During the war, he was an instructor for Her Majesty’s Forces at London, aud in 1946, Col. Conger invited him to Theosophical Headquarters which by then had moved to Covina, California. From 1946 to 1950 he was at Covina, until Col. Conger’s death . . . when differences of opinion regarding leadership forced him to return to Germany. There, Mary Linne aud Emmi Hacinter were once again translating the Secret Doctrine into German, at Wirtemberg. Malpas passed away there on July 22, 1958 at the age of 83. His writings are ex’tremely voluminous, thus only an overview can be attempted here. Of articles in Pt. Loma journals between 1900 aud 1949, over 50 appear on every conceivable subject: some, such as ‘Apollonius of Tyana,’ ‘St. Germain,’ ‘Cagliostro,’ aud ‘Siddhartha Buddha,’ extending over several issues.

M EAD, G EORGE R OBERT S TOWE. Born at Nuneaton, March 22, 1863, son of Colonel Robert Mead, H . M. Ordnance, aud Mary. Educated at Rochester Cathedral school, (Mr. Laughoinne) aud St. John’s College, Cambridge, B.A., 1884, aud M.A., 1926. Shortly after graduating with honors, Mead joined the Theosophical Society, aud in the same year began teaching at a public school, 1884. He had begun the study of mathematics at Cambridge, but soon changed to the classics, gaining a knowledge of Greek and Latin, which was to be an asset in forthcoming years. About this time he read Esoteric Buddhism aud became associated with Bertram Keightlcy aud Mohini Chatteinji; then followed an intense interest in Hinduism, developed by studying philosophy at Ox’ford, aud curiosity regarding spiritualism causing a brief stay at a French university at Clermont-Feinraud. He first met H.P.B. in 1887: “When I first went to her to work permanently (1889), I was a young man of whom she practically knew nothing, except that from May, 1887 . . . when she returned to England for the last time, I spent no little of my holidays in visits to Maycott, Upper Norwood, aud to 17 Lansdownc Road, Bayswatcr. Nevertheless, with childlike confidence, aud with one of those large and eccentric gestures of hers, she handed over to me at once the keys of her desk aud bookcases and tossed over, unopened, her voluminous coinresponduce, bidding me answer it as best I might (and “be d--d”), as she wanted all her time for writing her articles and books . . . .“ Mead remained her private secretary for the last three years of her life, while in forming the European Section of the Theosophical Society, he was its General Secretary beginning July 9th, 1890. Within a year, H.P.B. had passed away, aud Mead in company with Annie Besant took over as editors of 394 B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS L ucifer, begun by H.P.B. in 1887. Besides his other duties, Mead’s career as an author began with his first publication, Simon Magus, an Essay, 1892. With Mrs. Besant he also edited a collection of H.P.B.’s miscellaneous papers, which was issued as “Volume III” of the Secret Doctrine, Adyar, 1897; Theosophical Glossary, 1892; Key to Theosophy, 3rd ed., 1893; Five Years of Theosophy, 2nd ed.,"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"1894; A Modern Panarion, 1895. Lucifer continued until 1898 (Vol. XXI) when it was succeeded by The Theosophical Review, edited solely by Mead. In 1899 he married Laura Mary Cooper, sister of Mrs. Cooper-Oakley (who authored The Corn ptc de St. Gcrmain), aud daughter of Frederick Cooper, I.C.S. She lived until 1924. Also during that period he was vice president aud later president of the Blavatsky Lodge, London. He continued to edit Theosophical Review, contributing many articles aud reviews, of the latter there were about 18 in Lucifer, aud 45 in T.R. About this time began the prominence of Mr. Leadheater as his many writings were published, aud increasing numbers were drawn into the society by his views, aud by his references to his “psychic” experiences, which views were not always shared by earlier members. At the beginning of 1906, grave charges were brought against C.W. Leadheater by several scandalized mothers in the U.S.A., whose young sons had been taught certain morally oblique practices. After a great deal of publicity aud legal action by the distraught mothers, a Judicial Committee was convened by Col. Oleott. The evidence being clear aud incontrovertible against Leadheatein, his resignation from the Theosophical Society was accepted to close the matter. In May, 1908, a new phase of the above-mentioned events cropped up, when Dr. Weller van Hook, General Secretary of the Amerlcan Section wrote an Open Letter to his Section defending Lead-beater’s position aud ideas. A large number of members in the then British Section were deeply concerned over the state of affairs, aud the Annual British Convention in July, 1908, carried a resolution requesting the President aud General Council of the T.S. to put an end once for all to this matter. After full deliberation, the President aud the Council saw no reason why Mr. Leadheater should not be restored to membership.” Whereupon upwards of 700 members in England resigned from the Society. Mend of course, was one of them. In a Valedictory published in the February, 1909, issue of The Theosophical Review, (No. 258) he bid farewell to his readers, as Editor of the Review, specifically stating that he had lost confidence in the President aud its chief Officials. B IBLIOGRAPHY 3 95 About 150 of the dissidents aud some 100 others who approved, joined together to found the Quest Society aud to publish a new journal with the title of The Quest. The Quest, a quarterly review, began in October 1909, aud continued with Mead as editor until it ceased publication in 1930. It attracted many serious scholars who contributed valuable articles considered as source material today. Mead carried on these activities despite severe financial difficulties for 21 years, finding time to work for the welfare of Indian students as Secretary of the Northbrook Society. The financial reverses of 1929/30 spelled an end to the Quest Society, but he became active in the newly formed Society for Promoting the Study of Religions, becoming a member of its council. His last public appearance was at a meeting of The Royal Asiatic Society, where he delivered a lecture on the Mandacans, a subject with which he was on the most intimate terms, as shown by the many articles appearing in Quest. He died September 29th, 1933 at the age of 65, after returning from a holiday in bad health. Of all the members of the Theosophical movement throughout the years, G. R. S. Mead was one of the few true scholars to emerge. His studies bearing upon’ the origins of Christianity constitute the only real bridge between early Gnosticism aud the philosophy of the Mandacans, with what has come to be called “Christianity” in this century. A collection of all of his works would fill several volumes, aud provide students with an invaluable aid for research. John M. Watkins, his literary executor found no papers in his estate. Some of the chapters on various subjects contained in Mead’s published works appeared at first in one or another of the magazines of which he was the Editor. After some editing, revising aud some- times augmenting the text, they were incorporated into the MSS. of his published works. The list of the latter is quite imposing.

Author of Catechism published in 1645 at Kieff, aud other minor works. He is chiefly remembered for his Orthodox Confession, drawn up at the behest of Abbot Kosslowski of Kieff, aud approved by the pro. vincial synod 1640, aud later by the synod of Jerusalem 1672. During Mogila’s time the reform movement of the Calvinistic Cyril Lucanis (Patriarch of Alexandria aud Constantinople 1601-1621) generated intrigue by opposing Jesuits, by whose agency he was 5 times BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS398 deposed but reinstated. Finally, the Church anathematized his doctrines, aud he was murdered by Turks hired by the Jesuits. Chief testimony against him was the Orthodox Confession which formed much of the basis of the Russian Orthodox catechisms seen today. Editions of the Orthodox Confession: edited by Panagiotes in Greek aud Latin, Amsterdam, 1662; by Hofmanu, Leipsic, 1695; Kimmel, Jena, 1843; Greek translation by Johanne L. Fniseb, Frankfurt, 1727. M LLER, G EORGE. English preacher aud philanthropist, born near Halberstadt, Germany, September 27, 1 805; died at Bristol, March 10, 1898. In 1830, he became minister of a small congregation at Tiegn. mouth, Devonshire. His contention was that the temporal as well as the spiritual needs of life could be supplied by prayer, aud on this principle abolished pew rents aud refused to take a fixed salary. Two years later, he moved to Bristol where he spent the rest of his life, devoting himself especially to the care of orphan children. In time, their number grew to 2,000, settled in five large houses at Ashley Down, near Bristol, aud supported by voluntary contributions. Miillcr wrote a curious little narrative called The Lord’s Deal-hugs with George MIller. When he was seventy, he started on a preaching mission, which lasted over 17 years aud took him all over the world. All in all, he was a veiny remarkable man leading the spiritual life.

He was secretary to the imperial commissaries at the second Council of Nicaca in 787, where his view prevailed. He later retired for awhile into a convent, but very suddenly succeeded Tarasius as Patriarch of Constantinople in 806. He was deposed by Emperor Leo V in 815 aud died in exile, 827. His works are esteemed for their intrinsic value aud their style.

P ALINGENIO S TELLATO, M ARCELLO. Italian author whose actual name was Pier Angelo Mauzoli. H e was born at La Stellata at about 1503, aud died in 1543. His didactic poem titled *Zodiacus vitae: hoe est de hominis vita, studio ac monibus optime instituendes, aud published about 1534, was dedicated to Hercules II of Ferrara; it combines metaphysical speculation with satirical attacks on ecclesiastical hypocrisy, especially on the Pope aud on Luther. It was of course banned by the Inquisition. English transl. by Baruabe Googe, London, 1561, as The Zodiake of Lyfe. PAUL OF SAMOSATA. Patriarch of Antioch, 260.272 A.D., most likely of humble origin. Information concerning him is derived mainly from the encyclical letter of his ecclesiastical opponents (in Eusebius’ History, Bk. VII, ch. 30), seventy of whom deposed Paul after the synod of Antioch in 269; their sentence did not take effect, however, until late in 272, when Emperor Aurelian installed the rival candidate Domnus in the place of Paul. Paul held that it was a man aud not the divine Logos which was born of Mary. Jesus was a man who came to be God, rather than God become man. This was the idea of the early Ebionites aud of some of the doctors of the Syrian Church of the 4th aud 5th centuries. Lucian, the great exegete of Antioch aud his school derived of their inspiration from Paul, aud he was through Lucian a forefather of Anianism. The sect of the Paulicians also owe some of their ideas to Paul of Samosata. The fanaticism of his contemporaries aud succeeding generations left us nothing but a few fragments of his writings, which apparently contained some true mysticism.
