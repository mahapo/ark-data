Blavatsky was born August 12th 1831 in Yekaterinoslav, Russia. Afterleaving Russia after an unconsummated arranged marriage, Helena became aprolific world traveler. She traveled the world with her second husband, HenrySteel Olcott, visiting Egypt, France, Germany, Mexico, South America, Canada,before settling in Madras, India. There, she founded the Theosophical Society. Theosophy's all-encompassingworldview proposes explanations for the origin, workings and ultimate fate ofthe whole of Existence. Isis Unveiled, published in 1877, is a book of esoteric philosophy, and wasBlavatsky's first major work. The book discusses or quotes, among others, Plato , the Chaldean Oracles, theEgyptian Book of the Dead, the Bible, Pythagoras, Apollonius of Tyana, the PopolVuh, Paracelsus, Giordano Bruno, Marco Polo, Jesus the Nazarene, SiddhārthaGautama, Zoroaster and Max Müller, as well as Buddhist , Brahmanical, Chinese,Persian, Babylonian, Chaldean, Syrian, Gnostic, Egyptian literature and muchmore. It is composed of two volumes, the first concentrating on science, and thesecond on religion. This edition is specially formatted, includes the original illustrations, and aTable of Contents.

CHAPTER I.\"Ego sum qui sum.\"--An axiom of Hermetic Philosophy.\"We commenced research where modern conjecture closes its faithless wings. Andwith us, those were the common elements of science which the sages of to-daydisdain as wild chimeras, or despair of as unfathomable mysteries.\"--BULWER'S\"ZANONI.\"THERE exists somewhere in this wide world an old Book--so very old that ourmodern antiquarians might ponder over its pages an indefinite time, and stillnot quite agree as to the nature of the fabric upon which it is written. It isthe only original copy now in existence. The most ancient Hebrew document onoccult learning--the Siphra Dzeniouta--was compiled from it, and that at a timewhen the former was already considered in the light of a literary relic. One ofits illustrations represents the Divine Essence emanating from ADAM * like aluminous arc proceeding to form a circle; and then, having attained the highestpoint of its circumference, the ineffable Glory bends back again, and returns toearth, bringing a higher type of humanity in its vortex. As it approaches nearerand nearer to our planet, the Emanation becomes more and more shadowy, untilupon touching the ground it is as black as night. A conviction, founded upon seventy thousand years of experience, ** as theyallege, has been entertained by hermetic philosophers of all periods that matterhas in time become, through sin, more gross and dense than it was at man's firstformation; that, at the beginning, the human body was of a half-ethereal nature;and that, before the fall, mankind communed freely with the now unseenuniverses. But since that time matter has become the formidable barrier betweenus and the world of spirits. The oldest esoteric traditions also teach that,before the mystic Adam, many races of human beings lived and died out, eachgiving place in its turn to another. Were these precedent types more perfect?Did any of them belong to the winged race of men mentioned by Plato in Phaedrus?It is the special province of science to solve the problem. The caves of Franceand the relics of the stone age afford a point at which to begin. As the cycle proceeded, man's eyes were more and more opened, until he came toknow \"good and evil\" as well as the Elohim themselves. Having reached itssummit, the cycle began to go downward. When the arc attained a certain pointwhich brought it parallel with the fixed line of our terrestrial plane, the manwas furnished by nature with \"coats of skin,\" and the Lord God \"clothed them.\" This same belief in the pre-existence of a far more spiritual race than the oneto which we now belong can be traced back to the earliest traditions of nearlyevery people. In the ancient Quiche manuscript, published by Brasseur deBourbourg--the Popol Vuh--the first men are mentioned as a race that couldreason and speak, whose sight was unlimited, and who knew all things at once.According to Philo Judaeus, the air is filled with an invisible host of spirits,some of whom are free from evil and immortal, and others are pernicious andmortal. \"From the sons of EL we are descended, and sons of EL must we becomeagain.\" And the unequivocal statement of the anonymous Gnostic who wrote TheGospel according to John, that \"as many as received Him,\" i.e., who followedpractically the esoteric doctrine of Jesus, would \"become the sons of God,\"points to the same belief. (i., 12.) \"Know ye not, ye are gods?\" exclaimed theMaster. Plato describes admirably in Phaedrus the state in which man once was,and what he will become again: before, and after the \"loss of his wings\"; when\"he lived among the gods, a god himself in the airy world.\" From the remotestperiods religious philosophies taught that the whole universe was filled withdivine and spiritual beings of divers races. From one of these evolved, in thecourse of time, ADAM, the primitive man. The Kalmucks and some tribes of Siberia also describe in their legends earliercreations than our present race. These beings, they say, were possessed ofalmost boundless knowledge, and in their audacity even threatened rebellionagainst the Great Chief Spirit. To punish their presumption and humble them, heimprisoned them in bodies, and so shut in their senses. From these they canescape but through long repentance, self-purification, and development. TheirShamans, they think, occasionally enjoy the divine powers originally possessedby all human beings. The Astor Library of New York has recently been enriched by a facsimile of anEgyptian Medical Treatise, written in the sixteenth century B.C. (or, moreprecisely, 1552 B.C.), which, according to the commonly received chronology, isthe time when Moses was just twenty-one years of age. The original is writtenupon the inner bark of Cyperus papyrus, and has been pronounced by ProfessorSchenk, of Leipsig, not only genuine, but also the most perfect ever seen. Itconsists of a single sheet of yellow-brown papyrus of finest quality,three-tenths of a metre wide, more than twenty metres long, and forming one rolldivided into one hundred and ten pages, all carefully numbered. It was purchasedin Egypt, in 1872-3, by the archaeologist Ebers, of \"a well-to-do Arab fromLuxor.\" The New York Tribune, commenting upon the circumstance, says: Thepapyrus \"bears internal evidence of being one of the six Hermetic Books onMedicine, named by Clement of Alexandria.\" The editor further says: \"At the time of Iamblichus, A.D. 363, the priests ofEgypt showed forty-two books which they attributed to Hermes (Thuti). Of these,according to that author, thirty-six contained the history of all humanknowledge; the last six treated of anatomy, of pathology, of affections of theeye, instruments of surgery, and of medicines. * The Papyrus Ebers isindisputably one of these ancient Hermetic works.\" If so clear a ray of light has been thrown upon ancient Egyptian science, by theaccidental (?) encounter of the German archaeologist with one \"well-to-do Arab\"from Luxor, how can we know what sunshine may be let in upon the dark crypts ofhistory by an equally accidental meeting between some other prosperous Egyptianand another enterprising student of antiquity! The discoveries of modern science do not disagree with the oldest traditionswhich claim an incredible antiquity for our race. Within the last few yearsgeology, which previously had only conceded that man could be traced as far backas the tertiary period, has found unanswerable proofs that human existenceantedates the last glaciation of Europe--over 250,000 years! A hard nut, this,for Patristic Theology to crack; but an accepted fact with the ancientphilosophers. Moreover, fossil implements have been exhumed together with human remains, whichshow that man hunted in those remote times, and knew how to build a fire. Butthe forward step has not yet been taken in this search for the origin of therace; science comes to a dead stop, and waits for future proofs. Unfortunately,anthropology and psychology possess no Cuvier; neither geologists norarchaeologists are able to construct, from the fragmentary bits hithertodiscovered, the perfect skeleton of the triple man--physical, intellectual, andspiritual. Because the fossil implements of man are found to become more roughand uncouth as geology penetrates deeper into the bowels of the earth, it seemsa proof to science that the closer we come to the origin of man, the more savageand brute-like he must be. Strange logic! Does the finding of the remains in thecave of Devon prove that there were no contemporary races then who were highlycivilized? When the present population of the earth have disappeared, and somearchaeologist belonging to the \"coming race\" of the distant future shallexcavate the domestic implements of one of our Indian or Andaman Island tribes,will he be justified in concluding that mankind in the nineteenth century was\"just emerging from the Stone Age\"? It has lately been the fashion to speak of \"the untenable conceptions of anuncultivated past.\" As though it were possible to hide behind an epigram theintellectual quarries out of which the reputations of so many modernphilosophers have been carved! Just as Tyndall is ever ready to disparageancient philosophers--for a dressing-up of whose ideas more than onedistinguished scientist has derived honor and credit--so the geologists seemmore and more inclined to take for granted that all of the archaic races werecontemporaneously in a state of dense barbarism. But not all of our bestauthorities agree in this opinion. Some of the most eminent maintain exactly thereverse. Max Muller, for instance, says: \"Many things are still unintelligibleto us, and the hieroglyphic language of antiquity records but half of the mind'sunconscious intentions. Yet more and more the image of man, in whatever clime wemeet him, rises before us, noble and pure from the very beginning; even hiserrors we learn to understand, even his dreams we begin to interpret. As far aswe can trace back the footsteps of man, even on the lowest strata of history, wesee the divine gift of a sound and sober intellect belonging to him from thevery first, and the idea of a humanity emerging slowly from the depths of ananimal brutality can never be maintained again.\" * As it is claimed to be unphilosophical to inquire into first causes, scientistsnow occupy themselves with considering their physical effects. The field ofscientific investigation is therefore bounded by physical nature. When once itslimits are reached, enquiry must stop, and their work be recommenced. With alldue respect to our learned men, they are like the squirrel upon its revolvingwheel, for they are doomed to turn their \"matter\" over and over again. Scienceis a mighty potency, and it is not for us pigmies to question her. But the\"scientists\" are not themselves science embodied any more than the men of ourplanet are the planet itself. We have neither the right to demand, nor power tocompel our \"modern-day philosopher\" to accept without challenge a geographicaldescription of the dark side of the moon. But, if in some lunar cataclysm one ofher inhabitants should be hurled thence into the attraction of our atmosphere,and land, safe and sound, at Dr. Carpenter's door, he would be indictable asrecreant to professional duty if he should fail to set the physical problem atrest. For a man of science to refuse an opportunity to investigate any new phenomenon,whether it comes to him in the shape of a man from the moon, or a ghost from theEddy homestead, is alike reprehensible. Whether arrived at by the method of Aristotle, or that of Plato, we need notstop to inquire; but it is a fact that both the inner and outer natures of manare claimed to have been thoroughly understood by the ancient andrologists.Notwithstanding the superficial hypotheses of geologists, we are beginning tohave almost daily proofs in corroboration of the assertions of thosephilosophers. They divided the interminable periods of human existence on this planet intocycles, during each of which mankind gradually reached the culminating point ofhighest civilization and gradually relapsed into abject barbarism. To whateminence the race in its progress had several times arrived may be feeblysurmised by the wonderful monuments of old, still visible, and the descriptionsgiven by Herodotus of other marvels of which no traces now remain. Even in hisdays the gigantic structures of many pyramids and world-famous temples were butmasses of ruins. Scattered by the unrelenting hand of time, they are describedby the Father of History as \"these venerable witnesses of the long bygone gloryof departed ancestors.\" He \"shrinks from speaking of divine things,\" and givesto posterity but an imperfect description from hearsay of some marvelloussubterranean chambers of the Labyrinth, where lay--and now lie--concealed, thesacred remains of the King-Initiates. We can judge, moreover, of the lofty civilization reached in some periods ofantiquity by the historical descriptions of the ages of the Ptolemies, yet inthat epoch the arts and sciences were considered to be degenerating, and thesecret of a number of the former had been already lost. In the recentexcavations of Mariette-Bey, at the foot of the Pyramids, statues of wood andother relics have been exhumed, which show that long before the period of thefirst dynasties the Egyptians had attained to a refinement and perfection whichis calculated to excite the wonder of even the most ardent admirers of Grecianart. Bayard Taylor describes these statues in one of his lectures, and tells usthat the beauty of the heads, ornamented with eyes of precious stones and coppereyelids, is unsurpassed. Far below the stratum of sand in which lay the remainsgathered into the collections of Lepsius, Abbott, and the British Museum, werefound buried the tangible proofs of the hermetic doctrine of cycles which hasbeen already explained. Dr. Schliemann, the enthusiastic Hellenist, has recently found, in hisexcavations in the Troad, abundant evidences of the same gradual change frombarbarism to civilization, and from civilization to barbarism again. Why thenshould we feel so reluctant to admit the possibility that, if the antediluvianswere so much better versed than ourselves in certain sciences as to have beenperfectly acquainted with important arts, which we now term lost, they mighthave equally excelled in psychological knowledge? Such a hypothesis must beconsidered as reasonable as any other until some countervailing evidence shallbe discovered to destroy it. Every true savant admits that in many respects human knowledge is yet in itsinfancy. Can it be that our cycle began in ages comparatively recent? Thesecycles, according to the Chaldean philosophy, do not embrace all mankind at oneand the same time. Professor Draper partially corroborates this view by sayingthat the periods into which geology has \"found it convenient to divide theprogress of man in civilization are not abrupt epochs which hold goodsimultaneously for the whole human race\"; giving as an instance the \"wanderingIndians of America,\" who \"are only at the present moment emerging from the stoneage.\" Thus more than once scientific men have unwittingly confirmed thetestimony of the ancients. Any Kabalist well acquainted with the Pythagorean system of numerals andgeometry can demonstrate that the metaphysical views of Plato were based uponthe strictest mathematical principles. \"True mathematics,\" says the Magicon, \"issomething with which all higher sciences are connected; common mathematics isbut a deceitful phantasmagoria, whose much-praised infallibility only arisesfrom this—that materials, conditions, and references are made its foundation.\"Scientists who believe they have adopted the Aristotelian method only becausethey creep when they do not run from demonstrated particulars to universals,glorify this method of inductive philosophy, and reject that of Plato, whichthey treat as unsubstantial. Professor Draper laments that such speculativemystics as Ammonius Saccas and Plotinus should have taken the place \"of thesevere geometers of the old museum.\" * He forgets that geometry, of all sciencesthe only one which proceeds from universals to particulars, was precisely themethod employed by Plato in his philosophy. As long as exact science confinesits observations to physical conditions and proceeds Aristotle-like, itcertainly cannot fail. But notwithstanding that the world of matter is boundlessfor us, it still is finite; and thus materialism will turn forever in thisvitiated circle, unable to soar higher than the circumference will permit. Thecosmological theory of numerals which Pythagoras learned from the Egyptianhierophants, is alone able to reconcile the two units, matter and spirit, andcause each to demonstrate the other mathematically. The sacred numbers of the universe in their esoteric combination solve the greatproblem and explain the theory of radiation and the cycle of the emanations. Thelower orders before they develop into higher ones must emanate from the higherspiritual ones, and when arrived at the turning-point, be reabsorbed again intothe infinite. Physiology, like everything else in this world of constant evolution, is subjectto the cyclic revolution. As it now seems to be hardly emerging from the shadowsof the lower arc, so it may be one day proved to have been at the highest pointof the circumference of the circle far earlier than the days of Pythagoras. Mochus, the Sidonian, the physiologist and teacher of the science of anatomy,flourished long before the Sage of Samos; and the latter received the sacredinstructions from his disciples and descendants. Pythagoras, the purephilosopher, the deeply-versed in the profounder phenomena of nature, the nobleinheritor of the ancient lore, whose great aim was to free the soul from thefetters of sense and force it to realize its powers, must live eternally inhuman memory. The impenetrable veil of arcane secrecy was thrown over the sciences taught inthe sanctuary. This is the cause of the modern depreciating of the ancientphilosophies. Even Plato and Philo Judaeus have been accused by many acommentator of absurd inconsistencies, whereas the design which underlies themaze of metaphysical contradictions so perplexing to the reader of the Timaeus,is but too evident. But has Plato ever been read understandingly by one of theexpounders of the classics? This is a question warranted by the criticisms to befound in such authors as Stalbaum, Schleirmacher, Ficinus (Latin translation),Heindorf, Sydenham, Buttmann, Taylor and Burges, to say nothing of lesserauthorities. The covert allusions of the Greek philosopher to esoteric thingshave manifestly baffled these commentators to the last degree. They not onlywith unblushing coolness suggest as to certain difficult passages that anotherphraseology was evidently intended, but they audaciously make the changes! TheOrphic line: \"Of the song, the order of the sixth race close\" --which can only be interpreted as a reference to the sixth race evolved in theconsecutive evolution of the spheres, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_5] Burges says: \". . . wasevidently taken from a cosmogony where man was feigned to be created thelast.\" **--Ought not one who undertakes to edit another's works at leastunderstand what his author means? Indeed, the ancient philosophers seem to be generally held, even by the leastprejudiced of our modern critics, to have lacked that profundity and thoroughknowledge in the exact sciences of which our century is so boastful. It is evenquestioned whether they understood that basic scientific principle: ex nihilonihil fit. If they suspected the indestructibility of matter at all,--say thesecommentators--it was not in consequence of a firmly-established formula but onlythrough an intuitional reasoning and by analogy. We hold to the contrary opinion. The speculations of these philosophers uponmatter were open to public criticism: but their teachings in regard to spiritualthings were profoundly esoteric. Being thus sworn to secrecy and religioussilence upon abstruse subjects involving the relations of spirit and matter,they rivalled each other in their ingenious methods for concealing their realopinions. The doctrine of Metempsychosis has been abundantly ridiculed by men of scienceand rejected by theologians, yet if it had been properly understood in itsapplication to the indestructibility of matter and the immortality of spirit, itwould have been perceived that it is a sublime conception. Should we not firstregard the subject from the stand-point of the ancients before venturing todisparage its teachers? The solution of the great problem of eternity belongsneither to religious superstition nor to gross materialism. The harmony andmathematical equiformity of the double evolution--spiritual and physical--areelucidated only in the universal numerals of Pythagoras, who built his systementirely upon the so-called \"metrical speech\" of the Hindu Vedas. It is butlately that one of the most zealous Sanskrit scholars, Martin Haug, undertookthe translation of the Aitareya Brahmana of the Rig-Veda. It had been till thattime entirely unknown; these explanations indicate beyond dispute the identityof the Pythagorean and Brahmanical systems. In both, the esoteric significanceis derived from the number: in the former, from the mystic relation of everynumber to everything intelligible to the human mind; in the latter, from thenumber of syllables of which each verse in the Mantras consists. Plato, theardent disciple of Pythagoras, realized it so fully as to maintain that theDodecahedron was the geometrical figure employed by the Demiurgus inconstructing the universe. Some of these figures had a peculiarly solemnsignificance. For instance four, of which the Dodecahedron is the trine, washeld sacred by the Pythagoreans. It is the perfect square, and neither of thebounding lines exceeds the other in length, by a single point. It is the emblemof moral justice and divine equity geometrically expressed. All the powers andgreat symphonies of physical and spiritual nature lie inscribed within theperfect square; and the ineffable name of Him, which name otherwise, wouldremain unutterable, was replaced by this sacred number 4 the most binding andsolemn oath with the ancient mystics--the Tetractys. If the Pythagorean metempsychosis should be thoroughly explained and comparedwith the modern theory of evolution, it would be found to supply every \"missinglink\" in the chain of the latter. But who of our scientists would consent tolose his precious time over the vagaries of the ancients. Notwithstanding proofsto the contrary, they not only deny that the nations of the archaic periods, buteven the ancient philosophers had any positive knowledge of the Heliocentricsystem. The \"Venerable Bedes,\" the Augustines and Lactantii appear to havesmothered, with their dogmatic ignorance, all faith in the more ancienttheologists of the pre-Christian centuries. But now philology and a closeracquaintance with Sanskrit literature have partially enabled us to vindicatethem from these unmerited imputations. In the Vedas, for instance, we findpositive proof that so long ago as 2000 B.C., the Hindu sages and scholars musthave been acquainted with the rotundity of our globe and the Heliocentricsystem. Hence, Pythagoras and Plato knew well this astronomical truth; forPythagoras obtained his knowledge in India, or from men who had been there, andPlato faithfully echoed his teachings. We will quote two passages from theAitareya Brahmana: In the \"Serpent-Mantra,\" * the Brahmana declares as follows: that this Mantra isthat one which was seen by the Queen of the Serpents, Sarpa-rajni; because theearth (iyam) is the Queen of the Serpents, as she is the mother and queen of allthat moves (sarpat). In the beginning she (the earth) was but one head (round),without hair (bald), i.e., without vegetation. She then perceived this Mantrawhich confers upon him who knows it, the power of assuming any form which hemight desire. She \"pronounced the Mantra,\" i.e., sacrificed to the gods; and, inconsequence, immediately obtained a motley appearance; she became variegated,and able to produce any form she might like, changing one form into another.This Mantra begins with the words: \"Ayam gauh pris'nir akramit\" (x., 189). The description of the earth in the shape of a round and bald head, which wassoft at first, and became hard only from being breathed upon by the god Vayu,the lord of the air, forcibly suggests the idea that the authors of the sacredVedic books knew the earth to be round or spherical; moreover, that it had beena gelatinous mass at first, which gradually cooled off under the influence ofthe air and time. So much for their knowledge about our globe's sphericity; andnow we will present the testimony upon which we base our assertion, that theHindus were perfectly acquainted with the Heliocentric system, at least 2000years B.C. In the same treatise the Hotar, (priest), is taught how the Shastras should berepeated, and how the phenomena of sunrise and sunset are to be explained. Itsays: \"The Agnishtoma is that one (that god) who burns. The sun never sets norrises. When people think the sun is setting, it is not so; they are mistaken.For after having arrived at the end of the day, it produces two oppositeeffects, making night to what is below, and day to what is on the other side.When they (the people) believe it rises in the morning, the sun only does thus:having reached the end of the night, it makes itself produce two oppositeeffects, making day to what is below, and night to what is on the other side. Infact the sun never sets; nor does it set for him who has such a knowledge. . ..\" ** This sentence is so conclusive, that even the translator of the Rig-Veda, Dr.Haug, was forced to remark it. He says this passage contains \"the denial of theexistence of sunrise and sunset,\" and that the author supposes the sun \"toremain always in its high position.\" *** In one of the earliest Nivids, Rishi Kutsa, a Hindu sage of the remotestantiquity, explains the allegory of the first laws given to the celestialbodies. For doing \"what she ought not to do,\" Anahit (Anaitis or Nana, thePersian Venus), representing the earth in the legend, is sentenced to turn roundthe sun. The Sattras, or sacrificial sessions *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_10] prove undoubtedly that soearly as in the eighteenth or twentieth century B.C., the Hindus had madeconsiderable progress in astronomical science. The Sattras lasted one year, andwere \"nothing but an imitation of the sun's yearly course. They were divided,says Haug, into two distinct parts, each consisting of six months of thirty dayseach; in the midst of both was the Vishuvan (equator or central day), cuttingthe whole Sattras into two halves, etc.\" ** This scholar, although he ascribesthe composition of the bulk of the Brahmanas to the period 1400-1200 B.C., is ofopinion that the oldest of the hymns may be placed at the very commencement ofVedic literature, between the years 2400-2000, B.C. He finds no reason forconsidering the Vedas less ancient than the sacred books of the Chinese. As theShu-King or Book of History, and the sacrificial songs of the Shi-King, or Bookof Odes, have been proved to have an antiquity as early as 2200, B.C., ourphilologists may yet be compelled before long to acknowledge, that inastronomical knowledge, the antediluvian Hindus were their masters. At all events, there are facts which prove that certain astronomicalcalculations were as correct with the Chaldeans in the days of Julius Caesar asthey are now. When the calendar was reformed by the Conqueror, the civil yearwas found to correspond so little with the seasons, that summer had merged intothe autumn months, and the autumn months into full winter. It was Sosigenes, theChaldean astronomer, who restored order into the confusion, by putting back the25th of March ninety days, thus making it correspond with the vernal equinox;and it was Sosigenes, again, who fixed the lengths of the months as they nowremain. In America, it was found by the Montezuman army, that the calendar of the Aztecsgave an equal number of days and weeks to each month. The extreme accuracy oftheir astronomical calculations was so great, that no error has been discoveredin their reckoning by subsequent verifications; while the Europeans, who landedin Mexico in 1519, were, by the Julian calendar, nearly eleven days in advanceof the exact time. It is to the priceless and accurate translations of the Vedic Books, and to thepersonal researches of Dr. Haug, that we are indebted for the corroboration ofthe claims of the hermetic philosophers. That the period of Zarathustra Spitama(Zoroaster) was of untold antiquity, can be easily proved. The Brahmanas, towhich Haug ascribes four thousand years, describe the religious contest betweenthe ancient Hindus, who lived in the pre-Vedic period, and the Iranians. Thebattles between the Devas and the Asuras--the former representing the Hindus andthe latter the Iranians--are described at length in the sacred books. As theIranian prophet was the first to raise himself against what he called the\"idolatry\" of the Brahmans, and to designate them as the Devas (devils), how farback must then have been this religious crisis? \"This contest,\" answers Dr. Haug, \"must have appeared to the authors of theBrahmanas as old as the feats of King Arthur appear to English writers of thenineteenth century.\" There was not a philosopher of any notoriety who did not hold to this doctrineof metempsychosis, as taught by the Brahmans, Buddhists, and later by thePythagoreans, in its esoteric sense, whether he expressed it more or lessintelligibly. Origen and Clemens Alexandrinus, Synesius and Chalcidius, allbelieved in it; and the Gnostics, who are unhesitatingly proclaimed by historyas a body of the most refined, learned, and enlightened men, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_12] were all believers inmetempsychosis. Socrates entertained opinions identical with those ofPythagoras; and both, as the penalty of their divine philosophy, were put to aviolent death. The rabble has been the same in all ages. Materialism has been,and will ever be blind to spiritual truths. These philosophers held, with theHindus, that God had infused into matter a portion of his own Divine Spirit,which animates and moves every particle. They taught that men have two souls, ofseparate and quite different natures: the one perishable--the Astral Soul, orthe inner, fluidic body--the other incorruptible and immortal--the Augoeides, orportion of the Divine Spirit; that the mortal or Astral Soul perishes at eachgradual change at the threshold of every new sphere, becoming with everytransmigration more purified. The astral man, intangible and invisible as hemight be to our mortal, earthly senses, is still constituted of matter, thoughsublimated. Aristotle, notwithstanding that for political reasons of his own hemaintained a prudent silence as to certain esoteric matters, expressed veryclearly his opinion on the subject. It was his belief that human souls areemanations of God, that are finally re-absorbed into Divinity. Zeno, the founderof the Stoics, taught that there are \"two eternal qualities throughout nature:the one active, or male; the other passive, or female: that the former is pure,subtile ether, or Divine Spirit; the other entirely inert in itself till unitedwith the active principle. That the Divine Spirit acting upon matter producedfire, water, earth, and air; and that it is the sole efficient principle bywhich all nature is moved. The Stoics, like the Hindu sages, believed in thefinal absorption. St. Justin believed in the emanation of these souls fromDivinity, and Tatian, the Assyrian, his disciple, declared that \"man was asimmortal as God himself.\" * That profoundly significant verse of the Genesis, \"And to every beast of theearth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon theearth, I gave a living soul, . . . .\" should arrest the attention of everyHebrew scholar capable of reading the Scripture in its original, instead offollowing the erroneous translation, in which the phrase reads, \"wherein thereis life.\" ** From the first to the last chapters, the translators of the Jewish Sacred Booksmisconstrued this meaning. They have even changed the spelling of the name ofGod, as Sir W. Drummond proves. Thus El, if written correctly, would read Al,for it stands in the original אל--Al, and, according to Higgins, this word meansthe god Mithra, the Sun, the preserver and savior. Sir W. Drummond shows thatBeth-El means the House of the Sun in its literal translation, and not of God.\"El, in the composition of these Canaanite names, does not signify Deus, butSol.\" *** Thus Theology has disfigured ancient Theosophy, and Science ancientPhilosophy. **** For lack of comprehension of this great philosophical principle, the methods ofmodern science, however exact, must end in nullity. In no one branch can itdemonstrate the origin and ultimate of things. Instead of tracing the effectfrom its primal source, its progress is the reverse. Its higher types, as itteaches, are all evolved from antecedent lower ones. It starts from the bottomof the cycle, led on step by step in the great labyrinth of nature by a threadof matter. As soon as this breaks and the clue is lost, it recoils in affrightfrom the Incomprehensible, and confesses itself powerless. Not so did Plato andhis disciples. With him the lower types were but the concrete images of thehigher abstract ones. The soul, which is immortal, has an arithmetical, as thebody has a geometrical, beginning. This beginning, as the reflection of thegreat universal ARCHÆUS, is self-moving, and from the centre diffuses itselfover the whole body of the microcosm. It was the sad perception of this truth that made Tyndall confess how powerlessis science, even over the world of matter. \"The first marshalling of the atoms,on which all subsequent action depends, baffles a keener power than that of themicroscope.\" \"Through pure excess of complexity, and long before observation canhave any voice in the matter, the most highly trained intellect, the mostrefined and disciplined imagination, retires in bewilderment from thecontemplation of the problem. We are struck dumb by an astonishment which nomicroscope can relieve, doubting not only the power of our instrument, but evenwhether we ourselves possess the intellectual elements which will ever enable usto grapple with the ultimate structural energies of nature.\" The fundamental geometrical figure of the Kabala--that figure which traditionand the esoteric doctrines tell us was given by the Deity itself to Moses onMount Sinai * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_17]--contains inits grandiose, because simple combination, the key to the universal problem.This figure contains in itself all the others. For those who are able to masterit, there is no need to exercise imagination. No earthly microscope can becompared with the keenness of the spiritual perception. And even for those who are unacquainted with the GREAT SCIENCE, the descriptiongiven by a well-trained child-psychometer of the genesis of a grain, a fragmentof crystal, or any other object--is worth all the telescopes and microscopes of\"exact science.\" There may be more truth in the adventurous pangenesis of Darwin--whom Tyndallcalls a \"soaring speculator\"--than in the cautious, line-bound hypothesis of thelatter; who, in common with other thinkers of his class, surrounds hisimagination \"by the firm frontiers of reason.\" The theory of a microscopic germwhich contains in itself \"a world of minor germs,\" soars in one sense at leastinto the infinite. It oversteps the world of matter, and begins unconsciouslybusying itself in the world of spirit. If we accept Darwin's theory of the development of species, we find that hisstarting-point is placed in front of an open door. We are at liberty with him,to either remain within, or cross the threshold, beyond which lies the limitlessand the incomprehensible, or rather the Unutterable. If our mortal language isinadequate to express what our spirit dimly foresees in the great\"Beyond\"--while on this earth--it must realize it at some point in the timelessEternity. Not so with Professor Huxley's theory of the \"Physical Basis of Life.\"Regardless of the formidable majority of \"nays\" from his Germanbrother-scientists, he creates a universal protoplasm and appoints its cells tobecome henceforth the sacred founts of the principle of all life. By making thelatter identical in living man, \"dead mutton,\" a nettle-sting, and a lobster; byshutting in, in the molecular cell of the protoplasm, the life-principle, and byshutting out from it the divine influx which comes with subsequent evolution, hecloses every door against any possible escape. Like an able tactician heconverts his \"laws and facts\" into sentries whom he causes to mount guard overevery issue. The standard under which he rallies them is inscribed with the word\"necessity\"; but hardly is it unfurled when he mocks the legend and calls it \"anempty shadow of my own imagination.\" * The fundamental doctrines of spiritualism, he says, \"lie outside the limits ofphilosophical inquiry.\" We will be bold enough to contradict this assertion, andsay that they lie a great deal more within such inquiry than Mr. Huxley'sprotoplasm. Insomuch that they present evident and palpable facts of theexistence of spirit, and the protoplasmic cells, once dead, present nonewhatever of being the originators or the bases of life, as this one of the few\"foremost thinkers of the day\" wants us to believe. ** The ancient Kabalist rested upon no hypothesis till he could lay its basis uponthe firm rock of recorded experiment. But the too great dependence upon physical facts led to a growth of materialismand a decadence of spirituality and faith. At the time of Aristotle, this wasthe prevailing tendency of thought. And though the Delphic commandment was notas yet completely eliminated from Grecian thought; and some philosophers stillheld that \"in order to know what man is, we ought to know what man was\"--stillmaterialism had already begun to gnaw at the root of faith. The Mysteriesthemselves had degenerated in a very great degree into mere priestlyspeculations and religious fraud. Few were the true adepts and initiates, theheirs and descendants of those who had been dispersed by the conquering swordsof various invaders of Old Egypt. The time predicted by the great Hermes in his dialogue with &Ælig;sculapius hadindeed come; the time when impious foreigners would accuse Egypt of adoringmonsters, and naught but the letters engraved in stone upon her monuments wouldsurvive--enigmas incredible to posterity. Their sacred scribes and hierophantswere wanderers upon the face of the earth. Obliged from fear of a profanation ofthe sacred mysteries to seek refuge among the Hermetic fraternities--known lateras the Essenes--their esoteric knowledge was buried deeper than ever. Thetriumphant brand of Aristotle's pupil swept away from his path of conquest everyvestige of a once pure religion, and Aristotle himself, the type and child ofhis epoch, though instructed in the secret science of the Egyptians, knew butlittle of this crowning result of millenniums of esoteric studies. As well as those who lived in the days of the Psammetics, our present-dayphilosophers \"lift the Veil of Isis\"--for Isis is but the symbol of nature. But,they see only her physical forms. The soul within escapes their view; and theDivine Mother has no answer for them. There are anatomists, who, uncovering tosight no indwelling spirit under the layers of muscles, the network of nerves,or the cineritious matter, which they lift with the point of the scalpel, assertthat man has no soul. Such are as purblind in sophistry as the student, who,confining his research to the cold letter of the Kabala, dares say it has novivifying spirit. To see the true man who once inhabited the subject which liesbefore him, on the dissecting table, the surgeon must use other eyes than thoseof his body. So, the glorious truth covered up in the hieratic writings of theancient papyri can be revealed only to him who possesses the faculty ofintuition--which, if we call reason the eye of the mind, may be defined as theeye of the soul. Our modern science acknowledges a Supreme Power, an Invisible Principle, butdenies a Supreme Being, or Personal God. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_20] Logically, the differencebetween the two might be questioned; for in this case the Power and the Beingare identical. Human reason can hardly imagine to itself an Intelligent SupremePower without associating it with the idea of an Intelligent Being. The massescan never be expected to have a clear conception of the omnipotence andomnipresence of a supreme God, without investing with those attributes agigantic projection of their own personality. But the kabalists have neverlooked upon the invisible EN-SOPH otherwise than as a Power. So far our modern positivists have been anticipated by thousands of ages, intheir cautious philosophy. What the hermetic adept claims to demonstrate is,that simple common sense precludes the possibility that the universe is theresult of mere chance. Such an idea appears to him more absurd than to thinkthat the problems of Euclid were unconsciously formed by a monkey playing withgeometrical figures. Very few Christians understand, if indeed they know anything at all, of theJewish Theology. The Talmud is the darkest of enigmas even for most Jews, whilethose Hebrew scholars who do comprehend it do not boast of their knowledge.Their kabalistic books are still less understood by them; for in our days moreChristian than Jewish students are engrossed in the elimination of their greattruths. How much less is definitely known of the Oriental, or the universalKabala! Its adepts are few; but these heirs elect of the sages who firstdiscovered \"the starry truths which shone on the great Shemaia of the Chaldeanlore\" * have solved the \"absolute\" and are now resting from their grand labor.They cannot go beyond that which is given to mortals of this earth to know; andno one, not even these elect, can trespass beyond the line drawn by the fingerof the Divinity itself. Travellers have met these adepts on the shores of thesacred Ganges, brushed against them in the silent ruins of Thebes, and in themysterious deserted chambers of Luxor. Within the halls upon whose blue andgolden vaults the weird signs attract attention, but whose secret meaning isnever penetrated by the idle gazers, they have been seen but seldom recognized.Historical memoirs have recorded their presence in the brilliantly illuminatedsalons of European aristocracy. They have been encountered again on the arid anddesolate plains of the Great Sahara, as in the caves of Elephanta. They may befound everywhere, but make themselves known only to those who have devoted theirlives to unselfish study, and are not likely to turn back. Maimonides, the great Jewish theologian and historian, who at one time wasalmost deified by his countrymen and afterward treated as a heretic, remarks,that the more absurd and void of sense the Talmud seems the more sublime is thesecret meaning. This learned man has successfully demonstrated that the ChaldeanMagic, the science of Moses and other learned thaumaturgists was wholly based onan extensive knowledge of the various and now forgotten branches of naturalscience. Thoroughly acquainted with all the resources of the vegetable, animal,and mineral kingdoms, experts in occult chemistry and physics, psychologists aswell as physiologists, why wonder that the graduates or adepts instructed in themysterious sanctuaries of the temples, could perform wonders, which even in ourdays of enlightenment would appear supernatural? It is an insult to human nature to brand magic and the occult science with thename of imposture. To believe that for so many thousands of years, one-half ofmankind practiced deception and fraud on the other half, is equivalent to sayingthat the human race was composed only of knaves and incurable idiots. Where isthe country in which magic was not practised? At what age was it whollyforgotten? In the oldest documents now in our possession--the Vedas and the older laws ofManu--we find many magical rites practiced and permitted by the Brahmans. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_22] Thibet, Japan and Chinateach in the present age that which was taught by the oldest Chaldeans. Theclergy of these respective countries, prove moreover what they teach, namely:that the practice of moral and physical purity, and of certain austerities,developes the vital soulpower of self-illumination. Affording to man the controlover his own immortal spirit, it gives him truly magical powers over theelementary spirits inferior to himself. In the West we find magic of as high anantiquity as in the East. The Druids of Great Britain practised it in the silentcrypts of their deep caves; and Pliny devotes many a chapter to the \"wisdom\" **of the leaders of the Celts. The Semothees,--the Druids of the Gauls, expoundedthe physical as well as the spiritual sciences. They taught the secrets of theuniverse, the harmonious progress of the heavenly bodies, the formation of theearth, and above all--the immortality of the soul. *** Into their sacredgroves--natural academies built by the hand of the Invisible Architect--theinitiates assembled at the still hour of midnight to learn about what man oncewas and what he will be. **** They needed no artificial illumination, norlife-drawing gas, to light up their temples, for the chaste goddess of nightbeamed her most silvery rays on their oak-crowned heads; and their white-robedsacred bards knew how to converse with the solitary queen of the starryvault. ***** On the dead soil of the long by-gone past stand their sacred oaks, now dried upand stripped of their spiritual meaning by the venomous breath of materialism.But for the student of occult learning, their vegetation is still as verdant andluxuriant, and as full of deep and sacred truths, as at that hour when thearch-druid performed his magical cures, and waving the branch of mistletoe,severed with his golden sickle the green bough from its mother oak-tree. Magicis as old as man. It is as impossible to name the time when it sprang intoexistence as to indicate on what day the first man himself was born. Whenever awriter has started with the idea of connecting its first foundation in a countrywith some historical character, further research has proved his viewsgroundless. Odin, the Scandinavian priest and monarch, was thought by many tohave originated the practice of magic some seventy years B.C. But it was easilydemonstrated that the mysterious rites of the priestesses called Voilers, Valas,were greatly anterior to his age. * Some modern authors were bent on provingthat Zoroaster was the founder of magic, because he was the founder of theMagian religion. Ammianus Marcellinus, Arnobius, Pliny, and other ancienthistorians demonstrated conclusively that he was but a reformer of Magic aspracticed by the Chaldeans and Egyptians. ** The greatest teachers of divinity agree that nearly all ancient books werewritten symbolically and in a language intelligible only to the initiated. Thebiographical sketch of Apollonius of Tyana affords an example. As every Kabalistknows, it embraces the whole of the Hermetic philosophy, being a counterpart inmany respects of the traditions left us of King Solomon. It reads like a fairystory, but, as in the case of the latter, sometimes facts and historical eventsare presented to the world under the colors of a fiction. The journey to Indiarepresents allegorically the trials of a neophyte. His long discourses with theBrahmans, their sage advice, and the dialogues with the Corinthian Menippuswould, if interpreted, give the esoteric catechism. His visit to the empire ofthe wise men, and interview with their king Hiarchas, the oracle of Amphiaraus,explain symbolically many of the secret dogmas of Hermes. They would disclose,if understood, some of the most important secrets of nature. Eliphas Levi pointsout the great resemblance which exists between King Hiarchas and the fabulousHiram, of whom Solomon procured the cedars of Lebanon and the gold of Ophir. Wewould like to know whether modern Masons, even \"Grand Lecturers\" and the mostintelligent craftsmen belonging to important lodges, understand who the Hiram iswhose death they combine together to avenge? Putting aside the purely metaphysical teachings of the Kabala, if one woulddevote himself but to physical occultism, to the so-called branch oftherapeutics, the results might benefit some of our modern sciences; such aschemistry and medicine. Says Professor Draper: \"Sometimes, not without surprise,we meet with ideas which we flatter ourselves originated in our own times.\" Thisremark, uttered in relation to the scientific writings of the Saracens, wouldapply still better to the more secret Treatises of the ancients. Modernmedicine, while it has gained largely in anatomy, physiology, and pathology, andeven in therapeutics, has lost immensely by its narrowness of spirit, its rigidmaterialism, its sectarian dogmatism. One school in its purblindness sternlyignores whatever is developed by other schools; and all unite in ignoring everygrand conception of man or nature, developed by Mesmerism, or by Americanexperiments on the brain--every principle which does not conform to a stolidmaterialism. It would require a convocation of the hostile physicians of theseveral different schools to bring together what is now known of medicalscience, and it too often happens that after the best practitioners have vainlyexhausted their art upon a patient, a mesmerist or a \"healing medium\" willeffect a cure! The explorers of old medical literature, from the time ofHippocrates to that of Paracelsus and Van Helmont, will find a vast number ofwell-attested physiological and psychological facts and of measures or medicinesfor healing the sick which modern physicians superciliously refuse to employ. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_29] Even with respect tosurgery, modern practitioners have humbly and publicly confessed the totalimpossibility of their approximating to anything like the marvellous skilldisplayed in the art of bandaging by ancient Egyptians. The many hundred yardsof ligature enveloping a mummy from its ears down to every separate toe, werestudied by the chief surgical operators in Paris, and, notwithstanding that themodels were before their eyes, they were unable to accomplish anything like it. In the Abbott Egyptological collection, in New York City, may be seen numerousevidences of the skill of the ancients in various handicrafts; among others theart of lace-making; and, as it could hardly be expected but that the signs ofwoman's vanity should go side by side with those of man's strength, there arealso specimens of artificial hair, and gold ornaments of different kinds. TheNew York Tribune, reviewing the contents of the Ebers Papyrus, says:--\"Verily,there is no new thing under the sun. . . . Chapters 65, 66, 79, and 89 show thathair invigorators, hair dyes, pain-killers, and flea-powders were desiderata3,400 years ago.\" How few of our recent alleged discoveries are in reality new, and how manybelong to the ancients, is again most fairly and eloquently though but in partstated by our eminent philosophical writer, Professor John W. Draper. HisConflict between Religion and Science--a great book with a very badtitle--swarms with such facts. At page 13, he cites a few of the achievements ofancient philosophers, which excited the admiration of Greece. In Babylon was aseries of Chaldean astronomical observations, ranging back through nineteenhundred and three years, which Callisthenes sent to Aristotle. Ptolemy, theEgyptian king-astronomer possessed a Babylonian record of eclipses going backseven hundred and forty-seven years before our era. As Prof. Draper trulyremarks: \"Long-continued and close observations were necessary before some ofthese astronomical results that have reached our times could have beenascertained. Thus, the Babylonians had fixed the length of a tropical yearwithin twenty-five seconds of the truth; their estimate of the sidereal year wasbarely two minutes in excess. They had detected the precession of the equinoxes.They knew the causes of eclipses, and, by the aid of their cycle, called saros,could predict them. Their estimate of the value of that cycle, which is morethan 6,585 days, was within nineteen and a half minutes of the truth.\" \"Such facts furnish incontrovertible proof of the patience and skill with whichastronomy had been cultivated in Mesopotamia, and that, with very inadequateinstrumental means, it had reached no inconsiderable perfection. These oldobservers had made a catalogue of the stars, had divided the zodiac into twelvesigns; they had parted the day into twelve hours, the night into twelve. Theyhad, as Aristotle says, for a long time devoted themselves to observations ofstar-occultations by the moon. They had correct views of the structure of thesolar system, and knew the order of emplacement of the planets. They constructedsundials, clepsydras, astrolabes, gnomons.\" Speaking of the world of eternal truths that lies \"within the world of transientdelusions and unrealities,\" Professor Draper says: \"That world is not to bediscovered through the vain traditions that have brought down to us the opinionof men who lived in the morning of civilization, nor in the dreams of mysticswho thought that they were inspired. It is to be discovered by theinvestigations of geometry, and by the practical interrogations of nature.\" Precisely. The issue could not be better stated. This eloquent writer tells us aprofound truth. He does not, however, tell us the whole truth, because he doesnot know it. He has not described the nature or extent of the knowledge impartedin the Mysteries. No subsequent people has been so proficient in geometry as thebuilders of the Pyramids and other Titanic monuments, antediluvian andpostdiluvian. On the other hand, none has ever equalled them in the practicalinterrogation of nature. An undeniable proof of this is the significance of their countless symbols.Every one of these symbols is an embodied idea,--combining the conception of theDivine Invisible with the earthly and visible. The former is derived from thelatter strictly through analogy according to the hermetic formula--\"as below, soit is above.\" Their symbols show great knowledge of natural sciences and apractical study of cosmical power. As to practical results to be obtained by \"the investigations of geometry,\" veryfortunately for students who are coming upon the stage of action, we are nolonger forced to content ourselves with mere conjectures. In our own times, anAmerican, Mr. George H. Felt, of New York, who, if he continues as he has begun,may one day be recognized as the greatest geometer of the age, has been enabled,by the sole help of the premises established by the ancient Egyptians, to arriveat results which we will give in his own language. \"Firstly,\" says Mr. Felt,\"the fundamental diagram to which all science of elementary geometry, both planeand solid, is referable; to produce arithmetical systems of proportion in ageometrical manner; to identify this figure with all the remains of architectureand sculpture, in all which it had been followed in a marvellously exact manner;to determine that the Egyptians had used it as the basis of all theirastronomical calculations, on which their religious symbolism was almostentirely founded; to find its traces among all the remnants of art andarchitecture of the Greeks; to discover its traces so strongly among the Jewishsacred records, as to prove conclusively that it was founded thereon; to findthat the whole system had been discovered by the Egyptians after researches oftens of thousands of years into the laws of nature, and that it might truly becalled the science of the Universe.\" Further it enabled him \"to determine withprecision problems in physiology heretofore only surmised; to first develop sucha Masonic philosophy as showed it to be conclusively the first science andreligion, as it will be the last\"; and we may add, lastly, to prove by oculardemonstrations that the Egyptian sculptors and architects obtained the modelsfor the quaint figures which adorn the facades and vestibules of their temples,not in the disordered fantasies of their own brains, but from the \"viewlessraces of the air,\" and other kingdoms of nature, whom he, like them, claims tomake visible by resort to their own chemical and kabalistical processes. Schweigger proves that the symbols of all the mythologies have a scientificfoundation and substance. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_30]It is only through recent discoveries of the physical electro-magnetical powersof nature that such experts in Mesmerism as Ennemoser, Schweigger and Bart, inGermany, Baron Du Potet and Regazzoni, in France and Italy, were enabled totrace with almost faultless accuracy the true relation which each Theomythosbore to some one of these powers. The Idaeic finger, which had such importancein the magic art of healing, means an iron finger, which is attracted andrepulsed in turn by magnetic, natural forces. It produced, in Samothrace,wonders of healing by restoring affected organs to their normal condition. Bart goes deeper than Schweigger into the significations of the old myths, andstudies the subject from both its spiritual and physical aspects. He treats atlength of the Phrygian Dactyls, those \"magicians and exorcists of sickness,\" andof the Cabeirian Theurgists. He says: \"While we treat of the close union of theDactyls and magnetic forces, we are not necessarily confined to the magneticstone, and our views of nature but take a glance at magnetism in its wholemeaning. Then it is clear how the initiated, who called themselves Dactyls,created astonishment in the people through their magic arts, working as theydid, miracles of a healing nature. To this united themselves many other thingswhich the priesthood of antiquity was wont to practice; the cultivation of theland and of morals, the advancement of art and science, mysteries, and secretconsecrations. All this was done by the priestly Cabeirians, and wherefore notguided and supported by the mysterious spirits of nature?\" ** Schweigger is ofthe same opinion, and demonstrates that the phenomena of ancient Theurgy wereproduced by magnetic powers \"under the guidance of spirits.\" Despite their apparent Polytheism, the ancients--those of the educated class atall events--were entirely monotheistical; and this, too, ages upon ages beforethe days of Moses. In the Ebers Papyrus this fact is shown conclusively in thefollowing words, translated from the first four lines of Plate I.: \"I came fromHeliopolis with the great ones from Het-aat, the Lords of Protection, themasters of eternity and salvation. I came from Sais with the Mother-goddesses,who extended to me protection. The Lord of the Universe told me how to free thegods from all murderous diseases.\" Eminent men were called gods by the ancients.The deification of mortal men and supposititious gods is no more a proof againsttheir monotheism than the monument-building of modern Christians, who erectstatues to their heroes, is proof of their polytheism. Americans of the presentcentury would consider it absurd in their posterity 3,000 years hence toclassify them as idolaters for having built statues to their god Washington. Soshrouded in mystery was the Hermetic Philosophy that Volney asserted that theancient peoples worshipped their gross material symbols as divine in themselves;whereas these were only considered as representing esoteric principles. Dupuis,also, after devoting many years of study to the problem, mistook the symboliccircle, and attributed their religion solely to astronomy. Eberhart (BerlinerMonatschrift) and many other German writers of the last and present centuries,dispose of magic most unceremoniously, and think it due to the Platonic mythosof the Timaeus. But how, without possessing a knowledge of the mysteries, was itpossible for these men or any others not endowed with the finer intuition of aChampollion, to discover the esoteric half of that which was concealed, behindthe veil of Isis, from all except the adepts? The merit of Champollion as an Egyptologist none will question. He declares thateverything demonstrates the ancient Egyptians to have been profoundlymonotheistical. The accuracy of the writings of the mysterious HermesTrismegistus, whose antiquity runs back into the night of time, is corroboratedby him to their minutest details. Ennemoser also says: \"Into Egypt and the Eastwent Herodotus, Thales, Parmenides, Empedocles, Orpheus, and Pythagoras, toinstruct themselves in Natural Philosophy and Theology.\" There, too, Mosesacquired his wisdom, and Jesus passed the earlier years of his life. Thither gathered the students of all countries before Alexandria was founded.\"How comes it,\" Ennemoser goes on to say, \"that so little has become known ofthese mysteries? through so many ages and amongst so many different times andpeople? The answer is that it is owing to the universally strict silence of theinitiated. Another cause may be found in the destruction and total loss of allthe written memorials of the secret knowledge of the remotest antiquity.\" Numa'sbooks, described by Livy, consisting of treatises upon natural philosophy, werefound in his tomb; but they were not allowed to be made known, lest they shouldreveal the most secret mysteries of the state religion. The senate and thetribune of the people determined that the books themselves should be burned,which was done in public. * Magic was considered a divine science which led to a participation in theattributes of Divinity itself. \"It unveils the operations of nature,\" says PhiloJudaeus, \"and leads to the contemplation of celestial powers.\" ** In laterperiods its abuse and degeneration into sorcery made it an object of generalabhorrence. We must therefore deal with it only as it was in the remote past,during those ages when every true religion was based on a knowledge of theoccult powers of nature. It was not the sacerdotal class in ancient Persia thatestablished magic, as it is commonly thought, but the Magi, who derive theirname from it. The Mobeds, priests of the Parsis--the ancient Ghebers--are named,even at the present day, Magoi, in the dialect of the Pehlvi. *** Magic appearedin the world with the earlier races of men. Cassien mentions a treatise,well-known in the fourth and fifth centuries, which was accredited to Ham, theson of Noah, who in his turn was reputed to have received it from Jared, thefourth generation from Seth, the son of Adam. **** Moses was indebted for his knowledge to the mother of the Egyptian princess,Thermuthis, who saved him from the waters of the Nile. The wife ofPharaoh, ***** Batria, was an initiate herself, and the Jews owe to her thepossession of their prophet, \"learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, andmighty in words and deeds.\" ****** Justin Martyr, giving as his authority TrogusPompeius, shows Joseph as having acquired a great knowledge in magical arts withthe high priests of Egypt. ******* The ancients knew more concerning certain sciences than our modern savants haveyet discovered. Reluctant as many are to confess as much, it has beenacknowledged by more than one scientist. \"The degree of scientific knowledgeexisting in an early period of society was much greater than the moderns arewilling to admit\"; says Dr. A. Todd Thomson, the editor of Occult Sciences, bySalverte; \"but,\" he adds, \"it was confined to the temples, carefully veiled fromthe eyes of the people and opposed only to the priesthood.\" Speaking of theKabala, the learned Franz von Baader remarks that \"not only our salvation andwisdom, but our science itself came to us from the Jews.\" But why not completethe sentence and tell the reader from whom the Jews got their wisdom? Origen, who had belonged to the Alexandrian school of Platonists, declares thatMoses, besides the teachings of the covenant, communicated some very importantsecrets \"from the hidden depths of the law\" to the seventy elders. These heenjoined them to impart only to persons whom they found worthy. St. Jerome names the Jews of Tiberias and Lydda as the only teachers of themystical manner of interpretation. Finally, Ennemoser expresses a strong opinionthat \"the writings of Dionysius Areopagita have palpably been grounded on theJewish Kabala.\" When we take in consideration that the Gnostics, or earlyChristians, were but the followers of the old Essenes under a new name, thisfact is nothing to be wondered at. Professor Molitor gives the Kabala its justdue. He says: \"The age of inconsequence and shallowness, in theology as well as in sciences,is past, and since that revolutionary rationalism has left nothing behind butits own emptiness, after having destroyed everything positive, it seems now tobe the time to direct our attention anew to that mysterious revelation which isthe living spring whence our salvation must come . . . the Mysteries of ancientIsrael, which contain all secrets of modern Israel, would be particularlycalculated to . . . found the fabric of theology upon its deepest theosophicalprinciples, and to gain a firm basis to all ideal sciences. It would open a newpath . . . to the obscure labyrinth of the myths, mysteries and constitutions ofprimitive nations. . . . In these traditions alone are contained the system ofthe schools of the prophets, which the prophet Samuel did not found, but onlyrestored, whose end was no other than to lead the scholars to wisdom and thehighest knowledge, and when they had been found worthy, to induct them intodeeper mysteries. Classed with these mysteries was magic, which was of a doublenature--divine magic, and evil magic, or the black art. Each of these is againdivisible into two kinds, the active and seeing; in the first, man endeavors toplace himself en rapport with the world to learn hidden things; in the latter heendeavors to gain power over spirits; in the former, to perform good andbeneficial acts; in the latter to do all kinds of diabolical and unnaturaldeeds.\" * The clergy of the three most prominent Christian bodies, the Greek, RomanCatholic, and Protestant, discountenance every spiritual phenomenon manifestingitself through the so-called \"mediums.\" A very brief period, indeed, has elapsedsince both the two latter ecclesiastical corporations burned, hanged, andotherwise murdered every helpless victim through whose organism spirits--andsometimes blind and as yet unexplained forces of nature--manifested themselves.At the head of these three churches, pre-eminent stands the Church of Rome. Herhands are scarlet with the innocent blood of countless victims shed in the nameof the Moloch-like divinity at the head of her creed. She is ready and eager tobegin again. But she is bound hand and foot by that nineteenth century spirit ofprogress and religious freedom which she reviles and blasphemes daily. TheGraeco-Russian Church is the most amiable and Christ-like in her primitive,simple, though blind faith. Despite the fact that there has been no practicalunion between the Greek and Latin Churches, and that the two parted company longcenturies ago, the Roman Pontiffs seem to invariably ignore the fact. They havein the most impudent manner possible arrogated to themselves jurisdiction notonly over the countries within the Greek communion but also over all Protestantsas well. \"The Church insists,\" says Professor Draper, \"that the state has norights over any thing which it declares to be within its domain, and thatProtestantism being a mere rebellion, has no rights at all; that even inProtestant communities the Catholic bishop is the only lawful spiritualpastor.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_40] Decreesunheeded, encyclical letters unread, invitations to ecumenical councilsunnoticed, excommunications laughed at--all these have seemed to make nodifference. Their persistence has only been matched by their effrontery. In1864, the culmination of absurdity was attained when Pius IX. excommunicated andfulminated publicly his anathemas against the Russian Emperor, as a \"schismaticcast out from the bosom of the Holy Mother Church.\" ** Neither he nor hisancestors, nor Russia since it was Christianized, a thousand years ago, haveever consented to join the Roman Catholics. Why not claim ecclesiasticaljurisdiction over the Buddhists of Thibet, or the shadows of the ancientHyk-Sos? The mediumistic phenomena have manifested themselves at all times in Russia aswell as in other countries. This force ignores religious differences; it laughsat nationalities; and invades unasked any individuality, whether of a crownedhead or a poor beggar. Not even the present Vice-God, Pius IX., himself, could avoid the unwelcomeguest. For the last fifty years his Holiness has been known to be subject tovery extraordinary fits. Inside the Vatican they are termed Divine visions;outside, physicians call them epileptic fits; and popular rumor attributes themto an obsession by the ghosts of Peruggia, Castelfidardo, and Mentana! \"The lights burn blue: it is now dead midnight,Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh,Methought the souls of all that I caused to be murderedCame. . . .\" *The Prince of Hohenlohe, so famous during the first quarter of our century forhis healing powers, was himself a great medium. Indeed, these phenomena andpowers belong to no particular age or country. They form a portion of thepsychological attributes of man--the Microcosmos. For centuries have the Klikouchy, ** the Yourodevoy, *** and other miserablecreatures been afflicted with strange disorders, which the Russian clergy andthe populace attribute to possession by the devil. They throng the entrances ofthe cathedrals, without daring to trust themselves inside, lest theirself-willed controlling demons might fling them on the ground. Voroneg, Kiew,Kazan, and all cities which possess the thaumaturgical relics of canonizedsaints, abound with such unconscious mediums. One can always find numbers ofthem, congregating in hideous groups, and hanging about the gates and porches.At certain stages of the celebration of the mass by the officiating clergy, suchas the appearance of the sacraments, or the beginning of the prayer and chorus,\"Ejey Cherouvim,\" these half-maniacs, half-mediums, begin crowing like cocks,barking, bellowing and braying, and, finally, fall down in fearful convulsions.\"The unclean one cannot bear the holy prayer,\" is the pious explanation. Movedby pity, some charitable souls administer restoratives to the \"afflicted ones,\"and distribute alms among them. Occasionally, a priest is invited to exorcise,in which event he either performs the ceremony for the sake of love and charity,or the alluring prospect of a twenty-copeck silver bit, according to hisChristian impulses. But these miserable creatures--who are mediums, for theyprophesy and see visions sometimes, when the fit is genuine ****--are nevermolested because of their misfortune. Why should the clergy persecute them, orpeople hate and denounce them as damnable witches or wizards? Common sense andjustice surely suggest that if any are to be punished it is certainly not thevictims who cannot help themselves, but the demon who is alleged to controltheir actions. The worst that happens to the patient is, that the priestinundates him or her with holy water, and causes the poor creature to catchcold. This failing in efficacy, the Klikoucha is left to the will of God, andtaken care of in love and pity. Superstitious and blind as it is, a faithconducted on such principles certainly deserves some respect, and can never beoffensive, either to man or the true God. Not so with that of the RomanCatholics; and hence, it is they, and secondarily, the Protestant clergy--withthe exception of some foremost thinkers among them--that we purpose questioningin this work. We want to know upon what grounds they base their right to treatHindus and Chinese spiritualists and kabalists in the way they do; denouncingthem, in company with the infidels--creatures of their own making--as so manyconvicts sentenced to the inextinguishable fires of hell. Far from us be the thought of the slightest irreverence--let aloneblasphemy--toward the Divine Power which called into being all things, visibleand invisible. Of its majesty and boundless perfection we dare not even think.It is enough for us to know that It exists and that It is all wise. Enough thatin common with our fellow creatures we possess a spark of Its essence. Thesupreme power whom we revere is the boundless and endless one--the grand\"CENTRAL SPIRITUAL SUN\" by whose attributes and the visible effects of whoseinaudible WILL we are surrounded--the God of the ancient and the God of modernseers. His nature can be studied only in the worlds called forth by his mightyFIAT. His revelation is traced with his own finger in imperishable figures ofuniversal harmony upon the face of the Cosmos. It is the only INFALLIBLE gospelwe recognize. Speaking of ancient geographers, Plutarch remarks in Theseus, that they \"crowdinto the edges of their maps parts of the world which they do not know about,adding notes in the margin to the effect that beyond this lies nothing but sandydeserts full of wild beasts and unapproachable bogs.\" Do not our theologians andscientists do the same? While the former people the invisible world with eitherangels or devils, our philosophers try to persuade their disciples that wherethere is no matter there is nothing. How many of our inveterate skeptics belong, notwithstanding their materialism,to Masonic Lodges? The brothers of the Rosie-Cross, mysterious practitioners ofthe mediaeval ages, still live--but in name only. They may \"shed tears at thegrave of their respectable Master, Hiram Abiff \"; but vainly will they searchfor the true locality, \"where the sprig of myrtle was placed.\" The dead letterremains alone, the spirit has fled. They are like the English or German chorusof the Italian opera, who descend in the fourth act of Ernani into the crypt ofCharlemagne, singing their conspiracy in a tongue utterly unknown to them. So,our modern knights of the Sacred Arch may descend every night if they choose\"through the nine arches into the bowels of the earth,\"--they \"will neverdiscover the sacred Delta of Enoch.\" The \"Sir Knights in the South Valley\" andthose in \"the North Valley\" may try to assure themselves that \"enlightenmentdawns upon their minds,\" and that as they progress in Masonry \"the veil ofsuperstition, despotism, tyranny\" and so on, no longer obscures the visions oftheir minds. But these are all empty words so long as they neglect their motherMagic, and turn their backs upon its twin sister, Spiritualism. Verily, \"SirKnights of the Orient,\" you may \"leave your stations and sit upon the floor inattitudes of grief, with your heads resting upon your hands,\" for you have causeto bewail and mourn your fate. Since Philippe le Bel destroyed theKnights-Templars, not one has appeared to clear up your doubts notwithstandingall claims to the contrary. Truly, you are \"wanderers from Jerusalem, seekingthe lost treasure of the holy place.\" Have you found it? Alas, no! for the holyplace is profaned; the pillars of wisdom, strength and beauty are destroyed.Henceforth, \"you must wander in darkness,\" and \"travel in humility,\" among thewoods and mountains in search of the \"lost word.\" \"Pass on!\"--you will neverfind it so long as you limit your journeys to seven or even seven times seven;because you are \"travelling in darkness,\" and this darkness can only bedispelled by the light of the blazing torch of truth which alone the rightdescendants of Ormasd carry. They alone can teach you the true pronunciation ofthe name revealed to Enoch, Jacob and Moses. \"Pass on! Till your R. S. W. shalllearn to multiply 333, and strike instead 666--the number of the ApocalypticBeast, you may just as well observe prudence and act \"sub rosa.\" In order to demonstrate that the notions which the ancients entertained aboutdividing human history into cycles were not utterly devoid of a philosophicalbasis, we will close this chapter by introducing to the reader one of the oldesttraditions of antiquity as to the evolution of our planet. At the close of each \"great year,\" called by Aristotle--according toCensorinus--the greatest, and which consists of six sars *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_46] our planet is subjected toa thorough physical revolution. The polar and equatorial climates graduallyexchange places; the former moving slowly toward the Line, and the tropicalzone, with its exuberant vegetation and swarming animal life, replacing theforbidding wastes of the icy poles. This change of climate is necessarilyattended by cataclysms, earthquakes, and other cosmical throes. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_47] As the beds of the oceanare displaced, at the end of every decimillennium and about one neros, asemi-universal deluge like the legendary Noachian flood is brought about. Thisyear was called the Heliacal by the Greeks; but no one outside the sanctuaryknew anything certain either as to its duration or particulars. The winter ofthis year was called the Cataclysm or the Deluge,--the Summer, the Ecpyrosis.The popular traditions taught that at these alternate seasons the world was inturn burned and deluged. This is what we learn at least from the AstronomicalFragments of Censorinus and Seneca. So uncertain were the commentators about thelength of this year, that none except Herodotus and Linus, who assigned to it,the former 10,800, and the latter 13,984, came near the truth. ** According tothe claims of the Babylonian priests, corroborated by Eupolemus, *** \"the cityof Babylon, owes its foundation to those who were saved from the catastrophe ofthe deluge; they were the giants and they built the tower which is noticed inhistory.\" **** These giants who were great astrologers and had received moreoverfrom their fathers, \"the sons of God,\" every instruction pertaining to secretmatters, instructed the priests in their turn, and left in the temples all therecords of the periodical cataclysm that they had witnessed themselves. This ishow the high priests came by the knowledge of the great years. When we remember,moreover, that Plato in the Timaeus cites the old Egyptian priest rebuking Solonfor his ignorance of the fact that there were several such deluges as the greatone of Ogyges, we can easily ascertain that this belief in the Heliakos was adoctrine held by the initiated priests the world over. The Neroses, the Vrihaspati, or the periods called yugas or kalpas, arelife-problems to solve. The Satya-yug and Buddhistic cycles of chronology wouldmake a mathematician stand aghast at the array of ciphers. The Maha-kalpaembraces an untold number of periods far back in the antediluvian ages. Theirsystem comprises a kalpa or grand period of 4,320,000,000 years, which theydivide into four lesser yugas, running as follows: 1st.--Satya yug--1,728,000 years.2d.--Tretya yug--1,296,000 years.3d.--Dvapa yug ---- 864,000 years.4th.--Kali yug ------ 432,000 years.Total -------------- 4,320,000 years.which make one divine age or Maha-yug; seventy-one Maha-yugs make 306,720,000years, to which is added a sandhi (or the time when day and night border on eachother, morning and evening twilight), equal to a Satya-yug, 1,728,000, make amanwantara of 308,448,000 years; * fourteen manwantaras make 4,318,272,000years; to which must be added a sandhi to begin the kalpa, 1,728,000 years,making the kalpa or grand period of 4,320,000,000 of years. As we are now onlyin the Kali-yug of the twenty-eighth age of the seventh manwantara of308,448,000 years, we have yet sufficient time before us to wait before we reacheven half of the time allotted to the world. These ciphers are not fanciful, but founded upon actual astronomicalcalculations, as has been demonstrated by S. Davis. ** Many a scientist, Higginsamong others, notwithstanding their researches, has been utterly perplexed as towhich of these was the secret cycle. Bunsen has demonstrated that the Egyptianpriests, who made the cyclic notations, kept them always in the profoundestmystery. *** Perhaps their difficulty arose from the fact that the calculationsof the ancients applied equally to the spiritual progress of humanity as to thephysical. It will not be difficult to understand the close correspondence drawnby the ancients between the cycles of nature and of mankind, if we keep in mindtheir belief in the constant and all-potent influences of the planets upon thefortunes of humanity. Higgins justly believed that the cycle of the Indiansystem, of 432,000, is the true key of the secret cycle. But his failure intrying to decipher it was made apparent; for as it pertained to the mystery ofthe creation, this cycle was the most inviolable of all. It was repeated insymbolic figures only in the Chaldean Book of Numbers, the original of which, ifnow extant, is certainly not to be found in libraries, as it formed one of themost ancient Books of Hermes, * the number of which is at present undetermined. Calculating by the secret period of the Great Neros and the Hindu Kalpas, somekabalists, mathematicians and archeologists who knew naught of the secretcomputations made the above number of 21,000 years to be 24,000 years, for thelength of the great year, as it was to the renewal only of our globe that theythought the last period of 6,000 years applied. Higgins gives as a reason forit, that it was anciently thought that the equinoxes preceded only after therate of 2,000, not 2,160, years in a sign; for thus it would allow for thelength of the great year four times 6,000 or 24,000 years. \"Hence,\" he says,\"might arise their immensely-lengthened cycles; because, it would be the samewith this great year as with the common year, till it travelled round animmensely-lengthened circle, when it would come to the old point again.\" Hetherefore accounts for the 24,000 in the following manner: \"If the angle whichthe plane of the ecliptic makes with the plane of the equator had decreasedgradually and regularly, as it was till very lately supposed to do, the twoplanes would have coincided in about ten ages, 6,000 years; in ten ages, 6,000years more, the sun would have been situated relatively to the SouthernHemisphere as he is now to the Northern; in ten ages, 6,000 years more, the twoplanes would coincide again; and, in ten ages, 6,000 years more, he would besituated as he is now, after a lapse of about twenty-four or twenty-fivethousand years in all. When the sun arrived at the equator, the ten ages or sixthousand years would end, and the world would be destroyed by fire; when hearrived at the southern point, it would be destroyed by water. And thus, itwould be destroyed at the end of every 6,000 years, or ten neroses.\" * This method of calculating by the neroses, without allowing any considerationfor the secrecy in which the ancient philosophers, who were exclusively of thesacerdotal order, held their knowledge, gave rise to the greatest errors. It ledthe Jews, as well as some of the Christian Platonists, to maintain that theworld would be destroyed at the end of six thousand years. Gale shows how firmlythis belief was rooted in the Jews. It has also led modern scientists todiscredit entirely the hypothesis of the ancients. It has given rise to theformation of different religious sects, which, like the Adventists of ourcentury, are always living in the expectation of the approaching destruction ofthe world. As our planet revolves once every year around the sun and at the same time turnsonce in every twenty-four hours upon its own axis, thus traversing minor circleswithin a larger one, so is the work of the smaller cyclic periods accomplishedand recommenced, within the Great Saros. The revolution of the physical world, according to the ancient doctrine, isattended by a like revolution in the world of intellect--the spiritual evolutionof the world proceeding in cycles, like the physical one. Thus we see in history a regular alternation of ebb and flow in the tide ofhuman progress. The great kingdoms and empires of the world, after reaching theculmination of their greatness, descend again, in accordance with the same lawby which they ascended; till, having reached the lowest point, humanityreasserts itself and mounts up once more, the height of its attainment being, bythis law of ascending progression by cycles, somewhat higher than the point fromwhich it had before descended. The division of the history of mankind into Golden, Silver, Copper and IronAges, is not a fiction. We see the same thing in the literature of peoples. Anage of great inspiration and unconscious productiveness is invariably followedby an age of criticism and consciousness. The one affords material for theanalyzing and critical intellect of the other. Thus, all those great characters who tower like giants in the history ofmankind, like Buddha-Siddartha, and Jesus, in the realm of spiritual, andAlexander the Macedonian and Napoleon the Great, in the realm of physicalconquests, were but reflexed images of human types which had existed tenthousand years before, in the preceding decimillennium, reproduced by themysterious powers controlling the destinies of our world. There is no prominentcharacter in all the annals of sacred or profane history whose prototype wecannot find in the half-fictitious and half-real traditions of bygone religionsand mythologies. As the star, glimmering at an immeasurable distance above ourheads, in the boundless immensity of the sky, reflects itself in the smoothwaters of a lake, so does the imagery of men of the antediluvian ages reflectitself in the periods we can embrace in an historical retrospect. \"As above, so it is below. That which has been, will return again. As in heaven,so on earth.\" The world is always ungrateful to its great men. Florence has built a statue toGalileo, but hardly even mentions Pythagoras. The former had a ready guide inthe treatises of Copernicus, who had been obliged to contend against theuniversally established Ptolemaic system. But neither Galileo nor modernastronomy discovered the emplacement of the planetary bodies. Thousands of agesbefore, it was taught by the sages of Middle Asia, and brought thence byPythagoras, not as a speculation, but as a demonstrated science. \"The numeralsof Pythagoras,\" says Porphyry, \"were hieroglyphical symbols, by means whereof heexplained all ideas concerning the nature of all things.\" * Verily, then, to antiquity alone have we to look for the origin of all things.How well Hargrave Jennings expresses himself when speaking of Pyramids, and howtrue are his words when he asks: \"Is it at all reasonable to conclude, at aperiod when knowledge was at the highest, and when the human powers were, incomparison with ours at the present time, prodigious, that all theseindomitable, scarcely believable physical effects--that such achievements asthose of the Egyptians--were devoted to a mistake? that the myriads of the Nilewere fools laboring in the dark, and that all the magic of their great men wasforgery, and that we, in despising that which we call their superstition andwasted power, are alone the wise? No! there is much more in these old religionsthan probably--in the audacity of modern denial, in the confidence of thesesuperficial-science times, and in the derision of these days without faith--isin the least degree supposed. We do not understand the old time. . . . . Thus wesee how classic practice and heathen teaching may be made to reconcile--how eventhe Gentile and the Hebrew, the mythological and the Christian doctrineharmonize in the general faith founded on Magic. That Magic is indeed possibleis the moral of this book.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu000.htm#fn_57] It is possible. Thirty years ago, when the first rappings of Rochester awakenedslumbering attention to the reality of an invisible world; when the gentleshower of raps gradually became a torrent which overflowed the whole globe,spiritualists had to contend but against two potencies--theology and science.But the theosophists have, in addition to these, to meet the world at large andthe spiritualists first of all. \"There is a personal God, and there is a personal Devil!\" thunders the Christianpreacher. \"Let him be anathema who dares say nay!\" \"There is no personal God,except the gray matter in our brain,\" contemptuously replies the materialist.\"And there is no Devil. Let him be considered thrice an idiot who says aye.\"Meanwhile the occultists and true philosophers heed neither of the twocombatants, but keep perseveringly at their work. None of them believe in theabsurd, passionate, and fickle God of superstition, but all of them believe ingood and evil. Our human reason, the emanation of our finite mind, is certainlyincapable of comprehending a divine intelligence, an endless and infiniteentity; and, according to strict logic, that which transcends our understandingand would remain thoroughly incomprehensible to our senses cannot exist for us;hence, it does not exist. So far finite reason agrees with science, and says:\"There is no God.\" But, on the other hand, our Ego, that which lives and thinksand feels independently of us in our mortal casket, does more than believe. Itknows that there exists a God in nature, for the sole and invincible Artificerof all lives in us as we live in Him. No dogmatic faith or exact science is ableto uproot that intuitional feeling inherent in man, when he has once fullyrealized it in himself. Human nature is like universal nature in its abhorrence of a vacuum. It feels anintuitional yearning for a Supreme Power. Without a God, the cosmos would seemto it but like a soulless corpse. Being forbidden to search for Him where aloneHis traces would be found, man filled the aching void with the personal God whomhis spiritual teachers built up for him from the crumbling ruins of heathenmyths and hoary philosophies of old. How otherwise explain the mushroom growthof new sects, some of them absurd beyond degree? Mankind have one innate,irrepressible craving, that must be satisfied in any religion that wouldsupplant the dogmatic, undemonstrated and undemonstrable theology of ourChristian ages. This is the yearning after the proofs of immortality. As SirThomas Browne has expressed it: . . . . \"it is the heaviest stone thatmelancholy can throw at a man, to tell him that he is at the end of his nature,or that there is no future state to come, unto which this seems progressive, andotherwise made in vain.\" Let any religion offer itself that can supply theseproofs in the shape of scientific facts, and the established system will bedriven to the alternative of fortifying its dogmas with such facts, or ofpassing out of the reverence and affection of Christendom. Many a Christiandivine has been forced to acknowledge that there is no authentic source whencethe assurance of a future state could have been derived by man. How could thensuch a belief have stood for countless ages, were it not that among all nations,whether civilized or savage, man has been allowed the demonstrative proof? Isnot the very existence of such a belief an evidence that thinking philosopherand unreasoning savage have both been compelled to acknowledge the testimony oftheir senses? That if, in isolated instances, spectral illusion may haveresulted from physical causes, on the other hand, in thousands of instances,apparitions of persons have held converse with several individuals at once, whosaw and heard them collectively, and could not all have been diseased in mind? The greatest thinkers of Greece and Rome regarded such matters as demonstratedfacts. They distinguished the apparitions by the names of manes, anima andumbra: the manes descending after the decease of the individual into theUnderworld; the anima, or pure spirit, ascending to heaven; and the restlessumbra (earth-bound spirit), hovering about its tomb, because the attraction ofmatter and love of its earthly body prevailed in it and prevented its ascensionto higher regions. \"Terra legit carnem tumulum circumvolet umbra,Orcus habet manes, spiritus astra petit,\"says Ovid, speaking of the threefold constituents of souls. But all such definitions must be subjected to the careful analysis ofphilosophy. Too many of our thinkers do not consider that the numerous changesin language, the allegorical phraseology and evident secretiveness of old Mysticwriters, who were generally under an obligation never to divulge the solemnsecrets of the sanctuary, might have sadly misled translators and commentators.The phrases of the mediaeval alchemist they read literally; and even the veiledsymbolology of Plato is commonly misunderstood by the modern scholar. One daythey may learn to know better, and so become aware that the method of extremenecessarianism was practiced in ancient as well as in modern philosophy; thatfrom the first ages of man, the fundamental truths of all that we are permittedto know on earth was in the safe keeping of the adepts of the sanctuary; thatthe difference in creeds and religious practice was only external; and thatthose guardians of the primitive divine revelation, who had solved every problemthat is within the grasp of human intellect, were bound together by a universalfreemasonry of science and philosophy, which formed one unbroken chain aroundthe globe. It is for philology and psychology to find the end of the thread.That done, it will then be ascertained that, by relaxing one single loop of theold religious systems, the chain of mystery may be disentangled. The neglect and withholding of these proofs have driven such eminent minds asHare and Wallace, and other men of power, into the fold of modern spiritualism.At the same time it has forced others, congenitally devoid of spiritualintuitions, into a gross materialism that figures under various names. But we see no utility in prosecuting the subject further. For, though in theopinion of most of our contemporaries, there has been but one day of learning,in whose twilight stood the older philosophers, and whose noontide brightness isall our own; and though the testimony of scores of ancient and mediaevalthinkers has proved valueless to modern experimenters, as though the world datedfrom A.D. 1, and all knowledge were of recent growth, we will not lose hope orcourage. The moment is more opportune than ever for the review of oldphilosophies. Archaeologists, philologists, astronomers, chemists and physicistsare getting nearer and nearer to the point where they will be forced to considerthem. Physical science has already reached its limits of exploration; dogmatictheology sees the springs of its inspiration dry. Unless we mistake the signs,the day is approaching when the world will receive the proofs that only ancientreligions were in harmony with nature, and ancient science embraced all that canbe known. Secrets long kept may be revealed; books long forgotten and arts longtime lost may be brought out to light again; papyri and parchments ofinestimable importance will turn up in the hands of men who pretend to haveunrolled them from mummies, or stumbled upon them in buried crypts; tablets andpillars, whose sculptured revelations will stagger theologians and confoundscientists, may yet be excavated and interpreted. Who knows the possibilities ofthe future? An era of disenchantment and rebuilding will soon begin--nay, hasalready begun. The cycle has almost run its course; a new one is about to begin,and the future pages of history may contain full evidence, and convey full proofthat \"If ancestry can be in aught believed,Descending spirits have conversed with man,And told him secrets of the world unknown.\"[images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES1:* The name is used in the sense of the Greek word ανθροπος. 1:** The traditions of the Oriental Kabalists claim their science to be olderthan that.

Iamblichus, on the authority of the Egyptian priest Abammon, attributes1200 of such books to Hermes, and Manetho 36,000. But the testimony ofIamblichus as a neo-Platonist and theurgist is of course rejected by moderncritics. Manetho, who is held by Bunsen in the highest consideration as a\"purely historical personage\" . . . with whom \"none of the later nativehistorians can be compared . . . .\" (See \"Egypte,\" i, p. 97), suddenly becomes aPseudo-Manetho, as soon as the ideas propounded by him clash with the scientificprejudices against magic and the occult knowledge claimed by the ancientpriests. However, none of the archeologists doubt for a moment the almostincredible antiquity of the Hermetic books. Champollion shows the greatestregard for their authenticity and great truthfulness, corroborated as it is bymany of the oldest monuments. And Bunsen brings irrefutable proofs of their age.From his researches, for instance, we learn that there was a line of sixty-onekings before the days of Moses, who preceded the Mosaic period by aclearly-traceable civilization of several thousand years. Thus we are warrantedin believing that the works of Hermes Trismegistus were extant many ages beforethe birth of the Jewish law-giver. \"Styli and inkstands were found on monumentsof the fourth Dynasty, the oldest in the world,\" says Bunsen. If the eminentEgyptologist rejects the period of 48,863 years before Alexander, to whichDiogenes Laertius carries back the records of the priests, he is evidently moreembarrassed with the ten thousand of astronomical observations, and remarks that\"if they were actual observations, they must have extended over 10,000 years\"(p. 14). \"We learn, however,\" he adds, \"from one of their own old chronologicalworks . . . that the genuine Egyptian traditions concerning the mythologicalperiod, treated of myriads of years.\" (\"Egypte,\" i, p. 15). 34:* Higgins: \"Anacalypsis.\" 35:* \"De Vite Pythag.\" 36:* \"The Rosicrucians,\" etc., by Hargrave Jennings.

It is our decidedimpression and conviction, that to become a genuine spiritual entity, which thatdesignation implies, man must first create himself anew, so to speak--i.e.,thoroughly eliminate from his mind and spirit, not only the dominating influenceof selfishness and other impurity, but also the infection of superstition andprejudice. The latter is far different from what we commonly term antipathy orsympathy. We are at first irresistibly or unwittingly drawn within its darkcircle by that peculiar influence, that powerful current of magnetism whichemanates from ideas as well as from physical bodies. By this we are surrounded,and finally prevented through moral cowardice--fear of public opinion--fromstepping out of it. It is rare that men regard a thing in either its true orfalse light, accepting the conclusion by the free action of their own judgment.Quite the reverse. The conclusion is more commonly reached by blindly adoptingthe opinion current at the hour among those with whom they associate. A churchmember will not pay an absurdly high price for his pew any more than amaterialist will go twice to listen to Mr. Huxley's talk on evolution, becausethey think that it is right to do so; but merely because Mr. and Mrs. So-and-sohave done it, and these personages are THE S---- AND S----'s. The same holds good with everything else. If psychology had had its Darwin, thedescent of man as regards moral qualities might have been found inseparablylinked with that of his physical form. Society in its servile condition suggeststo the intelligent observer of its mimicry a kinship between the Simia and humanbeings even more striking than is exhibited in the external marks pointed out bythe great anthropologist. The many varieties of the ape--\"mocking presentments of ourselves\"--appear tohave been evolved on purpose to supply a certain class of expensively-dressedpersons with the material for genealogical trees. Science is daily and rapidly moving toward the great discoveries in chemistryand physics, organology, and anthropology. Learned men ought to be free frompreconceptions and prejudices of every kind; yet, although thought and opinionare now free, scientists are still the same men as of old. An Utopian dreamer ishe who thinks that man ever changes with the evolution and development of newideas. The soil may be well fertilized and made to yield with every year agreater and better variety of fruit; but, dig a little deeper than the stratumrequired for the crop, and the same earth will be found in the subsoil as wasthere before the first furrow was turned. Not many years ago, the person who questioned the infallibility of sometheological dogma was branded at once an iconoclast and an infidel. Vae victis!. . . Science has conquered. But in its turn the victor claims the sameinfallibility, though it equally fails to prove its right. \"Tempora mutantur etnos mutamur in illis,\" the saying of the good old Lotharius, applies to thecase. Nevertheless, we feel as if we had some right to question the high-priestsof science. For many years we have watched the development and growth of that apple ofdiscord--MODERN SPIRITUALISM. Familiar with its literature both in Europe andAmerica, we have closely and eagerly witnessed its interminable controversiesand compared its contradictory hypotheses. Many educated men andwomen--heterodox spiritualists, of course--have tried to fathom the Proteanphenomena. The only result was that they came to the following conclusion:whatever may be the reason of these constant failures--whether such are to belaid at the door of the investigators themselves, or of the secret Force atwork--it is at least proved that, in proportion as the psychologicalmanifestations increase in frequency and variety, the darkness surrounding theirorigin becomes more impenetrable. That phenomena are actually witnessed, mysterious in their nature--generally andperhaps wrongly termed spiritual--it is now idle to deny. Allowing a largediscount for clever fraud, what remains is quite serious enough to demand thecareful scrutiny of science. \"E pur se muove,\" the sentence spoken ages since,has passed into the category of household words. The courage of Galileo is notnow required to fling it into the face of the Academy. Psychological phenomenaare already on the offensive. The position assumed by modern scientists is that even though the occurrence ofcertain mysterious phenomena in the presence of the mediums be a fact, there isno proof that they are not due to some abnormal nervous condition of thoseindividuals. The possibility that they may be produced by returning humanspirits need not be considered until the other question is decided. Littleexception can be taken to this position. Unquestionably, the burden of proofrests upon those who assert the agency of spirits. If the scientists wouldgrapple with the subject in good faith, showing an earnest desire to solve theperplexing mystery, instead of treating it with undignified and unprofessionalcontempt, they would be open to no censure. True, the great majority of\"spiritual\" communications are calculated to disgust investigators of evenmoderate intelligence. Even when genuine they are trivial, commonplace, andoften vulgar. During the past twenty years we have received through variousmediums messages purporting to be from Shakespere, Byron, Franklin, Peter theGreat, Napoleon and Josephine, and even from Voltaire. The general impressionmade upon us was that the French conqueror and his consort seemed to haveforgotten how to spell words correctly; Shakespere and Byron had become chronicinebriates; and Voltaire had turned an imbecile. Who can blame men trained tohabits of exactitude, or even simply well-educated persons, for hastilyconcluding that when so much palpable fraud lies upon the surface, there couldhardly be truth if they should go to the bottom? The huckstering about ofpompous names attached to idiotic communications has given the scientificstomach such an indigestion that it cannot assimilate even the great truth whichlies on the telegraphic plateaux of this ocean of psychological phenomena. Theyjudge by its surface, covered with froth and scum. But they might with equalpropriety deny that there is any clear water in the depths of the sea when anoily scum was floating upon the surface. Therefore, if on one hand we cannotvery well blame them for stepping back at the first sight of what seems reallyrepulsive, we do, and have a right to censure them for their unwillingness toexplore deeper. Neither pearls nor cut diamonds are to be found lying loose onthe ground; and these persons act as unwisely as would a professional diver, whoshould reject an oyster on account of its filthy and slimy appearance, when byopening it he might find a precious pearl inside the shell. Even the just and severe rebukes of some of their leading men are of no availand the fear on the part of men of science to investigate such an unpopularsubject, seems to have now become a general panic. \"The phenomena chase thescientists, and the scientists run away from the phenomena,\" very pointedlyremarks M. A. N. Aksakof in an able article on Mediumism and the St. PetersburgScientific Committee. The attitude of this body of professors toward the subjectwhich they had pledged themselves to investigate was throughout simplydisgraceful. Their premature and prearranged report was so evidently partial andinconclusive as to call out a scornful protest even from unbelievers. The inconsistency of the logic of our learned gentlemen against the philosophyof spiritualism proper is admirably pointed out by Professor John Fisk--one oftheir own body. In a recent philosophical work, The Unseen World, while showingthat from the very definition of the terms, ,matter and spirit, the existence ofspirit cannot be demonstrated to the senses, and that thus no theory is amenableto scientific tests, he deals a severe blow at his colleagues in the followinglines: \"The testimony in such a case,\" he says, \"must, under the conditions of thepresent life, be forever inaccessible. It lies wholly outside the range ofexperience. However abundant it may be, we cannot expect to meet it. And,accordingly, our failure to produce it does not raise even the slightestpresumption against our theory. When conceived in this way, the belief in thefuture life is without scientific support, but at the same time it is placedbeyond the need of scientific support and the range of scientific criticism. Itis a belief which no imaginable future advance of physical discovery can in anyway impugn. It is a belief which is in no sense irrational, and which may belogically entertained without in the least affecting our scientific habit ofmind, or influencing our scientific conclusions.\" \"If now,\" he adds, \"men ofscience will accept the position that spirit is not matter, nor governed by thelaws of matter, and refrain from speculations concerning it restricted by theirknowledge of material things, they will withdraw what is to men of religion, atpresent, their principal cause of irritation.\" But, they will do no such thing. They feel incensed at the brave, loyal, andhighly commendable surrender of such superior men as Wallace, and refuse toaccept even the prudent and restrictive policy of Mr. Crookes. No other claim is advanced for a hearing of the opinions contained in thepresent work than that they are based upon many years' study of both ancientmagic and its modern form, Spiritualism. The former, even now, when phenomena ofthe same nature have become so familiar to all, is commonly set down as cleverjugglery. The latter, when overwhelming evidence precludes the possibility oftruthfully declaring it charlatanry, is denominated an universal hallucination. Many years of wandering among \"heathen\" and \"Christian\" magicians, occultists,mesmerisers; and the tutti quanti of white and black art, ought to besufficient, we think, to give us a certain right to feel competent to take apractical view of this doubted and very complicated question. We have associatedwith the fakirs, the holy men of India, and seen them when in intercourse withthe Pitris. We have watched the proceedings and modus operandi of the howlingand dancing dervishes; held friendly communications with the marabouts ofEuropean and Asiatic Turkey; and the serpent-charmers of Damascus and Benareshave but few secrets that we have not had the fortune to study. Therefore, whenscientists who have never had an opportunity of living among these orientaljugglers and can judge at the best but superficially, tell us that there isnaught in their performances but mere tricks of prestidigitation, we cannot helpfeeling a profound regret for such hasty conclusions. That such pretentiousclaims should be made to a thorough analysis of the powers of nature, and at thesame time such unpardonable neglect displayed of questions of purelyphysiological and psychological character, and astounding phenomena rejectedwithout either examination or appeal, is an exhibition of inconsistency,strongly savoring of timidity, if not of moral obliquity. If, therefore, we should ever receive from some contemporaneous Faraday the samefling that that gentleman made years since, when, with more sincerity than goodbreeding, he said that \"many dogs have the power of coming to much more logicalconclusions than some spiritualists,\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu001.htm#fn_58] we fear we must stillpersist. Abuse is not argument, least of all, proof. Because such men as Huxleyand Tyndall denominate spiritualism \"a degrading belief\" and oriental magic\"jugglery,\" they cannot thereby take from truth its verity. Skepticism, whetherit proceeds from a scientific or an ignorant brain, is unable to overturn theimmortality of our souls--if such immortality is a fact--and plunge them intopost-mortem annihilation. \"Reason is subject to error,\" says Aristotle; so isopinion; and the personal views of the most learned philosopher are often moreliable to be proved erroneous, than the plain common sense of his own illiteratecook. In the Tales of the Impious Khalif, Barrachias-Hassan-Oglu, the Arabiansage holds a wise discourse: \"Beware, O my son, of self-incense,\" he says. \"Itis the most dangerous, on account of its agreeable intoxication. Profit by thyown wisdom, but learn to respect the wisdom of thy fathers likewise. Andremember, O my beloved, that the light of Allah's truth will often penetratemuch easier an empty head, than one that is so crammed with learning that many asilver ray is crowded out for want of space; . . . such is the case with ourover-wise Kadi.\" These representatives of modern science in both hemispheres seem never to haveexhibited more scorn, or to have felt more bitterly toward the unsolvablemystery, than since Mr. Crookes began the investigation of the phenomena, inLondon. This courageous gentleman was the first to introduce to the public oneof those alleged \"materialized\" sentries that guard the forbidden gates.Following after him, several other learned members of the scientific body hadthe rare integrity, combined with a degree of courage, which, in view of theunpopularity of the subject, may be deemed heroic, to take the phenomena inhand. But, alas! although the spirit, indeed, was willing, the mortal flesh provedweak. Ridicule was more than the majority of them could bear; and so, theheaviest burden was thrown upon the shoulders of Mr. Crookes. An account of thebenefit this gentleman reaped from his disinterested investigations, and thethanks he received from his own brother scientists, can be found in his threepamphlets, entitled, Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism. After a while, the members appointed on the Committee of the Dialectical Societyand Mr. Crookes, who had applied to his mediums the most crucial tests, wereforced by an impatient public to report in so many plain words what they hadseen. But what could they say, except the truth? Thus, they were compelled toacknowledge: 1st. That the phenomena which they, at least, had witnessed, weregenuine, and impossible to simulate; thus showing that manifestations producedby some unknown force, could and did happen. 2d. That, whether the phenomenawere produced by disembodied spirits or other analogous entities, they could nottell; but that manifestations, thoroughly upsetting many preconceived theoriesas to natural laws, did happen and were undeniable. Several of these occurred intheir own families. 3d. That, notwithstanding all their combined efforts to thecontrary, beyond the indisputable fact of the reality of the phenomena,\"glimpses of natural action not yet reduced to law,\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu001.htm#fn_59] they, to borrow theexpression of the Count de Gabalis, \"could make neither head nor tail on't.\" Now this was precisely what a skeptical public had not bargained for. Thediscomfiture of the believers in spiritualism had been impatiently anticipatedbefore the conclusions of Messrs. Crookes, Varley, and the Dialectical Societywere announced. Such a confession on the part of their brother-scientists wastoo humiliating for the pride of even those who had timorously abstained frominvestigation. It was regarded as really too much, that such vulgar andrepulsive manifestations of phenomena which had always, by common consent ofeducated people, been regarded as nursery tales, fit only to amuse hystericalservant-girls and afford revenue to professional somnambulists--thatmanifestations which had been consigned by the Academy and Institute of Paris tooblivion, should so impertinently elude detection at the hands of experts inphysical sciences. A tornado of indignation followed the confession. Mr. Crookes depicts it in hispamphlet on Psychic Force. He heads it very pointedly with the quotation fromGalvani: \"I am attacked by two very opposite sects--the scientists and theknow-nothings, yet I know that I have discovered one of the greatest forces innature. . . .\" He then proceeds: \"It was taken for granted that the results of my experiments would be inaccordance with their preconceptions. What they really desired was not thetruth, but an additional witness in favor of their own foregone conclusions.When they found the facts which that investigation established could not be madeto fit those opinions, why, . . . so much the worse for the facts. They try tocreep out of their own confident recommendations of the inquiry, by declaring'that Mr. Home is a clever conjurer who has duped us all.' 'Mr. Crookes might,with equal propriety, examine the performances of an Indian juggler.' 'Mr.Crookes must get better witnesses before he can be believed.' 'The thing is tooabsurd to be treated seriously.' 'It is impossible, and therefore can't be.' . .. (I never said it was impossible, I only said it was true.) 'The observers haveall been biologized, and fancy they saw things occur which really never tookplace,' etc., etc., etc.\" * After expending their energy on such puerile theories as \"unconsciouscerebration,\" \"involuntary muscular contraction,\" and the sublimely ridiculousone of the \"cracking knee-joints\" (le muscle craqueur); after meetingignominious failures by the obstinate survival of the new force, and finally,after every desperate effort to compass its obliteration, these filiidiffidentiae--as St. Paul calls their class--thought best to give up the wholething in disgust. Sacrificing their courageously persevering brethren as aholocaust on the altar of public opinion, they withdrew in dignified silence.Leaving the arena of investigation to more fearless champions, these unluckyexperimenters are not likely to ever enter it again. ** It is easier by far todeny the reality of such manifestations from a secure distance, than find forthem a proper place among the classes of natural phenomena accepted by exactscience. And how can they, since all such phenomena pertain to psychology, andthe latter, with its occult and mysterious powers, is a terra incognita formodern science. Thus, powerless to explain that which proceeds directly from thenature of the human soul itself--the existence of which most of themdeny--unwilling at the same time to confess their ignorance, scientistsretaliate very unjustly on those who believe in the evidence of their senseswithout any pretence to science. \"A kick from thee, O Jupiter! is sweet,\" says the poet Tretiakowsky, in an oldRussian tragedy. Rude as those Jupiters of science may be occasionally toward uscredulous mortals, their vast learning--in less abstruse questions, we mean--ifnot their manners, entitles them to public respect. But unfortunately it is notthe gods who shout the loudest. The eloquent Tertullian, speaking of Satan and his imps, whom he accuses of evermimicking the Creator's works, denominates them the \"monkeys of God.\" It isfortunate for the philosophicules that we have no modern Tertullian to consignthem to an immortality of contempt as the \"monkeys of science.\" But to return to genuine scientists. \"Phenomena of a merely objectivecharacter,\" says A. N. Aksakof, \"force themselves upon the representatives ofexact sciences for investigation and explanation; but the high-priests ofscience, in the face of apparently such a simple question . . . are totallydisconcerted! This subject seems to have the privilege of forcing them tobetray, not only the highest code of morality--truth, but also the supreme lawof science--experiment! . . . They feel that there is something too seriousunderlying it. The cases of Hare, Crookes, de Morgan, Varley, Wallace, andButleroff create a panic! They fear that as soon as they concede one step, theywill have to yield the whole ground. Time-honored principles, the contemplativespeculations of a whole life, of a long line of generations, are all staked on asingle card!\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu001.htm#fn_62] In the face of such experience as that of Crookes and the Dialectical Society,of Wallace and the late Professor Hare, what can we expect from our luminariesof erudition? Their attitude toward the undeniable phenomena is in itselfanother phenomenon. It is simply incomprehensible, unless we admit thepossibility of another psychological disease, as mysterious and contagious ashydrophobia. Although we claim no honor for this new discovery, we neverthelesspropose to recognize it under the name of scientific psychophobia. They ought to have learned by this time, in the school of bitter experience,that they can rely on the self-sufficiency of the positive sciences only to acertain point; and that, so long as there remains one single unexplained mysteryin nature, the word \"impossible\" is a dangerous word for them to pronounce. In the Researches on the Phenomena of Spiritualism, Mr. Crookes submits to theoption of the reader eight theories \"to account for the phenomena observed.\" These theories run as follows: \"First Theory.--The phenomena are all the result of tricks, clever mechanicalarrangements, or legerdemain; the mediums are impostors, and the rest of thecompany fools. \"Second Theory.--The persons at a seance are the victims of a sort of mania, ordelusion, and imagine phenomena to occur which have no real objective existence. \"Third Theory.--The whole is the result of conscious or unconscious cerebralaction. \"Fourth Theory.--The result of the spirit of the medium, perhaps in associationwith the spirits of some or all of the people present. \"Fifth Theory.--The actions of evil spirits, or devils, personifying whom orwhat they please, in order to undermine Christianity, and ruin men's souls.(Theory of our theologians.) \"Sixth Theory.--The actions of a separate order of beings living on this earth,but invisible and immaterial to us. Able, however, occasionally to manifesttheir presence, known in almost all countries and ages as demons (notnecessarily bad), gnomes, fairies, kobolds, elves, goblins, Puck, etc. (One ofthe claims of the kabalists.) \"Seventh Theory.--The actions of departed human beings. (The spiritual theorypar excellence.) \"Eighth Theory.--(The psychic force) . . . an adjunct to the fourth, fifth,sixth, and seventh theories.\" The first of these theories having been proved valid only in exceptional, thoughunfortunately still too frequent cases, must be ruled out as having no materialbearing upon the phenomena themselves. Theories the second and the third are thelast crumbling entrenchments of the guerilla of skeptics and materialists, andremain, as lawyers say, \"Adhuc sub judice lis est.\" Thus, we can deal in thiswork but with the four remaining ones, the last, eighth, theory being accordingto Mr. Crookes's opinion, but \"a necessary adjunct\" of the others. How subject even a scientific opinion is to error, we may see, if we onlycompare the several articles on spiritual phenomena from the able pen of thatgentleman, which appeared from 1870 to 1875. In one of the first we read: . . .\"the increased employment of scientific methods will promote exact observationsand greater love of truths among inquirers, and will produce a race of observerswho will drive the worthless residuum of spiritualism hence into the unknownlimbo of magic and necromancy.\" And in 1875, we read, over his own signature,minute and most interesting descriptions of the materialized spirit--KatieKing! * It is hardly possible to suppose that Mr. Crookes could be underelectro-biological influence or hallucination for two or three consecutiveyears. The \"spirit\" appeared in his own house, in his library, under the mostcrucial tests, and was seen, felt, and heard by hundreds of persons. But Mr. Crookes denies that he ever took Katie King for a disembodied spirit.What was it then? If it was not Miss Florence Cook, and his word is oursufficient guarantee for it--then it was either the spirit of one who had livedon earth, or one of those that come directly under the sixth theory of the eightthe eminent scientist offers to the public choice. It must have been one of theclasses named: Fairies, Kobolds, Gnomes, Elves, Goblins, or a Puck. ** Yes; Katie King must have been a fairy--a Titania. For to a fairy only could beapplied with propriety the following poetic effusion which Mr. Crookes quotes indescribing this wonderful spirit: \"Round her she made an atmosphere of life;The very air seemed lighter from her eyes;They were so soft and beautiful and rifeWith all we can imagine of the skies;Her overpowering presence makes you feelIt would not be idolatry to kneel!\" ***And thus, after having written, in 1870, his severe sentence againstspiritualism and magic; after saying that even at that moment he believed \"thewhole affair a superstition, or, at least, an unexplained trick--a delusion ofthe senses;\" **** Mr. Crookes, in 1875, closes his letter with the followingmemorable words:--\"To imagine, I say, the Katie King of the last three years tobe the result of imposture does more violence to one's reason and common sensethan to believe her to be what she herself affirms.\" ***** This last remark,moreover, conclusively proves that: 1. Notwithstanding Mr. Crookes's full convictions that the somebody callingherself Katie King was neither the medium nor some confederate, but on thecontrary an unknown force in nature, which--like love--\"laughs at locksmiths\";2. That that hitherto unrecognized form of Force, albeit it had become with him\"not a matter of opinion, but of absolute knowledge,\"--the eminent investigatorstill did not abandon to the last his skeptical attitude toward the question. Inshort, he firmly believes in the phenomenon, but cannot accept the idea of itsbeing the human spirit of a departed somebody. It seems to us, that, as far as public prejudice goes, Mr. Crookes solves onemystery by creating a still deeper one: the obscurum per obscurius. In otherwords, rejecting \"the worthless residuum of spiritualism,\" the courageousscientist fearlessly plunges into his own \"unknown limbo of magic andnecromancy!\" The recognized laws of physical science account for but a few of the moreobjective of the so-called spiritual phenomena. While proving the reality ofcertain visible effects of an unknown force, they have not thus far enabledscientists to control at will even this portion of the phenomena. The truth isthat the professors have not yet discovered the necessary conditions of theiroccurrence. They must go as deeply into the study of the triple nature ofman--physiological, psychological, and divine--as did their predecessors, themagicians, theurgists, and thaumaturgists of old. Until the present moment, eventhose who have investigated the phenomena as thoroughly and impartially as Mr.Crookes, have set aside the cause as something not to be discovered now, ifever. They have troubled themselves no more about that than about the firstcause of the cosmic phenomena of the correlation of forces, whose endlesseffects they are at such pains to observe and classify. Their course has been asunwise as that of a man who should attempt to discover the sources of a river byexploring toward its mouth. It has so narrowed their views of the possibilitiesof natural law that very simple forms of occult phenomena have necessitatedtheir denial that they can occur unless miracles were possible; and this being ascientific absurdity the result has been that physical science has latterly beenlosing prestige. If scientists had studied the so-called \"miracles\" instead ofdenying them, many secret laws of nature comprehended by the ancients would havebeen again discovered. \"Conviction,\" says Bacon, \"comes not through argumentsbut through experiments.\" The ancients were always distinguished--especially the Chaldean astrologers andMagians--for their ardent love and pursuit of knowledge in every branch ofscience. They tried to penetrate the secrets of nature in the same way as ourmodern naturalists, and by the only method by which this object can be obtained,namely: by experimental researches and reason. If our modern philosophers cannotapprehend the fact that they penetrated deeper than themselves into themysteries of the universe, this does not constitute a valid reason why thecredit of possessing this knowledge should be denied them or the imputation ofsuperstition laid at their door. Nothing warrants the charge; and every newarchaeological discovery militates against the assumption. As chemists they wereunequalled, and in his famous lecture on The Lost Arts, Wendell Phillips says:\"The chemistry of the most ancient period had reached a point which we havenever even approached.\" The secret of the malleable glass, which, \"if supportedby one end by its own weight, in twenty hours dwindles down to a fine line thatyou can curve around your wrist,\" would be as difficult to rediscover in ourcivilized countries as to fly to the moon. The fabrication of a cup of glass which was brought by an exile to Rome in thereign of Tiberius,--a cup \"which he dashed upon the marble pavement, and it wasnot crushed nor broken by the fall,\" and which, as it got \"dented some\" waseasily brought into shape again with a hammer, is a historic fact. If it isdoubted now it is merely because the moderns cannot do the same. And yet, inSamarkand and some monasteries of Thibet such cups and glass-ware may be foundto this day; nay, there are persons who claim that they can make the same byvirtue of their knowledge of the much-ridiculed and ever-doubted alkahest--theuniversal solvent. This agent that Paracelsus and Van Helmont maintain to be acertain fluid in nature, \"capable of reducing all sublunary bodies, as wellhomogeneous as mixed, into their ens primum, or the original matter of whichthey are composed; or into an uniform, equable, and potable liquor, that willunite with water, and the juices of all bodies, and yet retain its own radicalvirtues; and, if again mixed with itself will thereby be converted into pureelementary water\": what impossibilities prevent our crediting the statement? Whyshould it not exist and why the idea be considered Utopian? Is it again becauseour modern chemists are unable to produce it? But surely it may be conceivedwithout any great effort of imagination that all bodies must have originallycome from some first matter, and that this matter, according to the lessons ofastronomy, geology and physics, must have been a fluid. Why should not gold--ofwhose genesis our scientists know so little--have been originally a primitive orbasic matter of gold, a ponderous fluid which, as says Van Helmont, \"from itsown nature, or a strong cohesion between its particles, acquired afterward asolid form?\" There seems to be very little absurdity to believe in a \"universal ens thatresolves all bodies into their ens genitale.\" Van Helmont calls it \"the highestand most successful of all salts; which having obtained the supreme degree ofsimplicity, purity, subtilty, enjoys alone the faculty of remaining unchangedand unimpaired by the subjects it works upon, and of dissolving the moststubborn and untractable bodies; as stones, gems, glass, earth, sulphur, metals,etc., into red salt, equal in weight to the matter dissolved; and this with asmuch ease as hot water melts down snow.\" It is into this fluid that the makers of malleable glass claimed, and now claim,that they immersed common glass for several hours, to acquire the property ofmalleability. We have a ready and palpable proof of such possibilities. A foreigncorrespondent of the Theosophical Society, a well-known medical practitioner,and one who has studied the occult sciences for upward of thirty years, hassucceeded in obtaining what he terms the \"true oil of gold,\" i.e., the primalelement. Chemists and physicists have seen and examined it, and were driven toconfess that they neither knew how it was obtained nor could they do the same.That he desires his name to remain unknown is not to be wondered at; ridiculeand public prejudice are more dangerous sometimes than the inquisition of old.This \"Adamic earth\" is next-door neighbor to the alkahest, and one of the mostimportant secrets of the alchemists. No Kabalist will reveal it to the world,for, as he expresses it in the well-known jargon: \"it would explain the eaglesof the alchemists, and how the eagles' wings are clipped,\" a secret that it tookThomas Vaughan (Eugenius Philalethes) twenty years to learn. As the dawn of physical science broke into a glaring day-light, the spiritualsciences merged deeper and deeper into night, and in their turn they weredenied. So, now, these greatest masters in psychology are looked upon as\"ignorant and superstitious ancestors\"; as mountebanks and jugglers, because,forsooth, the sun of modern learning shines to-day so bright, it has become anaxiom that the philosophers and men of science of the olden time knew nothing,and lived in a night of superstition. But their traducers forget that the sun ofto-day will seem dark by comparison with the luminary of to-morrow, whetherjustly or not; and as the men of our century think their ancestors ignorant, sowill perhaps their descendants count them for know-nothings. The world moves incycles. The coming races will be but the reproductions of races long bygone; aswe, perhaps, are the images of those who lived a hundred centuries ago. The timewill come when those who now in public slander the hermetists, but ponder insecret their dust-covered volumes; who plagiarize their ideas, assimilate andgive them out as their own--will receive their dues. \"Who,\" honestly exclaimsPfaff--\"what man has ever taken more comprehensive views of nature thanParacelsus? He was the bold creator of chemical medicines; the founder ofcourageous parties; victorious in controversy, belonging to those spirits whohave created amongst us a new mode of thinking on the natural existence ofthings. What he scattered through his writings on the philosopher's stone, onpigmies and spirits of the mines; on signs, on homunculi, and the elixir oflife, and which are employed by many to lower his estimation, cannot extinguishour grateful remembrance of his general works, nor our admiration of his free,bold exertions, and his noble, intellectual life.\" * More than one pathologist, chemist, homoeopathist, and magnetist has quenchedhis thirst for knowledge in the books of Paracelsus. Frederick Hufeland got histheoretical doctrines on infection from this mediaeval \"quack,\" as Sprengeldelights in calling one who was immeasurably higher than himself. Hemman, whoendeavors to vindicate this great philosopher, and nobly tries to redress hisslandered memory, speaks of him as the \"greatest chemist of his time.\" ** So doProfessor Molitor, *** and Dr. Ennemoser, the eminent German psychologist. ****According to their criticisms on the labors of this Hermetist, Paracelsus is themost \"wondrous intellect of his age,\" a \"noble genius.\" But our modern lightsassume to know better, and the ideas of the Rosicrucians about the elementaryspirits, the goblins and the elves, have sunk into the \"limbo of magic\" andfairy tales for early childhoods. ***** We are quite ready to concede to skeptics that one-half, and even more, ofseeming phenomena, are but more or less clever fraud. Recent exposures,especially of \"materializing\" mediums, but too well prove the fact.Unquestionably numerous others are still in store, and this will continue untiltests have become so perfect and spiritualists so reasonable as no longer tofurnish opportunity to mediums or weapons to adversaries. What should sensible spiritualists think of the character of angel guides, whoafter monopolizing, perhaps for years, a poor medium's time, health and means,suddenly abandon him when he most needs their help? None but creatures withoutsoul or conscience would be guilty of such injustice. Conditions?--Meresophistry. What sort of spirits must they be who would not summon if necessaryan army of spirit-friends (if such there be) to snatch the innocent medium fromthe pit dug for his feet? Such things happened in the olden time, such mayhappen now. There were apparitions before modern spiritualism, and phenomenalike ours in every previous age. If modern manifestations are a reality andpalpable facts, so must have been the so-called \"miracles\" and thaumaturgicexploits of old; or if the latter are but fictions of superstition so must bethe former, for they rest on no better testimony. But, in this daily-increasing torrent of occult phenomena that rushes from oneend of the globe to the other, though two-thirds of the manifestations areproved spurious, what of those which are proved genuine beyond doubt or cavil?Among these may be found communications coming through non-professional as wellas professional mediums, which are sublime and divinely grand. Often, throughyoung children, and simple-minded ignorant persons, we receive philosophicalteachings and precepts, poetry and inspirational orations, music and paintingsthat are fully worthy of the reputations of their alleged authors. Theirprophecies are often verified and their moral disquisitions beneficent, thoughthe latter is of rarer occurrence. Who are those spirits, what those powers orintelligences which are evidently outside of the medium proper and entities perse? These intelligences deserve the appellation; and they differ as widely fromthe generality of spooks and goblins that hover around the cabinets for physicalmanifestations, as day from night. We must confess that the situation appears to be very grave. The control ofmediums by such unprincipled and lying \"spirits\" is constantly becoming more andmore general; and the pernicious effects of seeming diabolism constantlymultiply. Some of the best mediums are abandoning the public rostrum andretiring from this influence; and the movement is drifting churchward. Weventure the prediction that unless spiritualists set about the study of ancientphilosophy, so as to learn to discriminate between spirits and to guardthemselves against the baser sort, twenty-five years more will not elapse beforethey will have to fly to the Romish communion to escape these \"guides\" and\"controls\" that they have fondled so long. The signs of this catastrophe alreadyexhibit themselves. At a recent convention at Philadelphia, it was seriouslyproposed to organize a sect of Christian Spiritualists! This is because, havingwithdrawn from the church and learned nothing of the philosophy of thephenomena, or the nature of their spirits, they are drifting about on a sea ofuncertainty like a ship without compass or rudder. They cannot escape thedilemma; they must choose between Porphyry and Pio Nono. While men of genuine science, such as Wallace, Crookes, Wagner, Butlerof,Varley, Buchanan, Hare, Reichenbach, Thury, Perty, de Morgan, Hoffmann,Goldschmidt, W. Gregory, Flammarion, Sergeant Cox and many others, firmlybelieve in the current phenomena, many of the above named reject the theory ofdeparted spirits. Therefore, it seems but logical to think that if the London\"Katie King,\" the only materialized something which the public is obliged moreor less to credit out of respect to science,--is not the spirit of an ex-mortal,then it must be the astral solidified shadow of either one of the Rosicrucianspooks--\"fantasies of superstition\"--or of some as yet unexplained force innature. Be it however a \"spirit of health or goblin damn'd\" it is of littleconsequence; for if it be once proved that its organism is not solid matter,then it must be and is a \"spirit,\" an apparition, a breath. It is anintelligence which acts outside our organisms and therefore must belong to someexisting even though unseen race of beings. But what is it? What is thissomething which thinks and even speaks but yet is not human; that is impalpableand yet not a disembodied spirit; that simulates affection, passion, remorse,fear, joy, but yet feels neither? What is this canting creature which rejoicesin cheating the truthful inquirer and mocking at sacred human feeling? For, ifnot Mr. Crookes's Katie King, other similar creatures have done all these. Whocan fathom the mystery? The true psychologist alone. And where should he go forhis text-books but to the neglected alcoves of libraries where the works ofdespised hermetists and theurgists have been gathering dust these many years. Says Henry More, the revered English Platonist, in his answer to an attack onthe believers of spiritual and magic phenomena by a skeptic of that age, namedWebster: * \"As for that other opinion, that the greater part of the reformeddivines hold, that it was the Devil that appeared in Samuel's shape, it isbeneath contempt; for though I do not doubt but that in many of thesenecromantic apparitions, they are ludicrous spirits, not the souls of thedeceased that appear, yet I am clear for the appearing of the soul of Samuel,and as clear that in other necromancies, it may be such kinds of spirits, asPorphyrius above describes, 'that change themselves into omnifarious forms andshapes, and one while act the parts of daemons, another while of angels or gods,and another while of the souls of the departed.' And I confess such a spirit asthis might personate Samuel here, for anything Webster alleged to the contrary,for his arguments indeed are wonderfully weak and wooden.\" When such a metaphysician and philosopher as Henry More gives such testimony asthis, we may well assume our point to have been well taken. Learnedinvestigators, all very skeptical as to spirits in general and \"departed humanspirits\" in particular, during the last twenty years have taxed their brains toinvent new names for an old thing. Thus, with Mr. Crookes and Sergeant Cox, itis the \"psychic force.\" Professor Thury of Geneva calls it the \"psychode\" orectenic force; Professor Balfour Stewart, the \"electro-biological power\";Faraday, the \"great master of experimental philosophy in physics,\" butapparently a novice in psychology, superciliously termed it an \"unconsciousmuscular action,\" an \"unconscious cerebration,\" and what not? Sir WilliamHamilton, a \"latent thought\"; Dr. Carpenter, \"the ideo-motor principle,\" etc.,etc. So many scientists--so many names. Years ago the old German philosopher, Schopenhauer, disposed of this force andmatter at the same time; and since the conversion of Mr. Wallace, the greatanthropologist has evidently adopted his ideas. Schopenhauer's doctrine is thatthe universe is but the manifestation of the will. Every force in nature is alsoan effect of will, representing a higher or lower degree of its objectiveness.It is the teaching of Plato, who stated distinctly that everything visible wascreated or evolved out of the invisible and eternal WILL, and after its fashion.Our Heaven--he says--was produced according to the eternal pattern of the \"IdealWorld,\" contained, as everything else, in the dodecahedron, the geometricalmodel used by the Deity. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu001.htm#fn_74]With Plato, the Primal Being is an emanation of the Demiurgic Mind (Nous), whichcontains from the eternity the \"idea\" of the \"to be created world\" withinitself, and which idea he produces out of himself. ** The laws of nature are theestablished relations of this idea to the forms of its manifestations; \"theseforms,\" says Schopenhauer, \"are time, space, and causality. Through time andspace the idea varies in its numberless manifestations.\" These ideas are far from being new, and even with Plato they were not original.This is what we read in the Chaldean Oracles: * \"The works of nature co-existwith the intellectual νοεριο, spiritual Light of the Father. For it is the soulψυχε which adorned the great heaven, and which adorns it after the Father.\" \"The incorporeal world then was already completed, having its seat in the DivineReason,\" says Philo ** [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu001.htm#fn_77] whois erroneously accused of deriving his philosophy from Plato's. In the Theogony of Mochus, we find Æther first, and then the air; the twoprinciples from which Ulom, the intelligible νοετος God (the visible universe ofmatter) is born. *** In the Orphic hymns, the Eros-Phanes evolves from the Spiritual Egg, which theÆthereal winds impregnate, Wind **** being \"the spirit of God,\" who is said tomove in Æther, \"brooding over the Chaos\"--the Divine \"Idea.\" In the HinduKatakopanisad, Purusha, the Divine Spirit, already stands before the originalmatter, from whose union springs the great Soul of the World, \"Maha =Atma,Brahm, the Spirit of Life\"; ***** these latter appellations are identical withthe Universal Soul, or Anima Mundi, and the Astral Light of the theurgists andkabalists. Pythagoras brought his doctrines from the eastern sanctuaries, and Platocompiled them into a form more intelligible than the mysterious numerals of thesage--whose doctrines he had fully embraced--to the uninitiated mind. Thus, theCosmos is \"the Son\" with Plato, having for his father and mother the DivineThought and Matter. ****** \"The Egyptians,\" says Dunlap, ******* \"distinguish between an older and youngerHorus, the former the brother of Osiris, the latter the son of Osiris and Isis.\"The first is the Idea of the world remaining in the Demiurgic Mind, \"born indarkness before the creation of the world.\" The second Horus is this \"Idea\"going forth from the Logos, becoming clothed with matter, and assuming an actualexistence. ******** \"The mundane God, eternal, boundless, young and old, of winding form,\" ********* say the Chaldean Oracles. This \"winding form\" is a figure to express the vibratory motion of the AstralLight, with which the ancient priests were perfectly well acquainted, thoughthey may have differed in views of ether, with modern scientists; for in theÆther they placed the Eternal Idea pervading the Universe, or the Will whichbecomes Force, and creates or organizes matter. \"The will,\" says Van Helmont, \"is the first of all powers. For through the willof the Creator all things were made and put in motion. . . . The will is theproperty of all spiritual beings, and displays itself in them the more activelythe more they are freed from matter.\" And Paracelsus, \"the divine,\" as he wascalled, adds in the same strain: \"Faith must confirm the imagination, for faithestablishes the will. . . . Determined will is a beginning of all magicaloperations. . . . Because men do not perfectly imagine and believe the result,is that the arts are uncertain, while they might be perfectly certain.\" The opposing power alone of unbelief and skepticism, if projected in a currentof equal force, can check the other, and sometimes completely neutralize it. Whyshould spiritualists wonder that the presence of some strong skeptics, or ofthose who, feeling bitterly opposed to the phenomenon, unconsciously exercisetheir will-power in opposition, hinders and often stops altogether themanifestations? If there is no conscious power on earth but sometimes findsanother to interfere with or even counterbalance it, why wonder when theunconscious, passive power of a medium is suddenly paralyzed in its effects byanother opposing one, though it also be as unconsciously exercised? ProfessorsFaraday and Tyndall boasted that their presence at a circle would stop at onceevery manifestation. This fact alone ought to have proved to the eminentscientists that there was some force in these phenomena worthy to arrest theirattention. As a scientist, Prof. Tyndall was perhaps pre-eminent in the circleof those who were present at the seance; as a shrewd observer, one not easilydeceived by a tricking medium, he was perhaps no better, if as clever, as othersin the room, and if the manifestations were but a fraud so ingenious as todeceive the others, they would not have stopped, even on his account. Whatmedium can ever boast of such phenomena as were produced by Jesus, and theapostle Paul after him? Yet even Jesus met with cases where the unconsciousforce of resistance overpowered even his so well directed current of will. \"Andhe did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.\" There is a reflection of every one of these views in Schopenhauer's philosophy.Our \"investigating\" scientists might consult his works with profit. They willfind therein many a strange hypothesis founded on old ideas, speculations on the\"new\" phenomena, which may prove as reasonable as any, and be saved the uselesstrouble of inventing new theories. The psychic and ectenic forces, the\"ideo-motor\" and \"electro-biological powers\"; \"latent thought\" and even\"unconscious cerebration\" theories, can be condensed in two words: thekabalistic ASTRAL LIGHT. The bold theories and opinions expressed in Schopenhauer's works differ widelywith those of the majority of our orthodox scientists. \"In reality,\" remarksthis daring speculator, \"there is neither matter nor spirit. The tendency togravitation in a stone is as unexplainable as thought in human brain. . . . Ifmatter can--no one knows why--fall to the ground, then it can also--no one knowswhy--think. . . . As soon, even in mechanics, as we trespass beyond the purelymathematical, as soon as we reach the inscrutable, adhesion, gravitation, and soon, we are faced by phenomena which are to our senses as mysterious as the WILLand THOUGHT in man--we find ourselves facing the incomprehensible, for such isevery force in nature. Where is then that matter which you all pretend to knowso well; and from which--being so familiar with it--you draw all yourconclusions and explanations, and attribute to it all things? . . . That, whichcan be fully realized by our reason and senses, is but the superficial: they cannever reach the true inner substance of things. Such was the opinion of Kant. Ifyou consider that there is in a human head some sort of a spirit, then you areobliged to concede the same to a stone. If your dead and utterly passive mattercan manifest a tendency toward gravitation, or, like electricity, attract andrepel, and send out sparks--then, as well as the brain, it can also think. Inshort, every particle of the so-called spirit, we can replace with an equivalentof matter, and every particle of matter replace with spirit. . . . Thus, it isnot the Cartesian division of all things into matter and spirit that can ever befound philosophically exact; but only if we divide them into will andmanifestation, which form of division has naught to do with the former, for itspiritualizes every thing: all that, which is in the first instance real andobjective--body and matter--it transforms into a representation, and everymanifestation into will.\" * These views corroborate what we have expressed about the various names given tothe same thing. The disputants are battling about mere words. Call the phenomenaforce, energy, electricity or magnetism, will, or spirit-power, it will ever bethe partial manifestation of the soul, whether disembodied or imprisoned for awhile in its body--of a portion of that intelligent, omnipotent, and individualWILL, pervading all nature, and known, through the insufficiency of humanlanguage to express correctly psychological images, as--GOD. The ideas of some of our schoolmen about matter are, from the kabalisticstanding-point, in many a way erroneous. Hartmann calls their views \"aninstinctual prejudice.\" Furthermore, he demonstrates that no experimenter canhave anything to do with matter properly termed, but only with the forces intowhich he divides it. The visible effects of matter are but the effects of force.He concludes thereby, that that which is now called matter is nothing but theaggregation of atomic forces, to express which the word matter is used: outsideof that, for science matter is but a word void of sense. Notwithstanding many anhonest confession on the part of our specialists--physicists, physiologists andchemists--that they know nothing whatever of matter, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu001.htm#fn_86] they deify it. Every newphenomenon which they find themselves unable to explain, is triturated,compounded into incense, and burned on the altar of the goddess who patronizesmodern scientists. No one can better treat his subject than does Schopenhauer in his Parerga. Inthis work he discusses at length animal magnetism, clairvoyance, sympatheticcures, seership, magic, omens, ghost-seeing, and other spiritual matters. \"Allthese manifestations,\" he says, \"are branches of one and the same tree, andfurnish us with irrefutable proofs of the existence of a chain of beings whichis based on quite a different order of things than that nature which has at itsfoundation laws of space, time and adaptability. This other order of things isfar deeper, for it is the original and the direct one; in its presence thecommon laws of nature, which are simply formal, are unavailing; therefore, underits immediate action neither time nor space can separate any longer theindividuals, and the separation impendent on these forms presents no moreinsurmountable barriers for the intercourse of thoughts and the immediate actionof the will. In this manner changes may be wrought by quite a different coursethan the course of physical causality, i.e., through an action of themanifestation of the will exhibited in a peculiar way and outside the individualhimself. Therefore the peculiar character of all the aforesaid manifestations isthe visio in distante et actio in distante (vision and action at a distance) inits relation to time as well as in its relation to space. Such an action at adistance is just what constitutes the fundamental character of what is calledmagical; for such is the immediate action of our will, an action liberated fromthe causal conditions of physical action, viz., contact.\" \"Besides that,\" continues Schopenhauer, \"these manifestations present to us asubstantial and perfectly logical contradiction to materialism, and even tonaturalism, because in the light of such manifestations, that order of things innature which both these philosophies seek to present as absolute and the onlygenuine, appears before us on the contrary purely phenomenal and superficial,and containing at the bottom of it a substance of things a parte and perfectlyindependent of its own laws. That is why these manifestations--at least from apurely philosophical point of view--among all the facts which are presented tous in the domain of experiment, are beyond any comparison the most important.Therefore, it is the duty of every scientist to acquaint himself with them.\" * To pass from the philosophical speculations of a man like Schopenhauer to thesuperficial generalizations of some of the French Academicians, would beprofitless but for the fact that it enables us to estimate the intellectualgrasp of the two schools of learning. What the German makes of profoundpsychological questions, we have seen. Compare with it the best that theastronomer Babinet and the chemist Boussingault can offer by way of explainingan important spiritualistic phenomenon. In 1854-5 these distinguishedspecialists presented to the Academy a memoire, or monograph, whose evidentobject was to corroborate and at the same time make clearer Dr. Chevreuil's toocomplicated theory in explanation of the turning-tables, of the commission forthe investigation of which he was a member. Here it is verbatim: \"As to the movements and oscillations alleged to happenwith certain tables, they can have no cause other than the invisible andinvoluntary vibrations of the experimenter's muscular system; the extendedcontraction of the muscles manifesting itself at such time by a series ofvibrations, and becoming thus a visible tremor which communicates to the objecta circumrotary motion. This rotation is thus enabled to manifest itself with aconsiderable energy, by a gradually quickening motion, or by a strongresistance, whenever it is required to stop. Hence the physical explanation ofthe phenomenon becomes clear and does not offer the slightest difficulty.\" ** None whatever. This scientific hypothesis--or demonstration shall we say?--is asclear as one of M. Babinet's nebulae examined on a foggy night. And still, clear as it may be, it lacks an important feature, i.e., commonsense. We are at a loss to decide whether or not Babinet accepts en desespoir decause Hartmann's proposition that \"the visible effects of matter are nothing butthe effects of a force,\" and, that in order to form a clear conception ofmatter, one must first form one of force. The philosophy to the school of whichbelongs Hartmann, and which is partly accepted by several of the greatest Germanscientists, teaches that the problem of matter can only be solved by thatinvisible Force, acquaintance with which Schopenhauer terms the \"magicalknowledge,\" and \"magical effect or action of Will.\" Thus, we must firstascertain whether the \"involuntary vibrations of the experimenter's muscularsystem,\" which are but \"actions of matter,\" are influenced by a will within theexperimenter or without. In the former case Babinet makes of him an unconsciousepileptic; the latter, as we will further see, he rejects altogether, andattributes all intelligent answers of the tipping or rapping tables to\"unconscious ventriloquism.\" We know that every exertion of will results in force, and that, according to theabove-named German school, the manifestations of atomic forces are individualactions of will, resulting in the unconscious rushing of atoms into the concreteimage already subjectively created by the will. Democritus taught, after hisinstructor Leucippus, that the first principles of all things contained in theuniverse were atoms and a vacuum. In its kabalistic sense, the vacuum means inthis instance the latent Deity, or latent force, which at its firstmanifestation became WILL, and thus communicated the first impulse to theseatoms--whose agglomeration, is matter. This vacuum was but another name forchaos, and an unsatisfactory one, for, according to the Peripatetics \"natureabhors a vacuum.\" That before Democritus the ancients were familiar with the idea of theindestructibility of matter is proved by their allegories and numerous otherfacts. Movers gives a definition of the Phoenician idea of the ideal sun-lightas a spiritual influence issuing from the highest God, IAO, \"the lightconceivable only by intellect--the physical and spiritual Principle of allthings; out of which the soul emanates.\" It was the male Essence, or Wisdom,while the primitive matter or Chaos was the female. Thus the two firstprinciples--co-eternal and infinite, were already with the primitivePhoenicians, spirit and matter. Therefore the theory is as old as the world; forDemocritus was not the first philosopher who taught it; and intuition existed inman before the ultimate development of his reason. But it is in the denial ofthe boundless and endless Entity, possessor of that invisible Will which we forlack of a better term call GOD, that lies the powerlessness of everymaterialistic science to explain the occult phenomena. It is in the rejection apriori of everything which might force them to cross the boundary of exactscience and step into the domain of psychological, or, if we prefer,metaphysical physiology, that we find the secret cause of their discomfiture bythe manifestations, and their absurd theories to account for them. The ancientphilosophy affirmed that it is in consequence of the manifestation of thatWill--termed by Plato the Divine Idea--that everything visible and invisiblesprung into existence. As that Intelligent Idea, which, by directing its solewill-power toward a centre of localized forces called objective forms intobeing, so can man, the microcosm of the great Macrocosm, do the same inproportion with the development of his will-power. The imaginary atoms--a figureof speech employed by Democritus, and gratefully seized upon by thematerialists--are like automatic workmen moved inwardIy by the influx of thatUniversal Will directed upon them, and which, manifesting itself as force, setsthem into activity. The plan of the structure to be erected is in the brain ofthe Architect, and reflects his will; abstract as yet, from the instant of theconception it becomes concrete through these atoms which follow faithfully everyline, point and figure traced in the imagination of the Divine Geometer. As God creates, so man can create. Given a certain intensity of will, and theshapes created by the mind become subjective. Hallucinations, they are called,although to their creator they are real as any visible object is to any oneelse. Given a more intense and intelligent concentration of this will, and theform becomes concrete, visible, objective; the man has learned the secret ofsecrets; he is a MAGICIAN. The materialist should not object to this logic, for he regards thought asmatter. Conceding it to be so, the cunning mechanism contrived by the inventor;the fairy scenes born in the poet's brain; the gorgeous painting limned by theartist's fancy; the peerless statue chiselled in ether by the sculptor; thepalaces and castles built in air by the architect--all these, though invisibleand subjective, must exist, for they are matter, shaped and moulded. Who shallsay, then, that there are not some men of such imperial will as to be able todrag these air-drawn fancies into view, enveloped in the hard casing of grosssubstance to make them tangible? If the French scientists reaped no laurels in the new field of investigation,what more was done in England, until the day when Mr. Crookes offered himself inatonement for the sins of the learned body? Why, Mr. Faraday, some twenty yearsago, actually condescended to be spoken to once or twice upon the subject.Faraday, whose name is pronounced by the anti-spiritualists in every discussionupon the phenomena, as a sort of scientific charm against the evil-eye ofSpiritualism, Faraday, who \"blushed\" for having published his researches uponsuch a degrading belief, is now proved on good authority to have never sat at atipping table himself at all! We have but to open a few stray numbers of theJournal des Debats, published while a noted Scotch medium was in England, torecall the past events in all their primitive freshness. In one of thesenumbers, Dr. Foucault, of Paris, comes out as a champion for the eminent Englishexperimenter. \"Pray, do not imagine,\" says he, \"that the grand physicist hadever himself condescended so far as to sit prosaically at a jumping table.\"Whence, then, came the \"blushes\" which suffused the cheeks of the \"Father ofExperimental Philosophy\"? Remembering this fact, we will now examine the natureof Faraday's beautiful \"Indicator,\" the extraordinary \"Medium-Catcher,\" inventedby him for the detection of mediumistic fraud. That complicated machine, thememory of which haunts like a nightmare the dreams of dishonest mediums, iscarefully described in Comte de Mirville's Question des Esprits. The better to prove to the experimenters the reality of their own impulsion,Professor Faraday placed several card-board disks, united to each other andstuck to the table by a half-soft glue, which, making the whole adhere for atime together, would, nevertheless, yield to a continuous pressure. Now, thetable having turned--yes, actually having dared to turn before Mr. Faraday,which fact is of some value, at least--the disks were examined; and, as theywere found to have gradually displaced themselves by slipping in the samedirection as the table, it thus became an unquestionable proof that theexperimenters had pushed the tables themselves. Another of the so-called scientific tests, so useful in a phenomenon alleged tobe either spiritual or psychical, consisted of a small instrument whichimmediately warned the witnesses of the slightest personal impulsion on theirpart, or rather, according to Mr. Faraday's own expression, \"it warned them whenthey changed from the passive to the active state.\" This needle which betrayedthe active motion proved but one thing, viz.: the action of a force which eitheremanated from the sitters or controlled them. And who has ever said that thereis no such force? Every one admits so much, whether this force passes throughthe operator, as it is generally shown, or acts independently of him, as is sooften the case. \"The whole mystery consisted in the disproportion of the forceemployed by the operators, who pushed because they were forced to push, withcertain effects of rotation, or rather, of a really marvellous race. In thepresence of such prodigious effects, how could any one imagine that theLilliputian experiments of that kind could have any value in this newlydiscovered Land of Giants?\" * Professor Agassiz, who occupied in America nearly the same eminent position as ascientist which Mr. Faraday did in England, acted with a still greaterunfairness. Professor J. R. Buchanan, the distinguished anthropologist, who hastreated Spiritualism in some respects more scientifically than any one else inAmerica, speaks of Agassiz, in a recent article, with a very just indignation.For, of all other men, Professor Agassiz ought to believe in a phenomenon towhich he had been a subject himself. But now that both Faraday and Agassiz arethemselves disembodied, we can do better by questioning the living than thedead. Thus a force whose secret powers were thoroughly familiar to the ancienttheurgists, is denied by modern skeptics. The antediluvian children--who perhapsplayed with it, using it as the boys in Bulwer-Lytton's Coming Race, use thetremendous \"vril\"--called it the \"Water of Phtha\"; their descendants named itthe Anima Mundi, the soul of the universe; and still later the mediaevalhermetists termed it \"sidereal light,\" or the \"Milk of the Celestial Virgin,\"the \"Magnes,\" and many other names. But our modern learned men will neitheraccept nor recognize it under such appellations; for it pertains to magic, andmagic is, in their conception, a disgraceful superstition. Apollonius and Iamblichus held that it was not \"in the knowledge of thingswithout, but in the perfection of the soul within, that lies the empire of man,aspiring to be more than men.\" * Thus they had arrived at a perfect cognizanceof their godlike souls, the powers of which they used with all the wisdom,outgrowth of esoteric study of the hermetic lore, inherited by them from theirforefathers. But our philosophers, tightly shutting themselves up in theirshells of flesh, cannot or dare not carry their timid gaze beyond thecomprehensible. For them there is no future life; there are no godlike dreams,they scorn them as unscientific; for them the men of old are but \"ignorantancestors,\" as they express it; and whenever they meet during theirphysiological researches with an author who believes that this mysteriousyearning after spiritual knowledge is inherent in every human being, and cannothave been given us utterly in vain, they regard him with contemptuous pity. Says a Persian proverb: \"The darker the sky is, the brighter the stars willshine.\" Thus, on the dark firmament of the mediaeval ages began appearing themysterious Brothers of the Rosie Cross. They formed no associations, they builtno colleges; for, hunted up and down like so many wild beasts, when caught bythe Christian Church, they were unceremoniously roasted. \"As religion forbidsit,\" says Bayle, \"to spill blood,\" therefore, \"to elude the maxim, Ecclesia nonnovit sanguinem, they burned human beings, as burning a man does not shed hisblood!\" Many of these mystics, by following what they were taught by some treatises,secretly preserved from one generation to another, achieved discoveries whichwould not be despised even in our modern days of exact sciences. Roger Bacon,the friar, was laughed at as a quack, and is now generally numbered among\"pretenders\" to magic art; but his discoveries were nevertheless accepted, andare now used by those who ridicule him the most. Roger Bacon belonged by rightif not by fact to that Brotherhood which includes all those who study the occultsciences. Living in the thirteenth century, almost a contemporary, therefore, ofAlbertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, his discoveries--such as gunpowder andoptical glasses, and his mechanical achievements--were considered by every oneas so many miracles. He was accused of having made a compact with the Evil One. In the legendary history of Friar Bacon, as \"well as in an old play written byRobert Green, a dramatist in the days of Queen Elizabeth, it is recounted, that,having been summoned before the king, the friar was induced to show\" some of hisskill before her majesty the queen. So he waved his hand (his wand, says thetext), and \"presently was heard such excellent music, that they all said theyhad never heard the like.\" Then there was heard a still louder music and fourapparitions suddenly presented themselves and danced until they vanished anddisappeared in the air. Then he waved his wand again, and suddenly there wassuch a smell \"as if all the rich perfumes in the whole world had been thereprepared in the best manner that art could set them out.\" Then Roger Baconhaving promised a gentleman to show him his sweetheart, he pulled a hanging inthe king's apartment aside and every one in the room saw \"a kitchen-maid with abasting-ladle in her hand.\" The proud gentleman, although he recognized themaiden who disappeared as suddenly as she had appeared, was enraged at thehumiliating spectacle, and threatened the friar with his revenge. What does themagician do? He simply answers: \"Threaten not, lest I do you more shame; and doyou take heed how you give scholars the lie again!\" As a commentary on this, the modern historian *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu001.htm#fn_91] remarks: \"This may be takenas a sort of exemplification of the class of exhibitions which were probably theresult of a superior knowledge of natural sciences.\" No one ever doubted that itwas the result of precisely such a knowledge, and the hermetists, magicians,astrologers and alchemists never claimed anything else. It certainly was nottheir fault that the ignorant masses, under the influence of an unscrupulous andfanatical clergy, should have attributed all such works to the agency of thedevil. In view of the atrocious tortures provided by the Inquisition for allsuspected of either black or white magic, it is not strange that thesephilosophers neither boasted nor even acknowledged the fact of such anintercourse. On the contrary, their own writings prove that they held that magicis \"no more than the application of natural active causes to passive things orsubjects; by means thereof, many tremendously surprising but yet natural effectsare produced.\" The phenomena of the mystic odors and music, exhibited by Roger Bacon, have beenoften observed in our own time. To say nothing of our personal experience, weare informed by English correspondents of the Theosophical Society that theyhave heard strains of the most ravishing music, coming from no visibleinstrument, and inhaled a succession of delightful odors produced, as theybelieved, by spirit-agency. One correspondent tells us that so powerful was oneof these familiar odors--that of sandal-wood--that the house would beimpregnated with it for weeks after the seance. The medium in this case was amember of a private family, and the experiments were all made within thedomestic circle. Another describes what he calls a \"musical rap.\" The potenciesthat are now capable of producing these phenomena must have existed and beenequally efficacious in the days of Roger Bacon. As to the apparitions, itsuffices to say that they are evoked now in spiritualistic circles, andguaranteed by scientists, and their evocation by Roger Bacon is thus made moreprobable than ever. Baptista Porta, in his treatise on Natural Magic, enumerates a whole catalogueof secret formulae for producing extraordinary effects by employing the occultpowers of nature. Although the \"magicians\" believed as firmly as ourspiritualists in a world of invisible spirits, none of them claimed to producehis effects under their control or through their sole help. They knew too wellhow difficult it is to keep away the elementary creatures when they have oncefound the door wide open. Even the magic of the ancient Chaldeans was but aprofound knowledge of the powers of simples and minerals. It was only when thetheurgist desired divine help in spiritual and earthly matters that he soughtdirect communication through religious rites, with pure spiritual beings. Withthem, even, those spirits who remain invisible and communicate with mortalsthrough their awakened inner senses, as in clairvoyance, clairaudience andtrance, could only be evoked subjectively and as a result of purity of life andprayer. But all physical phenomena were produced simply by applying a knowledgeof natural forces, although certainly not by the method of legerdemain,practiced in our days by conjurers. Men possessed of such knowledge and exercising such powers patiently toiled forsomething better than the vain glory of a passing fame. Seeking it not, theybecame immortal, as do all who labor for the good of the race, forgetful of meanself. Illuminated with the light of eternal truth, these rich-poor alchemistsfixed their attention upon the things that lie beyond the common ken,recognizing nothing inscrutable but the First Cause, and finding no questionunsolvable. To dare, to know, to will, and REMAIN SILENT, was their constantrule; to be beneficent, unselfish, and unpretending, were, with them,spontaneous impulses. Disdaining the rewards of petty traffic, spurning wealth,luxury, pomp, and worldly power, they aspired to knowledge as the mostsatisfying of all acquisitions. They esteemed poverty, hunger, toil, and theevil report of men, as none too great a price to pay for its achievement. They,who might have lain on downy, velvet-covered beds, suffered themselves to die inhospitals and by the wayside, rather than debase their souls and allow theprofane cupidity of those who tempted them to triumph over their sacred vows.The lives of Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa, and Philalethes are too well knownto repeat the old, sad story. If spiritualists are anxious to keep strictly dogmatic in their notions of the\"spirit-world,\" they must not set scientists to investigate their phenomena inthe true experimental spirit. The attempt would most surely result in a partialre-discovery of the magic of old--that of Moses and Paracelsus. Under thedeceptive beauty of some of their apparitions, they might find some day thesylphs and fair Undines of the Rosicrucians playing in the currents of psychicand odic force. Already Mr. Crookes, who fully credits the being, feels that under the fair skinof Katie, covering a simulacrum of heart borrowed partially from the medium andthe circle, there is no soul! And the learned authors of The Unseen Universe,abandoning their \"electro-biological\" theory, begin to perceive in the universalether the possibility that it is a photographic album of EN-SOPH--the Boundless. We are far from believing that all the spirits that communicate at circles areof the classes called \"Elemental,\" and \"Elementary.\" Many--especially amongthose who control the medium subjectively to speak, write, and otherwise act invarious ways--are human, disembodied spirits. Whether the majority of suchspirits are good or bad, largely depends on the private morality of the medium,much on the circle present, and a great deal on the intensity and object oftheir purpose. If this object is merely to gratify curiosity and to pass thetime, it is useless to expect anything serious. But, in any case, human spiritscan never materialize themselves in propria persona. These can never appear tothe investigator clothed with warm, solid flesh, sweating hands and faces, andgrossly-material bodies. The most they can do is to project their aetherealreflection on the atmospheric waves, and if the touch of their hands andclothing can become upon rare occasions objective to the senses of a livingmortal, it will be felt as a passing breeze gently sweeping over the touchedspot, not as a human hand or material body. It is useless to plead that the\"materialized spirits\" that have exhibited themselves with beating hearts andloud voices (with or without a trumpet) are human spirits. The voices--if suchsound can be termed a voice at all--of a spiritual apparition once heard canhardly be forgotten. That of a pure spirit is like the tremulous murmur of anÆolian harp echoed from a distance; the voice of a suffering, hence impure, ifnot utterly bad spirit, may be assimilated to a human voice issuing from anempty barrel. This is not our philosophy, but that of the numberless generations of theurgistsand magicians, and based upon their practical experience. The testimony ofantiquity is positive on this subject: Δαιμονιοιν φοναι αναρθροι εισι. . . . *The voices of spirits are not articulated. The spirit-voice consists of a seriesof sounds which conveys the impression of a column of compressed air ascendingfrom beneath upward, and spreading around the living interlocutor. The manyeye-witnesses who testified in the case of Elizabeth Eslinger, namely: ** thedeputy-governor of the prison of Weinsberg, Mayer, Eckhart, Theurer, and Knorr(sworn evidence), Duttenhofer, and Kapff, the mathematician, testified that theysaw the apparition like a pillar of clouds. For the space of eleven weeks,Doctor Kerner and his sons, several Lutheran ministers, the advocate Fraas, theengraver Duttenhofer, two physicians, Siefer and Sicherer, the judge Heyd, andthe Baron von Hugel, with many others, followed this manifestation daily. Duringthe time it lasted, the prisoner Elizabeth prayed with a loud voiceuninterruptedly; therefore, as the \"spirit\" was talking at the same time, itcould be no ventriloquism; and that voice, they say, \"had nothing human in it;no one could imitate its sounds.\" Further on we will give abundant proofs from ancient authors concerning thisneglected truism. We will now only again assert that no spirit claimed by thespiritualists to be human was ever proved to be such on sufficient testimony.The influence of the disembodied ones can be felt, and communicated subjectivelyby them to sensitives. They can produce objective manifestations, but theycannot produce themselves otherwise than as described above. They can controlthe body of a medium, and express their desires and ideas in various modes wellknown to spiritualists; but not materialize what is matterless and purelyspiritual--their divine essence. Thus every so-called \"materialization\"--whengenuine--is either produced (perhaps) by the will of that spirit whom the\"appearance\" is claimed to be but can only personate at best, or by theelementary goblins themselves, which are generally too stupid to deserve thehonor of being called devils. Upon rare occasions the spirits are able to subdueand control these soulless beings, which are ever ready to assume pompous namesif left to themselves, in such a way that the mischievous spirit \"of the air,\"shaped in the real image of the human spirit, will be moved by the latter like amarionette, and unable to either act or utter other words than those imposed onhim by the \"immortal soul.\" But this requires many conditions generally unknownto the circles of even spiritualists most in the habit of regularly attendingseances. Not every one can attract human spirits who likes. One of the mostpowerful attractions of our departed ones is their strong affection for thosewhom they have left on earth. It draws them irresistibly, by degrees, into thecurrent of the Astral Light vibrating between the person sympathetic to them andthe Universal Soul. Another very important condition is harmony, and themagnetic purity of the persons present. If this philosophy is wrong, if all the \"materialized\" forms emerging indarkened rooms from still darker cabinets, are spirits of men who once livedupon this earth, why such a difference between them and the ghosts that appearunexpectedly--ex abrupto--without either cabinet or medium? Who ever heard ofthe apparitions, unrestful \"souls,\" hovering about the spots where they weremurdered, or coming back for some other mysterious reasons of their own, with\"warm hands\" feeling like living flesh, and but that they are known to be deadand buried, not distinguishable from living mortals? We have well-attested factsof such apparitions making themselves suddenly visible, but never, until thebeginning of the era of the \"materializations,\" did we see anything like them.In the Medium and Day Break, of September 8, 1876, we read a letter from \"a ladytravelling on the continent,\" narrating a circumstance that happened in ahaunted house. She says: \". . . A strange sound proceeded from a darkened cornerof the library . . . on looking up she perceived a cloud or column of luminousvapor; . . . . the earth-bound spirit was hovering about the spot renderedaccursed by his evil deed. . . .\" As this spirit was doubtless a genuineelementary apparition, which made itself visible of its own free will--in short,an umbra--it was, as every respectable shadow should be, visible but impalpable,or if palpable at all, communicating to the feeling of touch the sensation of amass of water suddenly clasped in the hand, or of condensed but cold steam. Itwas luminous and vapory; for aught we can tell it might have been the realpersonal umbra of the \"spirit,\" persecuted, and earth-bound, either by its ownremorse and crimes or those of another person or spirit. The mysteries ofafter-death are many, and modern \"materializations\" only make them cheap andridiculous in the eyes of the indifferent. To these assertions may be opposed a fact well known among spiritualists: Thewriter has publicly certified to having seen such materialized forms. We havemost assuredly done so, and are ready to repeat the testimony. We haverecognized such figures as the visible representations of acquaintances,friends, and even relatives. We have, in company with many other spectators,heard them pronounce words in languages unfamiliar not only to the medium and toevery one else in the room, except ourselves, but, in some cases, to almost ifnot quite every medium in America and Europe, for they were the tongues ofEastern tribes and peoples. At the time, these instances were justly regarded asconclusive proofs of the genuine mediumship of the uneducated Vermont farmer whosat in the \"cabinet.\" But, nevertheless, these figures were not the forms of thepersons they appeared to be. They were simply their portrait statues,constructed, animated and operated by the elementaries. If we have notpreviously elucidated this point, it was because the spiritualistic public wasnot then ready to even listen to the fundamental proposition that there areelemental and elementary spirits. Since that time this subject has been broachedand more or less widely discussed. There is less hazard now in attempting tolaunch upon the restless sea of criticism the hoary philosophy of the ancientsages, for there has been some preparation of the public mind to consider itwith impartiality and deliberation. Two years of agitation have effected amarked change for the better. Pausanias writes that four hundred years after the battle of Marathon, therewere still heard in the place where it was fought, the neighing of horses andthe shouts of shadowy soldiers. Supposing that the spectres of the slaughteredsoldiers were their genuine spirits, they looked like \"shadows,\" notmaterialized men. Who, then, or what, produced the neighing of horses? Equine\"spirits\"? And if it be pronounced untrue that horses have spirits--whichassuredly no one among zoologists, physiologists or psychologists, or evenspiritualists, can either prove or disprove--then must we take it for grantedthat it was the \"immortal souls\" of men which produced the neighing at Marathonto make the historical battle scene more vivid and dramatic? The phantoms ofdogs, cats, and various other animals have been repeatedly seen, and theworld-wide testimony is as trustworthy upon this point as that with respect tohuman apparitions. Who or what personates, if we are allowed such an expression,the ghosts of departed animals? Is it, again, human spirits? As the matter nowstands, there is no side issue; we have either to admit that animals havesurviving spirits and souls as well as ourselves, or hold with Porphyry thatthere are in the invisible world a kind of tricky and malicious demons,intermediary beings between living men and \"gods,\" spirits that delight inappearing under every imaginable shape, beginning with the human form, andending with those of multifarious animals. * Before venturing to decide the question whether the spectral animal forms sofrequently seen and attested are the returning spirits of dead beasts, we mustcarefully consider their reported behavior. Do these spectres act according tothe habits and display the same instincts, as the animals during life? Do thespectral beasts of prey lie in wait for victims, and timid animals flee beforethe presence of man; or do the latter show a malevolence and disposition toannoy, quite foreign to their natures? Many victims of theseobsessions--notably, the afflicted persons of Salem and other historicalwitchcrafts--testify to having seen dogs, cats, pigs, and other animals,entering their rooms, biting them, trampling upon their sleeping bodies, andtalking to them; often inciting them to suicide and other crimes. In thewell-attested case of Elizabeth Eslinger, mentioned by Dr. Kerner, theapparition of the ancient priest of Wimmenthal * was accompanied by a largeblack dog, which he called his father, and which dog in the presence of numerouswitnesses jumped on all the beds of the prisoners. At another time the priestappeared with a lamb, and sometimes with two lambs. Most of those accused atSalem were charged by the seeresses with consulting and plotting mischief withyellow birds, which would sit on their shoulder or on the beams overhead. ** Andunless we discredit the testimony of thousands of witnesses, in all parts of theworld, and in all ages, and allow a monopoly of seership to modern mediums,spectre-animals do appear and manifest all the worst traits of depraved humannature, without themselves being human. What, then, can they be but elementals? Descartes was one of the few who believed and dared say that to occult medicinewe shall owe discoveries \"destined to extend the domain of philosophy\"; andBrierre de Boismont not only shared in these hopes but openly avowed hissympathy with \"supernaturalism,\" which he considered the universal \"grandcreed.\" \". . . We think with Guizot,\" he says, \"that the existence of society isbound up in it. It is in vain that modern reason, which, notwithstanding itspositivism, cannot explain the intimate cause of any phenomena, rejects thesupernatural; it is universal, and at the root of all hearts. The most elevatedminds are frequently its most ardent disciples.\" *** Christopher Columbus discovered America, and Americus Vespucius reaped the gloryand usurped his dues. Theophrastus Paracelsus rediscovered the occult propertiesof the magnet--\"the bone of Horus\" which, twelve centuries before his time, hadplayed such an important part in the theurgic mysteries--and he very naturallybecame the founder of the school of magnetism and of mediaeval magico-theurgy.But Mesmer, who lived nearly three hundred years after him, and as a disciple ofhis school brought the magnetic wonders before the public, reaped the glory thatwas due to the fire-philosopher, while the great master died in a hospital! So goes the world: new discoveries, evolving from old sciences; new men--thesame old nature! [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES43:* W.

Still, even those that are produced by occult forcesof nature, such as happen through a few genuine mediums, and are consciouslyemployed by the so-called \"jugglers\" of India and Egypt, deserve a careful andserious investigation by science; especially now that a number of respectedauthorities have testified that in many cases the hypothesis of fraud does nothold. No doubt, there are professed \"conjurors\" who can perform cleverer tricksthan all the American and English \"John Kings\" together. Robert Houdinunquestionably could, but this did not prevent his laughing outright in the faceof the academicians, when they desired him to assert in the newspapers, that hecould make a table move, or rap answers to questions, without contact of hands,unless the table was a prepared one. * The fact alone, that a now notoriousLondon juggler refused to accept a challenge for £1,000 offered him by Mr.Algernon Joy, ** to produce such manifestations as are usually obtained throughmediums, unless he was left unbound and free from the hands of a committee,negatives his expose of the occult phenomena. Clever as he may be, we defy andchallenge him to reproduce, under the same conditions, the \"tricks\" exhibitedeven by a common Indian juggler. For instance, the spot to be chosen by theinvestigators at the moment of the performance, and the juggler to know nothingof the choice; the experiment to be made in broad daylight, without the leastpreparations for it; without any confederate but a boy absolutely naked, and thejuggler to be in a condition of semi-nudity. After that, we should select out ofa variety three tricks, the most common among such public jugglers, and thatwere recently exhibited to some gentlemen belonging to the suite of the Princeof Wales: 1. To transform a rupee--firmly clasped in the hand of a skeptic--intoa living cobra, the bite of which would prove fatal, as an examination of itsfangs would show. 2. To cause a seed chosen at random by the spectators, andplanted in the first semblance of a flower-pot, furnished by the same skeptics,to grow, mature, and bear fruit in less than a quarter of an hour. 3. To stretchhimself on three swords, stuck perpendicularly in the ground at their hilts, thesharp points upward; after that, to have removed first one of the swords, thenthe other, and, after an interval of a few seconds, the last one, the jugglerremaining, finally, lying on nothing--on the air, miraculously suspended atabout one yard from the ground. When any prestidigitateur, to begin with Houdinand end with the last trickster who has secured gratuitous advertisement byattacking spiritualism, does the same, then--but only then--we will trainourselves to believe that mankind has been evolved out of the hind-toe of Mr.Huxley's Eocene Orohippus. We assert again, in full confidence, that there does not exist a professionalwizard, either of the North, South or West, who can compete with anythingapproaching success, with these untutored, naked sons of the East. These requireno Egyptian Hall for their performances, nor any preparations or rehearsals; butare ever ready, at a moment's notice, to evoke to their help the hidden powersof nature, which, for European prestidigitateurs as well as for scientists, area closed book. Verily, as Elihu puts it, \"great men are not always wise; neitherdo the aged understand judgment.\" * To repeat the remark of the English divine,Dr. Henry More, we may well say: \". . . indeed, if there were any modesty leftin mankind, the histories of the Bible might abundantly assure men of theexistence of angels and spirits.\" The same eminent man adds, \"I look upon it asa special piece of Providence that . . . fresh examples of apparitions mayawaken our benumbed and lethargic minds into an assurance that there are otherintelligent beings besides those that are clothed in heavy earth or clay . . .for this evidence, showing that there are bad spirits, will necessarily open adoor to the belief that there are good ones, and lastly, that there is a God.\"The instance above given carries a moral with it, not only to scientists, buttheologians. Men who have made their mark in the pulpit and in professors'chairs, are continually showing the lay public that they really know so littleof psychology, as to take up with any plausible schemer who comes their way, andso make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of the thoughtful student. Publicopinion upon this subject has been manufactured by jugglers and self-styledsavants, unworthy of respectful consideration. The development of psychological science has been retarded far more by theridicule of this class of pretenders, than by the inherent difficulties of itsstudy. The empty laugh of the scientific nursling or of the fools of fashion,has done more to keep man ignorant of his imperial psychical powers, than theobscurities, the obstacles and the dangers that cluster about the subject. Thisis especially the case with spiritualistic phenomena. That their investigationhas been so largely confined to incapables, is due to the fact that men ofscience, who might and would have studied them, have been frightened off by theboasted exposures, the paltry jokes, and the impertinent clamor of those who arenot worthy to tie their shoes. There are moral cowards even in universitychairs. The inherent vitality of modern spiritualism is proven in its survivalof the neglect of the scientific body, and of the obstreperous boasting of itspretended exposers. If we begin with the contemptuous sneers of the patriarchsof science, such as Faraday and Brewster, and end with the professional (?)exposes of the successful mimicker of the phenomena, ----, of London, we willnot find them furnishing one single, well-established argument against theoccurrence of spiritual manifestations. \"My theory is,\" says this individual, inhis recent soi-disant \"expose,\" \"that Mr. Williams dressed up and personifiedJohn King and Peter. Nobody can prove that it wasn't so.\" Thus it appears that,notwithstanding the bold tone of assertion, it is but a theory after all, andspiritualists might well retort upon the exposer, and demand that he shouldprove that it is so. But the most inveterate, uncompromising enemies of Spiritualism are a class veryfortunately composed of but few members, who, nevertheless, declaim the louderand assert their views with a clamorousness worthy of a better cause. These arethe pretenders to science of young America--a mongrel class ofpseudo-philosophers, mentioned at the opening of this chapter, with sometimes nobetter right to be regarded as scholars than the possession of an electricalmachine, or the delivery of a puerile lecture on insanity and mediomania. Suchmen are--if you believe them--profound thinkers and physiologists; there is noneof your metaphysical nonsense about them; they are Positivists--the mentalsucklings of Auguste Comte, whose bosoms swell at the thought of pluckingdeluded humanity from the dark abyss of superstition, and rebuilding the cosmoson improved principles. Irascible psychophobists, no more cutting insult can beoffered them than to suggest that they may be endowed with immortal spirits. Tohear them, one would fancy that there can be no other souls in men and womenthan \"scientific\" or \"unscientific souls\"; whatever that kind of soul may be. * Some thirty or forty years ago, in France, Auguste Comte--a pupil of the EcolePolytechnique, who had remained for years at that establishment as a repetiteurof Transcendant Analysis and Rationalistic Mechanics--awoke one fine morningwith the very irrational idea of becoming a prophet. In America, prophets can bemet with at every street-corner; in Europe, they are as rare as black swans. ButFrance is the land of novelties. Auguste Comte became a prophet; and soinfectious is fashion, sometimes, that even in sober England he was considered,for a certain time, the Newton of the nineteenth century. The epidemic extended, and for the time being, it spread like wildfire overGermany, England, and America. It found adepts in France, but the excitement didnot last long with these. The prophet needed money: the disciples were unwillingto furnish it. The fever of admiration for a religion without a God cooled offas quickly as it had come on; of all the enthusiastic apostles of the prophet,there remained but one worthy of any attention. It was the famous philologistLittre, a member of the French Institute, and a would-be member of the ImperialAcademy of Sciences, but whom the archbishop of Orleans maliciously preventedfrom becoming one of the \"Immortals.\" * The philosopher-mathematician--the high-priest of the \"religion of thefuture\"--taught his doctrine as do all his brother-prophets of our modern days.He deified \"woman,\" and furnished her with an altar; but the goddess had to payfor its use. The rationalists had laughed at the mental aberration of Fourier;they had laughed at the St. Simonists; and their scorn for Spiritualism knew nobounds. The same rationalists and materialists were caught, like so manyempty-headed sparrows, by the bird-lime of the new prophet's rhetoric. A longingfor some kind of divinity, a craving for the \"unknown,\" is a feeling congenitalin man; hence the worst atheists seem not to be exempt from it. Deceived by theoutward brilliancy of this ignus fatuus, the disciples followed it until theyfound themselves floundering in a bottomless morass. Covering themselves with the mask of a pretended erudition, the Positivists ofthis country have organized themselves into clubs and committees with the designof uprooting Spiritualism, while pretending to impartially investigate it. Too timid to openly challenge the churches and the Christian doctrine, theyendeavor to sap that upon which all religion is based--man's faith in God andhis own immortality. Their policy is to ridicule that which affords an unusualbasis for such a faith--phenomenal Spiritualism. Attacking it at its weakest side, they make the most of its lack of an inductivemethod, and of the exaggerations that are to be found in the transcendentaldoctrines of its propagandists. Taking advantage of its unpopularity, anddisplaying a courage as furious and out of place as that of the errant knight ofLa Mancha, they claim recognition as philanthropists and benefactors who wouldcrush out a monstrous superstition. Let us see in what degree Comte's boasted religion of the future is superior toSpiritualism, and how much less likely its advocates are to need the refuge ofthose lunatic asylums which they officiously recommend for the mediums whom theyhave been so solicitous about. Before beginning, let us call attention to thefact that three-fourths of the disgraceful features exhibited in modernSpiritualism are directly traceable to the materialistic adventurers pretendingto be spiritualists. Comte has fulsomely depicted the \"artificially-fecundated\"woman of the future. She is but elder sister to the Cyprian ideal of thefree-lovers. The immunity against the future offered by the teachings of hismoonstruck disciples, has inoculated some pseudo-spiritualists to such an extentas to lead them to form communistic associations. None, however, have provedlong-lived. Their leading feature being generally a materialistic animalism,gilded over with a thin leaf of Dutch-metal philosophy and tricked out with acombination of hard Greek names, the community could not prove anything elsethan a failure. Plato, in the fifth book of the Republic, suggests a method for improving thehuman race by the elimination of the unhealthy or deformed individuals, and bycoupling the better specimens of both sexes. It was not to be expected that the\"genius of our century,\" even were he a prophet, would squeeze out of his brainanything entirely new. Comte was a mathematician. Cleverly combining several old utopias, he coloredthe whole, and, improving on Plato's idea, materialized it, and presented theworld with the greatest monstrosity that ever emanated from a human mind! We beg the reader to keep in view, that we do not attack Comte as a philosopher,but as a professed reformer. In the irremediable darkness of his political,philosophical and religious views, we often meet with isolated observations andremarks in which profound logic and judiciousness of thought rival thebrilliancy of their interpretation. But then, these dazzle you like flashes oflightning on a gloomy night, to leave you, the next moment, more in the darkthan ever. If condensed and repunctuated, his several works might produce, onthe whole, a volume of very original aphorisms, giving a very clear and reallyclever definition of most of our social evils; but it would be vain to seek,either through the tedious circumlocution of the six volumes of his Cours dePhilosophie Positive, or in that parody on priesthood, in the form of adialogue--The Catechism of the Religion of Positivism--any idea suggestive ofeven provisional remedies for such evils. His disciples suggest that the sublimedoctrines of their prophet were not intended for the vulgar. Comparing thedogmas preached by Positivism with their practical exemplifications by itsapostles, we must confess the possibility of some very achromatic doctrine beingat the bottom of it. While the \"high-priest\" preaches that \"woman must cease tobe the female of the man\"; * while the theory of the positivist legislators onmarriage and the family, chiefly consists in making the woman the \"merecompanion of man by ridding her of every maternal function\"; ** and while theyare preparing against the future a substitute for that function by applying \"tothe chaste woman\" \"a latent force,\" *** some of its lay priests openly preachpolygamy, and others affirm that their doctrines are the quintessence ofspiritual philosophy. In the opinion of the Romish clergy, who labor under a chronic nightmare of thedevil, Comte offers his \"woman of the future\" to the possession of the\"incubi.\" **** In the opinion of more prosaic persons, the Divinity ofPositivism, must henceforth be regarded as a biped broodmare. Even Littre, madeprudent restrictions while accepting the apostleship of this marvellousreligion. This is what he wrote in 1859: \"M. Comte not only thought that he found the principles, traced the outlines,and furnished the method, but that he had deduced the consequences andconstructed the social and religious edifice of the future. It is in this seconddivision that we make our reservations, declaring, at the same time, that weaccept as an inheritance, the whole of the first.\" ***** Further, he says: \"M. Comte, in a grand work entitled the System of the PositivePhilosophy, established the basis of a philosophy [?] which must finallysupplant every theology and the whole of metaphysics. Such a work necessarilycontains a direct application to the government of societies; as it has nothingarbitrary in it [?] and as we find therein a real science [?], my adhesion tothe principles involves my adhesion to the essential consequences.\" M. Littre has shown himself in the light of a true son of his prophet. Indeedthe whole system of Comte appears to us to have been built on a play of words.When they say \"Positivism,\" read Nihilism; when you hear the word chastity, knowthat it means impudicity; and so on. Being a religion based on a theory of negation, its adherents can hardly carryit out practically without saying white when meaning black! \"Positive Philosophy,\" continues Littre, \"does not accept atheism, for theatheist is not a really-emancipated mind, but is, in his own way, a theologianstill; he gives his explanation about the essence of things; he knows how theybegan! . . . Atheism is Pantheism; this system is quite theological yet, andthus belongs to the ancient party.\" * It really would be losing time to quote any more of these paradoxicaldissertations. Comte attained to the apotheosis of absurdity and inconsistencywhen, after inventing his philosophy, he named it a \"Religion.\" And, as isusually the case, the disciples have surpassed the reformer--in absurdity.Supposititious philosophers, who shine in the American academies of Comte, likea lampyris noctiluca beside a planet, leave us in no doubt as to their belief,and contrast \"that system of thought and life\" elaborated by the French apostlewith the \"idiocy\" of Spiritualism; of course to the advantage of the former. \"Todestroy, you must replace\"; exclaims the author of the Catechism of the Religionof Positivism, quoting Cassaudiere, by the way, without crediting him with thethought; and his disciples proceed to show by what sort of a loathsome systemthey are anxious to replace Christianity, Spiritualism, and even Science. \"Positivism,\" perorates one of them, \"is an integral doctrine. It rejectscompletely all forms of theological and metaphysical belief; all forms ofsupernaturalism, and thus--Spiritualism. The true positive spirit consists insubstituting the study of the invariable laws of phenomena for that of theirso-called causes, whether proximate or primary. On this ground it equallyrejects atheism; for the atheist is at bottom a theologian,\" he adds,plagiarizing sentences from Littre's works: \"the atheist does not reject theproblems of theology, only the solution of these, and so he is illogical. WePositivists reject the problem in our turn on the ground that it is utterlyinaccessible to the intellect, and we would only waste our strength in a vainsearch for first and final causes. As you see, Positivism gives a completeexplanation [?] of the world, of man, his duty and destiny . . . . \"! ** Very brilliant this; and now, by way of contrast, we will quote what a reallygreat scientist, Professor Hare, thinks of this system. \"Comte's positivephilosophy,\" he says, \"after all, is merely negative. It is admitted by Comte,that he knows nothing of the sources and causes of nature's laws; that theirorigination is so perfectly inscrutable as to make it idle to take up time inany scrutiny for that purpose. . . . Of course his doctrine makes him avowedly athorough ignoramus, as to the causes of laws, or the means by which they areestablished, and can have no basis but the negative argument above stated, inobjecting to the facts ascertained in relation to the spiritual creation. Thus,while allowing the atheist his material dominion, Spiritualism will erect withinand above the same space a dominion of an importance as much greater as eternityis to the average duration of human life, and as the boundless regions of thefixed stars are to the habitable area of this globe.\" * In short, Positivism proposes to itself to destroy Theology, Metaphysics,Spiritualism, Atheism, Materialism, Pantheism, and Science, and it must finallyend in destroying itself. De Mirville thinks that according to Positivism,\"order will begin to reign in the human mind only on the day when psychologywill become a sort of cerebral physics, and history a kind of social physics.\"The modern Mohammed first disburdens man and woman of God and their own soul,and then unwittingly disembowels his own doctrine with the too sharp sword ofmetaphysics, which all the time he thought he was avoiding, thus letting outevery vestige of philosophy. In 1864, M. Paul Janet, a member of the Institute, pronounced a discourse uponPositivism, in which occur the following remarkable words: \"There are some minds which were brought up and fed on exact and positivesciences, but which feel nevertheless, a sort of instinctive impulse forphilosophy. They can satisfy this instinct but with elements that they havealready on hand. Ignorant in psychological sciences, having studied only therudiments of metaphysics, they nevertheless are determined to fight these samemetaphysics as well as psychology, of which they know as little as of the other.After this is done, they will imagine themselves to have founded a PositiveScience, while the truth is that they have only built up a new mutilated andincomplete metaphysical theory. They arrogate to themselves the authority andinfallibility properly belonging alone to the true sciences, those which arebased on experience and calculations; but they lack such an authority, for theirideas, defective as they may be, nevertheless belong to the same class as thosewhich they attack. Hence the weakness of their situation, the final ruin oftheir ideas, which are soon scattered to the four winds.\" ** The Positivists of America have joined hands in their untiring efforts tooverthrow Spiritualism. To show their impartiality, though, they propound suchnovel queries as follows: \" . . . how much rationality is there in the dogmas ofthe Immaculate Conception, the Trinity and Transubstantiation, if submitted tothe tests of physiology, mathematics, and chemistry?\" and they \"undertake tosay, that the vagaries of Spiritualism do not surpass in absurdity theseeminently respectable beliefs.\" Very well. But there is neither theologicalabsurdity nor spiritualistic delusion that can match in depravity and imbecilitythat positivist notion of \"artificial fecundation.\" Denying to themselves allthought on primal and final causes, they apply their insane theories to theconstruction of an impossible woman for the worship of future generations; theliving, immortal companion of man they would replace with the Indian femalefetich of the Obeah, the wooden idol that is stuffed every day with serpents'eggs, to be hatched by the heat of the sun! And now, if we are permitted to ask in the name of common-sense, why shouldChristian mystics be taxed with credulity or the spiritualists be consigned toBedlam, when a religion embodying such revolting absurdity finds disciples evenamong Academicians?--when such insane rhapsodies as the following can be utteredby the mouth of Comte and admired by his followers: \"My eyes are dazzled;--theyopen each day more and more to the increasing coincidence between the socialadvent of the feminine mystery, and the mental decadence of the eucharisticalsacrament. Already the Virgin has dethroned God in the minds of SouthernCatholics! Positivism realizes the Utopia of the mediaeval ages, by representingall the members of the great family as the issue of a virgin mother without ahusband. . . .\" And again, after giving the modus operandi: \"The development ofthe new process would soon cause to spring up a caste without heredity, betteradapted than vulgar procreation to the recruitment of spiritual chiefs, or eventemporal ones, whose authority would then rest upon an origin truly superior,which would not shrink from an investigation.\" * To this we might inquire with propriety, whether there has ever been found inthe \"vagaries of Spiritualism,\" or the mysteries of Christianity, anything morepreposterous than this ideal \"coming race.\" If the tendency of materialism isnot grossly belied by the behavior of some of its advocates, those who publiclypreach polygamy, we fancy that whether or not there will ever be a sacerdotalstirp so begotten, we shall see no end of progeny,--the offspring of \"motherswithout husbands.\" How natural that a philosophy which could engender such a caste of didacticincubi, should express through the pen of one of its most garrulous essayists,the following sentiments: \"This is a sad, a very sad age, * full of dead anddying faiths; full of idle prayers sent out in vain search for the departinggods. But oh! it is a glorious age, full of the golden light which streams fromthe ascending sun of science! What shall we do for those who are shipwrecked infaith, bankrupt in intellect, but . . . who seek comfort in the mirage ofspiritualism, the delusions of transcendentalism, or the will o' the wisp ofmesmerism? . . .\" The ignis fatuus, now so favorite an image with many dwarf philosophers, haditself to struggle for recognition. It is not so long since the now familiarphenomenon was stoutly denied by a correspondent of the London Times, whoseassertions carried weight, till the work of Dr. Phipson, supported by thetestimony of Beccaria, Humboldt, and other naturalists, set the question atrest. ** The Positivists should choose some happier expression, and follow thediscoveries of science at the same time. As to mesmerism, it has been adopted inmany parts of Germany, and is publicly used with undeniable success in more thanone hospital; its occult properties have been proved and are believed in byphysicians, whose eminence, learning, and merited fame, the self-complacentlecturer on mediums and insanity cannot well hope to equal. We have to add but a few more words before we drop this unpleasant subject. Wehave found Positivists particularly happy in the delusion that the greatestscientists of Europe were Comtists. How far their claims may be just, as regardsother savants, we do not know, but Huxley, whom all Europe considers one of hergreatest scientists, most decidedly declines that honor, and Dr. Maudsley, ofLondon, follows suit. In a lecture delivered by the former gentleman in 1868, inEdinburgh, on The Physical Basis of Life, he even appears to be very muchshocked at the liberty taken by the Archbishop of York, in identifying him withComte's philosophy. \"So far as I am concerned,\" says Mr. Huxley, \"the mostreverend prelate might dialectically hew Mr. Comte in pieces, as a modern Agag,and I would not attempt to stay his hand. In so far as my study of whatspecially characterizes the positive philosophy has led me, I find, therein,little or nothing of any scientific value, and a great deal which is asthoroughly antagonistic to the very essence of science as anything inultramontane Catholicism. In fact, Comte's philosophy in practice might becompendiously described as Catholicism minus Christianity.\" Further, Huxley evenbecomes wrathful, and falls to accusing Scotchmen of ingratitude for havingallowed the Bishop to mistake Comte for the founder of a philosophy whichbelonged by right to Hume. \"It was enough,\" exclaims the professor, \"to makeDavid Hume turn in his grave, that here, almost within earshot of his house, aninterested audience should have listened, without a murmur, whilst his mostcharacteristic doctrines were attributed to a French writer of fifty years laterdate, in whose dreary and verbose pages we miss alike the vigor of thought andthe clearness of style. . . .\" * Poor Comte! It appears that the highest representatives of his philosophy arenow reduced, at least in this country, to \"one physicist, one physician who hasmade a specialty of nervous diseases, and one lawyer.\" A very witty criticnicknamed this desperate trio, \"an anomalistic triad, which, amid its arduouslabors, finds no time to acquaint itself with the principles and laws of theirlanguage.\" ** To close the question, the Positivists neglect no means to overthrowSpiritualism in favor of their religion. Their high priests are made to blowtheir trumpets untiringly; and though the walls of no modern Jericho are everlikely to tumble down in dust before their blast, still they neglect no means toattain the desired object. Their paradoxes are unique, and their accusationsagainst spiritualists irresistible in logic. In a recent lecture, for instance,it was remarked that: \"The exclusive exercise of religious instinct isproductive of sexual immorality. Priests, monks, nuns, saints, media, ecstatics,and devotees are famous for their impurities.\" *** We are happy to remark that, while Positivism loudly proclaims itself areligion, Spiritualism has never pretended to be anything more than a science, agrowing philosophy, or rather a research in hidden and as yet unexplained forcesin nature. The objectiveness of its various phenomena has been demonstrated bymore than one genuine representative of science, and as ineffectually denied byher \"monkeys.\" Finally, it may be remarked of our Positivists who deal so unceremoniously withevery psychological phenomenon, that they are like Samuel Butler's rhetorician,who \". . . . could not opeHis mouth, but out there flew a trope.\"We would there were no occasion to extend the critic's glance beyond the circleof triflers and pedants who improperly wear the title of men of science. But itis also undeniable that the treatment of new subjects by those whose rank ishigh in the scientific world but too often passes unchallenged, when it isamenable to censure. The cautiousness bred of a fixed habit of experimentalresearch, the tentative advance from opinion to opinion, the weight accorded torecognized authorities--all foster a conservatism of thought which naturallyruns into dogmatism. The price of scientific progress is too commonly themartyrdom or ostracism of the innovator. The reformer of the laboratory must, soto speak, carry the citadel of custom and prejudice at the point of the bayonet.It is rare that even a postern-door is left ajar by a friendly hand. The noisyprotests and impertinent criticisms of the little people of the antechamber ofscience, he can afford to let pass unnoticed; the hostility of the other classis a real peril that the innovator must face and overcome. Knowledge doesincrease apace, but the great body of scientists are not entitled to the credit.In every instance they have done their best to shipwreck the new discovery,together with the discoverer. The palm is to him who has won it by individualcourage, intuitiveness, and persistency. Few are the forces in nature which,when first announced, were not laughed at, and then set aside as absurd andunscientific. Humbling the pride of those who had not discovered anything, thejust claims of those who have been denied a hearing until negation was no longerprudent, and then--alas for poor, selfish humanity! these very discoverers toooften became the opponents and oppressors, in their turn, of still more recentexplorers in the domain of natural law! So, step by step, mankind move aroundtheir circumscribed circle of knowledge, science constantly correcting itsmistakes, and readjusting on the following day the erroneous theories of thepreceding one. This has been the case, not merely with questions pertaining topsychology, such as mesmerism, in its dual sense of a physical and spiritualphenomenon, but even with such discoveries as directly related to exactsciences, and have been easy to demonstrate. What can we do? Shall we recall the disagreeable past? Shall we point tomediaeval scholars conniving with the clergy to deny the Heliocentric theory,for fear of hurting an ecclesiastical dogma? Must we recall how learnedconchologists once denied that the fossil shells, found scattered over the faceof the earth, were ever inhabited by living animals at all? How the naturalistsof the eighteenth century declared these but mere fac-similes of animals? Andhow these naturalists fought and quarrelled and battled and called each othernames, over these venerable mummies of the ancient ages for nearly a century,until Buffon settled the question by proving to the negators that they weremistaken? Surely an oyster-shell is anything but transcendental, and ought to bequite a palpable subject for any exact study; and if the scientists could notagree on that, we can hardly expect them to believe at all that evanescentforms,--of hands, faces, and whole bodies sometimes--appear at the seances ofspiritual mediums, when the latter are honest. There exists a certain work which might afford very profitable reading for theleisure hours of skeptical men of science. It is a book published by Flourens,the Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy, called Histoire des Recherches deBuffon. The author shows in it how the great naturalist combated and finallyconquered the advocates of the fac-simile theory; and how they still went ondenying everything under the sun, until at times the learned body fell into afury, an epidemic of negation. It denied Franklin and his refined electricity;laughed at Fulton and his concentrated steam; voted the engineer Perdormet astrait-jacket for his offer to build railroads; stared Harvey out ofcountenance; and proclaimed Bernard de Palissy \"as stupid as one of his ownpots!\" In his oft-quoted work, Conflict between Religion and Science, Professor Drapershows a decided propensity to kick the beam of the scales of justice, and layall such impediments to the progress of science at the door of the clergy alone.With all respect and admiration due to this eloquent writer and scientist, wemust protest and give every one his just due. Many of the above-enumerateddiscoveries are mentioned by the author of the Conflict. In every case hedenounces the bitter resistance on the part of the clergy, and keeps silent onthe like opposition invariably experienced by every new discoverer at the handsof science. His claim on behalf of science that \"knowledge is power\" isundoubtedly just. But abuse of power, whether it proceeds from excess of wisdomor ignorance is alike obnoxious in its effects. Besides, the clergy are silencednow. Their protests would at this day be scarcely noticed in the world ofscience. But while theology is kept in the background, the scientists haveseized the sceptre of despotism with both hands, and they use it, like thecherubim and flaming sword of Eden, to keep the people away from the tree ofimmortal life and within this world of perishable matter. The editor of the London Spiritualist, in answer to Dr. Gully's criticism of Mr.Tyndall's fire-mist theory, remarks that if the entire body of spiritualists arenot roasting alive at Smithfield in the present century, it is to science alonethat we are indebted for this crowning mercy. Well, let us admit that thescientists are indirectly public benefactors in this case, to the extent thatthe burning of erudite scholars is no longer fashionable. But is it unfair toask whether the disposition manifested toward the spiritualistic doctrine byFaraday, Tyndall, Huxley, Agassiz, and others, does not warrant the suspicionthat if these learned gentlemen and their following had the unlimited power onceheld by the Inquisition, spiritualists would not have reason to feel as easy asthey do now? Even supposing that they should not roast believers in theexistence of a spirit-world--it being unlawful to cremate people alive--wouldthey not send every spiritualist they could to Bedlam? Do they not call us\"incurable monomaniacs,\" \"hallucinated fools,\" \"fetich-worshippers,\" and likecharacteristic names? Really, we cannot see what should have stimulated to suchextent the gratitude of the editor of the London Spiritualist, for thebenevolent tutelage of the men of science. We believe that the recentLankester-Donkin-Slade prosecution in London ought at last to open the eyes ofhopeful spiritualists, and show them that stubborn materialism is often morestupidly bigoted than religious fanaticism itself. One of the cleverest productions of Professor Tyndall's pen is his caustic essayupon Martineau and Materialism. At the same time it is one which in future yearsthe author will doubtless be only too ready to trim of certain unpardonablegrossnesses of expression. For the moment, however, we will not deal with these,but consider what he has to say of the phenomenon of consciousness. He quotesthis question from Mr. Martineau: \"A man can say 'I feel, I think, I love'; buthow does consciousness infuse itself into the problem?\" And thus answers: \"Thepassage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts ofconsciousness is unthinkable. Granted that a definite thought and a molecularaction in the brain occur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectualorgan nor apparently any rudiments of the organ, which would enable us to passby a process of reasoning from one to the other. They appear together, but we donot know why. Were our minds and senses so expanded, strengthened andilluminated, as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain;were we capable of following all their motions, all their groupings, all theirelectric discharges, if such there be; and were we intimately acquainted withthe corresponding states of thought and feeling, we should be as far as everfrom the solution of the problem, 'How are these physical processes connectedwith the facts of consciousness?' The chasm between the two classes of phenomenawould still remain intellectually impassable.\" * This chasm, as impassable to Professor Tyndall as the fire-mist where thescientist is confronted with his unknowable cause, is a barrier only to menwithout spiritual intuitions. Professor Buchanan's Outlines of Lectures on theNeurological System of Anthropology, a work written so far back as 1854,contains suggestions that, if the sciolists would only heed them, would show howa bridge can be thrown across this dreadful abyss. It is one of the bins inwhich the thought-seed of future harvests is stored up by a frugal present. Butthe edifice of materialism is based entirely upon that gross sub-structure--thereason. When they have stretched its capabilities to their utmost limits, itsteachers can at best only disclose to us an universe of molecules animated by anoccult impulse. What better diagnosis of the ailment of our scientists could beasked than can be derived from Professor Tyndall's analysis of the mental stateof the Ultramontane clergy by a very slight change of names. For \"spiritualguides\" read \"scientists,\" for \"prescientific past\" substitute \"materialisticpresent,\" say \"spirit\" for \"science,\" and in the following paragraph we have alife portrait of the modern man of science drawn by the hand of a master: \" . . . Their spiritual guides live so exclusively in the prescientific past,that even the really strong intellects among them are reduced to atrophy asregards scientific truth. Eyes they have and see not; ears they have and hearnot; for both eyes and ears are taken possession of by the sights and sounds ofanother age. In relation to science, the Ultramontane brain, through lack ofexercise, is virtually the undeveloped brain of the child. And thus it is thatas children in scientific knowledge, but as potent wielders of spiritual poweramong the ignorant, they countenance and enforce practices sufficient to bringthe blush of shame to the cheeks of the more intelligent among themselves.\" *The Occultist holds this mirror up to science that it may see how it looksitself. Since history recorded the first laws established by man, there never was yet apeople, whose code did not hang the issues of the life and death of its citizensupon the testimony of two or three credible witnesses. \"At the mouth of twowitnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put todeath,\" ** says Moses, the first legislator we meet in ancient history. \"Thelaws which put to death a man on the deposition of one witness are fatal tofreedom\"--says Montesquieu. \"Reason claims there should be two witnesses.\" *** Thus the value of evidence has been tacitly agreed upon and accepted in everycountry. But the scientists will not accept the evidence of the million againstone. In vain do hundreds of thousands of men testify to facts. Oculos habent etnon vident! They are determined to remain blind and deaf. Thirty years ofpractical demonstrations and the testimony of some millions of believers inAmerica and Europe are certainly entitled to some degree of respect andattention. Especially so, when the verdict of twelve spiritualists, influencedby the evidence testified to by any two others, is competent to send even ascientist to swing on the gallows for a crime, perhaps committed under theimpulse supplied by a commotion among the cerebral molecules unrestrained by aconsciousness of future moral RETRIBUTION. Toward science as a whole, as a divine goal, the whole civilized world ought tolook with respect and veneration; for science alone can enable man to understandthe Deity by the true appreciation of his works. \"Science is the understandingof truth or facts,\" says Webster; \"it is an investigation of truth for its ownsake and a pursuit of pure knowledge.\" If the definition be correct, then themajority of our modern scholars have proved false to their goddess. \"Truth forits own sake!\" And where should the keys to every truth in nature be searchedfor, unless in the hitherto unexplored mystery of psychology? Alas! that inquestioning nature so many men of science should daintily sort over her factsand choose only such for study as best bolster their prejudices. Psychology has no worse enemies than the medical school denominatedallopathists. It is in vain to remind them that of the so-called exact sciences,medicine, confessedly, least deserves the name. Although of all branches ofmedical knowledge, psychology ought more than any other to be studied byphysicians, since without its help their practice degenerates into mereguess-work and chance-intuitions, they almost wholly neglect it. The leastdissent from their promulgated doctrines is resented as a heresy, and though anunpopular and unrecognized curative method should be shown to save thousands,they seem, as a body, disposed to cling to accepted hypotheses andprescriptions, and decry both innovator and innovation until they get themint-stamp of regularity. Thousands of unlucky patients may die meanwhile, butso long as professional honor is vindicated, this is a matter of secondaryimportance. Theoretically the most benignant, at the same time no other school of scienceexhibits so many instances of petty prejudice, materialism, atheism, andmalicious stubbornness as medicine. The predilections and patronage of theleading physicians are scarcely ever measured by the usefulness of a discovery.Bleeding, by leeching, cupping, and the lancet, had its epidemic of popularity,but at last fell into merited disgrace; water, now freely given to feveredpatients, was once denied them, warm baths were superseded by cold water, andfor a while hydropathy was a mania. Peruvian bark--which a modern defender ofbiblical authority seriously endeavors to identify with the paradisiacal \"Treeof Life,\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu002.htm#fn_122] and which wasbrought to Spain in 1632--was neglected for years. The Church, for once, showedmore discrimination than science. At the request of Cardinal de Lugo, InnocentX. gave it the prestige of his powerful name. In an old book entitled Demonologia, the author cites many instances ofimportant remedies which being neglected at first afterward rose into noticethrough mere accident. He also shows that most of the new discoveries inmedicine have turned out to be no more than \"the revival and readoption of veryancient practices.\" During the last century, the root of the male fern was soldand widely advertised as a secret nostrum by a Madame Nouffleur, a female quack,for the effective cure of the tapeworm. The secret was bought by Louis XV. for alarge sum of money; after which the physicians discovered that it wasrecommended and administered in that disease by Galen. The famous powder of theDuke of Portland for the gout, was the diacentaureon of Caelius Aurelianus.Later it was ascertained that it had been used by the earliest medical writers,who had found it in the writings of the old Greek philosophers. So with the eaumedicinale of Dr. Husson, whose name it bears. This famous remedy for the goutwas recognized under its new mask to be the Colchicum autumnale, or meadowsaffron, which is identical with a plant called Hermodactylus, whose merits as acertain antidote to gout were recognized and defended by Oribasius, a greatphysician of the fourth century, and Ætius Amidenus, another eminent physicianof Alexandria (fifth century). Subsequently it was abandoned and fell intodisfavor only because it was too old to be considered good by the members of themedical faculties that flourished toward the end of the last century! Even the great Magendie, the wise physiologist, was not above discovering thatwhich had already been discovered and found good by the oldest physicians. Hisproposed remedy against consumption, namely, the use of prussic acid, may befound in the works of Linnaeus, Amenitates Academicae, vol. iv., in which heshows distilled laurel water to have been used with great profit in pulmonaryconsumption. Pliny also assures us that the extract of almonds and cherry-pitshad cured the most obstinate coughs. As the author of Demonologia well remarks,it may be asserted with perfect safety that \"all the various secret preparationsof opium which have been lauded as the discovery of modern times, may berecognized in the works of ancient authors,\" who see themselves so discreditedin our days. It is admitted on all hands that from time immemorial the distant East was theland of knowledge. Not even in Egypt were botany and mineralogy so extensivelystudied as by the savants of archaic Middle Asia. Sprengel, unjust andprejudiced as he shows himself in everything else, confesses this much in hisHistoire de la Medicine. And yet, notwithstanding this, whenever the subject ofmagic is discussed, that of India has rarely suggested itself to any one, for ofits general practice in that country less is known than among any other ancientpeople. With the Hindus it was and is more esoteric, if possible, than it waseven among the Egyptian priests. So sacred was it deemed that its existence wasonly half admitted, and it was only practiced in public emergencies. It was morethan a religious matter, for it was considered divine. The Egyptian hierophants,notwithstanding the practice of a stern and pure morality, could not be comparedfor one moment with the ascetical Gymnosophists, either in holiness of life ormiraculous powers developed in them by the supernatural adjuration of everythingearthly. By those who knew them well they were held in still greater reverencethan the magians of Chaldea. Denying themselves the simplest comforts of life,they dwelt in woods, and led the life of the most secluded hermits, * whiletheir Egyptian brothers at least congregated together. Notwithstanding the slurthrown by history on all who practiced magic and divination, it has proclaimedthem as possessing the greatest secrets in medical knowledge and unsurpassedskill in its practice. Numerous are the volumes preserved in Hindu convents, inwhich are recorded the proofs of their learning. To attempt to say whether theseGymnosophists were the real founders of magic in India, or whether they onlypracticed what had passed to them as an inheritance from the earliestRishis **--the seven primeval sages--would be regarded as a mere speculation byexact scholars. \"The care which they took in educating youth, in familiarizingit with generous and virtuous sentiments, did them peculiar honor, and theirmaxims and discourses, as recorded by historians, prove that they were expert inmatters of philosophy, metaphysics, astronomy, morality, and religion,\" says amodern writer. They preserved their dignity under the sway of the most powerfulprinces, whom they would not condescend to visit, or to trouble for theslightest favor. If the latter desired the advice or the prayers of the holymen, they were either obliged to go themselves, or to send messengers. To thesemen no secret power of either plant or mineral was unknown. They had fathomednature to its depths, while psychology and physiology were to them open books,and the result was that science or machagiotia that is now termed, sosuperciliously, magic. While the miracles recorded in the Bible have become accepted facts with theChristians, to disbelieve which is regarded as infidelity, the narratives ofwonders and prodigies found in the Atharva-Veda, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu002.htm#fn_125] either provoke theircontempt or are viewed as evidences of diabolism. And yet, in more than onerespect, and notwithstanding the unwillingness of certain Sanscrit scholars, wecan show the identity between the two. Moreover, as the Vedas have now beenproved by scholars to antedate the Jewish Bible by many ages, the inference isan easy one that if one of them has borrowed from the other, the Hindu sacredbooks are not to be charged with plagiarism. First of all, their cosmogony shows how erroneous has been the opinion prevalentamong the civilized nations that Brahma was ever considered by the Hindus theirchief or Supreme God. Brahma is a secondary deity, and like Jehovah is \"a moverof the waters.\" He is the creating god, and has in his allegoricalrepresentations four heads, answering to the four cardinal points. He is thedemiurgos, the architect of the world. \"In the primordiate state of thecreation,\" says Polier's Mythologie des Indous, \"the rudimental universe,submerged in water, reposed in the bosom of the Eternal. Sprang from this chaosand darkness, Brahma, the architect of the world, poised on a lotus-leaf floated(moved?) upon the waters, unable to discern anything but water and darkness.\"This is as identical as possible with the Egyptian cosmogony, which shows in itsopening sentences Athtor ** or Mother Night (which represents illimitabledarkness) as the primeval element which covered the infinite abyss, animated bywater and the universal spirit of the Eternal, dwelling alone in Chaos. As inthe Jewish Scriptures, the history of the creation opens with the spirit of Godand his creative emanation--another Deity. *** Perceiving such a dismal state ofthings, Brahma soliloquizes in consternation: \"Who am I? Whence came I?\" Then hehears a voice: \"Direct your prayer to Bhagavant--the Eternal, known, also, asParabrahma.\" Brahma, rising from his natatory position, seats himself upon thelotus in an attitude of contemplation, and reflects upon the Eternal, who,pleased with this evidence of piety, disperses the primeval darkness and openshis understanding. \"After this Brahma issues from the universal egg--(infinitechaos) as light, for his understanding is now opened, and he sets himself towork; he moves on the eternal waters, with the spirit of God within himself; inhis capacity of mover of the waters he is Narayana.\" The lotus, the sacred flower of the Egyptians, as well as the Hindus, is thesymbol of Horus as it is that of Brahma. No temples in Thibet or Nepaul arefound without it; and the meaning of this symbol is extremely suggestive. Thesprig of lilies placed in the hand of the archangel, who offers them to theVirgin Mary, in the pictures of the \"Annunciation,\" have in their esotericsymbolism precisely the same meaning. We refer the reader to Sir WilliamJones. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu002.htm#fn_128] With the Hindus,the lotus is the emblem of the productive power of nature, through the agency offire and water (spirit and matter). \"Eternal!\" says a verse in the BhagavadGita, \"I see Brahma the creator enthroned in thee above the lotus!\" and Sir W.Jones shows that the seeds of the lotus contain--even before theygerminate--perfectly-formed leaves, the miniature shapes of what one day, asperfected plants, they will become; or, as the author of The Heathen Religion,has it--\"nature thus giving us a specimen of the preformation of itsproductions\"; adding further that \"the seed of all phoenogamous plants bearingproper flowers, contain an embryo plantlet ready formed.\" ** With the Buddhists, it has the same signification. Maha-Maya, or Maha-Deva, themother of Gautama Buddha, had the birth of her son announced to her by Bhodisat(the spirit of Buddha), who appeared beside her couch with a lotus in his hand.Thus, also, Osiris and Horus are represented by the Egyptians constantly inassociation with the lotus-flower. These facts all go to show the identical parentage of this idea in the threereligious systems, Hindu, Egyptian and Judaico-Christian. Wherever the mysticwater-lily (lotus) is employed, it signifies the emanation of the objective fromthe concealed, or subjective--the eternal thought of the ever-invisible Deitypassing from the abstract into the concrete or visible form. For as soon asdarkness was dispersed and \"there was light,\" Brahma's understanding was opened,and he saw in the ideal world (which had hitherto lain eternally concealed inthe Divine thought) the archetypal forms of all the infinite future things thatwould be called into existence, and hence become visible. At this first stage ofaction, Brahma had not yet become the architect, the builder of the universe,for he had, like the architect, to first acquaint himself with the plan, andrealize the ideal forms which were buried in the bosom of the Eternal One, asthe future lotus-leaves are concealed within the seed of that plant. And it isin this idea that we must look for the origin and explanation of the verse inthe Jewish cosmogony, which reads: \"And God said, Let the earth bring forth . .. the fruit-tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself.\" In allthe primitive religions, the \"Son of the Father\" is the creative God--i.e., Histhought made visible; and before the Christian era, from the Trimurti of theHindus down to the three kabalistic heads of the Jewish-explained scriptures,the triune godhead of each nation was fully defined and substantiated in itsallegories. In the Christian creed we see but the artificial engrafting of a newbranch upon the old trunk; and the adoption by the Greek and Roman churches ofthe lily-symbol held by the archangel at the moment of the Annunciation, shows athought of precisely the same metaphysical significance. The lotus is the product of fire (heat) and water, hence the dual symbol ofspirit and matter. The God Brahma is the second person of the Trinity, as areJehovah (Adam-Kadmon) and Osiris, or rather Pimander, or the Power of theThought Divine, of Hermes; for it is Pimander who represents the root of all theEgyptian Sun-gods. The Eternal is the Spirit of Fire, which stirs up andfructifies and develops into a concrete form everything that is born of water orthe primordial earth, evolved out of Brahma; but the universe is itself Brahma,and he is the universe. This is the philosophy of Spinoza, which he derived fromthat of Pythagoras; and it is the same for which Bruno died a martyr. How muchChristian theology has gone astray from its point of departure, is demonstratedin this historical fact. Bruno was slaughtered for the exegesis of a symbol thatwas adopted by the earliest Christians, and expounded by the apostles! The sprigof water-lilies of Bhodisat, and later of Gabriel, typifying fire and water, orthe idea of creation and generation, is worked into the earliest dogma of thebaptismal sacrament. Bruno's and Spinoza's doctrines are nearly identical, though the words of thelatter are more veiled, and far more cautiously chosen than those to be found inthe theories of the author of the Causa Principio et Uno, or the InfinitoUniverso e Mondi. Both Bruno, who confesses that the source of his informationwas Pythagoras, and Spinoza, who, without acknowledging it as frankly, allowshis philosophy to betray the secret, view the First Cause from the samestand-point. With them, God is an Entity totally per se, an Infinite Spirit, andthe only Being utterly free and independent of either effects or other causes;who, through that same Will which produced all things and gave the first impulseto every cosmic law, perpetually keeps in existence and order everything in theuniverse. As well as the Hindu Swabhavikas, erroneously called Atheists, whoassume that all things, men as well as gods and spirits, were born fromSwabhava, or their own nature, * both Spinoza and Bruno were led to theconclusion that God is to be sought for within nature and not without. For,creation being proportional to the power of the Creator, the universe as well asits Creator must be infinite and eternal, one form emanating from its ownessence, and creating in its turn another. The modern commentators affirm thatBruno, \"unsustained by the hope of another and better world, still surrenderedhis life rather than his convictions\"; thereby allowing it to be inferred thatGiordano Bruno had no belief in the continued existence of man after death.Professor Draper asserts most positively that Bruno did not believe in theimmortality of the soul. Speaking of the countless victims of the religiousintolerance of the Popish Church, he remarks: \"The passage from this life to thenext, though through a hard trial, was the passage from a transient trouble toeternal happiness. . . . On his way through the dark valley, the martyr believedthat there was an invisible hand that would lead him. . . . For Bruno there wasno such support. The philosophical opinions, for the sake of which hesurrendered his life, could give him no consolation.\" * But Professor Draper seems to have a very superficial knowledge of the truebelief of the philosophers. We can leave Spinoza out of the question, and evenallow him to remain in the eyes of his critics an utter atheist and materialist;for the cautious reserve which he placed upon himself in his writings makes itextremely difficult for one who does not read him between the lines, and is notthoroughly acquainted with the hidden meaning of the Pythagorean metaphysics, toascertain what his real sentiments were. But as for Giordano Bruno, if headhered to the doctrines of Pythagoras he must have believed in another life,hence, he could not have been an atheist whose philosophy offered him no such\"consolation.\" His accusation and subsequent confession, as given by ProfessorDomenico Berti, in his Life of Bruno, and compiled from original documentsrecently published, proved beyond doubt what were his real philosophy, creed anddoctrines. In common with the Alexandrian Platonists, and the later Kabalists,he held that Jesus was a magician in the sense given to this appellation byPorphyry and Cicero, who call it the divina sapientia (divine knowledge), and byPhilo Judaes, who described the Magi as the most wonderful inquirers into thehidden mysteries of nature, not in the degrading sense given to the word magicin our century. In his noble conception, the Magi were holy men, who, settingthemselves apart from everything else on this earth, contemplated the divinevirtues and understood the divine nature of the gods and spirits, the moreclearly; and so, initiated others into the same mysteries, which consist in oneholding an uninterrupted intercourse with these invisible beings during life.But we will show Bruno's inmost philosophical convictions better by quotingfragments from the accusation and his own confession. The charges in the denunciation of Mocenigo, his accuser, are expressed in thefollowing terms: \"I, Zuane Mocenigo, son of the most illustrious Ser Marcantonio, denounce toyour very reverend fathership, by constraint of my conscience and by order of myconfessor, that I have heard say by Giordano Bruno, several times when hediscoursed with me in my house, that it is great blasphemy in Catholics to saythat the bread transubstantiates itself into flesh; that he is opposed to theMass; that no religion pleases him; that Christ was a wretch (un tristo), andthat if he did wicked works to seduce the people he might well predict that Heought to be impaled; that there is no distinction of persons in God, and that itwould be imperfection in God; that the world is eternal, and that there areinfinite worlds, and that God makes them continually, because, he says, Hedesires all He can; that Christ did apparent miracles and was a magician, and sowere the apostles, and that he had a mind to do as much and more than they did;that Christ showed an unwillingness to die, and shunned death all He could; thatthere is no punishment of sin, and that souls created by the operation of naturepass from one animal to another, and that as the brute animals are born ofcorruption, so also are men when after dissolution they come to be born again.\" Perfidious as they are, the above words plainly indicate the belief of Bruno inthe Pythagorean metempsychosis, which, misunderstood as it is, still shows abelief in the survival of man in one shape or another. Further, the accusersays: \"He has shown indications of wishing to make himself the author of a new sect,under the name of 'New Philosophy.' He has said that the Virgin could not havebrought forth, and that our Catholic faith is all full of blasphemies againstthe majesty of God; that the monks ought to be deprived of the right ofdisputation and their revenues, because they pollute the world; that they areall asses, and that our opinions are doctrines of asses; that we have no proofthat our faith has merit with God, and that not to do to others what we wouldnot have done to ourselves suffices for a good life, and that he laughs at allother sins, and wonders how God can endure so many heresies in Catholics. Hesays that he means to apply himself to the art of divination, and make all theworld run after him; that St. Thomas and all the Doctors knew nothing to comparewith him, and that he could ask questions of all the first theologians of theworld that they could not answer.\" To this, the accused philosopher answered by the following profession of faith,which is that of every disciple of the ancient masters: \"I hold, in brief, to an infinite universe, that is, an effect of infinitedivine power, because I esteemed it a thing unworthy of divine goodness andpower, that being able to produce besides this world another and infiniteothers, it should produce a finite world. Thus I have declared that there areinfinite particular worlds similar to this of the earth, which, with Pythagoras,I understand to be a star similar in nature with the moon, the other planets,and the other stars, which are infinite; and that all those bodies are worlds,and without number, which thus constitute the infinite universality in aninfinite space, and this is called the infinite universe, in which areinnumerable worlds, so that there is a double kind of infinite greatness in theuniverse, and of a multitude of worlds. Indirectly, this may be understood to berepugnant to the truth according to the true faith. \"Moreover, I place in this universe a universal Providence, by virtue of whicheverything lives, vegetates and moves, and stands in its perfection, and Iunderstand it in two ways; one, in the mode in which the whole soul is presentin the whole and every part of the body, and this I call nature, the shadow andfootprint of divinity; the other, the ineffable mode in which God, by essence,presence, and power, is in all and above all, not as part, not as soul, but inmode inexplicable. \"Moreover, I understand all the attributes in divinity to be one and the samething. Together with the theologians and great philosophers, I apprehend threeattributes, power, wisdom, and goodness, or, rather, mind, intellect, love, withwhich things have first, being, through the mind; next, ordered and distinctbeing, through the intellect; and third, concord and symmetry, through love.Thus I understand being in all and over all, as there is nothing withoutparticipation in being, and there is no being without essence, just as nothingis beautiful without beauty being present; thus nothing can be free from thedivine presence, and thus by way of reason, and not by way of substantial truth,do I understand distinction in divinity. \"Assuming then the world caused and produced, I understand that, according toall its being, it is dependent upon the first cause, so that it did not rejectthe name of creation, which I understand that Aristotle also has expressed,saying, 'God is that upon whom the world and all nature depends,' so thataccording to the explanation of St. Thomas, whether it be eternal or in time, itis, according to all its being, dependent on the first cause, and nothing in itis independent. \"Next, in regard to what belongs to the true faith, not speakingphilosophically, to come to individuality about the divine persons, the wisdomand the son of the mind, called by philosophers intellect, and by theologiansthe word, which ought to be believed to have taken on human flesh. But I,abiding in the phrases of philosophy, have not understood it, but have doubtedand held it with inconstant faith, not that I remember to have shown marks of itin writing nor in speech, except indirectly from other things, something of itmay be gathered as by way of ingenuity and profession in regard to what may beproved by reason and concluded from natural light. Thus, in regard to the HolySpirit in a third person, I have not been able to comprehend, as ought to bebelieved, but, according to the Pythagoric manner, in conformity to the mannershown by Solomon, I have understood it as the soul of the universe, or adjoinedto the universe according to the saying of the wisdom of Solomon: 'The spirit ofGod filled all the earth, and that which contains all things,' all whichconforms equally to the Pythagoric doctrine explained by Virgil in the text ofthe Æneid: Principio coelum ac terras camposque liquentes,Lucentemque globum Lunae, Titaniaque astraSpiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artusMens agitat molem;and the lines following. \"From this spirit, then, which is called the life of the universe, I understand,in my philosophy, proceeds life and soul to everything which has life and soul,which, moreover, I understand to be immortal, as also to bodies, which, as totheir substance, are all immortal, there being no other death than division andcongregation, which doctrine seems expressed in Ecclesiastes, where it is saidthat 'there is nothing new under the sun; that which is is that which was.' \" Furthermore, Bruno confesses his inability to comprehend the doctrine of threepersons in the godhead, and his doubts of the incarnation of God in Jesus, butfirmly pronounces his belief in the miracles of Christ. How could he, being aPythagorean philosopher, discredit them? If, under the merciless constraint ofthe Inquisition, he, like Galileo, subsequently recanted, and threw himself uponthe clemency of his ecclesiastical persecutors, we must remember that he spokelike a man standing between the rack and the fagot, and human nature cannotalways be heroic when the corporeal frame is debilitated by torture andimprisonment. But for the opportune appearance of Berti's authoritative work, we would havecontinued to revere Bruno as a martyr, whose bust was deservedly set high in thePantheon of Exact Science, crowned with laurel by the hand of Draper. But now wesee that their hero of an hour is neither atheist, materialist, nor positivist,but simply a Pythagorean who taught the philosophy of Upper Asia, and claimed topossess the powers of the magicians, so despised by Draper's own school! Nothingmore amusing than this contretemps has happened since the supposed statue of St.Peter was discovered by irreverent archaeologists to be nothing else than theJupiter of the Capitol, and Buddha's identity with the Catholic St. Josaphat wassatisfactorily proven. Thus, search where we may through the archives of history, we find that there isno fragment of modern philosophy--whether Newtonian, Cartesian, Huxleyian or anyother--but has been dug from the Oriental mines. Even Positivism and Nihilismfind their prototype in the exoteric portion of Kapila's philosophy, as is wellremarked by Max Muller. It was the inspiration of the Hindu sages thatpenetrated the mysteries of Pragna Paramita (perfect wisdom); their hands thatrocked the cradle of the first ancestor of that feeble but noisy child that wehave christened MODERN SCIENCE.

His battle with desMousseaux, de Mirville and other fanatics who laid the whole of the spiritualphenomena at the door of Satan, was long and fierce. Two volumes of over fifteenhundred pages are the result, proving the effects, denying the cause, andemploying superhuman efforts to invent every other possible explanation thatcould be suggested rather than the true one. The severe rebuke received by the Journal des Debats from M. de Gasparin, wasread by all civilized Europe. * After that gentleman had minutely describednumerous manifestations that he had witnessed himself, this journal veryimpertinently proposed to the authorities in France to send all those who, afterhaving read the fine analysis of the \"spiritual hallucinations\" published byFaraday, should insist on crediting this delusion, to the lunatic asylum forIncurables. \"Take care,\" wrote de Gasparin in answer, \"the representatives ofthe exact sciences are on their way to become . . . the Inquisitors of our days.. . . Facts are stronger than Academies. Rejected, denied, mocked, theynevertheless are facts, and do exist.\" ** The following affirmations of physical phenomena, as witnessed by himself andProfessor Thury, may be found in de Gasparin's voluminous work. \"The experimenters have often seen the legs of the table glued, so to say, tothe floor, and, notwithstanding the excitement of those present, refuse to bemoved from their place. On other occasions they have seen the tables levitatedin quite an energetic way. They heard, with their own ears, loud as well asgentle raps, the former threatening to shatter the table to pieces on account oftheir violence, the latter so soft as to become hardly perceptible. . . . As toLEVITATIONS WITHOUT CONTACT, we found means to produce them easily, and withsuccess. . . . And such levitations do not pertain to isolated results. We havereproduced them over THIRTY times. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu003.htm#fn_134] . . . One day the tablewill turn, and lift its legs successively, its weight being augmented by a manweighing eighty-seven kilogrammes seated on it; another time it will remainmotionless and immovable, notwithstanding that the person placed on it weighsbut sixty. **. . . On one occasion we willed it to turn upside down, and itturned over, with its legs in the air, notwithstanding that our fingers nevertouched it once.\" *** \"It is certain,\" remarks de Mirville, \"that a man who had repeatedly witnessedsuch a phenomenon, could not accept the fine analysis of the Englishphysicist.\" **** Since 1850, des Mousseaux and de Mirville, uncompromising Roman Catholics, havepublished many volumes whose titles are cleverly contrived to attract publicattention. They betray on the part of the authors a very serious alarm, which,moreover, they take no pains to conceal. Were it possible to consider thephenomena spurious, the church of Rome would never have gone so much out of herway to repress them. Both sides having agreed upon the facts, leaving skeptics out of the question,people could divide themselves into but two parties: the believers in the directagency of the devil, and the believers in disembodied and other spirits. Thefact alone, that theology dreaded a great deal more the revelations which mightcome through this mysterious agency than all the threatening \"conflicts\" withScience and the categorical denials of the latter, ought to have opened the eyesof the most skeptical. The church of Rome has never been either credulous orcowardly, as is abundantly proved by the Machiavellism which marks her policy.Moreover, she has never troubled herself much about the clever prestidigitateurswhom she knew to be simply adepts in juggling. Robert Houdin, Comte, Hamiltonand Bosco, slept secure in their beds, while she persecuted such men asParacelsus, Cagliostro, and Mesmer, the Hermetic philosophers and mystics--andeffectually stopped every genuine manifestation of an occult nature by killingthe mediums. Those who are unable to believe in a personal devil and the dogmas of the churchmust nevertheless accord to the clergy enough of shrewdness to prevent thecompromising of her reputation for infallibility by making so much ofmanifestations which, if fraudulent, must inevitably be some day exposed. But the best testimony to the reality of this force was given by Robert Houdinhimself, the king of jugglers, who, upon being called as an expert by theAcademy to witness the wonderful clairvoyant powers and occasional mistakes of atable, said: \"We jugglers never make mistakes, and my second-sight never failedme yet.\" The learned astronomer Babinet was not more fortunate in his selection of Comte,the celebrated ventriloquist, as an expert to testify against the phenomena ofdirect voices and the rappings. Comte, if we may believe the witnesses, laughedin the face of Babinet at the bare suggestion that the raps were produced by\"unconscious ventriloquism!\" The latter theory, worthy twin-sister of\"unconscious cerebration,\" caused many of the most skeptical academicians toblush. Its absurdity was too apparent. \"The problem of the supernatural,\" says de Gasparin, \"such as it was presentedby the middle ages, and as it stands now, is not among the number of those whichwe are permitted to despise; its breadth and grandeur escape the notice of noone. . . . Everything is profoundly serious in it, both the evil and the remedy,the superstitious recrudescency, and the physical fact which is destined toconquer the latter.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu003.htm#fn_138] Further, he pronounces the following decisive opinion, to which he came,conquered by the various manifestations, as he says himself--\"The number offacts which claim their place in the broad daylight of truth, has so muchincreased of late, that of two consequences one is henceforth inevitable: eitherthe domain of natural sciences must consent to expand itself, or the domain ofthe supernatural will become so enlarged as to have no bounds.\" ** Among the multitude of books against spiritualism emanating from Catholic andProtestant sources, none have produced a more appalling effect than the works ofde Mirville and des Mousseaux: La Magie au XIXme Siecle--Moeurs et Pratiques desDemons--Hauts Phenomees de la Magie--Les Mediateurs de la Magie--Des Esprits etde leurs Manifestations, etc. They comprise the most cyclopaedic biography ofthe devil and his imps that has appeared for the private delectation of goodCatholics since the middle ages. According to the authors, he who was \"a liar and murderer from the beginning,\"was also the principal motor of spiritual phenomena. He had been for thousandsof years at the head of pagan theurgy; and it was he, again, who, encouraged bythe increase of heresies, infidelity, and atheism, had reappeared in ourcentury. The French Academy lifted up its voice in a general outcry ofindignation, and M. de Gasparin even took it for a personal insult. \"This is adeclaration of war, a 'levee of shields' \"--wrote he in his voluminous book ofrefutations. \"The work of M. de Mirville is a real manifesto. . . . I would beglad to see in it the expression of a strictly individual opinion, but, intruth, it is impossible. The success of the work, these solemn adhesions, thefaithful reproduction of its theses by the journals and writers of the party,the solidarity established throughout between them and the whole body ofcatholicity . . . everything goes to show a work which is essentially an act,and has the value of a collective labor. As it is, I felt that I had a duty toperform. . . . I felt obliged to pick up the glove. . . . and lift high theProtestant flag against the Ultramontane banner.\" * The medical faculties, as might have been expected, assuming the part of theGreek chorus, echoed the various expostulations against the demonologicalauthors. The Medico-Psychological Annals, edited by Drs. Brierre de Boismont andCerise, published the following: \"Outside these controversies of antagonisticalparties, never in our country did a writer dare to face, with a more aggressiveserenity, . . . the sarcasms, the scorn of what we term common sense; and, as ifto defy and challenge at the same time thundering peals of laughter andshrugging of shoulders, the author strikes an attitude, and placing himself witheffrontery before the members of the Academy . . . addresses to them what hemodestly terms his Memoire on the Devil!\" ** That was a cutting insult to the Academicians, to be sure; but ever since 1850they seem to have been doomed to suffer in their pride more than most of themcan bear. The idea of asking the attention of the forty \"Immortals\" to thepranks of the Devil! They vowed revenge, and, leaguing themselves together,propounded a theory which exceeded in absurdity even de Mirville's demonolatry!Dr. Royer and Jobart de Lamballe--both celebrities in their way--formed analliance and presented to the Institute a German whose cleverness afforded,according to his statement, the key to all the knockings and rappings of bothhemispheres. \"We blush\"--remarks the Marquis de Mirville--\"to say that the wholeof the trick consisted simply in the reiterated displacement of one of themuscular tendons of the legs. Great demonstration of the system in full sittingof the Institute--and on the spot . . . expressions of Academical gratitude forthis interesting communication, and, a few days later, a full assurance given tothe public by a professor of the medical faculty, that, scientists havingpronounced their opinion, the mystery was at last unravelled!\" * But such scientific explanations neither prevented the phenomenon from quietlyfollowing its course, nor the two writers on demonology from proceeding toexpound their strictly orthodox theories. Denying that the Church had anything to do with his books, des Mousseaux gravelygave the Academy, in addition to his Memoire, the following interesting andprofoundly philosophical thoughts on Satan: \"The Devil is the chief pillar of Faith. He is one of the grand personages whoselife is closely allied to that of the church; and without his speech whichissued out so triumphantly from the mouth of the Serpent, his medium, the fallof man could not have taken place. Thus, if it was not for him, the Saviour, theCrucified, the Redeemer, would be but the most ridiculous of supernumeraries,and the Cross an insult to good sense!\" ** This writer, be it remembered, is only the faithful echo of the church, whichanathematizes equally the one who denies God and him who doubts the objectiveexistence of Satan. But the Marquis de Mirville carries this idea of God's partnership with theDevil still further. According to him it is a regular commercial affair, inwhich the senior \"silent partner\" suffers the active business of the firm to betransacted as it may please his junior associate, by whose audacity and industryhe profits. Who could be of any other opinion, upon reading the following? \"At the moment of this spiritual invasion of 1853, so slightingly regarded, wehad dared to pronounce the word of a 'threatening catastrophe.' The world wasnevertheless at peace, but history showing us the same symptoms at alldisastrous epochs, we had a presentiment of the sad effects of a law whichGoerres has formulated thus: [vol. v., p. 356.] 'These mysterious apparitionshave invariably indicated the chastening hand of God on earth.' \" *** These guerilla-skirmishes between the champions of the clergy and thematerialistic Academy of Science, prove abundantly how little the latter hasdone toward uprooting blind fanaticism from the minds of even very educatedpersons. Evidently science has neither completely conquered nor muzzledtheology. She will master her only on that day when she will condescend to seein the spiritual phenomenon something besides mere hallucination andcharlatanry. But how can she do it without investigating it thoroughly? Let ussuppose that before the time when electro-magnetism was publicly acknowledged,the Copenhagen Professor Oersted, its discoverer, had been suffering from anattack of what we call psychophobia, or pneumatophobia. He notices that the wirealong which a voltaic current is passing shows a tendency to turn the magneticneedle from its natural position to one perpendicular to the direction of thecurrent. Suppose, moreover, that the professor had heard much of certainsuperstitious people who used that kind of magnetized needles to converse withunseen intelligences. That they received signals and even held correctconversations with them by means of the tippings of such a needle, and that inconsequence he suddenly felt a scientific horror and disgust for such anignorant belief, and refused, point-blank, to have anything to do with such aneedle. What would have been the result? Electro-magnetism might not have beendiscovered till now, and our experimentalists would have been the principallosers thereby. Babinet, Royer, and Jobert de Lamballe, all three members of the Institute,particularly distinguished themselves in this struggle between skepticism andsupernaturalism, and most assuredly have reaped no laurels. The famousastronomer had imprudently risked himself on the battlefield of the phenomenon.He had explained scientifically the manifestations. But, emboldened by the fondbelief among scientists that the new epidemic could not stand closeinvestigation nor outlive the year, he had the still greater imprudence topublish two articles on them. As M. de Mirville very wittily remarks, if both ofthe articles had but a poor success in the scientific press, they had, on theother hand, none at all in the daily one. M. Babinet began by accepting a priori, the rotation and movements of thefurniture, which fact he declared to be \"hors de doute.\" \"This rotation,\" hesaid, \"being able to manifest itself with a considerable energy, either by avery great speed, or by a strong resistance when it is desired that it shouldstop.\" * Now comes the explanation of the eminent scientist. \"Gently pushed by littleconcordant impulsions of the hands laid upon it, the table begins to oscillatefrom right to left. . . . At the moment when, after more or less delay, anervous trepidation is established in the hands and the little individualimpulsions of all the experimenters have become harmonized, the table is set inmotion.\" ** He finds it very simple, for \"all muscular movements are determined over bodiesby levers of the third order, in which the fulcrum is very near to the pointwhere the force acts. This, consequently, communicates a great speed to themobile parts for the very little distance which the motor force has to run. . .. Some persons are astonished to see a table subjected to the action of severalwell-disposed individuals in a fair way to conquer powerful obstacles, evenbreak its legs, when suddenly stopped; but that is very simple if we considerthe power of the little concordant actions. . . . Once more, the physicalexplanation offers no difficulty.\" * In this dissertation, two results are clearly shown: the reality of thephenomena proved, and the scientific explanation made ridiculous. But M. Babinetcan well afford to be laughed at a little; he knows, as an astronomer, that darkspots are to be found even in the sun. There is one thing, though, that Babinet has always stoutly denied, viz.: thelevitation of furniture without contact. De Mirville catches him proclaimingthat such levitation is impossible: \"simply impossible,\" he says, \"as impossibleas perpetual motion.\" ** Who can take upon himself, after such a declaration, to maintain that the wordimpossible pronounced by science is infallible? But the tables, after having waltzed, oscillated and turned, began tipping andrapping. The raps were sometimes as powerful as pistol-detonations. What ofthis? Listen: \"The witnesses and investigators are ventriloquists!\" De Mirville refers us to the Revue des Deux Mondes, in which is published a veryinteresting dialogue, invented by M. Babinet speaking of himself to himself,like the Chaldean En-Soph of the Kabalists: \"What can we finally say of allthese facts brought under our observation? Are there such raps produced? Yes. Dosuch raps answer questions? Yes. Who produces these sounds? The mediums. By whatmeans? By the ordinary acoustic method of the ventriloquists. But we were givento suppose that these sounds might result from the cracking of the toes andfingers? No; for then they would always proceed from the same point, and such isnot the fact.\" *** \"Now,\" asks de Mirville, \"what are we to believe of the Americans, and theirthousands of mediums who produce the same raps before millions of witnesses?\"\"Ventriloquism, to be sure,\" answers Babinet. \"But how can you explain such animpossibility?\" The easiest thing in the world; listen only: \"All that wasnecessary to produce the first manifestation in the first house in America was,a street-boy knocking at the door of a mystified citizen, perhaps with a leadenball attached to a string, and if Mr. Weekman (the first believer in America)(?) * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu003.htm#fn_150] when he watched forthe third time, heard no shouts of laughter in the street, it is because of theessential difference which exists between a French street-Arab, and an Englishor Trans-Atlantic one, the latter being amply provided with what we call a sadmerriment, \"gaite triste.\" ** Truly says de Mirville in his famous reply to the attacks of de Gasparin,Babinet, and other scientists: \"and thus according to our great physicist, thetables turn very quickly, very energetically, resist likewise, and, as M. deGasparin has proved, they levitate without contact. Said a minister: 'With threewords of a man's handwriting, I take upon myself to have him hung.' With theabove three lines, we take upon ourselves, in our turn, to throw into thegreatest confusion the physicists of all the globe, or rather to revolutionizethe world--if at least, M. de Babinet had taken the precaution of suggesting,like M. de Gasparin, some yet unknown law or force. For this would cover thewhole ground.\" *** But it is in the notes embracing the \"facts and physical theories,\" that we findthe acme of the consistency and logic of Babinet as an expert investigator onthe field of Spiritualism. It would appear, that M. de Mirville in his narrative of the wonders manifestedat the Presbytere de Cideville, **** was much struck by the marvellousness ofsome facts. Though authenticated before the inquest and magistrates, they wereof so miraculous a nature as to force the demonological author himself to shrinkfrom the responsibility of publishing them. These facts were as follows: \"At the precise moment predicted by asorcerer\"--case of revenge--\"a violent clap of thunder was heard above one ofthe chimneys of the presbytery, after which the fluid descended with aformidable noise through that passage, threw down believers as well as skeptics(as to the power of the sorcerer) who were warming themselves by the fire; and,having filled the room with a multitude of fantastic animals, returned to thechimney, and having reascended it, disappeared, after producing the sameterrible noise. \"As,\" adds de Mirville, \"we were already but too rich in facts,we recoiled before this new enormity added to so many others.\" **** But Babinet, who in common with his learned colleagues had made such fun of thetwo writers on demonology, and who was determined, moreover, to prove theabsurdity of all like stories, felt himself obliged to discredit theabove-mentioned fact of the Cideville phenomena, by presenting one still moreincredible. We yield the floor to M. Babinet, himself. The following circumstance which he gave to the Academy of Sciences, on July 5,1852, can be found without further commentary, and merely as an instance of asphere-like lightning, in the \"Œuvres de F. Arago,\" vol. i., p. 52. We offer itverbatim. \"After a strong clap of thunder,\" says M. Babinet, \"but not immediatelyfollowing it, a tailor apprentice, living in the Rue St. Jacques, was justfinishing his dinner, when he saw the paper-screen which shut the fireplace falldown as if pushed out of its place by a moderate gust of wind. Immediately afterthat he perceived a globe of fire, as large as the head of a child, come outquietly and softly from within the grate and slowly move about the room, withouttouching the bricks of the floor. The aspect of this fire-globe was that of ayoung cat, of middle size . . . moving itself without the use of its paws. Thefire-globe was rather brilliant and luminous than hot or inflamed, and thetailor had no sensation of warmth. This globe approached his feet like a youngcat which wishes to play and rub itself against the legs, as is habitual tothese animals; but the apprentice withdrew his feet from it, and moving withgreat caution, avoided contact with the meteor. The latter remained for a fewseconds moving about his legs, the tailor examining it with great curiosity andbending over it. After having tried several excursions in opposite directions,but without leaving the centre of the room, the fire-globe elevated itselfvertically to the level of the man's head, who to avoid its contact with hisface, threw himself backward on his chair. Arrived at about a yard from thefloor the fire-globe slightly lengthened, took an oblique direction toward ahole in the wall over the fireplace, at about the height of a metre above themantelpiece.\" This hole had been made for the purpose of admitting the pipe of astove in winter; but, according to the expression of the tailor, \"the thundercould not see it, for it was papered over like the rest of the wall. Thefire-globe went directly to that hole, unglued the paper without damaging it,and reasscended the chimney . . . when it arrived at the top, which it did veryslowly . . . at least sixty feet above ground . . . it produced a most frightfulexplosion, which partly destroyed the chimney, . . .\" etc. \"It seems,\" remarks de Mirville in his review, \"that we could apply to M.Babinet the following remark made by a very witty woman to Raynal, 'If you arenot a Christian, it is not for lack of faith.' \" * It was not alone believers who wondered at the credulity displayed by M.Babinet, in persisting to call the manifestation a meteor; for Dr. Boudinmentions it very seriously in a work on lightning he was just then publishing.\"If these details are exact,\" says the doctor, \"as they seem to be, since theyare admitted by MM. Babinet and Arago, it appears very difficult for thephenomenon to retain its appellation of sphere-shaped lightning. However, weleave it to others to explain, if they can, the essence of a fire-globe emittingno sensation of heat, having the aspect of a cat, slowly promenading in a room,which finds means to escape by reascending the chimney through an aperture inthe wall covered over with a paper which it unglues without damaging!\" * \"We are of the same opinion,\" adds the marquis, \"as the learned doctor, on thedifficulty of an exact definition, and we do not see why we should not have infuture lightning in the shape of a dog, of a monkey, etc., etc. One shudders atthe bare idea of a whole meteorological menagerie, which, thanks to thunder,might come down to our rooms to promenade themselves at will.\" Says de Gasparin, in his monster volume of refutations: \"In questions oftestimony, certitude must absolutely cease the moment we cross the borders ofthe supernatural.\" ** The line of demarcation not being sufficiently fixed and determined, which ofthe opponents is best fitted to take upon himself the difficult task? Which ofthe two is better entitled to become the public arbiter? Is it the party ofsuperstition, which is supported in its testimony by the evidence of manythousands of people? For nearly two years they crowded the country where weredaily manifested the unprecedented miracles of Cideville, now nearly forgottenamong other countless spiritual phenomena; shall we believe them, or shall webow to science, represented by Babinet, who, on the testimony of one man (thetailor), accepts the manifestation of the fire-globe, or the meteor-cat, andhenceforth claims for it a place among the established facts of naturalphenomena? Mr. Crookes, in his first article in the Quarterly Journal of Science, October1, 1871, mentions de Gasparin and his work Science v. Spiritualism. He remarksthat \"the author finally arrived at the conclusion that all these phenomena areto be accounted for by the action of natural causes, and do not require thesupposition of miracles, nor the intervention of spirits and diabolicalinfluences! Gasparin considers it as a fact fully established by hisexperiments, that the will, in certain states of organism, can act at adistance on inert matter, and most of his work is devoted to ascertaining thelaws and conditions under which this action manifests itself.\" * Precisely; but as the work of de Gasparin called forth numberless Answers,Defenses, and Memoirs, it was then demonstrated by his own work that as he was aProtestant, in point of religious fanaticism, he was as little to be relied uponas des Mousseaux and de Mirville. The former is a profoundly pious Calvinist,while the two latter are fanatical Roman Catholics. Moreover, the very words ofde Gasparin betray the spirit of partisanship:--\"I feel I have a duty toperform. . . . I lift high the Protestant flag against the Ultramontane banner!\"etc. ** In such matters as the nature of the so-called spiritual phenomena, noevidence can be relied upon, except the disinterested testimony of coldunprejudiced witnesses and science. Truth is one, and Legion is the name forreligious sects; every one of which claims to have found the unadulteratedtruth; as \"the Devil is the chief pillar of the (Catholic) Church,\" so allsupernaturalism and miracles ceased, in de Gasparin's opinion, \"withapostleship.\" But Mr. Crookes mentioned another eminent scholar, Thury, of Geneva, professorof natural history, who was a brother-investigator with Gasparin in thephenomena of Valleyres. This professor contradicts point-blank the assertions ofhis colleague. \"The first and most necessary condition,\" says Gasparin, \"is thewill of the experimenter; without the will, one would obtain nothing; you canform the chain (the circle) for twenty-four hours consecutively, withoutobtaining the least movement.\" *** The above proves only that de Gasparin makes no difference between phenomenapurely magnetic, produced by the persevering will of the sitters among whomthere may be not even a single medium, developed or undeveloped, and theso-called spiritual ones. While the first can be produced consciously by nearlyevery person, who has a firm and determined will, the latter overpowers thesensitive very often against his own consent, and always acts independently ofhim. The mesmerizer wills a thing, and if he is powerful enough, that thing isdone. The medium, even if he had an honest purpose to succeed, may get nomanifestations at all; the less he exercises his will, the better the phenomena:the more he feels anxious, the less he is likely to get anything; to mesmerizerequires a positive nature, to be a medium a perfectly passive one. This is theAlphabet of Spiritualism, and no medium is ignorant of it. The opinion of Thury, as we have said, disagrees entirely with Gasparin'stheories of will-power. He states it in so many plain words, in a letter, inanswer to the invitation of the count to modify the last article of his memoire.As the book of Thury is not at hand, we translate the letter as it is found inthe resume of de Mirville's Defense. Thury's article which so shocked hisreligious friend, related to the possibility of the existence and interventionin those manifestations \"of wills other than those of men and animals.\" \"I feel, sir, the justness of your observations in relation to the last pages ofthis memoire: they may provoke a very bad feeling for me on the part ofscientists in general. I regret it the more as my determination seems to affectyou so much; nevertheless, I persist in my resolution, because I think it aduty, to shirk which would be a kind of treason. \"If, against all expectations, there were some truth in Spiritualism, byabstaining from saying on the part of science, as I conceive it to be, that theabsurdity of the belief in the intervention of spirits is not as yetdemonstrated scientifically (for such is the resume, and the thesis of the pastpages of my memoire), by abstaining from saying it to those who, after havingread my work, will feel inclined to experiment with the phenomena, I might riskto entice such persons on a path many issues of which are very equivocal. \"Without leaving the domain of science, as I esteem it, I will pursue my duty tothe end, without any reticence to the profit of my own glory, and, to use yourown words, 'as the great scandal lies there,' I do not wish to assume the shameof it. I, moreover, insist that 'this is as scientific as anything else.' If Iwanted to sustain now the theory of the intervention of disembodied spirits, Iwould have no power for it, for the facts which are made known are notsufficient for the demonstration of such a hypothesis. As it is, and in theposition I have assumed, I feel I am strong against every one. Willingly or not,all the scientists must learn, through experience and their own errors, tosuspend their judgment as to things which they have not sufficiently examined.The lesson you gave them in this direction cannot be lost. \"GENEVA, 21 December, 1854.\" Let us analyze the above letter, and try to discover what the writer thinks, orrather what he does not think of this new force. One thing is certain, at least:Professor Thury, a distinguished physicist and naturalist, admits, and evenscientifically proves that various manifestations take place. Like Mr. Crookes,he does not believe that they are produced by the interference of spirits ordisembodied men who have lived and died on earth; for he says in his letter thatnothing has demonstrated this theory. He certainly believes no more in theCatholic devils or demons, for de Mirville, who quotes this letter as atriumphant proof against de Gasparin's naturalistic theory, once arrived at theabove sentence, hastens to emphasize it by a foot-note, which runs thus: \"AtValleyres--perhaps, but everywhere else!\" * showing himself anxious to conveythe idea that the professor only meant the manifestations of Valleyres, whendenying their being produced by demons. The contradictions, and we are sorry to say, the absurdities in which deGasparin allows himself to be caught, are numerous. While bitterly criticizingthe pretensions of the learned Faradaysiacs, he attributes things which hedeclares magical, to causes perfectly natural. \"If,\" he says, \"we had to dealbut with such phenomena (as witnessed and explained (?) by the great physicist),we might as well hold our tongues; but we have passed beyond, and what good canthey do now, I would ask, these apparatus which demonstrate that an unconsciouspressure explains the whole? It explains all, and the table resists pressure andguidance! It explains all, and a piece of furniture which nobody touches followsthe fingers pointed at it; it levitates (without contact), and it turns itselfupside down!\" ** But for all that, he takes upon himself to explain the phenomena. \"People will be advocating miracles, you say--magic! Every new law appears tothem as a prodigy. Calm yourselves; I take upon myself the task to quiet thosewho are alarmed. In the face of such phenomena, we do not cross at all theboundaries of natural law.\" *** Most assuredly, we do not. But can the scientists assert that they have in theirpossession the keys to such law? M. de Gasparin thinks he has. Let us see. \"I do not risk myself to explain anything; it is no business of mine. (?) Toauthenticate simple facts, and maintain a truth which science desires tosmother, is all I pretend to do. Nevertheless, I cannot resist the temptation topoint out to those who would treat us as so many illuminati or sorcerers, thatthe manifestation in question affords an interpretation which agrees with theordinary laws of science. \"Suppose a fluid, emanating from the experimenters, and chiefly from some ofthem; suppose that the will determined the direction taken by the fluid, and youwill readily understand the rotation and levitation of that one of the legs ofthe table toward which is ejected with every action of the will an excess offluid. Suppose that the glass causes the fluid to escape, and you willunderstand how a tumbler placed on the table can interrupt its rotation, andthat the tumbler, placed on one of its sides, causes the accumulation of thefluid in the opposite side, which, in consequence of that, is lifted!\" If every one of the experimenters were clever mesmerizers, the explanation,minus certain important details, might be acceptable. So much for the power ofhuman will on inanimate matter, according to the learned minister of LouisPhilippe. But how about the intelligence exhibited by the table? Whatexplanation does he give as to answers obtained through the agency of this tableto questions? answers which could not possibly have been the \"reflections of thebrain\" of those present (one of the favorite theories of de Gasparin), for theirown ideas were quite the reverse of the very liberal philosophy given by thiswonderful table? On this he is silent. Anything but spirits, whether human,satanic, or elemental. Thus, the \"simultaneous concentration of thought,\" and the \"accumulation offluid,\" will be found no better than \"the unconscious cerebration\" and \"psychicforce\" of other scientists. We must try again; and we may predict beforehandthat the thousand and one theories of science will prove of no avail until theywill confess that this force, far from being a projection of the accumulatedwills of the circle, is, on the contrary, a force which is abnormal, foreign tothemselves, and supra-intelligent. Professor Thury, who denies the theory of departed human spirits, rejects theChristian devil-doctrine, and shows himself unwilling to pronounce in favor ofCrookes's theory (the 6th), that of the hermetists and ancient theurgists,adopts the one, which, he says in his letter, is \"the most prudent, and makeshim feel strong against every one.\" Moreover, he accepts as little of deGasparin's hypothesis of \"unconscious will-power.\" This is what he says in hiswork: \"As to the announced phenomena, such as the levitation without contact, and thedisplacement of furniture by invisible hands--unable to demonstrate theirimpossibility, a priori, no one has the right to treat as absurd the seriousevidences which affirm their occurrence\" (p. 9). As to the theory proposed by M. de Gasparin, Thury judges it very severely.\"While admitting that in the experiments of Valleyres,\" says de Mirville, \"theseat of the force might have been in the individual--and we say that it wasintrinsic and extrinsic at the same time--and that the will might be generallynecessary (p. 20), he repeats but what he had said in his preface, to wit: 'M.de Gasparin presents us with crude facts, and the explanations following heoffers for what they are worth. Breathe on them, and not many will be foundstanding after this. No, very little, if anything, will remain of hisexplanations. As to facts, they are henceforth demonstrated' \" (p. 10). As Mr. Crookes tells us, Professor Thury refutes \"all these explanations, andconsiders the effects due to a peculiar substance, fluid, or agent, pervading ina manner similar to the luminiferous ether of the scientists, all matter,nervous, organic or inorganic, which he terms psychode. He enters into fulldiscussion as to the properties of this state, or form, or matter, and proposesthe term ectenic force . . . for the power exerted when the mind acts at adistance through the influence of the psychode.\" * Mr. Crookes remarks further, that \"Professor Thury's ectenic force, and his own'psychic force' are evidently equivalent terms.\" We certainly could very easily demonstrate that the two forces are identical,moreover, the astral or sidereal light as explained by the alchemists andEliphas Levi, in his Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie; and that, under the nameof AKASA, or life-principle, this all-pervading force was known to thegymnosophists, Hindu magicians, and adepts of all countries, thousands of yearsago; and, that it is still known to them, and used at present by the Thibetanlamas, fakirs, thaumaturgists of all nationalities, and even by many of theHindu \"jugglers.\" In many cases of trance, artificially induced by mesmerization, it is also quitepossible, even quite probable, that it is the \"spirit\" of the subject which actsunder the guidance of the operator's will. But, if the medium remains conscious,and psycho-physical phenomena occur which indicate a directing intelligence,then, unless it be conceded that he is a \"magician,\" and can project his double,physical exhaustion can signify nothing more than nervous prostration. The proofthat he is the passive instrument of unseen entities controlling occultpotencies, seems conclusive. Even if Thury's ectenic and Crookes's psychic forceare substantially of the same derivation, the respective discoverers seem todiffer widely as to the properties and potencies of this force; while ProfessorThury candidly admits that the phenomena are often produced by \"wills nothuman,\" and so, of course, gives a qualified endorsement to Mr. Crookes's theoryNo. 6, the latter, admitting the genuineness of the phenomena, has as yetpronounced no definite opinion as to their cause. Thus, we find that neither M. Thury, who investigated these manifestations withde Gasparin in 1854, nor Mr. Crookes, who conceded their undeniable genuinenessin 1874, have reached anything definite. Both are chemists, physicists, and verylearned men. Both have given all their attention to the puzzling question; andbesides these two scientists there were many others who, while coming to thesame conclusion, have hitherto been as unable to furnish the world with a finalsolution. It follows then, that in twenty years none of the scientists have madea single step toward the unravelling of the mystery, which remains as immovableand impregnable as the walls of an enchanted castle in a fairy tale. Would it be too impertinent to surmise that perhaps our modern scientists havegot in what the French term un cercle vicieux? That, hampered by the weight oftheir materialism, and the insufficiency of what they name \"the exact sciences\"to demonstrate to them tangibly the existence of a spiritual universe, peopledand inhabited much more than our visible one, they are doomed forever to creeparound inside that circle, unwilling rather than unable to penetrate beyond itsenchanted ring, and explore it in its length and breadth? It is but prejudicewhich keeps them from making a compromise with well-established facts and seekalliance with such expert magnetists and mesmerizers as were Du Potet andRegazzoni. \"What, then, is produced from death?\" inquired Socrates of Cebes. \"Life,\" wasthe reply. * . . . \"Can the soul, since it is immortal, be anything else thanimperishable?\" ** The \"seed cannot develop unless it is in part consumed,\" saysProf. Lecomte; \"it is not quickened unless it die,\" says St. Paul. A flower blossoms; then withers and dies. It leaves a fragrance behind, which,long after its delicate petals are but a little dust, still lingers in the air.Our material sense may not be cognizant of it, but it nevertheless exists. Let anote be struck on an instrument, and the faintest sound produces an eternalecho. A disturbance is created on the invisible waves of the shoreless ocean ofspace, and the vibration is never wholly lost. Its energy being once carriedfrom the world of matter into the immaterial world will live for ever. And man,we are asked to believe, man, the living, thinking, reasoning entity, theindwelling deity of our nature's crowning masterpiece, will evacuate his casketand be no more! Would the principle of continuity which exists even for theso-called inorganic matter, for a floating atom, be denied to the spirit, whoseattributes are consciousness, memory, mind, LOVE! Really, the very idea ispreposterous. The more we think and the more we learn, the more difficult itbecomes for us to account for the atheism of the scientist. We may readilyunderstand that a man ignorant of the laws of nature, unlearned in eitherchemistry or physics, may be fatally drawn into materialism through his veryignorance; his incapacity of understanding the philosophy of the exact sciences,or drawing any inference by analogy from the visible to the invisible. Anatural-born metaphysician, an ignorant dreamer, may awake abruptly and say tohimself: \"I dreamed it; I have no tangible proof of that which I imagined; it isall illusion,\" etc. But for a man of science, acquainted with thecharacteristics of the universal energy, to maintain that life is merely aphenomenon of matter, a species of energy, amounts simply to a confession of hisown incapability of analyzing and properly understanding the alpha and the omegaeven of that--matter. Sincere skepticism as to the immortality of man's soul is a malady; amalformation of the physical brain, and has existed in every age. As there areinfants born with a caul upon their heads, so there are men who are incapable totheir last hour of ridding themselves of that kind of caul evidently envelopingtheir organs of spirituality. But it is quite another feeling which makes themreject the possibility of spiritual and magical phenomena. The true name forthat feeling is--vanity. \"We can neither produce nor explain it--hence, it doesnot exist, and moreover, could never have existed.\" Such is the irrefutableargument of our present-day philosophers. Some thirty years ago, E. Salvertestartled the world of the \"credulous\" by his work, The Philosophy of Magic. Thebook claimed to unveil the whole of the miracles of the Bible as well as thoseof the Pagan sanctuaries. Its resume ran thus: Long ages of observation; a greatknowledge (for those days of ignorance) of natural sciences and philosophy;imposture; legerdemain; optics; phantasmagoria; exaggeration. Final and logicalconclusion: Thaumaturgists, prophets, magicians, rascals, and knaves; the restof the world, fools. Among many other conclusive proofs, the reader can find him offering thefollowing: \"The enthusiastic disciples of Iamblichus affirmed that when heprayed, he was raised to the height of ten cubits from the ground; and dupes tothe same metaphor, although Christians, have had the simplicity to attribute asimilar miracle to St. Clare, and St. Francis of Assisi.\" * Hundreds of travellers claimed to have seen fakirs produce the same phenomena,and they were all thought either liars or hallucinated. But it was but yesterdaythat the same phenomenon was witnessed and endorsed by a well-known scientist;it was produced under test conditions; declared by Mr. Crookes to be genuine,and to be beyond the possibility of an illusion or a trick. And so was itmanifested many a time before and attested by numerous witnesses, though thelatter are now invariably disbelieved. Peace to thy scientific ashes, O credulous Eusebe Salverte! Who knows but beforethe close of the present century popular wisdom will have invented a newproverb: \"As incredibly credulous as a scientist.\" Why should it appear so impossible that when the spirit is once separated fromits body, it may have the power to animate some evanescent form, created out ofthat magical \"psychic\" or \"ectenic\" or \"ethereal\" force, with the help of theelementaries who furnish it with the sublimated matter of their own bodies? Theonly difficulty is, to realize the fact that surrounding space is not an emptyvoid, but a reservoir filled to repletion with the models of all things thatever were, that are, and that will be; and with beings of countless races,unlike our own. Seemingly supernatural facts--supernatural in that they openlycontradict the demonstrated natural laws of gravitation, as in theabove-mentioned instance of levitation--are recognized by many scientists. Everyone who has dared to investigate with thoroughness has found himself compelledto admit their existence; only in their unsuccessful efforts to account for thephenomena on theories based on the laws of such forces as were already known,some of the highest representatives of science have involved themselves ininextricable difficulties! In his Resume de Mirville describes the argumentation of these adversaries ofspiritualism as consisting of five paradoxes, which he terms distractions. First distraction: that of Faraday, who explains the table phenomenon, by thetable which pushes you \"in consequence of the resistance which pushes it back.\" Second distraction: that of Babinet, explaining all the communications (by raps)which are produced, as he says, \"in good faith and with perfectconscientiousness, correct in every way and sense--by ventriloquism,\" the use ofwhich faculty implies of necessity--bad faith. Third distraction: that of Dr. Chevreuil, explaining the faculty of movingfurniture without contact, by the preliminary acquisition of that faculty. Fourth distraction: that of the French Institute and its members, who consent toaccept the miracles, on condition that the latter will not contradict in any waythose natural laws with which they are acquainted. Fifth distraction: that of M. de Gasparin, introducing as a very simple andperfectly elementary phenomenon that which every one rejects, precisely becauseno one ever saw the like of it. * While the great, world-known scientists indulge in such fantastic theories, someless known neurologists find an explanation for occult phenomena of every kindin an abnormal effluvium resulting from epilepsy. * Another would treatmediums--and poets, too, we may infer--with assafoetida and ammonia, ** anddeclare every one of the believers in spiritual manifestations lunatics andhallucinated mystics. To the latter lecturer and professed pathologist is commended that sensible bitof advice to be found in the New Testament: \"Physician, heal thyself.\" Truly, nosane man would so sweepingly charge insanity upon four hundred and forty-sixmillions of people in various parts of the world, who believe in the intercourseof spirits with ourselves! Considering all this, it remains to us but to wonder at the preposterouspresumption of these men, who claim to be regarded by right of learning as thehigh priests of science, to classify a phenomenon they know nothing about.Surely, several millions of their countrymen and women, if deluded, deserve atleast as much attention as potato-bugs or grasshoppers! But, instead of that,what do we find? The Congress of the United States, at the demand of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, enacts statutes fororganization of National Insect Commissions; chemists are busying themselves inboiling frogs and bugs; geologists amuse their leisure by osteological surveysof armor-plated ganoids, and discuss the odontology of the various species ofdinichtys; and entomologists suffer their enthusiasm to carry them to the lengthof supping on grasshoppers boiled, fried, and in soup. *** Meanwhile, millionsof Americans are either losing themselves in the maze of \"crazy delusions,\"according to the opinion of some of these very learned encyclopaedists, orperishing physically from \"nervous disorders,\" brought on or brought out bymediumistic diathesis. At one time, there was reason to hope that Russian scientists would haveundertaken the task of giving the phenomena a careful and impartial study. Acommission was appointed by the Imperial University of St. Petersburg, withProfessor Mendeleyeff, the great physicist, at its head. The advertisedprogramme provided for a series of forty seances to test mediums, andinvitations were extended to all of this class who chose to come to the Russiancapital and submit their powers to examination. As a rule theyrefused--doubtless from a prevision of the trap that had been laid for them.After eight sittings, upon a shallow pretext, and just when the manifestationswere becoming interesting, the commission prejudged the case, and published adecision adverse to the claims of mediumism. Instead of pursuing dignified,scientific methods, they set spies to peep through the key-holes. ProfessorMendeleyeff declared in a public lecture that spiritualism, or any such beliefin our souls' immortality, was a mixture of superstition, delusion, and fraud;adding that every \"manifestation\" of such nature--including mind-reading,trance, and other psychological phenomena, we must suppose--could be, and wasproduced by means of clever apparatus and machinery concealed under the clothingof mediums! After such a public exhibition of ignorance and prejudice, Mr. Butlerof,Professor of Chemistry at the St. Petersburg University, and Mr. Aksakof,Counsellor of State in the same city, who had been invited to assist on thecommittee for mediums, became so disgusted that they withdrew. Having publishedtheir protests in the Russian papers, they were supported by the majority of thepress, who did not spare either Mendeleyeff or his officious committee withtheir sarcasms. The public acted fairly in that case. One hundred and thirtynames, of the most influential persons of the best society of St. Petersburg,many of them no spiritualists at all, but simply investigators, added theirsignatures to the well-deserved protest. The inevitable result of such a procedure followed; universal attention wasdrawn to the question of spiritualism; private circles were organized throughoutthe empire; some of the most liberal journals began to discuss the subject; and,as we write, a new commission is being organized to finish the interrupted task. But now--as a matter of course--they will do their duty less than ever. Theyhave a better pretext than they ever had in the pretended expose of the mediumSlade, by Professor Lankester, of London. True, to the evidence of one scientistand his friend,--Messrs. Lankester and Donkin--the accused opposed the testimonyof Wallace, Crookes, and a host of others, which totally nullifies an accusationbased merely on circumstantial evidence and prejudice. As the London Spectatorvery pertinently observes: \"It is really a pure superstition and nothing else to assume that we are sofully acquainted with the laws of nature, that even carefully examined facts,attested by an experienced observer, ought to be cast aside as utterly unworthyof credit, only because they do not, at first sight, seem to be in keeping withwhat is most clearly known already. To assume, as Professor Lankester appears todo, that because there are fraud and credulity in plenty to be found inconnection with these facts--as there is, no doubt, in connection with allnervous diseases--fraud and credulity will account for all the carefullyattested statements of accurate and conscientious observers, is to saw away atthe very branch of the tree of knowledge on which inductive science necessarilyrests, and to bring the whole structure toppling to the ground.\" But what matters all this to scientists? The torrent of superstition, which,according to them, sweeps away millions of bright intellects in its impetuouscourse, cannot reach them. The modern deluge called spiritualism is unable toaffect their strong minds; and the muddy waves of the flood must expend theirraging fury without wetting even the soles of their boots. Surely it must be buttraditional stubbornness on the part of the Creator that prevents him fromconfessing what a poor chance his miracles have in our day in blinding professedscientists. By this time even He ought to know and take notice that long agothey decided to write on the porticoes of their universities and colleges: Science commands that God shall notDo miracles upon this spot! *Both the infidel spiritualists and the orthodox Roman Catholics seem to haveleagued themselves this year against the iconoclastic pretensions ofmaterialism. Increase of skepticism has developed of late a like increase ofcredulity. The champions of the Bible \"divine\" miracles rival the panegyrist'smediumistic phenomena, and the middle ages revive in the nineteenth century.Once more we see the Virgin Mary resume her epistolary correspondence with thefaithful children of her church; and while the \"angel friends\" scribble messagesto spiritualists through their mediums, the \"mother of God\" drops letters directfrom heaven to earth. The shrine of Notre Dame de Lourdes has turned into aspiritualistic cabinet for \"materializations,\" while the cabinets of popularAmerican mediums are transformed into sacred shrines, into which Mohammed,Bishop Polk, Joan of Arc and other aristocratic spirits from over the \"darkriver,\" having descended, \"materialize\" in full light. And if the Virgin Mary isseen taking her daily walk in the woods about Lourdes in full human form, whynot the Apostle of Islam, and the late Bishop of Louisiana? Either both\"miracles\" are possible, or both kinds of these manifestations, the \"divine\" aswell as the \"spiritual,\" are arrant impostures. Time alone will prove which; butmeanwhile, as science refuses the loan of her magic lamp to illuminate thesemysteries, common people must go stumbling on whether they be mired or not. The recent \"miracles\" at Lourdes having been unfavorably discussed in the Londonpapers, Monsignor Capel communicates to the Times the views of the Roman Churchin the following terms: \"As to the miraculous cures which are effected, I would refer your readers tothe calm, judicious work, La Grotte de Lourdes, written by Dr. Dozous, aneminent resident practitioner, inspector of epidemic diseases for the district,and medical assistant of the Court of Justice. He prefaces a number of detailedcases of miraculous cures, which he says he has studied with great care andperseverance, with these words: 'I declare that these cures effected at theSanctuary of Lourdes by means of the water of the fountain, have establishedtheir supernatural character in the eyes of men of good faith. I ought toconfess that without these cures, my mind, little prone to listen to miraculousexplanations of any kind, would have had great difficulty in accepting even thisfact (the apparition), remarkable as it is from so many points of view. But thecures, of which I have been so often an ocular witness, have given to my mind alight which does not permit me to ignore the importance of the visits ofBernadette to the Grotto, and the reality of the apparitions with which she wasfavored.' The testimony of a distinguished medical man, who has carefullywatched from the beginning Bernadette, and the miraculous cures at the Grotto,is at least worthy of respectful consideration. I may add, that the vast numberof those who come to the Grotto do so to repent of their sins, to increase theirpiety, to pray for the regeneration of their country, to profess publicly theirbelief in the Son of God and his Immaculate Mother. Many come to be cured ofbodily ailments; and on the testimony of eye-witnesses several return home freedfrom their sickness. To upbraid with non-belief, as does your article, those whouse also the waters of the Pyrenees, is as reasonable as to charge with unbeliefthe magistrates who inflict punishment on the peculiar people for neglecting tohave medical aid. Health obliged me to pass the winters of 1860 to 1867 at Pau.This gave me the opportunity of making the most minute inquiry into theapparition at Lourdes. After frequent and lengthened examinations of Bernadetteand of some of the miracles effected, I am convinced that, if facts are to bereceived on human testimony, then has the apparition at Lourdes every claim tobe received as an undeniable fact. It is, however, no part of the Catholicfaith, and may be accepted or rejected by any Catholic without the least praiseor condemnation.\" Let the reader observe the sentence we have italicized. This makes it clear thatthe Catholic Church, despite her infallibility and her liberal postageconvention with the Kingdom of Heaven, is content to accept even the validity ofdivine miracles upon human testimony. Now when we turn to the report of Mr.Huxley's recent New York lectures on evolution, we find him saying that it isupon \"human historical evidence that we depend for the greater part of ourknowledge for the doings of the past.\" In a lecture on Biology, he has said \" .. . every man who has the interest of truth at heart must earnestly desire thatevery well-founded and just criticism that can be made should be made; but it isessential . . . that the critic should know what he is talking about.\" Anaphorism that its author should recall when he undertakes to pronounce uponpsychological subjects. Add this to his views, as expressed above, and who couldask a better platform upon which to meet him? Here we have a representative materialist, and a representative Catholicprelate, enunciating an identical view of the sufficiency of human testimony toprove facts that it suits the prejudices of each to believe. After this, whatneed for either the student of occultism, or even the spiritualist, to huntabout for endorsements of the argument they have so long and so persistentlyadvanced, that the psychological phenomena of ancient and modern thaumaturgistsbeing superabundantly proven upon human testimony must be accepted as facts?Church and College having appealed to the tribunal of human evidence, theycannot deny the rest of mankind an equal privilege. One of the fruits of therecent agitation in London of the subject of mediumistic phenomena, is theexpression of some remarkably liberal views on the part of the secular press.\"In any case, we are for admitting spiritualism to a place among toleratedbeliefs, and letting it alone accordingly,\" says the London Daily News, in 1876.\"It has many votaries who are as intelligent as most of us, and to whom anyobvious and palpable defect in the evidence meant to convince must have beenobvious and palpable long ago. Some of the wisest men in the world believed inghosts, and would have continued to do so even though half-a-dozen persons insuccession had been convicted of frightening people with sham goblins.\" It is not for the first time in the history of the world, that the invisibleworld has to contend against the materialistic skepticism of soul-blindSadducees. Plato deplores such an unbelief, and refers to this pernicioustendency more than once in his works. From Kapila, the Hindu philosopher, who many centuries before Christ demurred tothe claim of the mystic Yogins, that in ecstasy a man has the power of seeingDeity face to face and conversing with the \"highest\" beings, down to theVoltaireans of the eighteenth century, who laughed at everything that was heldsacred by other people, each age had its unbelieving Thomases. Did they eversucceed in checking the progress of truth? No more than the ignorant bigots whosat in judgment over Galileo checked the progress of the earth's rotation. Noexposures whatever are able to vitally affect the stability or instability of abelief which humanity inherited from the first races of men, those, who--if wecan believe in the evolution of spiritual man as in that of the physicalone--had the great truth from the lips of their ancestors, the gods of theirfathers, \"that were on the other side of the flood.\" The identity of the Biblewith the legends of the Hindu sacred books and the cosmogonies of other nations,must be demonstrated at some future day. The fables of the mythopoeic ages willbe found to have but allegorized the greatest truths of geology andanthropology. It is in these ridiculously expressed fables that science willhave to look for her \"missing links.\" Otherwise, whence such strange \"coincidences\" in the respective histories ofnations and peoples so widely thrown apart? Whence that identity of primitiveconceptions which, fables and legends though they are termed now, contain inthem nevertheless the kernel of historical facts, of a truth thickly overgrownwith the husks of popular embellishment, but still a truth? Compare only thisverse of Genesis vi.: \"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on theface of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God sawthe daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all whichthey chose. . . . There were giants in the earth in those days,\" etc., with thispart of the Hindu cosmogony, in the Vedas, which speaks of the descent of theBrahmans. The first Brahman complains of being alone among all his brethrenwithout a wife. Notwithstanding that the Eternal advises him to devote his dayssolely to the study of the Sacred Knowledge (Veda), the first-born of mankindinsists. Provoked at such ingratitude, the eternal gave Brahman a wife of therace of the Daints, or giants, from whom all the Brahmans maternally descend.Thus the entire Hindu priesthood is descended, on the one hand, from thesuperior spirits (the sons of God), and from Daintany, a daughter of the earthlygiants, the primitive men. * \"And they bare children to them; the same becamemighty men which were of old; men of renown.\" ** The same is found in the Scandinavian cosmogonical fragment. In the Edda isgiven the description to Gangler by Har, one of the three informants (Har,Jafuhar, and Tredi) of the first man, called Bur, \"the father of Bor, who tookfor wife Besla, a daughter of the giant Bolthara, of the race of the primitivegiants.\" The full and interesting narrative may be found in the Prose Edda,sects. 4-8, in Mallett's Northern Antiquities. *** The same groundwork underlies the Grecian fables about the Titans; and may befound in the legend of the Mexicans--the four successive races of Popol-Vuh. Itconstitutes one of the many ends to be found in the entangled and seeminglyinextricable skein of mankind, viewed as a psychological phenomenon. Belief insupernaturalism would be otherwise inexplicable. To say that it sprang up, andgrew and developed throughout the countless ages, without either cause or theleast firm basis to rest upon, but merely as an empty fancy, would be to utteras great an absurdity as the theological doctrine that the universe sprang intocreation out of nothing. It is too late now to kick against an evidence which manifests itself as in thefull glare of noon. Liberal, as well as Christian papers, and the organs of themost advanced scientific authorities, begin to protest unanimously against thedogmatism and narrow prejudices of sciolism. The Christian World, a religiouspaper, adds its voice to that of the unbelieving London press. Following is agood specimen of its common sense: \"If a medium,\" it says, * \"can be shown ever so conclusively to be an impostor,we shall still object to the disposition manifested by persons of some authorityin scientific matters, to pooh-pooh and knock on the head all careful inquiryinto those subjects of which Mr. Barrett took note in his paper before theBritish Association. Because spiritualists have committed themselves to manyabsurdities, that is no reason why the phenomena to which they appeal should bescouted as unworthy of examination. They may be mesmeric, or clairvoyant, orsomething else. But let our wise men tell us what they are, and not snub us, asignorant people too often snub inquiring youth, by the easy but unsatisfactoryapothegm, 'Little children should not ask questions.' \" Thus the time has come when the scientists have lost all right to be addressedwith the Miltonian verse, \"O thou who, for the testimony of truth, hast borneuniversal reproach!\" Sad degeneration, and one that recalls the exclamation ofthat \"doctor of physic\" mentioned one hundred and eighty years ago by Dr. HenryMore, and who, upon hearing the story told of the drummer of Tedworth and of AnnWalker, \"cryed out presently, If this be true, I have been in a wrong box allthis time, and must begin my account anew.\" ** But in our century, notwithstanding Huxley's endorsement of the value of \"humantestimony,\" even Dr. Henry More has become \"an enthusiast and a visionary, bothof which, united in the same person, constitute a canting madman.\" *** What psychology has long lacked to make its mysterious laws better understoodand applied to the ordinary as well as extraordinary affairs of life, is notfacts. These it has had in abundance. The need has been for their recording andclassification--for trained observers and competent analysts. From thescientific body these ought to have been supplied. If error has prevailed andsuperstition run riot these many centuries throughout Christendom, it is themisfortune of the common people, the reproach of science. The generations havecome and gone, each furnishing its quota of martyrs to conscience and moralcourage, and psychology is little better understood in our day than it was whenthe heavy hand of the Vatican sent those brave unfortunates to their untimelydoom, and branded their memories with the stigma of heresy and sorcery.

Sir E. Bulwer-Lytton, in his Coming Race, describes it as the VRIL, ** used bythe subterranean populations, and allowed his readers to take it for a fiction.\"These people,\" he says, \"consider that in the vril they had arrived at theunity in natural energic agencies\"; and proceeds to show that Faraday intimatedthem \"under the more cautious term of correlation,\" thus: \"I have long held an opinion, almost amounting to a conviction, in common, Ibelieve, with many other lovers of natural knowledge, that the various formsunder which the forces of matter are made manifest, HAVE ONE COMMON ORIGIN; or,in other words, are so directly related and naturally dependent, that they areconvertible, as it were, into one another, and possess equivalents of power intheir action.\" Absurd and unscientific as may appear our comparison of a fictitious vrilinvented by the great novelist, and the primal force of the equally greatexperimentalist, with the kabalistic astral light, it is nevertheless the truedefinition of this force. Discoveries are constantly being made to corroboratethe statement thus boldly put forth. Since we began to write this part of ourbook, an announcement has been made in a number of papers of the supposeddiscovery of a new force by Mr. Edison, the electrician, of Newark, New Jersey,which force seems to have little in common with electricity, or galvanism,except the principle of conductivity. If demonstrated, it may remain for a longtime under some pseudonymous scientific name; but, nevertheless, it will be butone of the numerous family of children brought forth from the commencement oftime by our kabalistic mother, the Astral Virgin. In fact, the discoverer saysthat, \"it is as distinct, and has as regular laws as heat, magnetism, orelectricity.\" The journal which contains the first account of the discovery addsthat, \"Mr. Edison thinks that it exists in connection with heat, and that it canalso be generated by independent and as yet undiscovered means.\" Another of the most startling of recent discoveries, is the possibility ofannihilating distance between human voices--by means of the telephone(distance-sounder), an instrument invented by Professor A. Graham Bell. Thispossibility, first suggested by the little \"lovers' telegraph,\" consisting ofsmall tin cups with vellum and drug-twine apparatus, by which a conversation canbe carried on at a distance of two hundred feet, has developed into thetelephone, which will become the wonder of this age. A long conversation hastaken place between Boston and Cambridgeport by telegraph; \"every word beingdistinctly heard and perfectly understood, and the modulations of voices beingquite distinguishable,\" according to the official report. The voice is seizedupon, so to say, and held in form by a magnet, and the sound-wave transmitted byelectricity acting in unison and co-operating with the magnet. The whole successdepends upon a perfect control of the electric currents and the power of themagnets used, with which the former must co-operate. \"The invention,\" reportsthe paper, \"may be rudely described as a sort of trumpet, over the bell-mouth ofwhich is drawn a delicate membrane, which, when the voice is thrown into thetube, swells outward in proportion to the force of the sound-wave. To the outerside of the membrane is attached a piece of metal, which, as the membrane swellsoutward, connects with a magnet, and this, with the electric circuit, iscontrolled by the operator. By some principle, not yet fully understood, theelectric current transmits the sound-wave just as delivered by the voice in thetrumpet, and the listener at the other end of the line, with a twin or facsimiletrumpet at his ear, hears every word distinctly, and readily detects themodulations of the speaker's voice.\" Thus, in the presence of such wonderful discoveries of our age, and the furthermagical possibilities lying latent and yet undiscovered in the boundless realmof nature, and further, in view of the great probability that Edison's Force andProfessor Graham Bell's Telephone may unsettle, if not utterly upset all ourideas of the imponderable fluids, would it not be well for such persons as maybe tempted to traverse our statements, to wait and see whether they will becorroborated or refuted by further discoveries. Only in connection with these discoveries, we may, perhaps, well remind ourreaders of the many hints to be found in the ancient histories as to a certainsecret in the possession of the Egyptian priesthood, who could instantlycommunicate, during the celebration of the Mysteries, from one temple toanother, even though the former were at Thebes and the latter at the other endof the country; the legends attributing it, as a matter of course, to the\"invisible tribes\" of the air, which carry messages for mortals. The author ofPre-Adamite Man quotes an instance, which being given merely on his ownauthority, and he seeming uncertain whether the story comes from Macrinus orsome other writer, may be taken for what it is worth. He found good evidence, hesays, during his stay in Egypt, that \"one of the Cleopatras (?) sent news by awire to all the cities, from Heliopolis to Elephantine, on the Upper Nile.\" * It is not so long since Professor Tyndall ushered us into a new world, peopledwith airy shapes of the most ravishing beauty. \"The discovery consists,\" he says, \"in subjecting the vapors of volatile liquidsto the action of concentrated sun-light, or to the concentrated beam of theelectric light.\" The vapors of certain nitrites, iodides, and acids aresubjected to the action of the light in an experimental tube, lyinghorizontally, and so arranged that the axis of the tube and that of the parallelbeams issuing from the lamp are coincident. The vapors form clouds of gorgeoustints, and arrange themselves into the shapes of vases, of bottles and cones, innests of six or more; of shells, of tulips, roses, sunflowers, leaves, and ofinvolved scrolls. \"In one case,\" he tells us, \"the cloud-bud grew rapidly into aserpent's head; a mouth was formed, and from the cloud, a cord of cloudresembling a tongue was discharged.\" Finally, to cap the climax of marvels,\"once it positively assumed the form of a fish, with eyes, gills, and feelers.The twoness of the animal form was displayed throughout, and no disk, coil, orspeck existed on one side that did not exist on the other.\" These phenomena may possibly be explained in part by the mechanical action of abeam of light, which Mr. Crookes has recently demonstrated. For instance, it isa supposable case, that the beams of light may have constituted a horizontalaxis, about which the disturbed molecules of the vapors gathered into the formsof globes and spindles. But how account for the fish, the serpent's head, thevases, the flowers of different varieties, the shells? This seems to offer adilemma to science as baffling as the meteor-cat of Babinet. We do not learnthat Tyndall ventured as absurd an explanation of his extraordinary phenomena asthat of the Frenchman about his. Those who have not given attention to the subject may be surprised to find howmuch was known in former days of that all-pervading, subtile principle which hasrecently been baptized THE UNIVERSAL ETHER. Before proceeding, we desire once more to enunciate in two categoricalpropositions, what was hinted at before. These propositions were demonstratedlaws with the ancient theurgists. I. The so-called miracles, to begin with Moses and end with Cagliostro, whengenuine, were as de Gasparin very justly insinuates in his work on thephenomena, \"perfectly in accordance with natural law\"; hence--no miracles.Electricity and magnetism were unquestionably used in the production of some ofthe prodigies; but now, the same as then, they are put in requisition by everysensitive, who is made to use unconsciously these powers by the peculiar natureof his or her organization, which serves as a conductor for some of theseimponderable fluids, as yet so imperfectly known to science. This force is theprolific parent of numberless attributes and properties, many, or rather, mostof which, are as yet unknown to modern physics. II. The phenomena of natural magic to be witnessed in Siam, India, Egypt, andother Oriental countries, bear no relationship whatever to sleight of hand; theone being an absolute physical effect, due to the action of occult naturalforces, the other, a mere deceptive result obtained by dexterous manipulationssupplemented with confederacy. * The thaumaturgists of all periods, schools, and countries, produced theirwonders, because they were perfectly familiar with the imponderable--in theireffects--but otherwise perfectly tangible waves of the astral light. Theycontrolled the currents by guiding them with their will-power. The wonders wereboth of physical and psychological character; the former embracing effectsproduced upon material objects, the latter the mental phenomena of Mesmer andhis successors. This class has been represented in our time by two illustriousmen, Du Potet and Regazzoni, whose wonderful powers were well attested in Franceand other countries. Mesmerism is the most important branch of magic; and itsphenomena are the effects of the universal agent which underlies all magic andhas produced at all ages the so-called miracles. The ancients called it Chaos; Plato and the Pythagoreans named it the Soul ofthe World. According to the Hindus, the Deity in the shape of Æther pervades allthings. It is the invisible, but, as we have said before, too tangible Fluid.Among other names this universal Proteus--or \"the nebulous Almighty,\" as deMirville calls it in derision--was termed by the theurgists \"the livingfire,\" ** the \"Spirit of Light,\" and Magnes. This last appellation indicates itsmagnetic properties and shows its magical nature. For, as truly expressed by oneof its enemies--μαγος and μαγνες are two branches growing from the same trunk,and shooting forth the same resultants. Magnetism is a word for the derivation of which we have to look to an incrediblyearly epoch. The stone called magnet is believed by many to owe its name toMagnesia, a city or district in Thessaly, where these stones were found inquantity. We believe, however, the opinion of the Hermetists to be the correctone. The word Magh, magus, is derived from the Sanskrit Mahaji, the great orwise (the anointed by the divine wisdom). \"Eumolpus is the mythic founder of theEumolpidae (priests); the priests traced their own wisdom to the DivineIntelligence.\" * The various cosmogonies show that the Archaeal Universal Soulwas held by every nation as the \"mind\" of the Demiurgic Creator, the Sophia ofthe Gnostics, or the Holy Ghost as a female principle. As the Magi derived theirname from it, so the Magnesian stone or Magnet was called in their honor, forthey were the first to discover its wonderful properties. Their temples dottedthe country in all directions, and among these were some temples ofHercules, **--hence the stone, when it once became known that the priests usedit for their curative and magical purposes, received the name of the Magnesianor Heraclean stone. Socrates, speaking of it, remarks: \"Euripides calls it theMagnesian stone, but the common people, the Heraclean.\" *** It was the countryand stone which were called after the Magi, not the Magi after one or the other.Pliny informs us that the wedding-ring among the Romans was magnetized by thepriests before the ceremony. The old Pagan historians are careful to keep silenton certain Mysteries of the \"wise\" (Magi) and Pausanias was warned in a dream,he says, not to unveil the holy rites of the temple of Demeter and Persephoneiaat Athens. **** Modern science, after having ineffectually denied animal magnetism, has foundherself forced to accept it as a fact. It is now a recognized property of humanand animal organization; as to its psychological, occult influence, theAcademies battle with it, in our century, more ferociously than ever. It is themore to be regretted and even wondered at, as the representatives of \"exactscience\" are unable to either explain or even offer us anything like areasonable hypothesis for the undeniable mysterious potency contained in asimple magnet. We begin to have daily proofs that these potencies underlie thetheurgic mysteries, and therefore might perhaps explain the occult facultiespossessed by ancient and modern thaumaturgists as well as a good many of theirmost astounding achievements. Such were the gifts transmitted by Jesus to someof his disciples. At the moment of his miraculous cures, the Nazarene felt apower issuing from him. Socrates, in his dialogue with Theages, * telling him ofhis familiar god (demon), and his power of either imparting his (Socrates')wisdom to his disciples or preventing it from benefiting those he associateswith, brings the following instance in corroboration of his words: \"I will tellyou, Socrates,\" says Aristides, \"a thing incredible, indeed, by the gods, buttrue. I made a proficiency when I associated with you, even if I was only in thesame house, though not in the same room; but more so, when I was in the sameroom . . . and much more when I looked at you. . . . But I made by far thegreatest proficiency when I sat near you and touched you.\" This is the modern magnetism and mesmerism of Du Potet and other masters, who,when they have subjected a person to their fluidic influence, can impart to themall their thoughts even at a distance, and with an irresistible power forcetheir subject to obey their mental orders. But how far better was this psychicforce known to the ancient philosophers! We can glean some information on thatsubject from the earliest sources. Pythagoras taught his disciples that God isthe universal mind diffused through all things, and that this mind by the solevirtue of its universal sameness could be communicated from one object toanother and be made to create all things by the sole will-power of man. With theancient Greeks, Kurios was the god-Mind (Nous). \"Now Koros (Kurios) signifiesthe pure and unmixed nature of intellect--wisdom,\" says Plato. ** Kurios isMercury, the Divine Wisdom, and \"Mercury is the Sol\" (Sun), *** from whomThaut--Hermes--received this divine wisdom, which, in his turn, he imparted tothe world in his books. Hercules is also the Sun--the celestial storehouse ofthe universal magnetism; **** or rather Hercules is the magnetic light which,when having made its way through the \"opened eye of heaven,\" enters into theregions of our planet and thus becomes the Creator. Hercules passes through thetwelve labors, the valiant Titan! He is called \"Father of All\" and \"self-born\"\"(autophues).\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu004.htm#fn_191] Hercules,the Sun, is killed by the Devil, Typhon, ** and so is Osiris, who is the fatherand brother of Horus, and at the same time is identical with him; and we mustnot forget that the magnet was called the \"bone of Horus,\" and iron the \"bone ofTyphon.\" He is called \"Hercules Invictus,\" only when he descends to Hades (thesubterranean garden), and plucking the \"golden apples\" from the \"tree of life,\"slays the dragon. *** The rough Titanic power, the \"lining\" of every sun-god,opposes its force of blind matter to the divine magnetic spirit, which tries toharmonize everything in nature. All the sun-gods, with their symbol, the visible sun, are the creators ofphysical nature only. The spiritual is the work of the Highest God--theConcealed, the Central, Spiritual SUN, and of his Demiurge--the Divine Mind ofPlato, and the Divine Wisdom of Hermes Trismegistus ****--the wisdom effusedfrom Oulom or Kronos. \"After the distribution of pure Fire, in the Samothracian Mysteries, a new lifebegan.\" ***** This was the \"new birth,\" that is alluded to by Jesus, in hisnocturnal conversation with Nicodemus. \"Initiated into the most blessed of allMysteries, being ourselves pure . . . we become just and holy withwisdom.\" ****** \"He breathed on them and saith unto them, 'Take the HolyPneuma.' \" ******* And this simple act of will-power was sufficient to impartvaticination in its nobler and most perfect form if both the initiator and theinitiated were worthy of it. To deride this gift, even in its present aspect,\"as the corrupt offspring and lingering remains of an ignorant age ofsuperstition, and hastily to condemn it as unworthy of sober investigation,would be as unphilosophical as it is wrong,\" remarks the Rev. J. B. Gross. \"Toremove the veil which hides our vision from the future, has been attempted--inall ages of the world; and therefore the propensity to pry into the lap of time,contemplated as one of the faculties of human mind, comes recommended to usunder the sanction of God. . . . Zuinglius, the Swiss reformer, attested thecomprehensiveness of his faith in the providence of the Supreme Being, in thecosmopolitan doctrine that the Holy Ghost was not excluded from the more worthyportion of the heathen world. Admitting its truth, we cannot easily conceive avalid reason why a heathen, thus favored, should not be capable of trueprophecy.\" * Now, what is this mystic, primordial substance? In the book of Genesis, at thebeginning of the first chapter, it is termed the \"face of the waters,\" said tohave been incubated by the \"Spirit of God.\" Job mentions, in chap. xxvi., 5,that \"dead things are formed from under the waters, and inhabitants thereof.\" Inthe original text, instead of \"dead things,\" it is written dead Rephaim (giants,or mighty primitive men), from whom \"Evolution\" may one day trace our presentrace. In the Egyptian mythology, Kneph the Eternal unrevealed God is representedby a snake-emblem of eternity encircling a water-urn, with his head hoveringover the waters, which it incubates with his breath. In this case the serpent isthe Agathodaimon, the good spirit; in its opposite aspect it is theKakodaimon--the bad one. In the Scandinavian Eddas, the honey-dew--the food ofthe gods and of the creative, busy Yggdrasill--bees--falls during the hours ofnight, when the atmosphere is impregnated with humidity; and in the Northernmythologies, as the passive principle of creation, it typifies the creation ofthe universe out of water; this dew is the astral light in one of itscombinations and possesses creative as well as destructive properties. In theChaldean legend of Berosus, Oannes or Dagon, the man-fish, instructing thepeople, shows the infant world created out of water and all beings originatingfrom this prima materia. Moses teaches that only earth and water can bring aliving soul; and we read in the Scriptures that herbs could not grow until theEternal caused it to rain upon earth. In the Mexican Popol-Vuh man is createdout of mud or clay (terre glaise), taken from under the water. Brahma createsLomus, the great Muni (or first man), seated on his lotus, only after havingcalled into being, spirits, who thus enjoyed among mortals a priority ofexistence, and he creates him out of water, air, and earth. Alchemists claimthat primordial or pre-Adamic earth when reduced to its first substance is inits second stage of transformation like clear-water, the first being thealkahest ** proper. This primordial substance is said to contain within itselfthe essence of all that goes to make up man; it has not only all the elements ofhis physical being, but even the \"breath of life\" itself in a latent state,ready to be awakened. This it derives from the \"incubation\" of the Spirit of Godupon the face of the waters--chaos; in fact, this substance is chaos itself.From this it was that Paracelsus claimed to be able to make his \"homunculi\"; andthis is why Thales, the great natural philosopher, maintained that water was theprinciple of all things in nature. What is the primordial Chaos but Æther? The modern Ether; not such as isrecognized by our scientists, but such as it was known to the ancientphilosophers, long before the time of Moses; Ether, with all its mysterious andoccult properties, containing in itself the germs of universal creation; Ether,the celestial virgin, the spiritual mother of every existing form and being,from whose bosom as soon as \"incubated\" by the Divine Spirit, are called intoexistence Matter and Life, Force and Action. Electricity, magnetism, heat,light, and chemical action are so little understood even now that fresh factsare constantly widening the range of our knowledge. Who knows where ends thepower of this protean giant--Ether; or whence its mysterious origin?--Who, wemean, that denies the spirit that works in it and evolves out of it all visibleforms? It is an easy task to show that the cosmogonical legends all over the world arebased on a knowledge by the ancients of those sciences which have alliedthemselves in our days to support the doctrine of evolution; and that furtherresearch may demonstrate that they were far better acquainted with the fact ofevolution itself, embracing both its physical and spiritual aspects, than we arenow. With the old philosophers, evolution was a universal theorem, a doctrineembracing the whole, and an established principle; while our modernevolutionists are enabled to present us merely with speculative theoretics; withparticular, if not wholly negative theorems. It is idle for the representativesof our modern wisdom to close the debate and pretend that the question issettled, merely because the obscure phraseology of the Mosaic account clasheswith the definite exegesis of \"exact science.\" One fact at least is proved: there is not a cosmogonical fragment, to whatevernation it may belong, but proves by this universal allegory of water and thespirit brooding over it, that no more than our modern physicists did any of themhold the universe to have sprung into existence out of nothing; for all theirlegends begin with that period when nascent vapors and Cimmerian darkness laybrooding over a fluid mass ready to start on its journey of activity at thefirst flutter of the breath of Him, who is the Unrevealed One. Him they felt, ifthey saw Him not. Their spiritual intuitions were not so darkened by the subtilesophistry of the forecoming ages as ours are now. If they talked less of theSilurian age slowly developing into the Mammalian, and if the Cenozoic time wasonly recorded by various allegories of the primitive man--the Adam of ourrace--it is but a negative proof after all that their \"wise men\" and leaders didnot know of these successive periods as well as we do now. In the days of Democritus and Aristotle, the cycle had already begun to enter onits downward path of progress. And if these two philosophers could discuss sowell the atomic theory and trace the atom to its material or physical point,their ancestors may have gone further still and followed its genesis far beyondthat limit where Mr. Tyndall and others seem rooted to the spot, not daring tocross the line of the \"Incomprehensible.\" The lost arts are a sufficient proofthat if even their achievements in physiography are now doubted, because of theunsatisfactory writings of their physicists and naturalists,--on the other handtheir practical knowledge in phytochemistry and mineralogy far exceeded our own.Furthermore, they might have been perfectly acquainted with the physical historyof our globe without publishing their knowledge to the ignorant masses in thoseages of religious Mysteries. [images/00003.jpg] Therefore, it is not only from the Mosaic books that we mean to adduce proof forour further arguments. The ancient Jews got all their knowledge--religious aswell as profane--from the nations with which we see them mixed up from theearliest periods. Even the oldest of all sciences, their kabalistic \"secretdoctrine,\" may be traced in each detail to its primeval source, Upper India, orTurkestan, far before the time of a distinct separation between the Aryan andSemitic nations. The King Solomon so celebrated by posterity, as Josephus thehistorian says, * for his magical skill, got his secret learning from Indiathrough Hiram, the king of Ophir, and perhaps Sheba. His ring, commonly known as\"Solomon's seal,\" so celebrated for the potency of its sway over the variouskinds of genii and demons, in all the popular legends, is equally of Hinduorigin. Writing on the pretentious and abominable skill of the\"devil-worshippers\" of Travancore, the Rev. Samuel Mateer, of the LondonMissionary Society, claims at the same time to be in possession of a very oldmanuscript volume of magical incantations and spells in the Malayalim language,giving directions for effecting a great variety of purposes. Of course he adds,that \"many of these are fearful in their malignity and obscenity,\" and gives inhis work the fac-simile of some amulets bearing the magical figures and designson them. We find among them one with the following legend: \"To remove tremblingarising from demoniacal possession--write this figure on a plant that has milkyjuice, and drive a nail through it; the trembling will cease.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu004.htm#fn_201] The figure is theidentical Solomon's seal, or double triangle of the Kabalists. Did the Hindu getit from the Jewish kabalist, or the latter from India, by inheritance from theirgreat king-kabalist, the wise Solomon? ** But we will leave this triflingdispute to continue the more interesting question of the astral light, and itsunknown properties. Admitting, then, that this mythical agent is Ether, we will proceed to see whatand how much of it is known to science. With respect to the various effects of the different solar rays, Robert Hunt, F.R. S., remarks, in his Researches on Light in its Chemical Relations, that: \"Those rays which give the most light--the yellow and the orange rays--will notproduce change of color in the chloride of silver\"; while \"those rays which havethe least illuminating power--the blue and violet--produce the greatest change,and in exceedingly short time. . . . The yellow glasses obstruct scarcely anylight; the blue glasses may be so dark as to admit of the permeation of a verysmall quantity.\" And still we see that under the blue ray both vegetable and animal life manifestan inordinate development, while under the yellow ray it is proportionatelyarrested. How is it possible to account for this satisfactorily upon any otherhypothesis than that both animal and vegetable life are differently modifiedelectrico-magnetic phenomena, as yet unknown in their fundamental principles? Mr. Hunt finds that the undulatory theory does not account for the results ofhis experiments. Sir David Brewster, in his Treatise on Optics, showing that\"the colors of vegetable life arise . . . from a specific attraction which theparticles of these bodies exercise over the differently-colored rays of light,\"and that \"it is by the light of the sun that the colored juices of plants areelaborated, that the colors of bodies are changed, etc. . . .\" remarks that itis not easy to allow \"that such effects can be produced by the mere vibration ofan ethereal medium.\" And he is forced, he says, \"by this class of facts, toreason as if light was material (?).\" Professor Josiah P. Cooke, of HarvardUniversity, says that he \"cannot agree . . . with those who regard thewave-theory of light as an established principle of science.\" * Herschel'sdoctrine, that the intensity of light, in effect of each undulation, \"isinversely as the square of the distance from the luminous body,\" if correct,damages a good deal if it does not kill the undulatory theory. That he is right,was proved repeatedly by experiments with photometers; and, though it begins tobe much doubted, the undulatory theory is still alive. As General Pleasonton, of Philadelphia, has undertaken to combat thisanti-Pythagorean hypothesis, and has devoted to it a whole volume, we cannot doany better than refer the reader to his recent work on the Blue Ray, etc. Weleave the theory of Thomas Young, who, according to Tyndall, \"placed on animmovable basis the undulatory theory of light,\" to hold its own if it can, withthe Philadelphia experimenter. Eliphas Levi, the modern magician, describes the astral light in the followingsentence: \"We have said that to acquire magical power, two things are necessary:to disengage the will from all servitude, and to exercise it in control.\" \"The sovereign will is represented in our symbols by the woman who crushes theserpent's head, and by the resplendent angel who represses the dragon, and holdshim under his foot and spear; the great magical agent, the dual current oflight, the living and astral fire of the earth, has been represented in theancient theogonies by the serpent with the head of a bull, a ram, or a dog. Itis the double serpent of the caduceus, it is the Old Serpent of the Genesis, butit is also the brazen serpent of Moses entwined around the tau, that is to say,the generative lingha. It is also the goat of the witch-sabbath, and theBaphomet of the Templars; it is the Hyle of the Gnostics; it is the double-tailof serpent which forms the legs of the solar cock of the Abraxas; finally, it isthe Devil of M. Eudes de Mirville. But in very fact it is the blind force whichsouls have to conquer to liberate themselves from the bonds of the earth; for iftheir will does not free \"them from this fatal attraction, they will be absorbedin the current by the force which has produced them, and will return to thecentral and eternal fire.\" This last kabalistic figure of speech, notwithstanding its strange phraseology,is precisely the one used by Jesus; and in his mind it could have had no othersignificance than the one attributed to it by the Gnostics and the Kabalists.Later the Christian theologians interpreted it differently, and with them itbecame the doctrine of Hell. Literally, though, it simply means what itsays--the astral light, or the generator and destroyer of all forms. \"All the magical operations,\" continues Levi, \"consist in freeing one's selffrom the coils of the Ancient Serpent; then to place the foot on its head, andlead it according to the operator's will. 'I will give unto thee,' says theSerpent, in the Gospel myth, 'all the kingdoms of the earth, if thou wilt falldown and worship me.' The initiate should reply to him, 'I will not fall down,but thou shalt crouch at my feet; thou wilt give me nothing, but I will make useof thee and take whatever I wish. For I am thy Lord and Master!' This is thereal meaning of the ambiguous response made by Jesus to the tempter. . . . Thus,the Devil is not an Entity. It is an errant force, as the name signifies. Anodic or magnetic current formed by a chain (a circle) of pernicious wills mustcreate this evil spirit which the Gospel calls legion, and which forces into thesea a herd of swine--another evangelical allegory showing how base natures canbe driven headlong by the blind forces set in motion by error and sin.\" * In his extensive work on the mystical manifestations of human nature, the Germannaturalist and philosopher, Maximilian Perty, has devoted a whole chapter to theModern Forms of Magic. \"The manifestations of magical life,\" he says in hisPreface, \"partially repose on quite another order of things than the nature inwhich we are acquainted with time, space, and causality; these manifestationscan be experimented with but little; they cannot be called out at our bidding,but may be observed and carefully followed whenever they occur in our presence;we can only group them by analogy under certain divisions, and deduce from themgeneral principles and laws.\" Thus, for Professor Perty, who evidently belongsto the school of Schopenhauer, the possibility and naturalness of the phenomenawhich took place in the presence of Kavindasami, the fakir, and are described byLouis Jacolliot, the Orientalist, are fully demonstrated on that principle. Thefakir was a man who, through the entire subjugation of the matter of hiscorporeal system has attained to that state of purification at which the spiritbecomes nearly freed from its prison, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu004.htm#fn_205] and can produce wonders.His will, nay, a simple desire of his has become creative force, and he cancommand the elements and powers of nature. His body is no more an impediment tohim; hence he can converse \"spirit to spirit, breath to breath.\" Under hisextended palms, a seed, unknown to him (for Jacolliot has chosen it at randomamong a variety of seeds, from a bag, and planted it himself, after marking it,in a flower pot), will germinate instantly, and push its way through the soil.Developing in less than two hours' time to a size and height which, perhaps,under ordinary circumstances, would require several days or weeks, it growsmiraculously under the very eyes of the perplexed experimenter, and mockinglyupsets every accepted formula in Botany. Is this a miracle? By no means; it maybe one, perhaps, if we take Webster's definition, that a miracle is \"every eventcontrary to the established constitution and course of things--a deviation fromthe known laws of nature.\" But are our naturalists prepared to support the claimthat what they have once established on observation is infallible? Or that everylaw of nature is known to them? In this instance, the \"miracle\" is but a littlemore prominent than the now well-known experiments of General Pleasonton, ofPhiladelphia. While the vegetation and fruitage of his vines were stimulated toan incredible activity by the artificial violet light, the magnetic fluidemanating from the hands of the fakir effected still more intense and rapidchanges in the vital function of the Indian plants. It attracted andconcentrated the akasa, or life-principle, on the germ. ** His magnetism,obeying his will, drew up the akasa in a concentrated current through the planttowards his hands, and by keeping up an unintermitted flow for the requisitespace of time, the life-principle of the plant built up cell after cell, layerafter layer, with preternatural activity, until the work was done. Thelife-principle is but a blind force obeying a controlling influence. In theordinary course of nature the plant-protoplasm would have concentrated anddirected it at a certain established rate. This rate would have been controlledby the prevalent atmospheric conditions; its growth being rapid or slow, and, instalk or head, in proportion to the amount of light, heat, and moisture of theseason. But the fakir, coming to the help of nature with his powerful will andspirit purified from the contact with matter, * condenses, so to speak, theessence of plant-life into its germ, and forces it to maturity ahead of itstime. This blind force being totally submissive to his will, obeys it withservility. If he chose to imagine the plant as a monster, it would as surelybecome such, as ordinarily it would grow in its natural shape; for the concreteimage--slave to the subjective model outlined in the imagination of thefakir--is forced to follow the original in its least detail, as the hand andbrush of the painter follow the image which they copy from his mind. The will ofthe fakir-conjurer forms an invisible but yet, to it, perfectly objectivematrix, in which the vegetable matter is caused to deposit itself and assume thefixed shape. The will creates; for the will in motion is force, and forceproduces matter. If some persons object to the explanation on the ground that the fakir could byno means create the model in his imagination, since he was kept ignorant byJacolliot of the kind of seed he had selected for the experiment; to these wewill answer that the spirit of man is like that of his Creator--omniscient inits essence. While in his natural state the fakir did not, and could not knowwhether it was a melon-seed, or seed of any other plant; once entranced, i.e.,bodily dead to all outward appearance--the spirit, for which there exist neitherdistance, material obstacle, nor space of time, experienced no difficulty inperceiving the melon-seed, whether as it lay deeply buried in the mud of theflower-pot, or reflected in the faithful picture-gallery of Jacolliot's brain.Our visions, portents, and other psychological phenomena, all of which exist innature, are corroborative of the above fact. And now, perhaps, we might as well meet at once another impending objection.Indian jugglers, they will tell us, do the same, and as well as the fakir, if wecan believe newspapers and travellers' narratives. Undoubtedly so; and moreoverthese strolling jugglers are neither pure in their modes of living norconsidered holy by any one; neither by foreigners nor their own people. They aregenerally FEARED and despised by the natives, for they are sorcerers; menpractising the black art. While such a holy man as Kavindasami requires but thehelp of his own divine soul, closely united with the astral spirit, and the helpof a few familiar pitris--pure, ethereal beings, who rally around their electbrother in flesh--the sorcerer can summon to his help but that class of spiritswhich we know as the elementals. Like attracts like; and greed for money, impurepurposes, and selfish views, cannot attract any other spirits than those thatthe Hebrew kabalists know as the klippoth, dwellers of Asiah, the fourth world,and the Eastern magicians as the afrits, or elementary spirits of error, or thedevs. This is how an English paper describes the astounding trick of plant-growth, asperformed by Indian jugglers: \"An empty flower-pot was now placed upon the floor by the juggler, who requestedthat his comrades might be allowed to bring up some garden mould from the littleplot of ground below. Permission being accorded, the man went, and in twominutes returned with a small quantity of fresh earth tied up in a corner of hischudder, which was deposited in the flower-pot and lightly pressed down. Takingfrom his basket a dry mango-stone, and handing it round to the company that theymight examine it, and satisfy themselves that it was really what it seemed tobe, the juggler scooped out a little earth from the centre of the flower-pot andplaced the stone in the cavity. He then turned the earth lightly over it, and,having poured a little water over the surface, shut the flower-pot out of viewby means of a sheet thrown over a small triangle. And now, amid a full chorus ofvoices and rat-tat-tat accompaniment of the tabor, the stone germinated;presently a section of the cloth was drawn aside, and gave to view the tendershoot, characterized by two long leaves of a blackish-brown color. The cloth wasreadjusted, and the incantation resumed. Not long was it, however, before thecloth was a second time drawn aside, and it was then seen that the two firstleaves had given place to several green ones, and that the plant now stood nineor ten inches high. A third time, and the foliage was much thicker, the saplingbeing about thirteen to fourteen inches in height. A fourth time, and the littleminiature tree, now about eighteen inches in height, had ten or twelve mangoesabout the size of walnuts hanging about its branches. Finally, after the lapseof three or four minutes, the cloth was altogether removed, and the fruit,having the perfection of size, though not of maturity, was plucked and handed tothe spectators, and, on being tasted, was found to be approaching ripeness,being sweetly acid.\" We may add to this, that we have witnessed the same experiment in India andThibet, and that more than once we provided the flower-pot ourselves, byemptying an old tin box of some Liebig extracts. We filled it with earth withour own hands, and planted in it a small root handed to us by the conjurer, anduntil the experiment was ended never once removed our eyes from the pot, whichwas placed in our own room. The result was invariably the same as abovedescribed. Does the reader imagine that any prestidigitator could produce thesame manifestation under the same conditions? The learned Orioli, Corresponding Member of the Institute of France, gives anumber of instances which show the marvellous effects produced by the will-poweracting upon the invisible Proteus of the mesmerists. \"I have seen,\" says he,\"certain persons, who simply by pronouncing certain words, arrest wild bulls andhorses at headlong speed, and suspend in its flight the arrow which cleaves theair.\" Thomas Bartholini affirms the same. Says Du Potet: \"When I trace upon the floor with chalk or charcoal this figure .. . a fire, a light fixes itself on it. Soon it attracts to itself the personwho approaches it: it detains and fascinates him . . . and it is useless for himto try to cross the line. A magic power compels him to stand still. At the endof a few moments he yields, uttering sobs. . . . The cause is not in me, it isin this entirely kabalistic sign; in vain would you employ violence.\" * In a series of remarkable experiments made by Regazzoni in the presence ofcertain well-known French physicians, at Paris, on the 18th of May, 1856, theyassembled on one night together, and Regazzoni, with his finger, traced animaginary kabalistic line upon the floor, over which he made a few rapid passes.It was agreed that the mesmeric subjects, selected by the investigators and thecommittee for the experiments, and all strangers to him, should be broughtblindfold into the room, and caused to walk toward the line, without a wordbeing spoken to indicate what was expected of them. The subjects moved alongunsuspiciously till they came to the invisible barrier, when, as it isdescribed, \"their feet, as if they had been suddenly seized and riveted, adhereto the ground, while their bodies, carried forward by the rapid impulse of themotion, fall and strike the floor. The sudden rigidity of their limbs was likethat of a frozen corpse, and their heels were rooted with mathematical precisionupon the fatal line!\" * In another experiment it was agreed that upon one of the physicians giving acertain signal by a glance of the eye, the blindfolded girl should be made tofall on the ground, as if struck by lightning, by the magnetic fluid emitted byRegazzoni's will. She was placed at a distance from the magnetizer; the signalwas given, and instantly the subject was felled to the earth, without a wordbeing spoken or a gesture made. Involuntarily one of the spectators stretchedout his hand as if to catch her; but Regazzoni, in a voice of thunder,exclaimed, \"Do not touch her! Let her fall; a magnetized subject is never hurtby falling.\" Des Mousseaux, who tells the story, says that \"marble is not morerigid than was her body; her head did not touch the ground; one of her armsremained stretched in the air; one of her legs was raised and the otherhorizontal. She remained in this unnatural posture an indefinite time. Lessrigid is a statue of bronze.\" ** All the effects witnessed in the experiments of public lecturers upon mesmerism,were produced by Regazzoni in perfection, and without one spoken word toindicate what the subject was to do. He even by his silent will produced themost surprising effects upon the physical systems of persons totally unknown tohim. Directions whispered by the committee in Regazzoni's ear were immediatelyobeyed by the subjects, whose ears were stuffed with cotton, and whose eyes werebandaged. Nay, in some cases it was not even necessary for them to express tothe magnetizer what they desired, for their own mental requests were compliedwith with perfect fidelity. Experiments of a similar character were made by Regazzoni in England, at adistance of three hundred paces from the subject brought to him. The jettatura,or evil eye, is nothing but the direction of this invisible fluid, charged withmalicious will and hatred, from one person to another, and sent out with theintention of harming him. It may equally be employed for a good or evil purpose.In the former case it is magic; in the latter, sorcery. What is the WILL? Can \"exact science\" tell? What is the nature of thatintelligent, intangible, and powerful something which reigns supreme over allinert matter? The great Universal Idea willed, and the cosmos sprang intoexistence. I will, and my limbs obey. I will, and, my thought traversing space,which does not exist for it, envelops the body of another individual who is nota part of myself, penetrates through his pores, and, superseding his ownfaculties, if they are weaker, forces him to a predetermined action. It actslike the fluid of a galvanic battery on the limbs of a corpse. The mysteriouseffects of attraction and repulsion are the unconscious agents of that will;fascination, such as we see exercised by some animals, by serpents over birds,for instance, is a conscious action of it, and the result of thought.Sealing-wax, glass, and amber, when rubbed, i.e., when the latent heat whichexists in every substance is awakened, attract light bodies; they exerciseunconsciously, will; for inorganic as well as organic matter possesses aparticle of the divine essence in itself, however infinitesimally small it maybe. And how could it be otherwise? Notwithstanding that in the progress of itsevolution it may from beginning to end have passed through millions of variousforms, it must ever retain its germ-point of that preexistent matter, which isthe first manifestation and emanation of the Deity itself. What is then thisinexplicable power of attraction but an atomical portion of that essence thatscientists and kabalists equally recognize as the \"principle of life\"--theakasa? Granted that the attraction exercised by such bodies may be blind; but aswe ascend higher the scale of the organic beings in nature, we find thisprinciple of life developing attributes and faculties which become moredetermined and marked with every rung of the endless ladder. Man, the mostperfect of organized beings on earth, in whom matter and spirit--i.e., will--arethe most developed and powerful, is alone allowed to give a conscious impulse tothat principle which emanates from him; and only he can impart to the magneticfluid opposite and various impulses without limit as to the direction. \"Hewills,\" says Du Potet, \"and organized matter obeys. It has no poles.\" Dr. Brierre de Boismont, in his volume on Hallucinations, reviews a wonderfulvariety of visions, apparitions, and ecstasies, generally termed hallucinations.\"We cannot deny,\" he says, \"that in certain diseases we see developed a greatsurexcitation of sensibility, which lends to the senses a prodigious acutenessof perception. Thus, some individuals will perceive at considerable distances,others will announce the approach of persons who are really on their way,although those present can neither hear nor see them coming.\" * A lucid patient, lying in his bed, announces the arrival of persons to see whomhe must possess transmural vision, and this faculty is termed by Brierre deBoismont--hallucination. In our ignorance, we have hitherto innocently supposedthat in order to be rightly termed a hallucination, a vision must be subjective.It must have an existence only in the delirious brain of the patient. But if thelatter announces the visit of a person, miles away, and this person arrives atthe very moment predicted by the seer, then his vision was no more subjective,but on the contrary perfectly objective, for he saw that person in the act ofcoming. And how could the patient see, through solid bodies and space, an objectshut out from the reach of our mortal sight, if he had not exercised hisspiritual eyes on that occasion? Coincidence? Cabanis speaks of certain nervous disorders in which the patients easilydistinguished with the naked eye infusoria and other microscopical beings whichothers could only perceive through powerful lenses. \"I have met subjects,\" hesays, \"who saw in Cimmerian darkness as well as in a lighted room; . . .\" others\"who followed persons, tracing them out like dogs, and recognizing by the smellobjects belonging to such persons or even such as had been only touched by them,with a sagacity which was hitherto observed only in animals.\" ** Exactly; because reason, which, as Cabanis says, develops only at the expenseand loss of natural instinct, is a Chinese wall slowly rising on the soil ofsophistry, and which finally shuts out man's spiritual perceptions of which theinstinct is one of the most important examples. Arrived at certain stages ofphysical prostration, when mind and the reasoning faculties seem paralyzedthrough weakness and bodily exhaustion, instinct--the spiritual unity of thefive senses--sees, hears, feels, tastes, and smells, unimpaired by either timeor space. What do we know of the exact limits of mental action? How can aphysician take upon himself to distinguish the imaginary from the real senses ina man who may be living a spiritual life, in a body so exhausted of its usualvitality that it actually is unable to prevent the soul from oozing out from itsprison? The divine light through which, unimpeded by matter, the soul perceives thingspast, present, and to come, as though their rays were focused in a mirror; thedeath-dealing bolt projected in an instant of fierce anger or at the climax oflong-festering hate; the blessing wafted from a grateful or benevolent heart;and the curse hurled at an object--offender or victim--all have to pass throughthat universal agent, which under one impulse is the breath of God, and underanother--the venom of the devil. It was discovered (?) by Baron Reichenbach andcalled OD, whether intentionally or otherwise we cannot say, but it is singularthat a name should have been chosen which is mentioned in the most ancient booksof the Kabala. Our readers will certainly inquire what then is this invisible all? How is itthat our scientific methods, however perfected, have never discovered any of themagical properties contained in it? To this we can answer, that it is no reasonbecause modern scientists are ignorant of them that it should not possess allthe properties with which the ancient philosophers endowed it. Science rejectsmany a thing to-day which she may find herself forced to accept to-morrow. Alittle less than a century ago the Academy denied Franklin's electricity, and,at the present day, we can hardly find a house without a conductor on its roof.Shooting at the barn-door, the Academy missed the barn itself. Modernscientists, by their wilful skepticism and learned ignorance, do this veryfrequently. Emepht, the supreme, first principle, produced an egg; by brooding over which,and permeating the substance of it with its own vivifying essence, the germcontained within was developed; and Phtha, the active creative principleproceeded from it, and began his work. From the boundless expanse of cosmicmatter, which had formed itself under his breath, or will, this cosmicmatter--astral light, aether, fire-mist, principle of life--it matters not howwe may call it, this creative principle, or, as our modern philosophy terms it,law of evolution, by setting in motion the potencies latent in it, formed sunsand stars, and satellites; controlled their emplacement by the immutable law ofharmony, and peopled them \"with every form and quality of life.\" In the ancientEastern mythologies, the cosmogonic myth states that there was but water (thefather) and the prolific slime (the mother, Ilus or Hyle), from which creptforth the mundane snake-matter. It was the god Phanes, the revealed one, theWord, or logos. How willingly this myth was accepted, even by the Christians whocompiled the New Testament, may be easily inferred from the following fact:Phanes, the revealed god, is represented in this snake-symbol as a protogonos, abeing furnished with the heads of a man, a hawk or an eagle, a bull--taurus, anda lion, with wings on both sides. The heads relate to the zodiac, and typify thefour seasons of the year, for the mundane serpent is the mundane year, while theserpent itself is the symbol of Kneph, the hidden, or unrevealed deity--God theFather. Time is winged, therefore the serpent is represented with wings. If weremember that each of the four evangelists is represented as having near him oneof the described animals--grouped together in Solomon's triangle in the pentacleof Ezekiel, and to be found in the four cherubs or sphinxes of the sacredarch--we will perhaps understand the secret meaning, as well as the reason whythe early Christians adopted this symbol; and how it is that the present RomanCatholics and the Greeks of the Oriental Church still represent these animals inthe pictures of their evangelists which sometimes accompany the four Gospels. Wewill also understand why Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, had so insisted upon thenecessity of the fourth gospel; giving as a reason that there could not be lessthan four of them, as there were four zones in the world, and four principalwinds coming from the four cardinal points, etc. * According to one of the Egyptian myths, the phantom-form of the isle of Chemmis(Chemi, ancient Egypt), which floats on the ethereal waves of the empyreansphere, was called into being by Horus-Apollo, the sun-god, who caused it toevolve out of the mundane egg. In the cosmogonical poem of Voluspa (the song of the prophetess), which containsthe Scandinavian legends of the very dawn of ages, the phantom-germ of theuniverse is represented as lying in the Ginnungagap--or the cup of illusion, aboundless and void abyss. In this world's matrix, formerly a region of night anddesolation, Nebelheim (the Mist-place) dropped a ray of cold light (aether),which overflowed this cup and froze in it. Then the Invisible blew a scorchingwind which dissolved the frozen waters and cleared the mist. These waters,called the streams of Elivagar, distilled in vivifying drops which, fallingdown, created the earth and the giant Ymir, who only had \"the semblance of man\"(male principle). With him was created the cow, Audhumla ** (female principle),from whose udder flowed four streams of milk, *** which diffused themselvesthroughout space (the astral light in its purest emanation). The cow Audhumlaproduces a superior being, called Bur, handsome and powerful, by licking thestones that were covered with mineral salt. Now, if we take into consideration that this mineral was universally regarded byancient philosophers as one of the chief formative principles in organiccreation; by the alchemists as the universal menstruum, which, they said, was tobe wrought from water; and by every one else, even as it is regarded now byscience as well as in the popular ideas, to be an indispensable ingredient forman and beast; we may readily comprehend the hidden wisdom of this allegory ofthe creation of man. Paracelsus calls salt \"the centre of water, wherein metalsought to die,\" etc., and Van Helmont terms the Alkahest, \"summum et felicissimumomnium salium,\" the most successful of all salts. In the Gospel according to Matthew, Jesus says: \"Ye are the salt of the earth:but if the salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted?\" andfollowing the parable he adds: \"Ye are the light of the world\" (v. 14). This ismore than an allegory; these words point to a direct and unequivocal meaning inrelation to the spiritual and physical organisms of man in his dual nature, andshow, moreover, a knowledge of the \"secret doctrine,\" the direct traces of whichwe find equally in the oldest ancient and current popular traditions, in boththe Old and New Testaments, and in the writings of the ancient and mediaevalmystics and philosophers. But to return to our Edda-legend. Ymir, the giant, falls asleep, and sweatsprofusely. This perspiration causes the pit of his left arm to generate out ofthat place a man and a woman, while his foot produces a son for them. Thus,while the mythic \"cow\" gives being to a race of superior spiritual men, thegiant Ymir begets a race of evil and depraved men, the Hrimthursen, orfrost-giants. Comparing notes with the Hindu Vedas, we find it then, with slightmodifications, the same cosmogonic legend in substance and details. Brahma, assoon as Bhagaveda, the Supreme God, endows him with creative powers, producesanimated beings, wholly spiritual at first. The Dejotas, inhabitants of theSurg's (the celestial) region, are unfit to live on earth, therefore Brahmacreates the Daints (giants, who become the dwellers of the Patals, the lowerregions of space), who are also unfit to inhabit Mirtlok (the earth). Topalliate the evil, the creative power evolves from his mouth the first Brahman,who thus becomes the progenitor of our race; from his right arm Brahma createsRaettris, the warrior, and from his left Shaterany, the wife of Raettris. Thentheir son Bais springs from the right foot of the creator, and his wife Basanyfrom the left. While in the Scandinavian legend Bur (the son of the cowAudhumla), a superior being, marries Besla, a daughter of the depraved race ofgiants, in the Hindu tradition the first Brahman marries Daintary, also adaughter of the race of the giants; and in Genesis we see the sons of God takingfor wives the daughters of men, and likewise producing mighty men of old; thewhole establishing an unquestionable identity of origin between the Christianinspired Book, and the heathen \"fables\" of Scandinavia and Hindustan. Thetraditions of nearly every other nation, if examined, will yield a like result. What modern cosmogonist could compress within so simple a symbol as the Egyptianserpent in a circle such a world of meaning? Here we have, in this creature, thewhole philosophy of the universe: matter vivified by spirit, and the twoconjointly evolving out of chaos (Force) everything that was to be. To signifythat the elements are fast bound in this cosmic matter, which the serpentsymbolizes, the Egyptians tied its tail into a knot. There is one more important emblem connected with the sloughing of the serpent'sskin, which, so far as we are aware, has never been heretofore noticed by oursymbolists. As the reptile upon casting his coat becomes freed from a casing ofgross matter, which cramped a body grown too large for it, and resumes itsexistence with renewed activity, so man, by casting off the gross material body,enters upon the next stage of his existence with enlarged powers and quickenedvitality. Inversely, the Chaldean Kabalists tell us that primeval man, who,contrary to the Darwinian theory was purer, wiser, and far more spiritual, asshown by the myths of the Scandinavian Bur, the Hindu Dejotas, and the Mosaic\"sons of God,\"--in short, of a far higher nature than the man of the presentAdamic race, became despiritualized or tainted with matter, and then, for thefirst time, was given the fleshly body, which is typified in Genesis in thatprofoundly-significant verse: \"Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord Godmake coats of skin, and clothed them.\" * Unless the commentators would make ofthe First Cause a celestial tailor, what else can the apparently absurd wordsmean, but that the spiritual man had reached, through the progress ofinvolution, to that point where matter, predominating over and conqueringspirit, had transformed him into the physical man, or the second Adam, of thesecond chapter of Genesis? This kabalistical doctrine is much more elaborated in the Book of Jasher. ** Inchapter vii., these garments of skin are taken by Noah into the ark, he havingobtained them by inheritance from Methuselah and Enoch, who had them from Adamand his wife. Ham steals them from his father Noah; gives them \"in secret\" toCush, who conceals them from his sons and brothers, and passes them to Nimrod. While some Kabalists, and even archeologists say that \"Adam, Enoch, and Noahmight, in outward appearance, be different men, but they were really theselfsame divine person.\" * Others explain that between Adam and Noah thereintervened several cycles. That is to say, that every one of the antediluvianpatriarchs stood as the representative of a race which had its place in asuccession of cycles; and each of which races was less spiritual than itspredecessor. Thus Noah, though a good man, could not have borne comparison withhis ancestor, Enoch, who \"walked with God and did not die.\" Hence theallegorical interpretation which makes Noah have this coat of skin byinheritance from the second Adam and Enoch, but not wear it himself, for ifotherwise, Ham could not have stolen it. But Noah and his children bridged theflood; and while the former belonged to the old and still spiritual antediluviangeneration, insomuch as he was selected from all mankind for his purity, hischildren were post-diluvian. The coat of skin worn by Cush \"in secret,\"--i.e.,when his spiritual nature began to be tainted by the material--is placed onNimrod, the most powerful and strongest of physical men on this side of theflood--the last remnant of the antediluvian giants. ** In the Scandinavian legend, Ymir, the giant, is slain by the sons of Bur, andthe streams of blood flowing from his wounds were so copious that the flooddrowned the whole race of ice and frost giants, and Bergelmir alone of that racewas saved, with his wife, by taking refuge in a bark; which fact permitted himto transmit a new branch of giants from the old stock. But all the sons of Burremained untouched by the flood. *** When the symbolism of this diluvian legend is unravelled, one perceives at oncethe real meaning of the allegory. The giant Ymir typifies the primitive rudeorganic matter, the blind cosmical forces, in their chaotic state, before theyreceived the intelligent impulse of the Divine Spirit which set them into aregular motion dependent on immovable laws. The progeny of Bur are the \"sons ofGod,\" or the minor gods mentioned by Plato in the Timaeus, and who wereintrusted, as he expresses it, with the creation of men; for we see them takingthe mangled remains of Ymir to the Ginnunga-gap, the chaotic abyss, andemploying them for the creation of our world. His blood goes to form oceans andrivers; his bones, the mountains; his teeth, the rocks and cliffs; his hair, thetrees, etc.; while his skull forms the heavenly vault, supported by four pillarsrepresenting the four cardinal points. From the eye-brows of Ymir was createdthe future abode of man--Midgard. This abode (the earth), says the Edda, inorder to be correctly described in all its minute particulars, must be conceivedas round as a ring, or as a disk, floating in the midst of the Celestial Ocean(Ether). It is encircled by Yormungand, the gigantic Midgard or Earth Serpent,holding its tail in its mouth. This is the mundane snake, matter and spirit,combined product and emanation of Ymir, the gross rudimental matter, and of thespirit of the \"sons of God,\" who fashioned and created all forms. This emanationis the astral light of the Kabalists, and the as yet problematical, and hardlyknown, aether, or the \"hypothetical agent of great elasticity\" of ourphysicists. How sure the ancients were of this doctrine of man's trinitarian nature may beinferred from the same Scandinavian legend of the creation of mankind. Accordingto the Voluspa, Odin, Honir, and Lodur, who are the progenitors of our race,found in one of their walks on the ocean-beach, two sticks floating on thewaves, \"powerless and without destiny.\" Odin breathed in them the breath oflife; Honir endowed them with soul and motion; and Lodur with beauty, speech,sight, and hearing. The man they called Askr--the ash,* and the woman Embla--thealder. These first men are placed in Midgard (mid-garden, or Eden) and thusinherit, from their creators, matter or inorganic life; mind, or soul; and purespirit; the first corresponding to that part of their organism which sprung fromthe remains of Ymir, the giant-matter, the second from the &Ælig;sir, or gods,the descendants of Bur, and the third from the Vanr, or the representative ofpure spirit. Another version of the Edda makes our visible universe spring from beneath theluxuriant branches of the mundane tree--the Yggdrasill, the tree with the threeroots. Under the first root runs the fountain of life, Urdar; under the secondis the famous well of Mimer, in which lie deeply buried Wit and Wisdom. Odin,the Alfadir, asks for a draught of this water; he gets it, but finds himselfobliged to pledge one of his eyes for it; the eye being in this case the symbolof the Deity revealing itself in the wisdom of its own creation; for Odin leavesit at the bottom of the deep well. The care of the mundane tree is intrusted tothree maidens (the Norns or Parcae), Urdhr, Verdandi, and Skuld--or the Present,the Past, and the Future. Every morning, while fixing the term of human life,they draw water from the Urdar-fountain, and sprinkle with it the roots of themundane tree, that it may live. The exhalations of the ash, Yggdrasill,condense, and falling down upon our earth call into existence and change of formevery portion of the inanimate matter. This tree is the symbol of the universalLife, organic as well as inorganic; its emanations represent the spirit whichvivifies every form of creation; and of its three roots, one extends to heaven,the second to the dwelling of the magicians--giants, inhabitants of the loftymountains--and at the third, under which is the spring Hvergelmir, gnaws themonster Nidhogg, who constantly leads mankind into evil. The Thibetans have alsotheir mundane tree, and the legend is of an untold antiquity. With them it iscalled Zampun. The first of its three roots also extends to heaven, to the topof the highest mountains; the second passes down to the lower region; the thirdremains midway, and reaches the east. The mundane tree of the Hindus is theAswatha. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu004.htm#fn_222] Its branchesare the components of the visible world; and its leaves the Mantras of theVedas, symbols of the universe in its intellectual or moral character. Who can study carefully the ancient religious and cosmogonic myths withoutperceiving that this striking similitude of conceptions, in their exoteric formand esoteric spirit, is the result of no mere coincidence, but manifests aconcurrent design? It shows that already in those ages which are shut out fromour sight by the impenetrable mist of tradition, human religious thoughtdeveloped in uniform sympathy in every portion of the globe. Christians callthis adoration of nature in her most concealed verities--Pantheism. But if thelatter, which worships and reveals to us God in space in His only possibleobjective form--that of visible nature--perpetually reminds humanity of Him whocreated it, and a religion of theological dogmatism only serves to conceal Himthe more from our sight, which is the better adapted to the needs of mankind? Modern science insists upon the doctrine of evolution; so do human reason andthe \"secret doctrine,\" and the idea is corroborated by the ancient legends andmyths, and even by the Bible itself when it is read between the lines. We see aflower slowly developing from a bud, and the bud from its seed. But whence thelatter, with all its predetermined programme of physical transformation, and itsinvisible, therefore spiritual forces which gradually develop its form, color,and odor? The word evolution speaks for itself. The germ of the present humanrace must have preexisted in the parent of this race, as the seed, in which lieshidden the flower of next summer, was developed in the capsule of itsparent-flower; the parent may be but slightly different, but it still differsfrom its future progeny. The antediluvian ancestors of the present elephant andlizard were, perhaps, the mammoth and the plesiosaurus; why should not theprogenitors of our human race have been the \"giants\" of the Vedas, the Voluspa,and the Book of Genesis? While it is positively absurd to believe the\"transformation of species\" to have taken place according to some of the morematerialistic views of the evolutionists, it is but natural to think that eachgenus, beginning with the mollusks and ending with monkey-man, has modified fromits own primordial and distinctive form. Supposing that we concede that \"animalshave descended from at most only four or five progenitors\"; * and that even a larigueur \"all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth havedescended from some one primordial form\"; ** still no one but a stone-blindmaterialist, one utterly devoid of intuitiveness, can seriously expect to see\"in the distant future . . . psychology based on a new foundation, that of thenecessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.\" *** Physical man, as a product of evolution, may be left in the hands of the man ofexact science. None but he can throw light upon the physical origin of the race.But, we must positively deny the materialist the same privilege as to thequestion of man's psychical and spiritual evolution, for he and his highestfaculties cannot be proved on any conclusive evidence to be \"as much products ofevolution as the humblest plant or the lowest worm.\" **** Having said so much, we will now proceed to show the evolution-hypothesis of theold Brahmans, as embodied by them in the allegory of the mundane tree. TheHindus represent their mythical tree, which they call Aswatha, in a way whichdiffers from that of the Scandinavians. It is described by them as growing in areversed position, the branches extending downward and the roots upward; theformer typifying the external world of sense, i.e., the visible cosmicaluniverse, and the latter the invisible world of spirit, because the roots havetheir genesis in the heavenly regions where, from the world's creation, humanityhas placed its invisible deity. The creative energy having originated in theprimordial point, the religious symbols of every people are so manyillustrations of this metaphysical hypothesis expounded by Pythagoras, Plato,and other philosophers. \"These Chaldeans,\" says Philo, * \"were of opinion thatthe Kosmos, among the things that exist, is a single point, either being itselfGod (Theos) or that in it is God, comprehending the soul of all the things.\" The Egyptian Pyramid also symbolically represents this idea of the mundane tree.Its apex is the mystic link between heaven and earth, and stands for the root,while the base represents the spreading branches, extending to the four cardinalpoints of the universe of matter. It conveys the idea that all things had theirorigin in spirit--evolution having originally begun from above and proceededdownward, instead of the reverse, as taught in the Darwinian theory. In otherwords, there has been a gradual materialization of forms until a fixed ultimateof debasement is reached. This point is that at which the doctrine of modernevolution enters into the arena of speculative hypothesis. Arrived at thisperiod we will find it easier to understand Haeckel's Anthropogeny, which tracesthe pedigree of man \"from its protoplasmic root, sodden in the mud of seas whichexisted before the oldest of the fossiliferous rocks were deposited,\" accordingto Professor Huxley's exposition. We may believe man evolved \"by gradualmodification of a mammal of ape-like organization\" still easier when we rememberthat (though in a more condensed and less elegant, but still as comprehensible,phraseology) the same theory was said by Berosus to have been taught manythousands of years before his time by the man-fish Oannes or Dagon, thesemi-demon of Babylonia. ** We may add, as a fact of interest, that this ancienttheory of evolution is not only embalmed in allegory and legend, but alsodepicted upon the walls of certain temples in India, and, in a fragmentary form,has been found in those of Egypt and on the slabs of Nimroud and Nineveh,excavated by Layard. But what lies back of the Darwinian line of descent? So far as he is concernednothing but \"unverifiable hypotheses.\" For, as he puts it, he views all beings\"as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the firstbed of the Silurian system was deposited.\" *** He does not attempt to show uswho these \"few beings\" were. But it answers our purpose quite as well, for inthe admission of their existence at all, resort to the ancients forcorroboration and elaboration of the idea receives the stamp of scientificapprobation. With all the changes that our globe has passed through as regardstemperature, climate, soil, and--if we may be pardoned, in view of recentdevelopments--its electromagnetic condition, he would be bold indeed who daresay that anything in present science contradicts the ancient hypothesis ofante-Silurian man. The flint-axes first found by Boucher de Perthes, in thevalley of the Somme, prove that men must have existed at a period so remote asto be beyond calculation. If we believe Buchner, man must have lived even duringand before the glacial epoch, a subdivision of the quaternary or diluvial periodprobably extending very far back in it. But who can tell what the next discoveryhas in store for us? Now, if we have indisputable proof that man has existed so long as this, theremust have been wonderful modifications of his physical system, correspondingwith the changes of climate and atmosphere. Does not this seem to show byanalogy that, tracing backward, there may have been other modifications, whichfitted the most remote progenitors of the \"frost-giants\" to live evencontemporaneously with the Devonian fishes or the Silurian mollusks? True, theyleft no flint-hatchets behind them, nor any bones or cave-deposits; but, if theancients are correct, the races at that time were composed not only of giants,or \"mighty men of renown,\" but also of \"sons of God.\" If those who believe inthe evolution of spirit as firmly as the materialists believe in that of matterare charged with teaching \"unverifiable hypotheses,\" how readily can they retortupon their accusers by saying that, by their own confession, their physicalevolution is still \"an unverified, if not actually an unverifiablehypothesis.\" * The former have at least the inferential proof of legendary myth,the vast antiquity of which is admitted by both philologists and archaeologists;while their antagonists have nothing of a similar nature, unless they helpthemselves to a portion of the ancient picture-writings, and suppress the rest. It is more than fortunate that, while the works of some men of science--who havejustly won their great reputations--will flatly contradict our hypotheses, theresearches and labors of others not less eminent seem to fully confirm ourviews. In the recent work of Mr. Alfred R. Wallace, The GeographicalDistribution of Animals, we find the author seriously favoring the idea of \"someslow process of development\" of the present species from others which havepreceded them, his idea extending back over an innumerable series of cycles. Andif animals, why not animal man, preceded still farther back by a thoroughly\"spiritual\" one--a \"son of God\"? And now, we may once more return to the symbolology of the olden times, andtheir physico-religious myths. Before we close this work, we hope to demonstratemore or less successfully how closely the conceptions of the latter were alliedwith many of the achievements of modern science in physics and naturalphilosophy. Under the emblematical devices and peculiar phraseology of thepriesthood of old lie latent hints of sciences as yet undiscovered during thepresent cycle. Well acquainted as may be a scholar with the hieratic writing andhieroglyphical system of the Egyptians, he must first of all learn to sift theirrecords. He has to assure himself, compasses and rule in hand, that thepicture-writing he is examining fits, to a line, certain fixed geometricalfigures which are the hidden keys to such records, before he ventures on aninterpretation. But there are myths which speak for themselves. In this class we may include thedouble-sexed first creators, of every cosmogony. The Greek Zeus-Zen (aether),and Chthonia (the chaotic earth) and Metis (the water), his wives; Osiris andIsis-Latona--the former god representing also ether--the first emanation of theSupreme Deity, Amun, the primeval source of light; the goddess earth and wateragain; Mithras, * the rock-born god, the symbol of the male mundane-fire, or thepersonified primordial light, and Mithra, the fire-goddess, at once his motherand his wife; the pure element of fire (the active, or male principle) regardedas light and heat, in conjunction with earth and water, or matter (female orpassive elements of cosmical generation). Mithras is the son of Bordj, thePersian mundane mountain ** from which he flashes out as a radiant ray of light.Brahma, the fire-god, and his prolific consort; and the Hindu Unghi, therefulgent deity, from whose body issue a thousand streams of glory and seventongues of flame, and in whose honor the Sagniku Brahmans preserve to this day aperpetual fire; Siva, personated by the mundane mountain of the Hindus--the Meru(Himalaya). This terrific fire-god, who is said in the legend to have descendedfrom heaven, like the Jewish Jehovah, in a pillar of fire, and a dozen of otherarchaic, double-sexed deities, all loudly proclaim their hidden meaning. Andwhat can these dual myths mean but the physico-chemical principle of primordialcreation? The first revelation of the Supreme Cause in its triple manifestationof spirit, force, and matter; the divine correlation, at its startingpoint ofevolution, allegorized as the marriage of fire and water, products ofelectrifying spirit, union of the male active principle with the female passiveelement, which become the parents of their tellurian child, cosmic matter, theprima materia, whose spirit is ether, the ASTRAL LIGHT! Thus all the world-mountains and mundane eggs, the mundane trees, and themundane snakes and pillars, may be shown to embody scientifically demonstratedtruths of natural philosophy. All of these mountains contain, with very triflingvariations, the allegorically-expressed description of primal cosmogony; themundane trees, that of subsequent evolution of spirit and matter; the mundanesnakes and pillars, symbolical memorials of the various attributes of thisdouble evolution in its endless correlation of cosmic forces. Within themysterious recesses of the mountain--the matrix of the universe--the gods(powers) prepare the atomic germs of organic life, and at the same time thelife-drink, which, when tasted, awakens in man-matter the man-spirit. The soma,the sacrificial drink of the Hindus, is that sacred beverage. For, at thecreation of the prima materia, while the grossest portions of it were used forthe physical embryo-world, the more divine essence of it pervaded the universe,invisibly permeating and enclosing within its ethereal waves the newly-borninfant, developing and stimulating it to activity as it slowly evolved out ofthe eternal chaos. From the poetry of abstract conception, these mundane myths gradually passedinto the concrete images of cosmic symbols, as archaeology now finds them. Thesnake, which plays such a prominent part in the imagery of the ancients, wasdegraded by the absurd interpretation of the serpent of the Book of Genesis intoa synonym of Satan, the Prince of Darkness, whereas it is the most ingenious ofall the myths in its various symbolisms. For one, as agathodaimon, it is theemblem of the healing art and of the immortality of man. It encircles the imagesof most of the sanitary or hygienic gods. The cup of health, in the EgyptianMysteries, was entwined by serpents. As evil can only arise from an extreme ingood, the serpent, under some other aspects, became typical of matter; which,the more it recedes from its primal spiritual source, the more it becomessubject of evil. In the oldest Egyptian imagery, as in the cosmogonic allegoriesof Kneph, the mundane snake, when typifying matter, is usually represented ascontained within a circle; he lies straight across its equator, thus indicatingthat the universe of astral light, out of which the physical world evolved,while bounding the latter, is itself bound by Emepht, or the Supreme FirstCause. Phtha producing Ra, and the myriad forms to which he gives life, areshown as creeping out of the mundane egg, because it is the most familiar formof that in which is deposited and developed the germ of every living being. Whenthe serpent represents eternity and immortality, it encircles the world, bitingits tail, and thus offering no solution of continuity. It then becomes theastral light. The disciples of the school of Pherecydes taught that ether (Zeusor Zen) is the highest empyrean heaven, which encloses the supernal world, andits light (the astral) is the concentrated primordial element. Such is the origin of the serpent, metamorphosed in Christian ages into Satan.It is the Od, the Ob, and the Aour of Moses and the Kabalists. When in itspassive state, when it acts on those who are unwittingly drawn within itscurrent, the astral light is the Ob, or Python. Moses was determined toexterminate all those who, sensitive to its influence, allowed themselves tofall under the easy control of the vicious beings which move in the astral waveslike fish in the water; beings who surround us, and whom Bulwer-Lytton calls inZanoni \"the dwellers of the threshold.\" It becomes the Od, as soon as it isvivified by the conscious efflux of an immortal soul; for then the astralcurrents are acting under the guidance of either an adept, a pure spirit, or anable mesmerizer, who is pure himself and knows how to direct the blind forces.In such cases even a high Planetary Spirit, one of the class of beings that havenever been embodied (though there are many among these hierarchies who havelived on our earth), descends occasionally to our sphere, and purifying thesurrounding atmosphere enables the subject to see, and opens in him the springsof true divine prophecy. As to the term Aour, the word is used to designatecertain occult properties of the universal agent. It pertains more directly tothe domain of the alchemist, and is of no interest to the general public. The author of the Homoiomerian system of philosophy, Anaxagoras of Clazomene,firmly believed that the spiritual prototypes of all things, as well as theirelements, were to be found in the boundless ether, where they were generated,whence they evolved, and whither they returned from earth. In common with theHindus who had personified their Akas'a (sky or ether) and made of it a deificentity, the Greeks and Latins had deified Æther. Virgil calls Zeus, pateromnipotens aether; * Magnus, the great god, Ether. These beings above alluded to are the elemental spirits of the Kabalists, **whom the Christian clergy denounce as \"devils,\" the enemies of mankind.\"AlreadyTertullian,\" gravely remarks Des Mousseaux, in his chapter on the devils, \"hasformally discovered the secret of their cunning.\" A priceless discovery, that. And now that we have learned so much of the mentallabors of the holy fathers and their achievements in astral anthropology, needwe be surprised at all, if, in the zeal of their spiritual explorations, theyhave so far neglected their own planet as at times to deny not only its right tomotion but even its sphericity? And this is what we find in Langhorne, the translator of Plutarch: Dionysius ofHalicarnassus [L. ii.] is of opinion that Numa built the temple of Vesta in around form, to represent the figure of the earth, for by Vesta they meant theearth.\" Moreover Philolaus, in common with all other Pythagoreans, held that theelement of fire was placed in the centre of the universe; and Plutarch, speakingon the subject, remarks of the Pythagoreans that \"the earth they suppose not tobe without motion, nor situated in the centre of the world, but to make itsrevolution round the sphere of fire, being neither one of the most valuable, norprincipal parts of the great machine.\" Plato, too, is reported to have been ofthe same opinion. It appears, therefore, that the Pythagoreans anticipatedGalileo's discovery. The existence of such an invisible universe being once admitted--as seems likelyto be the fact if the speculations of the authors of the Unseen Universe areever accepted by their colleagues--many of the phenomena, hitherto mysteriousand inexplicable, become plain. It acts on the organism of the magnetizedmediums, it penetrates and saturates them through and through, either directedby the powerful will of a mesmerizer, or by unseen beings who achieve the sameresult. Once that the silent operation is performed, the astral or siderealphantom of the mesmerized subject quits its paralyzed, earthly casket, and,after having roamed in the boundless space, alights at the threshold of themysterious \"bourne.\" For it, the gates of the portal which marks the entrance tothe \"silent land,\" are now but partially ajar; they will fly wide open beforethe soul of the entranced somnambulist only on that day when, united with itshigher immortal essence, it will have quitted forever its mortal frame. Untilthen, the seer or seeress can look but through a chink; it depends on theacuteness of the clairvoyant's spiritual sight to see more or less through it. The trinity in unity is an idea which all the ancient nations held in common.The three Dejotas--the Hindu Trimurti; the Three Heads of the Jewish Kabala. *\"Three heads are hewn in one another and over one another.\" The trinity of theEgyptians and that of the mythological Greeks were alike representations of thefirst triple emanation containing two male and one female principles. It is theunion of the male Logos, or wisdom, the revealed Deity, with the female Aura orAnima Mundi--\"the holy Pneuma,\" which is the Sephira of the Kabalists and theSophia of the refined Gnostics--that produced all things visible and invisible.While the true metaphysical interpretation of this universal dogma remainedwithin the sanctuaries, the Greeks, with their poetical instincts, impersonatedit in many charming myths. In the Dionysiacs of Nonnus, the god Bacchus, amongother allegories, is represented as in love with the soft, genial breeze (theHoly Pneuma), under the name of Aura Placida. ** And now we will leave GodfreyHiggins to speak: \"When the ignorant Fathers were constructing their calendar,they made out of this gentle zephyr two Roman Catholic saints!! \" SS. Aura andPlacida;--nay, they even went so far as to transfer the jolly god into St.Bacchus, and actually show his coffin and relics at Rome. The festival of thetwo \"blessed saints,\" Aura and Placida, occurs on the 5th of October, close tothe festival of St. Bacchus. *** How far more poetical, and how much greater the religious spirit to be found inthe \"heathen\" Norse legends of creation! In the boundless abyss of the mundanepit, the Ginnunga-gap, where rage in blind fury and conflict cosmic matter andthe primordial forces, suddenly blows the thaw-wind. It is the \"unrevealed God,\"who sends his beneficent breath from Muspellheim, the sphere of empyreal fire,within whose glowing rays dwells this great Being, far beyond the limits of theworld of matter; and the animus of the Unseen, the Spirit brooding over thedark, abysmal waters, calls order out of chaos, and once having given theimpulse to all creation the FIRST CAUSE retires, and remains for evermore instatu abscondito! **** There is both religion and science in these Scandinavian songs of heathendom. Asan example of the latter, take the conception of Thor, the son of Odin. Wheneverthis Hercules of the North would grasp the handle of his terrible weapon, thethunderbolt or electric hammer, he is obliged to put on his iron gantlets. Healso wears a magical belt known as the \"girdle of strength,\" which, whenevergirded about his person, greatly augments his celestial power. He rides upon acar drawn by two rams with silver bridles, and his awful brow is encircled by awreath of stars. His chariot has a pointed iron pole, and the spark-scatteringwheels continually roll over rumbling thunder-clouds. He hurls his hammer withresistless force against the rebellious frost-giants, whom he dissolves andannihilates. When he repairs to the Urdar fountain, where the gods meet inconclave to decide the destinies of humanity, he alone goes on foot, the rest ofthe deities being mounted. He walks, for fear that in crossing Bifrost (therainbow), the many-hued Æsirbridge, he might set it on fire with histhunder-car, at the same time causing the Urdar waters to boil. Rendered into plain English, how can this myth be interpreted but as showingthat the Norse legend-makers were thoroughly acquainted with electricity? Thor,the euhemerization of electricity, handles his peculiar element only whenprotected by gloves of iron, which is its natural conductor. His belt ofstrength is a closed circuit, around which the isolated current is compelled torun instead of diffusing itself through space. When he rushes with his carthrough the clouds, he is electricity in its active condition, as the sparksscattering from his wheels and the rumbling thunder of the clouds testify. Thepointed iron pole of the chariot is suggestive of the lightning-rod; the tworams which serve as his coursers are the familiar ancient symbols of the male orgenerative power; their silver bridles typify the female principle, for silveris the metal of Luna, Astarte, Diana. Therefore in the ram and his bridle we seecombined the active and passive principles of nature in opposition, one rushingforward, and the other restraining, while both are in subordination to theworld-permeating, electrical principle, which gives them their impulse. With theelectricity supplying the impulse, and the male and female principle combiningand recombining in endless correlation, the result is--evolution of visiblenature, the crown-glory of which is the planetary system, which in the mythicThor is allegorized by the circlet of glittering orbs which bedeck his brow.When in his active condition, his awful thunderbolts destroy everything, eventhe lesser other Titanic forces. But he goes afoot over the rainbow bridge,Bifrost, because to mingle with other less powerful gods than himself, he isobliged to be in a latent state, which he could not be in his car; otherwise hewould set on fire and annihilate all. The meaning of the Urdar-fountain, thatThor is afraid to make boil, and the cause of his reluctance, will only becomprehended by our physicists when the reciprocal electro-magnetic relations ofthe innumerable members of the planetary system, now just suspected, shall bethoroughly determined. Glimpses of the truth are given in the recent scientificessays of Professors Mayer and Sterry Hunt. The ancient philosophers believedthat not only volcanos, but boiling springs were caused by concentrations ofunderground electric currents, and that this same cause produced mineraldeposits of various natures, which form curative springs. If it be objected thatthis fact is not distinctly stated by the ancient authors, who, in the opinionof our century were hardly acquainted with electricity, we may simply answerthat not all the works embodying ancient wisdom are now extant among ourscientists. The clear and cool waters of Urdar were required for the dailyirrigation of the mystical mundane tree; and if they had been disturbed by Thor,or active electricity, they would have been converted into mineral springsunsuited for the purpose. Such examples as the above will support the ancientclaim of the philosophers that there is a logos in every mythos, or aground-work of truth in every fiction.

These pious and learned travellershave inadvertently come to our help. Dr. Caldwell, in his \"Comparative Grammarof the Dravidian Languages,\" p. 66, and Dr. Mateer, in the \"Land of Charity,\" p.83, fully support our assertions that the \"wise\" King Solomon got all hiskabalistic lore from India, as the above-given magical figure well shows. Theformer missionary is desirous to prove that very old and huge specimens of thebaobab-tree, which is not, as it appears, indigenous to India, but belongs tothe African soil, and \"found only at several ancient sites of foreign commerce(at Travancore), may, for aught we know,\" he adds, \"have been introduced intoIndia, and planted by the servants of King Solomon.\" The other proof is stillmore conclusive. Says Dr. Mateer, in his chapter on the Natural History ofTravancore: \"There is a curious fact connected with the name of this bird (thepeacock) which throws some light upon Scripture history. King Solomon sent hisnavy to Tarshish (I Kings, x. 22), which returned once in three years, bringing'gold and silver, ivory and apes, and peacocks.' Now the word used in the HebrewBible for peacock is 'tukki,' and as the Jews had, of course, no word for thesefine birds till they were first imported into Judea by King Solomon, there is nodoubt that 'tukki' is simply the old Tamil word 'toki,' the name of the peacock.The ape or monkey also is, in Hebrew, called 'koph,' the Indian word for whichis 'kaphi.' Ivory, we have seen, is abundant in South India, and gold is widelydistributed in the rivers of the western coast. Hence the 'Tarshish' referred towas doubtless the western coast of India, and Solomon's ships were ancient 'EastIndiamen.' \" And hence also we may add, besides \"the gold and silver, and apesand peacocks,\" King Solomon and his friend Hiram, of masonic renown, got their\"magic\" and \"wisdom\" from India. 137:* Cooke: \"New Chemistry,\" p. 22. 138:* Eliphas Levi: \"Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie.\" 139:* Plato hints at a ceremony used in the Mysteries during the performance ofwhich the neophyte was taught that men are in this life in a kind of prison, andtaught how to escape from it temporarily.

See Phaedo § 16, and commentaries on it byHenry More, the well-known Mystic philosopher and Platonist. 139:** The akasa is a Sanscrit word which means sky, but it also designates theimponderable and intangible life-principle--the astral and celestial lightscombined together, and which two form the anima mundi, and constitute the souland spirit of man; the celestial light forming his νουσ,πνευμα, or divinespirit, and the other his ψυχε, soul or astral spirit. The grosser particles ofthe latter enter into the fabrication of his outward form--the body. Akasa isthe mysterious fluid termed by scholastic science, \"the all-pervading ether\"; itenters into all the magical operations of nature, and produces mesmeric,magnetic, and spiritual phenomena. As, in Syria, Palestine, and India, meant thesky, life, and the sun at the same time; the sun being considered by the ancientsages as the great magnetic well of our universe. The softened pronunciation ofthis word was Ah--says Dunlap, for \"the s continually softens to h from Greeceto Calcutta.\" Ah is Iah, Ao, and Iao. God tells Moses that his name is \"I am\"(Ahiah), a reduplication of Ah or Iah. The word \"As\" Ah, or Iah means life,existence, and is evidently the root of the word akasa, which in Hindustan ispronounced ahasa, the life-principle, or Divine life-giving fluid or medium. Itis the Hebrew ruah, and means the \"wind,\" the breath, the air in motion, or\"moving spirit,\" according to Parkhurst's Lexicon; and is identical with thespirit of God moving on the face of the waters. 140:* Bear in mind that Kavindasami made Jacolliot swear that he would neitherapproach nor touch him during the time he was entranced.

But the Latin Church contradicts the Kabalists. St. Augustine has even adiscussion on that account with Porphyry, the Neo-platonist. \"These spirits,\" hesays, \"are deceitful, not by their nature, as Porphyry, the theurgist, will haveit, but through malice.

They work not by charms but bysimples.\"--(MS. Account of the Origin and Attributes of the True Rosicrucians.)ONE of the truest things ever said by a man of science is the remark made byProfessor Cooke in his New Chemistry. \"The history of Science shows that the agemust be prepared before scientific truths can take root and grow. The barrenpremonitions of science have been barren because these seeds of truth fell uponunfruitful soil; and, as soon as the fulness of the time has come, the seed hastaken root and the fruit has ripened . . . every student is surprised to findhow very little is the share of new truth which even the greatest genius hasadded to the previous stock.\" The revolution through which chemistry has recently passed, is well calculatedto concentrate the attention of chemists upon this fact; and it would not bestrange, if, in less time than it has required to effect it, the claims of thealchemists would be examined with impartiality, and studied from a rationalpoint of view. To bridge over the narrow gulf which now separates the newchemistry from old alchemy, is little, if any harder than what they have done ingoing from dualism to the law of Avogadro. As Ampere served to introduce Avogadro to our contemporary chemists, soReichenbach will perhaps one day be found to have paved the way with his OD forthe just appreciation of Paracelsus. It was more than fifty years beforemolecules were accepted as units of chemical calculations; it may require lessthan half that time to cause the superlative merits of the Swiss mystic to beacknowledged. The warning paragraph about healing mediums, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu005.htm#fn_239] which will be foundelsewhere, might have been written by one who had read his works. \"You mustunderstand,\" he says, \"that the magnet is that spirit of life in man which theinfected seeks, as both unite themselves with chaos from without. And thus thehealthy are infected by the unhealthy through magnetic attraction.\" The primal causes of the diseases afflicting mankind; the secret relationsbetween physiology and psychology, vainly tortured by men of modern science forsome clew to base their speculations upon; the specifics and remedies for everyailment of the human body--all are described and accounted for in his voluminousworks. Electro-magnetism, the so-called discovery of Professor Oersted, had beenused by Paracelsus three centuries before. This may be demonstrated by examiningcritically his mode of curing disease. Upon his achievements in chemistry thereis no need to enlarge, for it is admitted by fair and unprejudiced writers thathe was one of the greatest chemists of his time. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu005.htm#fn_240] Brierre de Boismont termshim a \"genius\" and agrees with Deleuze that he created a new epoch in thehistory of medicine. The secret of his successful and, as they were called,magic cures lies in his sovereign contempt for the so-called learned\"authorities\" of his age. \"Seeking for truth,\" says Paracelsus, \"I consideredwith myself that if there were no teachers of medicine in this world, how wouldI set to learn the art? No otherwise than in the great open book of nature,written with the finger of God. . . . I am accused and denounced for not havingentered in at the right door of art. But which is the right one? Galen,Avicenna, Mesue, Rhasis, or honest nature? I believe, the last! Through thisdoor I entered, and the light of nature, and no apothecary's lamp directed me onmy way.\" This utter scorn for established laws and scientific formulas, this aspirationof mortal clay to commingle with the spirit of nature, and look to it alone forhealth, and help, and the light of truth, was the cause of the inveterate hatredshown by the contemporary pigmies to the fire-philosopher and alchemist. Nowonder that he was accused of charlatanry and even drunkenness. Of the lattercharge, Hemmann boldly and fearlessly exonerates him, and proves that the foulaccusation proceeded from \"Oporinus, who lived with him some time in order tolearn his secrets, but his object was defeated; hence, the evil reports of hisdisciples and apothecaries.\" He was the founder of the School of AnimalMagnetism and the discoverer of the occult properties of the magnet. He wasbranded by his age as a sorcerer, because the cures he made were marvellous.Three centuries later, Baron Du Potet was also accused of sorcery anddemonolatry by the Church of Rome, and of charlatanry by the academicians ofEurope. As the fire-philosophers say, it is not the chemist who will condescendto look upon the \"living fire\" otherwise than his colleagues do. \"Thou hastforgotten what thy fathers taught thee about it--or rather, thou hast neverknown . . . it is too loud for thee!\" * A work upon magico-spiritual philosophy and occult science would be incompletewithout a particular notice of the history of animal magnetism, as it standssince Paracelsus staggered with it the schoolmen of the latter half of thesixteenth century. We will observe briefly its appearance in Paris when imported from Germany byAnton Mesmer. Let us peruse with care and caution the old papers now moulderingin the Academy of Sciences of that capital, for there we will find that, afterhaving rejected in its turn every discovery that was ever made since Galileo,the Immortals capped the climax by turning their backs upon magnetism andmesmerism. They voluntarily shut the doors before themselves, the doors whichled to those greatest mysteries of nature, which lie hid in the dark regions ofthe psychical as well as the physical world. The great universal solvent, theAlkahest, was within their reach--they passed it by; and now, after nearly ahundred years have elapsed, we read the following confession: \"Still it is true that, beyond the limits of direct observation, our science(chemistry) is not infallible, and our theories and systems, although they mayall contain a kernel of truth, undergo frequent changes, and are oftenrevolutionized.\" ** To assert so dogmatically that mesmerism and animal magnetism are buthallucinations, implies that it can be proved. But where are these proofs, whichalone ought to have authority in science? Thousands of times the chance wasgiven to the academicians to assure themselves of its truth; but, they haveinvariably declined. Vainly do mesmerists and healers invoke the testimony ofthe deaf, the lame, the diseased, the dying, who were cured or restored to lifeby simple manipulations and the apostolic \"laying on of hands.\" \"Coincidence\" isthe usual reply, when the fact is too evident to be absolutely denied;\"will-o'-the-wisp,\" \"exaggeration,\" \"quackery,\" are favorite expressions, withour but too numerous Thomases. Newton, the well-known American healer, hasperformed more instantaneous cures than many a famous physician of New York Cityhas had patients in all his life; Jacob, the Zouave, has had a like success inFrance. Must we then consider the accumulated testimony of the last forty yearsupon this subject to be all illusion, confederacy with clever charlatans, andlunacy? Even to breathe such a stupendous fallacy would be equivalent to aself-accusation of lunacy. Notwithstanding the recent sentence of Leymarie, the scoffs of the skeptics andof a vast majority of physicians and scientists, the unpopularity of thesubject, and, above all, the indefatigable persecutions of the Roman Catholicclergy, fighting in mesmerism woman's traditional enemy, so evident andunconquerable is the truth of its phenomena that even the French magistraturewas forced tacitly, though very reluctantly, to admit the same. The famousclairvoyante, Madame Roger, was charged with obtaining money under falsepretenses, in company with her mesmerist, Dr. Fortin. On May 18th, 1876, she wasarraigned before the Tribunal Correctionnel of the Seine. Her witness was BaronDu Potet, the grand master of mesmerism in France for the last fifty years; heradvocate, the no less famous Jules Favre. Truth for once triumphed--theaccusation was abandoned. Was it the extraordinary eloquence of the orator, orbare facts incontrovertible and unimpeachable that won the day? But Leymarie,the editor of the Revue Spirite, had also facts in his favor; and, moreover, theevidence of over a hundred respectable witnesses, among whom were the firstnames of Europe. To this there is but one answer--the magistrates dared notquestion the facts of mesmerism. Spirit-photography, spirit-rapping, writing,moving, talking, and even spirit-materializations can be simulated; there ishardly a physical phenomenon now in Europe and America but could beimitated--with apparatus--by a clever juggler. The wonders of mesmerism andsubjective phenomena alone defy tricksters, skepticism, stern science, anddishonest mediums; the cataleptic state it is impossible to feign. Spiritualistswho are anxious to have their truths proclaimed and forced on science, cultivatethe mesmeric phenomena. Place on the stage of Egyptian Hall a somnambulistplunged in a deep mesmeric sleep. Let her mesmerist send her freed spirit to allthe places the public may suggest; test her clairvoyance and clairaudience;stick pins into any part of her body which the mesmerist may have made hispasses over; thrust needles through the skin below her eyelids; burn her fleshand lacerate it with a sharp instrument. \"Do not fear!\" exclaim Regazzoni and DuPotet, Teste and Pierrard, Puysegur and Dolgorouky--\"a mesmerized or entrancedsubject is never hurt!\" And when all this is performed, invite any popularwizard of the day who thirsts for puffery, and is, or pretends to be, clever atmimicking every spiritual phenomenon, to submit his body to the same tests! * The speech of Jules Favre is reported to have lasted an hour and a half, and tohave held the judges and the public spellbound by its eloquence. We who haveheard Jules Favre believe it most readily; only the statement embodied in thelast sentence of his argument was unfortunately premature and erroneous at thesame time. \"We are in the presence of a phenomenon which science admits withoutattempting to explain. The public may smile at it, but our most illustriousphysicians regard it with gravity. Justice can no longer ignore what science hasacknowledged!\" Were this sweeping declaration based upon fact and had mesmerism beenimpartially investigated by many instead of a few true men of science, moredesirous of questioning nature than mere expediency, the public would neversmile. The public is a docile and pious child, and readily goes whither thenurse leads it. It chooses its idols and fetishes, and worships them inproportion to the noise they make; and then turns round with a timid look ofadulation to see whether the nurse, old Mrs. Public Opinion, is satisfied. Lactantius, the old Christian father, is said to have remarked that no skepticin his days would have dared to maintain before a magician that the soul did notsurvive the body, but died together with it; \"for he would refute them on thespot by calling up the souls of the dead, rendering them visible to human eyes,and making them foretell future events.\" * So with the magistrates and bench inMadame Roger's case. Baron Du Potet was there, and they were afraid to see himmesmerize the somnambulist, and so force them not only to believe in thephenomenon, but to acknowledge it--which was far worse. And now to the doctrine of Paracelsus. His incomprehensible, though lively stylemust be read like the biblio-rolls of Ezekiel, \"within and without.\" The perilof propounding heterodox theories was great in those days; the Church waspowerful, and sorcerers were burnt by the dozens. For this reason, we findParacelsus, Agrippa, and Eugenius Philalethes as notable for their piousdeclarations as they were famous for their achievements in alchemy and magic.The full views of Paracelsus on the occult properties of the magnet areexplained partially in his famous book, Archidaxarum, in which he describes thewonderful tincture, a medicine extracted from the magnet and called MagisteriumMagnetis, and partially in the De Ente Dei, and De Ente Astrorum, Lib. I. Butthe explanations are all given in a diction unintelligible to the profane.\"Every peasant sees,\" said he, \"that a magnet will attract iron, but a wise manmust inquire for himself. . . . I have discovered that the magnet, besides thisvisible power, that of attracting iron, possesses another and concealed power.\" He demonstrates further that in man lies hidden a \"sidereal force,\" which isthat emanation from the stars and celestial bodies of which the spiritual formof man--the astral spirit--is composed. This identity of essence, which we mayterm the spirit of cometary matter, always stands in direct relation with thestars from which it was drawn, and thus there exists a mutual attraction betweenthe two, both being magnets. The identical composition of the earth and allother planetary bodies and man's terrestrial body was a fundamental idea in hisphilosophy. \"The body comes from the elements, the [astral] spirit from thestars. . . . Man eats and drinks of the elements, for the sustenance of hisblood and flesh; from the stars are the intellect and thoughts sustained in hisspirit.\" The spectroscope has made good his theory as to the identicalcomposition of man and stars; the physicists now lecture to their classes uponthe magnetic attractions of the sun and planets. * Of the substances known to compose the body of man, there have been discoveredin the stars already, hydrogen, sodium, calcium, magnesium and iron. In all thestars observed, numbering many hundreds, hydrogen was found, except in two. Now,if we recollect how they have deprecated Paracelsus and his theory of man andthe stars being composed of like substances; how ridiculed he was by astronomersand physicists, for his ideas of chemical affinity and attraction between thetwo; and then realize that the spectroscope has vindicated one of his assertionsat least, is it so absurd to prophesy that in time all the rest of his theorieswill be substantiated? And now, a very natural question is suggested. How did Paracelsus come to learnanything of the composition of the stars, when, till a very recent period--tillthe discovery of the spectroscope in fact--the constituents of the heavenlybodies were utterly unknown to our learned academies? And even now, notwithstanding tele-spectroscope and other very important modernimprovements, except a few elements and a hypothetical chromosphere, everythingis yet a mystery for them in the stars. Could Paracelsus have been so sure ofthe nature of the starry host, unless he had means of which science knowsnothing? Yet knowing nothing she will not even hear pronounced the very names ofthese means, which are--hermetic philosophy and alchemy. We must bear in mind, moreover, that Paracelsus was the discoverer of hydrogen,and knew well all its properties and composition long before any of the orthodoxacademicians ever thought of it; that he had studied astrology and astronomy, asall the fire-philosophers did; and that, if he did assert that man is in adirect affinity with the stars, he knew well what he asserted. The next point for the physiologists to verify is his proposition that thenourishment of the body comes not merely through the stomach, \"but alsoimperceptibly through the magnetic force, which resides in all nature and bywhich every individual member draws its specific nourishment to itself.\" Man, hefurther says, draws not only health from the elements when in equilibrium, butalso disease when they are disturbed. Living bodies are subject to the laws ofattraction and chemical affinity, as science admits; the most remarkablephysical property of organic tissues, according to physiologists, is theproperty of imbibition. What more natural, then, than this theory of Paracelsus,that this absorbent, attractive, and chemical body of ours gathers into itselfthe astral or sidereal influences? \"The sun and the stars attract from us tothemselves, and we again from them to us.\" What objection can science offer tothis? What it is that we give off, is shown in Baron Reichenbach's discovery ofthe odic emanations of man, which are identical with flames from magnets,crystals, and in fact from all vegetable organisms. The unity of the universe was asserted by Paracelsus, who says that \"the humanbody is possessed of primeval stuff\" (or cosmic matter); the spectroscope hasproved the assertion by showing that the same chemical elements which exist uponearth and in the sun, are also found in all the stars. The spectroscope doesmore: it shows that all the stars are suns, similar in constitution to ourown; * and as we are told by Professor Mayer, ** that the magnetic condition ofthe earth changes with every variation upon the sun's surface, and is said to be\"in subjection to emanations from the sun,\" the stars being suns must also giveoff emanations which affect us in proportionate degrees. \"In our dreams,\" says Paracelsus, \"we are like the plants, which have also theelementary and vital body, but possess not the spirit. In our sleep the astralbody is free and can, by the elasticity of its nature, either hover round inproximity with its sleeping vehicle, or soar higher to hold converse with itsstarry parents, or even communicate with its brothers at great distances. Dreamsof a prophetic character, prescience, and present wants, are the faculties ofthe astral spirit. To our elementary and grosser body, these gifts are notimparted, for at death it descends into the bosom of the earth and is reunitedto the physical elements, while the several spirits return to the stars. Theanimals,\" he adds, \"have also their presentiments, for they too have an astralbody.\" Van Helmont, who was a disciple of Paracelsus, says much the same, though histheories on magnetism are more largely developed, and still more carefullyelaborated. The Magnale Magnum, the means by which the secret magnetic property\"enables one person to affect another mutually, is attributed by him to thatuniversal sympathy which exists between all things in nature. The cause producesthe effect, the effect refers itself back to the cause, and both arereciprocated. \"Magnetism,\" he says, \"is an unknown property of a heavenlynature; very much resembling the stars, and not at all impeded by any boundariesof space or time. . . . Every created being possesses his own celestial powerand is closely allied with heaven. This magic power of man, which thus canoperate externally, lies, as it were, hidden in the inner man. This magicalwisdom and strength thus sleeps, but, by a mere suggestion is roused intoactivity, and becomes more living, the more the outer man of flesh and thedarkness is repressed . . . and this, I say, the kabalistic art effects; itbrings back to the soul that magical yet natural strength which like a startledsleep had left it.\" * Both Van Helmont and Paracelsus agree as to the great potency of the will in thestate of ecstasy; they say that \"the spirit is everywhere diffused; and thespirit is the medium of magnetism\"; that pure primeval magic does not consist insuperstitious practices and vain ceremonies but in the imperial will of man. \"Itis not the spirits of heaven and of hell which are the masters over physicalnature, but the soul and spirit of man which are concealed in him as the fire isconcealed in the flint.\" The theory of the sidereal influence on man was enunciated by all the mediaevalphilosophers. \"The stars consist equally of the elements of earthly bodies,\"says Cornelius Agrippa, \"and therefore the ideas attract each other. . . .Influences only go forth through the help of the spirit; but this spirit isdiffused through the whole universe and is in full accord with the humanspirits. The magician who would acquire supernatural powers must possess faith,love, and hope. . . . In all things there is a secret power concealed, andthence come the miraculous powers of magic.\" The modern theory of General Pleasonton * singularly coincides with the views ofthe fire-philosophers. His view of the positive and negative electricities ofman and woman, and the mutual attraction and repulsion of everything in natureseems to be copied from that of Robert Fludd, the Grand Master of theRosicrucians of England. \"When two men approach each other,\" says thefire-philosopher, \"their magnetism is either passive or active; that is,positive or negative. If the emanations which they send out are broken or thrownback, there arises antipathy. But when the emanations pass through each otherfrom both sides, then there is positive magnetism, for the rays proceed from thecentre to the circumference. In this case they not only affect sicknesses butalso moral sentiments. This magnetism or sympathy is found not only amonganimals but also in plants and in minerals.\" ** And now we will notice how, when Mesmer had imported into France his \"baquet\"and system based entirely on the philosophy and doctrines of theParacelsites--the great psychological and physiological discovery was treated bythe physicians. It will demonstrate how much ignorance, superficiality, andprejudice can be displayed by a scientific body, when the subject clashes withtheir own cherished theories. It is the more important because, to the neglectof the committee of the French Academy of 1784 is probably due the presentmaterialistic drift of the public mind; and certainly the gaps in the atomicphilosophy which we have seen its most devoted teachers confessing to exist. Thecommittee of 1784 comprised men of such eminence as Borie, Sallin, d'Arcet, andthe famous Guillotin, to whom were subsequently added, Franklin, Leroi, Bailly,De Borg and Lavoisier. Borie died shortly afterward and Magault succeeded him.There can be no doubt of two things, viz.: that the committee began their workunder strong prejudices and only because peremptorily ordered to do it by theking; and that their manner of observing the delicate facts of mesmerism wasinjudicious and illiberal. Their report, drawn by Bailly, was intended to be adeath-blow to the new science. It was spread ostentatiously throughout all theschools and ranks of society, arousing the bitterest feelings among a largeportion of the aristocracy and rich commercial class, who had patronized Mesmerand had been eye-witnesses of his cures. Ant. L. de Jussieu, an academician ofthe highest rank, who had thoroughly investigated the subject with the eminentcourt-physician, d'Eslon, published a counter-report drawn with minuteexactness, in which he advocated the careful observation by the medical facultyof the therapeutic effects of the magnetic fluid and insisted upon the immediatepublication of their discoveries and observations. His demand was met by theappearance of a great number of memoirs, polemical works, and dogmatical booksdeveloping new facts; and Thouret's works entitled Recherches et Doutes sur leMagnetisme Animal, displaying a vast erudition, stimulated research into therecords of the past, and the magnetic phenomena of successive nations from theremotest antiquity were laid before the public. The doctrine of Mesmer was simply a restatement of the doctrines of Paracelsus,Van Helmont, Santanelli, and Maxwell, the Scotchman; and he was even guilty ofcopying texts from the work of Bertrand, and enunciating them as his ownprinciples. * In Professor Stewart's work, ** the author regards our universe ascomposed of atoms with some sort of medium between them as the machine, and thelaws of energy as the laws working this machine. Professor Youmans calls this \"amodern doctrine,\" but we find among the twenty-seven propositions laid down byMesmer, in 1775, just one century earlier, in his Letter to a Foreign Physician,the following: 1st. There exists a mutual influence between the heavenly bodies, the earth, andliving bodies. 2d. A fluid, universally diffused and continued, so as to admit no vacuum, whosesubtility is beyond all comparison, and which, from its nature, is capable ofreceiving, propagating, and communicating all the impressions of motion, is themedium of this influence. It would appear from this, that the theory is not so modern after all. ProfessorBalfour Stewart says, \"We may regard the universe in the light of a vastphysical machine.\" And Mesmer: 3d. This reciprocal action is subject to mechanical laws, unknown up to thepresent time. Professor Mayer, reaffirming Gilbert's doctrine that the earth is a greatmagnet, remarks that the mysterious variations in the intensity of its forceseem to be in subjection to emanations from the sun, \"changing with the apparentdaily and yearly revolutions of that orb, and pulsating in sympathy with thehuge waves of fire which sweep over its surface.\" He speaks of \"the constantfluctuation, the ebb and flow of the earth's directive influence.\" And Mesmer: 4th. \"From this action result alternate effects which may be considered a fluxand reflux.\" 6th. It is by this operation (the most universal of those presented to us bynature) that the relations of activity occur between the heavenly bodies, theearth, and its constituent parts. There are two more which will be interesting reading to our modern scientists: 7th. The properties of matter, and of organized body, depend on this operation. 8th. The animal body experiences the alternate effects of this agent; and it isby insinuating itself into the substance of the nerves, that it immediatelyaffects them. Among other important works which appeared between 1798 and 1824, when theFrench Academy appointed its second commission to investigate mesmerism, theAnnales du Magnetisme Animal, by the Baron d'Henin de Cuvillier,Lieutenant-General, Chevalier of St. Louis, member of the Academy of Sciences,and correspondent of many of the learned societies of Europe, may be consultedwith great advantage. In 1820 the Prussian government instructed the Academy ofBerlin to offer a prize of three hundred ducats in gold for the best thesis onmesmerism. The Royal Scientific Society of Paris, under the presidency of HisRoyal Highness the Duc d'Angouleme, offered a gold medal for the same purpose.The Marquis de la Place, peer of France, one of the Forty of the Academy ofSciences, and honorary member of the learned societies of all the principalEuropean governments, issued a work entitled Essai Philosophique sur lesProbabilites, in which this eminent scientist says: \"Of all the instruments thatwe can employ to know the imperceptible agents of nature, the most sensitive arethe nerves, especially when exceptional influences increase their sensibility. .. . The singular phenomena which result from this extreme nervous sensitivenessof certain individuals, have given birth to diverse opinions as to the existenceof a new agent, which has been named animal magnetism. . . . We are so far fromknowing all the agents of nature and their various modes of action that it wouldbe hardly philosophical to deny the phenomena, simply because they areinexplicable, in the actual state of our information. It is simply our duty toexamine them with an attention as much more scrupulous as it seems difficult toadmit them.\" The experiments of Mesmer were vastly improved upon by the Marquis de Puysegur,who entirely dispensed with apparatus and produced remarkable cures among thetenants of his estate at Busancy. These being given to the public, many othereducated men experimented with like success, and in 1825 M. Foissac proposed tothe Academy of Medicine to institute a new inquiry. A special committee,consisting of Adelon, Parisey, Marc, Burdin, Sen., with Husson as reporter,united in a recommendation that the suggestion should be adopted. They make themanly avowal that \"in science no decision whatever is absolute and irrevocable,\"and afford us the means to estimate the value which should be attached to theconclusions of the Franklin committee of 1784, by saying that \"the experimentson which this judgment was founded appeared to have been conducted without thesimultaneous and necessary assembling together of all the commissioners, andalso with moral predispositions, which, according to the principles of the factwhich they were appointed to examine, must cause their complete failure.\" What they say concerning magnetism as a secret remedy, has been said many timesby the most respected writers upon modern Spiritualism, namely: \"It is the dutyof the Academy to study it, to subject it to trials; finally, to take away theuse and practice of it from persons quite strangers to the art, who abuse thismeans, and make it an object of lucre and speculation.\" This report provoked long debates, but in May, 1826, the Academy appointed acommission which comprised the following illustrious names: Leroux, Bourdois dela Motte, Double, Magendie, Guersant, Husson, Thillaye, Marc, Itard, Fouquier,and Guenau de Mussy. They began their labors immediately, and continued themfive years, communicating, through Monsieur Husson, to the Academy the resultsof their observations. The report embraces accounts of phenomena classifiedunder thirty-four different paragraphs, but as this work is not speciallydevoted to the science of magnetism, we must be content with a few briefextracts. They assert that neither contact of the hands, frictions, nor passesare invariably needed, since, on several occasions, the will, fixedness ofstare, have sufficed to produce magnetic phenomena, even without the knowledgeof the magnetized. \"Well-attested and therapeutical phenomena\" depend onmagnetism alone, and are not reproduced without it. The state of somnambulismexists and \"occasions the development of new faculties, which have received thedenominations of clairvoyance, intuition, internal prevision.\" Sleep (themagnetic) has \"been excited under circumstances where those magnetized could notsee, and were entirely ignorant of the means employed to occasion it. Themagnetizer, having once controlled his subject, may \"put him completely intosomnambulism, take him out of it without his knowledge, out of his sight, at acertain distance, and through closed doors.\" The external senses of the sleeperseem to be completely paralyzed, and a duplicate set to be brought into action.\"Most of the time they are entirely strangers to the external and unexpectednoise made in their ears, such as the sound of copper vessels, forcibly struck,the fall of any heavy substance, and so forth. . . . One may make them respirehydrochloric acid or ammonia without inconveniencing them by it, or without evena suspicion on their part.\" The committee could \"tickle their feet, nostrils,and the angles of the eyes by the approach of a feather, pinch their skin so asto produce ecchymosis, prick it under the nails with pins plunged to aconsiderable depth, without the evincing of any pain, or by sign of being at allaware of it. In a word, we have seen one person who was insensible to one of themost painful operations of surgery, and whose countenance, pulse, or respirationdid not manifest the slightest emotion.\" So much for the external senses; now let us see what they have to say about theinternal ones, which may fairly be considered as proving a marked differencebetween man and a mutton-protoplasm. \"Whilst they are in this state ofsomnambulism,\" say the committee, \"the magnetized persons we have observed,retain the exercise of the faculties which they have whilst awake. Their memoryeven appears to be more faithful and more extensive. . . . We have seen twosomnambulists distinguish, width their eyes shut, the objects placed beforethem; they have told, without touching them, the color and value of the cards;they have read words traced with the hand, or some lines of books opened by merechance. This phenomenon took place, even when the opening of the eyelids wasaccurately closed, by means of the fingers. We met, in two somnambulists, thepower of foreseeing acts more or less complicated of the organism. One of themannounced several days, nay, several months beforehand, the day, the hour, andthe minute when epileptic fits would come on and return; the other declared thetime of the cure. Their previsions were realized with remarkable exactness.\" The commission say that \"it has collected and communicated facts sufficientlyimportant to induce it to think that the Academy should encourage the researcheson magnetism as a very curious branch of psychology and natural history.\" Thecommittee conclude by saying that the facts are so extraordinary that theyscarcely imagine that the Academy will concede their reality, but protest thatthey have been throughout animated by motives of a lofty character, \"the love ofscience and by the necessity of justifying the hopes which the Academy hadentertained of our zeal and our devotion.\" Their fears were fully justified by the conduct of at least one member of theirown number, who had absented himself from the experiments, and, as M. Hussontells us, \"did not deem it right to sign the report.\" This was Magendie, the physiologist, who, despite the fact stated by theofficial report that he had not \"been present at the experiments,\" did nothesitate to devote four pages of his famous work on Human Physiology to thesubject of mesmerism, and after summarizing its alleged phenomena, withoutendorsing them as unreservedly as the erudition and scientific acquirements ofhis fellow committee-men would seem to have exacted, says: \"Self-respect and thedignity of the profession demand circumspection on these points. He [thewell-informed physician] will remember how readily mystery glides intocharlatanry, and how apt the profession is to become degraded even by itssemblance when countenanced by respectable practitioners.\" No word in thecontext lets his readers into the secret that he had been duly appointed by theAcademy to serve on the commission of 1826; had absented himself from itssittings; had so failed to learn the truth about mesmeric phenomena, and was nowpronouncing judgment ex parte. \"Self-respect and the dignity of the profession\"probably exacted silence! Thirty-eight years later, an English scientist, whose specialty is theinvestigation of physics, and whose reputation is even greater than that ofMagendie, stooped to as unfair a course of conduct. When the opportunity offeredto investigate the spiritualistic phenomena, and aid in taking it out of thehands of ignorant or dishonest investigators, Professor John Tyndall avoided thesubject; but in his Fragments of Science, he was guilty of the ungentlemanlyexpressions which we have quoted in another place. But we are wrong; he made one attempt, and that sufficed. He tells us, in theFragments, that he once got under a table, to see how the raps were made, andarose with a despair for humanity, such as he never felt before! Israel Putnam,crawling on hand and knee to kill the she-wolf in her den, partially affords aparallel by which to estimate the chemist's courage in groping in the dark afterthe ugly truth; but Putnam killed his wolf, and Tyndall was devoured by his!\"Sub mensa desperatio\" should be the motto on his shield. Speaking of the report of the committee of 1824, Dr. Alphonse Teste, adistinguished contemporaneous scientist, says that it produced a greatimpression on the Academy, but few convictions: \"No one could question theveracity of the commissioners, whose good faith as well as great knowledge wereundeniable, but they were suspected of having been dupes. In fact, there arecertain unfortunate truths which compromise those who believe in them, and thoseespecially who are so candid as to avow them publicly.\" How true this is, letthe records of history, from the earliest times to this very day, attest. WhenProfessor Robert Hare announced the preliminary results of his spiritualisticinvestigations, he, albeit one of the most eminent chemists and physicists inthe world, was, nevertheless, regarded as a dupe. When he proved that he wasnot, he was charged with having fallen into dotage; the Harvard professorsdenouncing \"his insane adherence to the gigantic humbug.\" When the professor began his investigations in 1853, he announced that he \"feltcalled upon, as an act of duty to his fellow-creatures, to bring whateverinfluence he possessed to the attempt to stem the tide of popular madness,which, in defiance of reason and science, was fast setting in favor of the grossdelusion called Spiritualism.\" Though, according to his declaration, he\"entirely coincided with Faraday's theory of table-turning,\" he had the truegreatness which characterizes the princes of science to make his investigationthorough, and then tell the truth. How he was rewarded by his life-longassociates, let his own words tell. In an address delivered in New York, inSeptember, 1854, he says that \"he had been engaged in scientific pursuits forupwards of half a century, and his accuracy and precision had never beenquestioned, until he had become a spiritualist; while his integrity as a man hadnever in his life been assailed, until the Harvard professors fulminated theirreport against that which he knew to be true, and which they did not know to befalse.\" How much mournful pathos is expressed in these few words! An old man ofseventy-six--a scientist of half a century, deserted for telling the truth! Andnow Mr. A. R. Wallace, who had previously been esteemed among the mostillustrious of British scientists, having proclaimed his belief in spiritualismand mesmerism, is spoken of in terms of compassion. Professor Nicholas Wagner,of St. Petersburg, whose reputation as a zoologist is one of the mostconspicuous, in his turn pays the penalty of his exceptional candor, in hisoutrageous treatment by the Russian scientists! There are scientists and scientists and if the occult sciences suffer in theinstance of modern spiritualism from the malice of one class, nevertheless, theyhave had their defenders at all times among men whose names have shed lustreupon science itself. In the first rank stands Isaac Newton, \"the light ofscience,\" who was a thorough believer in magnetism, as taught by Paracelsus, VanHelmont, and by the fire-philosophers in general. No one will presume to denythat his doctrine of universal space and attraction is purely a theory ofmagnetism. If his own words mean anything at all, they mean that he based allhis speculations upon the \"soul of the world,\" the great universal, magneticagent, which he called the divine sensorium. * \"Here,\" he says, \"the question isof a very subtile spirit which penetrates through all, even the hardest bodies,and which is concealed in their substance. Through the strength and activity ofthis spirit, bodies attract each other, and adhere together when brought intocontact. Through it, electrical bodies operate at the remotest distance, as wellas near at hand, attracting and repelling; through this spirit the light alsoflows, and is refracted and reflected, and warms bodies. All senses are excitedby this spirit, and through it the animals move their limbs. But these thingscannot be explained in few words, and we have not yet sufficient experience todetermine fully the laws by which this universal spirit operates.\" There are two kinds of magnetization; the first is purely animal, the othertranscendent, and depending on the will and knowledge of the mesmerizer, as wellas on the degree of spirituality of the subject, and his capacity to receive theimpressions of the astral light. But now it is next to ascertain thatclairvoyance depends a great deal more on the former than on the latter. To thepower of an adept, like Du Potet, the most positive subject will have to submit.If his sight is ably directed by the mesmerizer, magician, or spirit, the lightmust yield up its most secret records to our scrutiny; for, if it is a bookwhich is ever closed to those \"who see and do not perceive,\" on the other handit is ever opened for one who wills to see it opened. It keeps an unmutilatedrecord of all that was, that is, or ever will be. The minutest acts of our livesare imprinted on it, and even our thoughts rest photographed on its eternaltablets. It is the book which we see opened by the angel in the Revelation,\"which is the Book of life, and out of which the dead are judged according totheir works.\" It is, in short, the MEMORY of GOD! \"The oracles assert that the impression of thoughts, characters, men, and otherdivine visions, appear in the aether. . . . In this the things without figureare figured,\" says an ancient fragment of the Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster. * Thus, ancient as well as modern wisdom, vaticination and science, agree incorroborating the claims of the kabalists. It is on the indestructible tabletsof the astral light that is stamped the impression of every thought we think,and every act we perform; and that future events--effects of long-forgottencauses--are already delineated as a vivid picture for the eye of the seer andprophet to follow. Memory--the despair of the materialist, the enigma of thepsychologist, the sphinx of science--is to the student of old philosophiesmerely a name to express that power which man unconsciously exerts, and shareswith many of the inferior animals--to look with inner sight into the astrallight, and there behold the images of past sensations and incidents. Instead ofsearching the cerebral ganglia for \"micrographs of the living and the dead, ofscenes that we have visited, of incidents in which we have borne a part,\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu005.htm#fn_255] they went to the vastrepository where the records of every man's life as well as every pulsation ofthe visible cosmos are stored up for all Eternity! That flash of memory which is traditionally supposed to show a drowning manevery long-forgotten scene of his mortal life--as the landscape is revealed tothe traveller by intermittent flashes of lightning--is simply the sudden glimpsewhich the struggling soul gets into the silent galleries where his history isdepicted in imperishable colors. The well-known fact--one corroborated by the personal experience of nine personsout of ten--that we often recognize as familiar to us, scenes, and landscapes,and conversations, which we see or hear for the first time, and sometimes incountries never visited before, is a result of the same causes. Believers inreincarnation adduce this as an additional proof of our antecedent existence inother bodies. This recognition of men, countries, and things that we have neverseen, is attributed by them to flashes of soul-memory of anterior experiences.But the men of old, in common with mediaeval philosophers, firmly held to acontrary opinion. They affirmed that though this psychological phenomenon was one of the greatestarguments in favor of immortality and the soul's preexistence, yet the latterbeing endowed with an individual memory apart from that of our physical brain,it is no proof of reincarnation. As Eliphas Levi beautifully expresses it,\"nature shuts the door after everything that passes, and pushes life onward\" inmore perfected forms. The chrysalis becomes a butterfly; the latter can neverbecome again a grub. In the stillness of the night-hours, when our bodily sensesare fast locked in the fetters of sleep, and our elementary body rests, theastral form becomes free. It then oozes out of its earthly prison, and asParacelsus has it--\"confabulates with the outward world,\" and travels round thevisible as well as the invisible worlds. \"In sleep,\" he says, \"the astral body(soul) is in freer motion; then it soars to its parents, and holds converse withthe stars.\" Dreams, forebodings, prescience, prognostications and presentimentsare impressions left by our astral spirit on our brain, which receives them moreor less distinctly, according to the proportion of blood with which it issupplied during the hours of sleep. The more the body is exhausted, the freer isthe spiritual man, and the more vivid the impressions of our soul's memory. Inheavy and robust sleep, dreamless and uninterrupted, upon awakening to outwardconsciousness, men may sometimes remember nothing. But the impressions of scenesand landscapes which the astral body saw in its peregrinations are still there,though lying latent under the pressure of matter. They may be awakened at anymoment, and then, during such flashes of man's inner memory, there is aninstantaneous interchange of energies between the visible and the invisibleuniverses. Between the \"micrographs\" of the cerebral ganglia and thephoto-scenographic galleries of the astral light, a current is established. Anda man who knows that he has never visited in body, nor seen the landscape andperson that he recognizes may well assert that still has he seen and knows them,for the acquaintance was formed while travelling in \"spirit.\" To this thephysiologists can have but one objection. They will answer that in naturalsleep--perfect and deep, \"half of our nature which is volitional is in thecondition of inertia\"; hence unable to travel; the more so as the existence ofany such individual astral body or soul is considered by them little else than apoetical myth. Blumenbach assures us that in the state of sleep, all intercoursebetween mind and body is suspended; an assertion which is denied by Dr.Richardson, F. R. S., who honestly reminds the German scientist that \"theprecise limits and connections of mind and body being unknown\" it is more thanshould be said. This confession, added to those of the French physiologist,Fournie, and the still more recent one of Dr. Allchin, an eminent Londonphysician, who frankly avowed, in an address to students, that \"of allscientific pursuits which practically concern the community, there is noneperhaps which rests upon so uncertain and insecure a basis as medicine,\" givesus a certain right to offset the hypotheses of ancient scientists against thoseof the modern ones. No man, however gross and material he may be, can avoid leading a doubleexistence; one in the visible universe, the other in the invisible. Thelife-principle which animates his physical frame is chiefly in the astral body;and while the more animal portions of him rest, the more spiritual ones knowneither limits nor obstacles. We are perfectly aware that many learned, as wellas the unlearned, will object to such a novel theory of the distribution of thelife-principle. They would prefer remaining in blissful ignorance and go onconfessing that no one knows or can pretend to tell whence and whither thismysterious agent appears and disappears, than to give one moment's attention towhat they consider old and exploded theories. Some might object on the groundtaken by theology, that dumb brutes have no immortal souls, and hence, can haveno astral spirits; for theologians as well as laymen labor under the erroneousimpression that soul and spirit are one and the same thing. But if we study Plato and other philosophers of old, we may readily perceivethat while the \"irrational soul,\" by which Plato meant our astral body, or themore ethereal representation of ourselves, can have at best only a more or lessprolonged continuity of existence beyond the grave; the divine spirit--wronglytermed soul, by the Church--is immortal by its very essence. (Any Hebrew scholarwill readily appreciate the distinction who comprehends the difference betweenthe two words רוח ruah and נפשׁ nephesh.) If the life-principle is somethingapart from the astral spirit and in no way connected with it, why is it that theintensity of the clairvoyant powers depends so much on the bodily prostration ofthe subject? The deeper the trance, the less signs of life the body shows, theclearer become the spiritual perceptions, and the more powerful are the soul'svisions. The soul, disburdened of the bodily senses, shows activity of power ina far greater degree of intensity than it can in a strong, healthy body. Brierrede Boismont gives repeated instances of this fact. The organs of sight, smell,taste, touch, and hearing are proved to become far acuter in a mesmerizedsubject deprived of the possibility of exercising them bodily, than while heuses them in his normal state. Such facts alone, once proved, ought to stand as invincible demonstrations ofthe continuity of individual life, at least for a certain period after the bodyhas been left by us, either by reason of its being worn out or by accident. Butthough during its brief sojourn on earth our soul may be assimilated to a lighthidden under a bushel, it still shines more or less bright and attracts toitself the influences of kindred spirits; and when a thought of good or evilimport is begotten in our brain, it draws to it impulses of like nature asirresistibly as the magnet attracts iron filings. This attraction is alsoproportionate to the intensity with which the thought-impulse makes itself feltin the ether; and so it will be understood how one man may impress himself uponhis own epoch so forcibly, that the influence may be carried--through theever-interchanging currents of energy between the two worlds, the visible andthe invisible--from one succeeding age to another, until it affects a largeportion of mankind. How much the authors of the famous work entitled the Unseen Universe may haveallowed themselves to think in this direction, it would be difficult to say; butthat they have not told all they might will be inferred from the followinglanguage: \"Regard it as you please, there can be no doubt that the properties of the etherare of a much higher order in the arcana of nature than those of tangiblematter. And, as even the high priests of science still find the latter farbeyond their comprehension, except in numerous but minute and often isolatedparticulars, it would not become us to speculate further. It is sufficient forour purpose to know from what the ether certainly does, that it is capable ofvastly more than any has yet ventured to say.\" One of the most interesting discoveries of modern times, is that of the facultywhich enables a certain class of sensitive persons to receive from any objectheld in the hand or against the forehead impressions of the character orappearance of the individual, or any other object with which it has previouslybeen in contact. Thus a manuscript, painting, article of clothing, orjewelry--no matter how ancient--conveys to the sensitive, a vivid picture of thewriter, painter, or wearer; even though he lived in the days of Ptolemy orEnoch. Nay, more; a fragment of an ancient building will recall its history andeven the scenes which transpired within or about it. A bit of ore will carry thesoul-vision back to the time when it was in process of formation. This facultyis called by its discoverer--Professor J. R. Buchanan, of Louisville,Kentucky--psychometry. To him, the world is indebted for this most importantaddition to Psychological Sciences; and to him, perhaps, when skepticism isfound felled to the ground by such accumulation of facts, posterity will have toelevate a statue. In announcing to the public his great discovery, ProfessorBuchanan, confining himself to the power of psychometry to delineate humancharacter, says: \"The mental and physiological influence imparted to writingappears to be imperishable, as the oldest specimens I have investigated gavetheir impressions with a distinctness and force, little impaired by time. Oldmanuscripts, requiring an antiquary to decipher their strange old penmanship,were easily interpreted by the psychometric power. . . . The property ofretaining the impress of mind is not limited to writing. Drawings, paintings,everything upon which human contact, thought, and volition have been expended,may become linked with that thought and life, so as to recall them to the mindof another when in contact.\" Without, perhaps, really knowing, at the early time of the grand discovery, thesignificance of his own prophetic words, the Professor adds: \"This discovery, inits application to the arts and to history, will open a mine of interestingknowledge.\" * The existence of this faculty was first experimentally demonstrated in 1841. Ithas since been verified by a thousand psychometers in different parts of theworld. It proves that every occurrence in nature--no matter how minute orunimportant--leaves its indelible impress upon physical nature; and, as therehas been no appreciable molecular disturbance, the only inference possible is,that these images have been produced by that invisible, universal force--Ether,or astral light. In his charming work, entitled The Soul of Things, Professor Denton, thegeologist, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu005.htm#fn_257] enters atgreat length into a discussion of this subject. He gives a multitude of examplesof the psychometrical power, which Mrs. Denton possesses in a marked degree. Afragment of Cicero's house, at Tusculum, enabled her to describe, without theslightest intimation as to the nature of the object placed on her forehead, notonly the great orator's surroundings, but also the previous owner of thebuilding, Cornelius Sulla Felix, or, as he is usually called, Sulla theDictator. A fragment of marble from the ancient Christian Church of Smyrna,brought before her its congregation and officiating priests. Specimens fromNineveh, China, Jerusalem, Greece, Ararat, and other places all over the worldbrought up scenes in the life of various personages, whose ashes had beenscattered thousands of years ago. In many cases Professor Denton verified thestatements by reference to historical records. More than this, a bit of theskeleton, or a fragment of the tooth of some antediluvian animal, caused theseeress to perceive the creature as it was when alive, and even live for a fewbrief moments its life, and experience its sensations. Before the eager quest ofthe psychometer, the most hidden recesses of the domain of nature yield up theirsecrets; and the events of the most remote epochs rival in vividness ofimpression the flitting circumstances of yesterday. Says the author, in the same work: \"Not a leaf waves, not an insect crawls, nota ripple moves, but each motion is recorded by a thousand faithful scribes ininfallible and indelible scripture. This is just as true of all past time. Fromthe dawn of light upon this infant globe, when round its cradle the steamycurtains hung, to this moment, nature has been busy photographing everything.What a picture-gallery is hers!\" It appears to us the height of impossibility to imagine that scenes in ancientThebes, or in some temple of prehistoric times should be photographed only uponthe substance of certain atoms. The images of the events are imbedded in thatall-permeating, universal, and ever-retaining medium, which the philosopherscall the \"Soul of the World,\" and Mr. Denton \"the Soul of Things.\" Thepsychometer, by applying the fragment of a substance to his forehead, brings hisinner-self into relations with the inner soul of the object he handles. It isnow admitted that the universal aether pervades all things in nature, even themost solid. It is beginning to be admitted, also, that this preserves the imagesof all things which transpire. When the psychometer examines his specimen, he isbrought in contact with the current of the astral light, connected with thatspecimen, and which retains pictures of the events associated with its history.These, according to Denton, pass before his vision with the swiftness of light;scene after scene crowding upon each other so rapidly, that it is only by thesupreme exercise of the will that he is able to hold any one in the field ofvision long enough to describe it. The psychometer is clairvoyant; that is, he sees with the inner eye. Unless hiswill-power is very strong, unless he has thoroughly trained himself to thatparticular phenomenon, and his knowledge of the capabilities of his sight areprofound, his perceptions of places, persons, and events, must necessarily bevery confused. But in the case of mesmerization, in which this same clairvoyantfaculty is developed, the operator, whose will holds that of the subject undercontrol, can force him to concentrate his attention upon a given picture longenough to observe all its minute details. Moreover, under the guidance of anexperienced mesmerizer, the seer would excel the natural psychometer in having aprevision of future events, more distinct and clear than the latter. And tothose who might object to the possibility of perceiving that which \"yet is not,\"we may put the question: Why is it more impossible to see that which will be,than to bring back to sight that which is gone, and is no more? According to thekabalistic doctrine, the future exists in the astral light in embryo, as thepresent existed in embryo in the past. While man is free to act as he pleases,the manner in which he will act was foreknown from all time; not on the groundof fatalism or destiny, but simply on the principle of universal, unchangeableharmony; and, as it may be foreknown that, when a musical note is struck, itsvibrations will not, and cannot change into those of another note. Besides,eternity can have neither past nor future, but only the present; as boundlessspace, in its strictly literal sense, can have neither distant nor proximateplaces. Our conceptions, limited to the narrow area of our experience, attemptto fit if not an end, at least a beginning of time and space; but neither ofthese exist in reality; for in such case time would not be eternal, nor spaceboundless. The past no more exists than the future, as we have said, only ourmemories survive; and our memories are but the glimpses that we catch of thereflections of this past in the currents of the astral light, as the psychometercatches them from the astral emanations of the object held by him. Says Professor E. Hitchcock, when speaking of the influences of light uponbodies, and of the formation of pictures upon them by means of it: \"It seems,then, that this photographic influence pervades all nature; nor can we say whereit stops. We do not know but it may imprint upon the world around us ourfeatures, as they are modified by various passions, and thus fill nature withdaguerreotype impressions of all our actions; . . . it may be, too, that thereare tests by which nature, more skilful than any photographist, can bring outand fix these portraits, so that acuter senses than ours shall see them as on agreat canvas, spread over the material universe. Perhaps, too, they may neverfade from that canvas, but become specimens in the great picture-gallery ofeternity.\" * The \"perhaps\" of Professor Hitchcock is henceforth changed by the demonstrationof psychometry into a triumphant certitude. Those who understand thesepsychological and clairvoyant faculties will take exception to ProfessorHitchcock's idea, that acuter senses than ours are needed to see these picturesupon his supposed cosmic canvas, and maintain that he should have confined hislimitations to the external senses of the body. The human spirit, being of theDivine, immortal Spirit, appreciates neither past nor future, but sees allthings as in the present. These daguerreotypes referred to in the abovequotation are imprinted upon the astral light, where, as we said before--and,according to the Hermetic teaching, the first portion of which is alreadyaccepted and demonstrated by science--is kept the record of all that was, is, orever will be. Of late, some of our learned men have given a particular attention to a subjecthitherto branded with the mark of \"superstition.\" They begin speculating onhypothetical and invisible worlds. The authors of the Unseen Universe were thefirst to boldly take the lead, and already they find a follower in ProfessorFiske, whose speculations are given in the Unseen World. Evidently thescientists are probing the insecure ground of materialism, and, feeling ittrembling under their feet, are preparing for a less dishonorable surrender ofarms in case of defeat. Jevons confirms Babbage, and both firmly believe thatevery thought, displacing the particles of the brain and setting them in motion,scatters them throughout the universe, and think that \"each particle of theexisting matter must be a register of all that has happened.\" ** On the otherhand, Dr. Thomas Young, in his lectures on natural philosophy, most positivelyinvites us to \"speculate with freedom on the possibility of independent worlds;some existing in different parts, others pervading each other, unseen andunknown, in the same space, and others again to which space may not be anecessary mode of existence.\" If scientists, proceeding from a strictly scientific point of view, such as thepossibility of energy being transferred into the invisible universe--and on theprinciple of continuity, indulge in such speculations, why should occultists andspiritualists be refused the same privilege? Ganglionic impressions on thesurface of polished metal, are registered and may be preserved for an indefinitespace of time, according to science; and Professor Draper illustrates the factmost poetically. \"A shadow,\" says he, \"never falls upon a wall without leavingthereupon a permanent trace, a trace which might be made visible by resorting toproper processes. . . . The portraits of our friends, or landscape-views, may behidden on the sensitive surface from the eye, but they are ready to make theirappearance, as soon as proper developers are resorted to. A spectre is concealedon a silver or glassy surface, until, by our necromancy, we make it come forthinto the visible world. Upon the walls of our most private apartments, where wethink the eye of intrusion is altogether shut out, and our retirement can neverbe profaned, there exist the vestiges of all our acts, silhouettes of whateverwe have done.\" * If an indelible impression may be thus obtained on inorganic matter, and ifnothing is lost or passes completely out of existence in the universe, why sucha scientific levee of arms against the authors of the Unseen Universe? And onwhat ground can they reject the hypothesis that \"Thought, conceived to affectthe matter of another universe simultaneously with this, may explain a futurestate?\" ** In our opinion, if psychometry is one of the grandest proofs of theindestructibility of matter, retaining eternally the impressions of the outwardworld, the possession of that faculty by our inner sight is a still greater onein favor of the immortality of man's individual spirit. Capable of discerningevents which took place hundreds of thousands of years ago, why would it notapply the same faculty to a future lost in the eternity, in which there can beneither past nor future, but only one boundless present? Notwithstanding the confessions of stupendous ignorance in some things, made bythe scientists themselves, they still deny the existence of that mysteriousspiritual force, lying beyond the grasp of the ordinary physical laws. Theystill hope to be able to apply to living beings the same laws which they havefound to answer in reference to dead matter. And, having discovered what thekabalists term \"the gross purgations\" of Ether--light, heat, electricity, andmotion--they have rejoiced over their good fortune, counted its vibrations inproducing the colors of the spectrum; and, proud of their achievements, refuseto see any further. Several men of science have pondered more or less over itsprotean essence, and unable to measure it with their photometers, called it \"anhypothetical medium of great elasticity and extreme tenuity, supposed to pervadeall space, the interior of solid bodies not excepted\"; and, \"to be the medium oftransmission of light and heat\" (Dictionary). Others, whom we will name \"thewill-o'-the-wisps\" of science--her pseudo-sons--examined it also, and even wentto the trouble of scrutinizing it \"through powerful glasses,\" they tell us. Butperceiving neither spirits nor ghosts in it, and failing equally to discover inits treacherous waves anything of a more scientific character, they turned roundand called all believers in immortality in general, and spiritualists inparticular, \"insane fools\" and \"visionary lunatics\"; * the whole, in dolefulaccents, perfectly appropriate to the circumstance of such a sad failure. Say the authors of the Unseen Universe: \"We have driven the operation of that mystery called Life out of the objectiveuniverse. The mistake made, lies in imagining that by this process theycompletely get rid of a thing so driven before them, and that it disappears fromthe universe altogether. It does no such thing. It only disappears from thatsmall circle of light which we may call the universe of scientific perception.Call it the trinity of mystery: mystery of matter, the mystery of life and--themystery of God--and these three are One.\" ** Taking the ground that \"the visible universe must certainly, in transformableenergy, and probably in matter, come to an end,\" and \"the principle ofcontinuity . . . still demanding a continuance of the universe. . .\" the authorsof this remarkable work find themselves forced to believe \"that there issomething beyond that which is visible *** . . . and that the visible system isnot the whole universe but only, it may be, a very small part of it.\"Furthermore, looking back as well as forward to the origin of this visibleuniverse, the authors urge that \"if the visible universe is all that exists thenthe first abrupt manifestation of it is as truly a break of continuity as itsfinal overthrow\" (Art. 85). Therefore, as such a break is against the acceptedlaw of continuity, the authors come to the following conclusion: -- \"Now, is it not natural to imagine, that a universe of this nature, which wehave reason to think exists, and is connected by bonds of energy with thevisible universe, is also capable of receiving energy from it? . . . May we notregard Ether, or the medium, as not merely a bridge **** between one order ofthings and another, forming as it were a species of cement, in virtue of whichthe various orders of the universe are welded together and made into one? Infine, what we generally called Ether, may be not a mere medium, but a mediumplus the invisible order of things, so that when the motions of the visibleuniverse are transferred into Ether, part of them are conveyed as by a bridgeinto the invisible universe, and are there made use of and stored up. Nay, is iteven necessary to retain the conception of a bridge? May we not at once say thatwhen energy is carried from matter into Ether, it is carried from the visibleinto the invisible; and that when it is carried from Ether to matter it iscarried from the invisible into the visible?\"--(Art. 198, Unseen Universe.) Precisely; and were Science to take a few more steps in that direction andfathom more seriously the \"hypothetical medium\" who knows but Tyndall'simpassable chasm between the physical processes of the brain and consciousness,might be--at least intellectually--passed with surprising ease and safety. So far back as 1856, a man considered a savant in his days--Dr. Jobard ofParis,--had certainly the same ideas as the authors of the Unseen Universe, onether, when he startled the press and the world of science by the followingdeclaration: \"I hold a discovery which frightens me. There are two kinds ofelectricity; one, brute and blind, is produced by the contact of metals andacids\"; (the gross purgation) . . . \"the other is intelligent and CLAIRVOYANT! .. . Electricity has bifurcated itself in the hands of Galvani, Nobili, andMatteuci. The brute force of the current has followed Jacobi, Bonelli, andMoncal, while the intellectual one was following Bois-Robert, Thilorier, and theChevalier Duplanty. The electric ball or globular electricity contains a thoughtwhich disobeys Newton and Mariotte to follow its own freaks. . . . We have, inthe annals of the Academy, thousands of proofs of the INTELLIGENCE of theelectric bolt . . . But I remark that I am permitting myself to becomeindiscreet. A little more and I should have disclosed to you the key which isabout to discover to us the universal spirit.\" * The foregoing, added to the wonderful confessions of science and what we havejust quoted from the Unseen Universe, throw an additional lustre on the wisdomof the long departed ages. In one of the preceding chapters we have alluded to aquotation from Cory's translation of Ancient Fragments, in which it appears thatone of the Chaldean Oracles expresses this self-same idea about ether, and inlanguage singularly like that of the authors of the Unseen Universe. It statesthat from aether have come all things, and to it all will return; that theimages of all things are indelibly impressed upon it; and that it is thestore-house of the germs or of the remains of all visible forms, and even ideas.It appears as if this case strangely corroborates our assertion that whateverdiscoveries may be made in our days will be found to have been anticipated bymany thousand years by our \"simple-minded ancestors.\" At the point at which we are now arrived, the attitude assumed by thematerialists toward psychical phenomena being perfectly defined, we may assertwith safety that were this key lying loose on the threshold of the \"chasm\" notone of our Tyndalls would stoop to pick it up. How timid would appear to some kabalists these tentative efforts to solve theGREAT MYSTERY of the universal ether! although so far in advance of anythingpropounded by cotemporary philosophers, what the intelligent explorers of theUnseen Universe speculate upon, was to the masters of hermetic philosophyfamiliar science. To them ether was not merely a bridge connecting the seen andunseen sides of the universe, but across its span their daring feet followed theroad that led through the mysterious gates which modern speculators either willnot or cannot unlock. The deeper the research of the modern explorer, the more often he comes face toface with the discoveries of the ancients. Does Elie de Beaumont, the greatFrench geologist, venture a hint upon the terrestrial circulation, in relationto some elements in the earth's crust, he finds himself anticipated by the oldphilosophers. Do we demand of distinguished technologists, what are the mostrecent discoveries in regard to the origin of the metalliferous deposits? Wehear one of them, Professor Sterry Hunt, in showing us how water is a universalsolvent, enunciating the doctrine held and taught by the old Thales, more thantwo dozen centuries ago, that water was the principle of all things. We listento the same professor, with de Beaumont as authority, expounding the terrestrialcirculation, and the chemical and physical phenomena of the material world.While we read with pleasure that he is \"not prepared to concede that we have inchemical and physical processes the whole secret of organic life,\" we note witha still greater delight the following honest confession on his part: \"Still weare, in many respects, approximating the phenomena of the organic world to thoseof the mineral kingdom; and we at the same time learn that these so far interestand depend upon each other that we begin to see a certain truth underlying thenotion of those old philosophers, who extended to the mineral world the notionof a vital force, which led them to speak of the earth as a great livingorganism, and to look upon the various changes of its air, its waters, and itsrocky depths, as processes belonging to the life of our planet.\" Everything in this world must have a beginning. Things have latterly gone so farwith scientists in the matter of prejudice, that it is quite a wonder that evenso much as this should be conceded to ancient philosophy. The poor, honestprimordial elements have long been exiled, and our ambitious men of science runraces to determine who shall add one more to the fledgling brood of thesixty-three or more elementary substances. Meanwhile there rages a war in modernchemistry about terms. We are denied the right to call these substances\"chemical elements,\" for they are not \"primordial principles or self-existingessences out of which the universe was fashioned.\" * Such ideas associated withthe word element were good enough for the \"old Greek philosophy,\" but modernscience rejects them; for, as Professor Cooke says, \"they are unfortunateterms,\" and experimental science will have \"nothing to do with any kind ofessences except those which it can see, smell, or taste.\" It must have thosethat can be put in the eye, the nose, or the mouth! It leaves others to themetaphysicians. Therefore, when Van Helmont tells us that, \"though a homogeneal part ofelementary earth may be artfully (artificially) converted into water,\" though hestill denies \"that the same can be done by nature alone; for no natural agent isable to transmute one element into another,\" offering as a reason that theelements always remain the same, we must believe him, if not quite an ignoramus,at least an unprogressed disciple of the mouldy \"old Greek philosophy.\" Livingand dying in blissful ignorance of the future sixty-three substances, what couldeither he or his old master, Paracelsus, achieve? Nothing, of course, butmetaphysical and crazy speculations, clothed in a meaningless jargon common toall mediaeval and ancient alchemists. Nevertheless, in comparing notes, we findin the latest of all works upon modern chemistry, the following: \"The study ofchemistry has revealed a remarkable class of substances, from no one of which asecond substance has ever been produced by any chemical process which weighsless than the original substance . . . by no chemical process whatever can weobtain from iron a substance weighing less than the metal used in itsproduction. In a word, we can extract from iron nothing but iron.\" ** Moreover,it appears, according to Professor Cooke, that \"seventy-five years ago men didnot know there was any difference\" between elementary and compound substances,for in old times alchemists had never conceived \"that weight is the measure ofmaterial, and that, as thus measured, no material is ever lost; but, on thecontrary, they imagined that in such experiments *** as these the substancesinvolved underwent a mysterious transformation. . . . Centuries,\" in short,\"were wasted in vain attempts to transform the baser metals into gold.\" Is Professor Cooke, so eminent in modern chemistry, equally proficient in theknowledge of what the alchemists did or did not know? Is he quite sure that heunderstands the meaning of the alchemical diction? We are not. But let uscompare his views as above expressed with but sentences written in plain andgood, albeit old English, from the translations of Van Helmont and Paracelsus.We learn from their own admissions that the alkahest induces the followingchanges: \"(1.) The alkahest never destroys the seminal virtues of the bodies therebydissolved: for instance, gold, by its action, is reduced to a salt of gold,antimony to a salt of antimony, etc., of the same seminal virtues, or characterswith the original concrete. (2.) The subject exposed to its operation isconverted into its three principles, salt, sulphur, and mercury, and afterwardsinto salt alone, which then becomes volatile, and at length is wholly turnedinto clear water. (3.) Whatever it dissolves may be rendered volatile by asand-heat; and if, after volatilizing the solvent, it be distilled therefrom,the body is left pure, insipid water, but always equal in quantity to itsoriginal self.\" Further, we find Van Helmont, the elder, saying of this saltthat it will dissolve the most untractable bodies into substances of the sameseminal virtues, \"equal in weight to the matter dissolved\"; and he adds, \"Thissalt, by being several times cohobated with Paracelsus' sal circulatum, losesall its fixedness, and at length becomes an insipid water, equal in quantity tothe salt it was made from.\" * The objection that might be made by Professor Cooke, in behalf of modernscience, to the hermetic expressions, would equally apply to the Egyptianhieratic writings--they hide that which was meant to be concealed. If he wouldprofit by the labors of the past, he must employ the cryptographer, and not thesatirist. Paracelsus, like the rest, exhausted his ingenuity in transpositionsof letters and abbreviations of words and sentences. For example, when he wrotesutratur he meant tartar, and mutrin meant nitrum, and so on. There was no endto the pretended explanations of the meaning of the alkahest. Some imagined thatit was an alkaline of salt of tartar salatilized; others that it meant algeist,a German word which means all-spirit, or spirituous. Paracelsus usually termedsalt \"the centre of water wherein metals ought to die.\" This gave rise to themost absurd suppositions, and some persons--such as Glauber--thought that thealkahest was the spirit of salt. It requires no little hardihood to assert thatParacelsus and his colleagues were ignorant of the natures of elementary andcompound substances; they may not be called by the same names as are now infashion, but that they were known is proved by the results attained. Whatmatters it by what name the gas given off when iron is dissolved in sulphuricacid was called by Paracelsus, since he is recognized, even by our standardauthorities, as the discoverer of hydrogen? * His merit is the same; and thoughVan Helmont may have concealed, under the name \"seminal virtues,\" his knowledgeof the fact that elementary substances have their original properties, which theentering into compounds only temporarily modifies--never destroys--he was nonethe less the greatest chemist of his age, and the peer of modern scientists. Heaffirmed that the aurum potabile could be obtained with the alkahest, byconverting the whole body of gold into salt, retaining its seminal virtues, andbeing soluble in water. When chemists learn what he meant by aurum potabile,alkahest, salt, and seminal virtues--what he really meant, not what he said hemeant, nor what was thought he meant--then, and not before, can our chemistssafely assume such airs toward the fire-philosophers and those ancient masterswhose mystic teachings they reverently studied. One thing is clear, at any rate.Taken merely in its exoteric form, this language of Van Helmont shows that heunderstood the solubility of metallic substances in water, which Sterry Huntmakes the basis of his theory of metalliferous deposits. We would like to seewhat sort of terms would be invented by our scientific contemporaries to concealand yet half-reveal their audacious proposition that man's \"only God is thecineritious matter of his brain,\" if in the basement of the new Court House orthe cathedral on Fifth Avenue there were a torture-chamber, to which judge orcardinal could send them at will. Professor Sterry Hunt says in one of his lectures: ** \"The alchemists sought invain for a universal solvent; but we now know that water, aided in some cases byheat, pressure, and the presence of certain widely-distributed substances, suchas carbonic acid and alkaline carbonates and sulphides, will dissolve the mostinsoluble bodies; so that it may, after all, be looked upon as the long-soughtfor alkahest or universal menstruum.\" This reads almost like a paraphrase of Van Helmont, or Paracelsus himself! Theyknew the properties of water as a solvent as well as modern chemists, and whatis more, made no concealment of the fact; which shows that this was not theiruniversal solvent. Many commentaries and criticisms of their works are stillextant, and one can hardly take up a book on the subject without finding atleast one of their speculations of which they never thought of making a mystery.This is what we find in an old work on alchemists--a satire, moreover--of 1820,written at the beginning of our century when the new theories on the chemicalpotency of water were hardly in their embryonic state. \"It may throw some light to observe, that Van Helmont, as well as Paracelsus,took water for the universal instrument (agent?) of chymistry and naturalphilosophy; and earth for the unchangeable basis of all things--that fire wasassigned as the sufficient cause of all things--that Seminal impressions werelodged in the mechanism of the earth--that water, by dissolving and fermentingwith this earth, as it does by means of fire, brings forth everything; whenceoriginally proceeded animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms.\" * The alchemists understand well this universal potency of water. In the works ofParacelsus, Van Helmont, Philalethes, Pantatem, Tachenius, and even Boyle, \"thegreat characteristic of the alkahest,\" \"to dissolve and change all sublunarybodies--water alone excepted,\" is explicitly stated. And is it possible tobelieve that Van Helmont, whose private character was unimpeachable, and whosegreat learning was universally recognized, should most solemnly declare himselfpossessed of the secret, were it but a vain boast! ** In a recent address at Nashville, Tennessee, Professor Huxley laid down acertain rule with respect to the validity of human testimony as a basis ofhistory and science, which we are quite ready to apply to the present case. \"Itis impossible,\" he says, \"that one's practical life should not be more or lessinfluenced by the views which we may hold as to what has been the past historyof things. One of them is human testimony in its various shapes--all testimonyof eye-witnesses, traditional testimony from the lips of those who have beeneye-witnesses, and the testimony of those who have put their impressions intowriting and into print. . . . If you read Caesar's Commentaries, wherever hegives an account of his battles with the Gauls, you place a certain amount ofconfidence in his statements. You take his testimony upon this. You feel thatCaesar would not have made these statements unless he had believed them to betrue.\" Now, we cannot in logic permit Mr. Huxley's philosophical rule to be applied ina one-sided manner to Caesar. Either that personage was naturally truthful or anatural liar; and since Mr. Huxley has settled that point to his ownsatisfaction as regards the facts of military history in his favor, we insistthat Caesar is also a competent witness as to augurs, diviners, andpsychological facts. So with Herodotus, and all other ancient authorities,unless they were by nature men of truth, they should not be believed even aboutcivil or military affairs. Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. And equally, ifthey are credible as to physical things, they must be regarded as equally so asto spiritual things; for as Professor Huxley tells us, human nature was of oldjust as it is now. Men of intellect and conscience did not lie for the pleasureof bewildering or disgusting posterity. The probabilities of falsification by such men having been defined so clearly bya man of science, we feel free from the necessity of discussing the question inconnection with the names of Van Helmont and his illustrious but unfortunatemaster, the much-slandered Paracelsus. Deleuze, though finding in the works ofthe former many \"mythic, illusory ideas\"--perhaps only because he could notunderstand them--credits him nevertheless with a vast knowledge, \"an acutejudgment,\" and at the same time with having given to the world \"great truths.\"\"He was the first,\" he adds, \"to give the name of gas to aerial fluids. Withouthim it is probable that steel would have given no new impulse to science.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu005.htm#fn_275] By what application of thedoctrine of chances could we discover the likelihood that experimentalists,capable of resolving and recombining chemical substances, as they are admittedto have done, were ignorant of the nature of elementary substances, theircombining energies, and the solvent or solvents, that would disintegrate themwhen wanted? If they had the reputation only of theorists the case would standdifferently and our argument would lose its force, but the chemical discoveriesgrudgingly accorded to them, by their worst enemies, form the basis for muchstronger language than we have permitted ourselves, from a fear of being deemedover partial. And, as this work, moreover, is based on the idea that there is ahigher nature of man, that his moral and intellectual faculties should be judgedpsychologically, we do not hesitate to reaffirm that since Van Helmont asserted,\"most solemnly,\" that he was possessed of the secret of the alkahest, no moderncritic has a right to set him down as either a liar or a visionary, untilsomething more certain is known about the nature of this alleged universalmenstruum. \"Facts are stubborn things,\" remarks Mr. A. R. Wallace, in his preface toMiracles and Modern Spiritualism. Therefore, ** as facts must be our strongestallies, we will bring as many of these forward as the \"miracles\" of antiquityand those of our modern times will furnish us with. The authors of the UnseenUniverse have scientifically demonstrated the possibility of certain allegedpsychological phenomena through the medium of the universal ether. Mr. Wallacehas as scientifically proved that the whole catalogue of assumptions to thecontrary, including the sophisms of Hume, are untenable if brought face to facewith strict logic. Mr. Crookes has given to the world of skepticism his ownexperiments, which lasted above three years before he was conquered by the mostundeniable of evidence--that of his own senses. A whole list could be made up ofmen of science who have recorded their testimony to that effect; and CamilleFlammarion, the well-known French astronomer, and author of many works which, inthe eyes of the skeptical, should send him to the ranks of the \"deluded,\" incompany with Wallace, Crookes, and Hare, corroborates our words in the followinglines: \"I do not hesitate to affirm my conviction, based on a personal examination ofthe subject, that any scientific man who declares the phenomena denominated'magnetic,' 'somnambulic,' 'mediumic,' and others not yet explained by science,to be impossible, is one who speaks without knowing what he is talking about,and also any man accustomed, by his professional avocations, to scientificobservations--provided that his mind be not biassed by pre-conceived opinions,nor his mental vision blinded by that opposite kind of illusion, unhappily toocommon in the learned world, which consists in imagining that the laws of Natureare already known to us, and that everything which appears to overstep the limitof our present formulas is impossible, may require a radical and absolutecertainty of the reality of the facts alluded to.\" In Mr. Crookes' Notes of an Enquiry into the Phenomena called Spiritual, on p.101, this gentleman quotes Mr. Sergeant Cox, who having named this unknownforce, psychic, explains it thus: \"As the organism is itself moved and directedwithin the structure by a force--which either is, or is not controlled by--thesoul, spirit, or mind . . . which constitutes the individual being we term 'theman,' it is an equally reasonable conclusion that the force which causes themotions beyond the limits of the body is the same force that produces motionwithin the limits of the body. And, as the external force is often directed byintelligence, it is an equally reasonable conclusion that the directingintelligence of the external force is the same intelligence that directs theforce internally.\" In order to comprehend this theory the better, we may as well divide it in fourpropositions and show that Mr. Sergeant Cox believes: 1. That the force which produces physical phenomena proceeds from (consequentlyis generated in) the medium. 2. That the intelligence directing the force for the production of the phenomena(a) may sometimes be other than the intelligence of the medium; but of this the\"proof\" is \"insufficient\"; therefore, (b) the directing intelligence is probablythat of the medium himself. This Mr. Cox calls \"a reasonable conclusion.\" 3. He assumes that the force which moves the table is identical with the forcewhich moves the medium's body itself. 4. He strongly disputes the spiritualistic theory, or rather assertion, that\"spirits of the dead are the sole agents in the production of all thephenomena.\" Before we fairly proceed on our analysis of such views we must remind the readerthat we find ourselves placed between two extreme opposites represented by twoparties--the believers and unbelievers in this agency of human spirits. Neitherseem capable of deciding the point raised by Mr. Cox; for while thespiritualists are so omnivorous in their credulity as to believe every sound andmovement in a circle to be produced by disembodied human beings, theirantagonists dogmatically deny that anything can be produced by \"spirits,\" forthere are none. Hence, neither class is in a position to examine the subjectwithout bias. If they consider that force which \"produces motion within the body\" and the one\"which causes the motion beyond the limits of the body\" to be of the sameessence, they may be right. But the identity of these two forces stops here. Thelife-principle which animates Mr. Cox's body is of the same nature as that ofhis medium; nevertheless he is not the medium, nor is the latter Mr. Cox. This force, which, to please Mr. Cox and Mr. Crookes we may just as well callpsychic as anything else, proceeds through not from the individual medium. Inthe latter case this force would be generated in the medium and we are ready toshow that it cannot be so; neither in the instances of levitation of humanbodies, the moving of furniture and other objects without contact, nor in suchcases in which the force shows reason and intelligence. It is a well-known factto both mediums and spiritualists, that the more the former is passive, thebetter the manifestations; and every one of the above-mentioned phenomenarequires a conscious predetermined will. In cases of levitation, we should haveto believe that this self-generated force would raise the inert mass off theground, direct it through the air, and lower it down again, avoiding obstaclesand thereby showing intelligence, and still act automatically, the mediumremaining all the while passive. If such were the fact, the medium would be aconscious magician, and all pretense for being a passive instrument in the handsof invisible intelligences would become useless. As well plead that a quantityof steam sufficient to fill, without bursting, a boiler, will raise the boiler;or a Leyden jar, full of electricity, overcome the inertia of the jar, as such amechanical absurdity. All analogy would seem to indicate that the force whichoperates in the presence of a medium upon external objects comes from a sourceback of the medium himself. We may rather compare it with the hydrogen whichovercomes the inertia of the balloon. The gas, under the control of anintelligence, is accumulated in the receiver in sufficient volume to overcomethe attraction of its combined mass. On the same principle this force movesarticles of furniture, and performs other manifestations; and though identicalin its essence with the astral spirit of the medium, it cannot be his spiritonly, for the latter remains all the while in a kind of cataleptic torpor, whenthe mediumship is genuine. Mr. Cox's first point seems, therefore, not welltaken; it is based upon an hypothesis mechanically untenable. Of course ourargument proceeds upon the supposition that levitation is an observed fact. Thetheory of psychic force, to be perfect, must account for all \"visible motions .. . in solid substances,\" and among these is levitation. As to his second point, we deny that \"the proof is insufficient\" that the forcewhich produces the phenomena is sometimes directed by other intelligences thanthe mind of the \"psychic.\" On the contrary there is such an abundance oftestimony to show that the mind of the medium, in a majority of cases, hasnothing to do with the phenomena, that we cannot be content to let Mr. Cox'sbold assertion go unchallenged. Equally illogical do we conceive to be his third proposition; for if themedium's body be not the generator but simply the channel of the force whichproduces the phenomena--a question upon which Mr. Cox's researches throw nolight whatever--then it does not follow that because the medium's \"soul, spirit,or mind\" directs the medium's organism, therefore this \"soul, spirit, or mind,\"lifts a chair or raps at the call of the alphabet. As to the fourth proposition, namely, that \"spirits of the dead are the soleagents in the production of all the phenomena,\" we need not join issue at thepresent moment, inasmuch as the nature of the spirits producing mediumisticmanifestations is treated at length in other chapters. The philosophers, and especially those who were initiated into the Mysteries,held that the astral soul is the impalpable duplicate of the gross external formwhich we call body. It is the perisprit of the Kardecists and the spirit-form ofthe spiritualists. Above this internal duplicate, and illuminating it as thewarm ray of the sun illuminates the earth, fructifying the germ and calling outto spiritual vivification the latent qualities dormant in it, hovers the divinespirit. The astral perisprit is contained and confined within the physical bodyas ether in a bottle, or magnetism in magnetized iron. It is a centre and engineof force, fed from the universal supply of force, and moved by the same generallaws which pervade all nature and produce all cosmical phenomena. Its inherentactivity causes the incessant physical operations of the animal organism andultimately results in the destruction of the latter by overuse and its ownescape. It is the prisoner, not the voluntary tenant, of the body. It has anattraction so powerful to the external universal force, that after wearing outits casing it finally escapes to it. The stronger, grosser, more material itsencasing body, the longer is the term of its imprisonment. Some persons are bornwith organizations so exceptional, that the door which shuts other people infrom communication with the world of the astral light, can be easily unbarredand opened, and their souls can look into, or even pass into that world, andreturn again. Those who do this consciously, and at will, are termed magicians,hierophants, seers, adepts; those who are made to do it, either through thefluid of the mesmerizer or of \"spirits,\" are \"mediums.\" The astral soul, whenthe barriers are once opened, is so powerfully attracted by the universal,astral magnet, that it sometimes lifts its encasement with it and keeps itsuspended in mid-air, until the gravity of matter reasserts its supremacy, andthe body redescends again to earth. Every objective manifestation, whether it be the motion of a living limb, or themovement of some inorganic body, requires two conditions: will and force--plusmatter, or that which makes the object so moved visible to our eye; and thesethree are all convertible forces, or the force-correlation of the scientists. Intheir turn they are directed or rather overshadowed by the Divine intelligencewhich these men so studiously leave out of the account, but without which noteven the crawling of the smallest earth-worm could ever take place. The simplestas the most common of all natural phenomena,--the rustling of the leaves whichtremble under the gentle contact of the breeze--requires a constant exercise ofthese faculties. Scientists may well call them cosmic laws, immutable andunchangeable. Behind these laws we must search for the intelligent cause, whichonce having created and set these laws in motion, has infused into them theessence of its own consciousness. Whether we call this the first cause, theuniversal will, or God, it must always bear intelligence. And now we may ask, how can a will manifest itself intelligently andunconsciously at the same time? It is difficult, if not impossible, to conceiveof intellection apart from consciousness. By consciousness we do not necessarilyimply physical or corporeal consciousness. Consciousness is a quality of thesentient principle, or, in other words, the soul; and the latter often displaysactivity even while the body is asleep or paralyzed. When we lift our armmechanically, we may imagine that we do it unconsciously because our superficialsenses cannot appreciate the interval between the formulation of the purpose andits execution. Latent as it seemed to us, our vigilant will evolved force, andset our matter in motion. There is nothing in the nature of the most trivial ofmediumistic phenomena to make Mr. Cox's theory plausible. If the intelligencemanifested by this force is no proof that it belongs to a disembodied spirit,still less is it evidence that it is unconsciously given out by the medium; Mr.Crookes himself tells us of cases where the intelligence could not have emanatedfrom any one in the room; as in the instance where the word \"however,\" coveredby his finger and unknown even to himself, was correctly written byplanchette. * No explanation whatever can account for this case; the onlyhypothesis tenable--if we exclude the agency of a spirit-power--is that theclairvoyant faculties were brought into play. But scientists deny clairvoyance;and if, to escape the unwelcome alternative of accrediting the phenomena to aspiritual source, they concede to us the fact of clairvoyance, it then devolvesupon them to either accept the kabalistic explanation of what this faculty is,or achieve the task hitherto impracticable of making a new theory to fit thefacts. Again, if for the sake of argument it should be admitted that Mr. Crookes' word\"however\" might have been clairvoyantly read, what shall we say of mediumisticcommunications having a prophetic character? Does any theory of mediumisticimpulse account for the ability to foretell events beyond the possible knowledgeof both speaker and listener? Mr. Cox will have to try again. As we have said before, the modern psychic force, and the ancient oracularfluids, whether terrestrial or sidereal, are identical in essence--simply ablind force. So is air. And while in a dialogue the sound-waves produced by aconversation of the speakers affect the same body of air, that does not implyany doubt of the fact that there are two persons talking with each other. Is itany more reasonable to say that when a common agent is employed by medium and\"spirit\" to intercommunicate, there must necessarily be but one intelligencedisplaying itself? As the air is necessary for the mutual exchange of audiblesounds, so are certain currents of astral light, or ether directed by anIntelligence, necessary for the production of the phenomena called spiritual.Place two interlocutors in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, and, if theycould live, their words would remain inarticulate thoughts, for there would beno air to vibrate, and hence no ripple of sound would reach their ears. Placethe strongest medium in such isolating atmosphere as a powerful mesmerizer,familiar with the properties of the magical agent, can create around him, and nomanifestations will take place until some opposing intelligence, more potentialthan the will-power of the mesmerizer, overcomes the latter and terminates theastral inertia. The ancients were at no loss to discriminate between a blind force actingspontaneously and the same force when directed by an intelligence. Plutarch, the priest of Apollo, when speaking of the oracular vapors which werebut a subterranean gas, imbued with intoxicating magnetic properties, shows itsnature to be dual, when he addresses it in these words: \"And who art thou?without a God who creates and ripens thee; without a daemon [spirit] who, actingunder the orders of God, directs and governs thee; thou canst do nothing, thouart nothing but a vain breath.\" * Thus without the indwelling soul orintelligence, \"Psychic Force\" would be also but a \"vain breath.\" Aristotle maintains that this gas, or astral emanation, escaping from inside theearth, is the sole sufficient cause, acting from within outwardly for thevivification of every living being and plant upon the external crust. In answerto the skeptical negators of his century, Cicero, moved by a just wrath,exclaims: \"And what can be more divine than the exhalations of the earth, whichaffect the human soul so as to enable her to predict the future? And could thehand of time evaporate such a virtue? Do you suppose you are talking of somekind of wine or salted meat?\" ** Do modern experimentalists claim to be wiserthan Cicero, and say that this eternal force has evaporated, and that thesprings of prophecy are dry? All the prophets of old--inspired sensitives--were said to be uttering theirprophecies under the same conditions, either by the direct outward efflux of theastral emanation, or a sort of damp fluxion, rising from the earth. It is thisastral matter which serves as a temporary clothing of the souls who formthemselves in this light. Cornelius Agrippa expresses the same views as to thenature of these phantoms by describing it as moist or humid: \"In spirito turbidoHUMIDOQUE.\" *** Prophecies are delivered in two ways--consciously, by magicians who are able tolook into the astral light; and unconsciously, by those who act under what iscalled inspiration. To the latter class belonged and belong the Biblicalprophets and the modern trance-speakers. So familiar with this fact was Plato,that of such prophets he says: \"No man, when in his senses, attains prophetictruth and inspiration . . . but only when demented by some distemper orpossession . . .\" (by a daimonion or spirit). *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu005.htm#fn_281] \"Some persons call themprophets; they do not know that they are only repeaters . . . and are not to becalled prophets at all, but only transmitters of vision and prophecy,\"--he adds. In continuation of his argument, Mr. Cox says: \"The most ardent spiritualistspractically admit the existence of psychic force, under the very inappropriatename of magnetism (to which it has no affinity whatever), for they assert thatthe spirits of the dead can only do the acts attributed to them by using themagnetism (that is, the psychic force) of the mediums.\" ** Here, again, a misunderstanding arises in consequence of different names beingapplied to what may prove to be one and the same imponderable compound. Becauseelectricity did not become a science till the eighteenth century, no one willpresume to say that this force has not existed since the creation; moreover, weare prepared to prove that even the ancient Hebrews were acquainted with it.But, merely because exact science did not happen before 1819 to stumble over thediscovery which showed the intimate connection existing between magnetism andelectricity, it does not at all prevent these two agents being identical. If abar of iron can be endowed with magnetic properties, by passing a current ofvoltaic electricity over some conductor placed in a certain way close to thebar, why not accept, as a provisional theory, that a medium may also be aconductor, and nothing more, at a seance? Is it unscientific to say that theintelligence of \"psychic force,\" drawing currents of electricity from the wavesof the ether, and employing the medium as a conductor, develops and calls intoaction the latent magnetism with which the atmosphere of the seance-room issaturated, so as to produce the desired effects? The word magnetism is asappropriate as any other, until science gives us something more than a merelyhypothetical agent endowed with conjectural properties. \"The difference between the advocates of psychic force and the spiritualistsconsists in this,\" says Sergeant Cox, \"that we contend that there is as yetinsufficient proof of any other directing agent than the intelligence of themedium, and no proof whatever of the agency of the 'spirits' of the dead.\" *** We fully agree with Mr. Cox as to the lack of proof that the agency is that ofthe spirits of the dead; as for the rest, it is a very extraordinary deductionfrom \"a wealth of facts,\" according to the expression of Mr. Crookes, whoremarks further, \"On going over my notes, I find . . . such a superabundance ofevidence, so overwhelming a mass of testimony . . . that I could fill severalnumbers of the Quarterly.\" * Now some of these facts of an \"overwhelming evidence\" are as follows: 1st. Themovement of heavy bodies with contact, but without mechanical exertion. 2d. Thephenomena of percussive and other sounds. 3d. The alteration of weight ofbodies. 4th. Movements of heavy substances when at a distance from the medium.5th. The rising of tables and chairs off the ground, without contact with anyperson. 6th. THE LEVITATION OF HUMAN BEINGS. ** 7th. \"Luminous apparitions.\"Says Mr. Crookes, \"Under the strictest conditions, I have seen a solid self-luminous body, the size and nearly the shape of a turkey's egg, floatnoiselessly about the room, at one time higher than any one could reach ontiptoe, and then gently descend to the floor. It was visible for more than tenminutes, and before it faded away it struck the table three times with a soundlike that of a hard, solid body.\" *** (We must infer that the egg was of thesame nature as M. Babinet's meteor-cat, which is classified with other naturalphenomena in Arago's works.) 8th. The appearance of hands, either self-luminousor visible by ordinary light. 9th. \"Direct writing\" by these same luminoushands, detached, and evidently endowed with intelligence. (Psychic force?) 10th.\"Phantom-forms and faces.\" In this instance, the psychic force comes \"from acorner of the room\" as a \"phantom form,\" takes an accordeon in its hand, andthen glides about the room, playing the instrument; Home, the medium, being infull view at the time. **** The whole of the preceding Mr. Crookes witnessed andtested at his own house, and, having assured himself scientifically of thegenuineness of the phenomenon, reported it to the Royal Society. Was he welcomedas the discoverer of natural phenomena of a new and important character? Let thereader consult his work for the answer. In addition to these freaks played on human credulity by \"psychic force,\" Mr.Crookes gives another class of phenomena, which he terms \"special instances,\"which seem (?) to point to the agency of an exterior intelligence. * \"I have been,\" says Mr. Crookes, \"with Miss Fox when she has been writing amessage automatically to one person present, whilst a message to another person,on another subject, was being given alphabetically by means of 'raps,' and thewhole time she was conversing freely with a third person, on a subject totallydifferent from either. . . . During a seance with Mr. Home, a small lath movedacross the table to me, in the light, and delivered a message to me by tappingmy hand; I repeating the alphabet, and the lath tapping me at the right letters. . . being at a distance from Mr. Home's hands.\" The same lath, upon request ofMr. Crookes, gave him \"a telegraphic message through the Morse alphabet, by tapson my hand\" (the Morse code being quite unknown to any other person present, andbut imperfectly to himself), \"and,\" adds Mr. Crookes, \"it convinced me thatthere was a good Morse operator at the other end of the line, WHEREVER THATMIGHT BE.\" ** Would it be undignified in the present case to suggest that Mr.Cox should search for the operator in his private principality--Psychic Land?But the same lath does more and better. In full light in Mr. Crookes' room it isasked to give a message, \" . . . a pencil and some sheets of paper had beenlying on the centre of the table; presently the pencil rose on its point, andafter advancing by hesitating jerks to the paper, fell down. It then rose, andagain fell. . . . After three unsuccessful attempts, a small wooden lath\" (theMorse operator) \"which was lying near upon the table, slid towards the pencil,and rose a few inches from the table; the pencil rose again, and propping itselfagainst the lath, the two together made an effort to mark the paper. It fell,and then a joint effort was made again. After a third trial the lath gave it up,and moved back to its place; the pencil lay as it fell across the paper, and analphabetic message told us: \"We have tried to do as you asked, but our power isexhausted.\" *** The word our, as the joint intelligent efforts of the friendlylath and pencil, would make us think that there were two psychic forces present. In all this, is there any proof that the directing agent was \"the intelligenceof the medium\"? Is there not, on the contrary, every indication that themovements of the lath and pencil were directed by spirits \"of the dead,\" or atleast of those of some other unseen intelligent entities? Most certainly the word magnetism explains in this case as little as the termpsychic force; howbeit, there is more reason to use the former than the latter,if it were but for the simple fact that the transcendent magnetism or mesmerismproduces phenomena identical in effects with those of spiritualism. Thephenomenon of the enchanted circle of Baron Du Potet and Regazzoni, is ascontrary to the accepted laws of physiology as the rising of a table withoutcontact is to the laws of natural philosophy. As strong men have often found itimpossible to raise a small table weighing a few pounds, and broken it to piecesin the effort, so a dozen of experimenters, among them sometimes, academicians,were utterly unable to step across a chalk-line drawn on the floor by Du Potet.On one occasion a Russian general, well known for his skepticism, persisteduntil he fell on the ground in violent convulsions. In this case, the magneticfluid which opposed such a resistance was Mr. Cox's psychic force, which endowsthe tables with an extraordinary and supernatural weight. If they produce thesame psychological and physiological effects, there is good reason to believethem more or less identical. We do not think the deduction could be veryreasonably objected to. Besides, were the fact even denied, this is no reasonwhy it should not be so. Once upon a time, all the Academies in Christendom hadagreed to deny that there were any mountains in the moon; and there was acertain time when, if any one had been so bold as to affirm that there was lifein the superior regions of the atmosphere as well as in the fathomless depths ofthe ocean, he would have been set down as a fool or an ignoramus. \"The Devil affirms--it must be a lie!\" the pious Abbe Almiguana used to say, ina discussion with a \"spiritualized table.\" We will soon be warranted inparaphrasing the sentence and making it read--\"Scientists deny--then it must betrue.\" [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES163:* From a London Spiritualist journal. 164:* Hemmann: \"Medico-Surgical Essays,\" Berl., 1778. 165:* Robert Fludd: \"Treatise III.\" 165:** Prof. J.

Thou pleasing, dreadful thought!\"--ADDISON.\"There is another and a better world.\"--KOTZEBUE: The Stranger.AFTER according so much space to the conflicting opinions of our men of scienceabout certain occult phenomena of our modern period, it is but just that we giveattention to the speculations of mediaeval alchemists and certain otherillustrious men. Almost without exception, ancient and mediaeval scholarsbelieved in the arcane doctrines of wisdom. These included Alchemy, theChaldeo-Jewish Kabala, the esoteric systems of Pythagoras and the old Magi, andthose of the later Platonic philosophers and theurgists. We also propose insubsequent pages to treat of the Indian gymnosophists and the Chaldeanastrologers. We must not neglect to show the grand truths underlying themisunderstood religions of the past. The four elements of our fathers, earth,air, water, and fire, contain for the student of alchemy and ancientpsychology--or as it is now termed, magic--many things of which our philosophyhas never dreamed. We must not forget that what is now called Necromancy by theChurch, and Spiritualism by modern believers, and that includes the evoking ofdeparted spirits, is a science which has, from remote antiquity, been almostuniversally diffused over the face of the globe. Although neither an alchemist, magician, nor astrologer, but simply a greatphilosopher, Henry More, of Cambridge University--a man universally esteemed,may be named as a shrewd logician, scientist, and metaphysician. His belief inwitchcraft was firm throughout his life. His faith in immortality and ablearguments in demonstration of the survival of man's spirit after death are allbased on the Pythagorean system, adopted by Cardan, Van Helmont, and othermystics. The infinite and uncreated spirit that we usually call GOD, a substanceof the highest virtue and excellency, produced everything else by emanativecausality. God thus is the primary substance, the rest, the secondary; if theformer created matter with a power of moving itself, he, the primary substance,is still the cause of that motion as well as of the matter, and yet we rightlysay that it is matter which moves itself. \"We may define this kind of spirit wespeak of to be a substance indiscernible, that can move itself, that canpenetrate, contract, and dilate itself, and can also penetrate, move, and altermatter,\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu006.htm#fn_291] which is thethird emanation. He firmly believed in apparitions, and stoutly defended thetheory of the individuality of every soul in which \"personality, memory, andconscience will surely continue in the future state.\" He divided the astralspirit of man after its exit from the body into two distinct entities: the\"aerial\" and the \"aethereal vehicle.\" During the time that a disembodied manmoves in its aerial clothing, he is subject to Fate--i.e., evil and temptation,attached to its earthly interests, and therefore is not utterly pure; it is onlywhen he casts off this garb of the first spheres and becomes ethereal that hebecomes sure of his immortality. \"For what shadow can that body cast that is apure and transparent light, such as the ethereal vehicle is? And therefore thatoracle is then fulfilled, when the soul has ascended into that condition we havealready described, in which alone it is out of the reach of fate and mortality.\"He concludes his work by stating that this transcendent and divinely-purecondition was the only aim of the Pythagoreans. As to the skeptics of his age, his language is contemptuous and severe. Speakingof Scot, Adie, and Webster, he terms them \"our new inspired saints . . . swornadvocates of the witches, who thus madly and boldly, against all sense andreason, against all antiquity, all interpreters, and against the Scriptureitself, will have even no Samuel in the scene, but a confederate knave! Whetherthe Scripture, or these inblown buffoons, puffed up with nothing but ignorance,vanity, and stupid infidelity, are to be believed, let any one judge,\" headds. ** What kind of language would this eminent divine have used against our skepticsof the nineteenth century? Descartes, although a worshipper of matter, was one of the most devoted teachersof the magnetic doctrine and, in a certain sense, even of Alchemy. His system ofphysics was very much like that of other great philosophers. Space, which isinfinite, is composed, or rather filled up with a fluid and elementary matter,and is the sole fountain of all life, enclosing all the celestial globes andkeeping them in perpetual motion. The magnet-streams of Mesmer are disguised byhim into the Cartesian vortices, and both rest on the same principle. Ennemoserdoes not hesitate to say that both have more in common \"than people suppose, whohave not carefully examined the subject.\" * The esteemed philosopher, Pierre Poiret Naude, was the warmest defender of thedoctrines of occult magnetism and its first propounders, ** in 1679. Themagico-theosophical philosophy is fully vindicated in his works. The well-known Dr. Hufeland has written a work on magic *** in which hepropounds the theory of the universal magnetic sympathy between men, animals,plants, and even minerals. The testimony of Campanella, Van Helmont, andServius, is confirmed by him in relation to the sympathy existing between thedifferent parts of the body as well as between the parts of all organic and eveninorganic bodies. Such also was the doctrine of Tenzel Wirdig. It may even be found expounded inhis works, with far more clearness, logic, and vigor, than in those of othermystical authors who have treated of the same subject. In his famous treatise,The New Spiritual Medicine, he demonstrates, on the ground of the later-acceptedfact of universal attraction and repulsion--now called \"gravitation\"--that thewhole nature is ensouled. Wirdig calls this magnetic sympathy \"the accordance ofspirits.\" Everything is drawn to its like, and converges with natures congenialto itself. Out of this sympathy and antipathy arises a constant movement in thewhole world, and in all its parts, and uninterrupted communion between heavenand earth, which produces universal harmony. Everything lives and perishesthrough magnetism; one thing affects another one, even at great distances, andits \"congenitals\" may be influenced to health and disease by the power of thissympathy, at any time, and notwithstanding the intervening space. ****\"Hufeland,\" says Ennemoser, \"gives the account of a nose which had been cut fromthe back of a porter, but which, when the porter died, died too and fell offfrom its artificial position. A piece of skin,\" adds Hufeland, \"taken from aliving head, had its hair turn gray at the same time as that on the head fromwhich it was taken.\" ***** Kepler, the forerunner of Newton in many great truths, even in that of theuniversal \"gravitation\" which he very justly attributed to magnetic attraction,notwithstanding that he terms astrology \"the insane daughter of a most wisemother\"--Astronomy, shares the kabalistic belief that the spirits of the starsare so many \"intelligences.\" He firmly believes that each planet is the seat ofan intelligent principle, and that they are all inhabited by spiritual beings,who exercise influences over other beings inhabiting more gross and materialspheres than their own and especially our earth. * As Kepler's spiritual starryinfluences were superseded by the vortices of the more materialistic Descartes,whose atheistical tendencies did not prevent him from believing that he hadfound out a diet that would prolong his life five hundred years and more, so thevortices of the latter and his astronomical doctrines may some day give place tothe intelligent magnetic streams which are directed by the Anima Mundi. Baptista Porta, the learned Italian philosopher, notwithstanding his endeavorsto show to the world the groundlessness of their accusations of magic being asuperstition and sorcery, was treated by later critics with the same unfairnessas his colleagues. This celebrated alchemist left a work on Natural Magic, ** inwhich he bases all of the occult phenomena possible to man upon the world-soulwhich binds all with all. He shows that the astral light acts in harmony andsympathy with all nature; that it is the essence out of which our spirits areformed; and that by acting in unison with their parent-source, our siderealbodies are rendered capable of producing magic wonders. The whole secret dependson our knowledge of kindred elements. He believed in the philosopher's stone,\"of which the world hath so great an opinion of, which hath been bragged of inso many ages and happily attained unto by some.\" Finally, he throws out manyvaluable hints as to its \"spiritual meaning.\" In 1643, there appeared among themystics a monk, Father Kircher, who taught a complete philosophy of universalmagnetism. His numerous works *** embrace many of the subjects merely hinted atby Paracelsus. His definition of magnetism is very original, for he contradictedGilbert's theory that the earth was a great magnet. He asserted that althoughevery particle of matter, and even the intangible invisible \"powers\" weremagnetic, they did not themselves constitute a magnet. There is but one MAGNETin the universe, and from it proceeds the magnetization of everything existing.This magnet is of course what the kabalists term the central Spiritual Sun, orGod. The sun, moon, planets, and stars he affirmed are highly magnetic; but theyhave become so by induction from living in the universal magnetic fluid--theSpiritual light. He proves the mysterious sympathy existing between the bodiesof the three principal kingdoms of nature, and strengthens his argument by astupendous catalogue of instances. Many of these were verified by naturalists,but still more have remained unauthenticated; therefore, according to thetraditional policy and very equivocal logic of our scientists, they are denied.For instance, he shows a difference between mineral magnetism and zoomagnetism,or animal magnetism. He demonstrates it in the fact that except in the case ofthe lodestone all the minerals are magnetized by the higher potency, the animalmagnetism, while the latter enjoys it as the direct emanation from the firstcause--the Creator. A needle can be magnetized by simply being held in the handof a strong-willed man, and amber develops its powers more by the friction ofthe human hand than by any other object; therefore man can impart his own life,and, to a certain degree, animate inorganic objects. This, \"in the eyes of thefoolish, is sorcery.\" \"The sun is the most magnetic of all bodies,\" he says;thus anticipating the theory of General Pleasonton by more than two centuries.\"The ancient philosophers never denied the fact,\" he adds; \"but have at alltimes perceived that the sun's emanations were binding all things to itself, andthat it imparts this binding power to everything falling under its direct rays.\" As a proof of it he brings the instance of a number of plants being especiallyattracted to the sun, and others to the moon, and showing their irresistiblesympathy to the former by following its course in the heavens. The plant knownas the Githymal, * faithfully follows its sovereign, even when it is invisibleon account of the fog. The acacia uncloses its petals at its rising, and closesthem at its setting. So does the Egyptian lotos and the common sunflower. Thenightshade exhibits the same predilection for the moon. As examples of antipathies or sympathies among plants, he instances the aversionwhich the vine feels for the cabbage, and its fondness toward the olive-tree;the love of the ranunculus for the water-lily, and of the rue for the fig. Theantipathy which sometimes exists even among kindred substances is clearlydemonstrated in the case of the Mexican pomegranate, whose shoots, when cut topieces, repel each other with the \"most extraordinary ferocity.\" Kircher accounts for every feeling in human nature as results of changes in ourmagnetic condition. Anger, jealousy, friendship, love, and hatred, are allmodifications of the magnetic atmosphere which is developed in us and constantlyemanates from us. Love is one of the most variable, and therefore the aspects ofit are numberless. Spiritual love, that of a mother for her child, of an artistfor some particular art, love as pure friendship, are purely magneticmanifestations of sympathy in congenial natures. The magnetism of pure love isthe originator of every created thing. In its ordinary sense love between thesexes is electricity, and he calls it amor febris species, the fever of species.There are two kinds of magnetic attraction: sympathy and fascination; the oneholy and natural, the other evil and unnatural. To the latter, fascination, wemust attribute the power of the poisonous toad, which upon merely opening itsmouth, forces the passing reptile or insect to run into it to its destruction.The deer, as well as smaller animals, are attracted by the breath of the boa,and are made irresistibly to come within its reach. The electric fish, thetorpedo, repels the arm with a shock that for a time benumbs it. To exercisesuch a power for beneficent purposes, man requires three conditions: 1, nobilityof soul; 2, strong will and imaginative faculty; 3, a subject weaker than themagnetizer; otherwise he will resist. A man free from worldly incentives andsensuality, may cure in such a way the most \"incurable\" diseases, and his visionmay become clear and prophetic. A curious instance of the above-mentioned universal attraction between all thebodies of the planetary system and everything organic as well as inorganicpertaining to them, is found in a quaint old volume of the seventeenth century.It contains notes of travel and an official report to the King of France, by hisAmbassador, de la Loubere, upon what he has seen in the kingdom of Siam. \"AtSiam,\" he says, \"there are two species of fresh-water fish, which theyrespectively call pal-out and pla-cadi fish. Once salted and placed uncut(whole) in the pot, they are found to exactly follow the flux and reflux of thesea, growing higher and lower in the pot as the sea ebbs or flows.\" * De laLoubere experimented with this fish for a long time, together with a governmentengineer, named Vincent, and, therefore, vouches for the truth of thisassertion, which at first had been dismissed as an idle fable. So powerful isthis mysterious attraction that it affected the fishes even when their bodiesbecame totally rotten and fell to pieces. It is especially in the countries unblessed with civilization that we shouldseek for an explanation of the nature, and observe the effects of that subtilepower, which ancient philosophers called the \"world's soul.\" In the East only, and on the boundless tracts of unexplored Africa, will thestudent of psychology find abundant food for his truth-hungering soul. Thereason is obvious. The atmosphere in populous neighborhoods is badly vitiated bythe smoke and fumes of manufactories, steam-engines, railroads, and steamboats,and especially by the miasmatic exhalations of the living and the dead. Natureis as dependent as a human being upon conditions before she can work, and hermighty breathing, so to say, can be as easily interfered with, impeded, andarrested, and the correlation of her forces destroyed in a given spot, as thoughshe were a man. Not only climate, but also occult influences daily felt not onlymodify the physio-psychological nature of man, but even alter the constitutionof so-called inorganic matter in a degree not fairly realized by Europeanscience. Thus the London Medical and Surgical Journal advises surgeons not tocarry lancets to Calcutta, because it has been found by personal experience\"that English steel could not bear the atmosphere of India\"; so a bunch ofEnglish or American keys will be completely covered with rust twenty-four hoursafter having been brought to Egypt; while objects made of native steel in thosecountries remain unoxidized. So, too, it has been found that a Siberian Shamanwho has given stupendous proofs of his occult powers among his nativeTschuktschen, is gradually and often completely deprived of such powers whencoming into smoky and foggy London. Is the inner organism of man less sensitiveto climatic influences than a bit of steel? If not, then why should we castdoubt upon the testimony of travellers who may have seen the Shaman, day afterday, exhibit phenomena of the most astounding character in his native country,and deny the possibility of such powers and such phenomena, only because hecannot do as much in London or Paris? In his lecture on the Lost Arts, WendellPhillips proves that besides the psychological nature of man being affected by achange of climate, Oriental people have physical senses far more acute than theEuropeans. The French dyers of Lyons, whom no one can surpass in skill, he says,\"have a theory that there is a certain delicate shade of blue that Europeanscannot see. . . . And in Cashmere, where the girls make shawls worth $30,000,they will show him (the dyer of Lyons) three hundred distinct colors, which henot only cannot make, but cannot even distinguish.\" If there is such a vastdifference between the acuteness of the external senses of two races, why shouldthere not be the same in their psychological powers? Moreover, the eye of aCashmere girl is able to see objectively a color which does exist, but whichbeing inappreciable by the European, is therefore non-existent for him. Why thennot concede, that some peculiarly-endowed organisms, which are thought to bepossessed of that mysterious faculty called second sight, see their pictures asobjectively as the girl sees the colors; and that therefore the former, insteadof mere objective hallucinations called forth by imagination are, on thecontrary, reflections of real things and persons impressed upon the astralether, as explained by the old philosophy of the Chaldean Oracles, and surmisedby those modern discoverers, Babbage, Jevons, and the authors of the UnseenUniverse? \"Three spirits live and actuate man,\" teaches Paracelsus; \"three worlds pourtheir beams upon him; but all three only as the image and echo of one and thesame all-constructing and uniting principle of production. The first is thespirit of the elements (terrestrial body and vital force in its brutecondition); the second, the spirit of the stars (sidereal or astral body--thesoul); the third is the Divine spirit (Augoeides).\" Our human body, beingpossessed of \"primeval earth-stuff,\" as Paracelsus calls it, we may readilyaccept the tendency of modern scientific research \"to regard the processes ofboth animal and vegetable life as simply physical and chemical.\" This theoryonly the more corroborates the assertions of old philosophers and the MosaicBible, that from the dust of the ground our bodies were made, and to dust theywill return. But we must remember that \" 'Dust thou art, to dust returnest,'Was not spoken of the soul.\"Man is a little world--a microcosm inside the great universe. Like a foetus, heis suspended, by all his three spirits, in the matrix of the macrocosmos; andwhile his terrestrial body is in constant sympathy with its parent earth, hisastral soul lives in unison with the sidereal anima mundi. He is in it, as it isin him, for the world-pervading element fills all space, and is space itself,only shoreless and infinite. As to his third spirit, the divine, what is it butan infinitesimal ray, one of the countless radiations proceeding directly fromthe Highest Cause--the Spiritual Light of the World? This is the trinity oforganic and inorganic nature--the spiritual and the physical, which are three inone, and of which Proclus says that \"The first monad is the Eternal God; thesecond, eternity; the third, the paradigm, or pattern of the universe\"; thethree constituting the Intelligible Triad. Everything in this visible universeis the outflow of this Triad, and a microcosmic triad itself. And thus they movein majestic procession in the fields of eternity, around the spiritual sun, asin the heliocentric system the celestial bodies move round the visible suns. ThePythagorean Monad, which lives \"in solitude and darkness,\" may remain on thisearth forever invisible, impalpable, and undemonstrated by experimental science.Still the whole universe will be gravitating around it, as it did from the\"beginning of time,\" and with every second, man and atom approach nearer to thatsolemn moment in the eternity, when the Invisible Presence will become clear totheir spiritual sight. When every particle of matter, even the most sublimated,has been cast off from the last shape that forms the ultimate link of that chainof double evolution which, throughout millions of ages and successivetransformations, has pushed the entity onward; and when it shall find itselfreclothed in that primordial essence, identical with that of its Creator, thenthis once impalpable organic atom will have run its race, and the sons of Godwill once more \"shout for joy\" at the return of the pilgrim. \"Man,\" says Van Helmont, \"is the mirror of the universe, and his triple naturestands in relationship to all things.\" The will of the Creator, through whichall things were made and received their first impulse, is the property of everyliving being. Man, endowed with an additional spirituality, has the largestshare of it on this planet. It depends on the proportion of matter in himwhether he will exercise its magical faculty with more or less success. Sharingthis divine potency in common with every inorganic atom, he exercises it throughthe course of his whole life, whether consciously or otherwise. In the formercase, when in the full possession of his powers, he will be the master, and themagnale magnum (the universal soul) will be controlled and guided by him. In thecases of animals, plants, minerals, and even of the average of humanity, thisethereal fluid which pervades all things, finding no resistance, and being leftto itself, moves them as its impulse directs. Every created being in thissublunary sphere, is formed out of the magnale magnum, and is related to it. Manpossesses a double celestial power, and is allied to heaven. This power is \"notonly in the outer man, but to a degree also in the animals, and perhaps in allother things, as all things in the universe stand in a relation to each other;or, at least, God is in all things, as the ancients have observed it with aworthy correctness. It is necessary that the magic strength should be awakenedin the outer as well as in the inner man. . . . And if we call this a magicpower, the uninstructed only can be terrified by the expression. But, if youprefer it, you can call it a spiritual power--spirituale robur vocitaveris.There is, therefore, such magic power in the inner man. But, as there exists acertain relationship between the inner and the outer man, this strength must bediffused through the whole man.\" * In an extended description of the religious rites, monastic life, and\"superstitions\" of the Siamese, de la Loubere cites among other things thewonderful power possessed by the Talapoin (the monks, or the holy men of Buddha)over the wild beasts. \"The Talapoin of Siam,\" he says, \"will pass whole weeks inthe dense woods under a small awning of branches and palm leaves, and never makea fire in the night to scare away the wild beasts, as all other people do whotravel through the woods of this country.\" The people consider it a miracle thatno Talapoin is ever devoured. The tigers, elephants, and rhinoceroses--withwhich the neighborhood abounds--respect him; and travellers placed in secureambuscade have often seen these wild beasts lick the hands and feet of thesleeping Talapoin. \"They all use magic,\" adds the French gentleman, \"and thinkall nature animated (ensouled); * they believe in tutelar geniuses.\" But thatwhich seems to shock the author most is the idea which prevails among theSiamese, \"that all that man was in his bodily life, he will be after death.\"\"When the Tartar, which now reigns at China,\" remarks de la Loubere, \"wouldforce the Chinese to shave their hair after the Tartarian fashion, several ofthem chose rather to suffer death than to go, they said, into the other worldand appear before their ancestors without hair; imagining that they shaved thehead of the soul also!\" ** \"Now, what is altogether impertinent,\" adds theAmbassador, \"in this absurd opinion is, that the Orientals attribute the humanfigure rather than any other to the soul.\" Without enlightening his reader as tothe particular shape these benighted Orientals ought to select for theirdisembodied souls, de la Loubere proceeds to pour out his wrath on these\"savages.\" Finally, he attacks the memory of the old king of Siam, the father ofthe one to whose court he was sent, by accusing him of having foolishly spentover two million livres in search of the philosopher's stone. \"The Chinese,\" hesays, \"reputed so wise, have for three or four thousand years had the folly ofbelieving in the existence, and of seeking out a universal remedy by which theyhope to exempt themselves from the necessity of dying. They base themselves onsome foolish traditions, concerning some rare persons that are reported to havemade gold, and to have lived some ages; there are some very strongly establishedfacts among the Chinese, the Siamese, and other Orientals, concerning those thatknow how to render themselves immortal, either absolutely, or in such a mannerthat they can die no otherwise than by violent death. *** Wherefore, they namesome persons who have withdrawn themselves from the sight of men to enjoy freeand peaceable life. They relate wonders concerning the knowledge of thesepretended immortals.\" If Descartes, a Frenchman and a scientist, could, in the midst of civilization,firmly believe that such a universal remedy had been found, and that ifpossessed of it he could live at least five hundred years, why are not theOrientals entitled to the same belief? The master-problems of both life anddeath are still unsolved by occidental physiologists. Even sleep is a phenomenonabout whose cause there is a great divergence of opinion among them. How, then,can they pretend to set limits to the possible, and define the impossible? From the remotest ages the philosophers have maintained the singular power ofmusic over certain diseases, especially of the nervous class. Kircher recommendsit, having experienced its good effects in himself, and he gives an elaboratedescription of the instrument he employed. It was a harmonica composed of fivetumblers of a very thin glass, placed in a row. In two of them were twodifferent varieties of wine; in the third, brandy; in the fourth, oil; in thefifth, water. He extracted five melodious sounds from them in the usual way, bymerely rubbing his finger on the edges of the tumblers. The sound has anattractive property; it draws out disease, which streams out to encounter themusical wave, and the two, blending together, disappear in space. Asclepiadesemployed music for the same purpose, some twenty centuries ago; he blew atrumpet to cure sciatica, and its prolonged sound making the fibres of thenerves to palpitate, the pain invariably subsided. Democritus in like manneraffirmed that many diseases could be cured by the melodious sounds of a flute.Mesmer used this very harmonica described by Kircher for his magnetic cures. Thecelebrated Scotchman, Maxwell, offered to prove to various medical facultiesthat with certain magnetic means at his disposal, he would cure any of thediseases abandoned by them as incurable; such as epilepsy, impotence, insanity,lameness, dropsy, and the most obstinate fevers. * The familiar story of the exorcism of the \"evil spirit from God\" that obsessedSaul, will recur to every one in this connection. It is thus related: \"And itcame to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took anharp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and theevil spirit departed from him.\" ** Maxwell, in his Medicina Magnetica, expounds the following propositions, allwhich are the very doctrines of the alchemists and kabalists. \"That which men call the world-soul, is a life, as fire, spiritual, fleet,light, and ethereal as light itself. It is a life-spirit everywhere; andeverywhere the same. . . . All matter is destitute of action, except as it isensouled by this spirit. This spirit maintains all things in their peculiarcondition. It is found in nature free from all fetters; and he who understandshow to unite it with a harmonizing body, possesses a treasure which exceeds allriches.\" \"This spirit is the common bond of all quarters of the earth, and lives throughand in all--adest in mundo quid commune omnibus mextis, in quo ipsa permanent.\" \"He who knows this universal life-spirit and its application can prevent allinjuries.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu006.htm#fn_309] \"If thou canst avail thyself of this spirit and fix it on some particular bodythou wilt perform the mystery of magic.\" \"He who knows how to operate on men by this universal spirit, can heal, and thisat any distance that he pleases.\" ** \"He who can invigorate the particular spirit through the universal one, mightcontinue his life to eternity.\" *** \"There is a blending together of spirits, or of emanations, even when they arefar separated from each other. And what is this blending together? It is aneternal and incessant outpouring of the rays of one body into another.\" \"In the meantime,\" says Maxwell, \"it is not without danger to treat of this.Many abominable abuses of this may take place.\" And now let us see what are these abuses of mesmeric and magnetic powers in somehealing mediums. Healing, to deserve the name, requires either faith in the patient, or robusthealth united with a strong will, in the operator. With expectancy supplementedby faith, one can cure himself of almost any morbific condition. The tomb of asaint; a holy relic; a talisman; a bit of paper or a garment that has beenhandled by the supposed healer; a nostrum; a penance, or a ceremonial; thelaying on of hands, or a few words impressively pronounced--either will do. Itis a question of temperament, imagination, self-cure. In thousands of instances,the doctor, the priest, or the relic has had credit for healings that weresolely and simply due to the patient's unconscious will. The woman with thebloody issue who pressed through the throng to touch the robe of Jesus, was toldthat her \"faith\" had made her whole. The influence of mind over the body is so powerful that it has effected miraclesat all ages. \"How many unhoped-for, sudden, and prodigious cures have been effected byimagination,\" says Salverte. \"Our medical books are filled with facts of thisnature which would easily pass for miracles.\" **** But, if the patient has no faith, what then? If he is physically negative andreceptive, and the healer strong, healthy, positive, determined, the disease maybe extirpated by the imperative will of the operator, which, consciously orunconsciously, draws to and reinforces itself with the universal spirit ofnature, and restores the disturbed equilibrium of the patient's aura. He mayemploy as an auxiliary, a crucifix--as Gassner did; or impose the hands and\"will,\" like the French Zouave Jacob, like our celebrated American, Newton, thehealer of many thousands of sufferers, and like many others; or like Jesus, andsome apostles, he may cure by the word of command. The process in each case isthe same. In all these instances, the cure is radical and real, and without secondaryill-effects. But, when one who is himself physically diseased, attempts healing,he not only fails of that, but often imparts his illness to his patient, androbs him of what strength he may have. The decrepit King David reinforced hisfailing vigor with the healthy magnetism of the young Abishag; * and the medicalworks tell us of an aged lady of Bath, England, who broke down the constitutionsof two maids in succession, in the same way. The old sages, and Paracelsus also,removed disease by applying a healthy organism to the afflicted part, and in theworks of the above-said fire-philosopher, their theory is boldly andcategorically set forth. If a diseased person--medium or not--attempts to heal,his force may be sufficiently robust to displace the disease, to disturb it inthe present place, and cause it to shift to another, where shortly it willappear; the patient, meanwhile, thinking himself cured. But, what if the healer be morally diseased? The consequences may be infinitelymore mischievous; for it is easier to cure a bodily disease than cleanse aconstitution infected with moral turpitude. The mystery of Morzine, Cevennes,and that of the Jansenists, is still as great a mystery for physiologists as forpsychologists. If the gift of prophecy, as well as hysteria and convulsions, canbe imparted by \"infection,\" why not every vice? The healer, in such a case,conveys to his patient--who is now his victim--the moral poison that infects hisown mind and heart. His magnetic touch is defilement; his glance, profanation.Against this insidious taint, there is no protection for the passively-receptivesubject. The healer holds him under his power, spell-bound and powerless, as theserpent holds a poor, weak bird. The evil that one such \"healing medium\" caneffect is incalculably great; and such healers there are by the hundred. But, as we have said before, there are real and God-like healers, who,notwithstanding all the malice and skepticism of their bigoted opponents, havebecome famous in the world's history. Such are the Cure d'Ars, of Lyons, Jacob,and Newton. Such, also, were Gassner, the clergyman of Klorstele, and thewell-known Valentine Greatrakes, the ignorant and poor Irishman, who wasendorsed by the celebrated Robert Boyle, President of the Royal Society ofLondon, in 1670. In 1870, he would have been sent to Bedlam, in company withother healers, if another president of the same society had had the disposal ofthe case, or Professor Lankester would have \"summoned\" him under the Vagrant Actfor practicing upon Her Majesty's subjects \"by palmistry or otherwise.\" But, to close a list of witnesses which might be extended indefinitely, it willsuffice to say that, from first to last, from Pythagoras down to Eliphas Levi,from highest to humblest, every one teaches that the magical power is neverpossessed by those addicted to vicious indulgences. Only the pure in heart \"seeGod,\" or exercise divine gifts--only such can heal the ills of the body, andallow themselves, with relative security, to be guided by the \"invisiblepowers.\" Such only can give peace to the disturbed spirits of their brothers andsisters, for the healing waters come from no poisonous source; grapes do notgrow on thorns, and thistles bear no figs. But, for all this, \"magic has nothingsupernal in it\"; it is a science, and even the power of \"casting out devils\" wasa branch of it, of which the Initiates made a special study. \"That skill whichexpels demons out of human bodies, is a science useful and sanative to men,\"says Josephus. * The foregoing sketches are sufficient to show why we hold fast to the wisdom ofthe ages, in preference to any new theories that may have been hatched from theoccurrences of our later days, respecting the laws of intermundane intercourseand the occult powers of man. While phenomena of a physical nature may havetheir value as a means of arousing the interest of materialists, and confirming,if not wholly, at least inferentially, our belief in the survival of our soulsand spirits, it is questionable whether, under their present aspect, the modernphenomena are not doing more harm than good. Many minds, hungering after proofsof immortality, are fast falling into fanaticism; and, as Stow remarks,\"fanatics are governed rather by imagination than judgment.\" Undoubtedly, believers in the modern phenomena can claim for themselves adiversity of endowments, but the \"discerning of spirits\" is evidently absentfrom this catalogue of \"spiritual\" gifts. Speaking of the \"Diakka,\" whom he onefine morning had discovered in a shady corner of the \"Summer Land,\" A. J. Davis,the great American seer, remarks: \"A Diakka is one who takes insane delight inplaying parts, in juggling tricks, in personating opposite characters; to whomprayer and profane utterances are of equi-value; surcharged with a passion forlyrical narrations; . . . morally deficient, he is without the active feelingsof justice, philanthropy, or tender affection. He knows nothing of what men callthe sentiment of gratitude; the ends of hate and love are the same to him; hismotto is often fearful and terrible to others--SELF is the whole of privateliving, and exalted annihilation the end of all private life. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu006.htm#fn_315] Only yesterday, one saidto a lady medium, signing himself Swedenborg, this: 'Whatsoever is, has been,will be, or may be, that I AM; and private life is but the aggregative phantasmsof thinking throblets, rushing in their rising onward to the central heart ofeternal death!' \" ** Porphyry, whose works--to borrow the expression of an irritatedphenomenalist--\"are mouldering like every other antiquated trash in the closetsof oblivion,\" speaks thus of these Diakka--if such be their name--rediscoveredin the nineteenth century: \"It is with the direct help of these bad demons, thatevery kind of sorcery is accomplished . . . it is the result of theiroperations, and men who injure their fellow-creatures by enchantments, usuallypay great honors to these bad demons, and especially to their chief. Thesespirits pass their time in deceiving us, with a great display of cheap prodigiesand illusions; their ambition is to be taken for gods, and their leader demandsto be recognized as the supreme god.\" *** The spirit signing himself Swedenborg--just quoted from Davis's Diakka, andhinting that he is the I AM, singularly resembles this chief leader ofPorphyry's bad demons. What more natural than this vilification of the ancient and experiencedtheurgists by certain mediums, when we find Iamblichus, the expositor ofspiritualistic theurgy, strictly forbidding all endeavors to procure suchphenomenal manifestations; unless, after a long preparation of moral andphysical purification, and under the guidance of experienced theurgists. When,furthermore, he declares that, with very few exceptions, for a person \"to appearelongated or thicker, or be borne aloft in the air,\" is a sure mark of obsessionby bad demons. **** Everything in this world has its time, and truth, however based uponunimpeachable evidence, will not root or grow, unless, like a plant, it isthrown into soil in its proper season. \"The age must be prepared,\" saysProfessor Cooke; and some thirty years ago this humble work would have beendoomed to self-destruction by its own contents. But the modern phenomenon,notwithstanding the daily exposes, the ridicule with which it is crowned at thehand of every materialist, and its own numerous errors, grows and waxes strongin facts, if not in wisdom and spirit. What would have appeared twenty years agosimply preposterous, may well be listened to now that the phenomena are endorsedby great scientists. Unfortunately, if the manifestations increase in powerdaily, there is no corresponding improvement in philosophy. The discernment ofspirits is still as wanting as ever. Perhaps, among the whole body of spiritualist writers of our day, not one isheld in higher esteem for character, education, sincerity, and ability, thanEpes Sargent, of Boston, Massachusetts. His monograph entitled The ProofPalpable of Immortality, deservedly occupies a high rank among works upon thesubject. With every disposition to be charitable and apologetic for mediums andtheir phenomena, Mr. Sargent is still compelled to use the following language:\"The power of spirits to reproduce simulacra of persons who have passed from theearth-life, suggests the question--How far can we be assured of the identity ofany spirit, let the tests be what they may? We have not yet arrived at thatstage of enlightenment that would enable us to reply confidently to thisinquiry. . . . There is much that is yet a puzzle in the language and action ofthis class of materialized spirits.\" As to the intellectual calibre of most ofthe spirits which lurk behind the physical phenomena, Mr. Sargent willunquestionably be accepted as a most competent judge, and he says, \"the greatmajority, as in this world, are of the unintellectual sort.\" If it is a fairquestion, we would like to ask why they should be so lacking in intelligence, ifthey are human spirits? Either intelligent human spirits cannot materialize, or,the spirits that do materialize have not human intelligence, and, therefore, byMr. Sargent's own showing, they may just as well be \"elementary\" spirits, whohave ceased to be human altogether, or those demons, which, according to thePersian Magi and Plato, hold a middle rank between gods and disembodied men. There is good evidence, that of Mr. Crookes for one, to show that many\"materialized\" spirits talk in an audible voice. Now, we have shown, on thetestimony of ancients, that the voice of human spirits is not and cannot bearticulated; being, as Emanuel Swedenborg declares, \"a deep suspiration.\" Who ofthe two classes of witnesses may be trusted more safely? Is it the ancients whohad the experience of so many ages in theurgical practices, or modernspiritualists, who have had none at all, and who have no facts upon which tobase an opinion, except such as have been communicated by \"spirits,\" whoseidentity they have no means of proving? There are mediums whose organisms havecalled out sometimes hundreds of these would-be \"human\" forms. And yet we do notrecollect to have seen or heard of one expressing anything but the mostcommonplace ideas. This fact ought surely to arrest the attention of even themost uncritical spiritualist. If a spirit can speak at all, and if the way isopened to intelligent as well as to unintellectual beings, why should they notsometimes give us addresses in some remote degree approximating in quality tothe communications we receive through the \"direct writing\"? Mr. Sargent putsforward a very suggestive and important idea in this sentence. \"How far they arelimited in their mental operations and in their recollections by the act ofmaterialization, or how far by the intellectual horizon of the medium is still aquestion.\" * If the same kind of \"spirits\" materialize that produce the directwriting, and both manifest through mediums, and the one talk nonsense, while theother often give us sublime philosophical teachings, why should their mentaloperations be limited \"by the intellectual horizon of the medium\" in the oneinstance more than in the other? The materializing mediums--at least so far asour observation extends--are no more uneducated than many peasants and mechanicswho at different times have, under supernal influences, given profound andsublime ideas to the world. The history of psychology teems with examples inillustration of this point, among which that of Boehme, the inspired butignorant shoemaker, and our own Davis, are conspicuous. As to the matter ofunintellectuality we presume that no more striking cases need be sought thanthose of the child-prophets of Cevennes, poets and seers, such as have beenmentioned in previous chapters. When spirits have once furnished themselves withvocal organs to speak at all, it surely ought to be no more difficult for themto talk as persons of their assumed respective education, intelligence, andsocial rank would in life, instead of falling invariably into one monotonoustone of commonplace and, but too often, platitude. As to Mr. Sargent's hopefulremark, that \"the science of Spiritualism being still in its infancy, we mayhope for more light on this question,\" we fear we must reply, that it is notthrough \"dark cabinets\" that this light will ever break. ** It is simply ridiculous and absurd to require from every investigator who comesforward as a witness to the marvels of the day and psychological phenomena thediploma of a master of arts and sciences. The experience of the past forty yearsis an evidence that it is not always the minds which are the most\"scientifically trained\" that are the best in matters of simple common sense andhonest truth. Nothing blinds like fanaticism, or a one-sided view of a question.We may take as an illustration Oriental magic or ancient spiritualism, as wellas the modern phenomena. Hundreds, nay thousands of perfectly trustworthywitnesses, returning from residence and travels in the East, have testified tothe fact that uneducated fakirs, sheiks, dervishes, and lamas have, in theirpresence, without confederates or mechanical appliances, produced wonders. Theyhave affirmed that the phenomena exhibited by them were in contravention of allthe known laws of science, and thus tended to prove the existence of many yetunknown occult potencies in nature, seemingly directed by preterhumanintelligences. What has been the attitude assumed by our scientists toward thissubject? How far did the testimony of the most \"scientifically\" trained mindsmake impression on their own? Did the investigations of Professors Hare and deMorgan, of Crookes and Wallace, de Gasparin and Thury, Wagner and Butlerof,etc., shake for one moment their skepticism? How were the personal experiencesof Jacolliot with the fakirs of India received, or the psychologicalelucidations of Professor Perty, of Geneva, viewed? How far does the loud cry ofmankind, craving for palpable and demonstrated signs of a God, an individualsoul, and of eternity, affect them; and what is their response? They pull downand destroy every vestige of spiritual things, but they erect nothing. \"Wecannot get such signs with either retorts or crucibles,\" they say; \"hence, it'sall but a delusion!\" In this age of cold reason and prejudice, even the Churchhas to look to science for help. Creeds built on sand, and high-towering butrootless dogmas, crumble down under the cold breath of research, and pull downtrue religion in their fall. But the longing for some outward sign of a God anda life hereafter, remains as tenaciously as ever in the human heart. In vain isall sophistry of science; it can never stifle the voice of nature. Only herrepresentatives have poisoned the pure waters of simple faith, and now humanitymirrors itself in waters made turbid with all the mud stirred up from the bottomof the once pure spring. The anthropomorphic God of our fathers is replaced byanthropomorphic monsters; and what is still worse, by the reflection of humanityitself in these waters, whose ripples send it back the distorted images of truthand facts as evoked by its misguided imagination. \"It is not a miracle that wewant,\" writes the Reverend Brooke Herford, \"but to find palpable evidence of thespiritual and the divine. It is not to the prophets that men cry for such a'sign,' but rather to the scientists. Men feel as if all that groping about inthe foremost verge or innermost recesses of creation should bring theinvestigator at length close to the deep, underlying facts of all things, tosome unmistakable signs of God.\" The signs are there, and the scientists too;what can we expect more of them, now that they have done so well their duty?Have they not, these Titans of thought, dragged down God from His hiding-place,and given us instead a protoplasm? At the Edinburgh meeting of the British Association, in 1871, Sir WilliamThomson said: \"Science is bound by the everlasting law of honor to facefearlessly every problem which can fairly be presented to it.\" In his turn,Professor Huxley remarks: \"With regard to the miracle-question, I can only saythat the word 'impossible' is not, to my mind, applicable to matters ofphilosophy.\" The great Humboldt remarks that \"a presumptuous skepticism thatrejects facts without examination of their truth is, in some respects, moreinjurious than unquestioning credulity.\" These men have proved untrue to their own teachings. The opportunity affordedthem by the opening of the Orient, to investigate for themselves the phenomenaalleged by every traveller to take place in those countries, has been rejected.Did our physiologists and pathologists ever so much as think of availingthemselves of it to settle this most momentous subject of human thought? Oh, no;for they would never dare. It is not to be expected that the principalAcademicians of Europe and America should undertake a joint journey to Thibetand India, and investigate the fakir marvel on the spot! And were one of them togo as a solitary pilgrim and witness all the miracles of creation, in that landof wonders, who, of his colleagues, could be expected to believe his testimony? It would be as tedious as superfluous to begin a restatement of facts, soforcibly put by others, Mr. Wallace and W. Howitt, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu006.htm#fn_321] have repeatedly andcleverly described the thousand and one absurd errors into which the learnedsocieties of France and England have fallen, through their blind skepticism. IfCuvier could throw aside the fossil excavated in 1828 by Boue, the Frenchgeologist, only because the anatomist thought himself wiser than his colleague,and would not believe that human skeletons could be found eighty feet deep inthe mud of the Rhine; and if the French Academy could discredit the assertionsof Boucher de Perthes, in 1846, only to be criticised in its turn in 1860, whenthe truth of de Perthes' discoveries and observations was fully confirmed by thewhole body of geologists finding flint weapons in the drift-gravels of northernFrance; and if McEnery's testimony, in 1825, to the fact that he had discoveredworked flints, together with the remains of extinct animals, in Kent's HoleCavern ** was laughed at; and that of Godwin Austen to the same effect, in 1840,ridiculed still more, if that were possible; and all that excess of scientificskepticism and merriment could, in 1865, finally come to grief, and be shown tohave been entirely uncalled for; when--says Mr. Wallace \"all the previousreports for forty years were confirmed and shown to be even less wonderful thanthe reality;\"--who can be so credulous as to believe in the infallibility of ourscience? And why wonder at the exhibition of such a lack of moral courage inindividual members of this great and stubborn body known as modern science? Thus fact after fact has been discredited. From all sides we hear constantcomplaints. \"Very little is known of psychology!\" sighs one F. R. S. \"We mustconfess that we know little, if anything, in physiology,\" says another. \"Of allsciences, there is none which rests upon so uncertain a basis as medicine,\"reluctantly testifies a third. \"What do we know about the presumed nervousfluids? . . . Nothing, as yet,\" puts in a fourth one; and so on in every branchof science. And, meanwhile, phenomena, surpassing in interest all others ofnature, and to be solved only by physiology, psychology, and the \"as yetunknown\" fluids, are either rejected as delusions, or, if even true, \"do notinterest\" scientists. Or, what is still worse, when a subject, whose organismexhibits in itself the most important features of such occult though naturalpotencies, offers his person for an investigation, instead of an honestexperiment being attempted with him he finds himself entrapped by a scientist(?) and paid for his trouble with a sentence of three months' imprisonment! Thisis indeed promising. It is easy to comprehend that a fact given in 1731, testifying to another factwhich happened during the papacy of Paul III., for instance, is disbelieved in1876. And when scientists are told that the Romans preserved lights in theirsepulchres for countless years by the oiliness of gold; and that one of suchever-burning lamps was found brightly burning in the tomb of Tullia, thedaughter of Cicero, notwithstanding that the tomb had been shut up fifteenhundred and fifty years, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu006.htm#fn_323]--they have a certain rightto doubt, and even disbelieve the statement, until they assure themselves, onthe evidence of their own senses, that such a thing is possible. In such a casethey can reject the testimony of all the ancient and medieval philosophers. Theburial of living fakirs and their subsequent resuscitation, after thirty days ofinhumation, may have a suspicious look to them. So also with the self-inflictionof mortal wounds, and the exhibition of their own bowels to the persons presentby various lamas, who heal such wounds almost instantaneously. For certain men who deny the evidence of their own senses as to phenomenaproduced in their own country, and before numerous witnesses, the narratives tobe found in classical books, and in the notes of travellers, must of course seemabsurd. But what we will never be able to understand is the collectivestubbornness of the Academies, in the face of such bitter lessons in the past,to these institutions which have so often \"darkened counsel by words withoutknowledge.\" Like the Lord answering Job \"out of the whirlwind,\" magic can say tomodern science: \"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?declare, if thou hast understanding!\" And, who art thou who dare say to nature,\"Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves bestayed\"? But what matters it if they do deny? Can they prevent phenomena taking place inthe four corners of the world, if their skepticism were a thousand times morebitter? Fakirs will still be buried and resuscitated, gratifying the curiosityof European travellers; and lamas and Hindu ascetics will wound, mutilate, andeven disembowel themselves, and find themselves all the better for it; and thedenials of the whole world will not blow sufficiently to extinguish theperpetually-burning lamps in certain of the subterranean crypts of India,Thibet, and Japan. One of such lamps is mentioned by the Rev. S. Mateer, of theLondon Mission. In the temple of Trevandrum, in the kingdom of Travancore, SouthIndia, \"there is a deep well inside the temple, into which immense riches arethrown year by year, and in another place, in a hollow covered by a stone, agreat golden lamp, which was lit over 120 years ago, still continues burning,\"says this missionary in his description of the place. Catholic missionariesattribute these lamps, as a matter of course, to the obliging services of thedevil. The more prudent Protestant divine mentions the fact, and makes nocommentary. The Abbe Huc has seen and examined one of such lamps, and so haveother people whose good luck it has been to win the confidence and friendship ofEastern lamas and divines. No more can be denied the wonders seen by CaptainLane in Egypt; the Benares experiences of Jacolliot and those of Sir CharlesNapier; the levitations of human beings in broad daylight, and which can beaccounted for only on the explanation given in the Introductory chapter of thepresent work. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu006.htm#fn_324] Suchlevitations are testified to--besides Mr. Crookes--by Professor Perty, who showsthem produced in open air, and lasting sometimes twenty minutes; all thesephenomena and many more have happened, do, and will happen in every country ofthis globe, and that in spite of all the skeptics and scientists that ever wereevolved out of the Silurian mud. Among the ridiculed claims of alchemy is that of the perpetual lamps. If we tellthe reader that we have seen such, we may be asked--in case that the sincerityof our personal belief is not questioned--how we can tell that the lamps we haveobserved are perpetual, as the period of our observation was but limited? Simplythat, as we know the ingredients employed, and the manner of their construction,and the natural law applicable to the case, we are confident that our statementcan be corroborated upon investigation in the proper quarter. What that quarteris, and from whom that knowledge can be learned, our critics must discover, bytaking the pains we did. Meanwhile, however, we will quote a few of the 173authorities who have written upon the subject. None of these, as we recollect,have asserted that these sepulchral lamps would burn perpetually, but only foran indefinite number of years, and instances are recorded of their continuingalight for many centuries. It will not be denied that, if there is a natural lawby which a lamp can be made without replenishment to burn ten years, there is noreason why the same law could not cause the combustion to continue one hundredor one thousand years. Among the many well-known personages who firmly believed and strenuouslyasserted that such sepulchral lamps burned for several hundreds of years, andwould have continued to burn may be forever, had they not been extinguished, orthe vessels broken by some accident, we may reckon the following names: ClemensAlexandrinus, Hermolaus Barbarus, Appian, Burattinus, Citesius, Coelius, Foxius,Costaeus, Casalius, Cedrenus, Delrius, Ericius, Gesnerus, Jacobonus, Leander,Libavius, Lazius, P. della Mirandola, Philalethes, Licetus, Maiolus,Maturantius, Baptista Porta, Pancirollus, Ruscellius, Scardeonius, LudovicusVives, Volateranus, Paracelsus, several Arabian alchemists, and finally, Pliny,Solinus, Kircher, and Albertus Magnus. The discovery is claimed by the ancient Egyptians, those sons of the Land ofChemistry. * At least, they were a people who used these lamps far more than anyother nation, on account of their religious doctrines. The astral soul of themummy was believed to be lingering about the body for the whole space of thethree thousand years of the circle of necessity. Attached to it by a magneticthread, which could be broken but by its own exertion, the Egyptians hoped thatthe ever-burning lamp, symbol of their incorruptible and immortal spirit, wouldat last decide the more material soul to part with its earthly dwelling, andunite forever with its divine SELF. Therefore lamps were hung in the sepulchresof the rich. Such lamps are often found in the subterranean caves of the dead,and Licetus has written a large folio to prove that in his time, whenever asepulchre was opened, a burning lamp was found within the tomb, but wasinstantaneously extinguished on account of the desecration. T. Livius,Burattinus, and Michael Schatta, in their letters to Kircher, * affirm that theyfound many lamps in the subterranean caves of old Memphis. Pausanias speaks ofthe golden lamp in the temple of Minerva at Athens, which he says was theworkmanship of Callimachus, and burnt a whole year. Plutarch ** affirms that hesaw one in the temple of Jupiter Amun, and that the priests assured him that ithad burnt continually for years, and though it stood in the open air, neitherwind nor water could extinguish it. St. Augustine, the Catholic authority, alsodescribes a lamp in the fane of Venus, of the same nature as the others,unextinguishable either by the strongest wind or by water. A lamp was found atEdessa, says Kedrenus, \"which, being hidden at the top of a certain gate, burned500 years.\" But of all such lamps, the one mentioned by Olybius Maximus of Paduais by far the more wonderful. It was found near Atteste, and Scardeonius ***gives a glowing description of it: \"In a large earthen urn was contained alesser, and in that a burning lamp, which had continued so for 1500 years, bymeans of a most pure liquor contained in two bottles, one of gold and the otherof silver. These are in the custody of Franciscus Maturantius, and are by himvalued at an exceeding rate.\" Taking no account of exaggerations, and putting aside as mere unsupportednegation the affirmation by modern science of the impossibility of such lamps,we would ask whether, in case these inextinguishable fires are found to havereally existed in the ages of \"miracles,\" the lamps burning at Christian shrinesand those of Jupiter, Minerva, and other Pagan deities, ought to be differentlyregarded. According to certain theologians, it would appear that the former (forChristianity also claims such lamps) have burned by a divine, miraculous power,and that the light of the latter, made by \"heathen\" art, was supported by thewiles of the devil. Kircher and Licetus show that they were ordered in these twodiverse ways. The lamp at Antioch, which burned 1500 years, in an open andpublic place, over the door of a church, was preserved by the \"power of God,\"who \"hath made so infinite a number of stars to burn with perpetual light.\" Asto the Pagan lamps, St. Augustine assures us they were the work of the devil,\"who deceives us in a thousand ways.\" What more easy for Satan to do thanrepresent a flash of light, or a bright flame to them who first enter into sucha subterranean cave? This was asserted by all good Christians during the Papacyof Paul III., when upon opening a tomb in the Appian Way, at Rome, there wasfound the entire body of a young girl swimming in a bright liquor which had sowell preserved it, that the face was beautiful and like life itself. At her feetburned a lamp, whose flame vanished upon opening the sepulchre. From someengraved signs it was found to have been buried for over 1500 years, andsupposed to have been the body of Tulliola, or Tullia, Cicero's daughter. * Chemists and physicists deny that perpetual lamps are possible, alleging thatwhatever is resolved into vapor or smoke cannot be permanent, but must consume;and as the oily nutriment of a lighted lamp is exhaled into a vapor, hence thefire cannot be perpetual for want of food. Alchemists, on the other hand, denythat all the nourishment of kindled fire must of necessity be converted intovapor. They say that there are things in nature which will not only resist theforce of fire and remain inconsumable, but will also prove inextinguishable byeither wind or water. In an old chemical work of the year 1700, calledΝεκροκεδεια, the author gives a number of refutations of the claims of variousalchemists. But though he denies that a fire can be made to burn perpetually, heis half-inclined to believe it possible that a lamp should burn several hundredyears. Besides, we have a mass of testimony from alchemists who devoted years tothese experiments and came to the conclusion that it was possible. There are some peculiar preparations of gold, silver, and mercury; also ofnaphtha, petroleum, and other bituminous oils. Alchemists also name the oil ofcamphor and amber, the Lapis asbestos seu Amianthus, the Lapis Carystius,Cyprius, and Linum vivum seu Creteum, as employed for such lamps. They affirmthat such matter can be prepared either of gold or silver, reduced to fluid, andindicate that gold is the fittest pabulum for their wondrous flame, as, of allmetals, gold wastes the least when either heated or melted, and, moreover, canbe made to reabsorb its oily humidity as soon as exhaled, so continuouslyfeeding its own flame when it is once lighted. The Kabalists assert that thesecret was known to Moses, who had learned it from the Egyptians; and that thelamp ordered by the \"Lord\" to burn on the tabernacle, was an inextinguishablelamp. \"And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pureoil-olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always\" (Exod. xxvii.20). Licetus also denies that these lamps were prepared of metal, but on page 44 ofhis work mentions a preparation of quicksilver filtrated seven times throughwhite sand by fire, of which, he says, lamps were made that would burnperpetually. Both Maturantius and Citesius firmly believe that such a work canbe done by a purely chemical process. This liquor of quicksilver was known amongalchemists as Aqua Mercurialis, Materia Metallorum, Perpetua Dispositio, andMateria prima Artis, also Oleum Vitri. Tritenheim and Bartolomeo Korndorf bothmade preparations for the inextinguishable fire, and left their recipes forit. * Asbestos, which was known to the Greeks under the name of Ασβεστος, orinextinguishable, is a kind of stone, which once set on fire cannot be quenched,as Pliny and Solinus tell us. Albertus Magnus describes it as a stone of an ironcolor, found mostly in Arabia. It is generally found covered with ahardly-perceptible oleaginous moisture, which upon being approached with alighted candle will immediately catch fire. Many were the experiments made bychemists to extract from it this indissoluble oil, but they are alleged to haveall failed. But, are our chemists prepared to say that the above operation isutterly impracticable? If this oil could once be extracted there can be noquestion but it would afford a perpetual fuel. The ancients might well boast ofhaving had the secret of it, for, we repeat, there are experimenters living atthis day who have done so successfully. Chemists who have vainly tried it, haveasserted that the fluid or liquor chemically extracted from that stone was moreof a watery than oily nature, and so impure and feculent that it could not burn;others affirmed, on the contrary, that the oil, as soon as exposed to the air,became so thick and solid that it would hardly flow, and when lighted emitted noflame, but escaped in dark smoke; whereas the lamps of the ancients are allegedto have burned with the purest and brightest flame, without emitting theslightest smoke. Kircher, who shows the practicability of purifying it, thinksit so difficult as to be accessible only to the highest adepts of alchemy. St. Augustine, who attributes the whole of these arts to the Christianscapegoat, the devil, is flatly contradicted by Ludovicus Vives, * who showsthat all such would-be magical operations are the work of man's industry anddeep study of the hidden secrets of nature, wonderful and miraculous as they mayseem. Podocattarus, a Cypriote knight, ** had both flax and linen made out ofanother asbestos, which Porcacchius says *** he saw at the house of this knight.Pliny calls this flax linum vinum, and Indian flax, and says it is done out ofasbeston sive asbestinum, a kind of flax of which they made cloth that was to becleaned by throwing it in the fire. He adds that it was as precious as pearlsand diamonds, for not only was it very rarely found but exceedingly difficult tobe woven, on account of the shortness of the threads. Being beaten flat with ahammer, it is soaked in warm water, and when dried its filaments can be easilydivided into threads like flax and woven into cloth. Pliny asserts he has seensome towels made of it, and assisted in an experiment of purifying them by fire.Baptista Porta also states that he found the same, at Venice, in the hands of aCyprian lady; he calls this discovery of Alchemy a secretum optimum. Dr. Grew, in his description of the curiosities in Gresham College (seventeenthcentury), believes the art, as well as the use of such linen, altogether lost,but it appears that it was not quite so, for we find the Museum Septaliusboasting of the possession of thread, ropes, paper, and net-work done of thismaterial as late as 1726; some of these articles made, moreover, by the own handof Septalius, as we learn in Greenhill's Art of Embalming, p. 361. \"Grew,\" saysthe author, \"seems to make Asbestinus Lapis and Amianthus all one, and callsthem in English the thrum-stone\"; he says it grows in short threads or thrums,from about a quarter of an inch to an inch in length, parallel and glossy, asfine as those small, single threads the silk-worms spin, and very flexible liketo flax or tow. That the secret is not altogether lost is proved by the factthat some Buddhist convents in China and Thibet are in possession of it. Whethermade of the fibre of one or the other of such stones, we cannot say, but we haveseen in a monastery of female Talapoins, a yellow gown, such as the Buddhistmonks wear, thrown into a large pit, full of glowing coals, and taken out twohours afterward as clear as if it had been washed with soap and water. Similar severe trials of asbestos having occurred in Europe and America in ourown times, the substance is being applied to various industrial purposes, suchas roofing-cloth, incombustible dresses and fireproof safes. A very valuabledeposit on Staten Island, in New York harbor, yields the mineral in bundles,like dry wood, with fibres of several feet in length. The finer variety ofasbestos, called αμιαντος (undefiled) by the ancients, took its name from itswhite, satin-like lustre. The ancients made the wick of their perpetual lamps from another stone also,which they called Lapis Carystius. The inhabitants of the city of Carystosseemed to have made no secret of it, as Matthaeus Raderus says in his work *that they \"kemb'd, spun, and wove this downy stone into mantles, table-linen,and the like, which when foul they purified again with fire instead of water.\"Pausanias, in Atticus, and Plutarch ** also assert that the wicks of lamps weremade from this stone; but Plutarch adds that it was no more to be found in histime. Licetus is inclined to believe that the perpetual lamps used by theancients in their sepulchres had no wicks at all, as very few have been found;but Ludovicus Vives is of a contrary opinion and affirms that he has seen quitea number of them. Licetus, moreover, is firmly persuaded that a \"pabulum for fire may be givenwith such an equal temperament as cannot be consumed but after a long series ofages, and so that neither the matter shall exhale but strongly resist the fire,nor the fire consume the matter, but be restrained by it, as it were with achain, from flying upward.\" To this, Sir Thomas Browne, * speaking of lampswhich have burned many hundred years, included in small bodies, observes that\"this proceeds from the purity of the oil, which yields no fuliginousexhalations to suffocate the fire; for if air had nourished the flame, then ithad not continued many minutes, for it would certainly in that case have beenspent and wasted by the fire.\" But he adds, \"the art of preparing thisinconsumable oil is lost.\" Not quite; and time will prove it, though all that we now write should be doomedto fail, like so many other truths. We are told, in behalf of science, that she accepts no other mode ofinvestigation than observation and experiment. Agreed; and have we not therecords of say three thousand years of observation of facts going to prove theoccult powers of man? As to experiment, what better opportunity could have beenasked than the so-called modern phenomena have afforded? In 1869, variousscientific Englishmen were invited by the London Dialectical Society to assistin an investigation of these phenomena. Let us see what our philosophersreplied. Professor Huxley wrote: \"I have no time for such an inquiry, whichwould involve much trouble and (unless it were unlike all inquiries of that kindI have known) much annoyance. . . . I take no interest in the subject . . . butsupposing the phenomena to be genuine--they do not interest me.\" ** Mr. GeorgeH. Lewes expresses a wise thing in the following sentence: \"When any man saysthat phenomena are produced by no known physical laws, he declares he knows thelaws by which they are produced.\" *** Professor Tyndall expresses doubt as tothe possibility of good results at any seance which he might attend. Hispresence, according to the opinion of Mr. Varley, throws everything inconfusion. **** Professor Carpenter writes, \"I have satisfied myself by personalinvestigation, that, whilst a great number of what pass as such (i.e., spiritualmanifestations) are the results of intentional imposture, and many others ofself-deception, there are certain phenomena which are quite genuine, and must beconsidered as fair subjects of scientific study . . . the source of thesephenomena does not lie in any communication ab-extra, but depends upon thesubjective condition of the individual which operates according to certainrecognized physiological laws . . . the process to which I have given the name'unconscious cerebration' . . . performs a large part in the production of thephenomena known as spiritualistic.\" * And it is thus that the world is apprised through the organ of exact science,that unconscious cerebration has acquired the faculty of making the guitars flyin the air and forcing furniture to perform various clownish tricks! So much for the opinions of the English scientists. The Americans have not donemuch better. In 1857, a committee of Harvard University warned the publicagainst investigating this subject, which \"corrupts the morals and degrades theintellect.\" They called it, furthermore, \"a contaminating influence, whichsurely tends to lessen the truth of man and the purity of woman.\" Later, whenProfessor Robert Hare, the great chemist, defying the opinions of hiscontemporaries, investigated spiritualism, and became a believer, he wasimmediately declared non compos mentis; and in 1874, when one of the New Yorkdaily papers addressed a circular letter to the principal scientists of thiscountry, asking them to investigate, and offering to pay the expenses, they,like the guests bidden to the supper, \"with one consent, began to make excuses.\" Yet, despite the indifference of Huxley, the jocularity of Tyndall, and the\"unconscious cerebration\" of Carpenter, many a scientist as noted as either ofthem, has investigated the unwelcome subject, and, overwhelmed with theevidence, become converted. And another scientist, and a great author--althoughnot a spiritualist--bears this honorable testimony: \"That the spirits of thedead occasionally revisit the living, or haunt their former abodes, has been inall ages, in all European countries, a fixed belief, not confined to rustics,but participated in by the intelligent. . . . If human testimony on suchsubjects can be of any value, there is a body of evidence reaching from theremotest ages to the present time, as extensive and unimpeachable as is to befound in support of anything whatever.\" ** Unfortunately, human skepticism is a stronghold capable of defying any amount oftestimony. And to begin with Mr. Huxley, our men of science accept of but somuch as suits them, and no more. \"Oh shame to men! devil with devil damn'dFirm concord holds,--men only disagreeOf creatures rational. . . .\" ***How can we account for such divergence of views among men taught out of the sametext-books and deriving their knowledge from the same source? Clearly, this isbut one more corroboration of the truism that no two men see the same thingexactly alike. This idea is admirably formulated by Dr. J. J. Garth Wilkinson,in a letter to the Dialectical Society. \"I have long,\" says he, \"been convinced, by the experience of my life as apioneer in several heterodoxies which are rapidly becoming orthodoxies, thatnearly all truth is temperamental to us, or given in the affections andintuitions, and that discussion and inquiry do little more than feedtemperament.\" This profound observer might have added to his experience that of Bacon, whoremarks that \". . . a little philosophy inclineth a man's mind to atheism, butdepth in philosophy bringeth man's mind about to religion.\" Professor Carpenter vaunts the advanced philosophy of the present day which\"ignores no fact however strange that can be attested by valid evidence\"; andyet he would be the first to reject the claims of the ancients to philosophicaland scientific knowledge, although based upon evidence quite \"as valid\" as thatwhich supports the pretensions of men of our times to philosophical orscientific distinction. In the department of science, let us take for examplethe subjects of electricity and electro-magnetism, which have exalted the namesof Franklin and Morse to so high a place upon our roll of fame. Six centuriesbefore the Christian era, Thales is said to have discovered the electricproperties of amber; and yet the later researches of Schweigger, as given in hisextensive works on Symbolism, have thoroughly demonstrated that all the ancientmythologies were based on the science of natural philosophy, and show that themost occult properties of electricity and magnetism were known to the theurgistsof the earliest Mysteries recorded in history, those of Samothrace. Diodorus, ofSicily, Herodotus, and Sanchoniathon, the Phoenician--the oldest ofhistorians--tell us that these Mysteries originated in the night of time,centuries and probably thousands of years prior to the historical period. One ofthe best proofs of it we find in a most remarkable picture, in Raoul-Rochette'sMonuments d'Antiquite Figures, in which, like the \"erect-haired Pan,\" all thefigures have their hair streaming out in every direction--except the centralfigure of the Kabeirian Demeter, from whom the power issues, and one other, akneeling man. * The picture, according to Schweigger, evidently represents apart of the ceremony of initiation. And yet it is not so long since theelementary works on natural philosophy began to be ornamented with cuts ofelectrified heads, with hair standing out in all directions, under the influenceof the electric fluid. Schweigger shows that a lost natural philosophy ofantiquity was connected with the most important religious ceremonies. Hedemonstrates in the amplest manner, that magic in the prehistoric periods had apart in the mysteries and that the greatest phenomena, the so-calledmiracles--whether Pagan, Jewish, or Christian--rested in fact on the arcaneknowledge of the ancient priests of physics and all the branches of chemistry,or rather alchemy. In chapter xi., which is entirely devoted to the wonderful achievements of theancients, we propose to demonstrate our assertions more fully. We will show, onthe evidence of the most trustworthy classics, that at a period far anterior tothe siege of Troy, the learned priests of the sanctuaries were thoroughlyacquainted with electricity and even lightning-conductors. We will now add but afew more words before closing the subject. The theurgists so well understood the minutest properties of magnetism, that,without possessing the lost key to their arcana, but depending wholly upon whatwas known in their modern days of electro-magnetism, Schweigger and Ennemoserhave been able to trace the identity of the \"twin brothers,\" the Dioskuri, withthe polarity of electricity and magnetism. Symbolical myths, previously supposedto be meaningless fictions, are now found to be \"the cleverest and at the sametime most profound expressions of a strictly scientifically defined truth ofnature,\" according to Ennemoser. * Our physicists pride themselves on the achievements of our century and exchangeantiphonal hymns of praise. The eloquent diction of their class-lectures, theirflowery phraseology, require but a slight modification to change these lecturesinto melodious sonnets. Our modern Petrarchs, Dantes, and Torquato Tassos rivalwith the troubadours of old in poetical effusion. In their unboundedglorification of matter, they sing the amorous commingling of the wanderingatoms, and the loving interchange of protoplasms, and lament the coquettishfickleness of \"forces\" which play so provokingly at hide-and-seek with our graveprofessors in the great drama of life, called by them \"force-correlation.\"Proclaiming matter sole and autocratic sovereign of the Boundless Universe, theywould forcibly divorce her from her consort, and place the widowed queen on thegreat throne of nature made vacant by the exiled spirit. And now, they try tomake her appear as attractive as they can by incensing and worshipping at theshrine of their own building. Do they forget, or are they utterly unaware of thefact, that in the absence of its legitimate sovereign, this throne is but awhitened sepulchre, inside of which all is rottenness and corruption! Thatmatter without the spirit which vivifies it, and of which it is but the \"grosspurgation,\" to use a hermetic expression, is nothing but a soulless corpse,whose limbs, in order to be moved in predetermined directions, require anintelligent operator at the great galvanic battery called LIFE! In what particular is the knowledge of the present century so superior to thatof the ancients? When we say knowledge we do not mean that brilliant and cleardefinition of our modern scholars of particulars to the most trifling detail inevery branch of exact science; of that tuition which finds an appropriate termfor every detail insignificant and microscopic as it may be; a name for everynerve and artery in human and animal organisms, an appellation for every cell,filament, and rib in a plant; but the philosophical and ultimate expression ofevery truth in nature. The greatest ancient philosophers are accused of shallowness and asuperficiality of knowledge of those details in exact sciences of which themoderns boast so much. Plato is declared by his various commentators to havebeen utterly ignorant of the anatomy and functions of the human body; to haveknown nothing of the uses of the nerves to convey sensations; and to have hadnothing better to offer than vain speculations concerning physiologicalquestions. He has simply generalized the divisions of the human body, they say,and given nothing reminding us of anatomical facts. As to his own views on thehuman frame, the microcosmos being in his ideas the image in miniature of themacrocosmos, they are much too transcendental to be given the least attention byour exact and materialistic skeptics. The idea of this frame being, as well asthe universe, formed out of triangles, seems preposterously ridiculous toseveral of his translators. Alone of the latter, Professor Jowett, in hisintroduction to the Timaeus, honestly remarks that the modern physicalphilosopher \"hardly allows to his notions the merit of being 'the dead men'sbones' out of which he has himself risen to a higher knowledge\"; * forgettinghow much the metaphysics of olden times has helped the \"physical\" sciences ofthe present day. If, instead of quarrelling with the insufficiency and at timesabsence of terms and definitions strictly scientific in Plato's works, weanalyze them carefully, the Timaeus, alone, will be found to contain within itslimited space the germs of every new discovery. The circulation of the blood andthe law of gravitation are clearly mentioned, though the former fact, it may be,is not so clearly defined as to withstand the reiterated attacks of modernscience; for according to Prof. Jowett, the specific discovery that the bloodflows out at one side of the heart through the arteries, and returns through theveins at the other, was unknown to him, though Plato was perfectly aware \"thatblood is a fluid in constant motion.\" Plato's method, like that of geometry, was to descend from universals toparticulars. Modern science vainly seeks a first cause among the permutations ofmolecules; the former sought and found it amid the majestic sweep of worlds. Forhim it was enough to know the great scheme of creation and to be able to tracethe mightiest movements of the universe through their changes to theirultimates. The petty details, whose observation and classification have so taxedand demonstrated the patience of modern scientists, occupied but little of theattention of the old philosophers. Hence, while a fifth-form boy of an Englishschool can prate more learnedly about the little things of physical science thanPlato himself, yet, on the other hand, the dullest of Plato's disciples couldtell more about great cosmic laws and their mutual relations, and demonstrate afamiliarity with and control over the occult forces which lie behind them, thanthe most learned professor in the most distinguished academy of our day. This fact, so little appreciated and never dwelt upon by Plato's translators,accounts for the self-laudation in which we moderns indulge at the expense ofthat philosopher and his compeers. Their alleged mistakes in anatomy andphysiology are magnified to an inordinate extent to gratify our self-love,until, in acquiring the idea of our own superior learning, we lose sight of theintellectual splendor which adorns the ages of the past; it is as if one should,in fancy, magnify the solar spots until he should believe the bright luminary tobe totally eclipsed. The unprofitableness of modern scientific research is evinced in the fact thatwhile we have a name for the most trivial particle of mineral, plant, animal,and man, the wisest of our teachers are unable to tell us anything definiteabout the vital force which produces the changes in these several kingdoms. Itis necessary to seek further for corroboration of this statement than the worksof our highest scientific authorities themselves. It requires no little moral courage in a man of eminent professional position todo justice to the acquirements of the ancients, in the face of a publicsentiment which is content with nothing else than their abasement. When we meetwith a case of the kind we gladly lay a laurel at the feet of the bold andhonest scholar. Such is Professor Jowett, Master of Balliol College, and RegiusProfessor of Greek in the University of Oxford, who, in his translation ofPlato's works, speaking of \"the physical philosophy of the ancients as a whole,\"gives them the following credit: 1. \"That the nebular theory was the receivedbelief of the early physicists.\" Therefore it could not have rested, as Draperasserts, * upon the telescopic discovery made by Herschel I. 2. \"That thedevelopment of animals out of frogs who came to land, and of man out of theanimals, was held by Anaximenes in the sixth century before Christ.\" Theprofessor might have added that this theory antedated Anaximenes by somethousands of years, perhaps; that it was an accepted doctrine among Chaldeans,and that Darwin's evolution of species and monkey theory are of an antediluvianorigin. 3. \" . . . that, even by Philolaus and the early Pythagoreans, the earthwas held to be a body like the other stars revolving in space.\" ** Thus Galileo,studying some Pythagorean fragments, which are shown by Reuchlin to have yetexisted in the days of the Florentine mathematician; *** being, moreover,familiar with the doctrines of the old philosophers, but reasserted anastronomical doctrine which prevailed in India at the remotest antiquity. 4. Theancients \" . . . thought that there was a sex in plants as well as in animals.\"Thus our modern naturalists had but to follow in the steps of theirpredecessors. 5. \"That musical notes depended on the relative length or tensionof the strings from which they were emitted, and were measured by ratios ofnumber.\" 6. \"That mathematical laws pervaded the world and even qualitativedifferences were supposed to have their origin in number\"; and 7. \"Theannihilation of matter was denied by them, and held to be a transformationonly.\" **** \"Although one of these discoveries might have been supposed to be ahappy guess,\" adds Mr. Jowett, \"we can hardly attribute them all to merecoincidences.\" ***** In short, the Platonic philosophy was one of order, system, and proportion; itembraced the evolution of worlds and species, the correlation and conservationof energy, the transmutation of material form, the indestructibility of matterand of spirit. Their position in the latter respect being far in advance ofmodern science, and binding, the arch of their philosophical system with akeystone at once perfect and immovable. If science has made such colossalstrides during these latter days--if we have such clearer ideas of natural lawthan the ancients--why are our inquiries as to the nature and source of lifeunanswered? If the modern laboratory is so much richer in the fruits ofexperimental research than those of the olden time, how comes it that we make nostep except on paths that were trodden long before the Christian era? How doesit happen that the most advanced standpoint that has been reached in our timesonly enables us to see in the dim distance up the Alpine path of knowledge themonumental proofs that earlier explorers have left to mark the plateaux they hadreached and occupied? If modern masters are so much in advance of the old ones, why do they notrestore to us the lost arts of our postdiluvian forefathers? Why do they notgive us the unfading colors of Luxor--the Tyrian purple; the bright vermilionand dazzling blue which decorate the walls of this place, and are as bright ason the first day of their application? The indestructible cement of the pyramidsand of ancient aqueducts; the Damascus blade, which can be turned like acorkscrew in its scabbard without breaking; the gorgeous, unparalleled tints ofthe stained glass that is found amid the dust of old ruins and beams in thewindows of ancient cathedrals; and the secret of the true malleable glass? Andif chemistry is so little able to rival even with the early mediaeval ages insome arts, why boast of achievements which, according to strong probability,were perfectly known thousands of years ago? The more archaeology and philologyadvance, the more humiliating to our pride are the discoveries which are dailymade, the more glorious testimony do they bear in behalf of those who, perhapson account of the distance of their remote antiquity, have been until nowconsidered ignorant flounderers in the deepest mire of superstition. Why should we forget that, ages before the prow of the adventurous Genoese clovethe Western waters, the Phoenician vessels had circumnavigated the globe, andspread civilization in regions now silent and deserted? What archaeologist willdare assert that the same hand which planned the Pyramids of Egypt, Karnak, andthe thousand ruins now crumbling to oblivion on the sandy banks of the Nile, didnot erect the monumental Nagkon-Wat of Cambodia? or trace the hieroglyphics onthe obelisks and doors of the deserted Indian village, newly discovered inBritish Columbia by Lord Dufferin? or those on the ruins of Palenque and Uxmal,of Central America? Do not the relics we treasure in our museums--last mementosof the long \"lost arts\"--speak loudly in favor of ancient civilization? And dothey not prove, over and over again, that nations and continents that havepassed away have buried along with them arts and sciences, which neither thefirst crucible ever heated in a mediaeval cloister, nor the last cracked by amodern chemist have revived, nor will--at least, in the present century. \"They were not without some knowledge of optics,\" Professor Draper magnanimouslyconcedes to the ancients; others positively deny to them even that little. \"Theconvex lens found at Nimroud shows that they were not unacquainted withmagnifying instruments.\" * Indeed? If they were not, all the classical authorsmust have lied. For, when Cicero tells us that he had seen the entire Iliadwritten on skin of such a miniature size, that it could easily be rolled upinside a nut-shell, and Pliny asserts that Nero had a ring with a small glass init, through which he watched the performance of the gladiators at adistance--could audacity go farther? Truly, when we are told that Mauritiuscould see from the promontory of Sicily over the entire sea to the coast ofAfrica, with an instrument called nauscopite, we must either think that allthese witnesses lied, or that the ancients were more than slightly acquaintedwith optics and magnifying glasses. Wendell Phillips states that he has a friendwho possesses an extraordinary ring \"perhaps three-quarters of an inch indiameter, and on it is the naked figure of the god Hercules. By the aid ofglasses, you can distinguish the interlacing muscles, and count every separatehair on the eyebrows. . . . Rawlinson brought home a stone about twenty incheslong and ten wide, containing an entire treatise on mathematics. It would beperfectly illegible without glasses. . . . In Dr. Abbott's Museum, there is aring of Cheops, to which Bunsen assigns 500 B.C. The signet of the ring is aboutthe size of a quarter of a dollar, and the engraving is invisible without theaid of glasses. . . . At Parma, they will show you a gem once worn on the fingerof Michael Angelo, of which the engraving is 2,000 years old, and on which thereare the figures of seven women. You must have the aid of powerful glasses inorder to distinguish the forms at all. . . . So the microscope,\" adds thelearned lecturer, \"instead of dating from our time, finds its brothers in theBooks of Moses--and these are infant brothers.\" The foregoing facts do not seem to show that the ancients had merely \"someknowledge of optics.\" Therefore, totally disagreeing in this particular withProfessor Fiske and his criticism of Professor Draper's Conflict in his UnseenWorld, the only fault we find with the admirable book of Draper is that, as anhistorical critic, he sometimes uses his own optical instruments in the wrongplace. While, in order to magnify the atheism of the Pythagorean Bruno, he looksthrough convex lenses; whenever talking of the knowledge of the ancients, heevidently sees things through concave ones. It is simply worthy of admiration to follow in various modern works the cautiousattempts of both pious Christians and skeptical, albeit very learned men, todraw a line of demarcation between what we are and what we are not to believe,in ancient authors. No credit is ever allowed them without being followed by aqualifying caution. If Strabo tells us that ancient Nineveh was forty-sevenmiles in circumference, and his testimony is accepted, why should it beotherwise the moment he testifies to the accomplishment of Sibylline prophecies?Where is the common sense in calling Herodotus the \"Father of History,\" and thenaccusing him, in the same breath, of silly gibberish, whenever he recountsmarvellous manifestations, of which he was an eye-witness? Perhaps, after all,such a caution is more than ever necessary, now that our epoch has beenchristened the Century of Discovery. The disenchantment may prove too cruel forEurope. Gunpowder, which has long been thought an invention of Bacon andSchwartz, is now shown in the school-books to have been used by the Chinese forlevelling hills and blasting rocks, centuries before our era. \"In the Museum ofAlexandria,\" says Draper, \"there was a machine invented by Hero, themathematician, a little more than 100 years B.C. It revolved by the agency ofsteam, and was of the form that we should now call a reaction-engine. . . .Chance had nothing to do with the invention of the modern steam-engine.\" *Europe prides herself upon the discoveries of Copernicus and Galileo, and now weare told that the astronomical observations of the Chaldeans extend back towithin a hundred years of the flood; and Bunsen fixes the flood at not less than10,000 years before our era. ** Moreover, a Chinese emperor, more than 2,000years before the birth of Christ (i.e., before Moses) put to death his two chiefastronomers for not predicting an eclipse of the sun. It may be noted, as an example of the inaccuracy of current notions as to thescientific claims of the present century, that the discoveries of theindestructibility of matter and force-correlation, especially the latter, areheralded as among our crowning triumphs. It is \"the most important discovery ofthe present century,\" as Sir William Armstrong expressed it in his famousaddress as president of the British Association. But, this \"important discovery\"is no discovery after all. Its origin, apart from the undeniable traces of it tobe found among the old philosophers, is lost in the dense shadows of prehistoricdays. Its first vestiges are discovered in the dreamy speculations of Vedictheology, in the doctrine of emanation and absorption, the nirvana in short.John Erigena outlined it in his bold philosophy in the eighth century, and weinvite any one to read his De Divisione Naturae, who would convince himself ofthis truth. Science tells that when the theory of the indestructibility ofmatter (also a very, very old idea of Demokritus, by the way) was demonstrated,it became necessary to extend it to force. No material particle can ever belost; no part of the force existing in nature can vanish; hence, force waslikewise proved indestructible, and its various manifestations or forces, underdivers aspects, were shown to be mutually convertible, and but different modesof motion of the material particles. And thus was rediscovered theforce-correlation. Mr. Grove, so far back as 1842, gave to each of these forces,such as heat, electricity, magnetism, and light, the character ofconvertibility; making them capable of being at one moment a cause, and at thenext an effect. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu006.htm#fn_354] Butwhence come these forces, and whither do they go, when we lose sight of them? Onthis point science is silent. The theory of \"force-correlation,\" though it may be in the minds of ourcontemporaries \"the greatest discovery of the age,\" can account for neither thebeginning nor the end of one of such forces; neither can the theory point outthe cause of it. Forces may be convertible, and one may produce the other,still, no exact science is able to explain the alpha and omega of thephenomenon. In what particular are we then in advance of Plato who, discussingin the Timaeus the primary and secondary qualities of matter ** and thefeebleness of human intellect, makes Timaeus say: \"God knows the originalqualities of things; man can only hope to attain to probability.\" We have but toopen one of the several pamphlets of Huxley and Tyndall to find precisely thesame confession; but they improve upon Plato by not allowing even God to knowmore than themselves; and perhaps it may be upon this that they base theirclaims of superiority? The ancient Hindus founded their doctrine of emanationand absorption on precisely that law. The Το Ον, the primordial point in theboundless circle, \"whose circumference is nowhere, and the centre everywhere,\"emanating from itself all things, and manifesting them in the visible universeunder multifarious forms; the forms interchanging, commingling, and, after agradual transformation from the pure spirit (or the Buddhistic \"nothing\"), intothe grossest matter, beginning to recede and as gradually re-emerge into theirprimitive state, which is the absorption into Nirvana ***--what else is this butcorrelation of forces? Science tells us that heat may be shown to develop electricity, electricityproduce heat; and magnetism to evolve electricity, and vice versa. Motion, theytell us, results from motion itself, and so on, ad infinitum. This is the A B Cof occultism and of the earliest alchemists. The indestructibility of matter andforce being discovered and proved, the great problem of eternity is solved. Whatneed have we more of spirit? its uselessness is henceforth scientificallydemonstrated! Thus modern philosophers may be said not to have gone one step beyond what thepriests of Samothrace, the Hindus, and even the Christian Gnostics well knew.The former have shown it in that wonderfully ingenious mythos of the Dioskuri,or \"the sons of heaven\"; the twin brothers, spoken of by Schweigger, \"whoconstantly die and return to life together, while it is absolutely necessarythat one should die that the other may live.\" They knew as well as ourphysicists, that when a force has disappeared it has simply been converted intoanother force. Though archaeology may not have discovered any ancient apparatusfor such special conversions, it may nevertheless be affirmed with perfectreason and upon analogical deductions that nearly all the ancient religions werebased on such indestructibility of matter and force--plus the emanation of thewhole from an ethereal, spiritual fire--or the central sun, which is God orspirit, on the knowledge of whose potentiality is based ancient theurgic magic. In the manuscript commentary of Proclus on magic he gives the following account:\"In the same manner as lovers gradually advance from that beauty which isapparent in sensible forms, to that which is divine; so the ancient priests,when they considered that there is a certain alliance and sympathy in naturalthings to each other, and of things manifest to occult powers, and discoveredthat all things subsist in all, they fabricated a sacred science from thismutual sympathy and similarity. Thus they recognized things supreme in such asare subordinate, and the subordinate in the supreme; in the celestial regions,terrene properties subsisting in a causal and celestial manner; and in earthcelestial properties, but according to a terrene condition.\" Proclus then proceeds to point to certain mysterious peculiarities of plants,minerals, and animals, all of which are well known to our naturalists, but noneof which are explained. Such are the rotatory motion of the sunflower, of theheliotrope, of the lotos--which, before the rising of the sun, folds its leaves,drawing the petals within itself, so to say, then expands them gradually, as thesun rises, and draws them in again as it descends to the west--of the sun andlunar stones and the helioselenus, of the cock and lion, and other animals. \"Nowthe ancients,\" he says, \"having contemplated this mutual sympathy of things(celestial and terrestrial) applied them for occult purposes, both celestial andterrene natures, by means of which, through a certain similitude, they deduceddivine virtues into this inferior abode. . . . All things are full of divinenatures; terrestrial natures receiving the plenitude of such as are celestial,but celestial of supercelestial essences, while every order of things proceedsgradually in a beautiful descent from the highest to the lowest. * For whateverparticulars are collected into one above the order of things, are afterwardsdilated in descending, various souls being distributed under their variousruling divinities.\" ** Evidently Proclus does not advocate here simply a superstition, but science; fornotwithstanding that it is occult, and unknown to our scholars, who deny itspossibilities, magic is still a science. It is firmly and solely based on themysterious affinities existing between organic and inorganic bodies, the visibleproductions of the four kingdoms, and the invisible powers of the universe. Thatwhich science calls gravitation, the ancients and the mediaeval hermetistscalled magnetism, attraction, affinity. It is the universal law, which isunderstood by Plato and explained in Timaeus as the attraction of lesser bodiesto larger ones, and of similar bodies to similar, the latter exhibiting amagnetic power rather than following the law of gravitation. Theanti-Aristotelean formula that gravity causes all bodies to descend with equalrapidity, without reference to their weight, the difference being caused by someother unknown agency, would seem to point a great deal more forcibly tomagnetism than to gravitation, the former attracting rather in virtue of thesubstance than of the weight. A thorough familiarity with the occult facultiesof everything existing in nature, visible as well as invisible; their mutualrelations, attractions, and repulsions; the cause of these, traced to thespiritual principle which pervades and animates all things; the ability tofurnish the best conditions for this principle to manifest itself, in otherwords a profound and exhaustive knowledge of natural law--this was and is thebasis of magic. In his notes on Ghosts and Goblins, when reviewing some facts adduced by certainillustrious defenders of the spiritual phenomena, such as Professor de Morgan,Mr. Robert Dale Owen, and Mr. Wallace, among others--Mr. Richard A. Proctor saysthat he \"cannot see any force in the following remarks by Professor Wallace:'How is such evidence as this,' he (Wallace) says, speaking of one of Owen'sstories, 'refuted or explained away? Scores, and even hundreds, ofequally-attested facts are on record, but no attempt is made to explain them.They are simply ignored, and in many cases admitted to be inexplicable.' \" Tothis Mr. Proctor jocularly replies that as \"our philosophers declare that theyhave long ago decided these ghost stories to be all delusions; therefore theyneed only be ignored; and they feel much 'worritted' that fresh evidence shouldbe adduced, and fresh converts made, some of whom are so unreasonable as to askfor a new trial on the ground that the former verdict was contrary to theevidence.\" \"All this,\" he goes on to say, \"affords excellent reason why the 'converts'should not be ridiculed for their belief; but something more to the purpose mustbe urged before 'the philosophers' can be expected to devote much of their timeto the inquiry suggested. It ought to be shown that the well-being of the humanrace is to some important degree concerned in the matter, whereas the trivialnature of all ghostly conduct hitherto recorded is admitted even by converts!\" Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten has collected a great number of authenticated factsfrom secular and scientific journals, which show with what serious questions ourscientists sometimes replace the vexed subject of \"Ghosts and Goblins.\" Shequotes from a Washington paper a report of one of these solemn conclaves, heldon the evening of April 29th, 1854. Professor Hare, of Philadelphia, thevenerable chemist, who was so universally respected for his individualcharacter, as well as for his life-long labors for science, \"was bullied intosilence\" by Professor Henry, as soon as he had touched the subject ofspiritualism. \"The impertinent action of one of the members of the 'AmericanScientific Association,' \" says the authoress, \"was sanctioned by the majorityof that distinguished body and subsequently endorsed by all of them in theirproceedings.\" * On the following morning, in the report of the session, theSpiritual Telegraph thus commented upon the events: \"It would seem that a subject like this\"--(presented by Professor Hare) \"was onewhich would lie peculiarly within the domain of 'science.' But the 'AmericanAssociation for the Promotion of Science' ** decided that it was either unworthyof their attention or dangerous for them to meddle with, and so they voted toput the invitation on the table. . . . We cannot omit in this connection tomention that the 'American Association for the Promotion of Science' held a verylearned, extended, grave, and profound discussion at the same session, upon thecause why 'roosters crow between twelve and one o'clock at night!' \" A subjectworthy of philosophers; and one, moreover, which must have been shown to effect\"the well-being of the human race\" in a very \"important degree.\" It is sufficient for one to express belief in the existence of a mysterioussympathy between the life of certain plants and that of human beings, to assurebeing made the subject of ridicule. Nevertheless, there are manywell-authenticated cases going to show the reality of such an affinity. Personshave been known to fall sick simultaneously with the uprooting of a tree plantedupon their natal day, and dying when the tree died. Reversing affairs, it hasbeen known that a tree planted under the same circumstances withered and diedsimultaneously with the person whose twin brother, so to speak, it was. Theformer would be called by Mr. Proctor an \"effect of the imagination\"; the lattera \"curious coincidence.\" Max Muller gives a number of such cases in his essay On Manners and Customs. Heshows this popular tradition existing in Central America, in India, and Germany.He traces it over nearly all Europe; finds it among the Maori Warriors, inBritish Guiana, and in Asia. Reviewing Tyler's Researches into the Early Historyof Mankind, a work in which are brought together quite a number of suchtraditions, the great philologist very justly remarks the following: \"If itoccurred in Indian and German tales only, we might consider it as ancient Aryanproperty; but when we find it again in Central America, nothing remains buteither to admit a later communication between European settlers and nativeAmerican story-tellers . . . or to inquire whether there is not someintelligible and truly human element in this supposed sympathy between the lifeof flowers and the life of man.\" The present generation of men, who believe in nothing beyond the superficialevidence of their senses, will doubtless reject the very idea of such asympathetic power existing in plants, animals, and even stones. The caulcovering their inner sight allows them to see but that which they cannot welldeny. The author of the Asclepian Dialogue furnishes us with a reason for it,that might perhaps fit the present period and account for this epidemic ofunbelief. In our century, as then, \"there is a lamentable departure of divinityfrom man, when nothing worthy of heaven or celestial concerns is heard orbelieved, and when every divine voice is by a necessary silence dumb.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu006.htm#fn_361] Or, as the Emperor Julianhas it, \"the little soul\" of the skeptic \"is indeed acute, but sees nothing witha vision healthy and sound.\" We are at the bottom of a cycle and evidently in a transitory state. Platodivides the intellectual progress of the universe during every cycle intofertile and barren periods. In the sublunary regions, the spheres of the variouselements remain eternally in perfect harmony with the divine nature, he says;\"but their parts,\" owing to a too close proximity to earth, and theircommingling with the earthly (which is matter, and therefore the realm of evil),\"are sometimes according, and sometimes contrary to (divine) nature.\" When thosecirculations--which Eliphas Levi calls \"currents of the astral light\"--in theuniversal ether which contains in itself every element, take place in harmonywith the divine spirit, our earth and everything pertaining to it enjoys afertile period. The occult powers of plants, animals, and minerals magicallysympathize with the \"superior natures,\" and the divine soul of man is in perfectintelligence with these \"inferior\" ones. But during the barren periods, thelatter lose their magic sympathy, and the spiritual sight of the majority ofmankind is so blinded as to lose every notion of the superior powers of its owndivine spirit. We are in a barren period: the eighteenth century, during whichthe malignant fever of skepticism broke out so irrepressibly, has entailedunbelief as an hereditary disease upon the nineteenth. The divine intellect isveiled in man; his animal brain alone philosophizes. Formerly, magic was a universal science, entirely in the hands of the sacerdotalsavant. Though the focus was jealously guarded in the sanctuaries, its raysilluminated the whole of mankind. Otherwise, how are we to account for theextraordinary identity of \"superstitions,\" customs, traditions, and evensentences, repeated in popular proverbs so widely scattered from one pole to theother that we find exactly the same ideas among the Tartars and Laplanders asamong the southern nations of Europe, the inhabitants of the steppes of Russia,and the aborigines of North and South America? For instance, Tyler shows one ofthe ancient Pythagorean maxims, \"Do not stir the fire with a sword,\" as popularamong a number of nations which have not the slightest connection with eachother. He quotes De Plano Carpini, who found this tradition prevailing among theTartars so far back as in 1246. A Tartar will not consent for any amount ofmoney to stick a knife into the fire, or touch it with any sharp or pointedinstrument, for fear of cutting the \"head of the fire.\" The Kamtchadal of North-eastern Asia consider it a great sin so to do. The SiouxIndians of North America dare not touch the fire with either needle, knife, orany sharp instrument. The Kalmucks entertain the same dread; and an Abyssinianwould rather bury his bare arms to the elbows in blazing coals than use a knifeor axe near them. All these facts Tyler also calls \"simply curiouscoincidences.\" Max Muller, however, thinks that they lose much of their force bythe fact \"of the Pythagorean doctrine being at the bottom of it.\" Every sentence of Pythagoras, like most of the ancient maxims, has a dualsignification; and, while it had an occult physical meaning, expressed literallyin its words, it embodied a moral precept, which is explained by Iamblichus inhis Life of Pythagoras. This \"Dig not fire with a sword,\" is the ninth symbol inthe Protreptics of this Neo-platonist. \"This symbol,\" he says, \"exhorts toprudence.\" It shows \"the propriety of not opposing sharp words to a man full offire and wrath--not contending with him. For frequently by uncivil words youwill agitate and disturb an ignorant man, and you will suffer yourself. . . .Herakleitus also testifies to the truth of this symbol. For, he says, 'It isdifficult to fight with anger, for whatever is necessary to be done redeems thesoul.' And this he says truly. For many, by gratifying anger, have changed thecondition of their soul, and have made death preferable to life. But bygoverning the tongue and being quiet, friendship is produced from strife, thefire of anger being extinguished, and you yourself will not appear to bedestitute of intellect.\" * We have had misgivings sometimes; we have questioned the impartiality of our ownjudgment, our ability to offer a respectful criticism upon the labors of suchgiants as some of our modern philosophers--Tyndall, Huxley, Spencer, Carpenter,and a few others. In our immoderate love for the \"men of old\"--the primitivesages--we were always afraid to trespass the boundaries of justice and refusetheir dues to those who deserve them. Gradually this natural fear gave waybefore an unexpected reinforcement. We found out that we were but the feebleecho of public opinion, which, though suppressed, has sometimes found relief inable articles scattered throughout the periodicals of the country. One of suchcan be found in the National Quarterly Review of December, 1875, entitled \"OurSensational Present-Day Philosophers.\" It is a very able article, discussingfearlessly the claims of several of our scientists to new discoveries in regardto the nature of matter, the human soul, the mind, the universe; how theuniverse came into existence, etc. \"The religious world has been much startled,\"the author proceeds to say, \"and not a little excited by the utterances of menlike Spencer, Tyndall, Huxley, Proctor, and a few others of the same school.\"Admitting very cheerfully how much science owes to each of those gentlemen,nevertheless the author \"most emphatically\" denies that they have made anydiscoveries at all. There is nothing new in the speculations, even of the mostadvanced of them; nothing which was not known and taught, in one form oranother, thousands of years ago. He does not say that these scientists \"putforward their theories as their own discoveries, but they leave the fact to beimplied, and the newspapers do the rest. . . . The public, which has neithertime nor the inclination to examine the facts, adopts the faith of thenewspapers . . . and wonders what will come next! . . . The supposed originatorsof such startling theories are assailed in the newspapers. Sometimes theobnoxious scientists undertake to defend themselves, but we cannot recall asingle instance in which they have candidly said, 'Gentlemen, be not angry withus; we are merely revamping stories which are nearly as old as the mountains.' \"This would have been the simple truth; \"but even scientists or philosophers,\"adds the author, \"are not always proof against the weakness of encouraging anynotion which they think may secure niches for them among the immortal Ones.\" * Huxley, Tyndall, and even Spencer have become lately the great oracles, the\"infallible popes\" on the dogmas of protoplasm, molecules, primordial forms, andatoms. They have reaped more palms and laurels for their great discoveries thanLucretius, Cicero, Plutarch, and Seneca had hairs on their heads. Nevertheless,the works of the latter teem with ideas on the protoplasm, primordial forms,etc., let alone the atoms, which caused Demokritus to be called the atomicphilosopher. In the same Review we find this very startling denunciation: \"Who, among the innocent, has not been astonished, even within the last year, atthe wonderful results accomplished by oxygen? What an excitement Tyndall andHuxley have created by proclaiming, in their own ingenious, oracular way, justthe very doctrines which we have just quoted from Liebig; yet, as early as 1840,Professor Lyon Playfair translated into English the most 'advanced' of BaronLiebig's works.\" ** \"Another recent utterance,\" he says, \"which startled a large number of innocentand pious persons, is, that every thought we express, or attempt to express,produces a certain wonderful change in the substance of the brain. But, for thisand a good deal more of its kind, our philosophers had only to turn to the pagesof Baron Liebig. Thus, for instance, that scientist proclaims: 'Physiology hassufficiently decisive grounds for the opinions, that every thought, everysensation is accompanied by a change in the composition of the substance of thebrain; that every motion, every manifestation of force is the result of atransformation of the structure or of its substance.' \" * Thus, throughout the sensational lectures of Tyndall, we can trace, almost to apage, the whole of Liebig's speculations, interlined now and then with the stillearlier views of Demokritus and other Pagan philosophers. A potpourri of oldhypotheses elevated by the great authority of the day into quasi-demonstratedformulas, and delivered in that pathetic, picturesque, mellow, andthrillingly-eloquent phraseology so preeminently his own. Further, the same reviewer shows us many of the identical ideas and all thematerial requisite to demonstrate the great discoveries of Tyndall and Huxley,in the works of Dr. Joseph Priestley, author of Disquisitions on Matter andSpirit, and even in Herder's Philosophy of History. \"Priestley,\" adds the author, \"was not molested by government, simply because hehad no ambition to obtain fame by proclaiming his atheistic views from thehouse-top. This philosopher . . . was the author of from seventy to eightyvolumes, and the discoverer of oxygen.\" It is in these works that \"he putsforward those identical ideas which have been declared so 'startling,' 'bold,'etc., as the utterances of our present-day philosophers.\" \"Our readers,\" he proceeds to say, \"remember what an excitement has been createdby the utterances of some of our modern philosophers as to the origin and natureof ideas, but those utterances, like others that preceded and followed them,contain nothing new.\" \"An idea,\" says Plutarch, \"is a being incorporeal, whichhas no subsistence by itself, but gives figure and form unto shapeless matter,and becomes the cause of its manifestation\" (De Placitio Philosophorum). Verily, no modern atheist, Mr. Huxley included, can outvie Epicurus inmaterialism; he can but mimic him. And what is his \"protoplasm,\" but a rechauffeof the speculations of the Hindu Swabhavikas or Pantheists, who assert that allthings, the gods as well as men and animals, are born from Swabhava or their ownnature? ** As to Epicurus, this is what Lucretius makes him say: \"The soul, thusproduced, must be material, because we trace it issuing from a material source;because it exists, and exists alone in a material system; is nourished bymaterial food; grows with the growth of the body; becomes matured with itsmaturity; declines with its decay; and hence, whether belonging to man or brute,must die with its death.\" Nevertheless, we would remind the reader that Epicurusis here speaking of the Astral Soul, not of Divine Spirit. Still, if we rightlyunderstand the above, Mr. Huxley's \"mutton-protoplasm\" is of a very ancientorigin, and can claim for its birthplace, Athens, and for its cradle, the brainof old Epicurus. Further, still, anxious not to be misunderstood or found guilty of depreciatingthe labor of any of our scientists, the author closes his essay by remarking,\"We merely want to show that, at least, that portion of the public whichconsiders itself intelligent and enlightened should cultivate its memory, orremember the 'advanced' thinkers of the past much better than it does.Especially should those do so who, whether from the desk, the rostrum, or thepulpit, undertake to instruct all willing to be instructed by them. There wouldthen be much less groundless apprehension, much less charlatanism, and aboveall, much less plagiarism, than there is.\" * Truly says Cudworth that the greatest ignorance of which our modern wiseacresaccuse the ancients is their belief in the soul's immortality. Like the oldskeptic of Greece, our scientists--to use an expression of the same Dr.Cudworth--are afraid that if they admit spirits and apparitions they must admita God too; and there is nothing too absurd, he adds, for them to suppose, inorder to keep out the existence of God. The great body of ancient materialists,skeptical as they now seem to us, thought otherwise, and Epicurus, who rejectedthe soul's immortality, believed still in a God, and Demokritus fully concededthe reality of apparitions. The preexistence and God-like powers of the humanspirit were believed in by most all the sages of ancient days. The magic ofBabylon and Persia based upon it the doctrine of their machagistia. The ChaldeanOracles, on which Pletho and Psellus have so much commented, constantlyexpounded and amplified their testimony. Zoroaster, Pythagoras, Epicharmus,Empedocles, Kebes, Euripides, Plato, Euclid, Philo, Boehius, Virgil, MarcusCicero, Plotinus, Iamblichus, Proclus, Psellus, Synesius, Origen, and, finally,Aristotle himself, far from denying our immortality, support it mostemphatically. Like Cardon and Pompanatius, \"who were no friends to the soul'simmortality,\" as says Henry More, \"Aristotle expressly concludes that therational soul is both a distinct being from the soul of the world, though of thesame essence,\" and that \"it does preexist before it comes into the body.\" ** Years have rolled away since the Count Joseph De Maistre wrote a sentence which,if appropriate to the Voltairean epoch in which he lived, applies with stillmore justice to our period of utter skepticism. \"I have heard,\" writes thiseminent man, \"I have heard and read of myriads of good jokes on the ignorance ofthe ancients, who were always seeing spirits everywhere; methinks that we are agreat deal more imbecile than our forefathers, in never perceiving any such now,anywhere.\" * [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES206:* \"Antidote,\" lib. i., cap. 4. 206:** \"Letter to Glanvil, the author of 'Sadducismus Triumphatus,' May, 25,1678.\" 207:* \"History of Magic,\" vol. ii., p. 272. 207:** \"Apologie pour tous les grands personnages faussement accuses de magie.\" 207:*** Berlin, 1817. 207:**** \"Nova Medicina Spirituum,\" 1675. 207:***** \"History of Magic.\" 208:* It would be a useless and too long labor to enter here upon the defence ofKepler's theory of relation between the five regular solids of geometry and themagnitudes of the orbits of five principal planets, rather derided by Prof.Draper in his \"Conflict.\" Many are the theories of the ancients that have beenavenged by modern discovery.

Proctor's latest work on astronomy, entitled Our Placeamong Infinities, contains the following extraordinary words: \"It was theirignorance of the earth's place among infinities, which led the ancients toregard the heavenly bodies as ruling favorably or adversely the fates of men andnations, and to dedicate the days in sets of seven to the seven planets of theirastrological system.\" Mr. Proctor makes two distinct assertions in this sentence: 1. That the ancientswere ignorant of the earth's place among infinities; and 2. That they regardedthe heavenly bodies as ruling, favorably or adversely, the fates of men andnations. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu007.htm#fn_370]We are veryconfident that there is at least good reason to suspect that the ancients werefamiliar with the movements, emplacement, and mutual relations of the heavenlybodies. The testimony of Plutarch, Professor Draper, and Jowett, aresufficiently explicit. But we would ask Mr. Proctor how it happens, if theancient astronomers were so ignorant of the law of the birth and death of worldsthat, in the fragmentary bits which the hand of time has spared us of ancientlore there should be--albeit couched in obscure language--so much informationwhich the most recent discoveries of science have verified? Beginning with thetenth page of the work under notice, Mr. Proctor sketches for us the theory ofthe formation of our earth, and the successive changes through which it passeduntil it became habitable for man. In vivid colors he depicts the gradualaccretion of cosmic matter into gaseous spheres surrounded with \"a liquidnon-permanent shell\"; the condensation of both; the ultimate solidification ofthe external crust; the slow cooling of the mass; the chemical results followingthe action of intense heat upon the primitive earthy matter; the formation ofsoils and their distribution; the change in the constitution of the atmosphere;the appearance of vegetation and animal life; and, finally, the advent of man. Now, let us turn to the oldest written records left us by the Chaldeans, theHermetic Book of Numbers, * and see what we shall find in the allegoricallanguage of Hermes, Kadmus, or Thuti, the thrice great Trismegistus. \"In thebeginning of time the great invisible one had his holy hands full of celestialmatter which he scattered throughout the infinity; and lo, behold! it becameballs of fire and balls of clay; and they scattered like the moving metal **into many smaller balls, and began their ceaseless turning; and some of themwhich were balls of fire became balls of clay; and the balls of clay becameballs of fire; and the balls of fire were waiting their time to become balls ofclay; and the others envied them and bided their time to become balls of puredivine fire.\" Could any one ask a clearer definition of the cosmic changes which Mr. Proctorso elegantly expounds? Here we have the distribution of matter throughout space; then its concentrationinto the spherical form; the separation of smaller spheres from the greaterones; axial rotation; the gradual change of orbs from the incandescent to theearthy consistence; and, finally, the total loss of heat which marks theirentrance into the stage of planetary death. The change of the balls of clay intoballs of fire would be understood by materialists to indicate some suchphenomenon as the sudden ignition of the star in Cassiopeia, A.D. 1572, and theone in Serpentarius, in 1604, which was noted by Kepler. But, do the Chaldeansevince in this expression a profounder philosophy than of our day? Does thischange into balls of \"pure divine fire\" signify a continuous planetaryexistence, correspondent with the spirit-life of man, beyond the awful mysteryof death? If worlds have, as the astronomers tell us, their periods of embryo,infancy, adolescence, maturity, decadence, and death, may they not, like man,have their continued existence in a sublimated, ethereal, or spiritual form? Themagians so affirm. They tell us that the fecund mother Earth is subject to thesame laws as every one of her children. At her appointed time she brings forthall created things; in the fulness of her days she is gathered to the tomb ofworlds. Her gross, material body slowly parts with its atoms under theinexorable law which demands their new arrangement in other combinations. Herown perfected vivifying spirit obeys the eternal attraction which draws ittoward that central spiritual sun from which it was originally evolved, andwhich we vaguely know under the name of GOD. \"And the heaven was visible in seven circles, and the planets appeared with alltheir signs, in star-form, and the stars were divided and numbered with therulers that were in them, and their revolving course was bounded with the air,and borne with a circular course, through the agency of the divine SPIRIT.\"* We challenge any one to indicate a single passage in the works of Hermes whichproves him guilty of that crowning absurdity of the Church of Rome whichassumed, upon the geocentric theory of astronomy, that the heavenly bodies weremade for our use and pleasure, and that it was worth while for the only son ofGod to descend upon this cosmic mote and die in expiation for our sins! Mr.Proctor tells us of a liquid non-permanent shell of uncongealed matter enclosinga \"viscous plastic ocean,\" within which \"there is another interior solid globerotating.\" We, on our part, turn to the Magia Adamica of Eugenius Philalethes,published in 1650, and at page 12, we find him quoting from Trismegistus in thefollowing terms: \"Hermes affirmeth that in the Beginning the earth was aquackmire or quivering kind of jelly, it being nothing else but water congealedby the incubation and heat of the divine spirit; cum adhuc (sayeth he) Terratremula esset, Lucente sole compacta est.\" In the same work Philalethes, speaking in his quaint, symbolical way, says, \"Theearth is invisible . . . on my soul it is so, and which is more, the eye of mannever saw the earth, nor can it be seen without art. To make this elementinvisible, is the greatest secret in magic . . . as for this faeculent, grossbody upon which we walk, it is a compost, and no earth but it hath earth in it,. . . in a word all the elements are visible but one, namely the earth, and whenthou hast attained to so much perfection as to know why God hath placed theearth in abscondito, * thou hast an excellent figure whereby to know GodHimself, and how He is visible, how invisible.\" ** Ages before our savants of the nineteenth century came into existence, a wiseman of the Orient thus expressed himself, in addressing the invisible Deity:\"For thy Almighty Hand, that made the world of formless matter.\" *** There is much more contained in this language than we are willing to explain,but we will say that the secret is worth the seeking; perhaps in this formlessmatter, the pre-Adamite earth, is contained a \"potency\" with which Messrs.Tyndall and Huxley would be glad to acquaint themselves. But to descend from universals to particulars, from the ancient theory ofplanetary evolution to the evolution of plant and animal life, as opposed to thetheory of special creation, what does Mr. Proctor call the following language ofHermes but an anticipation of the modern theory of evolution of species? \"WhenGod had filled his powerful hands with those things which are in nature, and inthat which compasseth nature, then shutting them close again, he said: 'Receivefrom me, O holy earth! that art ordained to be the mother of all, lest thoushouldst want anything'; when presently opening such hands as it becomes a Godto have, he poured down all that was necessary to the constitution of things.\"Here we have primeval matter imbued with \"the promise and potency of everyfuture form of life,\" and the earth declared to be the predestined mother ofeverything that should thenceforth spring from her bosom. More definite is the language of Marcus Antoninus in his discourse to himself.\"The nature of the universe delights not in anything so much as to alter allthings, and present them under another form. This is her conceit to play onegame and begin another. Matter is placed before her like a piece of wax and sheshapes it to all forms and figures. Now she makes a bird, then out of the bird abeast--now a flower, then a frog, and she is pleased with her own magicalperformances as men are with their own fancies.\" * Before any of our modern teachers thought of evolution, the ancients taught us,through Hermes, that nothing can be abrupt in nature; that she never proceeds byjumps and starts, that everything in her works is slow harmony, and that thereis nothing sudden--not even violent death. The slow development from preexisting forms was a doctrine with the RosicrucianIlluminati. The Tres Matres showed Hermes the mysterious progress of their work,before they condescended to reveal themselves to mediaeval alchemists. Now, inthe Hermetic dialect, these three mothers are the symbol of light, heat, andelectricity, or magnetism, the two latter being as convertible as the whole ofthe forces or agents which have a place assigned them in the modern\"Force-correlation.\" Synesius mentions books of stone which he found in thetemple of Memphis, on which was engraved the following sentence: \"One naturedelights in another, one nature overcomes another, one nature overrules another,and the whole of them are one.\" The inherent restlessness of matter is embodied in the saying of Hermes: \"Actionis the life of Phta\"; and Orpheus calls nature πολυμεχανος μετερ, \"the motherthat makes many things,\" or the ingenious, the contriving, the inventive mother. Mr. Proctor says: \"All that that is upon and within the earth, all vegetableforms and all animal forms, our bodies, our brains, are formed of materialswhich have been drawn in from those depths of space surrounding us on allsides.\" The Hermetists and the later Rosicrucians held that all things visibleand invisible were produced by the contention of light with darkness, and thatevery particle of matter contains within itself a spark of the divineessence--or light, spirit--which, through its tendency to free itself from itsentanglement and return to the central source, produced motion in the particles,and from motion forms were born. Says Hargrave Jennings, quoting Robertus diFluctibus: \"Thus all minerals in this spark of life have the rudimentarypossibility of plants and growing organisms; thus all plants have rudimentarysensations which might (in the ages) enable them to perfect and transmute intolocomotive new creatures, lesser or higher in their grade, or nobler or meanerin their functions; thus all plants, and all vegetation might pass off (by sideroads) into more distinguished highways as it were, of independent, completeradvance, allowing their original spark of light to expand and thrill with higherand more vivid force, and to urge forward with more abounding, informed purpose,all wrought by planetary influence directed by the unseen spirits (or workers)of the great original architect.\" * Light--the first mentioned in Genesis, is termed by the kabalists, Sephira, orthe Divine Intelligence, the mother of all the Sephiroth, while the ConcealedWisdom is the father. Light is the first begotten, and the first emanation ofthe Supreme, and Light is Life, says the evangelist. Both are electricity--thelife-principle, the anima mundi, pervading the universe, the electric vivifierof all things. Light is the great Protean magician, and under the Divine Will ofthe architect, its multifarious, omnipotent waves gave birth to every form aswell as to every living being. From its swelling, electric bosom, springs matterand spirit. Within its beams lie the beginnings of all physical and chemicalaction, and of all cosmic and spiritual phenomena; it vitalizes anddisorganizes; it gives life and produces death, and from its primordial pointgradually emerged into existence the myriads of worlds, visible and invisiblecelestial bodies. It was at the ray of this First mother, one in three, thatGod, according to Plato, \"lighted a fire, which we now call the sun,\" ** and,which is not the cause of either light or heat, but merely the focus, or, as wemight say, the lens, by which the rays of the primordial light becomematerialized, are concentrated upon our solar system, and produce all thecorrelations of forces. So much for the first of Mr. Proctor's two propositions; now for the second. The work which we have been noticing, comprises a series of twelve essays, ofwhich the last is entitled Thoughts on Astrology. The author treats the subjectwith so much more consideration than is the custom of men of his class, that itis evident he has given it thoughtful attention. In fact, he goes so far as tosay that, \"If we consider the matter aright, we must concede . . . that of allthe errors into which men have fallen in their desire to penetrate intofuturity, astrology is the most respectable, we may even say the mostreasonable.\" * He admits that \"The heavenly bodies do rule the fates of men and nations in themost unmistakable manner, seeing that without the controlling and beneficentinfluences of the chief among those orbs--the sun--every living creature on theearth must perish.\" ** He admits, also, the influence of the moon, and seesnothing strange in the ancients reasoning by analogy, that if two among theseheavenly bodies were thus potent in terrestrial influences, it was \" . . .natural that the other moving bodies known to the ancients, should be thought topossess also their special powers.\" *** Indeed, the professor sees nothingunreasonable in their supposition that the influences exerted by the slowermoving planets \"might be even more potent that those of the sun himself.\" Mr.Proctor thinks that the system of astrology \"was formed gradually and perhapstentatively.\" Some influences may have been inferred from observed events, thefate of this or that king or chief, guiding astrologers in assigning particularinfluences to such planetary aspects as were presented at the time of hisnativity. Others may have been invented, and afterward have found generalacceptance, because confirmed by some curious coincidences. A witty joke may sound very prettily, even in a learned treatise, and the word\"coincidence\" may be applied to anything we are unwilling to accept. But asophism is not a truism; still less is it a mathematical demonstration, whichalone ought to serve as a beacon--to astronomers, at least. Astrology is ascience as infallible as astronomy itself, with the condition, however, that itsinterpreters must be equally infallible; and it is this condition, sine qua non,so very difficult of realization, that has always proved a stumbling-block toboth. Astrology is to exact astronomy what psychology is to exact physiology. Inastrology and psychology one has to step beyond the visible world of matter, andenter into the domain of transcendent spirit. It is the old struggle between thePlatonic and Aristotelean schools, and it is not in our century of Sadduceanskepticism that the former will prevail over the latter. Mr. Proctor, in hisprofessional capacity, is like the uncharitable person of the Sermon on theMount, who is ever ready to attract public attention to the mote in his despisedneighbor's eye, and overlook the beam in his own. Were we to record the failuresand ridiculous blunders of astronomers, we are afraid they would outnumber byfar those of the astrologers. Present events fully vindicate Nostradamus, whohas been so much ridiculed by our skeptics. In an old book of prophecies,published in the fifteenth century (an edition of 1453), we read the following,among other astrological predictions: * \"In twice two hundred years, the BearThe Crescent will assail;But if the Cock and Bull unite,The Bear will not prevail.In twice ten years again --Let Islam know and fear --The Cross shall stand, the Crescent wane,Dissolve, and disappear.\"In just twice two hundred years from the date of that prophecy, we had theCrimean war, during which the alliance of the Gallic Cock and English Bullinterfered with the political designs of the Russian Bear. In 1856 the war wasended, and Turkey, or the Crescent, closely escaped destruction. In the presentyear (1876) the most unexpected events of a political character have just takenplace, and twice ten years have elapsed since peace was proclaimed. Everythingseems to bid fair for a fulfilment of the old prophecy; the future will tellwhether the Moslem Crescent, which seems, indeed, to be waning, will irrevocably\"wane, dissolve, and disappear,\" as the outcome of the present troubles. In explaining away the heterodox facts which he appears to have encountered inhis pursuit of knowledge, Mr. Proctor is obliged more than once in his work, tofall back upon these \"curious coincidences.\" One of the most curious of these isstated by him in a foot-note (page 301) as follows: \"I do not here dwell on thecurious coincidence--if, indeed, Chaldean astrologers had not discovered thering of Saturn--that they showed the god corresponding within a ring and triple.. . . Very moderate optical knowledge--such, indeed, as we may fairly infer fromthe presence of optical instruments among Assyrian remains--might have led tothe discovery of Saturnal rings and Jupiter's moons. . . . Bel, the AssyrianJupiter,\" he adds, \"was represented sometimes with four star-tipped wings. Butit is possible that these are mere coincidences.\" In short, Mr. Proctor's theory of coincidence becomes finally more suggestive ofmiracle than the facts themselves. For coincidences our friends the skepticsappear to have an unappeasable appetite. We have brought sufficient testimony inthe preceding chapter to show that the ancients must have used as good opticalinstruments as we have now. Were the instruments in possession of Nebuchadnezzarof such moderate power, and the knowledge of his astronomers so verycontemptible, when, according to Rawlinson's reading of the tiles, theBirs-Nimrud, or temple of Borsippa, had seven stages, symbolical of theconcentric circles of the seven spheres, each built of tiles and metals tocorrespond with the color of the ruling planet of the sphere typified? Is it acoincidence again, that they should have appropriated to each planet the colorwhich our latest telescopic discoveries show to be the real one? * Or is itagain a coincidence, that Plato should have indicated in the Timaeus hisknowledge of the indestructibility of matter, of conservation of energy, andcorrelation of forces? \"The latest word of modern philosophy,\" says Jowett, \"iscontinuity and development, but to Plato this is the beginning and foundation ofscience.\" ** The radical element of the oldest religions was essentially sabaistic; and wemaintain that their myths and allegories--if once correctly and thoroughlyinterpreted, will dovetail with the most exact astronomical notions of our day.We will say more; there is hardly a scientific law--whether pertaining tophysical astronomy or physical geography--that could not be easily pointed outin the ingenious combinations of their fables. They allegorized the mostimportant as well as the most trifling causes of the celestial motions; thenature of every phenomenon was personified; and in the mythical biographies ofthe Olympic gods and goddesses, one well acquainted with the latest principlesof physics and chemistry can find their causes, inter-agencies, and mutualrelations embodied in the deportment and course of action of the fickle deities.The atmospheric electricity in its neutral and latent states is embodied usuallyin demi-gods and goddesses, whose scene of action is more limited to earth andwho, in their occasional flights to the higher deific regions, display theirelectric tempers always in strict proportion with the increase of distance fromthe earth's surface: the weapons of Hercules and Thor were never more mortalthan when the gods soared into the clouds. We must bear in mind that before thetime when the Olympian Jupiter was anthropomorphized by the genius of Pheidiasinto the Omnipotent God, the Maximus, the God of gods, and thus abandoned to theadoration of the multitudes, in the earliest and abstruse science of symbologyhe embodied in his person and attributes the whole of the cosmic forces. TheMyth was less metaphysical and complicated, but more truly eloquent as anexpression of natural philosophy. Zeus, the male element of the creation withChthonia--Vesta (the earth), and Metis (the water) the first of the Oceanides(the feminine principles)--was viewed according to Porphyry and Proclus as thezoon-ek-zoon, the chief of living beings. In the Orphic theology, the oldest ofall, metaphysically speaking, he represented both the potentia and actus, theunrevealed cause and the Demiurge, or the active creator as an emanation fromthe invisible potency. In the latter demiurgic capacity, in conjunction with hisconsorts, we find in him all the mightiest agents of cosmic evolution--chemicalaffinity, atmospheric electricity, attraction, and repulsion. It is in following his representations in this physical qualification that wediscover how well acquainted were the ancients with all the doctrines ofphysical science in their modern development. Later, in the Pythagoreanspeculations, Zeus became the metaphysical trinity; the monad evolving from itsinvisible SELF the active cause, effect, and intelligent will, the whole formingthe Tetractis. Still later we find the earlier Neoplatonists leaving the primalmonad aside, on the ground of its utter incomprehensibleness to human intellect,speculating merely on the demiurgic triad of this deity as visible andintelligible in its effects; and thus the metaphysical continuation by Plotinus,Porphyry, Proclus, and other philosophers of this view of Zeus the father, ZeusPoseidon, or dunamis, the son and power, and the spirit or nous. This triad wasalso accepted as a whole by the Irenaeic school of the second century; the moresubstantial difference between the doctrines of the Neo-platonists and theChristians being merely the forcible amalgamation by the latter of theincomprehensible monad with its actualized creative trinity. In his astronomical aspect Zeus-Dionysus has his origin in the zodiac, theancient solar year. In Libya he assumed the form of a ram, and is identical withthe Egyptian Amun, who begat Osiris, the taurian god. Osiris is also apersonified emanation of the Father-Sun, and himself the Sun in Taurus. TheParent-Sun being the Sun in Aries. As the latter, Jupiter, is in the guise of aram, and as Jupiter-Dionysus or Jupiter-Osiris, he is the bull. This animal is,as it is well known, the symbol of the creative power; moreover the Kabalaexplains, through the medium of one of its chief expounders, Simon-Ben-Iochai, *the origin of this strange worship of the bulls and cows. It is neither Darwinnor Huxley--the founders of the doctrine of evolution and its necessarycomplement, the transformation of species--that can find anything against therationality of this symbol, except, perhaps, a natural feeling of uneasinessupon finding that they were preceded by the ancients even in this particularmodern discovery. Elsewhere, we will give the doctrine of the kabalists astaught by Simon-Ben-Iochai. It may be easily proved that from time immemorial Saturn or Kronos, whose ring,most positively, was discovered by the Chaldean astrologers, and whose symbolismis no \"coincidence,\" was considered the father of Zeus, before the latter becamehimself the father of all the gods, and was the highest deity. He was the Bel orBaal of the Chaldeans, and originally imported among them by the Akkadians.Rawlinson insists that the latter came from Armenia; but if so, how can weaccount for the fact that Bel is but a Babylonian personification of the HinduSiva, or Bala, the fire-god, the omnipotent creative, and at the same time,destroying Deity, in many senses higher than Brahma himself? \"Zeus,\" says an Orphic hymn, \"is the first and the last, the head, and theextremities; from him have proceeded all things. He is a man and an immortalnymph (male and female element); the soul of all things; and the principal motorin fire; he is the sun and the moon; the fountain of the ocean; the demiurgus ofthe universe; one power, one God; the mighty creator and governor of the cosmos.Everything, fire, water, earth, ether, night, the heavens, Metis, the primevalarchitecturess (the Sophia of the Gnostics, and the Sephira of the Kabalists),the beautiful Eros, Cupid, all is included within the vast dimensions of hisglorious body!\" ** This short hymn of laudation contains within itself the groundwork of everymythopoeic conception. The imagination of the ancients proved as boundless asthe visible manifestations of the Deity itself which afforded them the themesfor their allegories. Still the latter, exuberant as they seem, never departedfrom the two principal ideas which may be ever found running parallel in theirsacred imagery; a strict adherence to the physical as well as moral or spiritualaspect of natural law. Their metaphysical researches never clashed withscientific truths, and their religions may be truly termed thepsycho-physiological creeds of the priests and scientists, who built them on thetraditions of the infant-world, such as the unsophisticated minds of theprimitive races received them, and on their own experimental knowledge, hoarywith all the wisdom of the intervening ages. As the sun, what better image could be found for Jupiter emitting his goldenrays than to personify this emanation in Diana, the all-illuminating virginArtemis, whose oldest name was Diktynna, literally the emitted ray, from theword dikein. The moon is non-luminous, and it shines only by the reflected lightof the sun; hence, the imagery of his daughter, the goddess of the moon, andherself, Luna, Astarte, or Diana. As the Cretan Diktynna, she wears a wreathmade of the magic plant diktamnon, or dictamnus, the evergreen shrub whosecontact is said, at the same time, to develop somnambulism and cure finally ofit; and, as Eilithyia and Juno Pronuba, she is the goddess who presides overbirths; she is an AEsculapian deity, and the use of the dictamnus-wreath, inassociation with the moon, shows once more the profound observation of theancients. This plant is known in botany as possessing strongly sedativeproperties; it grows on Mount Dicte, a Cretan mountain, in great abundance; onthe other hand, the moon, according to the best authorities on animal magnetism,acts upon the juices and ganglionic system, or nerve-cells, the seat from whenceproceed all the nerve-fibres which play such a prominent part in mesmerization.During childbirth the Cretan women were covered with this plant, and its rootswere administered as best calculated to soothe acute pain, and allay theirritability so dangerous at this period. They were placed, moreover, within theprecincts of the temple sacred to the goddess, and, if possible, under thedirect rays of the resplendent daughter of Jupiter--the bright and warm Easternmoon. The Hindu Brahmans and Buddhists have complicated theories on the influence ofthe sun and moon (the male and female elements), as containing the negative andpositive principles, the opposites of the magnetic polarity. \"The influence ofthe moon on women is well known,\" write all the old authors on magnetism; andEnnemoser, as well as Du Potet, confirm the theories of the Hindu seers in everyparticular. The marked respect paid by the Buddhists to the sapphire-stone--which was alsosacred to Luna, in every other country--may be found based on something morescientifically exact than a mere groundless superstition. They ascribed to it asacred magical power, which every student of psychological mesmerism willreadily understand, for its polished and deep-blue surface producesextraordinary somnambulic phenomena. The varied influence of the prismaticcolors on the growth of vegetation, and especially that of the \"blue ray,\" hasbeen recognized but recently. The Academicians quarrelled over the unequalheating power of the prismatic rays until a series of experimentaldemonstrations by General Pleasonton, proved that under the blue ray, the mostelectric of all, animal and vegetable growth was increased to a magicalproportion. Thus Amoretti's investigations of the electric polarity of preciousstones show that the diamond, the garnet, the amethyst, are - E., while thesapphire is + E. * Thus, we are enabled to show that the latest experiments ofscience only corroborate that which was known to the Hindu sages before any ofthe modern academies were founded. An old Hindu legend says thatBrahma-Prajapati, having fallen in love with his own daughter, Ushas (Heaven,sometimes the Dawn also), assumed the form of a buck (ris'ya) and Ushas that ofa female deer (rohit) and thus committed the first sin. ** Upon seeing such adesecration, the gods felt so terrified, that uniting their most fearful-lookingbodies--each god possessing as many bodies as he desires--they produced Bhutavan(the spirit of evil), who was created by them on purpose to destroy theincarnation of the first sin committed by the Brahma himself. Upon seeing this,Brahma-Hiranyagarbha *** repented bitterly and began repeating the Mantras, orprayers of purification, and, in his grief, dropped on earth a tear, the hottestthat ever fell from an eye; and from it was formed the first sapphire. This half-sacred, half-popular legend shows that the Hindus knew which was themost electric of all the prismatic colors; moreover, the particular influence ofthe sapphire-stone was as well defined as that of all the other minerals.Orpheus teaches how it is possible to affect a whole audience by means of alodestone; Pythagoras pays a particular attention to the color and nature ofprecious stones; while Apollonius of Tyana imparts to his disciples the secretvirtues of each, and changes his jewelled rings daily, using a particular stonefor every day of the month and according to the laws of judicial astrology. TheBuddhists assert that the sapphire produces peace of mind, equanimity, andchases all evil thoughts by establishing a healthy circulation in man. So doesan electric battery, with its well-directed fluid, say our electricians. \"Thesapphire,\" say the Buddhists, \"will open barred doors and dwellings (for thespirit of man); it produces a desire for prayer, and brings with it more peacethan any other gem; but he who would wear it must lead a pure and holylife.\" **** Diana-Luna is the daughter of Zeus by Proserpina, who represents the Earth inher active labor, and, according to Hesiod, as Diana Eilythia-Lucina she isJuno's daughter. But Juno, devoured by Kronos or Saturn, and restored back tolife by the Oceanid Metis, is also known as the Earth. Saturn, as the evolutionof Time, swallows the earth in one of the ante-historical cataclysms, and it isonly when Metis (the waters) by retreating in her many beds, frees thecontinent, that Juno is said to be restored to her first shape. The idea isexpressed in the 9th and 10th verses of the first chapter of Genesis. In thefrequent matrimonial quarrels between Juno and Jupiter, Diana is alwaysrepresented as turning her back on her mother and smiling upon her father,though she chides him for his numerous frolics. The Thessalian magicians aresaid to have been obliged, during such eclipses, to draw her attention to theearth by the power of their spells and incantations, and the Babylonianastrologers and magi never desisted in their spells until they brought about areconciliation between the irritated couple, after which Juno \"radiantly smiledon the bright goddess\" Diana, who, encircling her brow with her crescent,returned to her hunting-place in the mountains. It seems to us that the fable illustrates the different phases of the moon. We,the inhabitants of the earth, never see but one-half of our bright satellite,who thus turns her back to her mother Juno. The sun, the moon, and the earth areconstantly changing positions with relation to each other. With the new moonthere is constantly a change of weather; and sometimes the wind and storms maywell suggest a quarrel between the sun and earth, especially when the former isconcealed by grumbling thunder-clouds. Furthermore, the new moon, when her darkside is turned toward us, is invisible; and it is only after a reconciliationbetween the sun and the earth, that a bright crescent becomes visible on theside nearest to the sun, though this time Luna is not illuminated by sunlightdirectly received, but by sunlight reflected from the earth to the moon, and byher reflected back to us. Hence, the Chaldean astrologers and the magicians ofThessaly, who probably watched and determined as accurately as a Babinet thecourse of the celestial bodies, were said by their enchantments to force themoon to descend on earth, i.e., to show her crescent, which she could do butafter receiving the \"radiant smile\" from her mother-earth, who put it on afterthe conjugal reconciliation. Diana-Luna, having adorned her head with hercrescent, returns back to hunt in her mountains. As to calling in question the intrinsic knowledge of the ancients on the groundof their \"superstitious deductions from natural phenomena,\" it is as appropriateas it would be if, five hundred years hence, our descendants should regard thepupils of Professor Balfour Stewart as ancient ignoramuses, and himself ashallow philosopher. If modern science, in the person of this gentleman, cancondescend to make experiments to determine whether the appearance of the spotson the sun's surface is in any way connected with the potato disease, and findsit is; and that, moreover, \"the earth is very seriously affected by what takesplace in the sun,\" * why should the ancient astrologers be held up as eitherfools or arrant knaves? There is the same relation between natural and judicialor judiciary astrology, as between physiology and psychology, the physical andthe moral. If in later centuries these sciences were degraded into charlatanryby some money-making impostors, is it just to extend the accusation to thosemighty men of old who, by their persevering studies and holy lives, bestowed animmortal name upon Chaldea and Babylonia? Surely those who are now found to havemade correct astronomical observations ranging back to \"within 100 years fromthe flood,\" from the top observatory of the \"cloud-encompassed Bel,\" as Prof.Draper has it, can hardly be considered impostors. If their mode of impressingupon the popular minds the great astronomical truths differed from the \"systemof education\" of our present century and appears ridiculous to some, thequestion still remains unanswered: which of the two systems was the best? Withthem science went hand in hand with religion, and the idea of God wasinseparable from that of his works. And while in the present century there isnot one person out of ten thousand who knows, if he ever knew the fact at all,that the planet Uranus is next to Saturn, and revolves about the sun ineighty-four years; and that Saturn is next to Jupiter, and takes twenty-nine anda half years to make one complete revolution in its orbit; while Jupiterperforms his revolution in twelve years; the uneducated masses of Babylon andGreece, having impressed on their minds that Uranus was the father of Saturn,and Saturn that of Jupiter, considering them furthermore deities as well as alltheir satellites and attendants, we may perhaps infer from it, that whileEuropeans only discovered Uranus in 1781, a curious coincidence is to be noticedin the above myths. We have but to open the most common book on astrology, and compare thedescriptions embraced in the Fable of the Twelve Houses with the most moderndiscoveries of science as to the nature of the planets and the elements in eachstar, to see that without any spectroscope the ancients were perfectly wellacquainted with the same. Unless the fact is again regarded as \"a coincidence,\"we can learn, to a certain extent, of the degree of the solar heat, light, andnature of the planets by simply studying their symbolic representations in theOlympic gods, and the twelve signs of the zodiac, to each of which in astrologyis attributed a particular quality. If the goddesses of our own planet vary inno particular from other gods and goddesses, but all have a like physicalnature, does not this imply that the sentinels who watched from the top of Bel'stower, by day as well as by night, holding communion with the euhemerizeddeities, had remarked, before ourselves, the physical unity of the universe andthe fact that the planets above are made of precisely the same chemical elementsas our own? The sun in Aries, Jupiter, is shown in astrology as a masculine,diurnal, cardinal, equinoctial, easterly sign, hot and dry, and answersperfectly to the character attributed to the fickle \"Father of the gods.\" Whenangry Zeus-Akrios snatches from his fiery belt the thunderbolts which he hurlsforth from heaven, he rends the clouds and descends as Jupiter Pluvius intorrents of rain. He is the greatest and highest of gods, and his movements areas rapid as lightning itself. The planet Jupiter is known to revolve on its axisso rapidly that the point of its equator turns at the rate of 450 miles aminute. An immense excess of centrifugal force at the equator is believed tohave caused the planet to become extremely flattened at the poles; and in Cretethe personified god Jupiter was represented without ears. The planet Jupiter'sdisk is crossed by dark belts; varying in breadth, they appear to be connectedwith its rotation on its axis, and are produced by disturbances in itsatmosphere. The face of Father Zeus, says Hesiod, became spotted with rage whenhe beheld the Titans ready to rebel. In Mr. Proctor's book, astronomers seem especially doomed by Providence toencounter all kinds of curious \"coincidences,\" for he gives us many cases out ofthe \"multitude,\" and even of the \"thousands of facts [sic].\" To this list we mayadd the army of Egyptologists and archaeologists who of late have been thechosen pets of the capricious Dame Chance, who, moreover, generally selects\"well-to-do Arabs\" and other Eastern gentlemen, to play the part of benevolentgenii to Oriental scholars in difficulties. Professor Ebers is one of the latestfavored ones. It is a well-known fact, that whenever Champollion neededimportant links, he fell in with them in the most various and unexpected ways. Voltaire, the greatest of \"infidels\" of the eighteenth century, used to say,that if there were no God, people would have to invent one. Volney, another\"materialist,\" nowhere throughout his numerous writings denies the existence ofGod. On the contrary, he plainly asserts several times that the universe is thework of the \"All-wise,\" and is convinced that there is a Supreme Agent, auniversal and identical Artificer, designated by the name of God. * Voltairebecomes, toward the end of his life, Pythagorical, and concludes by saying: \"Ihave consumed forty years of my pilgrimage . . . seeking the philosopher's stonecalled truth. I have consulted all the adepts of antiquity, Epicurus andAugustine, Plato and Malebranche, and I still remain in ignorance. . . . Allthat I have been able to obtain by comparing and combining the system of Plato,of the tutor of Alexander, Pythagoras, and the Oriental, is this: Chance is aword void of sense. The world is arranged according to mathematical laws.\" * It is pertinent for us to suggest that Mr. Proctor's stumbling-block is thatwhich trips the feet of all materialistic scientists, whose views he butrepeats; he confounds the physical and spiritual operations of nature. His verytheory of the probable inductive reasoning of the ancients as to the subtileinfluences of the more remote planets, by comparison with the familiar andpotent effects of the sun and moon upon our earth, shows the drift of his mind.Because science affirms that the sun imparts physical heat and light to us, andthe moon affects the tides, he thinks that the ancients must have regarded theother heavenly bodies as exerting the same kind of influence upon us physically,and indirectly upon our fortunes. ** And here we must permit ourselves adigression. How the ancients regarded the heavenly bodies is very hard to determine, for oneunacquainted with the esoteric explanation of their doctrines. While philologyand comparative theology have begun the arduous work of analysis, they have asyet arrived at meagre results. The allegorical form of speech has often led ourcommentators so far astray, that they have confounded causes with effects, andvice versa. In the baffling phenomenon of force-correlation, even our greatestscientists would find it very hard to explain which of these forces is thecause, and which the effect, since each may be both by turns, and convertible.Thus, if we should inquire of the physicists, \"Is it light which generates heat,or the latter which produces light?\" we would in all probability be answeredthat it is certainly light which creates heat. Very well; but how? did the greatArtificer first produce light, or did He first construct the sun, which is saidto be the sole dispenser of light, and, consequently, heat? These questions mayappear at first glance indicative of ignorance; but, perhaps, if we ponder themdeeply, they will assume another appearance. In Genesis, the \"Lord\" firstcreates light, and three days and three nights are alleged to pass away beforeHe creates the sun, the moon, and the stars. This gross blunder against exactscience has created much merriment among materialists. And they certainly wouldbe warranted in laughing, if their doctrine that our light and heat are derivedfrom the sun were unassailable. Until recently, nothing has happened to upsetthis theory, which, for lack of a better one, according to the expression of apreacher, \"reigns sovereign in the Empire of Hypothesis.\" The ancientsun-worshippers regarded the Great Spirit as a nature-god, identical withnature, and the sun as the deity, \"in whom the Lord of life dwells.\" Gama is thesun, according to the Hindu theology, and \"The sun is the source of the soulsand of all life.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu007.htm#fn_396] Agni,the \"Divine Fire,\" the deity of the Hindu, is the sun, ** for the fire and sunare the same. Ormazd is light, the Sun-God, or the Life-giver. In the Hinduphilosophy, \"The souls issue from the soul of the world, and return to it assparks to the fire.\" *** But, in another place, it is said that \"The Sun is thesoul of all things; all has proceeded out of it, and will return to it,\" ****which shows that the sun is meant allegorically here, and refers to the central,invisible sun, GOD, whose first manifestation was Sephira, the emanation ofEn-Soph--Light, in short. \"And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, anda fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it,\" says Ezekiel (i., 4,22, etc.), \". . . and the likeness of a throne . . . and as the appearance of aman above upon it . . . and I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it hadbrightness round about it.\" And Daniel speaks of the \"ancient of days,\" thekabalistic En-Soph, whose throne was \"the fiery flame, his wheels burning fire.. . . A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him.\" ***** Like thePagan Saturn, who had his castle of flame in the seventh heaven, the JewishJehovah had his \"castle of fire over the seventh heavens.\" ****** If the limited space of the present work would permit we might easily show thatnone of the ancients, the sun-worshippers included, regarded our visible sunotherwise than as an emblem of their metaphysical invisible central sun-god.Moreover, they did not believe what our modern science teaches us, namely, thatlight and heat proceed from our sun, and that it is this planet which impartsall life to our visible nature. \"His radiance is undecaying,\" says the Rig-Veda,\"the intensely-shining, all-pervading, unceasing, undecaying rays of Agni desistnot, neither night nor day.\" This evidently related to the spiritual, centralsun, whose rays are all-pervading and unceasing, the eternal and boundlesslife-giver. HE the Point; the centre (which is everywhere) of the circle (whichis nowhere), the ethereal, spiritual fire, the soul and spirit of theall-pervading, mysterious ether; the despair and puzzle of the materialist, whowill some day find that that which causes the numberless cosmic forces tomanifest themselves in eternal correlation is but a divine electricity, orrather galvanism, and that the sun is but one of the myriad magnets disseminatedthrough space--a reflector--as General Pleasonton has it. That the sun has nomore heat in it than the moon or the space-crowding host of sparkling stars.That there is no gravitation in the Newtonian sense, * but only magneticattraction and repulsion; and that it is by their magnetism that the planets ofthe solar system have their motions regulated in their respective orbits by thestill more powerful magnetism of the sun, not by their weight or gravitation.This and much more they may learn; but, until then we must be content with beingmerely laughed at, instead of being burned alive for impiety, or shut up in aninsane asylum. The laws of Manu are the doctrines of Plato, Philo, Zoroaster, Pythagoras, andof the Kabala. The esoterism of every religion may be solved by the latter. Thekabalistic doctrine of the allegorical Father and Son, or Πατερ and Λογος isidentical with the groundwork of Buddhism. Moses could not reveal to themultitude the sublime secrets of religious speculation, nor the cosmogony of theuniverse; the whole resting upon the Hindu Illusion, a clever mask veiling theSanctum Sanctorum, and which has misled so many theological commentators. ** The kabalistic heresies receive an unexpected support in the heterodox theoriesof General Pleasonton. According to his opinions (which he supports on far moreunimpeachable facts than orthodox scientists theirs) the space between the sunand the earth must be filled with a material medium, which, so far as we canjudge from his description, answers to our kabalistic astral light. The passageof light through this must produce enormous friction. Friction generateselectricity, and it is this electricity and its correlative magnetism whichforms those tremendous forces of nature that produce in, on, and about ourplanet the various changes which we everywhere encounter. He proves thatterrestrial heat cannot be directly derived from the sun, for heat ascends. Theforce by which heat is effected is a repellent one, he says, and as it isassociated with positive electricity, it is attracted to the upper atmosphere byits negative electricity, always associated with cold, which is opposed topositive electricity. He strengthens his position by showing that the earth,which when covered with snow cannot be affected by the sun's rays, is warmestwhere the snow is deepest. This he explains upon the theory that the radiationof heat from the interior of the earth, positively electrified, meeting at thesurface of the earth with the snow in contact with it, negatively electrified,produces the heat. Thus he shows that it is not at all to the sun that we are indebted for lightand heat; that light is a creation sui generis, which sprung into existence atthe instant when the Deity willed, and uttered the fiat: \"Let there be light\";and that it is this independent material agent which produces heat by friction,on account of its enormous and incessant velocity. In short, it is the firstkabalistic emanation to which General Pleasonton introduces us, that Sephira ordivine Intelligence (the female principle), which, in unity with En-Soph, ordivine wisdom (male principle) produced every thing visible and invisible. Helaughs at the current theory of the incandescence of the sun and its gaseoussubstance. The reflection from the photosphere of the sun, he says, passingthrough planetary and stellar spaces, must have thus created a vast amount ofelectricity and magnetism. Electricity, by the union of its opposite polarities,evolves heat and imparts magnetism to all substances capable of receiving it.The sun, planets, stars, and nebulae are all magnets, etc. If this courageous gentleman should prove his case, future generations will havebut little disposition to laugh at Paracelsus and his sidereal or astral light,and at his doctrine of the magnetic influence exercised by the stars and planetsupon every living creature, plant, or mineral of our globe. Moreover, if thePleasonton hypothesis is established, the transcendent glory of ProfessorTyndall will be rather obscured. According to public opinion, the General makesa terrible onslaught on the learned physicist, for attributing to the suncalorific effects experienced by him in an Alpine ramble, that were simply dueto his own vital electricity. * The prevalence of such revolutionary ideas in science, embolden us to ask therepresentatives of science whether they can explain why the tides follow themoon in her circling motion? The fact is, they cannot demonstrate even sofamiliar a phenomenon as this, one that has no mystery for even the neophytes inalchemy and magic. We would also like to learn whether they are equallyincapable of telling us why the moon's rays are so poisonous, even fatal, tosome organisms; why in some parts of Africa and India a person sleeping in themoonlight is often made insane; why the crises of certain diseases correspondwith lunar changes; why somnambulists are more affected at her full; and whygardeners, farmers, and woodmen cling so tenaciously to the idea that vegetationis affected by lunar influences? Several of the mimosae alternately open andclose their petals as the full moon emerges from or is obscured by clouds. Andthe Hindus of Travancore have a popular but extremely suggestive proverb whichsays: \"Soft words are better than harsh; the sea is attracted by the cool moonand not by the hot sun.\" Perhaps the one man or the many men who launched thisproverb on the world knew more about the cause of such attraction of the watersby the moon than we do. Thus if science cannot explain the cause of thisphysical influence, what can she know of the moral and occult influences thatmay be exercised by the celestial bodies on men and their destiny; and whycontradict that which it is impossible for her to prove false? If certainaspects of the moon effect tangible results so familiar in the experience of menthroughout all time, what violence are we doing to logic in assuming thepossibility that a certain combination of sidereal influences may also be moreor less potential? If the reader will recall what is said by the learned authors of the UnseenUniverse, as to the positive effect produced upon the universal ether by sosmall a cause as the evolution of thought in a single human brain, howreasonable will it not appear that the terrific impulses imparted to this commonmedium by the sweep of the myriad blazing orbs that are rushing through \"theinterstellar depths,\" should affect us and the earth upon which we live, in apowerful degree? If astronomers cannot explain to us the occult law by which thedrifting particles of cosmic matter aggregate into worlds, and then take theirplaces in the majestic procession which is ceaselessly moving around somecentral point of attraction, how can anyone assume to say what mystic influencesmay or may not be darting through space and affecting the issues of life uponthis and other planets? Almost nothing is known of the laws of magnetism and theother imponderable agents; almost nothing of their effects upon our bodies andminds; even that which is known and moreover perfectly demonstrated, isattributed to chance, and curious coincidences. But we do know, by thesecoincidences, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu007.htm#fn_405] that\"there are periods when certain diseases, propensities, fortunes, andmisfortunes of humanity are more rife than at others.\" There are times ofepidemic in moral and physical affairs. In one epoch \"the spirit of religiouscontroversy will arouse the most ferocious passions of which human nature issusceptible, provoking mutual persecution, bloodshed, and wars; at another, anepidemic of resistance to constituted authority will spread over half the world(as in the year 1848), rapid and simultaneous as the most virulent bodilydisorder.\" Again, the collective character of mental phenomena is illustrated by ananomalous psychological condition invading and dominating over thousands uponthousands, depriving them of everything but automatic action, and giving rise tothe popular opinion of demoniacal possession, an opinion in some sense justifiedby the satanic passions, emotions, and acts which accompany the condition. Atone period, the aggregate tendency is to retirement and contemplation; hence,the countless votaries of monachism and anchoretism; at another the mania isdirected toward action, having for its proposed end some utopian scheme, equallyimpracticable and useless; hence, the myriads who have forsaken their kindred,their homes, and their country, to seek a land whose stones were gold, or towage exterminating war for the possession of worthless cities and tracklessdeserts. ** The author from whom the above is quoted says that \"the seeds of vice and crimeappear to be sown under the surface of society, and to spring up and bring forthfruit with appalling rapidity and paralyzing succession.\" In the presence of these striking phenomena science stands speechless; she doesnot even attempt to conjecture as to their cause, and naturally, for she has notyet learned to look outside of this ball of dirt upon which we live, and itsheavy atmosphere, for the hidden influences which are affecting us day by day,and even minute by minute. But the ancients, whose \"ignorance\" is assumed by Mr.Proctor, fully realized the fact that the reciprocal relations between theplanetary bodies is as perfect as those between the corpuscles of the blood,which float in a common fluid; and that each one is affected by the combinedinfluences of all the rest, as each in its turn affects each of the others. Asthe planets differ in size, distance, and activity, so differ in intensity theirimpulses upon the ether or astral light, and the magnetic and other subtileforces radiated by them in certain aspects of the heavens. Music is thecombination and modulation of sounds, and sound is the effect produced by thevibration of the ether. Now, if the impulses communicated to the ether by thedifferent planets may be likened to the tones produced by the different notes ofa musical instrument, it is not difficult to conceive that the Pythagorean\"music of the spheres\" is something more than a mere fancy, and that certainplanetary aspects may imply disturbances in the ether of our planet, and certainothers rest and harmony. Certain kinds of music throw us into frenzy; some exaltthe soul to religious aspirations. In fine, there is scarcely a human creationwhich does not respond to certain vibrations of the atmosphere. It is the samewith colors; some excite us, some soothe and please. The nun clothes herself inblack to typify the despondency of a faith crushed under the sense of originalsin; the bride robes herself in white; red inflames the anger of certainanimals. If we and the animals are affected by vibrations acting upon a veryminute scale, why may we not be influenced in the mass by vibrations acting upona grand scale as the effect of combined stellar influences? \"We know,\" says Dr. Elam, \"that certain pathological conditions have a tendencyto become epidemic, influenced by causes not yet investigated. . . . We see howstrong is the tendency of opinion once promulgated to run into an epidemicform--no opinion, no delusion, is too absurd to assume this collectivecharacter. We observe, also, how remarkably the same ideas reproduce themselvesand reappear in successive ages; . . . no crime is too horrible to becomepopular, homicide, infanticide, suicide, poisoning, or any other diabolicalhuman conception. . . . In epidemics, the cause of the rapid spread at that particular periodremains a mystery!\" These few lines contain an undeniable psychological fact, sketched with amasterly pen, and at the same time a half-confession of utter ignorance--\"Causesnot yet investigated.\" Why not be honest and add at once, \"impossible toinvestigate with present scientific methods\"? Noticing an epidemic of incendiarism, Dr. Elam quotes from the Annales d'HygienePublique the following cases: \"A girl about seventeen years of age was arrestedon suspicion . . . she confessed that twice she had set fire to dwellings byinstinct, by irresistible necessity. . . . A boy about eighteen committed manyacts of this nature. He was not moved by any passion, but the bursting-out ofthe flames excited a profoundly pleasing emotion.\" Who but has noticed in the columns of the daily press similar incidents? Theymeet the eye constantly. In cases of murder, of every description, and of othercrimes of a diabolical character, the act is attributed, in nine cases out often, by the offenders themselves, to irresistible obsessions. \"Somethingwhispered constantly in my ear. . . . Somebody was incessantly pushing andleading me on.\" Such are the too-frequent confessions of the criminals.Physicians attribute them to hallucinations of disordered brains, and call thehomicidal impulse temporary lunacy. But is lunacy itself well understood by anypsychologist? Has its cause ever been brought under a hypothesis capable ofwithstanding the challenge of an uncompromising investigator? Let thecontroversial works of our contemporary alienists answer for themselves. Plato acknowledges man to be the toy of the element of necessity, which heenters upon in appearing in this world of matter; he is influenced by externalcauses, and these causes are daimonia, like that of Socrates. Happy is the manphysically pure, for if his external soul (body) is pure, it will strengthen thesecond one (astral body), or the soul which is termed by him the higher mortalsoul, which though liable to err from its own motives, will always side withreason against the animal proclivities of the body. The lusts of man arise inconsequence of his perishable material body, so do other diseases; but though heregards crimes as involuntary sometimes, for they result like bodily diseasefrom external causes, Plato clearly makes a wide distinction between thesecauses. The fatalism which he concedes to humanity, does not preclude thepossibility of avoiding them, for though pain, fear, anger, and other feelingsare given to men by necessity, \"if they conquered these they would liverighteously, and if they were conquered by them, unrighteously.\" * The dual man,i.e., one from whom the divine immortal spirit has departed, leaving but theanimal form and astral body (Plato's higher mortal soul), is left merely to hisinstincts, for he was conquered by all the evils entailed on matter; hence, hebecomes a docile tool in the hands of the invisibles--beings of sublimatedmatter, hovering in our atmosphere, and ever ready to inspire those who aredeservedly deserted by their immortal counsellor, the Divine Spirit, called byPlato \"genius.\" * According to this great philosopher and initiate, one \"wholived well during his appointed time would return to the habitation of his star,and there have a blessed and suitable existence. But if he failed in attainingthis in the second generation he would pass into a woman--become helpless andweak as a woman; ** and should he not cease from evil in that condition, hewould be changed into some brute, which resembled him in his evil ways, andwould not cease from his toils and transformations until he followed theoriginal principle of sameness and likeness within him, and overcame, by thehelp of reason, the latter secretions of turbulent and irrational elements(elementary daemons) composed of fire and air, and water and earth, and returnedto the form of his first and better nature.\" *** But Dr. Elam thinks otherwise. On page 194 of his book, A Physician's Problems,he says that the cause of the rapid spread of certain epidemics of disease whichhe is noticing \"remains a mystery\"; but as regards the incendiarism he remarksthat \"in all this we find nothing mysterious,\" though the epidemic is stronglydeveloped. Strange contradiction! De Quincey, in his paper, entitled MurderConsidered as One of the Fine Arts, treats of the epidemic of assassination,between 1588 and 1635, by which seven of the most distinguished characters ofthe time lost their lives at the hands of assassins, and neither he, nor anyother commentator has been able to explain the mysterious cause of thishomicidal mania. If we press these gentlemen for an explanation, which as pretended philosophersthey are bound to give us, we are answered that it is a great deal morescientific to assign for such epidemics \"agitation of the mind,\" \" . . . a timeof political excitement (1830)\" \" . . . imitation and impulse,\" \" . . .excitable and idle boys,\" and \"hysterical girls,\" than to be absurdly seekingfor the verification of superstitious traditions in a hypothetical astral light.It seems to us that if, by some providential fatality, hysteria were todisappear entirely from the human system, the medical fraternity would beentirely at a loss for explanations of a large class of phenomena nowconveniently classified under the head of \"normal symptoms of certainpathological conditions of the nervous centres.\" Hysteria has been hitherto thesheet-anchor of skeptical pathologists. Does a dirty peasant-girl begin suddenlyto speak with fluency different foreign languages hitherto unfamiliar to her,and to write poetry--\"hysterics!\" Is a medium levitated, in full view of a dozenof witnesses, and carried out of one third-story window and brought back throughanother--\"disturbance of the nervous centres, followed by a collectivehysterical delusion.\" * A Scotch terrier, caught in the room during amanifestation, is hurled by an invisible hand across the room, breaks to pieces,in his salto mortali, a chandelier, under a ceiling eighteen feet high, to falldown killed **--\"canine hallucination!\" \"True science has no belief,\" says Dr. Fenwick, in Bulwer-Lytton's StrangeStory; \"true science knows but three states of mind: denial, conviction, and thevast interval between the two, which is not belief, but the suspension ofjudgment.\" Such, perhaps, was true science in Dr. Fenwick's days. But the truescience of our modern times proceeds otherwise; it either denies point-blank,without any preliminary investigation, or sits in the interim, between denialand conviction, and, dictionary in hand, invents new Graeco-Latin appellationsfor non-existing kinds of hysteria! How often have powerful clairvoyants and adepts in mesmerism described theepidemics and physical (though to others invisible) manifestations which scienceattributes to epilepsy, haemato-nervous disorders, and what not, of somaticorigin, as their lucid vision saw them in the astral light. They affirm that the\"electric waves\" were in violent perturbation, and that they discerned a directrelation between this ethereal disturbance and the mental or physical epidemicthen raging. But science has heeded them not, but gone on with her encyclopaediclabor of devising new names for old things. \"History,\" says Du Potet, the prince of French mesmerists, \"keeps but too wellthe sad records of sorcery. These facts were but too real, and lent themselvesbut too readily to dreadful malpractices of the art, to monstrous abuse! . . .But how did I come to find out that art? Where did I learn it? In my thoughts?no; it is nature herself which discovered to me the secret. And how? Byproducing before my own eyes, without waiting for me to search for it,indisputable facts of sorcery and magic. . . . What is, after all,somnambulistic sleep? A result of the potency of magic. And what is it whichdetermines these attractions, these sudden impulses, these raving epidemics,rages, antipathies, crises;--these convulsions which you can make durable? . . .what is it which determines them, if not the very principle we employ, the agentso decidedly well known to the ancients? What you call nervous fluid ormagnetism, the men of old called occult power, or the potency of the soul,subjection, MAGIC!\" \"Magic is based on the existence of a mixed world placed without, not within us;and with which we can enter in communication by the use of certain arts andpractices. . . . An element existing in nature, unknown to most men, gets holdof a person and withers and breaks him down, as the fearful hurricane does abulrush; it scatters men far away, it strikes them in a thousand places at thesame time, without their perceiving the invisible foe, or being able to protectthemselves . . . all this is demonstrated; but that this element could choosefriends and select favorites, obey their thoughts, answer to the human voice,and understand the meaning of traced signs, that is what people cannot realize,and what their reason rejects, and that is what I saw; and I say it here mostemphatically, that for me it is a fact and a truth demonstrated for ever.\" * \"If I entered into greater details, one could readily understand that there doexist around us, as in ourselves, mysterious beings who have power and shape,who enter and go out at will, notwithstanding the well-closed doors.\" **Further, the great mesmerizer teaches us that the faculty of directing thisfluid is a \"physical property, resulting from our organization . . . it passesthrough all bodies . . . everything can be used as a conductor for magicaloperations, and it will retain the power of producing effects in its turn.\" Thisis the theory common to all hermetic philosophers. Such is the power of thefluid, \"that no chemical or physical forces are able to destroy it. . . . Thereis very little analogy between the imponderable fluids known to physicists andthis animal magnetic fluid.\" * If we now refer to mediaeval ages, we find, among others, Cornelius Agrippatelling us precisely the same: \"The ever-changing universal force, the 'soul ofthe world,' can fecundate anything by infusing in it its own celestialproperties. Arranged according to the formula taught by science, these objectsreceive the gift of communicating to us their virtue. It is sufficient to wearthem, to feel them immediately operating on the soul as on the body. . . . Humansoul possesses, from the fact of its being of the same essence as all creation,a marvellous power. One who possesses the secret is enabled to rise in scienceand knowledge as high as his imagination will carry him; but he does that onlyon the condition of becoming closely united to this universal force . . . Truth,even the future, can be then made ever present to the eyes of the soul; and thisfact has been many times demonstrated by things coming to pass as they were seenand described beforehand . . . time and space vanish before the eagle eye of theimmortal soul . . . her power becomes boundless . . . she can shoot throughspace and envelop with her presence a man, no matter at what distance; she canplunge and penetrate him through, and make him hear the voice of the person shebelongs to, as if that person were in the room.\" ** If unwilling to seek for proof or receive information from mediaeval, hermeticphilosophy, we may go still further back into antiquity, and select, out of thegreat body of philosophers of the pre-Christian ages, one who can least beaccused of superstition and credulity--Cicero. Speaking of those whom he callsgods, and who are either human or atmospheric spirits, \"We know,\" says the oldorator, \"that of all living beings man is the best formed, and, as the godsbelong to this number, they must have a human form. . . . I do not mean to saythat the gods have body and blood in them; but I say that they seem as if theyhad bodies with blood in them. . . . Epicurus, for whom hidden things were astangible as if he had touched them with his finger, teaches us that gods are notgenerally visible, but that they are intelligible; that they are not bodieshaving a certain solidity . . . but that we can recognize them by their passingimages; that as there are atoms enough in the infinite space to produce suchimages, these are produced before us . . . and make us realize what are thesehappy, immortal beings.\" *** \"When the initiate,\" says Levi, in his turn, \"has become quite lucide, hecommunicates and directs at will the magnetic vibrations in the mass of astrallight. . . . Transformed in human light at the moment of the conception, it (thelight) becomes the first envelope of the soul; by combination with the subtlestfluids it forms an ethereal body, or the sidereal phantom, which is entirelydisengaged only at the moment of death.\" * To project this ethereal body, at nomatter what distance; to render it more objective and tangible by condensingover its fluidic form the waves of the parent essence, is the great secret ofthe adept-magician. Theurgical magic is the last expression of occult psychological science. TheAcademicians reject it as the hallucination of diseased brains, or brand it withthe opprobrium of charlatanry. We deny to them most emphatically the right ofexpressing their opinion on a subject which they have never investigated. Theyhave no more right, in their present state of knowledge, to judge of magic andSpiritualism than a Fiji islander to venture his opinion about the labors ofFaraday or Agassiz. About all they can do on any one day is to correct theerrors of the preceding day. Nearly three thousand years ago, earlier than thedays of Pythagoras, the ancient philosophers claimed that light wasponderable--hence matter, and that light was force. The corpuscular theory,owing to certain Newtonian failures to account for it, was laughed down, and theundulatory theory, which proclaimed light imponderable, accepted. And now theworld is startled by Mr.Crookes weighing light with his radiometer! ThePythagoreans held that neither the sun nor the stars were the sources of lightand heat, and that the former was but an agent; but the modern schools teach thecontrary. The same may be said respecting the Newtonian law of gravitation. Followingstrictly the Pythagorean doctrine, Plato held that gravitation was not merely alaw of the magnetic attraction of lesser bodies to larger ones, but a magneticrepulsion of similars and attraction of dissimilars. \"Things brought together,\"says he, \"contrary to nature, are naturally at war, and repel one another.\" **This cannot be taken to mean that repulsion occurs of necessity between bodiesof dissimilar properties, but simply that when naturally antagonistic bodies arebrought together they repel one another. The researches of Bart and Schweiggerleave us in little or no doubt that the ancients were well acquainted with themutual attractions of iron and the lodestone, as well as with the positive andnegative properties of electricity, by whatever name they may have called it.The reciprocal magnetic relations of the planetary orbs, which are all magnets,was with them an accepted fact, and aerolites were not only called by themmagnetic stones, but used in the Mysteries for purposes to which we now applythe magnet. When, therefore, Professor A. M. Mayer, of the Stevens Institute ofTechnology, in 1872, told the Yale Scientific Club that the earth is a greatmagnet, and that \"on any sudden agitation of the sun's surface the magnetism ofthe earth receives a profound disturbance in its equilibrium, causing fitfultremors in the magnets of our observatories, and producing those grand outburstsof the polar lights, whose lambent flames dance in rhythm to the quiveringneedle,\" * he only restated, in good English, what was taught in good Doricuntold centuries before the first Christian philosopher saw the light. The prodigies accomplished by the priests of theurgical magic are so wellauthenticated, and the evidence--if human testimony is worth anything at all--isso overwhelming, that, rather than confess that the Pagan theurgists faroutrivalled the Christians in miracles, Sir David Brewster piously concedes tothe former the greatest proficiency in physics, and everything that pertains tonatural philosophy. Science finds herself in a very disagreeable dilemma. Shemust either confess that the ancient physicists were superior in knowledge toher modern representatives, or that there exists something in nature beyondphysical science, and that spirit possesses powers of which our philosophersnever dreamed. \"The mistake we make in some science we have specially cultivated,\" saysBulwer-Lytton, \"is often only to be seen by the light of a separate science asespecially cultivated by another.\" ** Nothing can be easier accounted for than the highest possibilities of magic. Bythe radiant light of the universal magnetic ocean, whose electric waves bind thecosmos together, and in their ceaseless motion penetrate every atom and moleculeof the boundless creation, the disciples of mesmerism--howbeit insufficienttheir various experiments--intuitionally perceive the alpha and omega of thegreat mystery. Alone, the study of this agent, which is the divine breath, canunlock the secrets of psychology and physiology, of cosmical and spiritualphenomena. \"Magic,\" says Psellus, \"formed the last part of the sacerdotal science. Itinvestigated the nature, power, and quality of everything sublunary; of theelements and their parts, of animals, all various plants and their fruits, ofstones and herbs. In short, it explored the essence and power of everything.From hence, therefore, it produced its effects. And it formed statues (magnetized) which procure health, and made all variousfigures and things (talismans) which could equally become the instruments ofdisease as well as of health. Often, too, celestial fire is made to appearthrough magic, and then statues laugh and lamps are spontaneously enkindled.\" * If Galvani's modern discovery can set in motion the limbs of a dead frog, andforce a dead man's face to express, by the distortion of its features, the mostvaried emotions, from joy to diabolical rage, despair, and horror, the Paganpriests, unless the combined evidence of the most trustworthy men of antiquityis not to be relied upon, accomplished the still greater wonders of making theirstone and metal statues to sweat and laugh. The celestial, pure fire of thePagan altar was electricity drawn from the astral light. Statues, therefore, ifproperly prepared, might, without any accusation of superstition, be allowed tohave the property of imparting health and disease by contact, as well as anymodern galvanic belt, or overcharged battery. Scholastic skeptics, as well as ignorant materialists, have greatly amusedthemselves for the last two centuries over the absurdities attributed toPythagoras by his biographer, Iamblichus. The Samian philosopher is said to havepersuaded a she-bear to give up eating human flesh; to have forced a white eagleto descend to him from the clouds, and to have subdued him by stroking himgently with the hand, and by talking to him. On another occasion, Pythagorasactually persuaded an ox to renounce eating beans, by merely whispering in theanimal's ear! ** Oh, ignorance and superstition of our forefathers, howridiculous they appear in the eyes of our enlightened generations! Let us,however, analyze this absurdity. Every day we see unlettered men, proprietors ofstrolling menageries, taming and completely subduing the most ferocious animals,merely by the power of their irresistible will. Nay, we have at the presentmoment in Europe several young and physically-weak girls, under twenty years ofage, fearlessly doing the same thing. Every one has either witnessed or heard ofthe seemingly magical power of some mesmerizers and psychologists. They are ableto subjugate their patients for any length of time. Regazzoni, the mesmerist whoexcited such wonder in France and London, has achieved far more extraordinaryfeats than what is above attributed to Pythagoras. Why, then, accuse the ancientbiographers of such men as Pythagoras and Apollonius of Tyana of either wilfulmisrepresentation or absurd superstition? When we realize that the majority ofthose who are so skeptical as to the magical powers possessed by the ancientphilosophers, who laugh at the old theogonies and the fallacies of mythology,nevertheless have an implicit faith in the records and inspiration of theirBible, hardly daring to doubt even that monstrous absurdity that Joshua arrestedthe course of the sun, we may well say Amen to Godfrey Higgins' just rebuke:\"When I find,\" he says, \"learned men believing Genesis literally, which theancients, with all their failings, had too much sense to receive exceptallegorically, I am tempted to doubt the reality of the improvement of the humanmind.\" * One of the very few commentators on old Greek and Latin authors, who have giventheir just dues to the ancients for their mental development, is Thomas Taylor.In his translation of Iamblichus' Life of Pythagoras, we find him remarking asfollows: \"Since Pythagoras, as Iamblichus informs us, was initiated in all theMysteries of Byblus and Tyre, in the sacred operations of the Syrians, and inthe Mysteries of the Phoenicians, and also that he spent two and twenty years inthe adyta of temples in Egypt, associated with the magians in Babylon, and wasinstructed by them in their venerable knowledge, it is not at all wonderful thathe was skilled in magic, or theurgy, and was therefore able to perform thingswhich surpass merely human power, and which appear to be perfectly incredible tothe vulgar.\" ** The universal ether was not, in their eyes, simply a something stretching,tenantless, throughout the expanse of heaven; it was a boundless ocean peopledlike our familiar seas with monstrous and minor creatures, and having in itsevery molecule the germs of life. Like the finny tribes which swarm in ouroceans and smaller bodies of water, each kind having its habitat in some spot towhich it is curiously adapted, some friendly and some inimical to man, somepleasant and some frightful to behold, some seeking the refuge of quiet nooksand land-locked harbors, and some traversing great areas of water, the variousraces of the elemental spirits were believed by them to inhabit the differentportions of the great ethereal ocean, and to be exactly adapted to theirrespective conditions. If we will only bear in mind the fact that the rushing ofplanets through space must create as absolute a disturbance in this plastic andattenuated medium, as the passage of a cannon shot does in the air or that of asteamer in the water, and on a cosmic scale, we can understand that certainplanetary aspects, admitting our premises to be true, may produce much moreviolent agitation and cause much stronger currents to flow in a given direction,than others. With the same premises conceded, we may also see why, by suchvarious aspects of the stars, shoals of friendly or hostile \"elementals\" mightbe poured in upon our atmosphere, or some particular portion of it, and make thefact appreciable by the effects which ensue. According to the ancient doctrines, the soulless elemental spirits were evolvedby the ceaseless motion inherent in the astral light. Light is force, and thelatter is produced by the will. As this will proceeds from an intelligence whichcannot err, for it has nothing of the material organs of human thought in it,being the superfine pure emanation of the highest divinity itself--(Plato's\"Father\") it proceeds from the beginning of time, according to immutable laws,to evolve the elementary fabric requisite for subsequent generations of what weterm human races. All of the latter, whether belonging to this planet or to someother of the myriads in space, have their earthly bodies evolved in the matrixout of the bodies of a certain class of these elemental beings which have passedaway in the invisible worlds. In the ancient philosophy there was no missinglink to be supplied by what Tyndall calls an \"educated imagination\"; no hiatusto be filled with volumes of materialistic speculations made necessary by theabsurd attempt to solve an equation with but one set of quantities; our\"ignorant\" ancestors traced the law of evolution throughout the whole universe.As by gradual progression from the star-cloudlet to the development of thephysical body of man, the rule holds good, so from the universal ether to theincarnate human spirit, they traced one uninterrupted series of entities. Theseevolutions were from the world of spirit into the world of gross matter; andthrough that back again to the source of all things. The \"descent of species\"was to them a descent from the spirit, primal source of all, to the \"degradationof matter.\" In this complete chain of unfoldings the elementary, spiritualbeings had as distinct a place, midway between the extremes, as Mr. Darwin'smissing-link between the ape and man. No author in the world of literature ever gave a more truthful or more poeticaldescription of these beings than Sir E. Bulwer-Lytton, the author of Zanoni.Now, himself \"a thing not of matter\" but an \"Idea of joy and light,\" his wordssound more like the faithful echo of memory than the exuberant outflow of mereimagination. \"Man is arrogant in proportion of his ignorance,\" he makes the wise Mejnour sayto Glyndon. \"For several ages he saw in the countless worlds that sparklethrough space like the bubbles of a shoreless ocean, only the petty candles . .. that Providence has been pleased to light for no other purpose but to make thenight more agreeable to man. . . . Astronomy has corrected this delusion ofhuman vanity, and man now reluctantly confesses that the stars are worlds,larger and more glorious than his own. . . . Everywhere, then, in this immensedesign, science brings new life to light. . . . Reasoning, then, by evidentanalogy, if not a leaf, if not a drop of water, but is, no less than yonderstar, a habitable and breathing world--nay, if even man himself, is a world toother lives, and millions and myriads dwell in the rivers of his blood, andinhabit man's frame, as man inhabits earth--common sense (if our schoolmen hadit) would suffice to teach that the circumfluent infinite which you callspace--the boundless impalpable which divides earth from the moon and stars--isfilled also with its correspondent and appropriate life. Is it not a visibleabsurdity to suppose that being is crowded upon every leaf, and yet absent fromthe immensities of space! The law of the great system forbids the waste even ofan atom; it knows no spot where something of life does not breathe. . . . Well,then, can you conceive that space, which is the infinite itself, is alone awaste, is alone lifeless, is less useful to the one design of universal being .. . than the peopled leaf, than the swarming globule? The microscope shows youthe creatures on the leaf; no mechanical tube is yet invented to discover thenobler and more gifted things that hover in the illimitable air. Yet betweenthese last and man is a mysterious and terrible affinity. . . . But first, topenetrate this barrier, the soul with which you listen must be sharpened byintense enthusiasm, purified from all earthly desires. . . . When thus prepared,science can be brought to aid it; the sight itself may be rendered more subtile,the nerves more acute, the spirit more alive and outward, and the elementitself--the air, the space--may be made, by certain secrets of the higherchemistry, more palpable and clear. And this, too, is not magic as the credulouscall it; as I have so often said before, magic (a science that violates nature)exists not; it is but the science by which nature can be controlled. Now, inspace there are millions of beings, not literally spiritual, for they have all,like the animalcula unseen by the naked eye, certain forms of matter, thoughmatter so delicate, air-drawn, and subtile, that it is, as it were, but a film,a gossamer, that clothes the spirit. . . . Yet, in truth, these races differmost widely . . . some of surpassing wisdom, some of horrible malignity; somehostile as fiends to men, others gentle as messengers between earth and heaven.. . . Amid the dwellers of the threshold is one, too, surpassing in malignityand hatred all her tribe; one whose eyes have paralyzed the bravest, and whosepower increases over the spirit precisely in proportion to its fear.\" * Such is the insufficient sketch of elemental beings void of divine spirit, givenby one whom many with reason believed to know more than he was prepared to admitin the face of an incredulous public. In the following chapter we will contrive to explain some of the esotericspeculations of the initiates of the sanctuary, as to what man was, is, and mayyet be. The doctrines they taught in the Mysteries--the source from which sprangthe Old and partially the New Testament, belonged to the most advanced notionsof morality, and religious revelations. While the literal meaning was abandonedto the fanaticism of the unreasoning lower classes of society, the higher ones,the majority of which consisted of Initiates, pursued their studies in thesolemn silence of the temples, and their worship of the one God of Heaven. The speculations of Plato, in the Banquet, on the creation of the primordialmen, and the essay on Cosmogony in the Timaeus, must be taken allegorically, ifwe accept them at all. It is this hidden Pythagorean meaning in Timaeus,Cratylus, and Parmenides, and a few other trilogies and dialogues, that theNeo-platonists ventured to expound, as far as the theurgical vow of secrecywould allow them. The Pythagorean doctrine that God is the universal minddiffused through all things, and the dogma of the soul's immortality, are theleading features in these apparently incongruous teachings. His piety and thegreat veneration Plato felt for the MYSTERIES, are sufficient warrant that hewould not allow his indiscretion to get the better of that deep sense ofresponsibility which is felt by every adept. \"Constantly perfecting himself inperfect MYSTERIES, a man in them alone becomes truly perfect,\" says he in thePhaedrus. * He took no pains to conceal his displeasure that the Mysteries had become lesssecret than formerly. Instead of profaning them by putting them within the reachof the multitude, he would have guarded them with jealous care against all butthe most earnest and worthy of his disciples. ** While mentioning the gods, onevery page, his monotheism is unquestionable, for the whole thread of hisdiscourse indicates that by the term gods he means a class of beings far lowerin the scale than deities, and but one grade higher than men. Even Josephusperceived and acknowledged this fact, despite the natural prejudice of his race.In his famous onslaught upon Apion, this historian says: *** \"Those, however,among the Greeks who philosophized in accordance with truth, were not ignorantof anything . . . nor did they fail to perceive the chilling superficialities ofthe mythical allegories, on which account they justly despised them. . . . Bywhich thing Plato, being moved, says it is not necessary to admit any one of theother poets into 'the Commonwealth,' and he dismisses Homer blandly, afterhaving crowned him and pouring unguent upon him, in order that indeed he shouldnot destroy, by his myths, the orthodox belief respecting one God.\" Those who can discern the true spirit of Plato's philosophy, will hardly besatisfied with the estimate of the same which Jowett lays before his readers. Hetells us that the influence exercised upon posterity by the Timaeus is partlydue to a misunderstanding of the doctrine of its author by the Neo-platonists.He would have us believe that the hidden meanings which they found in thisDialogue, are \"quite at variance with the spirit of Plato.\" This is equivalentto the assumption that Jowett understands what this spirit really was; whereashis criticism upon this particular topic rather indicates that he did notpenetrate it at all. If, as he tells us, the Christians seem to find in his worktheir trinity, the word, the church, and the creation of the world, in a Jewishsense, it is because all this is there, and therefore it is but natural thatthey should have found it. The outward building is the same; but the spiritwhich animated the dead letter of the philosopher's teaching has fled, and wewould seek for it in vain through the arid dogmas of Christian theology. TheSphinx is the same now, as it was four centuries before the Christian era; butthe OEdipus is no more. He is slain because he has given to the world that whichthe world was not ripe enough to receive. He was the embodiment of truth, and hehad to die, as every grand truth has to, before, like the Phoenix of old, itrevives from its own ashes. Every translator of Plato's works remarked thestrange similarity between the philosophy of the esoterists and the Christiandoctrines, and each of them has tried to interpret it in accordance with his ownreligious feelings. So Cory, in his Ancient Fragments, tries to prove that it isbut an outward resemblance; and does his best to lower the Pythagorean Monad inthe public estimation and exalt upon its ruins the later anthropomorphic deity.Taylor, advocating the former, acts as unceremoniously with the Mosaic God.Zeller boldly laughs at the pretensions of the Fathers of the Church, who,notwithstanding history and its chronology, and whether people will have it ornot, insist that Plato and his school have robbed Christianity of its leadingfeatures. It is as fortunate for us as it is unfortunate for the Roman Churchthat such clever sleight-of-hand as that resorted to by Eusebius is ratherdifficult in our century. It was easier to pervert chronology \"for the sake ofmaking synchronisms,\" in the days of the Bishop of Caesarea, than it is now, andwhile history exists, no one can help people knowing that Plato lived 600 yearsbefore Irenaeus took it into his head to establish a new doctrine from the ruinsof Plato's older Academy. This doctrine of God being the universal mind diffused through all things,underlies all ancient philosophies. The Buddhistic tenets which can never bebetter comprehended than when studying the Pythagorean philosophy--its faithfulreflection--are derived from this source as well as the Brahmanical religion andearly Christianity. The purifying process of transmigrations--themetempsychoses--however grossly anthropomorphized at a later period, must onlybe regarded as a supplementary doctrine, disfigured by theological sophistrywith the object of getting a firmer hold upon believers through a popularsuperstition. Neither Gautama Buddha nor Pythagoras intended to teach thispurely-metaphysical allegory literally. Esoterically, it is explained in the\"Mystery\" of the Kounboum, * and relates to the purely spiritual peregrinationsof the human soul. It is not in the dead letter of Buddhistical sacredliterature that scholars may hope to find the true solution of its metaphysicalsubtilties. The latter weary the power of thought by the inconceivableprofundity of its ratiocination; and the student is never farther from truththan when he believes himself nearest its discovery. The mastery of everydoctrine of the perplexing Buddhist system can be attained only by proceedingstrictly according to the Pythagorean and Platonic method; from universals downto particulars. The key to it lies in the refined and mystical tenets of thespiritual influx of divine life. \"Whoever is unacquainted with my law,\" saysBuddha, \"and dies in that state, must return to the earth till he becomes aperfect Samanean. To achieve this object, he must destroy within himself thetrinity of Maya. ** He must extinguish his passions, unite and identify himselfwith the law (the teaching of the secret doctrine), and comprehend the religionof annihilation.\" Here, annihilation refers but to matter, that of the visible as well as of theinvisible body; for the astral soul (perisprit) is still matter, howeversublimated. The same book says that what Fo (Buddha) meant to say was, that \"theprimitive substance is eternal and unchangeable. Its highest revelation is thepure, luminous ether, the boundless infinite space, not a void resulting fromthe absence of forms, but, on the contrary, the foundation of all forms, andanterior to them. But the very presence of forms denotes it to be the creationof Maya, and all her works are as nothing before the uncreated being, SPIRIT, inwhose profound and sacred repose all motion must cease forever.\" Thus annihilation means, with the Buddhistical philosophy, only a dispersion ofmatter, in whatever form or semblance of form it may be; for everything thatbears a shape was created, and thus must sooner or later perish, i.e., changethat shape; therefore, as something temporary, though seeming to be permanent,it is but an illusion, Maya; for, as eternity has neither beginning nor end, themore or less prolonged duration of some particular form passes, as it were, likean instantaneous flash of lightning. Before we have the time to realize that wehave seen it, it is gone and passed away for ever; hence, even our astralbodies, pure ether, are but illusions of matter, so long as they retain theirterrestrial outline. The latter changes, says the Buddhist, according to themerits or demerits of the person during his lifetime, and this ismetempsychosis. When the spiritual entity breaks loose for ever from everyparticle of matter, then only it enters upon the eternal and unchangeableNirvana. He exists in spirit, in nothing; as a form, a shape, a semblance, he iscompletely annihilated, and thus will die no more, for spirit alone is no Maya,but the only REALITY in an illusionary universe of ever-passing forms. It is upon this Buddhist doctrine that the Pythagoreans grounded the principaltenets of their philosophy. \"Can that spirit, which gives life and motion, andpartakes of the nature of light, be reduced to non-entity?\" they ask. \"Can thatsensitive spirit in brutes which exercises memory, one of the rationalfaculties, die, and become nothing?\" And Whitelock Bulstrode, in his abledefence of Pythagoras, expounds this doctrine by adding: \"If you say, they (thebrutes) breathe their spirits into the air, and there vanish, that is all Icontend for. The air, indeed, is the proper place to receive them, being,according to Laertius, full of souls; and, according to Epicurus, full of atoms,the principles of all things; for even this place wherein we walk and birds flyhas so much of a spiritual nature, that it is invisible, and, therefore, maywell be the receiver of forms, since the forms of all bodies are so; we can onlysee and hear its effects; the air itself is too fine, and above the capacity ofthe age. What then is the ether in the region above, and what are the influencesor forms that descend from thence?\" The spirits of creatures, the Pythagoreanshold, who are emanations of the most sublimated portions of ether, emanations,BREATHS, but not forms. Ether is incorruptible, all philosophers agree in that;and what is incorruptible is so far from being annihilated when it gets rid ofthe form, that it lays a good claim to IMMORTALITY. \"But what is that which hasno body, no form; which is imponderable, invisible and indivisible; that whichexists and yet is not?\" ask the Buddhists. \"It is Nirvana,\" is the answer. It isNOTHING, not a region, but rather a state. When once Nirvana is reached, man isexempt from the effects of the \"four truths\"; for an effect can only be producedthrough a certain cause, and every cause is annihilated in this state. These \"four truths\" are the foundation of the whole Buddhist doctrine ofNirvana. They are, says the book of Pradjna Paramita, * 1. The existence ofpain. 2. The production of pain. 3. The annihilation of pain. 4. The way to theannihilation of pain. What is the source of pain?--Existence. Birth existing,decrepitude and death ensue; for wherever there is a form, there is a cause forpain and suffering. Spirit alone has no form, and therefore cannot be said toexist. Whenever man (the ethereal, inner man) reaches that point when he becomesutterly spiritual, hence, formless, he has reached a state of perfect bliss. MANas an objective being becomes annihilated, but the spiritual entity with itssubjective life, will live for ever, for spirit is incorruptible and immortal. It is by the spirit of the teachings of both Buddha and Pythagoras, that we canso easily recognize the identity of their doctrines. The all-pervading,universal soul, the Anima Mundi, is Nirvana; and Buddha, as a generic name, isthe anthropomorphized monad of Pythagoras. When resting in Nirvana, the finalbliss, Buddha is the silent monad, dwelling in darkness and silence; he is alsothe formless Brahm, the sublime but unknowable Deity, which pervades invisiblythe whole universe. Whenever it is manifested, desiring to impress itself uponhumanity in a shape intelligent to our intellect, whether we call it an avatar,or a King Messiah, or a permutation of Divine Spirit, Logos, Christos, it is allone and the same thing. In each case it is \"the Father,\" who is in the Son, andthe Son in \"the Father.\" The immortal spirit overshadows the mortal man. Itenters into him, and pervading his whole being, makes of him a god, who descendsinto his earthly tabernacle. Every man may become a Buddha, says the doctrine.And so throughout the interminable series of ages we find now and then men whomore or less succeed in uniting themselves \"with God,\" as the expression goes,with their own spirit, as we ought to translate. The Buddhists call such menArhat. An Arhat is next to a Buddha, and none is equal to him either in infusedscience, or miraculous powers. Certain fakirs demonstrate the theory well inpractice, as Jacolliot has proved. Even the so-called fabulous narratives of certain Buddhistical books, whenstripped of their allegorical meaning, are found to be the secret doctrinestaught by Pythagoras. In the Pali Books called the Jutakas, are given the 550incarnations or metempsychoses of Buddha. They narrate how he has appeared inevery form of animal life, and animated every sentient being on earth, frominfinitesimal insect to the bird, the beast, and finally man, the microcosmicimage of God on earth. Must this be taken literally; is it intended as adescription of the actual transformations and existence of one and the sameindividual immortal, divine spirit, which by turns has animated every kind ofsentient being? Ought we not rather to understand, with Buddhist metaphysicians,that though the individual human spirits are numberless, collectively they areone, as every drop of water drawn out of the ocean, metaphorically speaking, mayhave an individual existence and still be one with the rest of the drops goingto form that ocean; for each human spirit is a scintilla of the oneall-pervading light? That this divine spirit animates the flower, the particleof granite on the mountain side, the lion, the man? Egyptian Hierophants, likethe Brahmans, and the Buddhists of the East, and some Greek philosophers,maintained originally that the same spirit that animates the particle of dust,lurking latent in it, animates man, manifesting itself in him in its higheststate of activity. The doctrine, also, of a gradual refusion of the human soulinto the essence of the primeval parent spirit, was universal at one time. Butthis doctrine never implied annihilation of the higher spiritual ego--only thedispersion of the external forms of man, after his terrestrial death, as well asduring his abode on earth. Who is better fitted to impart to us the mysteries ofafter-death, so erroneously thought impenetrable, than those men who having,through self-discipline and purity of life and purpose, succeeded in unitingthemselves with their \"God,\" were afforded some glimpses, however imperfect, ofthe great truth. * And these seers tell us strange stories about the variety offorms assumed by disembodied astral souls; forms of which each one is aspiritual though concrete reflection of the abstract state of the mind, andthoughts of the once living man. To accuse Buddhistical philosophy of rejecting a Supreme Being--God, and thesoul's immortality, of atheism, in short, on the ground that according to theirdoctrines, Nirvana means annihilation, and Svabhavat is NOT a person, butnothing, is simply absurd. The En (or Ayin) of the Jewish En-Soph, also meansnihil or nothing, that which is not (quo ad nos); but no one has ever venturedto twit the Jews with atheism. In both cases the real meaning of the termnothing carries with it the idea that God is not a thing, not a concrete orvisible Being to which a name expressive of any object known to us on earth maybe applied with propriety.

Kepler, the eminent astronomer, fully credited the idea thatthe stars and all heavenly bodies, even our earth, are endowed with living andthinking souls. 254:* We are not aware that a copy of this ancient work is embraced in thecatalogue of any European library; but it is one of the \"Books of Hermes,\" andit is referred to and quotations are made from it in the works of a number ofancient and mediaeval philosophical authors.

What proof have we of the fact? It was only the literati whoexhibited such an ignorance. Even so early as the time of Pythagoras, the Paganstaught it, Plutarch testifies to it, and Socrates died for it. Besides, as wehave stated repeatedly, all knowledge was concentrated in the sanctuaries of thetemples from whence it very rarely spread itself among the uninitiated. If thesages and priests of the remotest antiquity were not aware of this astronomicaltruth, how is it that they represented Kneph, the spirit of the first hour, withan egg placed on his lips, the egg signifying our globe, to which he impartslife by his breath. Moreover, if, owing to the difficulty of consulting theChaldean \"Book of Numbers,\" our critics should demand the citation of otherauthorities, we can refer them to Diogenes Laertius, who credits Manetho withhaving taught that the earth was in the shape of a ball. Besides, the sameauthor, quoting most probably from the \"Compendium of Natural Philosophy,\" givesthe following statements of the Egyptian doctrine: \"The beginning is matterαρχεν μευ ειναι τεν ὑλεν, and from it the four elements separated. . . . Thetrue form of God is unknown; but the world had a beginning and is thereforeperishable. . . . The moon is eclipsed when it crosses the shadow of the earth\"(Diogenes Laertius: \"Prooein,\" §§ 10, 11). Besides, Pythagoras is credited withhaving taught that the earth was round, that it rotated, and was but a planetlike any other of these celestial bodies. (See Fenelon's \"Lives of thePhilosophers.\") In the latest of Plato's translations (\"The Dialogues of Plato,\"by Professor Jowett), the author, in his introduction to \"Timaeus,\"notwithstanding \"an unfortunate doubt\" which arises in consequence of the wordιλλεσθαι capable of being translated either \"circling\" or \"compacted,\" feelsinclined to credit Plato with having been familiar with the rotation of theearth. Plato's doctrine is expressed in the following words: \"The earth which isour nurse (compacted or) circling around the pole which is extended through theuniverse.\" But if we are to believe Proclus and Simplicius, Aristotle understoodthis word in \"Timaeus\" \"to mean circling or revolving\" (De Coelo), and Mr.Jowett himself further admits that \"Aristotle attributed to Plato the doctrineof the rotation of the earth.\" (See vol. ii. of \"Dial. of Plato.\" Introductionto \"Timaeus,\" pp. 501-2.) It would have been extraordinary, to say the least,that Plato, who was such an admirer of Pythagoras and who certainly must havehad, as an initiate, access to the most secret doctrines of the great Samian,should be ignorant of such an elementary astronomical truth. 256:*** \"Wisdom of Solomon,\" xi. 17. 257:* Eugenius Philalethes: \"Magia Adamica.\" 258:* Hargrave Jennings: \"The Rosicrucians.\" 258:** \"Timaeus.\" 259:* \"Our Place among Infinities,\" p. 313. 259:** Ibid. 259:*** Ibid., p. 314. 260:* The library of a relative of the writer contains a copy of a Frenchedition of this unique work.

Thisexperimentalist boldly comes out as a revolutionist of modern science, and callsNewton's centripetal and centrifugal forces, and the law of gravitation,\"fallacies.\" He fearlessly maintains his ground against the Tyndalls and Huxleysof the day. We are glad to find such a learned defender of one of the oldest(and hitherto treated as the most absurd) of hermetic hallucinations (?) (SeeGeneral Pleasonton's book, \"The Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight, andof the Blue Color of the Sky, in developing Animal and Vegetable Life,\"addressed to the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture.) 271:** In no country were the true esoteric doctrines trusted to writing. TheHindu Brahma Maia, was passed from one generation to another by oral tradition.The Kabala was never written; and Moses intrusted it orally but to his elect.The primitive pure Oriental gnosticism was completely corrupted and degraded bythe different subsequent sects. Philo, in the \"de Sacrificiis Abeli et Caini,\"states that there is a mystery not to be revealed to the uninitiated. Plato issilent on many things, and his disciples refer to this fact constantly. Any onewho has studied, even superficially, these philosophers, on reading theinstitutes of Manu, will clearly perceive that they all drew from the samesource. \"This universe,\" says Manu, \"existed only in the first divine idea, yetunexpanded, as if involved in darkness, imperceptible, indefinable,undiscoverable by reason, and undiscovered by revelation, as if it were whollyimmersed in sleep; then the sole self-existing Power himself undiscerned,appeared with undiminished glory, expanding his idea, or dispelling the gloom.\"Thus speaks the first code of Buddhism. Plato's idea is the Will, or Logos, thedeity which manifests itself. It is the Eternal Light from which proceeds, as anemanation, the visible and material light. 273:* It appears that in descending from Mont Blanc, Tyndall suffered severelyfrom the heat, though he was knee-deep in the snow at the time. The Professorattributed this to the burning rays of the sun, but Pleasonton maintains that ifthe rays of the sun had been so intense as described, they would have melted thesnow, which they did not; he concludes that the heat from which the Professorsuffered came from his own body, and was due to the electrical action ofsunlight upon his dark woolen clothes, which had become electrified positivelyby the heat of his body. The cold, dry ether of planetary space and the upperatmosphere of the earth became negatively electrified, and falling upon his warmbody and clothes, positively electrified, evolved an increased heat (see \"TheInfluence of the Blue Ray,\" etc., pp. 39, 40, 41, etc.). 274:* The most curious of all \"curious coincidences,\" to our mind is, that ourmen of science should put aside facts, striking enough to cause them to use suchan expression when speaking of them, instead of setting to work to give us aphilosophical explanation of the same. 274:** See Charles Elam, M. D.: \"A Physician's Problems,\" London, 1869, p. 159. 276:* Jowett: \"Timaeus.\" 277:* Ibid. 277:** According to General Pleasonton's theory of positive and negativeelectricity underlying every psychological, physiological, and cosmic phenomena,the abuse of alcoholic stimulants transforms a man into a woman and vice versa,by changing their electricities. \"When this change in the condition of hiselectricity has occurred,\" says the author, \"his attributes (those of adrunkard) become feminine; he is irritable, irrational, excitable . . . becomesviolent, and if he meets his wife, whose normal condition of electricity is likehis present condition, positive, they repel each other, become mutually abusive,engage in conflict and deadly strife, and the newspapers of the next dayannounce the verdict of the coroner's jury on the case. . . . Who would expectto find the discovery of the moving cause of all these terrible crimes in theperspiration of the criminal? and yet science has shown that the metamorphosesof a man into a woman, by changing the negative condition of his electricityinto the positive electricity of the woman, with all its attributes, isdisclosed by the character of his perspiration, superinduced by the use ofalcoholic stimulants\" (\"The Influence of the Blue Ray,\" p. 119). 277:*** Plato: \"Timaeus.\" 278:* Littre: \"Revue des Deux Mondes.\" 278:** See des Mousseaux's \"Œuvres des Demons.\" 279:* Du Potet: \"Magie Devoilee,\" pp. 51-147. 279:** Ibid., p. 201. 280:* Baron Du Potet: \"Cours de Magnetisme,\" pp. 17-108. 280:** \"De Occulto Philosophia,\" pp. 332-358. 280:*** Cicero: \"De Natura Deorum,\" lib. i., cap. xviii. 281:* Eliphas Levi. 281:** \"Timaeus.\" Such like expressions made Professor Jowett state in hisIntroduction that Plato taught the attraction of similar bodies to similar.

It may be that we shallfind as much reason to credit the ancients with originality in this direction asin that which we have been considering. To our mind, no stronger proof of thetheory of cyclical progression need be required than the comparativeenlightenment of former ages and that of the Patristic Church, as regards theform of the earth, and the movements of the planetary system. Even were otherevidence wanting, the ignorance of Augustine and Lactantius, misleading thewhole of Christendom upon these questions until the period of Galileo, wouldmark the eclipses through which human knowledge passes from age to age. The \"coats of skin,\" mentioned in the third chapter of Genesis as given to Adamand Eve, are explained by certain ancient philosophers to mean the fleshy bodieswith which, in the progress of the cycles, the progenitors of the race becameclothed. They maintained that the god-like physical form became grosser andgrosser, until the bottom of what may be termed the last spiritual cycle wasreached, and mankind entered upon the ascending arc of the first human cycle.Then began an uninterrupted series of cycles or yugas; the precise number ofyears of which each of them consisted remaining an inviolable mystery within theprecincts of the sanctuaries and disclosed only to the initiates. As soon ashumanity entered upon a new one, the stone age, with which the preceding cyclehad closed, began to gradually merge into the following and next higher age.With each successive age, or epoch, men grew more refined, until the acme ofperfection possible in that particular cycle had been reached. Then the recedingwave of time carried back with it the vestiges of human, social, andintellectual progress. Cycle succeeded cycle, by imperceptible transitions;highly-civilized flourishing nations, waxed in power, attained the climax ofdevelopment, waned, and became extinct; and mankind, when the end of the lowercyclic arc was reached, was replunged into barbarism as at the start. Kingdomshave crumbled and nation succeeded nation from the beginning until our day, theraces alternately mounting to the highest and descending to the lowest points ofdevelopment. Draper observes that there is no reason to suppose that any onecycle applied to the whole human race. On the contrary, while man in one portionof the planet was in a condition of retrogression, in another he might beprogressing in enlightenment and civilization. How analogous this theory is to the law of planetary motion, which causes theindividual orbs to rotate on their axes; the several systems to move aroundtheir respective suns; and the whole stellar host to follow a common path arounda common centre! Life and death, light and darkness, day and night on theplanet, as it turns about its axis and traverses the zodiacal circlerepresenting the lesser and the greater cycles. * Remember the Hermeticaxiom:--\"As above, so below; as in heaven, so on earth.\" Mr. Alfred R. Wallace argues with sound logic, that the development of man hasbeen more marked in his mental organization than in his external form. Man, heconceives to differ from the animal, by being able to undergo great changes ofconditions and of his entire environment, without very marked alterations inbodily form and structure. The changes of climate he meets with a correspondingalteration in his clothing, shelter, weapons, and implements of husbandry. Hisbody may become less hairy, more erect, and of a different color andproportions; \"the head and face is immediately connected with the organ of themind, and as being the medium, expressing the most refined motions of hisnature,\" alone change with the development of his intellect. There was a timewhen \"he had not yet acquired that wonderfully-developed brain, the organ of themind, which now, even in his lowest examples, raises him far above the highestbrutes, at a period when he had the form, but hardly the nature of man, when heneither possessed human speech nor sympathetic and moral feelings.\" Further, Mr.Wallace says that \"Man may have been--indeed, I believe must have been, once ahomogeneous race . . . in man, the hairy covering of the body has almostentirely disappeared.\" Of the cave men of Les Eyzies, Mr. Wallace remarksfurther \" . . . the great breadth of the face, the enormous development of theascending ramus of the lower jaw . . . indicate enormous muscular power and thehabits of a savage and brutal race.\" Such are the glimpses which anthropology affords us of men, either arrived atthe bottom of a cycle or starting in a new one. Let us see how far they arecorroborated by clairvoyant psychometry. Professor Denton submitted a fragmentof fossilized bone to his wife's examination, without giving Mrs. Denton anyhint as to what the article was. It immediately called up to her pictures ofpeople and scenes which he thinks belonged to the stone age. She saw men closelyresembling monkeys, with a body very hairy, and \"as if the natural hair answeredthe purpose of clothing.\" \"I question whether he can stand perfectly upright;his hip-joints appear to be so formed, he cannot,\" she added. \"Occasionally Isee part of the body of one of those beings that looks comparatively smooth. Ican see the skin, which is lighter colored . . . I do not know whether hebelongs to the same period. . . . At a distance the face seems flat; the lowerpart of it is heavy; they have what I suppose would be called prognathous jaws.The frontal region of the head is low, and the lower portion of it is veryprominent, forming a round ridge across the forehead, immediately above theeyebrows. . . . Now I see a face that looks like that of a human being, thoughthere is a monkey-like appearance about it. All these seem of that kind, havinglong arms and hairy bodies.\" * Whether or not the men of science are willing to concede the correctness of theHermetic theory of the physical evolution of man from higher and more spiritualnatures, they themselves show us how the race has progressed from the lowestobserved point to its present development. And, as all nature seems to be madeup of analogies, is it unreasonable to affirm that the same progressivedevelopment of individual forms has prevailed among the inhabitants of theunseen universe? If such marvellous effects have been caused by evolution uponour little insignificant planet, producing reasoning and intuitive men from somehigher type of the ape family, why suppose that the boundless realms of spaceare inhabited only by disembodied angelic forms? Why not give place in that vastdomain to the spiritual duplicates of these hairy, long-armed and half-reasoningancestors, their predecessors, and all their successors, down to our time? Ofcourse, the spiritual parts of such primeval members of the human family wouldbe as uncouth and undeveloped as were their physical bodies. While they made noattempt to calculate the duration of the \"grand cycle,\" the Hermeticphilosophers yet maintained that, according to the cyclic law, the living humanrace must inevitably and collectively return one day to that point of departure,where man was first clothed with \"coats of skin\"; or, to express it moreclearly, the human race must, in accordance with the law of evolution, befinally physically spiritualized. Unless Messrs. Darwin and Huxley are preparedto prove that the man of our century has attained, as a physical and moralanimal, the acme of perfection, and evolution, having reached its apex, muststop all further progress with the modern genus Homo, we do not see how they canpossibly confute such a logical deduction. In his lecture on The Action of Natural Selection on Man, Mr. Alfred R. Wallaceconcludes his demonstrations as to the development of human races under that lawof selection by saying that, if his conclusions are just, \"it must inevitablyfollow that the higher--the more intellectual and moral--must displace the lowerand more degraded races; and the power of 'natural selection,' still acting onhis mental organization, must ever lead to the more perfect adaptation of man'shigher faculties to the condition of surrounding nature, and to the exigenciesof the social state. While his external form will probably ever remainunchanged, except in the development of that perfect beauty . . . refined andennobled by the highest intellectual faculties and sympathetic emotions, hismental constitution may continue to advance and improve, till the world is againinhabited by a single, nearly homogeneous race, no individual of which will beinferior to the noblest specimens of existing humanity.\" Sober, scientificmethods and cautiousness in hypothetical possibilities have evidently theirshare in this expression of the opinions of the great anthropologist. Still,what he says above clashes in no way with our kabalistic assertions. Allow toever-progressing nature, to the great law of the \"survival of the fittest,\" onestep beyond Mr. Wallace's deductions, and we have in future thepossibility--nay, the assurance of a race, which, like the Vril-ya ofBulwer-Lytton's Coming Race, will be but one remove from the primitive \"Sons ofGod.\" It will be observed that this philosophy of cycles, which was allegorized by theEgyptian Hierophants in the \"circle of necessity,\" explains at the same time theallegory of the \"Fall of man.\" According to the Arabian descriptions, each ofthe seven chambers of the Pyramids--those grandest of all cosmic symbols--wasknown by the name of a planet. The peculiar architecture of the Pyramids showsin itself the drift of the metaphysical thought of their builders. The apex islost in the clear blue sky of the land of the Pharaohs, and typifies theprimordial point lost in the unseen universe from whence started the first raceof the spiritual prototypes of man. Each mummy, from the moment that it wasembalmed, lost its physical individuality in one sense; it symbolized the humanrace. Placed in such a way as was best calculated to aid the exit of the \"soul,\"the latter had to pass through the seven planetary chambers before it made itsexit through the symbolical apex. Each chamber typified, at the same time, oneof the seven spheres, and one of the seven higher types of physico-spiritualhumanity alleged to be above our own. Every 3,000 years, the soul,representative of its race, had to return to its primal point of departurebefore it underwent another evolution into a more perfected spiritual andphysical transformation. We must go deep indeed into the abstruse metaphysics ofOriental mysticism before we can realize fully the infinitude of the subjectsthat were embraced at one sweep by the majestic thought of its exponents. Starting as a pure and perfect spiritual being, the Adam of the second chapterof Genesis, not satisfied with the position allotted to him by the Demiurgus(who is the eldest first-begotten, the Adam-Kadmon), Adam the second, the \"manof dust,\" strives in his pride to become Creator in his turn. Evolved out of theandrogynous Kadmon, this Adam is himself an androgyn; for, according to theoldest beliefs presented allegorically in Plato's Timaeus, the prototypes of ourraces were all enclosed in the microcosmic tree which grew and developed withinand under the great mundane or macrocosmic tree. Divine spirit being considereda unity, however numerous the rays of the great spiritual sun, man has still hadhis origin like all other forms, whether organic or otherwise, in this one Fountof Eternal Light. Were we even to reject the hypothesis of an androgynous man,in connection with physical evolution, the significance of the allegory in itsspiritual sense, would remain unimpaired. So long as the first god-man,symbolizing the two first principles of creation, the dual male and femaleelement, had no thought of good and evil he could not hypostasize \"woman,\" forshe was in him as he was in her. It was only when, as a result of the evil hintsof the serpent, matter, the latter condensed itself and cooled on the spiritualman in its contact with the elements, that the fruits of the man-tree--who ishimself that tree of knowledge--appeared to his view. From this moment theandrogynal union ceased, man evolved out of himself the woman as a separateentity. They have broken the thread between pure spirit and pure matter.Henceforth they will create no more spiritually, and by the sole power of theirwill; man has become a physical creator, and the kingdom of spirit can be wononly by a long imprisonment in matter. The meaning of Gogard, the Hellenic treeof life, the sacred oak among whose luxuriant branches a serpent dwells, andcannot be dislodged, * thus becomes apparent. Creeping out from the primordialilus, the mundane snake grows more material and waxes in strength and power withevery new evolution. The Adam Primus, or Kadmon, the Logos of the Jewish mystics, is the same as theGrecian Prometheus, who seeks to rival with the divine wisdom; he is also thePymander of Hermes, or the POWER OF THE THOUGHT DIVINE, in its most spiritualaspect, for he was less hypostasized by the Egyptians than the two former. Theseall create men, but fail in their final object. Desiring to endow man with animmortal spirit, in order that by linking the trinity in one, he might graduallyreturn to his primal spiritual state without losing his individuality,Prometheus fails in his attempt to steal the divine fire, and is sentenced toexpiate his crime on Mount Kazbeck. Prometheus is also the Logos of the ancientGreeks, as well as Herakles. In the Codex Nazaraeus ** we see Bahak-Zivodeserting the heaven of his father, confessing that though he is the father ofthe genii, he is unable to \"construct creatures,\" for he is equally unacquaintedwith Orcus as with \"the consuming fire which is wanting in light.\" And Fetahil,one of the \"powers,\" sits in the \"mud\" (matter) and wonders why the living fireis so changed. All of these Logoi strove to endow man with the immortal spirit, failed, andnearly all are represented as being punished for the attempt by severesentences. Those of the early Christian Fathers who like Origen and ClemensAlexandrinus, were well versed in Pagan symbology, having begun their careers asphilosophers, felt very much embarrassed. They could not deny the anticipationof their doctrines in the oldest myths. The latest Logos, according to theirteachings, had also appeared in order to show mankind the way to immortality;and in his desire to endow the world with eternal life through the Pentecostalfire, had lost his life agreeably to the traditional programme. Thus wasoriginated the very awkward explanation of which our modern clergy freely availthemselves, that all these mythic types show the prophetic spirit which, throughthe Lord's mercy, was afforded even to the heathen idolaters! The Pagans, theyassert, had presented in their imagery the great drama of Calvary --hence theresemblance. On the other hand, the philosophers maintained, with unassailablelogic, that the pious fathers had simply helped themselves to a ready-madegroundwork, either finding it easier than to exert their own imagination, orbecause of the greater number of ignorant proselytes who were attracted to thenew doctrine by such an extraordinary resemblance with their mythologies, atleast as far as the outward form of the most fundamental doctrines goes. The allegory of the Fall of man and the fire of Prometheus is also anotherversion of the myth of the rebellion of the proud Lucifer, hurled down to thebottomless pit--Orcus. In the religion of the Brahmans, Moisasure, the HinduLucifer, becomes envious of the Creator's resplendent light, and at the head ofa legion of inferior spirits rebels against Brahma, and declares war againsthim. Like Hercules, the faithful Titan, who helps Jupiter and restores to himhis throne, Siva, the third person of the Hindu trinity, hurls them all from thecelestial abode in Honderah, the region of eternal darkness. But here the fallenangels are made to repent of their evil deed, and in the Hindu doctrine they areall afforded the opportunity to progress. In the Greek fiction, Hercules, theSun-god, descends to Hades to deliver the victims from their tortures; and theChristian Church also makes her incarnate god descend to the dreary Plutonicregions and overcome the rebellious ex-archangel. In their turn the kabalistsexplain the allegory in a semi-scientific way. Adam the second, or thefirst-created race which Plato calls gods, and the Bible the Elohim, was nottriple in his nature like the earthly man: i.e., he was not composed of soul,spirit, and body, but was a compound of sublimated astral elements into whichthe \"Father\" had breathed an immortal, divine spirit. The latter, by reason ofits godlike essence, was ever struggling to liberate itself from the bonds ofeven that flimsy prison; hence the \"sons of God,\" in their imprudent efforts,were the first to trace a future model for the cyclic law. But, man must not be\"like one of us,\" says the Creative Deity, one of the Elohim \"intrusted with thefabrication of the lower animal.\" * And thus it was, when the men of the firstrace had reached the summit of the first cycle, they lost their balance, andtheir second envelope, the grosser clothing (astral body), dragged them down theopposite arc. This kabalistic version of the sons of God (or of light) is given in the CodexNazaraeus. Bahak-Zivo, the \"father of genii, is ordered to 'constructcreatures.' \" But, as he is \"ignorant of Orcus,\" he fails to do so and calls inFetahil a still purer spirit to his aid, who fails still worse. Then steps on the stage of creation the \"spirit\" ** (which properly ought to betranslated \"soul,\" for it is the anima mundi, and which with the Nazarenes andthe Gnostics was feminine), and perceiving that for Fetahil, * the newest man(the latest), the splendor was \"changed,\" and that for splendor existed\"decrease and damage,\" awakes Karabtanos, ** \"who was frantic and without senseand judgment,\" and says to him: \"Arise; see, the splendor (light) of the newestman (Fetahil) has failed (to produce or create men), the decrease of thissplendor is visible. Rise up, come with thy MOTHER (the spiritus) and free theefrom limits by which thou art held, and those more ample than the whole world.\"After which follows the union of the frantic and blind matter, guided by theinsinuations of the spirit (not the Divine breath, but the Astral spirit, whichby its double essence is already tainted with matter) and the offer of theMOTHER being accepted the Spiritus conceives \"Seven Figures,\" which Irenaeus isdisposed to take for the seven stellars (planets) but which represent the sevencapital sins, the progeny of an astral soul separated from its divine source(spirit) and matter, the blind demon of concupiscence. Seeing this, Fetahilextends his hand toward the abyss of matter, and says: \"Let the earth exist,just as the abode of the powers has existed.\" Dipping his hand in the chaos,which he condenses, he creates our planet. *** Then the Codex proceeds to tell how Bahak-Zivo was separated from the Spiritus,and the genii, or angels, from the rebels. **** Then Mano ***** (the greatest),who dwells with the greatest FERHO, calls Kebar-Zivo (known also by the name ofNebat-Iavar bar Iufin-Ifafin), Helm and Vine of the food of life ****** he beingthe third life, and, commiserating the rebellious and foolish genii, on accountof the magnitude of their ambition, says: \"Lord of the genii ******* (Æons), seewhat the genii, the rebellious angels do, and about what they areconsulting. ******** They say, \"Let us call forth the world, and let us call the'powers' into existence. The genii are the Principes, the 'sons of Light,' butthou art the 'Messenger of Life.' \" ********* And in order to counteract the influence of the seven \"badly disposed\"principles, the progeny of Spiritus, CABAR ZIO, the mighty Lord of Splendor,procreates seven other lives (the cardinal virtues) who shine in their own formand light \"from on high\" * and thus reestablishes the balance between good andevil, light and darkness. But this creation of beings, without the requisite influx of divine pure breathin them, which was known among the kabalists as the \"Living Fire,\" produced butcreatures of matter and astral light. ** Thus were generated the animals whichpreceded man on this earth. The spiritual beings, the \"sons of light,\" those whoremained faithful to the great Ferho (the First Cause of all), constitute thecelestial or angelic hierarchy, the Adonim, and the legions of thenever-embodied spiritual men. The followers of the rebellious and foolish genii,and the descendants of the \"witless\" seven spirits begotten by \"Karabtanos\" andthe \"spiritus,\" became, in course of time, the \"men of our planet,\" *** afterhaving previously passed through every \"creation\" of every one of the elements.From this stage of life they have been traced by Darwin, who shows us how ourhighest forms have been evolved out of the lowest. Anthropology dares not followthe kabalist in his metaphysical flights beyond this planet, and it is doubtfulif its teachers have the courage to search for the missing link in the oldkabalistic manuscripts. Thus was set in motion the first cycle, which in its rotations downward, broughtan infinitesimal part of the created lives to our planet of mud. Arrived at thelowest point of the arc of the cycle which directly preceded life on this earth,the pure divine spark still lingering in the Adam made an effort to separateitself from the astral spirit, for \"man was falling gradually into generation,\"and the fleshy coat was becoming with every action more and more dense. And now comes a mystery, a Sod; **** a secret which Rabbi Simeon * imparted butto very few initiates. It was enacted once every seven years during theMysteries of Samothrace, and the records of it are found self-printed on theleaves of the Thibetan sacred tree, the mysterious KOUNBOUM, in the Lamasery ofthe holy adepts. ** In the shoreless ocean of space radiates the central, spiritual, and Invisiblesun. The universe is his body, spirit and soul; and after this ideal model areframed ALL THINGS. These three emanations are the three lives, the three degreesof the gnostic Pleroma, the three \"Kabalistic Faces,\" for the ANCIENT of theancient, the holy of the aged, the great En-Soph, \"has a form and then he has noform.\" The invisible \"assumed a form when he called the universe intoexistence,\" *** says the Sohar, the Book of splendor. The first light is Hissoul, the Infinite, Boundless, and Immortal breath; under the efflux of whichthe universe heaves its mighty bosom, infusing Intelligent life throughoutcreation. The second emanation condenses cometary matter and produces formswithin the cosmic circle; sets the countless worlds floating in the electricspace, and infuses the unintelligent, blind life-principle into every form. Thethird, produces the whole universe of physical matter; and as it keeps graduallyreceding from the Central Divine Light its brightness wanes and it becomesDARKNESS and the BAD--pure matter, the \"gross purgations of the celestial fire\"of the Hermetists. When the Central Invisible (the Lord Ferho) saw the efforts of the divineScintilla, unwilling to be dragged lower down into the degradation of matter, toliberate itself, he permitted it to shoot out from itself a monad, over which,attached to it as by the finest thread, the Divine Scintilla (the soul) had towatch during its ceaseless peregrinations from one form to another. Thus themonad was shot down into the first form of matter and became encased in stone;then, in course of time, through the combined efforts of living fire and livingwater, both of which shone their reflection upon the stone, the monad crept outof its prison to sunlight as a lichen. From change to change it went higher andhigher; the monad, with every new transformation borrowing more of the radianceof its parent, Scintilla, which approached it nearer at every transmigration.For \"the First Cause, had willed it to proceed in this order\" and destined it tocreep on higher until its physical form became once more the Adam of dust,shaped in the image of the Adam Kadmon. Before undergoing its last earthlytransformation, the external covering of the monad, from the moment of itsconception as an embryo, passes in turn, once more, through the phases of theseveral kingdoms. In its fluidic prison it assumes a vague resemblance atvarious periods of the gestation to plant, reptile, bird, and animal, until itbecomes a human embryo. * At the birth of the future man, the monad, radiatingwith all the glory of its immortal parent which watches it from the seventhsphere, becomes senseless. ** It loses all recollection of the past, and returnsto consciousness but gradually, when the instinct of childhood gives way toreason and intelligence. After the separation between the life-principle (astralspirit) and the body takes place, the liberated soul--Monad, exultingly rejoinsthe mother and father spirit, the radiant Augoeides, and the two, merged intoone, forever form, with a glory proportioned to the spiritual purity of the pastearth-life, the Adam who has completed the circle of necessity, and is freedfrom the last vestige of his physical encasement. Henceforth, growing more andmore radiant at each step of his upward progress, he mounts the shining paththat ends at the point from which he started around the GRAND CYCLE. The whole Darwinian theory of natural selection is included in the first sixchapters of the Book of Genesis. The \"Man\" of chapter i. is radically differentfrom the \"Adam\" of chapter ii., for the former was created \"male andfemale\"--that is, bi-sexed--and in the image of God; while the latter, accordingto verse seven, was formed of the dust of the ground, and became \"a livingsoul,\" after the Lord God \"breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.\"Moreover, this Adam was a male being, and in verse twenty we are told that\"there was not found a helpmeet for him.\" The Adonai, being pure spiritualentities, had no sex, or rather had both sexes united in themselves, like theirCreator; and the ancients understood this so well that they represented many oftheir deities as of dual sex. The Biblical student must either accept thisinterpretation, or make the passages in the two chapters alluded to absurdlycontradict each other. It was such literal acceptance of passages that warrantedthe atheists in covering the Mosaic account with ridicule, and it is the deadletter of the old text that begets the materialism of our age. Not only arethese two races of beings thus clearly indicated in Genesis, but even a thirdand a fourth one are ushered before the reader in chapter iv., where the \"sonsof God\" and the race of \"giants\" are spoken of. As we write, there appears in an American paper, The Kansas City Times, anaccount of important discoveries of the remains of a prehistorical race ofgiants, which corroborates the statements of the kabalists and the Bibleallegories at the same time. It is worth preserving: \"In his researches among the forests of Western Missouri, Judge E. P. West hasdiscovered a number of conical-shaped mounds, similar in construction to thosefound in Ohio and Kentucky. These mounds are found upon the high bluffsoverlooking the Missouri River, the largest and more prominent being found inTennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Until about three weeks ago it was notsuspected that the mound builders had made this region their home in theprehistoric days; but now it is discovered that this strange and extinct raceonce occupied this land, and have left an extensive graveyard in a number ofhigh mounds upon the Clay County bluffs. \"As yet, only one of these mounds has been opened. Judge West discovered askeleton about two weeks ago, and made a report to other members of the society.They accompanied him to the mound, and not far from the surface excavated andtook out the remains of two skeletons. The bones are very large--so large, infact, when compared with an ordinary skeleton of modern date, they appear tohave formed part of a giant. The head bones, such as have not rotted away, aremonstrous in size. The lower jaw of one skeleton is in a state of preservation,and is double the size of the jaw of a civilized person. The teeth in thisjawbone are large, and appear to have been ground down and worn away by contactwith roots and carnivorous food. The jaw-bone indicates immense muscularstrength. The thigh-bone, when compared with that of an ordinary modernskeleton, looks like that of a horse. The length, thickness, and musculardevelopment are remarkable. But the most peculiar part about the skeleton is thefrontal bone. It is very low, and differs radically from any ever seen in thissection before. It forms one thick ridge of bone about one inch wide, extendingacross the eyes. It is a narrow but rather heavy ridge of bone which, instead ofextending upward, as it does now in these days of civilization, receded backfrom the eyebrows, forming a flat head, and thus indicates a very low order ofmankind. It is the opinion of the scientific gentlemen who are making thesediscoveries that these bones are the remains of a prehistoric race of men. Theydo not resemble the present existing race of Indians, nor are the moundsconstructed upon any pattern or model known to have been in use by any race ofmen now in existence in America. The bodies are discovered in a sitting posturein the mounds, and among the bones are found stone weapons, such as flintknives, flint scrapers, and all of them different in shape to the arrow-heads,war-hatchets, and other stone tools and weapons known to have been in use by theaboriginal Indians of this land when discovered by the whites. The gentlemen whohave these curious bones in charge have deposited them with Dr. Foe, on Mainstreet. It is their intention to make further and closer researches in themounds on the bluffs opposite this city. They will make a report of their laborsat the next meeting of the Academy of Science, by which time they expect to beable to make some definite report as to their opinions. It is pretty definitelysettled, however, that the skeletons are those of a race of men not now inexistence.\" The author of a recent and very elaborate work * finds some cause for merrimentover the union of the sons of God with the \"daughters of men,\" who were fair, asalluded to in Genesis, and described at great length in that wonderful legend,the Book of Enoch. More is the pity, that our most learned and liberal men donot employ their close and merciless logic to repair its one-sidedness byseeking the true spirit which dictated these allegories of old. This spirit wascertainly more scientific than skeptics are yet prepared to admit. But withevery year some new discovery may corroborate their assertions, until the wholeof antiquity is vindicated. One thing, at least, has been shown in the Hebrew text, viz.: that there was onerace of purely physical creatures, another purely spiritual. The evolution and\"transformation of species\" required to fill the gap between the two has beenleft to abler anthropologists. We can only repeat the philosophy of men of old,which says that the union of these two races produced a third--the Adamite race.Sharing the natures of both its parents, it is equally adapted to an existencein the material and spiritual worlds. Allied to the physical half of man'snature is reason, which enables him to maintain his supremacy over the loweranimals, and to subjugate nature to his uses. Allied to his spiritual part ishis conscience, which will serve as his unerring guide through the besetments ofthe senses; for conscience is that instantaneous perception between right andwrong, which can only be exercised by the spirit, which, being a portion of theDivine Wisdom and Purity, is absolutely pure and wise. Its promptings areindependent of reason, and it can only manifest itself clearly, when unhamperedby the baser attractions of our dual nature. Reason being a faculty of our physical brain, one which is justly defined asthat of deducing inferences from premises, and being wholly dependent on theevidence of other senses, cannot be a quality pertaining directly to our divinespirit. The latter knows--hence, all reasoning which implies discussion andargument would be useless. So an entity, which, if it must be considered as adirect emanation from the eternal Spirit of wisdom, has to be viewed aspossessed of the same attributes as the essence or the whole of which it is apart. Therefore, it is with a certain degree of logic that the ancienttheurgists maintained that the rational part of man's soul (spirit) neverentered wholly into the man's body, but only overshadowed him more or lessthrough the irrational or astral soul, which serves as an intermediatory agent,or a medium between spirit and body. The man who has conquered mattersufficiently to receive the direct light from his shining Augoeides, feels truthintuitionally; he could not err in his judgment, notwithstanding all thesophisms suggested by cold reason, for he is ILLUMINATED. Hence, prophecy,vaticination, and the so-called Divine inspiration are simply the effects ofthis illumination from above by our own immortal spirit. Swedenborg, following the mystical doctrines of the Hermetic philosophers,devoted a number of volumes to the elucidation of the \"internal sense\" ofGenesis. Swedenborg was undoubtedly a \"natural-born magician,\" a seer; he wasnot an adept. Thus, however closely he may have followed the apparent method ofinterpretation used by the alchemists and mystic writers, he partially failed;the more so, that the model chosen by him in this method was one who, albeit agreat alchemist, was no more of an adept than the Swedish seer himself, in thefullest sense of the word. Eugenius Philalethes had never attained \"the highestpyrotechny,\" to use the diction of the mystic philosophers. But, although bothhave missed the whole truth in its details, Swedenborg has virtually given thesame interpretation of the first chapter of Genesis as the Hermeticphilosophers. The seer, as well as the initiates, notwithstanding their veiledphraseology, clearly show that the first chapters of Genesis relate to theregeneration, or a new birth of man, not to the creation of our universe and itscrown work--MAN. The fact that the terms of the alchemists, such as salt,sulphur, and mercury are transformed by Swedenborg into ens, cause, andeffect, * does not affect the underlying idea of solving the problems of theMosaic books by the only possible method--that used by the Hermetists--that ofcorrespondences. His doctrine of correspondence, or Hermetic symbolism, is that of Pythagoras andof the kabalists--\"as above, so below.\" It is also that of the Buddhistphilosophers, who, in their still more abstract metaphysics, inverting the usualmode of definition given by our erudite scholars, call the invisible types theonly reality, and everything else the effects of the causes, or visibleprototypes--illusions. However contradictory their various elucidations of thePentateuch may appear on their surface, every one of them tends to show that thesacred literature of every country, the Bible as much as the Vedas or theBuddhist Scriptures, can only be understood and thoroughly sifted by the lightof Hermetic philosophy. The great sages of antiquity, those of the mediaevalages, and the mystical writers of our more modern times also, were allHermetists. Whether the light of truth had illuminated them through theirfaculty of intuition, or as a consequence of study and regular initiation,virtually, they had accepted the method and followed the path traced to them bysuch men as Moses, Gautama-Buddha, and Jesus. The truth, symbolized by somealchemists as dew from heaven, had descended into their hearts, and they had allgathered it upon the tops of mountains, after having spread CLEAN linen clothsto receive it; and thus, in one sense, they had secured, each for himself, andin his own way, the universal solvent. How much they were allowed to share itwith the public is another question. That veil, which is alleged to have coveredthe face of Moses, when, after descending from Sinai, he taught his people theWord of God, cannot be withdrawn at the will of the teacher only. It depends onthe listeners, whether they will also remove the veil which is \"upon theirhearts.\" Paul says it plainly; and his words addressed to the Corinthians can beapplied to every man or woman, and of any age in the history of the world. If\"their minds are blinded\" by the shining skin of divine truth, whether theHermetic veil be withdrawn or not from the face of the teacher, it cannot betaken away from their heart unless \"it shall turn to the Lord.\" But the latterappellation must not be applied to either of the three anthropomorphizedpersonages of the Trinity, but to the \"Lord,\" as understood by Swedenborg andthe Hermetic philosophers--the Lord, who is Life and MAN. The everlasting conflict between the world-religions--Christianity, Judaism,Brahmanism, Paganism, Buddhism, proceeds from this one source: Truth is knownbut to the few; the rest, unwilling to withdraw the veil from their own hearts,imagine it blinding the eyes of their neighbor. The god of every exotericreligion, including Christianity, not withstanding its pretensions to mystery,is an idol, a fiction, and cannot be anything else. Moses, closely-veiled,speaks to the stiff-necked multitudes of Jehovah, the cruel, anthropomorphicdeity, as of the highest God, burying deep in the bottom of his heart that truthwhich cannot be \"either spoken of or revealed.\" Kapila cuts with the sharp swordof his sarcasms the Brahman-Yoggins, who in their mystical visions pretend tosee the HIGHEST one. Gautama-Buddha conceals, under an impenetrable cloak ofmetaphysical subtilties, the verity, and is regarded by posterity as an atheist.Pythagoras, with his allegorical mysticism and metempsychosis, is held for aclever impostor, and is succeeded in the same estimation by other philosophers,like Apollonius and Plotinus, who are generally spoken of as visionaries, if notcharlatans. Plato, whose writings were never read by the majority of our greatscholars but superficially, is accused by many of his translators of absurditiesand puerilities, and even of being ignorant of his own language; * most likelyfor saying, in reference to the Supreme, that \"a matter of that kind cannot beexpressed by words, like other things to be learned\"; ** and making Protagoraslay too much stress on the use of \"veils.\" We could fill a whole volume withnames of misunderstood sages, whose writings--only because our materialisticcritics feel unable to lift the \"veil,\" which shrouds them--pass off in acurrent way for mystical absurdities. The most important feature of thisseemingly incomprehensible mystery lies perhaps in the inveterate habit of themajority of readers to judge a work by its words and insufficiently-expressedideas, leaving the spirit of it out of the question. Philosophers of quitedifferent schools may be often found to use a multitude of differentexpressions, some dark and metaphorical--all figurative, and yet treating of thesame subject. Like the thousand divergent rays of a globe of fire, every rayleads, nevertheless, to the central point, so every mystic philosopher, whetherhe be a devotedly pious enthusiast like Henry More; an irascible alchemist,using a Billingsgate phraseology--like his adversary, Eugenius Philalethes; oran atheist (?) like Spinoza, all had one and the same object in view--MAN. It isSpinoza, however, who furnishes perhaps the truest key to a portion of thisunwritten secret. While Moses forbids \"graven images\" of Him whose name is notto be taken in vain, Spinoza goes farther. He clearly infers that God must notbe so much as described. Human language is totally unfit to give an idea of this\"Being\" who is altogether unique. Whether it is Spinoza or the Christiantheology that is more right in their premises and conclusion, we leave thereader to judge for himself. Every attempt to the contrary leads a nation toanthropomorphize the deity in whom it believes, and the result is that given bySwedenborg. Instead of stating that God made man after his own image, we oughtin truth to say that \"man imagines God after his image,\" *** forgetting that hehas set up his own reflection for worship. Where, then, lies the true, real secret so much talked about by the Hermetists?That there was and there is a secret, no candid student of esoteric literaturewill ever doubt. Men of genius--as many of the Hermetic philosophers undeniablywere--would not have made fools of themselves by trying to fool others forseveral thousand consecutive years. That this great secret, commonly termed \"thephilosopher's stone,\" had a spiritual as well as a physical meaning attached toit, was suspected in all ages. The author of Remarks on Alchemy and theAlchemists very truly observes that the subject of the Hermetic art is MAN, andthe object of the art is the perfection of man. * But we cannot agree with himthat only those whom he terms \"money-loving sots,\" ever attempted to carry apurely moral design (of the alchemists) into the field of physical science. Thefact alone that man, in their eyes, is a trinity, which they divide into Sol,water of mercury, and sulphur, which is the secret fire, or, to speak plain,into body, soul, and spirit, shows that there is a physical side to thequestion. Man is the philosopher's stone spiritually--\"a triune or trinity inunity,\" as Philalethes expresses it. But he is also that stone physically. Thelatter is but the effect of the cause, and the cause is the universal solvent ofeverything--divine spirit. Man is a correlation of chemical physical forces, aswell as a correlation of spiritual powers. The latter react on the physicalpowers of man in proportion to the development of the earthly man. \"The work iscarried to perfection according to the virtue of a body, soul, and spirit,\" saysan alchemist; \"for the body would never be penetrable were it not for thespirit, nor would the spirit be permanent in its supra-perfect tincture, were itnot for the body; nor could these two act one upon another without the soul, forthe spirit is an invisible thing, nor doth it ever appear without anotherGARMENT, which garment is the SOUL.\" ** The \"philosophers by fire\" asserted, through their chief, Robert Fludd, thatsympathy is the offspring of light, and \"antipathy hath its beginning fromdarkness.\" Moreover, they taught, with other kabalists, that \"contrarieties innature doth proceed from one eternal essence, or from the root of all things.\"Thus, the first cause is the parent-source of good as well as of evil. Thecreator--who is not the Highest God--is the father of matter, which is bad, aswell as of spirit, which, emanating from the highest, invisible cause, passesthrough him like through a vehicle, and pervades the whole universe. \"It is mostcertain,\" remarks Robertus di Fluctibus (Robert Fludd), \"that, as there are aninfinity of visible creatures, so there is an endless variety of invisible ones,of divers natures, in the universal machine. Through the mysterious name of God,which Moses was so desirous of him (Jehova) to hear and know, when he receivedfrom him this answer, Jehova is my everlasting name. As for the other name, itis so pure and simple that it cannot be articulated, or compounded, or trulyexpressed by man's voice . . . all the other names are wholly comprehendedwithin it, for it contains the property as well of Nolunty as volunty, ofprivation as position, of death as life, of cursing as blessing, of evil as good(though nothing ideally is bad in him), of hatred and discord, and consequentlyof sympathy and antipathy.\" * Lowest in the scale of being are those invisible creatures called by thekabalists the \"elementary.\" There are three distinct classes of these. Thehighest, in intelligence and cunning, are the so-called terrestrial spirits, ofwhich we will speak more categorically in other parts of this work. Suffice tosay, for the present, that they are the larvae, or shadows of those who havelived on earth, have refused all spiritual light, remained and died deeplyimmersed in the mire of matter, and from whose sinful souls the immortal spirithas gradually separated. The second class is composed of the invisible antitypesof the men to be born. No form can come into objective existence--from thehighest to the lowest--before the abstract ideal of this form--or, as Aristotlewould call it, the privation of this form--is called forth. Before an artistpaints a picture every feature of it exists already in his imagination; to haveenabled us to discern a watch, this particular watch must have existed in itsabstract form in the watchmaker's mind. So with future men. According to Aristotle's doctrine, there are three principles of natural bodies:privation, matter, and form. These principles may be applied in this particularcase. The privation of the child which is to be we will locate in the invisiblemind of the great Architect of the Universe--privation not being considered inthe Aristotelic philosophy as a principle in the composition of bodies, but asan external property in their production; for the production is a change bywhich the matter passes from the shape it has not to that which it assumes.Though the privation of the unborn child's form, as well as of the future formof the unmade watch, is that which is neither substance nor extension norquality as yet, nor any kind of existence, it is still something which is,though its outlines, in order to be, must acquire an objective form--theabstract must become concrete, in short. Thus, as soon as this privation ofmatter is transmitted by energy to universal ether, it becomes a material form,however sublimated. If modern science teaches that human thought \"affects thematter of another universe simultaneously with this,\" how can he who believes inan Intelligent First Cause, deny that the divine thought is equally transmitted,by the same law of energy, to our common mediator, the universal ether--theworld-soul? And, if so, then it must follow that once there the divine thoughtmanifests itself objectively, energy faithfully reproducing the outlines of thatwhose \"privation\" was first born in the divine mind. Only it must not beunderstood that this thought creates matter. No; it creates but the design forthe future form; the matter which serves to make this design having always beenin existence, and having been prepared to form a human body, through a series ofprogressive transformations, as the result of evolution. Forms pass; ideas thatcreated them and the material which gave them objectiveness, remain. Thesemodels, as yet devoid of immortal spirits, are \"elementals,\"--properly speaking,psychic embryos--which, when their time arrives, die out of the invisible world,and are born into this visible one as human infants, receiving in transitu thatdivine breath called spirit which completes the perfect man. This class cannotcommunicate objectively with men. The third class are the \"elementals\" proper, which never evolve into humanbeings, but occupy, as it were, a specific step of the ladder of being, and, bycomparison with the others, may properly be called nature-spirits, or cosmicagents of nature, each being confined to its own element and never transgressingthe bounds of others. These are what Tertullian called the \"princes of thepowers of the air.\" This class is believed to possess but one of the three attributes of man. Theyhave neither immortal spirits nor tangible bodies; only astral forms, whichpartake, in a distinguishing degree, of the element to which they belong andalso of the ether. They are a combination of sublimated matter and a rudimentalmind. Some are changeless, but still have no separate individuality, actingcollectively, so to say. Others, of certain elements and species, change formunder a fixed law which kabalists explain. The most solid of their bodies isordinarily just immaterial enough to escape perception by our physical eyesight,but not so unsubstantial but that they can be perfectly recognized by the inner,or clairvoyant vision. They not only exist and can all live in ether, but canhandle and direct it for the production of physical effects, as readily as wecan compress air or water for the same purpose by pneumatic and hydraulicapparatus; in which occupation they are readily helped by the \"humanelementary.\" More than this; they can so condense it as to make to themselvestangible bodies, which by their Protean powers they can cause to assume suchlikeness as they choose, by taking as their models the portraits they findstamped in the memory of the persons present. It is not necessary that thesitter should be thinking at the moment of the one represented. His image mayhave faded many years before. The mind receives indelible impression even fromchance acquaintance or persons encountered but once. As a few seconds exposureof the sensitized photograph plate is all that is requisite to preserveindefinitely the image of the sitter, so is it with the mind. According to the doctrine of Proclus, the uppermost regions from the zenith ofthe universe to the moon belonged to the gods or planetary spirits, according totheir hierarchies and classes. The highest among them were the twelveuper-ouranioi, or supercelestial gods, having whole legions of subordinatedemons at their command. They are followed next in rank and power by theegkosmioi, the intercosmic gods, each of these presiding over a great number ofdemons, to whom they impart their power and change it from one to another atwill. These are evidently the personified forces of nature in their mutualcorrelation, the latter being represented by the third class or the \"elementals\"we have just described. Further on he shows, on the principle of the Hermetic axiom--of types, andprototypes--that the lower spheres have their subdivisions and classes of beingsas well as the upper celestial ones, the former being always subordinate to thehigher ones. He held that the four elements are all filled with demons,maintaining with Aristotle that the universe is full, and that there is no voidin nature. The demons of the earth, air, fire, and water are of an elastic,ethereal, semi-corporeal essence. It is these classes which officiate asintermediate agents between the gods and men. Although lower in intelligencethan the sixth order of the higher demons, these beings preside directly overthe elements and organic life. They direct the growth, the inflorescence, theproperties, and various changes of plants. They are the personified ideas orvirtues shed from the heavenly ule into the inorganic matter; and, as thevegetable kingdom is one remove higher than the mineral, these emanations fromthe celestial gods take form and being in the plant, they become its soul. It isthat which Aristotle's doctrine terms the form in the three principles ofnatural bodies, classified by him as privation, matter, and form. His philosophyteaches that besides the original matter, another principle is necessary tocomplete the triune nature of every particle, and this is form; an invisible,but still, in an ontological sense of the word, a substantial being, reallydistinct from matter proper. Thus, in an animal or a plant, besides the bones,the flesh, the nerves, the brains, and the blood, in the former, and besides thepulpy matter, tissues, fibres, and juice in the latter, which blood and juice,by circulating through the veins and fibres, nourishes all parts of both animaland plant; and besides the animal spirits, which are the principles of motion;and the chemical energy which is transformed into vital force in the green leaf,there must be a substantial form, which Aristotle called in the horse, thehorse's soul; Proclus, the demon of every mineral, plant, or animal, and themediaeval philosophers, the elementary spirits of the four kingdoms. All this is held in our century as metaphysics and gross superstition. Still, onstrictly ontological principles, there is, in these old hypotheses, some shadowof probability, some clew to the perplexing \"missing links\" of exact science.The latter has become so dogmatical of late, that all that lies beyond the kenof inductive science is termed imaginary; and we find Professor Joseph Le Contestating that some of the best scientists \"ridicule the use of the term 'vitalforce,' or vitality, as a remnant of superstition.\" * De Candolle suggests theterm \"vital movement,\" instead of vital force; ** thus preparing for a finalscientific leap which will transform the immortal, thinking man, into anautomaton with a clock-work inside him. \"But,\" objects Le Conte, \"can weconceive of movement without force? And if the movement is peculiar, so also isthe form of force.\" In the Jewish Kabala, the nature-spirits were known under the general name ofShedim and divided into four classes. The Persians called them all devs; theGreeks, indistinctly designated them as demons; the Egyptians knew them asafrites. The ancient Mexicans, says Kaiser, believed in numerous spirit-abodes,into one of which the shades of innocent children were placed until finaldisposal; into another, situated in the sun, ascended the valiant souls ofheroes; while the hideous spectres of incorrigible sinners were sentenced towander and despair in subterranean caves, held in the bonds of theearth-atmosphere, unwilling and unable to liberate themselves. They passed theirtime in communicating with mortals, and frightening those who could see them.Some of the African tribes know them as Yowahoos. In the Indian Pantheon thereare no less than 330,000,000 of various kinds of spirits, including elementals,which latter were termed by the Brahmans the Daityas. These beings are known bythe adepts to be attracted toward certain quarters of the heavens by somethingof the same mysterious property which makes the magnetic needle turn toward thenorth, and certain plants to obey the same attraction. The various races arealso believed to have a special sympathy with certain human temperaments, and tomore readily exert power over such than others. Thus, a bilious, lymphatic,nervous, or sanguine person would be affected favorably or otherwise byconditions of the astral light, resulting from the different aspects of theplanetary bodies. Having reached this general principle, after recordedobservations extending over an indefinite series of years, or ages, the adeptastrologer would require only to know what the planetary aspects were at a givenanterior date, and to apply his knowledge of the succeeding changes in theheavenly bodies, to be able to trace, with approximate accuracy, the varyingfortunes of the personage whose horoscope was required, and even to predict thefuture. The accuracy of the horoscope would depend, of course, no less upon theastrologer's knowledge of the occult forces and races of nature, than upon hisastronomical erudition. Eliphas Levi expounds with reasonable clearness, in his Dogme et Rituel de laHaute Magie, the law of reciprocal influences between the planets and theircombined effect upon the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, as well asupon ourselves. He states that the astral atmosphere is as constantly changingfrom day to day, and from hour to hour, as the air we breathe. He quotesapprovingly the doctrine of Paracelsus that every man, animal, and plant bearsexternal and internal evidences of the influences dominant at the moment ofgerminal development. He repeats the old kabalistic doctrine, that nothing isunimportant in nature, and that even so small a thing as the birth of one childupon our insignificant planet has its effect upon the universe, as the wholeuniverse has its own reactive influence upon him. \"The stars,\" he remarks, \"are linked to each other by attractions which holdthem in equilibrium and cause them to move with regularity through space. Thisnetwork of light stretches from all the spheres to all the spheres, and there isnot a point upon any planet to which is not attached one of these indestructiblethreads. The precise locality, as well as the hour of birth, should then becalculated by the true adept in astrology; then, when he shall have made theexact calculation of the astral influences, it remains for him to count thechances of his position in life, the helps or hindrances he is likely toencounter . . . and his natural impulses toward the accomplishment of hisdestiny.\" He also asserts that the individual force of the person, as indicatinghis ability to conquer difficulties and subdue unfavorable propensities, and socarve out his fortune, or to passively await what blind fate may bring, must betaken into account. A consideration of the subject from the standpoint of the ancients, affords us,it will be seen, a very different view from that taken by Professor Tyndall inhis famous Belfast address. \"To supersensual beings,\" says he, \"which, howeverpotent and invisible, were nothing but species of human creatures, perhapsraised from among mankind, and retaining all human passions and appetites, werehanded over the rule and governance of natural phenomena.\" To enforce his point, Mr. Tyndall conveniently quotes from Euripides thefamiliar passage in Hume: \"The gods toss all into confusion, mix everything withits reverse, that all of us, from our ignorance and uncertainty, may pay themthe more worship and reverence.\" Although enunciating in Chrysippus severalPythagorean doctrines, Euripides is considered by every ancient writer asheterodox, therefore the quotation proceeding from this philosopher does not atall strengthen Mr. Tyndall's argument. As to the human spirit, the notions of the older philosophers and medievalkabalists while differing in some particulars, agreed on the whole; so that thedoctrine of one may be viewed as the doctrine of the other. The most substantialdifference consisted in the location of the immortal or divine spirit of man.While the ancient Neo-platonists held that the Augoeides never descendshypostatically into the living man, but only sheds more or less its radiance onthe inner man--the astral soul--the kabalists of the middle ages maintained thatthe spirit, detaching itself from the ocean of light and spirit, entered intoman's soul, where it remained through life imprisoned in the astral capsule.This difference was the result of the belief of Christian kabalists, more orless, in the dead letter of the allegory of the fall of man. The soul, theysaid, became, through the fall of Adam, contaminated with the world of matter,or Satan. Before it could appear with its enclosed divine spirit in the presenceof the Eternal, it had to purify itself of the impurities of darkness. Theycompared \"the spirit imprisoned within the soul to a drop of water enclosedwithin a capsule of gelatine and thrown in the ocean; so long as the capsuleremains whole the drop of water remains isolated; break the envelope and thedrop becomes a part of the ocean--its individual existence has ceased. So it iswith the spirit. As long as it is enclosed in its plastic mediator, or soul, ithas an individual existence. Destroy the capsule, a result which may occur fromthe agonies of withered conscience, crime, and moral disease, and the spiritreturns back to its original abode. Its individuality is gone.\" On the other hand, the philosophers who explained the \"fall into generation\" intheir own way, viewed spirit as something wholly distinct from the soul. Theyallowed its presence in the astral capsule only so far as the spiritualemanations or rays of the \"shining one\" were concerned. Man and soul had toconquer their immortality by ascending toward the unity with which, ifsuccessful, they were finally linked, and into which they were absorbed, so tosay. The individualization of man after death depended on the spirit, not on hissoul and body. Although the word \"personality,\" in the sense in which it isusually understood, is an absurdity, if applied literally to our immortalessence, still the latter is a distinct entity, immortal and eternal, per se;and, as in the case of criminals beyond redemption, when the shining threadwhich links the spirit to the soul, from the moment of the birth of a child, isviolently snapped, and the disembodied entity is left to share the fate of thelower animals, to gradually dissolve into ether, and have its individualityannihilated--even then the spirit remains a distinct being. It becomes a planetary spirit, an angel; for the gods of the Pagan or the archangels of theChristian, the direct emanations of the First Cause, notwithstanding thehazardous statement of Swedenborg, never were or will be men, on our planet, atleast. This specialization has been in all ages the stumbling-block of metaphysicians.The whole esoterism of the Buddhistical philosophy is based on this mysteriousteaching, understood by so few persons, and so totally misrepresented by many ofthe most learned scholars. Even metaphysicians are too inclined to confound theeffect with the cause. A person may have won his immortal life, and remain thesame inner-self he was on earth, throughout eternity; but this does not implynecessarily that he must either remain the Mr. Smith or Brown he was on earth,or lose his individuality. Therefore, the astral soul and terrestrial body ofman may, in the dark Hereafter, be absorbed into the cosmical ocean ofsublimated elements, and cease to feel his ego, if this ego did not deserve tosoar higher; and the divine spirit still remain an unchanged entity, though thisterrestrial experience of his emanations may be totally obliterated at theinstant of separation from the unworthy vehicle. If the \"spirit,\" or the divine portion of the soul, is preexistent as a distinctbeing from all eternity, as Origen, Synesius, and other Christian fathers andphilosophers taught, and if it is the same, and nothing more than themetaphysically-objective soul, how can it be otherwise than eternal? And whatmatters it in such a case, whether man leads an animal or a pure life, if, dowhat he may, he can never lose his individuality? This doctrine is as perniciousin its consequences as that of vicarious atonement. Had the latter dogma, incompany with the false idea that we are all immortal, been demonstrated to theworld in its true light, humanity would have been bettered by its propagation.Crime and sin would be avoided, not for fear of earthly punishment, or of aridiculous hell, but for the sake of that which lies the most deeply rooted inour inner nature--the desire of an individual and distinct life in thehereafter, the positive assurance that we cannot win it unless we \"take thekingdom of heaven by violence,\" and the conviction that neither human prayersnor the blood of another man will save us from individual destruction afterdeath, unless we firmly link ourselves during our terrestrial life with our ownimmortal spirit--our GOD. Pythagoras, Plato, Timaeus of Locris, and the whole Alexandrian school derivedthe soul from the universal World-Soul; and the latter was, according to theirown teachings--ether; something of such a fine nature as to be perceived only byour inner sight. Therefore, it cannot be the essence of the Monas, or cause,because the anima mundi is but the effect, the objective emanation of theformer. Both the human spirit and soul are preexistent. But, while the formerexists as a distinct entity, an individualization, the soul exists aspreexisting matter, an unscient portion of an intelligent whole. Both wereoriginally formed from the Eternal Ocean of Light; but as the theosophistsexpressed it, there is a visible as well as invisible spirit in fire. They madea difference between the anima bruta and the anima divina. Empedocles firmlybelieved all men and animals to possess two souls; and in Aristotle we find thathe calls one the reasoning soul--νους, and the other, the animal soul--ψυχε.According to these philosophers, the reasoning soul comes from without theuniversal soul, and the other from within. This divine and superior region, inwhich they located the invisible and supreme deity, was considered by them (byAristotle himself) as a fifth element, purely spiritual and divine, whereas theanima mundi proper was considered as composed of a fine, igneous, and etherealnature spread throughout the universe, in short--ether. The Stoics, the greatestmaterialists of ancient days, excepted the Invisible God and Divine Soul(Spirit) from any such a corporeal nature. Their modern commentators andadmirers, greedily seizing the opportunity, built on this ground the suppositionthat the Stoics believed in neither God nor soul. But Epicurus, whose doctrinemilitating directly against the agency of a Supreme Being and gods, in theformation or government of the world, placed him far above the Stoics in atheismand materialism, taught, nevertheless, that the soul is of a fine, tenderessence, formed from the smoothest, roundest, and finest atoms, whichdescription still brings us to the same sublimated ether. Arnobius, Tertullian,Irenaeus, and Origen, notwithstanding their Christianity, believed, with themore modern Spinoza and Hobbes, that the soul was corporeal, though of a veryfine nature. This doctrine of the possibility of losing one's soul and, hence, individuality,militates with the ideal theories and progressive ideas of some spiritualists,though Swedenborg fully adopts it. They will never accept the kabalisticdoctrine which teaches that it is only through observing the law of harmony thatindividual life hereafter can be obtained; and that the farther the inner andouter man deviate from this fount of harmony, whose source lies in our divinespirit, the more difficult it is to regain the ground. But while the spiritualists and other adherents of Christianity have little ifany perception of this fact of the possible death and obliteration of the humanpersonality by the separation of the immortal part from the perishable, theSwedenborgians fully comprehend it. One of the most respected ministers of theNew Church, the Rev. Chauncey Giles, D.D., of New York, recently elucidated thesubject in a public discourse as follows: Physical death, or the death of thebody, was a provision of the divine economy for the benefit of man, a provisionby means of which he attained the higher ends of his being. But there is anotherdeath which is the interruption of the divine order and the destruction of everyhuman element in man's nature, and every possibility of human happiness. This isthe spiritual death, which takes place before the dissolution of the body.\"There may be a vast development of man's natural mind without that developmentbeing accompanied by a particle of love of God, or of unselfish love of man.\"When one falls into a love of self and love of the world, with its pleasures,losing the divine love of God and of the neighbor, he falls from life to death.The higher principles which constitute the essential elements of his humanityperish, and he lives only on the natural plane of his faculties. Physically heexists, spiritually he is dead. To all that pertain to the higher and the onlyenduring phase of existence he is as much dead as his body becomes dead to allthe activities, delights, and sensations of the world when the spirit has leftit. This spiritual death results from disobedience of the laws of spirituallife, which is followed by the same penalty as the disobedience of the laws ofthe natural life. But the spiritually dead have still their delights; they havetheir intellectual endowments and power, and intense activities. All the animaldelights are theirs, and to multitudes of men and women these constitute thehighest ideal of human happiness. The tireless pursuit of riches, of theamusements and entertainments of social life; the cultivation of graces ofmanner, of taste in dress, of social preferment, of scientific distinction,intoxicate and enrapture these dead-alive; but, the eloquent preacher remarks,\"these creatures, with all their graces, rich attire, and brilliantaccomplishments, are dead in the eye of the Lord and the angels, and whenmeasured by the only true and immutable standard have no more genuine life thanskeletons whose flesh has turned to dust.\" A high development of theintellectual faculties does not imply spiritual and true life. Many of ourgreatest scientists are but animate corpses--they have no spiritual sightbecause their spirits have left them. So we might go through all ages, examineall occupations, weigh all human attainments, and investigate all forms ofsociety, and we would find these spiritually dead everywhere. Pythagoras taught that the entire universe is one vast system of mathematicallycorrect combinations. Plato shows the deity geometrizing. The world is sustainedby the same law of equilibrium and harmony upon which it was built. Thecentripetal force could not manifest itself without the centrifugal in theharmonious revolutions of the spheres; all forms are the product of this dualforce in nature. Thus, to illustrate our case, we may designate the spirit asthe centrifugal, and the soul as the centripetal, spiritual energies. When inperfect harmony, both forces produce one result; break or damage the centripetalmotion of the earthly soul tending toward the centre which attracts it; arrestits progress by clogging it with a heavier weight of matter than it can bear,and the harmony of the whole, which was its life, is destroyed. Individual lifecan only be continued if sustained by this two-fold force. The least deviationfrom harmony damages it; when it is destroyed beyond redemption the forcesseparate and the form is gradually annihilated. After the death of the depravedand the wicked, arrives the critical moment. If during life the ultimate anddesperate effort of the inner-self to reunite itself with the faintly-glimmeringray of its divine parent is neglected; if this ray is allowed to be more andmore shut out by the thickening crust of matter, the soul, once freed from thebody, follows its earthly attractions, and is magnetically drawn into and heldwithin the dense fogs of the material atmosphere. Then it begins to sink lowerand lower, until it finds itself, when returned to consciousness, in what theancients termed Hades. The annihilation of such a soul is never instantaneous;it may last centuries, perhaps; for nature never proceeds by jumps and starts,and the astral soul being formed of elements, the law of evolution must bide itstime. Then begins the fearful law of compensation, the Yin-youan of theBuddhists. This class of spirits are called the \"terrestrial\" or \"earthly elementary,\" incontradistinction to the other classes, as we have shown in the introductorychapter. In the East they are known as the \"Brothers of the Shadow.\" Cunning,low, vindictive, and seeking to retaliate their sufferings upon humanity, theybecome, until final annihilation, vampires, ghouls, and prominent actors. Theseare the leading \"stars\" on the great spiritual stage of \"materialization,\" whichphenomena they perform with the help of the more intelligent of the genuine-born\"elemental\" creatures, which hover around and welcome them with delight in theirown spheres. Henry Kunrath, the great German kabalist, has on a plate of hisrare work, Amphitheatri Sapientiae AEternae, representations of the four classesof these human \"elementary spirits.\" Once past the threshold of the sanctuary ofinitiation, once that an adept has lifted the \"Veil of Isis,\" the mysterious andjealous goddess, he has nothing to fear; but till then he is in constant danger. Although Aristotle himself, anticipating the modern physiologists, regarded thehuman mind as a material substance, and ridiculed the hylozoists, neverthelesshe fully believed in the existence of a \"double\" soul, or spirit and soul. * Helaughed at Strabo for believing that any particles of matter, per se, could havelife and intellect in themselves sufficient to fashion by degrees such amultiform world as ours. * Aristotle is indebted for the sublime morality of hisNichomachean Ethics to a thorough study of the Pythagoric Ethical Fragments; forthe latter can be easily shown to have been the source at which he gathered hisideas, though he might not have sworn \"by him who the tetractys found.\" **Finally, what do we know so certain about Aristotle? His philosophy is soabstruse that he constantly leaves his reader to supply by the imagination themissing links of his logical deductions. Moreover, we know that before his worksever reached our scholars, who delight in his seemingly atheistical arguments insupport of his doctrine of fate, these works passed through too many hands tohave remained immaculate. From Theophrastus, his legator, they passed to Neleus,whose heirs kept them mouldering in subterranean caves for nearly 150 years; ***after which, we learn that his manuscripts were copied and much augmented byApellicon of Theos, who supplied such paragraphs as had become illegible, byconjectures of his own, probably many of these drawn from the depths of hisinner consciousness. Our scholars of the nineteenth century might certainlyprofit well by Aristotle's example, were they as anxious to imitate himpractically as they are to throw his inductive method and materialistic theoriesat the head of the Platonists. We invite them to collect facts as carefully ashe did, instead of denying those they know nothing about. What we have said in the introductory chapter and elsewhere, of mediums and thetendency of their mediumship, is not based upon conjecture, but upon actualexperience and observation. There is scarcely one phase of mediumship, of eitherkind, that we have not seen exemplified during the past twenty-five years, invarious countries. India, Thibet, Borneo, Siam, Egypt, Asia Minor, America(North and South), and other parts of the world, have each displayed to us itspeculiar phase of mediumistic phenomena and magical power. Our varied experiencehas taught us two important truths, viz.: that for the exercise of the latterpersonal purity and the exercise of a trained and indomitable will-power areindispensable; and that spiritualists can never assure themselves of thegenuineness of mediumistic manifestations, unless they occur in the light andunder such reasonable test conditions as would make an attempted fraud instantlynoticed. For fear of being misunderstood, we would remark that while, as a rule, physicalphenomena are produced by the nature-spirits, of their own motion and to pleasetheir own fancy, still good disembodied human spirits, under exceptionalcircumstances, such as the aspiration of a pure heart or the occurrence of somefavoring emergency, can manifest their presence by any of the phenomena exceptpersonal materialization. But it must be a mighty attraction indeed to draw apure, disembodied spirit from its radiant home into the foul atmosphere fromwhich it escaped upon leaving its earthly body. Magi and theurgic philosophers objected most severely to the \"evocation ofsouls.\" \"Bring her (the soul) not forth, lest in departing she retainsomething,\" says Psellus. * \"It becomes you not to behold them before your body is initiated,Since, by always alluring, they seduce the souls of the uninitiated,\"says the same philosopher, in another passage. ** They objected to it for several good reasons. 1. \"It is extremely difficult todistinguish a good daemon from a bad one,\" says Iamblichus. 2. If a human soulsucceeds in penetrating the density of the earth's atmosphere--always oppressiveto her, often hateful--still there is a danger the soul is unable to come intoproximity with the material world without that she cannot avoid; \"departing, sheretains something,\" that is to say, contaminating her purity, for which she hasto suffer more or less after her departure. Therefore, the true theurgist willavoid causing any more suffering to this pure denizen of the higher sphere thanis absolutely required by the interests of humanity. It is only the practitionerof black magic who compels the presence, by the powerful incantations ofnecromancy, of the tainted souls of such as have lived bad lives, and are readyto aid his selfish designs. Of intercourse with the Augoeides, through themediumistic powers of subjective mediums, we elsewhere speak. The theurgistsemployed chemicals and mineral substances to chase away evil spirits. Of thelatter, a stone called Μνιζουριν was one of the most powerful agents. \"When you shall see a terrestrial demon approaching,Exclaim, and sacrifice the stone Mnizurin,\"exclaims a Zoroastrian oracle (Psel., 40). And now, to descend from the eminence of theurgico-magian poetry to the\"unconscious\" magic of our present century, and the prose of a modern kabalist,we will review it in the following: In Dr. Morin's Journal de Magnetisme, published a few years since in Paris, at atime when the \"table-turning\" was raging in France, a curious letter waspublished. \"Believe me, sir,\" wrote the anonymous correspondent, \"that there are nospirits, no ghosts, no angels, no demons enclosed in a table; but, all of thesecan be found there, nevertheless, for that depends on our own wills and ourimaginations. . . . This MENSAbulism *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu008.htm#fn_474] is an ancient phenomenon .. . misunderstood by us moderns, but natural, for all that, and which pertainsto physics and psychology; unfortunately, it had to remain incomprehensibleuntil the discovery of electricity and heliography, as, to explain a fact ofspiritual nature, we are obliged to base ourselves on a corresponding fact of amaterial order. . . . \"As we all know, the daguerreotype-plate may be impressed, not only by objects,but also by their reflections. Well, the phenomenon in question, which ought tobe named mental photography, produces, besides realities, the dreams of ourimagination, with such a fidelity that very often we become unable todistinguish a copy taken from one present, from a negative obtained of an image.. . . \"The magnetization of a table or of a person is absolutely identical in itsresults; it is the saturation of a foreign body by either the intelligent vitalelectricity, or the thought of the magnetizer and those present.\" Nothing can give a better or a more just idea of it than the electric batterygathering the fluid on its conductor, to obtain thereof a brute force whichmanifests itself in sparks of light, etc. Thus, the electricity accumulated onan isolated body acquires a power of reaction equal to the action, either forcharging, magnetizing, decomposing, inflaming, or for discharging its vibrationsfar away. These are the visible effects of the blind, or crude electricityproduced by blind elements--the word blind being used by the table itself incontradistinction to the intelligent electricity. But there evidently exists acorresponding electricity produced by the cerebral pile of man; thissoul-electricity, this spiritual and universal ether, which is the ambient,middle nature of the metaphysical universe, or rather of the incorporealuniverse, has to be studied before it is admitted by science, which, having noidea of it, will never know anything of the great phenomenon of life until shedoes. \"It appears that to manifest itself the cerebral electricity requires the helpof the ordinary statical electricity; when the latter is lacking in theatmosphere--when the air is very damp, for instance--you can get little ornothing of either tables or mediums. . . . \"There is no need for the ideas to be formulated very precisely in the brains ofthe persons present; the table discovers and formulates them itself, in eitherprose or verse, but always correctly; the table requires time to compose averse; it begins, then it erases a word, corrects it, and sometimes sends backthe epigram to our address . . . if the persons present are in sympathy witheach other, it jokes and laughs with us as any living person could. As to thethings of the exterior world, it has to content itself with conjectures, as wellas ourselves; it (the table) composes little philosophical systems, discussesand maintains them as the most cunning rhetorician might. In short, it createsitself a conscience and a reason properly belonging to itself, but with thematerials it finds in us. . . . \"The Americans are persuaded that they talk with their dead; some think (moretruly) that these are spirits; others take them for angels; others again fordevils . . . (the intelligence) assuming the shape which fits the conviction andpreconceived opinion of every one; so did the initiates of the temples ofSerapis, of Delphi, and other theurgico-medical establishments of the same kind.They were convinced beforehand that they would communicate with their gods; andthey never failed. \"We, who well know the value of the phenomenon . . . are perfectly sure thatafter having charged the table with our magnetic efflux, we have called to life,or created an intelligence analogous to our own, which like ourselves is endowedwith a free will, can talk and discuss with us, with a degree of superiorlucidity, considering that the resultant is stronger than the individual, orrather the whole is larger than a part of it. . . . We must not accuse Herodotusof telling us fibs when he records the most extraordinary circumstances, for wemust hold them to be as true and correct as the rest of historical facts whichare to be found in all the Pagan writers of antiquity. . . . \"The phenomenon is as old as the world. . . . The priests of India and Chinapracticed it before the Egyptians and the Greeks. The savages and the Esquimauxknow it well. It is the phenomenon of Faith, sole source of every prodigy,\" andit will be done to you according to your faith. The one who enunciated thisprofound doctrine was verily the incarnated word of Truth; he neither deceivedhimself, nor wanted to deceive others; he expounded an axiom which we nowrepeat, without much hope of seeing it accepted. \"Man is a microcosm, or a little world; he carries in him a fragment of thegreat All, in a chaotic state. The task of our half-gods is to disentangle fromit the share belonging to them by an incessant mental and material labor. Theyhave their task to do, the perpetual invention of new products, of newmoralities, and the proper arrangement of the crude and formless materialfurnished them by the Creator, who created them in His own image, that theyshould create in their turn and so complete here the work of the Creation; animmense labor which can be achieved only when the whole will become so perfect,that it will be like unto God Himself, and thus able to survive to itself. Weare very far yet from that final moment, for we can say that everything is to bedone, to be undone, and outdone as yet on our globe, institutions, machinery,and products. \"Mens non solum agitat sed creat molem.\"We live in this life, in an ambient, intellectual centre, which entertainsbetween human beings and things a necessary and perpetual solidarity; everybrain is a ganglion, a station of a universal neurological telegraphy inconstant rapport with the central and other stations by the vibrations ofthought. \"The spiritual sun shines for souls as the material sun shines for bodies, forthe universe is double and follows the law of couples. The ignorant operatorinterprets erroneously the divine dispatches, and often delivers them in a falseand ridiculous manner. Thus study and true science alone can destroy thesuperstitions and nonsense spread by the ignorant interpreters placed at thestations of teaching among every people in this world. These blind interpretersof the Verbum, the WORD, have always tried to impose on their pupils theobligation to swear to everything without examination in verba magistri. \"Alas! we could wish for nothing better were they to translate correctly theinner voices, which voices never deceive but those who have false spirits inthem. 'It is our duty,' they say, 'to interpret oracles; it is we who havereceived the exclusive mission for it from heaven, spiritus flat ubi vult, andit blows on us alone. . . .' \"It blows on every one, and the rays of the spiritual light illuminate everyconscience; and when all the bodies and all the minds will reflect equally thisdual light, people will see a great deal clearer than they do now.\" We have translated and quoted the above fragments for their great originalityand truthfulness. We know the writer; fame proclaims him a great kabalist, and afew friends know him as a truthful and honest man. The letter shows, moreover, that the writer has well and carefully studied thechameleon-like nature of the intelligences presiding over spiritual circles.That they are of the same kind and race as those so frequently mentioned inantiquity, admits of as little doubt as that the present generation of men areof the same nature as were human beings in the days of Moses. Subjectivemanifestations proceed, under harmonious conditions, from those beings whichwere known as the \"good demons\" in days of old. Sometimes, but rarely, theplanetary spirits--beings of another race than our own--produce them; sometimesthe spirits of our translated and beloved friends; sometimes nature-spirits ofone or more of the countless tribes; but most frequently of all terrestrialelementary spirits, disembodied evil men, the Diakka of A. Jackson Davis. We do not forget what we have elsewhere written about subjective and objectivemediumistic phenomena. We keep the distinction always in mind. There are goodand bad of both classes. An impure medium will attract to his impure inner self,the vicious, depraved, malignant influences as inevitably as one that is puredraws only those that are good and pure. Of the latter kind of medium where cana nobler example be found than the gentle Baroness Adelma von Vay, of Austria(born Countess Wurmbrandt), who is described to us by a correspondent as \"theProvidence of her neighborhood\"? She uses her mediumistic power to heal the sickand comfort the afflicted. To the rich she is a phenomenon; but to the poor aministering angel. For many years she has seen and recognized the nature-spiritsor cosmic elementaries, and found them always friendly. But this was because shewas a pure, good woman. Other correspondents of the Theosophical Society havenot fared so well at the hands of these apish and impish beings. The Havannacase, elsewhere described, is an example. Though spiritualists discredit them ever so much, these nature-spirits arerealities. If the gnomes, sylphs, salamanders, and undines of the Rosicruciansexisted in their days, they must exist now. Bulwer-Lytton's Dweller of theThreshold, is a modern conception, modelled on the ancient type of theSulanuth * of the Hebrews and Egyptians, which is mentioned in the Book ofJasher. ** The Christians call them \"devils,\" \"imps of Satan,\" and like characteristicnames. They are nothing of the kind, but simply creatures of ethereal matter,irresponsible, and neither good nor bad, unless influenced by a superiorintelligence. It is very extraordinary to hear devout Catholics abuse andmisrepresent the nature-spirits, when one of their greatest authorities, Clementthe Alexandrian, disposed of them, by describing these creatures as they reallyare. Clement, who perhaps had been a theurgist as well as a Neo-platonist, thusarguing upon good authority, remarks, that it is absurd to call them devils, *for they are only inferior angels, \"the powers which inhabit elements, move thewinds and distribute showers, and as such are agents and subject to God.\" **Origen, who before he became a Christian also belonged to the Platonic school,is of the same opinion. Porphyry describes these daemons more carefully than anyone else. When the possible nature of the manifesting intelligences, which sciencebelieves to be a \"psychic force,\" and spiritualists the identical spirits of thedead, is better known, then will academicians and believers turn to the oldphilosophers for information. Let us for a moment imagine an intelligent orang-outang or some Africananthropoid ape disembodied, i.e., deprived of its physical and in possession ofan astral, if not an immortal body. We have found in spiritual journals manyinstances where apparitions of departed pet dogs and other animals have beenseen. Therefore, upon spiritualistic testimony, we must think that such animal\"spirits\" do appear although we reserve the right of concurring with theancients that the forms are but tricks of the elementals. Once open the door ofcommunication between the terrestrial and the spiritual world, what prevents theape from producing physical phenomena such as he sees human spirits produce. Andwhy may not these excel in cleverness of ingenuity many of those which have beenwitnessed in spiritual circles? Let spiritualists answer. The orang-outang ofBorneo is little, if any, inferior to the savage man in intelligence. Mr.Wallace and other great naturalists give instances of its wonderful acuteness,although its brains are inferior in cubic capacity to the most undeveloped ofsavages. These apes lack but speech to be men of low grade. The sentinels placedby monkeys; the sleeping chambers selected and built by orang-outangs; theirprevision of danger and calculations, which show more than instinct; theirchoice of leaders whom they obey; and the exercise of many of their faculties,certainly entitle them to a place at least on a level with many a flat-headedAustralian. Says Mr. Wallace, \"The mental requirements of savages, and thefaculties actually exercised by them, are very little above those of theanimals.\" Now, people assume that there can be no apes in the other world, because apeshave no \"souls.\" But apes have as much intelligence, it appears, as some men;why, then, should these men, in no way superior to the apes, have immortalspirits, and the apes none? The materialists will answer that neither the onenor the other has a spirit, but that annihilation overtakes each at physicaldeath. But the spiritual philosophers of all times have agreed that man occupiesa step one degree higher than the animal, and is possessed of that somethingwhich it lacks, be he the most untutored of savages or the wisest ofphilosophers. The ancients, as we have seen, taught that while man is a trinityof body, astral spirit, and immortal soul, the animal is but a duality--a beinghaving a physical body and an astral spirit animating it. Scientists candistinguish no difference in the elements composing the bodies of men andbrutes; and the kabalists agree with them so far as to say that the astralbodies (or, as the physicists would call it, \"the life-principle\") of animalsand men are identical in essence. Physical man is but the highest development ofanimal life. If, as the scientists tell us, even thought is matter, and everysensation of pain or pleasure, every transient desire is accompanied by adisturbance of ether; and those bold speculators, the authors of the UnseenUniverse believe that thought is conceived \"to affect the matter of anotheruniverse simultaneously with this\"; why, then, should not the gross, brutishthought of an orang-outang, or a dog, impressing itself on the ethereal waves ofthe astral light, as well as that of man, assure the animal a continuity of lifeafter death, or \"a future state\"? The kabalists held, and now hold, that it is unphilosophical to admit that theastral body of man can survive corporeal death, and at the same time assert thatthe astral body of the ape is resolved into independent molecules. That whichsurvives as an individuality after the death of the body is the astral soul,which Plato, in the Timaeus and Gorgias, calls the mortal soul, for, accordingto the Hermetic doctrine, it throws off its more material particles at everyprogressive change into a higher sphere. Socrates narrates to Callicles *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu008.htm#fn_479] that this mortal soulretains all the characteristics of the body after the death of the latter; somuch so, indeed, that a man marked with the whip will have his astral body \"fullof the prints and scars.\" The astral spirit is a faithful duplicate of the body,both in a physical and spiritual sense. The Divine, the highest and immortalspirit, can be neither punished nor rewarded. To maintain such a doctrine wouldbe at the same time absurd and blasphemous, for it is not merely a flame lit atthe central and inexhaustible fountain of light, but actually a portion of it,and of identical essence. It assures immortality to the individual astral beingin proportion to the willingness of the latter to receive it. So long as thedouble man, i.e., the man of flesh and spirit, keeps within the limits of thelaw of spiritual continuity; so long as the divine spark lingers in him, howeverfaintly, he is on the road to an immortality in the future state. But those whoresign themselves to a materialistic existence, shutting out the divine radianceshed by their spirit, at the beginning of the earthly pilgrimage, and stiflingthe warning voice of that faithful sentry, the conscience, which serves as afocus for the light in the soul--such beings as these, having left behindconscience and spirit, and crossed the boundaries of matter, will of necessityhave to follow its laws. Matter is as indestructible and eternal as the immortal spirit itself, but onlyin its particles, and not as organized forms. The body of so grosslymaterialistic a person as above described, having been deserted by its spiritbefore physical death, when that event occurs, the plastic material, astralsoul, following the laws of blind matter, shapes itself thoroughly into themould which vice has been gradually preparing for it through the earth-life ofthe individual. Then, as Plato says, it assumes the form of that \"animal towhich it resembled in its evil ways\" * during life. \"It is an ancient saying,\"he tells us, \"that the souls departing hence exist in Hades and return hitheragain and are produced from the dead ** . . . But those who are found to havelived an eminently holy life, these are they who arrive at the pure abode ABOVEand DWELL ON THE UPPER PARTS of the earth\" *** (the ethereal region). InPhaedrus, again, he says that when man has ended his first life (on earth), somego to places of punishment beneath the earth. **** This region below the earth,the kabalists do not understand as a place inside the earth, but maintain it tobe a sphere, far inferior in perfection to the earth, and far more material. Of all the modern speculators upon the seeming incongruities of the NewTestament, alone the authors of the Unseen Universe seem to have caught aglimpse of its kabalistic truths, respecting the gehenna of the universe. *****This gehenna, termed by the occultists the eighth sphere (numbering inversely),is merely a planet like our own, attached to the latter and following it in itspenumbra; a kind of dust-hole, a \"place where all its garbage and filth isconsumed,\" to borrow an expression of the above-mentioned authors, and on whichall the dross and scorification of the cosmic matter pertaining to our planet isin a continual state of remodelling. The secret doctrine teaches that man, if he wins immortality, will remainforever the trinity that he is in life, and will continue so throughout all thespheres. The astral body, which in this life is covered by a gross physicalenvelope, becomes--when relieved of that covering by the process of corporealdeath--in its turn the shell of another and more ethereal body. This beginsdeveloping from the moment of death, and becomes perfected when the astral bodyof the earthly form finally separates from it. This process, they say, isrepeated at every new transition from sphere to sphere. But the immortal soul,\"the silvery spark,\" observed by Dr. Fenwick in Margrave's brain, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu008.htm#fn_485] and not found by him inthe animals, never changes, but remains indestructible \"by aught that shattersits tabernacle.\" The descriptions by Porphyry and Iamblichus and others, of thespirits of animals, which inhabit the astral light, are corroborated by those ofmany of the most trustworthy and intelligent clairvoyants. Sometimes the animalforms are even made visible to every person present at a spiritual circle, bybeing materialized. In his People from the Other World, Colonel H. S. Olcottdescribes a materialized squirrel which followed a spirit-woman into the view ofthe spectators, disappeared and reappeared before their eyes several times, andfinally followed the spirit into the cabinet. Let us advance another step in our argument. If there is such a thing asexistence in the spiritual world after corporeal death, then it must occur inaccordance with the law of evolution. It takes man from his place at the apex ofthe pyramid of matter, and lifts him into a sphere of existence where the sameinexorable law follows him. And if it follows him, why not everything else innature? Why not animals and plants, which have all a life-principle, and whosegross forms decay like his, when that life-principle leaves them? If his astralbody becomes more ethereal upon attaining the other sphere, why not theirs?They, as well as he, have been evolved out of condensed cosmic matter, and ourphysicists cannot see the slightest difference between the molecules of the fourkingdoms of nature, which are thus specified by Professor Le Conte: 4. Animal Kingdom.3. Vegetable Kingdom.2. Mineral Kingdom.1. Elements.The progress of matter from each of these planes to the plane above iscontinuous; and, according to Le Conte, there is no force in nature capable ofraising matter at once from No. 1 to No. 3, or from No. 2 to No. 4, withoutstopping and receiving an accession of force of a different kind on theintermediate plane. Now, will any one presume to say that out of a given number of molecules,originally and constantly homogeneous, and all energized by the same principleof evolution, a certain number can be carried through those four kingdoms to thefinal result of evolving immortal man, and the others not be allowed to progressbeyond planes 1, 2, and 3? Why should not all these molecules have an equalfuture before them; the mineral becoming plant, the plant, animal, and theanimal, man--if not upon this earth, at least somewhere in the boundless realmsof space? The harmony which geometry and mathematics--the only exactsciences--demonstrate to be the law of the universe, would be destroyed ifevolution were perfectly exemplified in man alone and limited in the subordinatekingdoms. What logic suggests, psychometry proves; and, as we said before, it isnot unlikely that a monument will one day be erected by men of science to JosephR. Buchanan, its modern discoverer. If a fragment of mineral, fossilized plant,or animal form gives the psychometer as vivid and accurate pictures of theirprevious conditions, as a fragment of human bone does of those of the individualto which it belonged, it would seem as if the same subtile spirit pervaded allnature, and was inseparable from organic or inorganic substances. Ifanthropologists, physiologists, and psychologists are equally perplexed byprimal and final causes, and by finding in matter so much similarity in all itsforms, but in spirit such abysses of difference, it is, perhaps, because theirinquiries are limited to our visible globe, and that they cannot, or dare not,go beyond. The spirit of a mineral, plant, or animal, may begin to form here,and reach its final development millions of ages hereafter, on other planets,known or unknown, visible or invisible to astronomers. For, who is able tocontrovert the theory previously suggested, that the earth itself will, like theliving creatures to which it has given birth, ultimately, and after passingthrough its own stage of death and dissolution, become an etherealized astralplanet? \"As above, so below\"; harmony is the great law of nature. Harmony in the physical and mathematical world of sense, is justice in thespiritual one. Justice produces harmony, and injustice, discord; and discord, ona cosmical scale, means chaos--annihilation. If there is a developed immortal spirit in man, it must be in every thing else,at least in a latent or germinal state, and it can only be a question of timefor each of these germs to become fully developed. What gross injustice it wouldbe for an impenitent criminal man, the perpetrator of a brutal murder when inthe exercise of his free will, to have all immortal spirit which in time may bewashed clean of sin, and enjoying perfect happiness, while a poor horse,innocent of all crime, should toil and suffer under the merciless torture of hismaster's whip during a whole life, and then be annihilated at death? Such abelief implies a brutal injustice, and is only possible among people taught inthe dogma that everything is created for man, and he alone is the sovereign ofthe universe;--a sovereign so mighty that to save him from the consequences ofhis own misdeeds, it was not too much that the God of the universe should die toplacate his own just wrath. If the most abject savage, with a brain \"very little inferior to that of aphilosopher\" * (the latter developed physically by ages of civilization), isstill, as regards the actual exercise of his mental faculties, very littlesuperior to an animal, is it just to infer that both he and the ape will nothave the opportunity to become philosophers; the ape in this world, the man onsome other planet peopled equally with beings created in some other image ofGod? Says Professor Denton, when speaking of the future of psychometry: \"Astronomywill not disdain the assistance of this power. As new forms of organic being arerevealed, when we go back to the earlier geologic periods, so new groupings ofthe stars, new constellations, will be displayed, when the heavens of thoseearly periods are examined by the piercing gaze of future psychometers. Anaccurate map of the starry heavens during the Silurian period may reveal to usmany secrets that we have been unable to discover. . . . Why may we not indeedbe able to read the history of the various heavenly bodies . . . theirgeological, their natural, and, perchance, their human history? . . . I havegood reason to believe that trained psychometers will be able to travel fromplanet to planet, and read their present condition minutely, and their pasthistory.\" ** Herodotus tells us that in the eighth of the towers of Belus, in Babylon, usedby the sacerdotal astrologers, there was an uppermost room, a sanctuary, wherethe prophesying priestesses slept to receive communications from the god. Besidethe couch stood a table of gold, upon which were laid various stones, whichManetho informs us were all aerolites. The priestesses developed the propheticvision in themselves by pressing one of these sacred stones against their headsand bosoms. The same took place at Thebes, and at Patara, in Lycia. *** This would seem to indicate that psychometry was known and extensively practicedby the ancients. We have somewhere seen it stated that the profound knowledgepossessed, according to Draper, by the ancient Chaldean astrologers, of theplanets and their relations, was obtained more by the divination of the betylos,or the meteoric stone, than by astronomical instruments. Strabo, Pliny,Hellanicus--all speak of the electrical, or electromagnetic power of the betyli.They were worshipped in the remotest antiquity in Egypt and Samothrace, asmagnetic stones, \"containing souls which had fallen from heaven\"; and thepriests of Cybele wore a small betylos on their bodies. How curious thecoincidence between the practice of the priests of Belus and the experiments ofProfessor Denton! As Professor Buchanan truthfully remarks of psychometry, it will enable us \" . .. to detect vice and crime. No criminal act . . . can escape the detection ofpsychometry, when its powers are properly brought forth . . . the sure detectionof guilt by psychometry (no matter how secret the act) will nullify allconcealment.\" * Speaking of the elementary, Porphyry says: \"These invisible beings have beenreceiving from men honors as gods . . . a universal belief makes them capable ofbecoming very malevolent: it proves that their wrath is kindled against thosewho neglect to offer them a legitimate worship.\" ** Homer describes them in the following terms: \"Our gods appear to us when weoffer them sacrifice . . . sitting themselves at our tables, they partake of ourfestival meals. Whenever they meet on his travels a solitary Phoenician, theyserve to him as guides, and otherwise manifest their presence. We can say thatour piety approaches us to them as much as crime and bloodshed unite theCyclopes and the ferocious race of giants.\" *** The latter proving that thesegods were kind and beneficent daemons, and that, whether they were disembodiedspirits or elementary beings, they were no devils. The language of Porphyry, who was himself a direct disciple of Plotinus, isstill more explicit as to the nature of these spirits. \"Demons,\" he says, \"areinvisible; but they know how to clothe themselves with forms and configurationssubjected to numerous variations, which can be explained by their nature havingmuch of the corporeal in itself. Their abode is in the neighborhood of the earth. . . and when they can escape the vigilance of the good daemons, there is nomischief they will not dare commit. One day they will employ brute force;another, cunning.\" **** Further, he says: \"It is a child's play for them toarouse in us vile passions, to impart to societies and nations turbulentdoctrines, provoking wars, seditions, and other public calamities, and then tellyou 'that all of these is the work of the gods.' . . . These spirits pass theirtime in cheating and deceiving mortals, creating around them illusions andprodigies; their greatest ambition is to pass as gods and souls (disembodiedspirits).\" * Iamblichus, the great theurgist of the Neo-platonic school, a man skilled insacred magic, teaches that \"good daemons appear to us in reality, while the badones can manifest themselves but under the shadowy forms of phantoms.\" Further,he corroborates Porphyry, and tells that \" . . . the good ones fear not thelight, while the wicked ones require darkness. . . . The sensations they excitein us make us believe in the presence and reality of things they show, thoughthese things be absent.\" ** Even the most practiced theurgists found danger sometimes in their dealings withcertain elementaries, and we have Iamblichus stating that, \"The gods, theangels, and the daemons, as well as the souls, may be summoned through evocationand prayer. . . . But when, during theurgic operations, a mistake is made,beware! Do not imagine that you are communicating with beneficent divinities,who have answered your earnest prayer; no, for they are bad daemons, only underthe guise of good ones! For the elementaries often clothe themselves with thesimilitude of the good, and assume a rank very much superior to that they reallyoccupy. Their boasting betrays them.\" *** Some twenty years since, Baron Du Potet, disgusted with the indifference of thescientists, who persisted in seeing in the greatest psychological phenomena onlythe result of clever trickery, gave vent to his indignation in the followingterms: \"Here am I, on my way, I may truly say, to the land of marvels! I am preparingto shock every opinion, and provoke laughter in our most illustrious scientists. . . for I am convinced that agents of an immense potency exist outside of us;that they can enter in us; move our limbs and organs; and use us as they please.It was, after all, the belief of our fathers and of the whole of antiquity.Every religion admitted the reality of spiritual agents. . . . Recallinginnumerable phenomena which I have produced in the sight of thousands ofpersons, seeing the beastly indifference of official science, in presence of adiscovery which transports the mind into the regions of the unknown [sic]; anold man, at the very moment when I ought to be just being born. . . . I am notsure if it would not have been better for me to have shared the commonignorance. \"I have suffered calumnies to be written without refuting them. . . . At onetime it is simple ignorance which speaks, and I am silent; at another still,superficiality, raising its voice, makes a bluster, and I find myself hesitatingwhether or not to speak. Is this indifference or laziness? Has fear the power toparalyze my spirit? No; none of these causes affect me; I know simply that it isnecessary to prove what one asserts, and this restrains me. For, in justifyingmy assertions, in showing the living FACT, which proves my sincerity and thetruth, I translate OUTSIDE THE PRECINCTS OF THE TEMPLE the sacred inscription,WHICH NO PROFANE EYE SHOULD EVER READ. \"You doubt sorcery and magic? O, truth! thy possession is a heavy burden!\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu008.htm#fn_496] With a bigotry which one might search for in vain outside the church in whoseinterest he writes, des Mousseaux quotes the above language, as proof positivethat this devoted savant, and all who share his belief, have given themselvesover to the dominion of the Evil One! Self-complacency is the most serious obstacle to the enlightenment of the modernspiritualist. His thirty years' experience with the phenomena seem to himsufficient to have established intermundane intercourse upon an unassailablebasis. His thirty years have not only brought to him the conviction that thedead communicate and thus prove the spirit's immortality, but also settled inhis mind an idea that little or nothing can be learned of the other world,except through mediums. For the spiritualists, the records of the past either do not exist, or if theyare familiar with its gathered treasures, they regard them as having no bearingupon their own experiences. And yet, the problems which so vex them, were solvedthousands of years ago by the theurgists, who have left the keys to those whowill search for them in the proper spirit and with knowledge. Is it possiblethat nature has changed her work, and that we are encountering different spiritsand different laws from those of old? Or can any spiritualist imagine that heknows more, or even as much about mediumistic phenomena or the nature of variousspirits, as a priest-caste who spent their lives in theurgical practice, whichhad been known and studied for countless centuries? If the narratives of Owenand Hare, of Edmonds, and Crookes, and Wallace are credible, why not those ofHerodotus, the \"Father of History,\" of Iamblichus, and Porphyry, and hundreds ofother ancient authors? If the spiritualists have their phenomena undertest-conditions, so had the old theurgists, whose records, moreover, show thatthey could produce and vary them at will. The day when this fact shall berecognized, and profitless speculations of modern investigators shall give placeto patient study of the works of the theurgists, will mark the dawn of new andimportant discoveries in the field of psychology.

For it thereis no evidence as to the relations between spirit, soul, and body, either beforeor after death. The mere life-principle itself presents an unsolvable enigma,upon the study of which materialism has vainly exhausted its intellectualpowers. In the presence of a corpse the skeptical physiologist stands dumb whenasked by his pupil whence came the former tenant of that empty box, and whitherit has gone. The pupil must either, like his master, rest satisfied with theexplanation that protoplasm made the man, and force vitalized and will nowconsume his body, or he must go outside the walls of his college and the booksof its library to find an explanation of the mystery. It is sometimes as interesting as instructive to follow the two great rivals,science and theology, in their frequent skirmishes. Not all of the sons of theChurch are as unsuccessful in their attempts at advocacy as the poor AbbeMoigno, of Paris. This respectable, and no doubt well-meaning divine, in hisfruitless attempt to refute the free-thinking arguments of Huxley, Tyndall, DuBois-Raymond, and many others, has met with a sad failure. In his antidotalarguments his success was more than doubtful, and, as a reward for his trouble,the \"Congregation of the Index\" forbids the circulation of his book among thefaithful. It is a dangerous experiment to engage in a single-handed duel with scientistson topics which are well demonstrated by experimental research. In what they doknow they are unassailable, and until the old formula is destroyed by their ownhands and replaced by a more newly-discovered one, there is no use fightingagainst Achilles--unless, indeed, one is fortunate enough to catch theswift-footed god by his vulnerable heel. This heel is--what they confess they donot know! That was a cunning device to which a certain well-known preacher resorted toreach this mortal part. Before we proceed to narrate the extraordinary thoughwell authenticated facts with which we intend to fill this chapter, it will begood policy to show once more how fallible is modern science as to every fact innature which can be tested neither by retort nor crucible. The following are afew fragments from a series of sermons by F. Felix, of Notre Dame, entitledMystery and Science. They are worthy to be translated for and quoted in a workwhich is undertaken in precisely the same spirit as that exhibited by thepreacher. For once the Church silenced for a time the arrogance of hertraditional enemy, in the face of the learned academicians. It was known that the great preacher, in response to the general desire of thefaithful, and perhaps to the orders of ecclesiastical superiors, had beenpreparing himself for a great oratorical effort, and the historic cathedral wasfilled with a monster congregation. Amid a profound silence he began hisdiscourse, of which the following paragraphs are sufficient for our purpose: \"A portentous word has been pronounced against us to confront progress withChristianity--SCIENCE. Such is the formidable evocation with which they try toappall us. To all that we can say to base progress upon Christianity, they havealways a ready response: that is not scientific. We say revelation; revelationis not scientific. We say miracle; a miracle is not scientific. \"Thus antichristianism, faithful to its tradition, and now more than ever,pretends to kill us by science. Principle of darkness, it threatens us withlight. It proclaims itself the light. . . . \"A hundred times I asked myself, What is, then, that terrible science which ismaking ready to devour us? . . . Is it mathematical science? . . . but we alsohave our mathematicians. Is it physics? Astronomy? Physiology? Geology? But wenumber in Catholicism astronomers, physicists, geologists, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu009.htm#fn_497] and physiologists, whomake somewhat of a figure in the scientific world, who have their place in theAcademy and their name in history. It would appear that what is to crush us isneither this nor that science, but science in general. \"And why do they prophesy the overthrow of Christianity by science? Listen: . .. we must perish by science because we teach mysteries, and because theChristian mysteries are in radical antagonism with modern science. . . . Mysteryis the negation of common sense; science repels it; science condemns it; she hasspoken--Anathema! \"Ah! you are right; if Christian mystery is what you proclaim it, then in thename of science hurl the anathema at it. Nothing is antipathetic to science likethe absurd and contradictory. But, glory be to the truth! such is not themystery of Christianity. If it were so, it would remain for you to explain themost inexplicable of mysteries: how comes it that, during nearly 2,000 years, somany superior minds and rare geniuses have embraced our mysteries, withoutthinking to repudiate science or abdicate reason? * Talk as much as you like ofyour modern science, modern thought, and modern genius, there were scientistsbefore 1789. \"If our mysteries are so manifestly absurd and contradictory, how is it thatsuch mighty geniuses should have accepted them without a single doubt? . . . ButGod preserve me from insisting upon demonstrating that mystery implies nocontradiction with science! . . . Of what use to prove, by metaphysicalabstractions, that science can reconcile itself with mystery, when all therealities of creation show unanswerably that mystery everywhere baffles science?You ask that we should show you, beyond doubt, that exact science cannot admitmystery; I answer you decidedly that she cannot escape it. Mystery is theFATALITY of science. \"Shall we choose our proofs? First, then, look around at the purely materialworld, from the smallest atom to the most majestic sun. There, if you try toembrace in the unity of a single law all these bodies and their movements, ifyou seek the word which explains, in this vast panorama of the universe, thisprodigious harmony, where all seems to obey the empire of a single force, youpronounce a word to express it, and say Attraction! . . . Yes, attraction, thisis the sublime epitome of the science of the heavenly bodies. You say thatthroughout space these bodies recognize and attract each other; you say thatthey attract in proportion to their mass, and in inverse ratio with the squaresof their distances. And, in fact, until the present moment, nothing has happenedto give the lie to this assertion, but everything has confirmed a formula whichnow reigns sovereign in the EMPIRE OF HYPOTHESIS, and therefore it musthenceforth enjoy the glory of being an invincible truism. \"Gentlemen, with all my heart I make my scientific obeisances to the sovereigntyof attraction. It is not I who would desire to obscure a light in the world ofmatter which reflects upon the world of spirits. The empire of attraction, then,is palpable; it is sovereign; it stares us in the face! \"But, what is this attraction? who has seen attraction? who has met attraction?who has touched attraction? How do these mute bodies, intelligent, insensible,exercise upon each other unconsciously this reciprocity of action and reactionwhich holds them in a common equilibrium and unanimous harmony? Is this forcewhich draws sun to sun, and atom to atom, an invisible mediator which goes fromone to another? And, in such case what is this mediator? whence comes to itselfthis force which mediates, and this power which embraces, from which the sun canno more escape than the atom. But is this force nothing different from theelements themselves which attract each other? . . . Mystery! Mystery! \"Yes, gentlemen, this attraction which shines with such brightness throughoutthe material world, remains to you at bottom an impenetrable mystery. . . .Well! because of its mystery, will you deny its reality, which touches you, andits domination, which subjugates you? . . . And again, remark if you please,mystery is so much at the foundation of all science that if you should desire toexclude mystery, you would be compelled to suppress science itself. Imaginewhatever science you will, follow the magnificent sweep of its deductions . . .when you arrive at its parent source, you come face to face with the unknown. * \"Who has been able to penetrate the secret of the formation of a body, thegeneration of a single atom? What is there I will not say at the centre of asun, but at the centre of an atom? who has sounded to the bottom the abyss in agrain of sand? The grain of sand, gentlemen, has been studied four thousandyears by science, she has turned and returned it; she divides it and subdividesit; she torments it with her experiments; she vexes it with her questions tosnatch from it the final word as to its secret constitution; she asks it, withan insatiable curiosity: 'Shall I divide thee infinitesimally?' Then, suspendedover this abyss, science hesitates, she stumbles, she feels dazzled, she becomesdizzy, and, in despair says: I DO NOT KNOW! \"But if you are so fatally ignorant of the genesis and hidden nature of a grainof sand, how should you have an intuition as to the generation of a singleliving being? Whence in the living being does life come? Where does it commence?What is the life-principle?\" ** Can the scientists answer the eloquent monk? Can they escape from his pitilesslogic? Mystery certainly does bound them on every side; and the Ultima Thule,whether of Herbert Spencer, Tyndall, or Huxley, has written upon the closedportals the words INCOMPREHENSIBLE, UNKNOWABLE. For the lover of metaphor,science may be likened to a twinkling star shining with resplendent brightnessthrough rifts in a bank of densely-black clouds. If her votaries cannot definethat mysterious attraction which draws into concrete masses the materialparticles which form the smallest pebble on the ocean-beach, how can they definethe limits at which the possible stops and the impossible begins? Why should there be an attraction between the molecules of matter, and nonebetween those of spirit? If, out of the material portion of the ether, by virtueof the inherent restlessness of its particles, the forms of worlds and theirspecies of plants and animals can be evolved, why, out of the spiritual part ofthe ether, should not successive races of beings, from the stage of monad tothat of man, be developed; each lower form unfolding a higher one until the workof evolution is completed on our earth, in the production of immortal man? Itwill be seen that, for the moment, we entirely put aside the accumulated factswhich prove the case, and submit it to the arbitrament of logic. By whatsoever name the physicists may call the energizing principle in matter isof no account; it is a subtile something apart from the matter itself, and, asit escapes their detection, it must be something besides matter. If the law ofattraction is admitted as governing the one, why should it be excluded frominfluencing the other? Leaving logic to answer, we turn to the common experienceof mankind, and there find a mass of testimony corroborative of the immortalityof the soul, if we judge but from analogies. But we have more than that--we havethe unimpeachable testimony of thousands upon thousands, that there is a regularscience of the soul, which, notwithstanding that it is now denied the right of aplace among other sciences, is a science. This science, by penetrating thearcana of nature far deeper than our modern philosophy ever dreamed possible,teaches us how to force the invisible to become visible; the existence ofelementary spirits; the nature and magical properties of the astral light; thepower of living men to bring themselves into communication with the formerthrough the latter. Let them examine the proofs with the lamp of experience, andneither the Academy nor the Church, for which Father Felix so persuasivelyspoke, can deny them. Modern science is in a dilemma; it must concede our hypothesis to be correct, oradmit the possibility of miracle. To do so, is to say that there can be aninfraction of natural law. If this can happen in one case, what assurance havewe that it may not be repeated indefinitely, and so destroy that fixity of law,that perfect balance of forces by which the universe is governed. This is a veryancient and an unanswerable argument. To deny the appearance, in our midst, ofsupersensual beings, when they have been seen, at various times and in variouscountries, by not merely thousands, but millions of persons, is unpardonableobstinacy; to say that, in any one instance, the apparition has been produced bya miracle, fatal to the fundamental principle of science. What will they do?What can they do, when they shall have awakened from the benumbing stupor oftheir pride, but collect the facts, and try to enlarge the boundaries of theirfield of investigations? The existence of spirit in the common mediator, the ether, is denied bymaterialism; while theology makes of it a personal god, the kabalist holds thatboth are wrong, saving that in ether, the elements represent but matter--theblind cosmic forces of nature; and Spirit, the intelligence which directs them.The Hermetic, Orphic, and Pythagorean cosmogonical doctrines, as well as thoseof Sanchoniathon and Berosus, are all based upon one irrefutable formula, viz.:that the ether and chaos, or, in the Platonic language, mind and matter, werethe two primeval and eternal principles of the universe, utterly independent ofanything else. The former was the all-vivifying intellectual principle; thechaos, a shapeless, liquid principle, without \"form or sense,\" from the union ofwhich two, sprang into existence the universe, or rather, the universal world,the first androgynous deity--the chaotic matter becoming its body, and ether thesoul. According to the phraseology of a Fragment of Hermias, \"chaos, from thisunion with spirit, obtaining sense, shone with pleasure, and thus was producedthe Protogonos (the first-born) light.\" * This is the universal trinity, basedon the metaphysical conceptions of the ancients, who, reasoning by analogy, madeof man, who is a compound of intellect and matter, the microcosm of themacrocosm, or great universe. If we now compare this doctrine with the speculations of science, which comes toa full stop at the Borderland of the unknown, and, while incompetent to solvethe mystery, will allow no one else to speculate upon the subject; or, with thegreat theological dogma, that the world was called into existence by a heavenlytrick of prestidigitation; we do not hesitate to believe that, in the absence ofbetter proof, the Hermetic doctrine is by far the more reasonable, highlymetaphysical as it may appear. The universe is there, and we know that we exist;but how did it come, and how did we appear in it? Denied an answer by therepresentatives of physical learning, and excommunicated and anathematized forour blasphemous curiosity by the spiritual usurpers, what can we do, but turnfor information to the sages who meditated upon the subject ages before themolecules of our philosophers aggregated in ethereal space? This visible universe of spirit and matter, they say, is but the concrete imageof the ideal abstraction; it was built on the model of the first divine IDEA.Thus our universe existed from eternity in a latent state. The soul animatingthis purely spiritual universe is the central sun, the highest deity itself. Itwas not himself who built the concrete form of his idea, but his first-begotten;and as it was constructed on the geometrical figure of the dodecahedron,* thefirst-begotten \"was pleased to employ twelve thousand years in its creation.\"The latter number is expressed in the Tyrrhenian cosmogony, ** which shows mancreated in the sixth millennium. This agrees with the Egyptian theory of 6,000\"years,\" *** and with the Hebrew computation. Sanchoniathon, **** in hisCosmogony, declares that when the wind (spirit) became enamored of its ownprinciples (the chaos), an intimate union took place, which connection wascalled pothos, and from this sprang the seed of all. And the chaos knew not itsown production, for it was senseless; but from its embrace with the wind wasgenerated mot, or the ilus (mud). ***** From this proceeded the spores ofcreation and the generation of the universe. The ancients, who named but four elements, made of aether a fifth one. Onaccount of its essence being made divine by the unseen presence it wasconsidered as a medium between this world and the next. They held that when thedirecting intelligences retired from any portion of ether, one of the fourkingdoms which they are bound to superintend, the space was left in possessionof evil. An adept who prepared to converse with the \"invisibles,\" had to knowwell his ritual, and be perfectly acquainted with the conditions required forthe perfect equilibrium of the four elements in the astral light. First of all,he must purify the essence, and within the circle in which he sought to attractthe pure spirits, equilibrize the elements, so as to prevent the ingress of theelementaries into their respective spheres. But woe to the imprudent inquirerwho ignorantly trespasses upon forbidden ground; danger will beset him at everystep. He evokes powers that he cannot control; he arouses sentries which allowonly their masters to pass. For, in the words of the immortal Rosicrucian, \"Oncethat thou hast resolved to become a cooperator with the spirit of the livingGod, take care not to hinder Him in His work; for, if thy heat exceeds thenatural proportion thou hast stirr'd the wrath of the Moyst * natures, and theywill stand up against the central fire, and the central fire against them, andthere will be a terrible division in the chaos.\" ** The spirit of harmony andunion will depart from the elements, disturbed by the imprudent hand; and thecurrents of blind forces will become immediately infested by numberlesscreatures of matter and instinct--the bad daemons of the theurgists, the devilsof theology; the gnomes, salamanders, sylphs, and undines will assail the rashperformer under multifarious aerial forms. Unable to invent anything, they willsearch your memory to its very depths; hence the nervous exhaustion and mentaloppression of certain sensitive natures at spiritual circles. The elementalswill bring to light long-forgotten remembrances of the past; forms, images,sweet mementos, and familiar sentences, long since faded from our ownremembrance, but vividly preserved in the inscrutable depths of our memory andon the astral tablets of the imperishable \"BOOK OF LIFE.\" Every organized thing in this world, visible as well as invisible, has anelement appropriate to itself. The fish lives and breathes in the water; theplant consumes carbonic acid, which for animals and men produces death; somebeings are fitted for rarefied strata of air, others exist only in the densest.Life, to some, is dependent on sunlight, to others, upon darkness; and so thewise economy of nature adapts to each existing condition some living form. Theseanalogies warrant the conclusion that, not only is there no unoccupied portionof universal nature, but also that for each thing that has life, specialconditions are furnished, and, being furnished, they are necessary. Now,assuming that there is an invisible side to the universe, the fixed habit ofnature warrants the conclusion that this half is occupied, like the other half;and that each group of its occupants is supplied with the indispensableconditions of existence. It is as illogical to imagine that identical conditionsare furnished to all, as it would be to maintain such a theory respecting theinhabitants of the domain of visible nature. That there are spirits implies thatthere is a diversity of spirits; for men differ, and human spirits are butdisembodied men. To say that all spirits are alike, or fitted to the same atmosphere, orpossessed of like powers, or governed by the same attractions--electric,magnetic, odic, astral, it matters not which--is as absurd as though one shouldsay that all planets have the same nature, or that all animals are amphibious,or all men can be nourished on the same food. It accords with reason to supposethat the grossest natures among the spirits will sink to the lowest depths ofthe spiritual atmosphere--in other words, be found nearest to the earth.Inversely, the purest would be farthest away. In what, were we to coin a word,we should call the Psychomatics of Occultism, it is as unwarrantable to assumethat either of these grades of spirits can occupy the place, or subsist in theconditions, of the other, as in hydraulics it would be to expect that twoliquids of different densities could exchange their markings on the scale ofBeaume's hydrometer. Gorres, describing a conversation he had with some Hindus of the Malabar coast,reports that upon asking them whether they had ghosts among them, they replied,\"Yes, but we know them to be bad spirits . . . good ones can hardly ever appearat all. They are principally the spirits of suicides and murderers, or of thosewho die violent deaths. They constantly flutter about and appear as phantoms.Night-time is favorable to them, they seduce the feeble-minded and tempt othersin a thousand different ways.\" * Porphyry presents to us some hideous facts whose verity is substantiated in theexperience of every student of magic. \"The soul,\" ** says he, \"having even afterdeath a certain affection for its body, an affinity proportioned to the violencewith which their union was broken, we see many spirits hovering in despair abouttheir earthly remains; we even see them eagerly seeking the putrid remains ofother bodies, but above all freshly-spilled blood, which seems to impart to themfor the moment some of the faculties of life.\" *** Let spiritualists who doubt the theurgist, try the effect of about half a poundof freshly-drawn human blood at their next materializing seance! \"The gods and the angels,\" says Iamblichus, \"appear to us among peace andharmony; the bad demons, in tossing everything in confusion. . . . As to theordinary souls, we can perceive them more rarely, etc.\" * \"The human soul (the astral body) is a demon that our language may name genius,\"says Apuleius. ** \"She is an immortal god, though in a certain sense she is bornat the same time as the man in whom she is. Consequently, we may say that shedies in the same way that she is born.\" \"The soul is born in this world upon leaving another world (anima mundi), inwhich her existence precedes the one we all know (on earth). Thus, the gods whoconsider her proceedings in all the phases of various existences and as a whole,punish her sometimes for sins committed during an anterior life. She dies whenshe separates herself from a body in which she crossed this life as in a frailbark. And this is, if I mistake not, the secret meaning of the tumularyinscription, so simple for the initiate: \"To the gods manes who lived.\" But thiskind of death does not annihilate the soul, it only transforms it into a lemure.Lemures are the manes or ghosts, which we know under the name of lares. Whenthey keep away and show us a beneficient protection, we honor in them theprotecting divinities of the family hearth; but, if their crimes sentence themto err, we call them larvae. They become a plague for the wicked, and the vainterror of the good.\" This language can hardly be called ambiguous, and yet, the Reincarnationistsquote Apuleius in corroboration of their theory that man passes through asuccession of physical human births upon this planet, until he is finally purgedfrom the dross of his nature. But Apuleius distinctly says that we come uponthis earth from another one, where we had an existence, the recollection ofwhich has faded away. As the watch passes from hand to hand and room to room ina factory, one part being added here and another there, until the delicatemachine is perfected, according to the design conceived in the mind of themaster before the work was begun; so, according to ancient philosophy, the firstdivine conception of man takes shape little by little, in the severaldepartments of the universal workshop, and the perfect human being finallyappears on our scene. This philosophy teaches that nature never leaves her work unfinished; if baffledat the first attempt, she tries again. When she evolves a human embryo, theintention is that a man shall be perfected--physically, intellectually, andspiritually. His body is to grow mature, wear out, and die; his mind unfold,ripen, and be harmoniously balanced; his divine spirit illuminate and blendeasily with the inner man. No human being completes its grand cycle, or the\"circle of necessity,\" until all these are accomplished. As the laggards in arace struggle and plod in their first quarter while the victor darts past thegoal, so, in the race of immortality, some souls outspeed all the rest and reachthe end, while their myriad competitors are toiling under the load of matter,close to the startingpoint. Some unfortunates fall out entirely, and lose allchance of the prize; some retrace their steps and begin again. This is what theHindu dreads above all things--transmigration and reincarnation; only on otherand inferior planets, never on this one. But there is a way to avoid it, andBuddha taught it in his doctrine of poverty, restriction of the senses, perfectindifference to the objects of this earthly vale of tears, freedom from passion,and frequent intercommunication with the Atma--soul-contemplation. The cause ofreincarnation is ignorance of our senses, and the idea that there is any realityin the world, anything except abstract existence. From the organs of sense comesthe \"hallucination\" we call contact; \"from contact, desire; from desire,sensation (which also is a deception of our body); from sensation, the cleavingto existing bodies; from this cleaving, reproduction; and from reproduction,disease, decay, and death.\" Thus, like the revolutions of a wheel, there is a regular succession of deathand birth, the moral cause of which is the cleaving to existing objects, whilethe instrumental cause is karma (the power which controls the universe,prompting it to activity), merit and demerit. \"It is, therefore, the greatdesire of all beings who would be released from the sorrows of successive birth,to seek the destruction of the moral cause, the cleaving to existing objects, orevil desire.\" They, in whom evil desire is entirely destroyed, are calledArhats. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu009.htm#fn_514] Freedom fromevil desire insures the possession of a miraculous power. At his death, theArhat is never reincarnated; he invariably attains Nirvana--a word, by the bye,falsely interpreted by the Christian scholars and skeptical commentators.Nirvana is the world of cause, in which all deceptive effects or delusions ofour senses disappear. Nirvana is the highest attainable sphere. The pitris (thepre-Adamic spirits) are considered as reincarnated, by the Buddhisticphilosopher, though in a degree far superior to that of the man of earth. Dothey not die in their turn? Do not their astral bodies suffer and rejoice, andfeel the same curse of illusionary feelings as when embodied? What Buddha taught in the sixth century, B.C., in India, Pythagoras taught inthe fifth, in Greece and Italy. Gibbon shows how deeply the Pharisees wereimpressed with this belief in the transmigration of souls. * The Egyptian circleof necessity is ineffaceably stamped on the hoary monuments of old. And Jesus,when healing the sick, invariably used the following expression: \"Thy sins areforgiven thee.\" This is a pure Buddhistical doctrine. \"The Jews said to theblind man: Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? Thedoctrine of the disciples (of Christ) is analogous to the 'Merit and Demerit' ofthe Buddhists; for the sick recovered, if their sins were forgiven.\" ** But,this former life believed in by the Buddhists, is not a life on this planet,for, more than any other people, the Buddhistical philosopher appreciated thegreat doctrine of cycles. The speculations of Dupuis, Volney, and Godfrey Higgins on the secret meaning ofthe cycles, or the kalpas and the yugs of the Brahmans and Buddhists, amountedto little, as they did not have the key to the esoteric, spiritual doctrinetherein contained. No philosophy ever speculated on God as an abstraction, butconsidered Him under His various manifestations. The \"First Cause\" of the HebrewBible, the Pythagorean \"Monad,\" the \"One Existence\" of the Hindu philosopher,and the kabalistic \"En-Soph\"--the Boundless--are identical. The Hindu Bhagavantdoes not create; he enters the egg of the world, and emanates from it as Brahm,in the same manner as the Pythagorean Duad evolves from the highest and solitaryMonas. *** The Monas of the Samian philosopher is the Hindu Monas (mind), \"whohas no first cause (apurva, or material cause), nor is liable to destruction.\" *Brahma, as Prajapati, manifests himself first of all as \"twelve bodies,\" orattributes, which are represented by the twelve gods, symbolizing 1, Fire; 2,the Sun; 3, Soma, which gives omniscience; 4, all living Beings; 5, Vayu, ormaterial Ether; 6, Death, or breath of destruction--Siva; 7, Earth; 8, Heaven;9, Agni, the Immaterial Fire; 10, Aditya, the immaterial and female invisibleSun; 11, Mind; 12, the great Infinite Cycle, \"which is not to be stopped.\" **After that, Brahma dissolves himself into the Visible Universe, every atom ofwhich is himself. When this is done, the not-manifested, indivisible, andindefinite Monas retires into the undisturbed and majestic solitude of itsunity. The manifested deity, a duad at first, now becomes a triad; its triunequality emanates incessantly spiritual powers, who become immortal gods (souls).Each of these souls must be united in its turn with a human being, and from themoment of its consciousness it commences a series of births and deaths. AnEastern artist has attempted to give pictorial expression to the kabalisticdoctrine of the cycles. The picture covers a whole inner wall of a subterraneantemple in the neighborhood of a great Buddhistic pagoda, and is strikinglysuggestive. Let us attempt to convey some idea of the design, as we recall it. Imagine a given point in space as the primordial one; then with compasses draw acircle around this point; where the beginning and the end unite together,emanation and reabsorption meet. The circle itself is composed of innumerablesmaller circles, like the rings of a bracelet, and each of these minor ringsforms the belt of the goddess which represents that sphere. As the curve of thearc approaches the ultimate point of the semi-circle--the nadir of the grandcycle--at which is placed our planet by the mystical painter, the face of eachsuccessive goddess becomes more dark and hideous than European imagination isable to conceive. Every belt is covered with the representations of plants,animals, and human beings, belonging to the fauna, flora, and anthropology ofthat particular sphere. There is a certain distance between each of the spheres,purposely marked; for, after the accomplishment of the circles through varioustransmigrations, the soul is allowed a time of temporary nirvana, during whichspace of time the atma loses all remembrance of past sorrows. The intermediateethereal space is filled with strange beings. Those between the highest etherand the earth below are the creatures of a \"middle nature\"; nature-spirits, or,as the kabalists term it sometimes, the elementary. This picture is either a copy of the one described to posterity by Berosus, thepriest of the temple of Belus, at Babylon, or the original. We leave it to theshrewdness of the modern archaeologist to decide. But the wall is covered withprecisely such creatures as described by the semi-demon, or half-god, Oannes,the Chaldean man-fish, * \" . . . hideous beings, which were produced of atwo-fold principle\"--the astral light and the grosser matter. Even remains of architectural relics of the earliest races have been sadlyneglected by antiquarians, until now. The caverns of Ajunta, which are but 200miles from Bombay, in the Chandor range, and the ruins of the ancient city ofAurungabad, whose crumbling palaces and curious tombs have lain in desolatesolitude for many centuries, have attracted attention but very recently.Mementos of long by-gone civilization, they were allowed to become the shelterof wild beasts for ages before they were found worthy of a scientificexploration, and it is only recently that the Observer gave an enthusiasticdescription of these archaic ancestors of Herculaneum and Pompeii. After justlyblaming the local government which \"has provided a bungalow where the travellermay find shelter and safety, but that is all,\" it proceeds to narrate thewonders to be seen in this retired spot, in the following words: \"In a deep glen away up the mountain there is a group of cave-temples which arethe most wonderful caverns on the earth. It is not known at the present age howmany of these exist in the deep recesses of the mountains; but twenty-seven havebeen explored, surveyed, and, to some extent, cleared of rubbish. There are,doubtless, many others. It is hard to realize with what indefatigable toil thesewonderful caves have been hewn from the solid rock of amygdaloid. They are saidto have been wholly Buddhist in their origin, and were used for purposes ofworship and asceticism. They rank very high as works of art. They extend over500 feet along a high cliff, and are carved in the most curious manner,exhibiting, in a wonderful degree, the taste, talent, and persevering industryof the Hindu sculptors. \"These cave-temples are beautifully cut and carved on the outside; but insidethey were finished most elaborately, and decorated with a vast profusion ofsculptures and paintings. These long-deserted temples have suffered fromdampness and neglect, and the paintings and frescos are not what they werehundreds of years ago. But the colors are still brilliant, and scenes gay andfestive still appear upon the walls. Some of the figures cut in the rock aretaken for marriage-processions and scenes in domestic life that are representedas joyful. The female figures are beautiful, delicate, and fair as Europeans.Every one of these representations is artistic, and all of them are unpollutedby any grossness or obscenity generally so prominent in Brahmanicalrepresentations of a similar character. \"These caves are visited by a great number of antiquarians, who are striving todecipher the hieroglyphics inscribed on the walls and determine the age of thesecurious temples. \"The ruins of the ancient city of Aurungabad are not very far from these caves.It was a walled city of great repute, but is now deserted. There are not onlybroken walls, but crumbling palaces. They were built of immense strength, andsome of the walls appear as solid as the everlasting hills. \"There are a great many places in this vicinity where there are Hindu remains,consisting of deep caves and rock-cut temples. Many of these temples aresurrounded by a circular enclosure, which is often adorned with statues andcolumns. The figure of an elephant is very common, placed before or beside theopening of a temple, as a sort of sentinel. Hundreds and thousands of niches arebeautifully cut in the solid rock, and when these temples were thronged withworshippers, each niche had a statue or image, usually in the florid style ofthese Oriental sculptures. It is a sad truth that almost every image here isshamefully defaced and mutilated. It is often said that no Hindu will bow downto an imperfect image, and that the Mahometans, knowing this, purposelymutilated all these images to prevent the Hindus from worshipping them. This isregarded by the Hindus as sacrilegious and blasphemous, awakening the keenestanimosities, which every Hindu inherits from his father, and which centurieshave not been able to efface. \"Here also are the remains of buried cities--sad ruins--generally without asingle inhabitant. In the grand palaces where royalty once gathered and heldfestivals, wild beasts find their hiding-places. In several places the track ofthe railway has been constructed over or through these ruins, and the materialhas been used for the bed of the road. . . . Enormous stones have remained intheir places for thousands of years, and probably will for thousands of years tocome. These rock-cut temples, as well as these mutilated statues, show aworkmanship that no work now being done by the natives can equal. * It is veryevident that hundreds of years since these hills were alive with a vastmultitude, where now it is all utter desolation, without cultivation orinhabitants, and given over to wild beasts. \"It is good hunting ground, and, as the English are mighty hunters, they mayprefer to have these mountains and ruins remain without change.\" We fervently hope they will. Enough vandalism was perpetrated in earlier ages topermit us the hope that at least in this century of exploration and learning,science, in its branches of archaeology and philology, will not be deprived ofthese most precious records, wrought on imperishable tablets of granite androck. We will now present a few fragments of this mysterious doctrine ofreincarnation--as distinct from metempsychosis--which we have from an authority.Reincarnation, i.e., the appearance of the same individual, or rather of hisastral monad, twice on the same planet, is not a rule in nature; it is anexception, like the teratological phenomenon of a two-headed infant. It ispreceded by a violation of the laws of harmony of nature, and happens only whenthe latter, seeking to restore its disturbed equilibrium, violently throws backinto earth-life the astral monad which had been tossed out of the circle ofnecessity by crime or accident. Thus, in cases of abortion, of infants dyingbefore a certain age, and of congenital and incurable idiocy, nature's originaldesign to produce a perfect human being, has been interrupted. Therefore, whilethe gross matter of each of these several entities is suffered to disperseitself at death, through the vast realm of being, the immortal spirit and astralmonad of the individual--the latter having been set apart to animate a frame andthe former to shed its divine light on the corporeal organization--must try asecond time to carry out the purpose of the creative intelligence. If reason has been so far developed as to become active and discriminative,there is no reincarnation on this earth, for the three parts of the triune manhave been united together, and he is capable of running the race. But when thenew being has not passed beyond the condition of monad, or when, as in theidiot, the trinity has not been completed, the immortal spark which illuminatesit, has to reenter on the earthly plane as it was frustrated in its firstattempt. Otherwise, the mortal or astral, and the immortal or divine, souls,could not progress in unison and pass onward to the sphere above. Spirit followsa line parallel with that of matter; and the spiritual evolution goes hand inhand with the physical. As in the case exemplified by Professor Le Conte (videchap. ix.), \"there is no force in nature\"--and the rule applies to the spiritualas well as to the physical evolution--\"which is capable of raising at oncespirit or matter from No. 1 to No. 3, or from 2 to 4, without stopping andreceiving an accession of force of a different kind on the intermediate plane.\"That is to say, the monad which was imprisoned in the elementary being--therudimentary or lowest astral form of the future man--after having passed throughand quitted the highest physical shape of a dumb animal--say an orang-outang, oragain an elephant, one of the most intellectual of brutes--that monad, we say,cannot skip over the physical and intellectual sphere of the terrestrial man,and be suddenly ushered into the spiritual sphere above. What reward orpunishment can there be in that sphere of disembodied human entities for afoetus or a human embryo which had not even time to breathe on this earth, stillless an opportunity to exercise the divine faculties of the spirit? Or, for anirresponsible infant, whose senseless monad remaining dormant within the astraland physical casket, could as little prevent him from burning himself as anotherperson to death? Or for one idiotic from birth, the number of whose cerebralcircumvolutions is only from twenty to thirty per cent of those of sanepersons; * and who therefore is irresponsible for either his disposition, acts,or the imperfections of his vagrant, half-developed intellect? No need to remark that if even hypothetical, this theory is no more ridiculousthan many others considered as strictly orthodox. We must not forget that eitherthrough the inaptness of the specialists or some other reason, physiology itselfis the least advanced or understood of sciences, and that some Frenchphysicians, with Dr. Fournie, positively despair of ever progressing in itbeyond pure hypotheses. Further, the same occult doctrine recognizes another possibility; albeit so rareand so vague that it is really useless to mention it. Even the modern Occidentaloccultists deny it, though it is universally accepted in Eastern countries.When, through vice, fearful crimes and animal passions, a disembodied spirit hasfallen to the eighth sphere--the allegorical Hades, and the gehenna of theBible--the nearest to our earth--he can, with the help of that glimpse of reasonand consciousness left to him, repent; that is to say, he can, by exercising theremnants of his will-power, strive upward, and like a drowning man, struggleonce more to the surface. In the Magical and Philosophical Precepts of Psellus,we find one which, warning mankind, says: \"Stoop not down, for a precipice lies below the earth,Drawing under a descent of SEVEN steps, beneath whichIs the throne of dire necessity.\" *A strong aspiration to retrieve his calamities, a pronounced desire, will drawhim once more into the earth's atmosphere. Here he will wander and suffer moreor less in dreary solitude. His instincts will make him seek with aviditycontact with living persons. . . . These spirits are the invisible but tootangible magnetic vampires; the subjective daemons so well known to mediaevalecstatics, nuns, and monks, to the \"witches\" made so famous in the Witch-Hammer;and to certain sensitive clairvoyants, according to their own confessions. Theyare the blood-daemons of Porphyry, the larvae and lemures of the ancients; thefiendish instruments which sent so many unfortunate and weak victims to the rackand stake. Origen held all the daemons which possessed the demoniacs mentionedin the New Testament to be human \"spirits.\" It is because Moses knew so wellwhat they were, and how terrible were the consequences to weak persons whoyielded to their influence, that he enacted the cruel, murderous law againstsuch would-be \"witches\"; but Jesus, full of justice and divine love to humanity,healed instead of killing them. Subsequently our clergy, the pretended exemplarsof Christian principles, followed the law of Moses, and quietly ignored the lawof Him whom they call their \"one living God,\" by burning dozens of thousands ofsuch pretended \"witches.\" Witch! mighty name, which in the past contained the promise of ignominiousdeath; and in the present has but to be pronounced to raise a whirlwind ofridicule, a tornado of sarcasms! How is it then that there have always been menof intellect and learning, who never thought that it would disgrace theirreputation for learning, or lower their dignity, to publicly affirm thepossibility of such a thing as a \"witch,\" in the correct acceptation of theword. One such fearless champion was Henry More, the learned scholar ofCambridge, of the seventeenth century. It is well worth our while to see howcleverly he handled the question. It appears that about the year 1678, a certain divine, named John Webster, wroteCriticisms and Interpretations of Scripture, against the existence of witches,and other \"superstitions.\" Finding the work \"a weak and impertinent piece,\" Dr.More criticised it in a letter to Glanvil, the author of SadducismusTriumphatus, and as an appendix sent a treatise on witchcraft and explanationsof the word witch, itself. This document is very rare, but we possess it in afragmentary form in an old manuscript, having seen it mentioned besides only inan insignificant work of 1820, on Apparitions, for it appears that the documentitself was long since out of print. The words witch and wizard, according to Dr. More, signify no more than a wiseman or a wise woman. In the word wizard, it is plain at the very sight; and \"themost plain and least operose deduction of the name witch, is from wit, whosederived adjective might be wittigh or wittich, and by contraction, afterwardswitch; as the noun wit is from the verb to weet, which is, to know. So that awitch, thus far, is no more than a knowing woman; which answers exactly to theLatin word saga, according to that of Festus, sagae dictae anus quae multasciunt.\" This definition of the word appears to us the more plausible, as it exactlyanswers the evident meaning of the Slavonian-Russian names for witches andwizards. The former is called vyedma, and the latter vyedmak, both from the verbto know, vedat or vyedat; the root, moreover, being positively Sanscrit. \"Veda,\"says Max Muller, in his Lecture on the Vedas, \"means originally knowing, orknowledge. Veda is the same word which appears in Greek οιδα, I know [thedigamma, vau being omitted], and in the English wise, wisdom, to wit.\" *Furthermore, the Sanscrit word vidma, answering to the German wir wissen, meansliterally \"we know.\" It is a great pity that the eminent philologist, whilegiving in his lecture the Sanscrit, Greek, Gothic, Anglo-Saxon, and Germancomparative roots of this word, has neglected the Slavonian. Another Russian appellation for witch and wizard, the former being purelySlavonian, is znahar and znaharka (feminine) from the same verb znat to know.Thus Dr. More's definition of the word, given in 1678, is perfectly correct, andcoincides in every particular with modern philology. \"Use,\" says this scholar, \"questionless had appropriated the word to such a kindof skill and knowledge as was out of the common road or extraordinary. Nor didthis peculiarity imply any unlawfulness. But there was after a furtherrestriction, in which alone now-a-days the words witch and wizard are used. Andthat is, for one that has the knowledge and skill of doing or telling things inan extraordinary way, and that in virtue of either an express or implicitsociation or confederacy with some bad spirits.\" In the clause of the severe lawof Moses, so many names are reckoned up with that of witch, that it is difficultas well as useless to give here the definition of every one of them as found inDr.More's able treatise. \"There shall not be found among you any one that usethdivination, or an observer of time, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer,or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer,\" says thetext. We will show, further on, the real object of such severity. For thepresent, we will remark that Dr. More, after giving a learned definition ofevery one of such appellations, and showing the value of their real meaning inthe days of Moses, proves that there is a vast difference between the\"enchanters,\" \"observers of time,\" etc., and a witch. \"So many names arereckoned up in this prohibition of Moses, that, as in our common law, the sensemay be more sure, and leave no room to evasion. And that the name of 'witch' isnot from any tricks of legerdemain as in common jugglers, that delude the sightof the people at a market or fair, but that it is the name of such as raisemagical spectres to deceive men's sight, and so are most certainlywitches--women and men who have a bad spirit in them. 'Thou shalt not suffer'מכשפה mecassephah, that is, 'a witch, to live.' Which would be a law of extremeseverity, or rather cruelty, against a poor hocus-pocus for his tricks oflegerdemain.\" Thus, it is but the sixth appellation, that of a consulter with familiar spiritsor a witch, that had to incur the greatest penalty of the law of Moses, for itis only a witch which must not be suffered to live, while all the others aresimply enumerated as such with whom the people of Israel were forbidden tocommunicate on account of their idolatry or rather religious views and learningchiefly. This sixth word is שיאל אוב, shoel aub, which our English translationrenders, \"a consulter with familiar spirits\"; but which the Septuaginttranslates, ενγαστριμυθος, one that has a familiar spirit inside him, onepossessed with the spirit of divination, which was considered to be Python bythe Greeks, and obh by the Hebrews, the old serpent; in its esoteric meaning thespirit of concupiscence and matter; which, according to the kabalists, is alwaysan elementary human spirit of the eighth sphere. \"Shoel obh, I conceive,\" says Henry More, \"is to be understood of the witchherself who asks counsel of her or his familiar. The reason of the name obh, wastaken first from that spirit that was in the body of the party, and swelled itto a protuberancy, the voice always seeming to come out as from a bottle, forwhich reason they were named ventriloquists. Ob signifies as much as Pytho,which at first took its name from the pythii vates, a spirit that tells hiddenthings, or things to come. In Acts xvi. 16, πνευμα πυθονος, when \"Paul beinggrieved, turned and said to that spirit, I command thee, in the name of JesusChrist, to come out of her, and he came out at the same hour.\" Therefore, thewords obsessed or possessed are synonyms of the word witch; nor could this pythoof the eighth sphere come out of her, unless it was a spirit distinct from her.And so it is that we see in Leviticus xx. 27: \"A man also or woman that hath afamiliar spirit, or that is a wizard (an irresponsible jidegnoni) shall surelybe put to death, they shall stone them with stones, their blood shall be uponthem.\" A cruel and unjust law beyond doubt, and one which gives the lie to a recentutterance of \"Spirits,\" by the mouth of one of the most popular inspirationalmediums of the day, to the effect that modern philological research proves thatthe Mosaic law never contemplated the killing of the poor \"mediums\" or witchesof the Old Testament, but that the words, \"thou shalt not suffer a witch tolive,\" meant to live by their mediumship, that is, to gain their livelihood! Aninterpretation no less ingenious than novel. Certainly, nowhere short of thesource of such inspiration could we find such philological profundity! * \"Shut the door in the face of the daemon,\" says the Kabala, \"and he will keeprunning away from you, as if you pursued him,\" which means, that you must notgive a hold on you to such spirits of obsession by attracting them into anatmosphere of congenial sin. These daemons seek to introduce themselves into the bodies of the simple-mindedand idiots, and remain there until dislodged therefrom by a powerful and purewill. Jesus, Apollonius, and some of the apostles, had the power to cast outdevils, by purifying the atmosphere within and without the patient, so as toforce the unwelcome tenant to flight. Certain volatile salts are particularlyobnoxious to them; and the effect of the chemicals used in a saucer, and placedunder the bed by Mr. Varley, of London, ** for the purpose of keeping away somedisagreeable physical phenomena at night, are corroborative of this great truth.Pure or even simply inoffensive human spirits fear nothing, for having ridthemselves of terrestrial matter, terrestrial compounds can affect them in nowise; such spirits are like a breath. Not so with the earth-bound souls and thenature-spirits. It is for these carnal terrestrial larvae, degraded human spirits, that theancient kabalists entertained a hope of reincarnation. But when, or how? At afitting moment, and if helped by a sincere desire for his amendment andrepentance by some strong, sympathizing person, or the will of an adept, or evena desire emanating from the erring spirit himself, provided it is powerfulenough to make him throw off the burden of sinful matter. Losing allconsciousness, the once bright monad is caught once more into the vortex of ourterrestrial evolution, and it repasses the subordinate kingdoms, and againbreathes as a living child. To compute the time necessary for the completion ofthis process would be impossible. Since there is no perception of time ineternity, the attempt would be a mere waste of labor. As we have said, but few kabalists believe in it, and this doctrine originatedwith certain astrologers. While casting up the nativities of certain historicalpersonages renowned for some peculiarities of disposition, they found theconjunction of the planets answering perfectly to remarkable oracles andprophesies about other persons born ages later. Observation, and what would nowbe termed \"remarkable coincidences,\" added to revelation during the \"sacredsleep\" of the neophyte, disclosed the dreadful truth. So horrible is the thoughtthat even those who ought to be convinced of it prefer ignoring it, or at leastavoid speaking on the subject. This way of obtaining oracles was practiced in the highest antiquity. In India,this sublime lethargy is called \"the sacred sleep of * * *\" It is an oblivioninto which the subject is thrown by certain magical processes, supplemented bydraughts of the juice of the soma. The body of the sleeper remains for severaldays in a condition resembling death, and by the power of the adept is purifiedof its earthliness and made fit to become the temporary receptacle of thebrightness of the immortal Augoeides. In this state the torpid body is made toreflect the glory of the upper spheres, as a burnished mirror does the rays ofthe sun. The sleeper takes no note of the lapse of time, but upon awakening,after four or five days of trance, imagines he has slept but a few moments. Whathis lips utter he will never know; but as it is the spirit which directs themthey can pronounce nothing but divine truth. For the time being the poorhelpless clod is made the shrine of the sacred presence, and converted into anoracle a thousand times more infallible than the asphyxiated Pythoness ofDelphi; and, unlike her mantic frenzy, which was exhibited before the multitude,this holy sleep is witnessed only within the sacred precinct by those few of theadepts who are worthy to stand in the presence of the ADONAI. The description which Isaiah gives of the purification necessary for a prophetto undergo before he is worthy to be the mouthpiece of heaven, applies to thecase in point. In customary metaphor he says: \"Then flew one of the seraphimunto me having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs fromoff the altar . . . and he laid it upon my mouth and said, Lo! this hath touchedthy lips and thine iniquity is taken away.\" The invocation of his own Augoeides, by the purified adept, is described inwords of unparalleled beauty by Bulwer-Lytton in Zanoni, and there he gives usto understand that the slightest touch of mortal passion unfits the hierophantto hold communion with his spotless soul. Not only are there few who cansuccessfully perform the ceremony, but even these rarely resort to it except forthe instruction of some neophytes, and to obtain knowledge of the most solemnimportance. And yet how little is the knowledge treasured up by these hierophants understoodor appreciated by the general public! \"There is another collection of writingsand traditions bearing the title of Kabala, attributed to Oriental scholars,\"says the author of Art-Magic; \"but as this remarkable work is of little or novalue without a key, which can only be furnished by Oriental fraternities, itstranscript would be of no value to the general reader.\" * And how they areridiculed by every Houndsditch commercial traveller who wanders through India inpursuit of \"orders\" and writes to the Times, and misrepresented by everynimble-fingered trickster who pretends to show by legerdemain, to the gapingcrowd, the feats of true Oriental magicians! But, notwithstanding his unfairness in the Algerian affair, Robert Houdin, anauthority on the art of prestidigitation, and Moreau-Cinti, another, gave honesttestimony in behalf of the French mediums. They both testified, whencross-examined by the Academicians, that none but the \"mediums\" could possiblyproduce the phenomena of table-rapping and levitation without a suitablepreparation and furniture adapted for the purpose. They also showed that theso-called \"levitations without contact\" were feats utterly beyond the power ofthe professional juggler; that for them, such levitations, unless produced in aroom supplied with secret machinery and concave mirrors, was impossible. Theyadded moreover, that the simple apparition of a diaphanous hand, in a place inwhich confederacy would be rendered impossible, the medium having beenpreviously searched, would be a demonstration that it was the work of no humanagency, whatever else that agency might be. The Siecle, and other Parisiannewspapers immediately published their suspicions that these two professionaland very clever gentlemen had become the confederates of the spiritists! Professor Pepper, director of the Polytechnic Institute of London, invented aclever apparatus to produce spiritual appearances on the stage, and sold hispatent in 1863, in Paris, for the sum of 20,000 francs. The phantoms looked realand were evanescent, being but an effect produced by the reflection of ahighly-illuminated object upon the surface of plateglass. They seemed to appearand disappear, to walk about the stage and play their parts to perfection.Sometimes one of the phantoms placed himself on a bench; after which, one of theliving actors would begin quarrelling with him, and, seizing a heavy hatchet,would part the head and body of the ghost in two. But, joining his two partsagain, the spectre would reappear, a few steps off, to the amazement of thepublic. The contrivance worked marvellously well, and nightly attracted largecrowds. But to produce these ghosts required a stage-apparatus, and more thanone confederate. There were nevertheless some reporters who made this exhibitionthe pretext for ridiculing the spiritists--as though the two classes ofphenomena had the slightest connection! What the Pepper ghosts pretended to do, genuine disembodied human spirits, whentheir reflection is materialized by the elementals, can actually perform. Theywill permit themselves to be perforated with bullets or the sword, or to bedismembered, and then instantly form themselves anew. But the case is differentwith both cosmic and human elementary spirits, for a sword or dagger, or even apointed stick, will cause them to vanish in terror. This will seem unaccountableto those who do not understand of what a material substance the elementary arecomposed; but the kabalists understand perfectly. The records of antiquity andof the middle ages, to say nothing of the modern wonders at Cideville, whichhave been judicially attested for us, corroborate these facts. Skeptics, and even skeptical spiritualists, have often unjustly accused mediumsof fraud, when denied what they considered their inalienable right to test thespirits. But where there is one such case, there are fifty in whichspiritualists have permitted themselves to be practiced upon by tricksters,while they neglected to appreciate genuine manifestations procured for them bytheir mediums. Ignorant of the laws of mediumship, such do not know that when anhonest medium is once taken possession of by spirits, whether disembodied orelemental, he is no longer his own master. He cannot control the actions of thespirits, nor even his own. They make him a puppet to dance at their pleasurewhile they pull the wires behind the scenes. The false medium may seementranced, and yet be playing tricks all the while; while the real medium mayappear to be in full possession of his senses, when in fact he is far away, andhis body is animated by his \"Indian guide,\" or \"control.\" Or, he may beentranced in his cabinet, while his astral body (double) or doppelganger, iswalking about the room moved by another intelligence. Among all the phenomena, that of re-percussion, closely allied with those ofbi-location and aerial \"travelling,\" is the most astounding. In the middle agesit was included under the head of sorcery. De Gasparin, in his refutations ofthe miraculous character of the marvels of Cideville, treats of the subject atlength; but these pretended explanations were all in their turn exploded by deMirville and des Mousseaux, who, while failing in their attempt to trace thephenomena back to the Devil, did, nevertheless, prove their spiritual origin. \"The prodigy of re-percussion,\" says des Mousseaux, \"occurs when a blow aimed atthe spirit, visible or otherwise, of an absent living person, or at the phantomwhich represents him, strikes this person himself, at the same time, and in thevery place at which the spectre or his double is touched! We must suppose,therefore, that the blow is re-percussed, and that it reaches, as if rebounding,from the image of the living person--his phantasmal * duplicate--the original,wherever he may be, in flesh and blood. \"Thus, for instance, an individual appears before me, or, remaining invisible,declares war, threatens, and causes me to be threatened with obsession. I strikeat the place where I perceive his phantom, where I hear him moving, where I feelsomebody, something which molests and resists me. I strike; the blood willappear sometimes on this place, and occasionally a scream may be heard; he iswounded--perhaps, dead! It is done, and I have explained the fact.\" ** \"Notwithstanding that, at the moment I struck him, his presence in another placeis authentically proved; . . . I saw--yes, I saw plainly the phantom hurt uponthe cheek or shoulder, and this same wound is found precisely on the livingperson, re-percussed upon his cheek or shoulder. Thus, it becomes evident thatthe facts of re-percussion have an intimate connection with those of bi-locationor duplication, either spiritual or corporeal.\" The history of the Salem witchcraft, as we find it recorded in the works ofCotton Mather, Calef, Upham, and others, furnishes a curious corroboration ofthe fact of the double, as it also does of the effects of allowing elementaryspirits to have their own way. This tragical chapter of American history hasnever yet been written in accordance with the truth. A party of four or fiveyoung girls had become \"developed\" as mediums, by sitting with a West Indiannegro woman, a practitioner of Obeah. They began to suffer all kinds of physicaltorture, such as pinching, having pins stuck in them, and the marks of bruisesand teeth on different parts of their bodies. They would declare that they werehurt by the spectres of various persons, and we learn from the celebratedNarrative of Deodat Lawson (London, 1704), that \"some of them confessed thatthey did afflict the sufferers (i.e., these young girls), according to the timeand manner they were accused thereof; and, being asked what they did to afflictthem, some said that they pricked pins into poppets, made with rags, wax, andother materials. One that confessed after the signing of her death-warrant, saidshe used to afflict them by clutching and pinching her hands together, andwishing in what part and after what manner she would have them afflicted, and itwas done.\" Mr. Upham * tells us that Abigail Hobbs, one of these girls, acknowledged thatshe had confederated with the Devil, who \"came to her in the shape of a man,\"and commanded her to afflict the girls, bringing images made of wood in theirlikeness, with thorns for her to prick into the images, which she did;whereupon, the girls cried out that they were hurt by her.\" How perfectly these facts, the validity of which was proven by unimpeachabletestimony in court, go to corroborate the doctrine of Paracelsus. It issurpassingly strange that so ripe a scholar as Mr. Upham should have accumulatedinto the 1,000 pages of his two volumes such a mass of legal evidence, going toshow the agency of earth-bound souls and tricksy nature-spirits in thesetragedies, without suspecting the truth. Ages ago, the old Ennius was made by Lucretius to say: \"Bis duo sunt homines, manes, caro, spiritus umbra;Quatuor ista loci bis duo suscipirent;Terra tegit carnem;--tumulum circumvolat umbra,Orcus habet manes.\"In this present case, as in every similar one, the scientists, being unable toexplain the fact, assert that it cannot exist. But we will now give a few historical instances going to show that some daimons,or elementary spirits, are afraid of sword, knife, or any thing sharp. We do notpretend to explain the reason. That is the province of physiology andpsychology. Unfortunately, physiologists have not yet been able to evenestablish the relations between speech and thought, and so, have handed it overto the metaphysicians, who, in their turn, according to Fournie, have donenothing. Done nothing, we say, but claimed everything. No fact could bepresented to some of them, that was too large for these learned gentlemen to atleast try to stuff into their pigeon-holes, labelled with some fancy Greek name,expressive of everything else but the true nature of the phenomenon. \"Alas, alas! my son!\" exclaims the wise Muphti, of Aleppo, to his son Ibrahim,who choked himself with the head of a huge fish. \"When will you realize thatyour stomach is smaller than the ocean?\" Or, as Mrs. Catherine Crowe remarks inher Night-Side of Nature, when will our scientists admit that \"their intellectsare no measure of God Almighty's designs?\" We will not ask which of the ancient writers mention facts ofseemingly-supernatural nature; but rather which of them does not? In Homer, wefind Ulysses evoking the spirit of his friend, the soothsayer Tiresias.Preparing for the ceremony of the \"festival of blood,\" Ulysses draws his sword,and thus frightens away the thousands of phantoms attracted by the sacrifice.The friend himself, the so-long-expected Tiresias, dares not approach him solong as Ulysses holds the dreaded weapon in his hand. * Æneas prepares todescend to the kingdom of the shadows, and as soon as they approach itsentrance, the Sibyl who guides him utters her warning to the Trojan hero, andorders him to draw his sword and clear himself a passage through the dense crowdof flitting forms: \"Tuque invade viam, vaginaque eripe ferrum.\" *Glanvil gives a wonderful narrative of the apparition of the \"Drummer ofTedworth,\" which happened in 1661; in which the scin-lecca, or double, of thedrummer-sorcerer was evidently very much afraid of the sword. Psellus, in hiswork, ** gives a long story of his sister-in-law being thrown into a mostfearful state by an elementary daimon taking possession of her. She was finallycured by a conjurer, a foreigner named Anaphalangis, who began by threateningthe invisible occupant of her body with a naked sword, until he finallydislodged him. Psellus introduces a whole catechism of demonology, which hegives in the following terms, as far as we remember: \"You want to know,\" asked the conjurer, \"whether the bodies of the spirits canbe hurt by sword or any other weapon? *** Yes, they can. Any hard substancestriking them can make them sensible to pain; and though their bodies be madeneither of solid nor firm substance, they feel it the same, for in beingsendowed with sensibility it is not their nerves only which possess the facultyof feeling, but likewise also the spirit which resides in them . . . the body ofa spirit can be sensible in its whole, as well as in each one of its parts.Without the help of any physical organism the spirit sees, hears, and if youtouch him feels your touch. If you divide him in two, he will feel the pain aswould any living man, for he is matter still, though so refined as to begenerally invisible to our eye. . . . One thing, however, distinguishes him fromthe living man, viz.: that when a man's limbs are once divided, their partscannot be reunited very easily. But, cut a demon in two, and you will see himimmediately join himself together. As water or air closes in behind a solidbody **** passing through it, and no trace is left, so does the body of a demoncondense itself again, when the penetrative weapon is withdrawn from the wound.But every rent made in it causes him pain nevertheless. That is why daimonsdread the point of a sword or any sharp weapon. Let those who want to see themflee try the experiment.\" One of the most learned scholars of his century, Bodin, the Demonologian, heldthe same opinion, that both the human and cosmical elementaries \"were sorelyafraid of swords and daggers.\" It is also the opinion of Porphyry, Iamblichus,and Plato. Plutarch mentions it several times. The practicing theurgists knew itwell and acted accordingly; and many of the latter assert that \"the demonssuffer from any rent made in their bodies.\" Bodin tells us a wonderful story tothis effect, in his work On the Daemons, p. 292. \"I remember,\" says the author, \"that in 1557 an elemental demon, one of thosewho are called thundering, fell down with the lightning, into the house ofPoudot, the shoemaker, and immediately began flinging stones all about the room.We picked up so many of them that the landlady filled a large chest full, afterhaving securely closed the windows and doors and locked the chest itself. But itdid not prevent the demon in the least from introducing other stones into theroom, but without injuring any one for all that. Latomi, who was thenQuarter-President, * came to see what was the matter. Immediately upon hisentrance, the spirit knocked the cap off his head and made him run away. It hadlasted for over six days, when M. Jean Morgnes, Counsellor at the Presidial,came to fetch me to see the mystery. When I entered the house, some one advisedthe master of it to pray to God with all his heart and to wheel round a sword inthe air about the room; he did so. On that following day the landlady told us,that from that very moment they did not hear the least noise in the house; butthat during the seven previous days that it lasted they could not get a moment'srest.\" The books on the witchcraft of the middle ages are full of such narratives. Thevery rare and interesting work of Glanvil, called Sadducismus Triumphatus, rankswith that of Bodin, above mentioned, as one of the best. But we must give spacenow to certain narratives of the more ancient philosophers, who explain at thesame time that they describe. And first in rank for wonders comes Proclus. His list of facts, most of which hesupports by the citation of witnesses--sometimes well-known philosophers--isstaggering. He records many instances in his time of dead persons who were foundto have changed their recumbent positions in the sepulchre, for one of eithersitting or standing, which he attributes to their being larvae, and which hesays \"is related by the ancients of Aristius, Epimenides, and Hermodorus.\" Hegives five such cases from the history of Clearchus, the disciple of Aristotle.1. Cleonymus, the Athenian. 2. Polykritus, an illustrious man among theAEolians. It is related by the historian Nomachius, that Polykritus died, andreturned in the ninth month after his death. \"Hiero, the Ephesian, and otherhistorians,\" says his translator, Taylor, \"testify to the truth of this.\" 3. InNicopolis, the same happened to one Eurinus. The latter revived on the fifteenthday after his burial, and lived for some time after that, leading an exemplarylife. 4. Rufus, a priest of Thessalonica, restored to life the third day afterhis death, for the purpose of performing certain sacred ceremonies according topromise; he fulfilled his engagement, and died again to return no more. 5. Thisis the case of one Philonaea, who lived under the reign of Philip. She was thedaughter of Demostratus and Charito of Amphipolos. Married against her wish toone Kroterus, she died soon after. But in the sixth month after her death, sherevived, as Proclus says: \"through her love of a youth named Machates, who cameto her father Demostratus, from Pella.\" She visited him for many nightssuccessively, but when this was finally discovered, she, or rather the vampirethat represented her, died of rage. Previous to this she declared that she actedin this manner according to the will of terrestrial demons. Her dead body wasseen at this second death by every one in the town, lying in her father's house.On opening the vault, where her body had been deposited, it was found empty bythose of her relatives, who being incredulous upon that point, went to ascertainthe truth. The narrative is corroborated by the Epistles of Hipparchus and thoseof Arridaeus to Philip. * Says Proclus: \"Many other of the ancients have collected a history of those thathave apparently died, and afterward revived. Among these is the naturalphilosopher Demokritus. In his writings concerning Hades, he affirms that [in acertain case under discussion] death was not, as it seemed, an entire desertionof the whole life of the body, but a cessation caused by some blow, or perhaps awound; but the bonds of the soul yet remained rooted about the marrow, and theheart contained in its profundity the empyreuma of life; and this remaining, itagain acquired the life, which had been extinguished, in consequence of beingadapted to animation.\" He says again, \"That it is possible for the soul to depart from and enter intothe body, is evident from him, who, according to Clearchus, used asoul-attracting wand on a sleeping boy; and who persuaded Aristotle, asClearchus relates in his Treatise on Sleep, that the soul may be separated fromthe body, and that it enters into a body and uses it as a lodging. For, strikingthe boy with the wand, he drew out, and, as it were, led his soul, for thepurpose of evincing that the body was immovable when the soul (astral body) wasat a distance from it, and that it was preserved uninjured; but the soul beingagain led into the body by means of the wand, after its entrance, narrated everyparticular. From this circumstance, therefore, both the spectators and Aristotlewere persuaded that the soul is separate from the body.\" It may be considered quite absurd to recall so often the facts of witchcraft, inthe full light of the nineteenth century. But the century itself is getting old;and as it gradually approaches the fatal end, it seems as if it were fallinginto dotage; not only does it refuse to recollect how abundantly the facts ofwitchcraft were proven, but it refuses to realize what has been going on for thelast thirty years, all over the wide world. After a lapse of several thousandyears we may doubt the magic powers of the Thessalonian priests and their\"sorceries,\" as mentioned by Pliny; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu009.htm#fn_538] we may throw discreditupon the information given us by Suidas, who narrates Medea's journey throughthe air, and thus forget that magic was the highest knowledge of naturalphilosophy; but how are we to dispose of the frequent occurrence of preciselysuch journeys \"through the air\" when they happen before our own eyes, and arecorroborated by the testimony of hundreds of apparently sane persons? If theuniversality of a belief be a proof of its truth, few facts have been betterestablished than that of sorcery. \"Every people, from the rudest to the mostrefined, we may also add in every age, have believed in the kind of supernaturalagency, which we understand by this term,\" says Thomas Wright, the author ofSorcery and Magic, and a skeptical member of the National Institute of France.\"It was founded on the equally extensive creed, that, besides our own visibleexistence, we live in an invisible world of spiritual beings, by which ouractions and even our thoughts are often guided, and which have a certain degreeof power over the elements and over the ordinary course of organic life.\"Further, marvelling how this mysterious science flourished everywhere, andnoticing several famous schools of magic in different parts of Europe, heexplains the time-honored belief, and shows the difference between sorcery andmagic as follows: \"The magician differed from the witch in this, that, while thelatter was an ignorant instrument in the hands of the demons, the former hadbecome their master by the powerful intermediation of Science, which was onlywithin reach of the few, and which these beings were unable to disobey.\" ** Thisdelineation, established and known since the days of Moses, the author gives asderived from \"the most authentic sources.\" If from this unbeliever we pass to the authority of an adept in that mysteriousscience, the anonymous author of Art-Magic, we find him stating the following:\"The reader may inquire wherein consists the difference between a medium and amagician? . . . The medium is one through whose astral spirit other spirits canmanifest, making their presence known by various kinds of phenomena. Whateverthese consist in, the medium is only a passive agent in their hands. He canneither command their presence, nor will their absence; can never compel theperformance of any special act, nor direct its nature. The magician, on thecontrary, can summon and dismiss spirits at will; can perform many feats ofoccult power through his own spirit; can compel the presence and assistance ofspirits of lower grades of being than himself, and effect transformations in therealm of nature upon animate and inanimate bodies.\" * This learned author forgot to point out a marked distinction in mediumship, withwhich he must have been entirely familiar. Physical phenomena are the result ofthe manipulation of forces through the physical system of the medium, by theunseen intelligences, of whatever class. In a word, physical mediumship dependson a peculiar organization of the physical system; spiritual mediumship, whichis accompanied by a display of subjective, intellectual phenomena, depends upona like peculiar organization of the spiritual nature of the medium. As thepotter from one lump of clay fashions a vessel of dishonor, and from another avessel of honor, so, among physical mediums, the plastic astral spirit of onemay be prepared for a certain class of objective phenomena, and that of anotherfor a different one. Once so prepared, it appears difficult to alter the phaseof mediumship, as when a bar of steel is forged into a certain shape, it cannotbe used for any other than its original purpose without difficulty. As a rule,mediums who have been developed for one class of phenomena rarely change toanother, but repeat the same performance ad infinitum. Psychography, or the direct writing of messages by spirits, partakes of bothforms of mediumship. The writing itself is an objective physical fact, while thesentiments it contains may be of the very noblest character. The latter dependentirely on the moral state of the medium. It does not require that he should beeducated, to write philosophical treatises worthy of Aristotle, nor a poet, towrite verses that would reflect honor upon a Byron or a Lamartine; but it doesrequire that the soul of the medium shall be pure enough to serve as a channelfor spirits who are capable of giving utterance to such lofty sentiments. In Art-Magic, one of the most delightful pictures presented to us is that of aninnocent little child-medium, in whose presence, during the past three years,four volumes of MSS., in the ancient Sanscrit, have been written by the spirits,without pens, pencils, or ink. \"It is enough,\" says the author, \"to lay theblank sheets on a tripod, carefully screened from the direct rays of light, butstill dimly visible to the eyes of attentive observers. The child sits on theground and lays her head on the tripod, embracing its supports with her littlearms. In this attitude she most commonly sleeps for an hour, during which timethe sheets lying on the tripod are filled up with exquisitely formed charactersin the ancient Sanscrit.\" This is so remarkable an instance of psychographicmediumship, and so thoroughly illustrates the principle we have above stated,that we cannot refrain from quoting a few lines from one of the Sanscritwritings, the more so as it embodies that portion of the Hermetic philosophyrelating to the antecedent state of man, which elsewhere we have lesssatisfactorily described. \"Man lives on many earths before he reaches this. Myriads of worlds swarm inspace where the soul in rudimental states performs its pilgrimages, ere hereaches the large and shining planet named the Earth, the glorious function ofwhich is to confer self-consciousness. At this point only is he man; at everyother stage of his vast, wild journey he is but an embryonic being--a fleeting,temporary shape of matter--a creature in which a part, but only a part, of thehigh, imprisoned soul shines forth; a rudimental shape, with rudimentalfunctions, ever living, dying, sustaining a flitting spiritual existence asrudimental as the material shape from whence it emerged; a butterfly, springingup from the chrysalitic shell, but ever, as it onward rushes, in new births, newdeaths, new incarnations, anon to die and live again, but still stretch upward,still strive onward, still rush on the giddy, dreadful, toilsome, rugged path,until it awakens once more--once more to live and be a material shape, a thingof dust, a creature of flesh and blood, but now--a man.\" * We witnessed once in India a trial of psychical skill between a holy gossein **and a sorcerer, *** which recurs to us in this connection. We had beendiscussing the relative powers of the fakir's Pitris,--pre-Adamite spirits, andthe juggler's invisible allies. A trial of skill was agreed upon, and the writerwas chosen as a referee. We were taking our noon-day rest, beside a small lakein Northern India. Upon the surface of the glassy water floated innumerableaquatic flowers, and large shining leaves. Each of the contestants plucked aleaf. The fakir, laying his against his breast, folded his hands across it, andfell into a momentary trance. He then laid the leaf, with its surface downward,upon the water. The juggler pretended to control the \"water-master,\" the spiritdwelling in the water; and boasted that he would compel the power to prevent thePitris from manifesting any phenomena upon the fakir's leaf in their element. Hetook his own leaf and tossed it upon the water, after going through a form ofbarbarous incantation. It at once exhibited a violent agitation, while the otherleaf remained perfectly motionless. After the lapse of a few seconds, bothleaves were recovered. Upon that of the fakir were found--much to theindignation of the juggler--something that looked like a symmetrical designtraced in milk-white characters, as though the juices of the plant had been usedas a corrosive writing fluid. When it became dry, and an opportunity wasafforded to examine the lines with care, it proved to be a series ofexquisitely-formed Sanscrit characters; the whole composed a sentence embodyinga high moral precept. The fakir, let us add, could neither read nor write. Uponthe juggler's leaf, instead of writing, was found the tracing of a most hideous,impish face. Each leaf, therefore, bore an impression or allegorical reflectionof the character of the contestant, and indicated the quality of spiritualbeings with which he was surrounded. But, with deep regret, we must once moreleave India, with its blue sky and mysterious past, its religious devotees andits weird sorcerers, and on the enchanted carpet of the historian, transportourselves back to the musty atmosphere of the French Academy. To appreciate the timidity, prejudice, and superficiality which have marked thetreatment of psychological subjects in the past, we propose to review a bookwhich lies before us. It is the Histoire du Merveilleux dans les Temps Modernes.The work is published by its author, the learned Dr. Figuier, and teems withquotations from the most conspicuous authorities in physiology, psychology, andmedicine. Dr. Calmeil, the well-known director-in-chief of Charenton, the famouslunatic asylum of France, is the robust Atlas on whose mighty shoulders reststhis world of erudition. As the ripe fruit of the thought of 1860 it mustforever keep a place among the most curious of works of art. Moved by therestless demon of science, determined to kill superstition--and, as aconsequence, spiritism--at one blow, the author affords us a summary view of themost remarkable instances of mediumistic phenomena during the last twocenturies. The discussion embraces the Prophets of Cevennes, the Camisards, the Jansenists,the Abbe Paris, and other historical epidemics, which, as they have beendescribed during the last twenty years by nearly every writer upon the modernphenomena, we will mention as briefly as possible. It is not facts that wedesire to bring again under discussion, but merely the way in which such factswere regarded and treated by those who, as physicians and recognizedauthorities, had the greater responsibility in such questions. If thisprejudiced author is introduced to our readers at this time, it is only becausehis work enables us to show what occult facts and manifestations may expect fromorthodox science. When the most world-renowned psychological epidemics are sotreated, what will induce a materialist to seriously study other phenomena aswell authenticated and as interesting, but still less popular? Let it beremembered that the reports made by various committees to their respectiveacademies at that time, as well as the records of the judicial tribunals, arestill in existence, and may be consulted for purposes of verification. It isfrom such unimpeachable sources that Dr. Figuier compiled his extraordinarywork. We must give, at least, in substance, the unparalleled arguments withwhich the author seeks to demolish every form of super-naturalism, together withthe commentaries of the demonological des Mousseaux, who, in one of his works, *pounces upon his skeptical victim like a tiger upon his prey. Between the two champions--the materialist and the bigot--the unbiassed studentmay glean a good harvest. We will begin with the Convulsionnaires of Cevennes, the epidemic of whoseastounding phenomena occurred during the latter part of 1700. The mercilessmeasures adopted by the French Catholics to extirpate the spirit of prophecyfrom an entire population, is historical, and needs no repetition here. The factalone that a mere handful of men, women, and children, not exceeding 2,000persons in number, could withstand for years king's troops, which, with themilitia, amounted to 60,000 men, is a miracle in itself. The marvels are allrecorded, and the proces verbaux of the time preserved in the Archives of Franceuntil this day. There is in existence an official report among others, which wassent to Rome by the ferocious Abbe Chayla, the prior of Laval, in which hecomplains that the Evil One is so powerful, that no torture, no amount ofinquisitory exorcism, is able to dislodge him from the Cevennois. He adds, thathe closed their hands upon burning coals, and they were not even singed; that hehad wrapped their whole persons in cotton soaked with oil, and had set them onfire, and in many cases did not find one blister on their skins; that balls wereshot at them, and found flattened between the skin and clothes, without injuringthem, etc., etc. Accepting the whole of the above as a solid ground-work for his learnedarguments, this is what Dr. Figuier says: \"Toward the close of the seventeenthcentury, an old maid imports into Cevennes the spirit of prophecy. Shecommunicates it (?) to young boys and girls, who transpire it in their turn, andspread it in the surrounding atmosphere. . . . Women and children become themost sensitive to the infection\" (vol. ii., p. 261). \"Men, women, and babiesspeak under inspiration, not in ordinary patois, but in the purest French--alanguage at that time utterly unknown in the country. Children of twelve months,and even less, as we learn from the proces verbaux, who previously could hardlyutter a few short syllables, spoke fluently, and prophesied.\" \"Eight thousandprophets,\" says Figuier, \"were scattered over the country; doctors and eminentphysicians were sent for.\" Half of the medical schools of France, among others,the Faculty of Montpellier, hastened to the spot. Consultations were held, andthe physicians declared themselves \"delighted, lost in wonder and admiration,upon hearing young girls and boys, ignorant and illiterate, deliver discourseson things they had never learned.\" * The sentence pronounced by Figuier againstthese treacherous professional brethren, for being so delighted with the youngprophets, is that they \"did not understand, themselves, what they saw.\" ** Manyof the prophets forcibly communicated their spirit to those who tried to breakthe spell. *** A great number of them were between three and twelve years ofage; still others were at the breast, and spoke French distinctly andcorrectly. **** These discourses, which often lasted for several hours, wouldhave been impossible to the little orators, were the latter in their natural ornormal state. ***** \"Now,\" asks the reviewer, \"what was the meaning of such a series of prodigies,all of them freely admitted in Figuier's book? No meaning at all! It wasnothing,\" he says, \"except the effect of a 'momentary exaltation of theintellectual faculties.' \" ****** \"These phenomena,\" he adds, \"are observable inmany of the cerebral affections.\" \"Momentary exaltation, lasting for many hours in the brains of babies under oneyear old, not weaned yet, speaking good French before they had learned to sayone word in their own patois! Oh, miracle of physiology! Prodigy ought to be thyname!\" exclaims des Mousseaux. \"Dr. Calmeil, in his work on insanity,\" remarks Figuier, \"when reporting on theecstatic theomania of the Calvinists, concludes that the disease must beattributed in the simpler cases to HYSTERIA, and in those of more seriouscharacter to epilepsy. . . . We rather incline to the opinion,\" says Figuier,\"that it was a disease sui generis, and in order to have an appropriate name forsuch a disease, we must be satisfied with the one of the TremblingConvulsionaires of Cevennes.\" * Theomania and hysteria, again! The medical corporations must themselves bepossessed with an incurable atomomania; otherwise why should they give out suchabsurdities for science, and hope for their acceptance? \"Such was the fury for exorcising and roasting,\" continues Figuier, \"that monkssaw possessions by demons everywhere when they felt in need of miracles toeither throw more light on the omnipotency of the Devil, or keep theirdinner-pot boiling at the convent.\" ** For this sarcasm the pious des Mousseaux expresses a heartfelt gratitude toFiguier; for, as he remarks, \"he is in France one of the first writers whom wefind, to our surprise, not denying the phenomena which have been made long sinceundeniable. Moved by a sense of lofty superiority and even disdain for themethod used by his predecessors, Dr. Figuier desires his readers to know that hedoes not follow the same path as they. 'We will not reject,' says he, 'as beingunworthy of credit, facts only because they are embarrassing for our system. Onthe contrary, we will collect all of the facts that the same historical evidencehas transmitted to us . . . and which, consequently, are entitled to the samecredence, and it is upon the whole mass of such facts that we will base thenatural explanation, which we have to offer, in our turn, as a sequel to thoseof the savants who have preceded us on this subject.' \" *** Thereupon, Dr. Figuier proceeds. **** He takes a few steps, and, placing himselfright in the midst of the Convulsionaires of St. Medard, he invites his readersto scrutinize, under his direction, prodigies which are for him but simpleeffects of nature. But before we proceed, in our turn, to show Dr. Figuier's opinion, we mustrefresh the reader's memory as to what the Jansenist miracles comprised,according to historical evidence. Abbe Paris was a Jansenist, who died in 1727. Immediately after his decease themost surprising phenomena began to occur at his tomb. The churchyard was crowdedfrom morning till night. Jesuits, exasperated at seeing heretics perform wondersin healing, and other works, got from the magistrates an order to close allaccess to the tomb of the Abbe. But, notwithstanding every opposition, thewonders lasted for over twenty years. Bishop Douglas, who went to Paris for thatsole purpose in 1749, visited the place, and he reports that the miracles werestill going on among the Convulsionaires. When every endeavor to stop themfailed, the Catholic clergy were forced to admit their reality, but screenedthemselves, as usual, behind the Devil. Hume, in his Philosophical Essays, says:\"There surely never was so great a number of miracles ascribed to one person asthose which were lately said to have been wrought in France upon the tomb of theAbbe Paris. The curing of the sick, giving hearing to the deaf and sight to theblind, were everywhere talked of as the effects of the holy sepulchre. But, whatis more extraordinary, many of the miracles were immediately proved upon thespot, before judges of unquestioned credit and distinction, in a learned age,and on the most eminent theatre that is now in the world . . . nor were theJesuits, though a learned body, supported by the civil magistrates, anddetermined enemies to those opinions in whose favor the miracles were said tohave been wrought, ever able distinctly to refute or detect them . . . such ishistoric evidence.\" * Dr. Middleton, in his Free Enquiry, a book which be wroteat a period when the manifestations were already decreasing, i.e., aboutnineteen years after they had first begun, declares that the evidence of thesemiracles is fully as strong as that of the wonders recorded of the Apostles. The phenomena so well authenticated by thousands of witnesses beforemagistrates, and in spite of the Catholic clergy, are among the most wonderfulin history. Carre de Montgeron, a member of parliament and a man who becamefamous for his connection with the Jansenists, enumerates them carefully in hiswork. It comprises four thick quarto volumes, of which the first is dedicated tothe king, under the title: \"La Verite des Miracles operes par l'Intercession deM. de Paris, demontree contre l'Archeveque de Sens. Ouvrage dedie au Roi, par M.de Montgeron, Conseiller au Parlement.\" The author presents a vast amount ofpersonal and official evidence to the truthfulness of every case. For speakingdisrespectfully of the Roman clergy, Montgeron was thrown into the Bastille, buthis work was accepted. And now for the views of Dr. Figuier upon these remarkable and unquestionablyhistorical phenomena. \"A Convulsionary bends back into an arc, her loinssupported by the sharp point of a peg,\" quotes the learned author, from theproces verbaux. \"The pleasure that she begs for is to be pounded by a stoneweighing fifty pounds, and suspended by a rope passing over a pulley fixed tothe ceiling. The stone, being hoisted to its extreme height, falls with all itsweight upon the patient's stomach, her back resting all the while on the sharppoint of the peg. Montgeron and numerous other witnesses testified to the factthat neither the flesh nor the skin of the back were ever marked in the least,and that the girl, to show she suffered no pain whatever, kept crying out,'Strike harder--harder!' \"Jeanne Maulet, a girl of twenty, leaning with her back against a wall, receivedupon her stomach one hundred blows of a hammer weighing thirty pounds; theblows, administered by a very strong man, were so terrible that they shook thewall. To test the force of the blows, Montgeron tried them on the stone wallagainst which the girl was leaning. . . . He gets one of the instruments of theJansenist healing, called the 'GRAND SECOURS.' At the twenty-fifth blow,\" hewrites, \"the stone upon which I struck, which had been shaken by the precedingefforts, suddenly became loose and fell on the other side of the wall, making anaperture more than half a foot in size.\" When the blows are struck with violenceupon an iron drill held against the stomach of a Convulsionnaire (who,sometimes, is but a weak woman), \"it seems,\" says Montgeron, \"as if it wouldpenetrate through to the spine and rupture all the entrails under the force ofthe blows\" (vol. i., p. 380). \"But, so far from that occurring, theConvulsionnaire cries out, with an expression of perfect rapture in her face,'Oh, how delightful! Oh, that does me good! Courage, brother; strike twice ashard, if you can!' It now remains,\" continues Dr. Figuier, \"to try to explainthe strange phenomena which we have described.\" \"We have said, in the introduction to this work, that at the middle of thenineteenth century one of the most famous epidemics of possession broke out inGermany: that of the Nonnains, who performed all the miracles most admired sincethe days of St. Medard, and even some greater ones; who turned summersaults, whoCLIMBED DEAD WALLS, and spoke FOREIGN LANGUAGES.\" * The official report of the wonders, which is more full than that of Figuier,adds such further particulars as that \"the affected persons would stand on theirheads for hours together, and correctly describe distant events, even such aswere happening in the homes of the committee-men; as it was subsequentlyverified. Men and women were held suspended in the air, by an invisible force,and the combined efforts of the committee were insufficient to pull them down.Old women climbed perpendicular walls thirty feet in height with the agility ofwild cats, etc., etc.\" Now, one should expect that the learned critic, the eminent physician andpsychologist, who not only credits such incredible phenomena but himselfdescribes them minutely, and con amore, so to say, would necessarily startle thereading public with some explanation so extraordinary that his scientific viewswould cause a real hegira to the unexplored fields of psychology. Well, he doesstartle us, for to all this he quietly observes: \"Recourse was had to marriageto bring to a stop these disorders of the Convulsionnaires!\" * For once des Mousseaux had the best of his enemy: \"Marriage, do you understandthis?\" he remarks. \"Marriage cures them of this faculty of climbing dead-wallslike so many flies, and of speaking foreign languages. Oh! the curiousproperties of marriage in those remarkable days!\" \"It should be added,\" continues Figuier, \"that with the fanatics of St. Medard,the blows were never administered except during the convulsive crisis; and that,therefore, as Dr. Calmeil suggests, meteorism of the abdomen, the state of spasmof the uterus of women, of the alimentary canal in all cases, the state ofcontraction, of erethism, of turgescence of the carneous envelopes of themuscular coats which protect and cover the abdomen, chest, and principalvascular masses and the osseous surfaces, may have singularly contributed towardreducing, and even destroying, the force of the blows!\" \"The astounding resistance that the skin, the areolar tissue, the surface of thebodies and limbs of the Convulsionnaires offered to things which seem as if theyought to have torn or crushed them, is of a nature to excite more surprise.Nevertheless, it can be explained. This resisting force, this insensibility,seems to partake of the extreme changes in sensibility which can occur in theanimal economy during a time of great exaltation. Anger, fear, in a word, everypassion, provided that it be carried to a paroxysmal point, can produce thisinsensibility.\" ** \"Let us remark, besides,\" rejoins Dr. Calmeil, quoted by Figuier, \"that forstriking upon the bodies of the Convulsionnaires use was made either of massiveobjects with flat or rounded surfaces, or of cylindrical and blunt shapes. ***The action of such physical agents is not to be compared, in respect to thedanger which attaches to it, with that of cords, supple or flexible instruments,and those having a sharp edge. In fine, the contact and the shock of the blowsproduced upon the Convulsionnaires the effect of a salutary shampooing, andreduced the violence of the tortures of HYSTERIA.\" The reader will please observe that this is not intended as a joke, but is thesober theory of one of the most eminent of French physicians, hoary with age andexperience, the Director-in-Chief of the Government Insane Asylum at Charenton.Really, the above explanation might lead the reader to a strange suspicion. Wemight imagine, perhaps, that Dr. Calmeil has kept company with the patientsunder his care a few more years than was good for the healthy action of his ownbrain. Besides, when Figuier talks of massive objects, of cylindrical and blunt shapes,he surely forgets the sharp swords, pointed iron pegs, and the hatchets, ofwhich he himself gave a graphic description on page 409 of his first volume. Thebrother of Elie Marion is shown by him striking his stomach and abdomen with thesharp point of a knife, with tremendous force, \"his body all the while resistingas if it were made of iron.\" Arrived at this point, des Mousseaux loses all patience, and indignantlyexclaims: \"Was the learned physician quite awake when writing the above sentences? . . .If, perchance, the Drs. Calmeil and Figuier should seriously maintain theirassertions and insist on their theory, we are ready to answer them as follows:'We are perfectly willing to believe you. But before such a superhuman effort ofcondescension, will you not demonstrate to us the truth of your theory in a morepractical manner? Let us, for example, develop in you a violent and terriblepassion; anger--rage if you choose. You shall permit us for a single moment tobe in your sight irritating, rude, and insulting. Of course, we will be so onlyat your request and in the interest of science and your cause. Our duty underthe contract will consist in humiliating and provoking you to the lastextremity. Before a public audience, who shall know nothing of our agreement,but whom you must satisfy as to your assertions, we will insult you; . . . wewill tell you that your writings are an ambuscade to truth, an insult to commonsense, a disgrace which paper only can bear; but which the public shouldchastise. We will add that you lie to science, you lie to the ears of theignorant and stupid fools gathered around you, open-mouthed, like the crowdaround a peddling quack. . . . And when, transported beyond yourself, your faceablaze, and anger tumefying, you shall have displaced your fluids; when yourfury has reached the point of bursting, we will cause your turgescent muscles tobe struck with powerful blows; your friends shall show us the most insensibleplaces; we will let a perfect shower, an avalanche of stones fall upon them . .. for so was treated the flesh of the convulsed women whose appetite for suchblows could never be satisfied. But, in order to procure for you thegratification of a salutary shampooing--as you deliciously express it--yourlimbs shall only be pounded with objects having blunt surfaces and cylindricalshapes, with clubs and sticks devoid of suppleness, and, if you prefer it,neatly turned in a lathe.' \" So liberal is des Mousseaux, so determined to accommodate his antagonists withevery possible chance to prove their theory, that he offers them the choice tosubstitute for themselves in the experiment their wives, mothers, daughters, andsisters, \"since,\" he says, \"you have remarked that the weaker sex is the strongand resistant sex in these disconcerting trials.\" Useless to remark that des Mousseaux's challenge remained unanswered.

Chemistry teaches us that in man's body there are air,water, earth, and heat, or fire--air is present in its components; water in thesecretions; earth in the inorganic constituents; and fire in the animal heat.The Kabalist knows by experience that an elemental spirit contains only one, andthat each one of the four kingdoms has its own peculiar elemental spirits; manbeing higher than they, the law of evolution finds its illustration in thecombination of all four in him. 344:* Gorres: \"Mystique,\" lib. iii., p. 63. 344:** The ancients called \"the soul\" the spirits of bad people; the soul wasthe larva and lemure.

If this be so, how account for thedoctrine of the metempsychosis of Pythagoras, which is far more that of theHindu in its details than the Egyptian? But, above all, how account for the factthat the name MONAS, applied by him to the First Cause, is the identicalappellation given to that Being in the Sanscrit tongue? In 1792-7, whenLempriere's \"Dictionary\" appeared, the Sanscrit was, we may say, utterlyunknown; Dr. Haug's translation of the \"Aitareya Brahmana\" (\"Rig-Vedas\"), inwhich this word occurs, was published only about twenty years ago, and untilthat valuable addition to the literature of archaic ages was completed, and theprecise age of the \"Aitareya\"--now fixed by Haug at 2000-2400 B.C.--was amystery, it might be suggested, as in the case of Christian symbols, that theHindus borrowed it from Pythagoras. But now, unless philology can show it to bea \"coincidence,\" and that the word Monas is not the same in its minutestdefinitions, we have a right to assert that Pythagoras was in India, and that itwas the Gymnosophists who instructed him in his metaphysical theology. The factalone that \"Sanscrit, as compared with Greek and Latin, is an elder sister,\" asMax Muller shows, is not sufficient to account for the perfect identity of theSanscrit and Greek words MONAS, in their most metaphysical, abstruse sense. TheSanscrit word Deva (god) has become the Latin deus, and points to a commonsource; but we see in the Zoroastrian \"Zend-Avesta\" the same word, meaningdiametrically the opposite, and becoming daeva, or evil spirit, from which comesthe word devil. 348:* Haug: \"Aitareya Brahmanam.\" 348:** Ibid. 349:* Berosus: fragment preserved by Alex.

Tappan, in a public discourse upon the \"Historyof Occultism and its Relations to Spiritualism\" (see \"Banner of Light,\" Aug. 26,1876), \"that the ancient word witchcraft, or the exercise of it, was forbiddenamong the Hebrews. The translation is that no witch should be allowed to live.That has been supposed to be the literal interpretation; and acting upon that,your very pious and devout ancestors put to death, without adequate testimony,numbers of very intelligent, wise, and sincere persons, under the condemnationof witchcraft. It has now turned out that the interpretation or translationshould be, that no witches should be allowed to obtain a living by the practiceof their art. That is, it should not be made a profession.\" May we be so bold asto inquire of the celebrated speaker, through whom or according to whatauthority such a thing has ever turned out? 356:** Mr. Cromwell F. Varley, the well-known electrician of the Atlantic CableCompany, communicates the result of his observations, in the course of a debateat the Psychological Society of Great Britain, which is reported in the\"Spiritualist\" (London, April 14, 1876, pp. 174, 175). He thought that theeffect of free nitric acid in the atmosphere was able to drive away what hecalls \"unpleasant spirits.\" He thought that those who were troubled byunpleasant spirits at home, would find relief by pouring one ounce of vitriolupon two ounces of finely-powdered nitre in a saucer and putting the mixtureunder the bed. Here is a scientist, whose reputation extends over twocontinents, who gives a recipe to drive away bad spirits. And yet the generalpublic mocks as a \"superstition\" the herbs and incenses employed by Hindus,Chinese, Africans, and other races to accomplish the self-same purpose. 358:* \"Art-Magic,\" p. 97. 360:* This phantom is called Scin Lecca.

This insensibility of the human body to the impact of heavyblows, and resistance to penetration by sharp points and musket-bullets, is aphenomenon sufficiently familiar in the experience of all times and allcountries. While science is entirely unable to give any reasonable explanationof the mystery, the question appears to offer no difficulty to mesmerists, whohave well studied the properties of the fluid. The man, who by a few passes overa limb can produce a local paralysis so as to render it utterly insensible toburns, cuts, and the prickings of needles, need be but very little astonished atthe phenomena of the Jansenists. As to the adepts of magic, especially in Siamand the East Indies, they are too familiar with the properties of the akasa, themysterious life-fluid, to even regard the insensibility of the Convulsionnairesas a very great phenomenon. The astral fluid can be compressed about a person soas to form an elastic shell, absolutely nonpenetrable by any physical object,however great the velocity with which it travels. In a word, this fluid can bemade to equal and even excel in resisting-power, water and air. In India, Malabar, and some places of Central Africa, the conjurers will freelypermit any traveller to fire his musket or revolver at them, without touchingthe weapon themselves or selecting the balls. In Laing's Travels among Timanni,the Kourankos, and the Soulimas, occurs a description by an English traveller,the first white man to visit the tribe of the Soulimas, near the sources of theDialliba, of a very curious scene. A body of picked soldiers fired upon a chiefwho had nothing to defend himself with but certain talismans. Although theirmuskets were properly loaded and aimed, not a ball could strike him. Salvertegives a similar case in his Philosophy of Occult Sciences: \"In 1568, the Princeof Orange condemned a Spanish prisoner to be shot at Juliers; the soldiers tiedhim to a tree and fired, but he was invulnerable. They at last stripped him tosee what armor he wore, but found only an amulet. When this was taken from him,he fell dead at the first shot.\" This is a very different affair from the dexterous trickery resorted to byHoudin in Algeria. He prepared balls himself of tallow, blackened with soot, andby sleight of hand exchanged them for the real bullets, which the Arab sheikssupposed they were placing in the pistols. The simple-minded natives, knowingnothing but real magic, which they had inherited from their ancestors, and whichconsists in each case of some one thing that they can do without knowing why orhow, and seeing Houdin, as they thought, accomplish the same results in a moreimpressive manner, fancied that he was a greater magician than themselves. Manytravellers, the writer included, have witnessed instances of thisinvulnerability where deception was impossible. A few years ago, there lived inan African village, an Abyssinian who passed for a sorcerer. Upon one occasion aparty of Europeans, going to Soudan, amused themselves for an hour or two infiring at him with their own pistols and muskets, a privilege which he gave themfor a trifling fee. As many as five shots were fired simultaneously, by aFrenchman named Langlois, and the muzzles of the pieces were not above two yardsdistant from the sorcerer's breast. In each case, simultaneously with the flash,the bullet would appear just beyond the muzzle, quivering in the air, and then,after describing a short parabola, fall harmlessly to the ground. A German ofthe party, who was going in search of ostrich feathers, offered the magician afive-franc piece if he would allow him to fire his gun with the muzzle touchinghis body. The man at first refused; but, finally, after appearing to holdconversation with somebody inside the ground, consented. The experimentercarefully loaded, and pressing the muzzle of the weapon against the sorcerer'sbody, after a moment's hesitation, fired . . . the barrel burst into fragmentsas far down as the stock, and the man walked off unhurt. This quality of invulnerability can be imparted to persons both by living adeptsand by spirits. In our own time several well-known mediums have frequently, inthe presence of the most respectable witnesses, not only handled blazing coalsand actually placed their face upon a fire without singeing a hair, but evenlaid flaming coals upon the heads and hands of bystanders, as in the case ofLord Lindsay and Lord Adair. The well-known story of the Indian chief, whoconfessed to Washington that at Braddock's defeat he had fired his rifle at himseventeen times at short range without being able to touch him, will recur tothe reader in this connection. In fact, many great commanders have been believedby their soldiers to bear what is called \"a charmed life\"; and Prince Emile vonSayn-Wittgenstein, a general of the Russian army, is said to be one of these. This same power which enables one to compress the astral fluid so as to form animpenetrable shell around one, can be used to direct, so to speak, a bolt of thefluid against a given object, with fatal force. Many a dark revenge has beentaken in that way; and in such cases the coroner's inquest will never discloseanything but sudden death, apparently resulting from heart-disease, anapoplectic fit, or some other natural, but still not veritable cause. Manypersons firmly believe that certain individuals possess the power of the evileye. The mal'occhio, or jettatura is a belief which is prevalent throughoutItaly and Southern Europe. The Pope is held to be possessed--perchanceunconsciously--of that disagreeable gift. There are persons who can kill toadsby merely looking at them, and can even slay individuals. The malignance oftheir desire brings evil forces to a focus, and the death-dealing bolt isprojected, as though it were a bullet from a rifle. In 1864, in the French province of Le Var, near the little village of Brignoles,lived a peasant named Jacques Pelissier, who made a living by killing birds bysimple will-power. His case is reported by the well-known Dr. d'Alger, at whoserequest the singular hunter gave exhibitions to several scientific men, of hismethod of proceeding. The story is told as follows: \"At about fifteen or twentypaces from us, I saw a charming little meadow-lark which I showed to Jacques.'Watch him well, monsieur,' said he, 'he is mine.' Instantly stretching hisright hand toward the bird, he approached him gently. The meadow-lark stops,raises and lowers his pretty head, spreads his wings, but cannot fly; at last hecannot make a step further and suffers himself to be taken, only moving hiswings with a feeble fluttering. I examine the bird, his eyes are tightly closedand his body has a corpse-like stiffness, although the pulsations of the heartare very distinct; it is a true cataleptic sleep, and all the phenomenaincontestably prove a magnetic action. Fourteen little birds were taken in thisway, within the space of an hour; none could resist the power of Master Jacques,and all presented the same cataleptic sleep; a sleep which, moreover, terminatesat the will of the hunter, whose humble slaves these little birds have become. \"A hundred times, perhaps, I asked Jacques to restore life and movement to hisprisoners, to charm them only half way, so that they might hop along the ground,and then again bring them completely under the charm. All my requests wereexactly complied with, and not one single failure was made by this remarkableNimrod, who finally said to me: 'If you wish it, I will kill those which youdesignate without touching them.' I pointed out two for the experiment, and, attwenty-five or thirty paces distance, he accomplished in less than five minuteswhat he had promised.\" * A most curious feature of the above case is, that Jacques had complete poweronly over sparrows, robins, goldfinches, and meadow-larks; he could sometimescharm skylarks, but, as he says, \"they often escape me.\" This same power is exercised with greater force by persons known as wild beasttamers. On the banks of the Nile, some of the natives can charm the crocodilesout of the water, with a peculiarly melodious, low whistle, and handle them withimpunity; while others possess such powers over the most deadly snakes.Travellers tell of seeing the charmers surrounded by multitudes of the reptileswhich they dispatch at their leisure. Bruce, Hasselquist, and Lempriere, ** testify to the fact that they have seen inEgypt, Morocco, Arabia, and especially in the Senaar, some natives utterlydisregarding the bites of the most poisonous vipers, as well as the stings ofscorpions. They handle and play with them, and throw them at will into a stateof stupor. \"In vain do the Latin and Greek writers,\" says Salverte, \"assure usthat the gift of charming venomous reptiles was hereditary in certain familiesfrom time immemorial, that in Africa the same gift was enjoyed by the Psylli;that the Marses in Italy, and the Ophiozenes in Cyprus possessed it.\" Theskeptics forget that, in Italy, even at the commencement of the sixteenthcentury, men, claiming to be descended from the family of Saint Paul, braved,like the Marses, the bites of serpents.\" *** \"Doubts upon this subject,\" he goes on to say, \"were removed forever at the timeof the expedition of the French into Egypt, and the following relation isattested by thousands of eye-witnesses. The Psylli, who pretended, as Bruce hadrelated, to possess that faculty . . . went from house to house to destroyserpents of every kind. . . . A wonderful instinct drew them at first toward theplace in which the serpents were hidden; furious, howling, and foaming, theyseized and tore them asunder with their nails and teeth.\" \"Let us place,\" says Salverte, inveterate skeptic himself, \"to the account ofcharlatanism, the howling and the fury; still, the instinct which warned thePsylli of the presence of the serpents, has in it something more real.\" In theAntilles, the negroes discover, by its odor, a serpent which they do not see. *\"In Egypt, the same tact, formerly possessed, is still enjoyed by men brought upto it from infancy, and born as with an assumed hereditary gift to huntserpents, and to discover them even at a distance too great for the effluvia tobe perceptible to the dull organs of a European. The principal fact above allothers, the faculty or rendering dangerous animals powerless, merely by touchingthem, remains well verified, and we shall, perhaps, never understand better thenature of this secret, celebrated in antiquity, and preserved to our time by themost ignorant of men.\" ** Music is delightful to every person. Low whistling, a melodious chant, or thesounds of a flute will invariably attract reptiles in countries where they arefound. We have witnessed and verified the fact repeatedly. In Upper Egypt,whenever our caravan stopped, a young traveller, who believed he excelled on theflute, amused the company by playing. The camel-drivers and other Arabsinvariably checked him, having been several times annoyed by the unexpectedappearance of various families of the reptile tribe, which generally shirk anencounter with men. Finally, our caravan met with a party, among whom wereprofessional serpent-charmers, and the virtuoso was then invited, forexperiment's sake, to display his skill. No sooner had he commenced, than aslight rustling was heard, and the musician was horrified at suddenly seeing alarge snake appear in dangerous proximity with his legs. The serpent, withuplifted head and eyes fixed on him, slowly, and, as if unconsciously, crawled,softly undulating its body, and following his every movement. Then appeared at adistance another one, then a third, and a fourth, which were speedily followedby others, until we found ourselves quite in a select company. Several of thetravellers made for the backs of their camels, while others sought refuge in thecantinier's tent. But it was a vain alarm. The charmers, three in number, begantheir chants and incantations, and, attracting the reptiles, were very sooncovered with them from head to foot. As soon as the serpents approached the men,they exhibited signs of torpor, and were soon plunged in a deep catalepsy. Theireyes were half closed and glazed, and their heads drooping. There remained butone recalcitrant, a large and glossy black fellow, with a spotted skin. Thismeloman of the desert went on gracefully nodding and leaping, as if it haddanced on its tail all its life, and keeping time to the notes of the flute.This snake would not be enticed by the \"charming\" of the Arabs, but kept slowlymoving in the direction of the flute-player, who at last took to his heels. Themodern Psyllian then took out of his bag a half-withered plant, which he keptwaving in the direction of the serpent. It had a strong smell of mint, and assoon as the reptile caught its odor, it followed the Arab, still erect upon itstail, but now approaching the plant. A few more seconds, and the \"traditionalenemy\" of man was seen entwined around the arm of his charmer, became torpid inits turn, and the whole lot were then thrown together in a pool, after havingtheir heads cut off. Many believe that all such snakes are prepared and trained for the purpose, andthat they are either deprived of their fangs, or have their mouths sewed up.There may be, doubtless, some inferior jugglers, whose trickery has given riseto such an idea. But the genuine serpent-charmer has too well established hisclaims in the East, to resort to any such cheap fraud. They have the testimonyon this subject of too many trustworthy travellers, including some scientists,to be accused of any such charlatanism. That the snakes, which are charmed todance and to become harmless, are still poisonous, is verified by Forbes. \"Onthe music stopping too suddenly,\" says he, \"or from some other cause, theserpent, who had been dancing within a circle of country-people, darted amongthe spectators, and inflicted a wound in the throat of a young woman, who diedin agony, in half an hour afterward.\" * According to the accounts of many travellers the negro women of Dutch Guiana,the Obeah women, excel in taming very large snakes called amodites, or papa;they make them descend from the trees, follow, and obey them by merely speakingto them. ** We have seen in India a small brotherhood of fakirs settled round a little lake,or rather a deep pool of water, the bottom of which was literally carpeted withenormous alligators. These amphibious monsters crawl out, and warm themselves inthe sun, a few feet from the fakirs, some of whom may be motionless, lost inprayer and contemplation. So long as one of these holy beggars remains in view,the crocodiles are as harmless as kittens. But we would never advise a foreignerto risk himself alone within a few yards of these monsters. The poor FrenchmanPradin found an untimely grave in one of these terrible Saurians, commonlycalled by the Hindus Moudela. *** (This word should be nihang or ghariyal.) When Iamblichus, Herodotus, Pliny, or some other ancient writer tells us ofpriests who caused asps to come forth from the altar of Isis, or ofthaumaturgists taming with a glance the most ferocious animals, they areconsidered liars and ignorant imbeciles. When modern travellers tell us of thesame wonders performed in the East, they are set down as enthusiastic jabberers,or untrustworthy writers. But, despite materialistic skepticism, man does possess such a power, as we seemanifested in the above instances. When psychology and physiology become worthyof the name of sciences, Europeans will be convinced of the weird and formidablepotency existing in the human will and imagination, whether exercisedconsciously or otherwise. And yet, how easy to realize such power in spirit, ifwe only think of that grand truism in nature that every most insignificant atomin it is moved by spirit, which is one in its essence, for the least particle ofit represents the whole; and that matter is but the concrete copy of theabstract idea, after all. In this connection, let us cite a few instances of theimperial power of even the unconscious will, to create according to theimagination or rather the faculty of discerning images in the astral light. We have but to recall the very familiar phenomenon of stigmata, or birth-marks,where effects are produced by the involuntary agency of the maternal imaginationunder a state of excitement. The fact that the mother can control the appearanceof her unborn child was so well known among the ancients, that it was the customamong wealthy Greeks to place fine statues near the bed, so that she might havea perfect model constantly before her eyes. The cunning trick by which theHebrew patriarch Jacob caused ring-streaked and speckled calves to be dropped,is an illustration of the law among animals; and Aricante tells \"of foursuccessive litters of puppies, born of healthy parents, some of which, in eachlitter, were well formed, whilst the remainder were without anterior extremitiesand had harelip.\" The works of Geoffroi St. Hilaire, Burdach, and Elam, containaccounts of great numbers of such cases, and in Dr. Prosper Lucas's importantvolume, Sur l'Heredite Naturelle, there are many. Elam quotes from Prichard aninstance where the child of a negro and white was marked with black and whitecolor upon separate parts of the body. He adds, with laudable sincerity, \"Theseare singularities of which, in the present state of science, no explanation canbe given.\" * It is a pity that his example was not more generally imitated.Among the ancients Empedocles, Aristotle, Pliny, Hippocrates, Galen, MarcusDamascenus, and others give us accounts quite as wonderful as our contemporaryauthors. In a work published in London, in 1659, ** a powerful argument is made inrefutation of the materialists by showing the potency of the human mind upon thesubtile forces of nature. The author, Dr. More, views the foetus as if it were aplastic substance, which can be fashioned by the mother to an agreeable ordisagreeable shape, to resemble some person or in part several persons, and tobe stamped with the effigies, or as we might more properly call it, astrograph,of some object vividly presented to her imagination. These effects may beproduced by her voluntarily or involuntarily, consciously or unconsciously,feebly or forcibly, as the case may be. It depends upon her ignorance orknowledge of the profound mysteries of nature. Taking women in the mass, themarking of the embryo may be considered more accidental than the result ofdesign; and as each person's atmosphere in the astral light is peopled with theimages of his or her immediate family, the sensitive surface of the foetus,which may almost be likened to the collodionized plate of a photograph, is aslikely as not to be stamped with the image of a near or remote ancestor, whomthe mother never saw, but which, at some critical moment, came as it were intothe focus of nature's camera. Says Dr. Elam, \"Near me is seated a visitor from adistant continent, where she was born and educated. The portrait of a remoteancestress, far back in the last century, hangs upon the wall. In every feature,one is an accurate presentment of the other, although the one never leftEngland, and the other was an American by birth and half parentage.\" The power of the imagination upon our physical condition, even after we arriveat maturity, is evinced in many familiar ways. In medicine, the intelligentphysician does not hesitate to accord to it a curative or morbific potencygreater than his pills and potions. He calls it the vis medicatrix naturae, andhis first endeavor is to gain the confidence of his patient so completely, thathe can cause nature to extirpate the disease. Fear often kills; and grief hassuch a power over the subtile fluids of the body as not only to derange theinternal organs but even to turn the hair white. Ficinus mentions the signatureof the foetus with the marks of cherries and various fruits, colors, hairs, andexcrescences, and acknowledges that the imagination of the mother may transformit into a resemblance of an ape, pig, or dog, or any such animal. MarcusDamascenus tells of a girl covered with hair and, like our modern JuliaPastrana, furnished with a full beard; Gulielmus Paradinus, of a child whoseskin and nails resembled those of a bear; Balduinus Ronsaeus of one born with aturkey's wattles; Pareus, of one with a head like a frog; and Avicenna, ofchickens with hawks' heads. In this latter case, which perfectly exemplifies thepower of the same imagination in animals, the embryo must have been stamped atthe instant of conception when the hen's imagination saw a hawk either in factor in fancy. This is evident, for Dr. More, who quotes this case on theauthority of Avicenna, remarks very appropriately that, as the egg in questionmight have been hatched a hundred miles distant from the hen, the microscopicpicture of the hawk impressed upon the embryo must have enlarged and perfecteditself with the growth of the chicken quite independently of any subsequentinfluence from the hen. Cornelius Gemma tells of a child that was born with his forehead wounded andrunning with blood, the result of his father's threats toward his mother \" . . .with a drawn sword which he directed toward her forehead\"; Sennertius recordsthe case of a pregnant woman who, seeing a butcher divide a swine's head withhis cleaver, brought forth her child with his face cloven in the upper jaw, thepalate, and upper lip to the very nose. In Van Helmont's De InjectisMaterialibus, some very astonishing cases are reported: The wife of a tailor atMechlin was standing at her door and saw a soldier's hand cut off in a quarrel,which so impressed her as to bring on premature labor, and her child was bornwith only one hand, the other arm bleeding. In 1602, the wife of MarcusDevogeler, a merchant of Antwerp, seeing a soldier who had just lost his arm,was taken in labor and brought forth a daughter with one arm struck off andbleeding as in the first case. Van Helmont gives a third example of anotherwoman who witnessed the beheading of thirteen men by order of the Duc d'Alva.The horror of the spectacle was so overpowering that she \"suddainly fell intolabour and brought forth a perfectly-formed infant, only the head was wanting,but the neck bloody as their bodies she beheld that had their heads cut off. Andthat which does still advance the wonder is, that the hand, arme, and head ofthese infants were none of them to be found.\" * If it was possible to conceive of such a thing as a miracle in nature, the abovecases of the sudden disappearance of portions of the unborn human body might bedesignated. We have looked in vain through the latest authorities upon humanphysiology for any sufficient theory to account for the least remarkable offoetal signatures. The most they can do is to record instances of what they call\"spontaneous varieties of type,\" and then fall back either upon Mr. Proctor's\"curious coincidences\" or upon such candid confessions of ignorance as are to befound in authors not entirely satisfied with the sum of human knowledge.Magendie acknowledges that, despite scientific researches, comparatively littleis known of foetal life. At page 518 of the American edition of his PrecisElementaire de Physiologie he instances \"a case where the umbilical cord wasruptured and perfectly cicatrized\"; and asks \"How was the circulation carried onin this organ?\" On the next page, he says: \"Nothing is at present knownrespecting the use of digestion in the foetus\"; and respecting its nutrition,propounds this query: \"What, then, can we say of the nutrition of the foetus?Physiological works contain only vague conjectures on this point.\" On page 520,the following language occurs: \"In consequence of some unknown cause, thedifferent parts of the foetus sometimes develop themselves in a preternaturalmanner.\" With singular inconsistency with his previous admissions of theignorance of science upon all these points which we have quoted, he adds: \"Thereis no reason for believing that the imagination of the mother can have anyinfluence in the formation of these monsters; besides, productions of this kindare daily observed in the offspring of other animals and even in plants.\" Howperfect an illustration is this of the methods of scientific men!--the momentthey pass beyond their circle of observed facts, their judgment seems to becomeentirely perverted. Their deductions from their own researches are often greatlyinferior to those made by others who have to take the facts at second hand. The literature of science is constantly furnishing examples of this truth; andwhen we consider the reasoning of materialistic observers upon psychologicalphenomena, the rule is strikingly manifest. Those who are soul-blind are asconstitutionally incapable of distinguishing psychological causes from materialeffects as the color-blind are to select scarlet from black. Elam, without being in the least a spiritualist, nay, though an enemy to it,represents the belief of honest scientists in the following expressions: \"it iscertainly inexplicable how matter and mind can act and react one upon the other;the mystery is acknowledged by all to be insoluble, and will probably everremain so.\" The great English authority upon the subject of malformation is The Science andPractice of Medicine, by Wm. Aitken, M. D., Edinburgh, and Professor ofPathology in the Army Medical School; the American edition of which, byProfessor Meredith Clymer, M. D., of the University of Pennsylvania, has equalweight in the United States. At page 233 of vol. i. we find the subject treatedat length. The author says, \"The superstition, absurd notions, and strangecauses assigned to the occurrence of such malformations, are now fastdisappearing before the lucid expositions of those famous anatomists who havemade the development and growth of the ovum a subject of special study. It issufficient to mention here the names, J. Muller, Ratlike, Bischoff, St. Hilaire,Burdach, Allen Thompson, G. & W. Vrolick, Wolff, Meckel, Simpson, Rokitansky,and Von Ammon as sufficient evidence that the truths of science will in timedispel the mists of ignorance and superstition.\" One would think, from thecomplacent tone adopted by this eminent writer that we were in possession if notof the means of readily solving this intricate problem at least of a clew toguide us through the maze of our difficulties. But, in 1872, after profiting byall the labors and ingenuity of the illustrious pathologists above enumerated,we find him making the same confession of ignorance as that expressed byMagendie in 1838. \"Nevertheless,\" says he, \"much mystery still enshrouds theorigin of malformation; the origin of them may be considered in two main issues,namely: 1, are they due to original malformation of the germ? 2, or, are theydue to subsequent deformities of the embryo by causes operating on itsdevelopment? With regard to the first issue, it is believed that the germ may beoriginally malformed, or defective, owing to some influence proceeding eitherfrom the female, or from the male, as in case of repeated procreation of thesame kind of malformation by the same parents, deformities on either side beingtransmitted as an inheritance.\" Being unsupplied with any philosophy of their own to account for the lesions,the pathologists, true to professional instinct, resort to negation. \"That suchdeformity may be produced by mental impressions on pregnant women there is anabsence of positive proof,\" they say. \"Moles, mothers' marks, and cutaneousspots as ascribed to morbid states of the coats of the ovum. . . . A verygenerally-recognized cause of malformation consists in impeded development ofthe foetus, the cause of which is not always obvious, but is for the most partconcealed. . . . Transient forms of the human foetus are comparable topersistent forms of many lower animals.\" Can the learned professor explain why?\"Hence malformations resulting from arrest of development often acquire ananimal-like appearance.\" Exactly; but why do not pathologists inform us why it is so? Any anatomist whohas made the development and growth of the embryo and foetus \"a subject ofspecial study,\" can tell, without much brain-work, what daily experience and theevidence of his own eyes show him, viz.: that up to a certain period, the humanembryo is a fac-simile of a young batrachian in its first remove from thespawn--a tadpole. But no physiologist or anatomist seems to have had the idea ofapplying to the development of the human being--from the first instant of itsphysical appearance as a germ to its ultimate formation and birth--thePythagorean esoteric doctrine of metempsychosis, so erroneously interpreted bycritics. The meaning of the kabalistic axiom: \"A stone becomes a plant; a planta beast; a beast a man, etc.,\" was mentioned in another place in relation to thespiritual and physical evolution of man on this earth. We will now add a fewwords more to make the idea clearer. What is the primitive shape of the future man? A grain, a corpuscle, say somephysiologists; a molecule, an ovum of the ovum, say others. If it could beanalyzed--by the spectroscope or otherwise--of what ought we to expect to findit composed? Analogically, we should say, of a nucleus of inorganic matter,deposited from the circulation at the germinating point, and united with adeposit of organic matter. In other words, this infinitesimal nucleus of thefuture man is composed of the same elements as a stone--of the same elements asthe earth, which the man is destined to inhabit. Moses is cited by the kabalistsas authority for the remark, that it required earth and water to make a livingbeing, and thus it may be said that man first appears as a stone. At the end of three or four weeks the ovum has assumed a plant-like appearance,one extremity having become spheroidal and the other tapering, like a carrot.Upon dissection it is found to be composed, like an onion, of very delicatelaminae or coats, enclosing a liquid. The laminae approach each other at thelower end, and the embryo hangs from the root of the umbilicus almost like afruit from the bough. The stone has now become changed, by metempsychosis, intoa plant. Then the embryonic creature begins to shoot out, from the insideoutward, its limbs, and develops its features. The eyes are visible as two blackdots; the ears, nose, and mouth form depressions, like the points of apineapple, before they begin to project. The embryo develops into an animal-likefoetus--the shape of a tadpole--and like an amphibious reptile lives in water,and develops from it. Its monad has not yet become either human or immortal, forthe kabalists tell us that that only comes at the \"fourth hour.\" One by one thefoetus assumes the characteristics of the human being, the first flutter of theimmortal breath passes through his being; he moves; nature opens the way forhim; ushers him into the world; and the divine essence settles in the infantframe, which it will inhabit until the moment of physical death, when manbecomes a spirit. This mysterious process of a nine-months formation the kabalists call thecompletion of the \"individual cycle of evolution.\" As the foetus develops fromthe liquor amnii in the womb, so the earths germinate from the universal ether,or astral fluid, in the womb of the universe. These cosmic children, like theirpigmy inhabitants, are first nuclei; then ovules; then gradually mature; andbecoming mothers in their turn, develop mineral, vegetable, animal, and humanforms. From centre to circumference, from the imperceptible vesicle to theuttermost conceivable bounds of the cosmos, these glorious thinkers, thekabalists, trace cycle merging into cycle, containing and contained in anendless series. The embryo evolving in its pre-natal sphere, the individual inhis family, the family in the state, the state in mankind, the earth in oursystem, that system in its central universe, the universe in the cosmos, and thecosmos in the First Cause:--the Boundless and Endless. So runs their philosophyof evolution: \"All are but parts of one stupendous whole,Whose body Nature is; and God the Soul.\"\"Worlds without numberLie in this bosom like children.\"While unanimously agreeing that physical causes, such as blows, accidents, andbad quality of food for the mother, affect the foetus in a way which endangersits life; and while admitting again that moral causes, such as fear, suddenterror, violent grief, or even extreme joy, may retard the growth of the foetusor even kill it, many physiologists agree with Magendie in saying, \"there is noreason for believing that the imagination of the mother can have any influencein the formation of monsters\"; and only because \"productions of this kind aredaily observed in the production of other animals and even in plants.\" In this opinion he is supported by the leading teratologists of our day.Although Geoffroi St. Hilaire gave its name to the new science, its facts arebased upon the exhaustive experiments of Bichat, who, in 1802, was recognized asthe founder of analytical and philosophical anatomy. One of the most importantcontributions to teratological literature is the monograph of G. J. Fisher,M.D., of Sing Sing, N. Y., entitled Diploteratology; an Essay on Compound HumanMonsters. This writer classifies monstrous foetal growths into their genera andspecies, accompanying the cases with reflections suggested by theirpeculiarities. Following St. Hilaire, he divides the history of the subject intothe fabulous, the positive, and the scientific periods. It suffices for our purpose to say that in the present state of scientificopinion two points are considered as established: 1, that the maternal, mentalcondition has no influence in the production of monstrosities; 2, that mostvarieties of monstrosity may be accounted for on the theory of arrest andretardation of development. Says Fisher, \"By a careful study of the laws ofdevelopment and the order in which the various organs are evolved in the embryo,it has been observed that monsters by defect or arrest of development, are, to acertain extent, permanent embryos. The abnormal organs merely represent theprimitive condition of formation as it existed in an early stage of embryonic orfoetal life.\" * With physiology in so confessedly chaotic a state as it is atpresent, it seems a little like hardihood in any teratologist, however great hisachievements in anatomy, histology, or embryology, to take so dangerous aposition as that the mother has no influence upon her offspring. While themicroscopes of Haller and Prolik, Dareste and Laraboulet have disclosed to usmany interesting facts concerning the single or double primitive traces on thevitelline membrane, what remains undiscovered about embryology by modern scienceappears greater still. If we grant that monstrosities are the result of anarrest of development--nay, if we go farther, and concede that the foetal futuremay be prognosticated from the vitelline tracings, where will the teratologiststake us to learn the antecedent psychological cause of either? Dr. Fisher mayhave carefully studied some hundreds of cases, and feel himself authorized toconstruct a new classification of their genera and species; but facts are facts,and outside the field of his observation it appears, even if we judge but by ourown personal experience, in various countries, that there are abundantattainable proofs that the violent maternal emotions are often reflected intangible, visible, and permanent disfigurements of the child. And the cases inquestion seem, moreover, to contradict Dr. Fisher's assertion that monstrousgrowths are due to causes traceable to \"the early stages of embryonic or foetallife.\" One case was that of a Judge of an Imperial Court at Saratow, Russia, whoalways wore a bandage to cover a mouse-mark on the left side of his face. It wasa perfectly-formed mouse, whose body was represented in high relief upon thecheek, and the tail ran upward across the temple and was lost in his hair. Thebody seemed glossy, gray, and quite natural. According to his own account, hismother had an unconquerable repugnance to mice, and her labor was prematurelybrought on by seeing a mouse jump out from her workbox. In another instance, of which the writer was a witness, a pregnant lady, withintwo or three weeks of her accouchement, saw a bowl of raspberries, and wasseized with an irresistible longing for some, but denied. She excitedly claspedher right hand to her neck in a somewhat theatrical manner, and exclaimed thatshe must have them. The child born under our eyes, three weeks later, had aperfectly-defined raspberry on the right side of his neck; to this day, whenthat fruit ripens, his birth-mark becomes of a deep crimson, while, during thewinter, it is quite pale. Such cases as these, which are familiar to many mothers of families, either intheir personal experience or that of friends, carry conviction, despite thetheories of all the teratologists of Europe and America. Because, forsooth,animals and plants are observed to produce malformations of their species aswell as human beings, Magendie and his school infer that the human malformationsof an identical character are not at all due to maternal imagination, since theformer are not. If physical causes produce physical effects in the subordinatekingdoms, the inference is that the same rule must hold with ourselves. But an entirely original theory was broached by Professor Armor, of the LongIsland Medical College, in the course of a discussion recently held in theDetroit Academy of Medicine. In opposition to the orthodox views which Dr.Fisher represents, Professor Armor says that malformations result from eitherone of two causes--1, a deficiency or abnormal condition in the generativematter from which the foetus is developed, or 2, morbid influences acting on thefoetus in utero. He maintains that the generative matter represents in itscomposition every tissue, structure, and form, and that there may be such atransmission of acquired structural peculiarities as would make the generativematter incapable of producing a healthy and equally-developed offspring. On theother hand, the generative matter may be perfect in itself, but being subjectedto morbid influences during the process of gestation, the offspring will, ofnecessity, be monstrous. To be consistent, this theory must account for diploteratological cases(double-headed or double-membered monsters), which seems difficult. We might,perhaps, admit that in defective generative matter, the head of the embryo mightnot be represented, or any other part of the body be deficient; but, it hardlyseems as if there could be two, three, or more representatives of a singlemember. Again, if the generative matter have hereditary taint, it seems as ifall the resulting progeny should be equally monstrous; whereas the fact is thatin many cases the mother has given birth to a number of healthy children beforethe monster made its appearance, all being the progeny of one father. Numerouscases of this kind are quoted by Dr. Fisher; among others he cites the case ofCatherine Corcoran, * a \"very healthy woman, thirty years of age and who,previously to giving birth to this monster had born five well-formed children,no two of which were twins . . . it had a head at either extremity, two chests,with arms complete, two abdominal and two pelvic cavities united end to end,with four legs placed two at either side, where the union between the twooccurred.\" Certain parts of the body, however, were not duplicated, andtherefore this cannot be claimed as a case of the growing together of twins. Another instance is that of Maria Teresa Parodi. ** This woman, who hadpreviously given birth to eight well-formed children, was delivered of a femaleinfant the upper part of which only was double. Instances in which before andafter the production of a monster the children were perfectly healthy arenumerous, and if, on the other hand, the fact that monstrosities are as commonwith animals as they are with mankind is a generally-accepted argument againstthe popular theory that these malformations are due to the imagination of themother; and that other fact--that there is no difference between the ovariancell of a mammifer and man, be admitted, what becomes of Professor Armor'stheory? In such a case an instance of an animal-malformation is as good as thatof a human monster; and this is what we read in Dr. Samuel L. Mitchell's paperOn two-headed Serpents: \"A female snake was killed, together with her wholebrood of young ones, amounting to 120, of these three were monsters. One withtwo distinct heads; one with a double head and only three eyes; and one with adouble skull, furnished with three eyes, and a single lower jaw; this last hadtwo bodies.\" * Surely the generative matter which produced these three monsterswas identical with that which produced the other 117? Thus the Armor theory isas imperfect as all the rest. The trouble proceeds from the defective method of reasoning usuallyadopted--Induction; a method which claims to collect by experiment andobservation all the facts within its reach, the former being rather that ofcollecting and examining experiments and drawing conclusions therefrom; and,according to the author of Philosophical Inquiry, \"as this conclusion cannot beextended beyond what is warranted by the experiments, the Induction is aninstrument of proof and limitation.\" Notwithstanding this limitation is to befound in every scientific inquiry, it is rarely confessed, but hypotheses areconstructed for us as though the experimenters had found them to bemathematically-proved theorems, while they are, to say the most, simpleapproximations. For a student of occult philosophy, who rejects in his turn the method ofinduction on account of these perpetual limitations, and fully adopts thePlatonic division of causes--namely, the Efficient, the Formal, the Material,and the Final, as well as the Eleatic method of examining any given proposition,it is but natural to reason from the following stand-point of the Neo-platonicschool: 1. The subject either is as it is supposed or is not. Therefore we willinquire: Does the universal ether, known by the kabalists as the \"astral light,\"contain electricity and magnetism, or does it not? The answer must be in theaffirmative, for \"exact science\" herself teaches us that these two convertibleagents saturating both the air and the earth, there is a constant interchange ofelectricity and magnetism between them. The question No. 1 being settled, wewill have now to examine what happens--1st. To it with respect to itself. 2d. Toit with respect to all other things. 3d. With all other things, with respect toit. 4th. To all other things with respect to themselves. ANSWERS: 1st. With respect to itself. That inherent properties previously latentin electricity, become active under favoring conditions; and that at one timethe form of magnetic force is assumed by the subtile, all-pervading agent; atanother, the form of electric force is assumed. 2d. With respect to all other things. By all other things for which it has anaffinity, it is attracted, by all others repelled. 3d. With all other things with respect to it. It happens that whenever they comein contact with electricity, they receive its impress in proportion to theirconductivity. 4th. To all other things with respect to themselves. That under the impulsereceived from the electric force, and in proportion to its intensity, theirmolecules change their relations with each other; that either they are wrenchedasunder, so as to destroy the object--organic or inorganic--which they formed,or, if previously disturbed, are brought into equilibrium (as in cases ofdisease); or the disturbance may be but superficial, and the object may bestamped with the image of some other object encountered by the fluid beforereaching them. To apply the above propositions to the case in point: There are severalwell-recognized principles of science, as, for instance, that a pregnant womanis physically and mentally in a highly impressible state. Physiology tells usthat her intellectual faculties are weakened, and that she is affected to anunusual degree by the most trifling events. Her pores are opened, and she exudesa peculiar cutaneous perspiration; she seems to be in a receptive condition forall the influences in nature. Reichenbach's disciples assert that her odiccondition is very intense. Du Potet warns against incautiously mesmerizing her,for fear of affecting the offspring. Her diseases are imparted to it, and oftenit absorbs them entirely to itself; her pains and pleasures react upon itstemperament as well as its health; great men proverbially have great mothers,and vice versa. \"It is true that her imagination has an influence upon thefoetus,\" admits Magendie, thus contradicting what he asserts in another place;and he adds that \"sudden terror may cause the death of the foetus, or retard itsgrowth.\" * In the case recently reported in the American papers, of a boy who was killed bya stroke of lightning, upon stripping the body, there was found imprinted uponhis breast the faithful picture of a tree which grew near the window which hewas facing at the time of the catastrophe, and which was also felled by thelightning. Now, this electrical photography, which was accomplished by the blindforces of nature, furnishes an analogy by which we may understand how the mentalimages of the mother are transmitted to the unborn child. Her pores are opened;she exudes an odic emanation which is but another form of the akasa, theelectricity, or life-principle, and which, according to Reichenbach, producesmesmeric sleep, and consequently is magnetism. Magnetic currents developthemselves into electricity upon their exit from the body. An object making aviolent impression on the mother's mind, its image is instantly projected intothe astral light, or the universal ether, which Jevons and Babbage, as well asthe authors of the Unseen Universe, tell us is the repository of the spiritualimages of all forms, and even human thoughts. Her magnetic emanations attractand unite themselves with the descending current which already bears the imageupon it. It rebounds, and re-percussing more or less violently, impresses itselfupon the foetus, according to the very formula of physiology which shows howevery maternal feeling reacts on the offspring. Is this kabalistic theory morehypothetical or incomprehensible than the teratological doctrine taught by thedisciples of Geoffroi St. Hilaire? The doctrine, of which Magendie so justlyobserves, \"is found convenient and easy from its vagueness and obscurity,\" andwhich \"pretends to nothing less than the creation of a new science, the theoryof which reposes on certain laws not very intelligible, as that of arresting,that of retarding, that of similar or eccentric position, especially the greatlaw, as it is called, of self for self.\" * Eliphas Levi, who is certainly one of the best authorities on certain pointsamong kabalists, says: \"Pregnant women are, more than others, under theinfluence of the astral light, which assists in the formation of their child,and constantly presents to them the reminiscences of forms with which it isfilled. It is thus that very virtuous women deceive the malignity of observersby equivocal resemblances. They often impress upon the fruit of their marriagean image which has struck them in a dream, and thus are the same physiognomiesperpetuated from age to age. \"The kabalistic use of the pentagram can therefore determine the countenance ofunborn infants, and an initiated woman might give to her son the features ofNereus or Achilles, as well as those of Louis XV. or Napoleon.\" ** If it should confirm another theory than that of Dr. Fisher, he should be thelast to complain, for as he himself makes the confession, which his own exampleverifies: * \"One of the most formidable obstacles to the advancement of science. . . has ever been a blind submission to authority. . . . To untrammel the mindfrom the influence of mere authority, that it may have free scope in theinvestigation of facts and laws which exist and are established in nature, isthe grand antecedent necessary to scientific discovery and permanent progress.\" If the maternal imagination can stunt the growth or destroy the life of thefoetus, why cannot it influence its physical appearance? There are some surgeonswho have devoted their lives and fortunes to find the cause for thesemalformations, but have only reached the opinion that they are mere\"coincidences.\" It would be also highly unphilosophical to say that animals arenot endowed with imagination; and, while it might be considered the acme ofmetaphysical speculation to even formulate the idea that members of thevegetable kingdom--say the mimosas and the group of insect-catchers--have aninstinct and even rudimentary imagination of their own, yet the idea is notwithout its advocates. If great physicists like Tyndall are forced to confessthat even in the case of intelligent and speaking man they are unable to bridgethe chasm between mind and matter, and define the powers of the imagination, howmuch greater must be the mystery about what takes place in the brain of a dumbanimal. What is imagination? Psychologists tell us that it is the plastic or creativepower of the soul; but materialists confound it with fancy. The radicaldifference between the two, was however, so thoroughly indicated by Wordsworth,in the preface to his Lyrical Ballads, that it is no longer excusable tointerchange the words. Imagination, Pythagoras maintained to be the remembranceof precedent spiritual, mental, and physical states, while fancy is thedisorderly production of the material brain. From whatever aspect we view and question matter, the world-old philosophy thatit was vivified and fructified by the eternal idea, or imagination--the abstractoutlining and preparing the model for the concrete form--is unavoidable. If wereject this doctrine, the theory of a cosmos evolving gradually out of itschaotic disorder becomes an absurdity; for it is highly unphilosophical toimagine inert matter, solely moved by blind force, and directed by intelligence,forming itself spontaneously into a universe of such admirable harmony. If thesoul of man is really an outcome of the essence of this universal soul, aninfinitesimal fragment of this first creative principle, it must of necessitypartake in degree of all the attributes of the demiurgic power. As the creator,breaking up the chaotic mass of dead, inactive matter, shaped it into form, soman, if he knew his powers, could, to a degree, do the same. As Pheidias,gathering together the loose particles of clay and moistening them with water,could give plastic shape to the sublime idea evoked by his creative faculty, sothe mother who knows her power can fashion the coming child into whatever formshe likes. Ignorant of his powers, the sculptor produces only an inanimatethough ravishing figure of inert matter; while the soul of the mother, violentlyaffected by her imagination, blindly projects into the astral light an image ofthe object which impressed it, and, by re-percussion, that is stamped upon thefoetus. Science tells us that the law of gravitation assures us that anydisplacement which takes place in the very heart of the earth will be feltthroughout the universe, \"and we may even imagine that the same thing will holdtrue of those molecular motions which accompany thought.\" * Speaking of thetransmission of energy throughout the universal ether or astral light, the sameauthority says: \"Continual photographs of all occurrences are thus produced andretained. A large portion of the energy of the universe may thus be said to beinvested in such pictures.\" Dr. Fournie, of the National Deaf and Dumb Institute of France, in chapter ii.of his work, **. in discussing the question of the foetus, says that the mostpowerful microscope is unable to show us the slightest difference between theovarian cell of a mammifer and a man; and, respecting the first or last movementof the ovule, asks: \"What is it? has it particular characters which distinguishit from every other ovule?\" and justly answers thus: \"Until now, science has notreplied to these questions, and, without being a pessimist, I do not think thatshe ever will reply; from the day when her methods of investigation will permither to surprise the hidden mechanism of the conflict of the principle of lifewith matter, she will know life itself, and be able to produce it.\" If ourauthor had read the sermon of Pere Felix, how appropriately he might utter hisAmen! to the priest's exclamation--MYSTERY! MYSTERY! Let us consider the assertion of Magendie in the light of recorded instances ofthe power of imagination in producing monstrous deformities, where the questiondoes not involve pregnant women. He admits that these occur daily in theoffspring of the lower animals; how does he account for the hatching of chickenswith hawk-heads, except upon the theory that the appearance of the hereditaryenemy acted upon the hen's imagination, which, in its turn, imparted to thematter composing the germ a certain motion which, before expanding itself,produced the monstrous chicks? We know of an analogous case, where a tame dove,belonging to a lady of our acquaintance, was frightened daily by a parrot, andin her next brood of young there were two squabs with parrots' heads, theresemblance even extending to the color of the feathers. We might also citeColumella, Youatt, and other authorities, together with the experience of allanimal breeders, to show that by exciting the imagination of the mother, theexternal appearance of the offspring can be largely controlled. These instancesin no degree affect the question of heredity, for they are simply specialvariations of type artificially caused. Catherine Crowe discusses at considerable length the question of the power ofthe mind over matter, and relates, in illustration, many well-authenticatedinstances of the same. * Among others, that most curious phenomenon called thestigmata have a decided bearing upon this point. These marks come upon thebodies of persons of all ages, and always as the result of exalted imagination.In the cases of the Tyrolese ecstatic, Catherine Emmerich, and many others, thewounds of the crucifixion are said to be as perfect as nature. A certain Mme. B.von N. dreamed one night that a person offered her a red and a white rose, andthat she chose the latter. On awaking, she felt a burning pain in her arm, andby degrees there appeared the figure of a rose, perfect in form and color; itwas rather raised above the skin. The mark increased in intensity till theeighth day, after which it faded away, and by the fourteenth, was no longerperceptible. Two young ladies, in Poland, were standing by an open window duringa storm; a flash of lightning fell near them, and the gold necklace on the neckof one of them was melted. A perfect image of it was impressed upon the skin,and remained throughout life. The other girl, appalled by the accident to hercompanion, stood transfixed with horror for several minutes, and then faintedaway. Little by little the same mark of a necklace as had been instantaneouslyimprinted upon her friend's body, appeared upon her own, and remained there forseveral years, when it gradually disappeared. Dr. Justinus Kerner, the distinguished German author, relates a still moreextraordinary case. \"At the time of the French invasion, a Cossack havingpursued a Frenchman into a cul-de-sac, an alley without an outlet, there ensueda terrible conflict between them, in which the latter was severely wounded. Aperson who had taken refuge in this close, and could not get away, was sodreadfully frightened, that when he reached home there broke out on his body thevery same wounds that the Cossack had inflicted on his enemy!\" In this case, as in those where organic disorders, and even physical deathresult from a sudden excitement of the mind reacting upon the body, Magendiewould find it difficult to attribute the effect to any other cause than theimagination; and if he were an occultist, like Paracelsus, or Van Helmont, thequestion would be stripped of its mystery. He would understand the power of thehuman will and imagination--the former conscious, the latter involuntary--on theuniversal agent to inflict injury, physical and mental, not only upon chosenvictims, but also, by reflex action, upon one's self and unconsciously. It isone of the fundamental principles of magic, that if a current of this subtilefluid is not impelled with sufficient force to reach the objective point, itwill react upon the individual sending it, as an India-rubber ball rebounds tothe thrower's hand from the wall against which it strikes without being able topenetrate it. There are many cases instanced where would-be sorcerers fellvictims themselves. Van Helmont says: \"The imaginative power of a woman vividlyexcited produces an idea, which is the connecting medium between the body andspirit. This transfers itself to the being with whom the woman stands in themost immediate relation, and impresses upon it that image which the mostagitated herself.\" Deleuze has collected, in his Bibliotheque du Magnetisme Animal, a number ofremarkable facts taken from Van Helmont, among which we will content ourselveswith quoting the following as pendants to the case of the bird-hunter, JacquesPelissier. He says that \"men by looking steadfastly at animals oculis intentisfor a quarter of an hour may cause their death; which Rousseau confirms from hisown experience in Egypt and the East, as having killed several toads in thismanner. But when he at last tried this at Lyons, the toad, finding it could notescape from his eye, turned round, blew itself up, and stared at him sofiercely, without moveing its eyes, that a weakness came over him even tofainting, and he was for some time thought to be dead.\" But to return to the question of teratology. Wierus tells, in his De PraestigiisDemonum, of a child born of a woman who not long before its birth was threatenedby her husband, he saying that she had the devil in her and that he would killhim. The mother's fright was such that her offspring appeared \"well-shaped fromthe middle downward, but upward spotted with blackened red spots, with eyes inhis forehead, a mouth like a Satyr, ears like a dog, and bended horns on itshead like a goat.\" In a demonological work by Peramatus, there is a story of amonster born at St. Lawrence, in the West Indies, in the year 1573, thegenuineness of which is certified to by the Duke of Medina-Sidonia. The child,\"besides the horrible deformity of its mouth, ears, and nose, had two horns onthe head, like those of young goats, long hair on his body, a fleshy girdleabout his middle, double, from whence hung a piece of flesh like a purse, and abell of flesh in his left hand like those the Indians use when they dance, whiteboots of flesh on his legs, doubled down. In brief, the whole shape was horridand diabolical, and conceived to proceed from some fright the mother had takenfrom the antic dances of the Indians.\" * Dr. Fisher rejects all such instancesas unauthenticated and fabulous. But we will not weary the reader with further selections from the multitude ofteratological cases to be found recorded in the works of standard authors; theabove suffice to show that there is reason to attribute these aberrations ofphysiological type to the mutual reaction of the maternal mind and the universalether upon each other. Lest some should question the authority of Van Helmont,as a man of science, we will refer them to the work of Fournie, the well-knownphysiologist, where (at page 717) the following estimate of his character willbe found: \"Van Helmont was a highly distinguished chemist; he had particularlystudied aeriform fluids, and gave them the name of gaz; at the same time hepushed his piety to mysticism, abandoning himself exclusively to a contemplationof the divinity. . . . Van Helmont is distinguished above all his predecessorsby connecting the principle of life, directly and in some sort experimentally,as he tells us, with the most minute movements of the body. It is the incessantaction of this entity, in no way associated by him with the material elements,but forming a distinct individuality, that we cannot understand. Nevertheless,it is upon this entity that a famous school has laid its principal foundation.\" Van Helmont's \"principle of life,\" or archaeus, is neither more nor less thanthe astral light of all the kabalists, and the universal ether of modernscience. If the more unimportant signatures of the foetus are not due to theimagination of the mother, to what other cause would Magendie attribute theformation of horny scales, the horns of goats and the hairy coats of animals,which we have seen in the above instances marking monstrous progeny? Surelythere were no latent germs of these distinguishing features of the animalkingdom capable of being developed under a sudden impulse of the maternal fancy.In short, the only possible explanation is the one offered by the adepts in theoccult sciences. Before leaving the subject, we wish to say a few words more respecting the caseswhere the head, arm, and hand were instantly dissolved, though it was evidentthat in each instance the entire body of the child had been perfectly formed. Ofwhat is a child's body composed at its birth? The chemists will tell us that itcomprises a dozen pounds of solidified gas, and a few ounces of ashy residuum,some water, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, a little lime, magnesia,phosphorus, and a few other minerals; that is all! Whence came they? How werethey gathered together? How were these particles which Mr. Proctor tells us aredrawn in from \"the depths of space surrounding us on all sides,\" formed andfashioned into the human being? We have seen that it is useless to ask thedominant school of which Magendie is an illustrious representative; for heconfesses that they know nothing of the nutrition, digestion, or circulation ofthe foetus; and physiology teaches us that while the ovule is enclosed in theGraafian vesicle it participates--forms an integral part of the generalstructure of the mother. Upon the rupture of the vesicle, it becomes almost asindependent of her for what is to build up the body of the future being as thegerm in a bird's egg after the mother has dropped it in the nest. Therecertainly is very little in the demonstrated facts of science to contradict theidea that the relation of the embryonic child to the mother is much differentfrom that of the tenant to the house, upon whose shelter he depends for health,warmth, and comfort. According to Demokritus, the soul * results from the aggregation of atoms, andPlutarch describes his philosophy as follows: \"That there are substancesinfinite in number, indivisible, undisturbed, which are without differences,without qualities, and which move in space, where they are disseminated; thatwhen they approach each other, they unite, interlock, and form by theiraggregation water, fire, a plant, or a man. That all these substances, which hecalls atoms by reason of their solidity, can experience neither change noralteration. But,\" adds Plutarch, \"we cannot make a color of that which iscolorless, nor a substance or soul of that which is without soul and withoutquality.\" Professor Balfour Stewart says that this doctrine, in the hands ofJohn Dalton, \"has enabled the human mind to lay hold of the laws which regulatechemical changes, as well as to picture to itself what is there taking place.\"After quoting, with approbation, Bacon's idea that men are perpetuallyinvestigating the extreme limits of nature, he then erects a standard which heand his brother philosophers would do well to measure their behavior by. \"Surelywe ought,\" says he, \"to be very cautious before we dismiss any branch ofknowledge or train of thought as essentially unprofitable.\" ** Brave words, these. But how many are the men of science who put them intopractice? Demokritus of Abdera shows us space crammed with atoms, and ourcontemporary astronomers allow us to see how these atoms form into worlds, andafterward into the races, our own included, which people them. Since we haveindicated the existence of a power in the human will, which, by concentratingcurrents of those atoms upon an objective point, can create a childcorresponding to the mother's fancy, why is it not perfectly credible that thissame power put forth by the mother, can, by an intense, albeit unconsciousreversal of those currents, dissipate and obliterate any portion or even thewhole of the body of her unborn child? And here comes in the question of falsepregnancies, which have so often completely puzzled both physician and patient.If the head, arm, and hand of the three children mentioned by Van Helmont coulddisappear, as a result of the emotion of horror, why might not the same or someother emotion, excited in a like degree, cause the entire extinction of thefoetus in so-called false pregnancy? Such cases are rare, but they do occur, andmoreover baffle science completely. There certainly is no chemical solvent inthe mother's circulation powerful enough to dissolve her child, withoutdestroying herself. We commend the subject to the medical profession, hopingthat as a class they will not adopt the conclusion of Fournie, who says: \"Inthis succession of phenomena we must confine ourselves to the office ofhistorian, as we have not even tried to explain the whys and wherefores of thesethings, for there lie the inscrutable mysteries of life, and in proportion as weadvance in our exposition, we will be obliged to recognize that this is to usforbidden ground.\" * Within the limits of his intellectual capabilities the true philosopher knows noforbidden ground, and should be content to accept no mystery of nature asinscrutable or inviolable. No student of Hermetic philosophy, nor any spiritualist, will object to theabstract principle laid down by Hume that a miracle is impossible; for tosuppose such a possibility would make the universe governed through specialinstead of general laws. This is one of the fundamental contradictions betweenscience and theology. The former, reasoning upon universal experience, maintainsthat there is a general uniformity of the course of nature, while the latterassumes that the Governing Mind can be invoked to suspend general law to suitspecial emergencies. Says John Stuart Mill, ** \"If we do not already believe insupernatural agencies, no miracle can prove to us their existence. The miracleitself, considered merely as an extraordinary fact, may be satisfactorilycertified by our senses or by testimony; but nothing can ever prove that it is amiracle. There is still another possible hypothesis, that of its being the result of someunknown natural cause; and this possibility cannot be so completely shut out asto leave no alternative but that of admitting the existence and intervention ofa being superior to nature.\" This is the very point which we have sought to bring home to our logicians andphysicists. As Mr. Mill himself says, \"We cannot admit a proposition as a law ofnature, and yet believe a fact in real contradiction to it. We must disbelievethe alleged fact, or believe that we were mistaken in admitting the supposedlaw.\" Mr. Hume cites the \"firm and unalterable experience\" of mankind, asestablishing the laws whose operation ipso facto makes miracles impossible. Thedifficulty lies in his use of the adjective which is Italicized, for this is anassumption that our experience will never change, and that, as a consequence, wewill always have the same experiments and observations upon which to base ourjudgment. It also assumes that all philosophers will have the same facts toreflect upon. It also entirely ignores such collected accounts of philosophicalexperiment and scientific discovery as we may have been temporarily deprived of.Thus, by the burning of the Alexandrian Library and the destruction of Nineveh,the world has been for many centuries without the necessary data upon which toestimate the real knowledge, esoteric and exoteric, of the ancients. But, withinthe past few years, the discovery of the Rosetta stone, the Ebers, d'Aubigney,Anastasi, and other papyri, and the exhumation of the tile-libraries, haveopened a field of archaeological research which is likely to lead to radicalchanges in this \"firm and unalterable experience.\" The author of SupernaturalReligion justly observes that \"a person who believes anything contradictory to acomplete induction, merely on the strength of an assumption which is incapableof proof, is simply credulous; but such an assumption cannot affect the realevidence for that thing.\" In a lecture delivered by Mr. Hiram Corson, Professor of Anglo-Saxon Literatureat the Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y., before the alumni of St. John'sCollege, Annapolis, in July, 1875, the lecturer thus deservedly rebukes science: \"There are things,\" he says, \"which Science can never do, and which it isarrogant in attempting to do. There was a time when Religion and the Church wentbeyond their legitimate domain, and invaded and harried that of Science, andimposed a burdensome tribute upon the latter; but it would seem that theirformer relations to each other are undergoing an entire change, and Science hascrossed its frontiers and is invading the domain of Religion and the Church, andinstead of a Religious Papacy, we are in danger of being brought under aScientific Papacy--we are in fact already brought under such a Papacy; and as inthe sixteenth century a protest was made, in the interests of intellectualfreedom, against a religious and ecclesiastical despotism, so, in thisnineteenth century, the spiritual and eternal interests of man demand that aprotest should be made against a rapidly-developing scientific despotism, andthat Scientists should not only keep within their legitimate domain of thephenomenal and the conditioned, but should 'reexamine their stock in trade, sothat we may make sure how far the stock of bullion in the cellar--on the faithof whose existence so much paper has been circulating--is really the solid goldof Truth.' \"If this is not done in science as well as in ordinary business, scientists areapt to put their capital at too high a figure, and accordingly carry on adangerously-inflated business. Even since Prof. Tyndall delivered his BelfastAddress, it has been shown, by the many replies it has elicited, that thecapital of the Evolution-School of Philosophy to which he belongs, is not nearlyso great as it was before vaguely supposed to be by many of the non-scientificbut intelligent portion of the world. It is quite surprising to a non-scientificperson to be made aware of the large purely hypothetical domain which surroundsthat of established science, and of which scientists often boast, as a part oftheir settled and available conquests.\" Exactly; and at the same time denying the same privilege to others. They protestagainst the \"miracles\" of the Church, and repudiate, with as much logic, modernphenomena. In view of the admission of such scientific authorities as Dr.Youmans and others that modern science is passing through a transitional period,it would seem that it is time that people should cease to consider certainthings incredible only because they are marvellous, and because they seem tooppose themselves to what we are accustomed to consider universal laws. Thereare not a few well-meaning men in the present century who, desiring to avengethe memory of such martyrs of science as Agrippa, Palissy, and Cardan,nevertheless fail, through lack of means, to understand their ideas rightly.They erroneously believe that the Neo-platonists gave more attention totranscendental philosophy than to exact science. \"The failures that Aristotle himself so often exhibits,\" remarks ProfessorDraper, \"are no proof of the unreliability of his method, but rather of itstrustworthiness. They are failures arising from want of a sufficiency offacts.\" * What facts? we might inquire. A man of science cannot be expected to admit thatthese facts can be furnished by occult science, since he does not believe in thelatter. Nevertheless, the future may demonstrate this verity. Aristotle hasbequeathed his inductive method to our scientists; but until they supplement itwith \"the universals of Plato,\" they will experience still more \"failures\" thanthe great tutor of Alexander. The universals are a matter of faith only so longas they cannot be demonstrated by reason and based on uninterrupted experience.Who of our present-day philosophers can prove by this same inductive method thatthe ancients did not possess such demonstrations as a consequence of theiresoteric studies? Their own negations, unsupported as they are by proof,sufficiently attest that they do not always pursue the inductive method they somuch boast of. Obliged as they are to base their theories, nolens volens, on thegroundwork of the ancient philosophers, their modern discoveries are but theshoots put forth by the germs planted by the former. And yet even thesediscoveries are generally incomplete, if not abortive. Their cause is involvedin obscurity and their ultimate effect unforeseen. \"We are not,\" says ProfessorYoumans, \"to regard past theories as mere exploded errors, nor present theoriesas final. The living and growing body of truth has only mantled its oldinteguments in the progress to a higher and more vigorous state.\" * Thislanguage, applied to modern chemistry by one of the first philosophical chemistsand most enthusiastic scientific writers of the day, shows the transitionalstate in which we find modern science; but what is true of chemistry is true ofall its sister sciences. Since the advent of spiritualism, physicians and pathologists are more readythan ever to treat great philosophers like Paracelsus and Van Helmont assuperstitious quacks and charlatans, and to ridicule their notions about thearchaeus, or anima mundi, as well as the importance they gave to a knowledge ofthe machinery of the stars. And yet, how much of substantial progress hasmedicine effected since the days when Lord Bacon classed it among theconjectural sciences? Such philosophers as Demokritus, Aristotle, Euripides, Epicurus, or rather hisbiographer, Lucretius, AEschylus, and other ancient writers, whom thematerialists so willingly quote as authoritative opponents of the dreamyPlatonists, were only theorists, not adepts. The latter, when they did write,either had their works burned by Christian mobs or they worded them in a way tobe intelligible only to the initiated. Who of their modern detractors canwarrant that he knows all about what they knew? Diocletian alone burned wholelibraries of works upon the \"secret arts\"; not a manuscript treating on the artof making gold and silver escaped the wrath of this unpolished tyrant. Arts andcivilization had attained such a development at what is now termed the archaicages that we learn, through Champollion, that Athothi, the second king of thefirst dynasty, wrote a work on anatomy, and the king Necho on astrology andastronomy. Blantasus and Cynchrus were two learned geographers of thosepre-Mosaic days. AElian speaks of the Egyptian Iachus, whose memory wasvenerated for centuries for his wonderful achievements in medicine. He stoppedthe progress of several epidemics, merely with certain fumigations. A work ofApollonides, surnamed Orapios, is mentioned by Theophilus, patriarch of Antioch,entitled the Divine Book, and giving the secret biography and origin of all thegods of Egypt; and Ammianus Marcellinus speaks of a secret work in which wasnoted the precise age of the bull Apis--a key to many a mystery and cycliccalculation. What has become of all these books, and who knows the treasures oflearning they may have contained? We know but one thing for a certainty, andthat is, that Pagan and Christian Vandals destroyed such literary treasureswherever they could find them; and that the emperor Alexander Severus went allover Egypt to collect the sacred books on mysticism and mythology, pillagingevery temple; and that the Ethiopians--old as were the Egyptians in arts andsciences--claimed a priority of antiquity as well as of learning over them; aswell they might, for they were known in India at the earliest dawn of history.We also know that Plato learned more secrets in Egypt than he was allowed tomention; and that, according to Champollion, all that is really good andscientific in Aristotle's works--so prized in our day by our moderninductionists--is due to his divine Master; and that, as a logical sequence,Plato having imparted the profound secrets he had learned from the priests ofEgypt to his initiated disciples orally--who in their turn passed it from onegeneration to another of adepts--the latter know more of the occult powers ofnature than our philosophers of the present day. And here we may as well mention the works of Hermes Trismegistus. Who, or howmany have had the opportunity to read them as they were in the Egyptiansanctuaries? In his Egyptian Mysteries, Iamblichus attributes to Hermes 1,100books, and Seleucus reckons no less than 20,000 of his works before the periodof Menes. Eusebius saw but forty-two of these \"in his time,\" he says, and thelast of the six books on medicine treated on that art as practiced in thedarkest ages; * and Diodorus says that it was the oldest of the legislatorsMnevis, the third successor of Menes, who received them from Hermes. Of such manuscripts as have descended to us, most are but Latin retranslationsof Greek translations, made principally by the Neo-platonists from the originalbooks preserved by some adepts. Marcilius Ficinus, who was the first to publishthem in Venice, in 1488, has given us mere extracts, and the most importantportions seemed to have been either overlooked, or purposely omitted as toodangerous to publish in those days of Auto da fe. And so it happens now, thatwhen a kabalist who has devoted his whole life to studying occultism, and hasconquered the great secret, ventures to remark that the Kabala alone leads tothe knowledge of the Absolute in the Infinite, and the Indefinite in the Finite,he is laughed at by those who because they know the impossibility of squaringthe circle as a physical problem, deny the possibility of its being done in themetaphysical sense. Psychology, according to the greatest authorities on the subject, is adepartment of science hitherto almost unknown. Physiology, according to Fournie,one of its French authorities, is in so bad a condition as to warrant his sayingin the preface to his erudite work Physiologie du Systeme Nerveux, that \"weperceive at last that not only is the physiology of the brain not worked out,but also that no physiology whatever of the nervous system exists.\" Chemistryhas been entirely remodelled within the past few years; therefore, like all newsciences, the infant cannot be considered as very firm on its legs. Geology hasnot yet been able to tell anthropology how long man has existed. Astronomy, themost exact of sciences, is still speculating and bewildered about cosmic energy,and many other things as important. In anthropology, Mr. Wallace tells us, thereexists a wide difference of opinion on some of the most vital questionsrespecting the nature and origin of man. Medicine has been pronounced by variouseminent physicians to be nothing better than scientific guess-work. Everywhereincompleteness, nowhere perfection. When we look at these earnest men gropingaround in the dark to find the missing links of their broken chains, they seemto us like persons starting from a common, fathomless abyss by divergent paths.Each of these ends at the brink of a chasm which they cannot explore. On the onehand they lack the means to descend into its hidden depths, and on the otherthey are repulsed at each attempt by jealous sentries, who will not let thempass. And so they go on watching the lower forces of nature and from time totime initiating the public into their great discoveries. Did they not actuallypounce upon vital force and catch her playing in her game of correlation withchemical and physical forces? Indeed they did. But if we ask them whence thisvital force? How is it that they who had so firmly believed, but a short timesince, that matter was destructible and passed out of existence, and now havelearned to believe as firmly that it does not, are unable to tell us more aboutit? Why are they forced in this case as in many others to return to a doctrinetaught by Demokritus twenty-four centuries ago? * Ask them, and they willanswer: \"Creation or destruction of matter, increase or diminution of matter,lies beyond the domain of science . . . her domain is confined entirely to thechanges of matter . . . the domain of science lies within the limits of thesechanges--creation and annihilation lie outside of her domain.\" ** Ah! no, theylie only outside the grasp of materialistic scientists. But why affirm the sameof science? And if they say that \"force is incapable of destruction, except bythe same power which created it,\" then they tacitly admit the existence of sucha power, and have therefore no right to throw obstacles in the way of those who,bolder than themselves, try to penetrate beyond, and find that they can only doso by lifting the Veil of Isis. But, surely among all these inchoate branches of science, there must be some oneat least complete! It seems to us that we heard a great clamor of applause, \"asthe voice of many waters,\" over the discovery of protoplasm. But, alas! when weturned to read Mr. Huxley, the learned parent of the new-born infant is foundsaying: \"In perfect strictness, it is true that chemical investigation can tellus little or nothing, directly, of the composition of living matter, and . . .it is also in strictness, true, that WE KNOW NOTHING about the composition ofany body whatever, as it is!\" This is a sad confession, indeed. It appears, then, that the Aristotelian methodof induction is a failure in some cases, after all. This also seems to accountfor the fact that this model philosopher, with all his careful study ofparticulars before rising to universals, taught that the earth was in the centreof the universe; while Plato, who lost himself in the maze of Pythagorean\"vagaries,\" and started from general principles, was perfectly versed in theheliocentric system. We can easily prove the fact, by availing ourselves of thesaid inductive method for Plato's benefit. We know that the Sodalian oath of theinitiate into the Mysteries prevented his imparting his knowledge to the worldin so many plain words. \"It was the dream of his life,\" says Champollion, \"towrite a work and record in it in full the doctrines taught by the Egyptianhierophants; he often talked of it, but found himself compelled to abstain onaccount of the 'solemn oath.' \" And now, judging our modern-day philosophers on the vice versa method--namely,arguing from universals to particulars, and laying aside scientists asindividuals to merely give our opinion of them, viewed as a whole--we are forcedto suspect this highly respectable association of extremely petty feelingstoward their elder, ancient, and archaic brothers. It really seems as if theybore always in mind the adage, \"Put out the sun, and the stars will shine.\" We have heard a French Academician, a man of profound learning, remark, that hewould gladly sacrifice his own reputation to have the record of the manyridiculous mistakes and failures of his colleagues obliterated from the publicmemory. But these failures cannot be recalled too often in considering ourclaims and the subject we advocate. The time will come when the children of menof science, unless they inherit the soul-blindness of their skeptical parents,will be ashamed of the degrading materialism and narrow-mindedness of theirfathers. To use an expression of the venerable William Howitt, \"They hate newtruths as the owl and the thief hate the sun. . . . Mere intellectualenlightenment cannot recognize the spiritual. As the sun puts out a fire, sospirit puts out the eyes of mere intellect.\" It is an old, old story. From the days when the preacher wrote, \"the eye is notsatisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing,\" scientists havedeported themselves as if the saying were written to describe their own mentalcondition. How faithfully Lecky, himself a rationalist, unconsciously depictsthis propensity in men of science to deride all new things, in his descriptionof the manner in which \"educated men\" receive an account of a miracle havingtaken place! \"They receive it,\" says he, \"with an absolute and even derisiveincredulity, which dispenses with all examination of the evidences!\" Moreover,so saturated do they become with the fashionable skepticism after once havingfought their way into the Academy, that they turn about and enact the role ofpersecutors in their turn. \"It is a curiosity of science,\" says Howitt, \"thatBenjamin Franklin, who had himself experienced the ridicule of his countrymenfor his attempts to identify lightning and electricity, should have been one ofthe Committee of Savants, in Paris, in 1778, who examined the claims ofmesmerism, and condemned it as absolute quackery!\" * If men of science would confine themselves to the discrediting of newdiscoveries, there might be some little excuse for them on the score of theirtendency to a conservatism begotten of long habits of patient scrutiny; but theynot only set up claims to originality not warranted by fact, but contemptuouslydismiss all allegations that the people of ancient times knew as much and evenmore than themselves. Pity that in each of their laboratories there is notsuspended this text from Ecclesiastes: \"Is there anything whereof it may besaid, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was beforeus.\" ** In the verse which follows the one here quoted, the wise man says,\"There is no remembrance of former things\"; so that this utterance may accountfor every new denial. Mr. Meldrum may exact praise for his meteorologicalobservation of Cyclones in the Mauritius, and Mr. Baxendell, of Manchester, talklearnedly of the convection-currents of the earth, and Dr. Carpenter andCommander Maury map out for us the equatorial current, and Professor Henry showus how the moist wind deposits its burden to form rivulets and rivers, only tobe again rescued from the ocean and returned to the hill-tops--but hear whatKoheleth says: \"The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto thenorth; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according tohis circuits.\" *** \"All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full: unto the place fromwhence the rivers come, thither they return again.\" **** The philosophy of the distribution of heat and moisture by means of ascendingand descending currents between the equator and the poles, has a very recentorigin; but here has the hint been lying unnoticed in our most familiar book,for nearly three thousand years. And even now, in quoting it, we are obliged torecall the fact that Solomon was a kabalist, and in the above texts, simplyrepeats what was written thousands of years before his time. Cut off as they are from the accumulation of facts in one-half of the universe,and that the most important, modern scholars are naturally unable to construct asystem of philosophy which will satisfy themselves, let alone others. They arelike men in a coal mine, who work all day and emerge only at night, beingthereby unable to appreciate or understand the beauty and glory of the sunshine.Life to them measures the term of human activity, and the future presents totheir intellectual perception only an abyss of darkness. No hope of an eternityof research, achievement, and consequent pleasure, softens the asperities ofpresent existence; and no reward is offered for exertion but the bread-earningof to-day, and the shadowy and profitless fancy that their names may not beforgotten for some years after the grave has closed over their remains. Death tothem means extinction of the flame of life, and the dispersion of the fragmentsof the lamp over boundless space. Said Berzelius, the great chemist, at his lasthour, as he burst into tears: \"Do not wonder that I weep. You will not believeme a weak man, nor think I am alarmed by what the doctor has to announce to me.I am prepared for all. But I have to bid farewell to science; and you ought notto wonder that it costs me dear.\" * How bitter must be the reflections of such a great student of nature as this, tofind himself forcibly interrupted midway toward the accomplishment of some greatstudy, the construction of some great system, the discovery of some mysterywhich had baffled mankind for ages, but which the dying philosopher had daredhope that he might solve! Look at the world of science to-day, and see theatomic theorists, patching the tattered robes which expose the imperfections oftheir separate specialties! See them mending the pedestals upon which to set upagain the idols which had fallen from the places where they had been worshippedbefore this revolutionary theory had been exhumed from the tomb of Demokritus byJohn Dalton! In the ocean of material science they cast their nets, only to havethe meshes broken when some unexpected and monstrous problem comes their way.Its water is like the Dead Sea--bitter to the taste; so dense, that they canscarcely immerse themselves in it, much less dive to its bottom, having nooutlet, and no life beneath its waves, or along its margin. It is a dark,forbidding, trackless waste; yielding nothing worth the having, because what ityields is without life and without soul. There was a period of time when the learned Academics made themselvesparticularly merry at the simple enunciation of some marvels which the ancientsgave as having occurred under their own observations. What poor dolts--perhapsliars, these appeared in the eyes of an enlightened century! Did not theyactually describe horses and other animals, the feet of which presented someresemblance to the hands and feet of men? And in A.D. 1876, we hear Mr. Huxleygiving learned lectures in which the protohippus, rejoicing in a quasi-humanfore-arm, and the orohippus with his four toes and Eocene origin, and thehypothetical pedactyl equus, maternal grand-uncle of the present horse, play themost important part. The marvel is corroborated! Materialistic Pyrrhonists ofthe nineteenth century avenge the assertions of superstitious Platonists; theantediluvian gobe-mouches. And before Mr. Huxley, Geoffroi St. Hilaire has shownan instance of a horse which positively had fingers separated by membranes. *When the ancients spoke of a pigmy race in Africa, they were taxed withfalsehood. And yet, pigmies like these were seen and examined by a Frenchscientist during his voyage in the Tenda Maia, on the banks of the Rio Grande in1840; ** by Bayard Taylor at Cairo, in 1874; and by M. Bond, of the IndianTrigonometrical Survey, who discovered a wild dwarfish race, living in thehill-jungles of the western Galitz, to the southwest of the Palini Hills, arace, though often heard of, no trace of which had previously been found by thesurvey. \"This is a new pigmy race, resembling the African Obongos of du Chaillu,the Akkas of Schweinfurth, and the Dokos of Dr. Krapf, in their size,appearance, and habits.\" *** Herodotus was regarded as a lunatic for speaking of a people who he was toldslept during a night which lasted six months. If we explain the word \"slept\" byan easy misunderstanding it will be more than easy to account for the rest as anallusion to the night of the Polar Regions. **** Pliny has an abundance of factsin his work, which until very recently, were rejected as fables. Among others,he mentions a race of small animals, the males of which suckle their young ones.This assertion afforded much merriment among our savants. In his Report of theGeological Survey of the Territories, for 1872, Mr. C. H. Merriam describes arare and wonderful species of rabbit (Lepus Bairdi) inhabiting the pine-regionsabout the head-waters of the Wind and Yellowstone Rivers, in Wyoming. ***** Mr.Merriam secured five specimens of this animal, \"which . . . are the firstindividuals of the species that have been brought before the scientific world.One very curious fact is that all the males have teats, and take part insuckling their young! . . . Adult males had large teats full of milk, and thehair around the nipple of one was wet, and stuck to it, showing that, whentaken, he had been engaged in nursing his young.\" In the Carthaginian account ofthe early voyages of Hanno, ****** was found a long description of \"savagepeople . . . whose bodies were hairy and whom the interpreters called gorillae\";ανθροπον αγριον as the text reads, clearly implying thereby that these wild menwere monkeys. Until our present century, the statement was considered an idlestory, and Dodwell rejected altogether the authenticity of the manuscript andits contents. * The celebrated Atlantis is attributed by the latest moderncommentator and translator of Plato's works to one of Plato's \"noble lies.\" **Even the frank admission of the philosopher, in the Timaeus, that \"they say,that in their time . . . the inhabitants of this island (Poseidon) preserved atradition handed down by their ancestors concerning the existence of theAtlantic island of a prodigious magnitude . . . etc.\" *** does not save thegreat teacher from the imputation of falsehood, by the \"infallible modernschool.\" Among the great mass of peoples plunged deep in the superstitious ignorance ofthe mediaeval ages, there were but a few students of the Hermetic philosophy ofold, who, profiting by what it had taught them, were enabled to forecastdiscoveries which are the boast of our present age; while at the same time theancestors of our modern high-priests of the temple of the Holy Molecule, wereyet discovering the hoof-tracks of Satan in the simplest natural phenomenon.Says Professor A. Wilder: \"Roger Bacon (thirteenth century), in his treatise onthe Admirable Force of Art and Nature, devotes the first part of his work tonatural facts. He gives us hints of gunpowder and predicts the use of steam as apropelling power. The hydraulic press, the diving bell and kaleidoscope are alldescribed.\" **** The ancients speak of waters metamorphosed into blood; of blood-rain, ofsnow-storms during which the earth was covered to the extent of many miles withsnow of blood. This fall of crimson particles has been proved, like everythingelse, to be but a natural phenomenon. It has occurred at different epochs, butthe cause of it remains a puzzle until the present day. De Candolle, one of the most distinguished botanists of this century, sought toprove in 1825, at the time when the waters of the lake of Morat had apparentlyturned into a thick blood, that the phenomenon could be easily accounted for. Heattributed it to the development of myriads of those half-vegetable,half-infusory animals which he terms Oscellatoria rubescens, and which form thelink between animal and vegetable organisms. ***** Elsewhere we give an accountof the red snow which Captain Ross observed in the Arctic regions. Many memoirshave been written on the subject by the most eminent naturalists, but no two ofthem agree in their hypotheses. Some call it \"pollen powder of a species ofpine\"; others, small insects; and Professor Agardt confesses very frankly thathe is at a loss to either account for the cause of such phenomena, or to explainthe nature of the red substance. * The unanimous testimony of mankind is said to be an irrefutable proof of truth;and about what was ever testimony more unanimous than that for thousands of agesamong civilized people as among the most barbarous, there has existed a firm andunwavering belief in magic? The latter implies a contravention of the laws ofnature only in the minds of the ignorant; and if such ignorance is to bedeplored in the ancient uneducated nations, why do not our civilized andhighly-educated classes of fervent Christians, deplore it also in themselves?The mysteries of the Christian religion have been no more able to stand acrucial test than biblical miracles. Magic alone, in the true sense of the word,affords a clew to the wonders of Aaron's rod, and the feats of the magi ofPharaoh, who opposed Moses; and it does that without either impairing thegeneral truthfulness of the authors of the Exodus, or claiming more for theprophet of Israel than for others, or allowing the possibility of a singleinstance in which a \"miracle\" can happen in contravention of the laws of nature.Out of many \"miracles,\" we may select for our illustration that of the \"riverturned into blood.\" The text says: \"Take thy rod and stretch out thine hand(with the rod in it) upon the waters, streams, etc. . . . that they may becomeblood.\" We do not hesitate to say that we have seen the same thing repeatedly done on asmall scale, the experiment not having been applied to a river in these cases.From the time of Van Helmont, who, in the seventeenth century, despite theridicule to which he exposed himself, was willing to give the true directionsfor the so-called production of eels, frogs, and infusoria of various kinds,down to the champions of spontaneous generation of our own century, it has beenknown that such a quickening of germs is possible without calling in the aid ofmiracle to contravene natural law. The experiments of Pasteur and Spallanzani,and the controversy of the panspermists with the heterogenists--disciples ofBuffon, among them Needham--have too long occupied public attention to permit usto doubt that beings may be called into existence whenever there is air andfavorable conditions of moisture and temperature. The records of the officialmeetings of the Academy of Sciences of Paris ** contain accounts of frequentappearances of such showers of blood-red snow and water. These blood-spots werecalled lepra vestuum, and were but these lichen-infusoria. They were firstobserved in 786 and 959, in both of which years occurred great plagues. Whetherthese zoocarps were plants or animals is undetermined to this day, and nonaturalist would risk stating as a certainty to what division of the organickingdom of nature they belong. No more can modern chemists deny that such germscan be quickened, in a congenial element, in an incredibly short space of time.Now, if chemistry has, on the one hand, found means of depriving the air of itsfloating germs, and under opposite conditions can develop, or allow theseorganisms to develop, why could not the magicians of Egypt do so \"with theirenchantments\"? It is far easier to imagine that Moses, who, on the authority ofManetho, had been an Egyptian priest, and had learned all the secrets of theland of Chemia, produced \"miracles\" according to natural laws, than that GodHimself violated the established order of His universe. We repeat that we haveseen this sanguification of water produced by Eastern adepts. It can be done ineither of two ways: In one case the experimenter employed a magnetic rodstrongly electrified, which he passed over a quantity of water in a metallicbasin, following a prescribed process, which we have no right to describe morefully at present; the water threw up in about ten hours a sort of reddish froth,which after two hours more became a kind of lichen, like the lepraria kermasinaof Baron Wrangel. It then changed into a blood-red jelly, which made of thewater a crimson liquid that, twenty-four hours later, swarmed with livingorganisms. The second experiment consisted in thickly strowing the surface of asluggish brook, having a muddy bottom, with the powder of a plant that had beendried in the sun and subsequently pulverized. Although this powder was seeminglycarried off by the stream, some of it must have settled to the bottom, for onthe following morning the water thickened at the surface and appeared coveredwith what de Candolle describes as Oscellatoria rubescens, of a crimson-redcolor, and which he believes to be the connecting link between vegetable andanimal life. Taking the above into consideration, we do not see why the learned alchemistsand physicists--physicists, we say--of the Mosaic period should not also havepossessed the natural secret of developing in a few hours myriads of a kind ofthese bacteria, whose spores are found in the air, the water, and most vegetableand animal tissues. The rod plays as important a part in the hands of Aaron andMoses as it did in all so-called \"magic mummeries\" of kabalist-magicians in themiddle ages, that are now considered superstitious foolery and charlatanism. Therod of Paracelsus (his kabalistic trident) and the famous wands of AlbertusMagnus, Roger Bacon, and Henry Kunrath, are no more to be ridiculed than thegraduating-rod of our electro-magnetic physicians. Things which appearedpreposterous and impossible to the ignorant quacks and even learned scientistsof the last century, now begin to assume the shadowy outlines of probability,and in many cases are accomplished facts. Nay, some learned quacks and ignorantscientists even begin to admit this truth. In a fragment preserved by Eusebius, Porphyry, in his Letter to Anebo, appealsto Choeremon, the \"hierogrammatist,\" to prove that the doctrine of the magicarts, whose adepts \"could terrify even the gods,\" was really countenanced byEgyptian sages. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu010.htm#fn_610] Now,bearing in mind the rule of historical evidence propounded by Mr. Huxley, in hisNashville address, two conclusions present themselves with irresistible force:First, Porphyry, being in such unquestioned repute as a highly moral andhonorable man, not given to exaggeration in his statements, was incapable oftelling a lie about this matter, and did not lie; and second, that being solearned in every department of human knowledge about which he treats, ** it wasmost unlikely that he should be imposed upon as regards the magic \"arts,\" and hewas not imposed upon. Therefore, the doctrine of chances supporting the theoryof Professor Huxley, compels us to believe, 1, That there was really such athing as magic \"arts\"; and, 2, That they were known and practiced by theEgyptian magicians and priests, whom even Sir David Brewster concedes to havebeen men of profound scientific attainments.

Let us enter them barefoot. As we pass the sacred adyta of the templeof learning, we are nearing the blazing sun of the Huxleyocentric system. Let uscast down our eyes, lest we be blinded. We have discussed the various matters contained in this book, with suchmoderation as we could command in view of the attitude which the scientific andtheological world have maintained for centuries toward those from whom they haveinherited the broad foundations of all the actual knowledge which they possess.When we stand at one side, and, as a spectator, see how much the ancients knew,and how much the moderns think they know, we are amazed that the unfairness ofour contemporary schoolmen should pass undetected. Every day brings new admissions of scientists themselves, and the criticisms ofwell-informed lay observers. We find the following illustrative paragraph in adaily paper: \"It is curious to note the various opinions which prevail among scientific menin regard to some of the most ordinary natural phenomena. The aurora is anotable case in point. Descartes considered it a meteor falling from the upperregions of the atmosphere. Halley attributed it to the magnetism of theterrestrial globe, and Dalton agreed with this opinion. Coates supposed that theaurora was derived from the fermentation of a matter emanating from the earth.Marion held it to be a consequence of a contact between the bright atmosphere ofthe sun and the atmosphere of our planet. Euler thought the aurora proceededfrom the vibrations of the ether among the particles of the terrestrialatmosphere. Canton and Franklin regarded it as a purely electrical phenomenon,and Parrot attributed it to the conflagration of hydrogen-carbonide escapingfrom the earth in consequence of the putrefaction of vegetable substances, andconsidered the shooting stars as the initial cause of such conflagration. De laRive and Oersted concluded it to be an electro-magnetic phenomenon, but purelyterrestrial. Olmsted suspected that a certain nebulous body revolved around thesun in a certain time, and that when this body came into the neighborhood of theearth, a part of its gaseous material mixed with our atmosphere, and that thiswas the origin of the phenomenon of the aurora.\" And so we might say of everybranch of science. Thus, it would seem that even as to the most ordinary natural phenomena,scientific opinion is far from being unanimous. There is not an experimentalistor theologian, who, in dealing with the subtile relations between mind andmatter, their genesis and ultimate, does not draw a magical circle, the plane ofwhich he calls forbidden ground. Where faith permits a clergyman to go, he goes;for, as Tyndall says, \"they do not lack the positive element--namely, the loveof truth; but the negative element, the fear of error, preponderates.\" But thetrouble is, that their dogmatic creed weighs down the nimble feet of theirintellect, as the ball and chain does the prisoner in the trenches. As to the advance of scientists, their very learning, moreover, is impeded bythese two causes--their constitutional incapacity to understand the spiritualside of nature, and their dread of public opinion. No one has said a sharperthing against them than Professor Tyndall, when he remarks, \"in fact, thegreatest cowards of the present day are not to be found among the clergy, butwithin the pale of science itself.\" * If there had been the slightest doubt ofthe applicability of this degrading epithet, it was removed by the conduct ofProfessor Tyndall himself; for, in his Belfast address, as President of theBritish Association, he not only discerned in matter \"the promise and potency ofevery form and quality of life,\" but pictured science as \"wresting from theologythe entire domain of cosmological theory\"; and then, when confronted with anangry public opinion, issued a revised edition of the address in which he hadmodified his expression, substituting for the words \"every form and quality oflife,\" all terrestrial life. This is more than cowardly--it is an ignominioussurrender of his professed principles. At the time of the Belfast meeting, Mr.Tyndall had two pet aversions--Theology and Spiritualism. What he thought of theformer has been shown; the latter he called \"a degrading belief.\" When hardpressed by the Church for alleged atheism, he made haste to disclaim theimputation, and sue for peace; but, as his agitated \"nervous centres\" and\"cerebral molecules\" had to equilibrate by expanding their force in somedirection, he turns upon the helpless, because pusillanimous, spiritualists, andin his Fragments of Science insults their belief after this fashion: \"The worldwill have a religion of some kind, even though it should fly for it to theintellectual whoredom of Spiritualism.\" What a monstrous anomaly, that somemillions of intelligent persons should permit themselves to be thus reviled by aleader in science, who, himself, has told us that \"the thing to be repressedboth in science and out of it is 'dogmatism!' \" We will not encroach upon space by discussing the etymological value of theepithet. While expressing the hope that it may not be adopted in future ages byscience as a Tyndallism, we will simply remind the benevolent gentleman of avery characteristic feature in himself. One of our most intelligent, honorable,and erudite spiritualists, an author of no small renown, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu011.htm#fn_613] has pointedly termed thisfeature as \"his (Tyndall's) simultaneous coquetry with opposite opinions.\" If weare to accept the epithet of Mr. Tyndall in all its coarse signification, itapplies less to spiritualists, who are faithful to their belief, than to theatheistical scientist who quits the loving embraces of materialism to flinghimself in the arms of a despised theism; only because he finds his profit init. We have seen how Magendie frankly confesses the ignorance of physiologists as tosome of the most important problems of life, and how Fournie agrees with him.Professor Tyndall admits that the evolution-hypothesis does not solve, does notprofess to solve, the ultimate mystery. We have also given as much thought as our natural powers will permit toProfessor Huxley's celebrated lecture On the Physical Basis of Life, so thatwhat we may say in this volume as to the tendency of modern scientific thoughtmay be free from ignorant misstatement. Compressing his theory within theclosest possible limits, it may be formulated thus: Out of cosmic matter allthings are created; dissimilar forms result from different permutations andcombinations of this matter; matter has \"devoured spirit,\" hence spirit does notexist; thought is a property of matter; existing forms die that others may taketheir place; the dissimilarity in organism is due only to varying chemicalaction in the same life-matter--all protoplasm being identical. As far as chemistry and microscopy goes, Professor Huxley's system may befaultless, and the profound sensation caused throughout the world by itsenunciation can be readily understood. But its defect is that the thread of hislogic begins nowhere, and ends in a void. He has made the best possible use ofthe available material. Given a universe crowded with molecules, endowed withactive force, and containing in themselves the principle of life, and all therest is easy; one set of inherent forces impel to aggregate into worlds, andanother to evolve the various forms of plant and animal organism. But what gavethe first impulse to those molecules and endowed them with that mysteriousfaculty of life? What is this occult property which causes the protoplasms ofman, beast, reptile, fish, or plant, to differentiate, each ever evolving itsown kind, and never any other? And after the physical body gives up itsconstituents to the soil and air, \"whether fungus or oak, worm or man,\" whatbecomes of the life which once animated the frame? Is the law of evolution, so imperative in its application to the method ofnature, from the time when cosmic molecules are floating, to the time when theyform a human brain, to be cut short at that point, and not allowed to developmore perfect entities out of this \"preexistent law of form\"? Is Mr. Huxleyprepared to assert the impossibility of man's attainment to a state of existenceafter physical death, in which he will be surrounded with new forms of plant andanimal life, the result of new arrangements of now sublimated matter? * Heacknowledges that he knows nothing about the phenomena of gravitation; exceptthat, in all human experience, as \"stones, unsupported, have fallen to theground, there is no reason for believing that any stone so circumstanced willnot fall to the ground.\" But, he utterly repels any attempt to change thisprobability into a necessity, and in fact says: \"I utterly repudiate andanathematize the intruder. Facts I know, and Law I know; but what is thisnecessity, save an empty shadow of my own mind's throwing?\" It is this, only,that everything which happens in nature is the result of necessity, and a lawonce operative will continue to so operate indefinitely until it is neutralizedby an opposing law of equal potency. Thus, it is natural that the stone shouldfall to the ground in obedience to one force, and it is equally natural that itshould not fall, or that having fallen, it should rise again, in obedience toanother force equally potent; which Mr. Huxley may, or may not, be familiarwith. It is natural that a chair should rest upon the floor when once placedthere, and it is equally natural (as the testimony of hundreds of competentwitnesses shows) that it should rise in the air, untouched by any visible,mortal hand. Is it not Mr. Huxley's duty to first ascertain the reality of thisphenomenon, and then invent a new scientific name for the force behind it? \"Facts I know,\" says Mr. Huxley, \"and Law I know.\" Now, by what means did hebecome acquainted with Fact and Law? Through his own senses, no doubt; and thesevigilant servants enabled him to discover enough of what he considers truth toconstruct a system which he himself confesses \"appears almost shocking to commonsense.\" If his testimony is to be accepted as the basis for a generalreconstruction of religious belief, when they have produced only a theory afterall, why is not the cumulative testimony of millions of people as to theoccurrence of phenomena which undermine its very foundations, worthy of a likerespectful consideration? Mr. Huxley is not interested in these phenomena, butthese millions are; and while he has been digesting his \"bread andmutton-protoplasms,\" to gain strength for still bolder metaphysical flights,they have been recognizing the familiar handwriting of those they loved thebest, traced by spiritual hands, and discerning the shadowy simulacra of thosewho, having lived here, and passed through the change of death, give the lie tohis pet theory. So long as science will confess that her domain lies within the limits of thesechanges of matter; and that chemistry will certify that matter, by changing itsform \"from the solid or liquid, to the gaseous condition,\" only changes from thevisible to the invisible; and that, amid all these changes, the same quantity ofmatter remains, she has no right to dogmatize. She is incompetent to say eitheryea or nay, and must abandon the ground to persons more intuitional than herrepresentatives. High above all other names in his Pantheon of Nihilism, Mr. Huxley writes thatof David Hume. He esteems that philosopher's great service to humanity to be hisirrefragable demonstration of \"the limits of philosophical inquiry,\" outsidewhich lie the fundamental doctrines \"of spiritualism,\" and other \"isms.\" It istrue that the tenth chapter of Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding wasso highly esteemed by its author, that he considered that \"with the wise andlearned\" it would be an \"everlasting check to all kinds of superstitiousdelusion,\" which with him was simply a convertible term to represent a belief insome phenomena previously unfamiliar and by him arbitrarily classified asmiracle. But, as Mr. Wallace justly observes, Hume's apothegm, that \"a miracleis a violation of the laws of nature,\" is imperfect; for in the first place itassumes that we know all the laws of nature; and, second, that an unusualphenomenon is a miracle. Mr. Wallace proposes that a miracle should be definedas: \"any act or event necessarily implying the existence and agency ofsuperhuman intelligences.\" Now Hume himself says that \"a uniform experienceamounts to a proof,\" and Huxley, in this famous essay of his, admits that all wecan know of the existence of the law of gravitation is that since, in all humanexperience, stones unsupported have fallen to the ground, there is no reason forbelieving that the same thing will not occur again, under the samecircumstances, but, on the contrary, every reason to believe that it will. If it were certain that the limits of human experience could never be enlarged,then there might be some justice in Hume's assumption that he was familiar withall that could happen under natural law, and some decent excuse for thecontemptuous tone which marks all of Huxley's allusions to spiritualism. But, asit is evident from the writings of both these philosophers, that they areignorant of the possibilities of psychological phenomena, too much cautioncannot be used in according weight to their dogmatic assertions. One wouldreally suppose that a person who should permit himself such rudeness ofcriticism upon spiritualistic manifestations had qualified himself for theoffice of censor by an adequate course of study; but, in a letter addressed tothe London Dialectical Society, Mr. Huxley, after saying that he had no time todevote to the subject, and that it does not interest him, makes the followingconfession, which shows us upon what slight foundation modern scientistssometimes form very positive opinions. \"The only case of spiritualism,\" hewrites, \"I ever had the opportunity of examining into for myself, was as grossan imposture as ever came under my notice.\" What would this protoplasmic philosopher think of a spiritualist who, having hadbut one opportunity to look through a telescope, and upon that sole occasion hadhad some deception played upon him by a tricky assistant at the observatory,should forthwith denounce astronomy as a \"degrading belief\"? This fact showsthat scientists, as a rule, are useful only as collectors of physical facts;their generalizations from them are often feebler and far more illogical thanthose of their lay critics. And this also is why they misrepresent ancientdoctrines. Professor Balfour Stewart pays a very high tribute to the philosophicalintuition of Herakleitus, the Ephesian, who lived five centuries before our era;the \"crying\" philosopher who declared that \"fire was the great cause, and thatall things were in a perpetual flux.\" \"It seems clear,\" says the professor,\"that Herakleitus must have had a vivid conception of the innate restlessnessand energy of the universe, a conception allied in character to, and only lessprecise than that of modern philosophers who regard matter as essentiallydynamical.\" He considers the expression fire as very vague; and quite naturally,for the evidence is wanting to show that either Prof. Balfour Stewart (who seemsless inclined to materialism than some of his colleagues) or any of hiscontemporaries understand in what sense the word fire was used. His opinions about the origin of things were the same as those of Hippocrates.Both entertained the same views of a supreme power, * and, therefore, if theirnotions of primordial fire, regarded as a material force, in short, as one akinto Leibnitz's dynamism, were \"less precise\" than those of modern philosophers, aquestion which remains to be settled yet, on the other hand their metaphysicalviews of it were far more philosophical and rational than the one-sided theoriesof our present-day scholars. Their ideas of fire were precisely those of thelater \"fire-philosophers,\" the Rosicrucians, and the earlier Zoroastrians. Theyaffirmed that the world was created of fire, the divine spirit of which was anomnipotent and omniscient GOD. Science has condescended to corroborate theirclaims as to the physical question. Fire, in the ancient philosophy of all times and countries, including our own,has been regarded as a triple principle. As water comprises a visible fluid withinvisible gases lurking within, and, behind all the spiritual principle ofnature, which gives them their dynamic energy, so, in fire, they recognized:1st. Visible flame; 2d. Invisible, or astral fire--invisible when inert, butwhen active producing heat, light, chemical force, and electricity, themolecular powers; 3d. Spirit. They applied the same rule to each of theelements; and everything evolved from their combinations and correlations, manincluded, was held by them to be triune. Fire, in the opinion of theRosicrucians, who were but the successors of the theurgists, was the source, notonly of the material atoms, but also of the forces which energize them. When avisible flame is extinguished it has disappeared, not only from the sight butalso from the conception of the materialist, forever. But the Hermeticphilosopher follows it through the \"partition-world of the knowable, across andout on the other side into the unknowable,\" as he traces the disembodied humanspirit, \"vital spark of heavenly flame,\" into the AEthereum, beyond thegrave. ** This point is too important to be passed by without a few words of comment. Theattitude of physical science toward the spiritual half of the cosmos isperfectly exemplified in her gross conception of fire. In this, as in everyother branch of science, their philosophy does not contain one sound plank:every one is honeycombed and weak. The works of their own authorities teemingwith humiliating confessions, give us the right to say that the floor upon whichthey stand is so unstable, that at any moment some new discovery, by one oftheir own number, may knock away the props and let them all fall in a heaptogether. They are so anxious to drive spirit out of their conceptions that, asBalfour Stewart says: \"There is a tendency to rush into the opposite extreme,and to work physical conceptions to an excess.\" He utters a timely warning inadding: \"Let us be cautious that, in avoiding Scylla, we do not rush intoCharybdis. For the universe has more than one point of view, and there arepossibly regions which will not yield their treasures to the most determinedphysicists, armed only with kilogrammes and meters and standard clocks.\" * Inanother place he confesses: \"We know nothing, or next to nothing, of theultimate structure and properties of matter, whether organic or inorganic.\" As to the other great question--we find in Macaulay, a still more unreserveddeclaration: \"The question what becomes of man after death--we do not see that ahighly educated European, left to his unassisted reason, is more likely to be inthe right than a Blackfoot Indian. Not a single one of the many sciences inwhich we surpass the Blackfoot Indians throws the smallest light on the state ofthe soul after the animal life is extinct. In truth, all the philosophers,ancient and modern, who have attempted, without the help of revelation, to provethe immortality of man, from Plato down to Franklin, appear to us to have faileddeplorably.\" There are revelations of the spiritual senses of man which may be trusted farmore than all the sophistries of materialism. What was a demonstration and asuccess in the eyes of Plato and his disciples is now considered the overflow ofa spurious philosophy and a failure. The scientific methods are reversed. Thetestimony of the men of old, who were nearer to truth, for they were nearer tothe spirit of nature--the only aspect under which the Deity will allow itself tobe viewed and understood--and their demonstrations, are rejected. Theirspeculations--if we must believe the modern thinkers--are but the expression ofa redundance of the unsystematic opinions of men unacquainted with thescientific method of the present century. They foolishly based the little theyknew of physiology on well-demonstrated psychology, while the scholar of our daybases psychology--of which he confesses himself utterly ignorant--on physiology,which to him is as yet a closed book, and has not even a method of its own, asFournie tells us. As to the last objection in Macaulay's argument, it wasanswered by Hippocrates centuries ago: \"All knowledge, all arts are to be foundin nature,\" he (PAGE MISSING IN SOURCE) The artist will display his waves of harmony better on a royal Erard than hecould have done on a spinet of the sixteenth century. Therefore whether thisinstinctive impulse was directly impressed upon the nervous system of the firstinsect, or each species has gradually had it developed in itself byinstinctively mimicking the acts of its like, as the more perfected doctrine ofHerbert Spencer has it, is immaterial to the present subject. The questionconcerns spiritual evolution only. And if we reject this hypothesis asunscientific and undemonstrated, then will the physical aspect of evolution haveto follow it to the ground in its turn, because the one is as undemonstrated asthe other, and the spiritual intuition of man is not allowed to dovetail thetwo, under the pretext that it is \"unphilosophical.\" Whether we wish it or not,we will have to fall back on the old query of Plutarch's Symposiacs, whether itwas the bird or the egg which first made its appearance. Now that the Aristotelean authority is shaken to its foundations with that ofPlato; and our men of science reject every authority--nay hate it, except eachhis own; and the general estimate of human collective wisdom is at the lowestdiscount, mankind, headed by science itself, is still irrepressibly drawing backto the starting-point of the oldest philosophies. We find our idea perfectlyexpressed by a writer in the Popular Science Monthly. \"The gods of sects andspecialities,\" says Osgood Mason, \"may perhaps be failing of their accustomedreverence, but, in the mean time, there is dawning on the world, with a softerand serener light, the conception, imperfect though it still may be, of aconscious, originating, all-pervading active soul--the 'Over-Soul,' the Cause,the Deity; unrevealed through human form or speech, but filling and inspiringevery living soul in the wide universe according to its measure: whose temple isNature, and whose worship is admiration.\" This is pure Platonism, Buddhism, andthe exalted but just views of the earliest Aryans in their deification ofnature. And such is the expression of the ground-thought of every theosophist,kabalist, and occultist in general; and if we compare it with the quotation fromHippocrates, which precedes the above, we will find in it exactly the samethought and spirit. To return to our subject. The child lacks reason, it being as yet latent in him;and meanwhile he is inferior to the animal as to instinct proper. He will burnor drown himself before he learns that fire and water destroy and are dangerousfor him; while the kitten will avoid both instinctively. The little instinct thechild possesses fades away as reason, step by step, develops itself. It may beobjected, perhaps, that instinct cannot be a spiritual gift, because animalspossess it in a higher degree than man, and animals have no souls. Such a beliefis erroneous and based upon very insecure foundations. It came from the factthat the inner nature of the animal could be fathomed still less than that ofman, who is endowed with speech and can display to us his psychological powers. But what proofs other than negative have we that the animal is without asurviving, if not immortal, soul? On strictly scientific grounds we can adduceas many arguments pro as contra. To express it clearer, neither man nor animalcan offer either proof or disproof of the survival of their souls after death.And from the point of view of scientific experience, it is impossible to bringthat which has no objective existence under the cognizance of any exact law ofscience. But Descartes and Bois-Raymond have exhausted their imaginations on thesubject, and Agassiz could not realize such a thing as a future existence notshared by the animals we loved, and even the vegetable kingdom which surroundsus. And it is enough to make one's feelings revolt against the claimed justiceof the First Cause to believe that while a heartless, cold-blooded villain hasbeen endowed with an immortal spirit, the noble, honest dog, often self-denyingunto death; that protects the child or master he loves at the peril of his life;that never forgets him, but starves himself on his grave; the animal in whom thesense of justice and generosity are sometimes developed to an amazing degree,will be annihilated! No, away with the civilized reason which suggests suchheartless partiality. Better, far better to cling to one's instinct in such acase, and believe with the Indian of Pope, whose \"untutored mind\" can onlypicture to himself a heaven where \". . . admitted to that equal sky,His faithful dog shall bear him company.\"Space fails us to present the speculative views of certain ancient and mediaevaloccultists upon this subject. Suffice it that they antedated Darwin, embracedmore or less all his theories on natural selection and the evolution of species,and largely extended the chain at both ends. Moreover, these philosophers wereexplorers as daring in psychology as in physiology and anthropology. They neverturned aside from the double parallel-path traced for them by their great masterHermes. \"As above, so below,\" was ever their axiom; and their physical evolutionwas traced out simultaneously with the spiritual one. On one point, at least, our modern biologists are quite consistent: unable, asyet, to demonstrate the existence of a distinct individual soul in animals, theydeny it to man. Reason has brought them to the brink of Tyndall's \"impassablechasm,\" between mind and matter; instinct alone can teach them to bridge it.When in their despair of ever being able to fathom the mystery of life, theywill have come to a dead stop, their instinct may reassert itself, and take themacross the hitherto fathomless abyss. This is the point which Professor JohnFiske and the authors of the Unseen Universe seem to have reached; and Wallace,the anthropologist and ex-materialist, to have been the first to courageouslystep over. Let them push boldly on till they discover that it is not spirit thatdwells in matter, but matter which clings temporarily to spirit; and that thelatter alone is an eternal, imperishable abode for all things visible andinvisible. Esoteric philosophers held that everything in nature is but a materialization ofspirit. The Eternal First Cause is latent spirit, they said, and matter from thebeginning. \"In the beginning was the word . . . and the word was God.\" Whileconceding the idea of such a God to be an unthinkable abstraction to humanreason, they claimed that the unerring human instinct grasped it as areminiscence of something concrete to it though intangible to our physicalsenses. With the first idea, which emanated from the double-sexed andhitherto-inactive Deity, the first motion was communicated to the wholeuniverse, and the electric thrill was instantaneously felt throughout theboundless space. Spirit begat force, and force matter; and thus the latent deitymanifested itself as a creative energy. When; at what point of the eternity; or how? the question must always remainunanswered, for human reason is unable to grasp the great mystery. But, thoughspirit-matter was from all eternity, it was in the latent state; the evolutionof our visible universe must have had a beginning. To our feeble intellect, thisbeginning may seem so remote as to appear to us eternity itself--a periodinexpressible in figures or language. Aristotle argued that the world waseternal, and that it will always be the same; that one generation of men hasalways produced another, without ever having had a beginning that could bedetermined by our intellect. In this, his teaching, in its exoteric sense,clashed with that of Plato, who taught that \"there was a time when mankind didnot perpetuate itself\"; but in spirit both the doctrines agreed, as Plato addsimmediately: \"This was followed by the earthly human race, in which theprimitive history was gradually forgotten and man sank deeper and deeper\"; andAristotle says: \"If there has been a first man he must have been born withoutfather or mother--which is repugnant to nature. For there could not have been afirst egg to give a beginning to birds, or there should have been a first birdwhich gave a beginning to eggs; for a bird comes from an egg.\" The same he heldgood for all species, believing, with Plato, that everything before it appearedon earth had first its being in spirit. This mystery of first creation, which was ever the despair of science, isunfathomable, unless we accept the doctrine of the Hermetists. Though matter iscoeternal with spirit, that matter is certainly not our visible, tangible, anddivisible matter, but its extreme sublimation. Pure spirit is but one removehigher. Unless we allow man to have been evolved out of this primordialspirit-matter, how can we ever come to any reasonable hypothesis as to thegenesis of animate beings? Darwin begins his evolution of species at the lowestpoint and traces upward. His only mistake may be that he applies his system atthe wrong end. Could he remove his quest from the visible universe into theinvisible, he might find himself on the right path. But then, he would befollowing in the footsteps of the Hermetists. That our philosophers--positivists--even the most learned among them, neverunderstood the spirit of the mystic doctrines taught by the oldphilosophers--Platonists--is evident from that most eminent modern work,Conflict between Religion and Science. Professor Draper begins his fifth chapterby saying that \"the Pagan Greeks and Romans believed that the spirit of manresembles his bodily form, varying its appearance with his variations, andgrowing with his growth.\" What the ignorant masses thought is a matter of littleconsequence, though even they could never have indulged in such speculationstaken a la lettre. As to Greek and Roman philosophers of the Platonic school,they believed no such thing of the spirit of man, but applied the above doctrineto his soul, or psychical nature, which, as we have previously shown, is not thedivine spirit. Aristotle, in his philosophical deduction On Dreams, shows this doctrine of thetwofold soul, or soul and spirit, very plainly. \"It is necessary for us toascertain in what portion of the soul dreams appear,\" he says. All the ancientGreeks believed not only a double, but even a triple soul to exist in man. Andeven Homer we find terming the animal soul, or the astral soul, called by Mr.Draper \"spirit,\" θυμος, and the divine one νους--the name by which Plato alsodesignated the higher spirit. The Hindu Jainas conceive the soul, which they call Jiva, to have been unitedfrom all eternity to even two sublimated ethereal bodies, one of which isinvariable and consists of the divine powers of the higher mind; the othervariable and composed of the grosser passions of man, his sensual affections,and terrestrial attributes. When the soul becomes purified after death it joinsits Vaycarica, or divine spirit, and becomes a god. The followers of the Vedas,the learned Brahmins, explain the same doctrine in the Vedanta. The soul,according to their teaching, as a portion of the divine universal spirit orimmaterial mind, is capable of uniting itself with the essence of its highestEntity. The teaching is explicit; the Vedanta affirms that whoever attains thethorough knowledge of his god becomes a god while yet in his mortal body, andacquires supremacy over all things. Quoting from the Vedaic theology the verse which says: \"There is in truth butone Deity, the Supreme Spirit; he is of the same nature as the soul of man,\" Mr.Draper shows the Buddhistic doctrines as reaching Eastern Europe throughAristotle. We believe the assertion unwarranted, for Pythagoras, and after himPlato, taught them long before Aristotle. If subsequently the later Platonistsaccepted in their dialectics the Aristotelean arguments on emanation, it wasmerely because his views coincided in some respect with those of the Orientalphilosophers. The Pythagorean number of harmony and Plato's esoteric doctrineson creation are inseparable from the Buddhistic doctrine of emanation; and thegreat aim of the Pythagorean philosophy, namely, to free the astral soul fromthe fetters of matter and sense, and make it thereby fit for an eternalcontemplation of spiritual things, is a theory identical with the Buddhisticdoctrine of final absorption. It is the Nirvana, interpreted in its right sense;a metaphysical tenet that just begins to be suspected now by our latest Sanscritscholars. If the doctrines of Aristotle have exercised on the later Neo-platonists such a\"dominating influence,\" how is it that neither Plotinus, nor Porphyry, norProclus ever accepted his theories on dreams and prophetic soul-visions? WhileAristotle held that most of those who prophesy have \"diseases ofmadness\" *--thus furnishing some American plagiarists and specialists with a fewreasonable ideas to disfigure--the views of Porphyry, hence those of Plotinus,were quite the reverse. In the most vital questions of metaphysical speculationsAristotle is constantly contradicted by the Neo-platonists. Furthermore, eitherthe Buddhistic Nirvana is not the nihilistic doctrine, as it is now representedto be, or the Neo-platonists did not accept it in this sense. Surely Mr. Draperwill not take upon himself to affirm that either Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus,or any other philosopher of their mystic school, did not believe in the soul'simmortality? To say that either of them sought ecstasy as a \"foretaste ofabsorption into the universal mundane soul,\" in the sense in which the BuddhistNirvana is understood by every Sanscrit scholar, is to wrong these philosophers.Nirvana is not, as Mr. Draper has it, a \"reabsorption in the Universal Force,eternal rest, and bliss\"; but, when taken literally by the said scholars, meansthe blowing out, the extinction, complete annihilation, and not absorption. **No one, so far as we know, has ever taken upon himself to ascertain the truemetaphysical meaning of this word, which is not to be found, even in theLankavatara, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu011.htm#fn_620] which givesthe different interpretations of the Nirvana by the Brahmans-Tirthakas.Therefore, for one who reads this passage in Mr. Draper's work, and bears inmind but the usually-accepted meaning of the Nirvana, will naturally supposethat Plotinus and Porphyry were nihilists. Such a page in the Conflict gives usa certain right to suppose that either 1, the learned author desired to placePlotinus and Porphyry on the same plane with Giordano Bruno, of whom he makes,very erroneously, an atheist; or, 2, that he never took the trouble of studyingthe lives of these philosophers and their views. Now, for one who knows Professor Draper, even by reputation, the lattersupposition is simply absurd. Therefore, we must think, with deep regret, thathis desire was to misrepresent their religious aspirations. It is decidedly anawkward thing for modern philosophers, whose sole aim seems to be theelimination of the ideas of God and the immortal spirit from the mind ofhumanity, to have to treat with historical impartiality the most celebrated ofthe Pagan Platonists. To have to admit, on the one hand, their profoundlearning, their genius, their achievements in the most abstruse philosophicalquestions, and therefore their sagacity; and, on the other, their unreservedadhesion to the doctrine of immortality, of the final triumph of spirit overmatter, and their implicit faith in God and the gods, or spirits; in the returnof the dead, apparitions, and other \"spiritual\" matters, is a dilemma from whichacademical human nature could not reasonably be expected to extricate itself soeasily. The plan resorted to by Lempriere, ** in such an emergency as the above, iscoarser than Professor Draper's, but equally effective. He charges the ancientphilosophers with deliberate falsehood, trickery, and credulity. After paintingto his readers Pythagoras, Plotinus, and Porphyry as marvels of learning,morality, and accomplishments; as men eminent for personal dignity, purity oflives, and self-abnegation in the pursuit of divine truths, he does not hesitateto rank \"this celebrated philosopher\" (Pythagoras) among impostors; while toPorphyry he attributes \"credulity, lack of judgment, and dishonesty.\" Forced bythe facts of history to give them their just due in the course of his narrative,he displays his bigoted prejudice in the parenthetical comments which he allowshimself. From this antiquated writer of the last century we learn that a man maybe honest, and at the same time an impostor; pure, virtuous, and a greatphilosopher, and yet dishonest, a liar, and a fool! We have shown elsewhere that the \"secret doctrine\" does not concede immortalityto all men alike. \"The eye would never see the sun, if it were not of the natureof the sun,\" said Plotinus. Only \"through the highest purity and chastity weshall approach nearer to God, and receive in the contemplation of Him, the trueknowledge and insight,\" writes Porphyry. If the human soul has neglected duringits life-time to receive its illumination from its Divine Spirit, our personalGod, then it becomes difficult for the gross and sensual man to survive for agreat length of time his physical death. No more than the misshapen monster canlive long after its physical birth, can the soul, once that it has become toomaterial, exist after its birth into the spiritual world. The viability of theastral form is so feeble, that the particles cannot cohere firmly when once itis slipped out of the unyielding capsule of the external body. Its particles,gradually obeying the disorganizing attraction of universal space, finally flyasunder beyond the possibility of reaggregation. Upon the occurrence of such acatastrophe, the individual ceases to exist; his glorious Augoeides has lefthim. During the intermediary period between his bodily death and thedisintegration of the astral form, the latter, bound by magnetic attraction toits ghastly corpse, prowls about, and sucks vitality from susceptible victims.The man having shut out of himself every ray of the divine light, is lost indarkness, and, therefore, clings to the earth and the earthy. No astral soul, even that of a pure, good, and virtuous man, is immortal in thestrictest sense; \"from elements it was formed--to elements it must return.\"Only, while the soul of the wicked vanishes, and is absorbed without redemption,that of every other person, even moderately pure, simply changes its etherealparticles for still more ethereal ones; and, while there remains in it a sparkof the Divine, the individual man, or rather, his personal ego, cannot die.\"After death,\" says Proclus, \"the soul (the spirit) continueth to linger in theaerial body (astral form), till it is entirely purified from all angry andvoluptuous passions . . . then doth it put off by a second dying the aerial bodyas it did the earthly one. Whereupon, the ancients say that there is a celestialbody always joined with the soul, and which is immortal, luminous, andstar-like.\" But, we will now turn from our digression to further consider the question ofreason and instinct. The latter, according to the ancients, proceeded from thedivine, the former from the purely human. One (the instinct) is the product ofthe senses, a sagaciousness shared by the lowest animals, even those who have noreason--it is the αισθετικον the other is the product of the reflectivefaculties--νοετικον, denoting judiciousness and human intellectuality.Therefore, an animal devoid of reasoning powers has in its inherent instinct anunerring faculty which is but that spark of the divine which lurks in everyparticle of inorganic matter--itself materialized spirit. In the Jewish Kabala,the second and third chapters of Genesis are explained thus: When the secondAdam is created \"out of the dust,\" matter has become so gross that it reignssupreme. Out of its lusts evolves woman, and Lilith has the best of spirit. TheLord God, \"walking in the garden in the cool of the day\" (the sunset of spirit,or divine light obscured by the shadows of matter) curses not only them who havecommitted the sin, but even the ground itself, and all living things--thetempting serpent-matter above all. Who but the kabalists are able to explain this seeming act of injustice? How arewe to understand this cursing of all created things, innocent of any crime? Theallegory is evident. The curse inheres in matter itself. Henceforth, it isdoomed to struggle against its own grossness for purification; the latent sparkof divine spirit, though smothered, is still there; and its invincibleattraction upward compels it to struggle in pain and labor to free itself. Logicshows us that as all matter had a common origin, it must have attributes incommon, and as the vital and divine spark is in man's material body, so it mustlurk in every subordinate species. The latent mentality which, in the lowerkingdoms is recognized as semi-consciousness, consciousness, and instinct, islargely subdued in man. Reason, the outgrowth of the physical brain, develops atthe expense of instinct--the flickering reminiscence of a once divineomniscience--spirit. Reason, the badge of the sovereignty of physical man overall other physical organisms, is often put to shame by the instinct of ananimal. As his brain is more perfect than that of any other creature, itsemanations must naturally produce the highest results of mental action; butreason avails only for the consideration of material things; it is incapable ofhelping its possessor to a knowledge of spirit. In losing instinct, man loseshis intuitional powers, which are the crown and ultimatum of instinct. Reason isthe clumsy weapon of the scientists--intuition the unerring guide of the seer.Instinct teaches plant and animal their seasons for the procreation of theirspecies, and guides the dumb brute to find his appropriate remedy in the hour ofsickness. Reason--the pride of man--fails to check the propensities of hismatter, and brooks no restraint upon the unlimited gratification of his senses.Far from leading him to be his own physician, its subtile sophistries lead himtoo often to his own destruction. Nothing is more demonstrable than the proposition that the perfection of matteris reached at the expense of instinct. The zoophyte attached to the submarinerock, opening its mouth to attract the food that floats by, shows,proportionately with its physical structure, more instinct than the whale. Theant, with its wonderful architectural, social, and political abilities, isinexpressibly higher in the scale than the subtile royal tiger watching itsprey. \"With awe and wonder,\" exclaims du Bois-Raymond, \"must the student ofnature regard that microscopic molecule of nervous substance which is the seatof the laborious, constructive, orderly, loyal, dauntless soul of the ant!\" Like everything else which has its origin in psychological mysteries, instincthas been too long neglected in the domain of science. \"We see what indicated theway to man to find relief for all his physical ailings,\" says Hippocrates. \"Itis the instinct of the earlier races, when cold reason had not as yet obscuredman's inner vision. . . . Its indication must never be disdained, for it is toinstinct alone that we owe our first remedies.\" * Instantaneous and unerringcognition of an omniscient mind, instinct is in everything unlike the finitereason; and in the tentative progress of the latter, the god-like nature of manis often utterly engulfed, whenever he shuts out from himself the divine lightof intuition. The one crawls, the other flies; reason is the power of the man,intuition the prescience of the woman! Plotinus, the pupil of the great Ammonius Saccas, the chief founder of theNeo-platonic school, taught that human knowledge had three ascending steps:opinion, science, and illumination. He explained it by saying that \"the means orinstrument of opinion is sense, or perception; of science, dialectics; ofillumination, intuition (or divine instinct). To the last, reason issubordinate; it is absolute knowledge founded on the identification of the mindwith the object known.\" Prayer opens the spiritual sight of man, for prayer is desire, and desiredevelops WILL; the magnetic emanations proceeding from the body at everyeffort--whether mental or physical--produce self-magnetization and ecstasy.Plotinus recommended solitude for prayer, as the most efficient means ofobtaining what is asked; and Plato advised those who prayed to \"remain silent inthe presence of the divine ones, till they remove the cloud from thy eyes, andenable thee to see by the light which issues from themselves.\" Apollonius alwaysisolated himself from men during the \"conversation\" he held with God, andwhenever he felt the necessity for divine contemplation and prayer, he wrappedhimself, head and all, in the drapery of his white woolen mantle. \"When thouprayest enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thyFather in secret,\" says the Nazarene, the pupil of the Essenes. Every human being is born with the rudiment of the inner sense called intuition,which may be developed into what the Scotch know as \"second sight.\" All thegreat philosophers, who, like Plotinus, Porphyry, and Iamblichus employed thisfaculty, taught the doctrine. \"There is a faculty of the human mind,\" writesIamblichus, \"which is superior to all which is born or begotten. Through it weare enabled to attain union with the superior intelligences, to beingtransported beyond the scenes of this world, and to partaking the higher lifeand peculiar powers of the heavenly ones.\" Were there no inner sight or intuition, the Jews would never have had theirBible, nor the Christians Jesus. What both Moses and Jesus gave to the world wasthe fruit of their intuition or illumination. What their subsequent elders andteachers allowed the world to understand was--dogmatic misrepresentations, toooften blasphemy. To accept the Bible as a \"revelation\" and nail belief to a literal translation,is worse than absurdity--it is a blasphemy against the Divine majesty of the\"Unseen.\" If we had to judge of the Deity, and the world of spirits, by itshuman interpreters, now that philology proceeds with giant-strides on the fieldsof comparative religions, belief in God and the soul's immortality could notwithstand the attacks of reason for one century more. That which supports thefaith of man in God and a spiritual life to come is intuition; that divineoutcome of our inner-self, which defies the mummeries of the Roman Catholicpriest, and his ridiculous idols; the thousand and one ceremonies of the Brahmanand his idols; and the jeremiads of the Protestant preacher, and his desolateand arid creed, with no idols, but a boundless hell and damnation hooked on atthe end. Were it not for this intuition, undying though often wavering becauseso clogged with matter, human life would be a parody and humanity a fraud. Thisineradicable feeling of the presence of some one outside and inside ourselves isone that no dogmatic contradictions, nor external form of worship can destroy inhumanity, let scientists and clergy do what they may. Moved by such thoughts ofthe boundlessness and impersonality of the Deity, Gautama-Buddha, the HinduChrist, exclaimed: \"As the four rivers which fall in the Ganges lose their namesas soon as they mingle their waters with the holy river, so all who believe inBuddha cease to be Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras!\" The Old Testament was compiled and arranged from oral tradition; the massesnever knew its real meaning, for Moses was ordered to impart the \"hidden truths\"but to his seventy elders on whom the \"Lord\" put of the spirit which was uponthe legislator. Maimonides, whose authority and whose knowledge of the sacredhistory can hardly be rejected, says: \"Whoever shall find out the true sense ofthe book of Genesis ought to take care not to divulge it. . . . If a personshould discover the true meaning of it by himself, or by the aid of another,then he ought to be silent; or, if he speaks of it, he ought to speak of it butobscurely and in an enigmatical manner.\" This confession, that what is written in the Holy Writ is but an allegory, wasmade by other Jewish authorities besides Maimonides; for we find Josephusstating that Moses \"philosophized\" (spoke riddles in figurative allegory), whenwriting the book of Genesis. Therefore modern science, by neglecting to unriddlethe true sense of the Bible, and by allowing the whole of Christendom to go onbelieving in the dead letter of the Jewish theology, tacitly constitutes herselfthe confederate of the fanatical clergy. She has no right to ridicule therecords of a people who never wrote them with the idea that they would receivesuch a strange interpretation at the hands of an inimical religion. That theirholiest texts should be turned against them and that the dead men's bones couldhave smothered the spirit of truth, is the saddest feature of Christianity! \"The gods exist,\" says Epicurus, \"but they are not what the rabble, , supposethem to be.\" And yet Epicurus, judged as usual by superficial critics, is setdown and paraded as a materialist. But neither the great First Cause nor its emanation--human, immortalspirit--have left themselves \"without a witness.\" Mesmerism and modernspiritualism are there to attest the great truths. For over fifteen centuries,thanks to the blindly-brutal persecutions of those great vandals of earlyChristian history, Constantine and Justinian, ancient WISDOM slowly degenerateduntil it gradually sank into the deepest mire of monkish superstition andignorance. The Pythagorean \"knowledge of things that are\"; the profounderudition of the Gnostics; the world and time-honored teachings of the greatphilosophers; all were rejected as doctrines of Antichrist and Paganism, andcommitted to the flames. With the last seven wise men of the Orient, the remnantgroup of the Neo-platonists, Hermias, Priscianus, Diogenes, Eulalius, Damaskius,Simplicius and Isidorus, who fled from the fanatical persecutions of Justinian,to Persia, the reign of wisdom closed. The books of Thoth, or (HermesTrismegistus), which contain within their sacred pages the spiritual andphysical history of the creation and progress of our world, were left to mouldin oblivion and contempt for ages. They found no interpreters in ChristianEurope; the Philaletheians, or wise \"lovers of the truth,\" were no more; theywere replaced by the light-fleers, the tonsured and hooded monks of Papal Rome,who dread truth, in whatever shape and from whatever quarter it appears, if itbut clashes in the least with their dogmas. As to skeptics--this is what Professor Alexander Wilder remarks of them andtheir followers, in his sketches on Neo-platonism and Alchemy: \"A century haspassed since the compilers of the French Encyclopaedia infused skepticism intothe blood of the civilized world, and made it disreputable to believe in theactual existence of anything that cannot be tested in crucibles or demonstratedby critical reasoning. Even now, it requires candor as well as courage toventure to treat upon a subject which has been for many years discarded andcontemned, because it has not been well or correctly understood. The person mustbe bold who accounts the Hermetic philosophy to be other than a pretense ofscience, and so believing, demands for its enunciation a patient hearing. Yetits professors were once the princes of learned investigation, and heroes amongcommon men. Besides, nothing is to be despised which men have reverentlybelieved; and disdain for the earnest convictions of others is itself the tokenof ignorance, and of an ungenerous mind.\" And now, encouraged by these words from a scholar who is neither a fanatic nor aconservative, we will recall a few things reported by travellers as having beenseen by them in Thibet and India, and which are treasured by the natives aspractical proofs of the truth of the philosophy and science handed down by theirforefathers. First we may consider that most remarkable phenomenon as seen in the temples ofThibet and the accounts of which have reached Europe from eye-witnesses otherthan Catholic missionaries--whose testimony we will exclude for obvious reasons.Early in the present century a Florentine scientist, a skeptic and acorrespondent of the French Institute, having been permitted to penetrate indisguise to the hallowed precincts of a Buddhist temple, where the most solemnof all ceremonies was taking place, relates the following as having been seen byhimself. An altar is ready in the temple to receive the resuscitated Buddha,found by the initiated priesthood, and recognized by certain secret signs tohave reincarnated himself in a new-born infant. The baby, but a few days old, isbrought into the presence of the people and reverentially placed upon the altar.Suddenly rising into a sitting posture, the child begins to utter in a loud,manly voice, the following sentences: \"I am Buddha, I am his spirit; and I,Buddha, your Dalai-Lama, have left my old, decrepit body, at the temple of . . .and selected the body of this young babe as my next earthly dwelling.\" Ourscientist, being finally permitted by the priests to take, with due reverence,the baby in his arms, and carry it away to such a distance from them as tosatisfy him that no ventriloquial deception is being practiced, the infant looksat the grave academician with eyes that \"make his flesh creep,\" as he expressesit, and repeats the words he had previously uttered. A detailed account of thisadventure, attested with the signature of this eye-witness, was forwarded toParis, but the members of the Institute, instead of accepting the testimony of ascientific observer of acknowledged credibility, concluded that the Florentinewas either suffering under an attack of sunstroke, or had been deceived by aclever trick of acoustics. Although, according to Mr. Stanislas Julien, the French translator of the sacredChinese texts, there is a verse in the Lotus *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu011.htm#fn_623] which says that \"A Buddhais as difficult to be found as the flowers of Udumbara and Palaca,\" if we are tobelieve several eye-witnesses, such a phenomenon does happen. Of course itsoccurrence is rare, for it happens but on the death of every great Dalai-Lama;and these venerable old gentlemen live proverbially long lives. The poor Abbe Huc, whose works of travel in Thibet and China are so well-known,relates the same fact of the resuscitation of Buddha. He adds, furthermore, thecurious circumstance that the baby-oracle makes good his claim to being an oldmind in a young body by giving to those who ask him, \"and who knew him in hispast life, the most exact details of his anterior earthly existence.\" It is worthy of notice, that des Mousseaux, who expatiates at length on thephenomenon, attributing it as a matter of course to the Devil, gravely remarksof the Abbe himself, that the fact that he had been unfrocked (defroque) \"is anaccident which I (he) confess scarcely tends to strengthen our confidence.\" Inour humble opinion this little circumstance strengthens it all the more. The Abbe Huc had his work placed on the Index for the truth he told about thesimilarity of the Buddhistical rites with the Roman Catholic ones. He wasmoreover suspended in his missionary work for being too sincere. If this example of infant prodigy stood alone, we might reasonably indulge insome hesitation as to accepting it; but, to say nothing of the Camisard prophetsof 1707, among whom was the boy of fifteen months described by Jacques Dubois,who spoke in good French \"as though God were speaking through his mouth\"; and ofthe Cevennes babies, whose speaking and prophesying were witnessed by the firstsavants of France--we have instances in modern times of quite as remarkable acharacter. Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper, for March, 1875, contained an account ofthe following phenomenon: \"At Saar-Louis, France, a child was born. The motherhad just been confined, the midwife was holding forth garrulously 'on theblessed little creature,' and the friends were congratulating the father on hisluck, when somebody asked what time it was. Judge of the surprise of all, onhearing the new-born babe reply distinctly 'Two o'clock!' But this was nothingto what followed. The company were looking on the infant, with speechless wonderand dismay, when it opened its eyes, and said: 'I have been sent into the worldto tell you that 1875 will be a good year, but that 1876 will be a year ofblood.' Having uttered this prophecy it turned on its side and expired, agedhalf-an-hour.\" We are not aware that this prodigy has received official authentication by thecivil authority--of course we should look for none from the clergy, since noprofit or honor was to be derived from it--but even if a respectable Britishcommercial journal was not responsible for the story, the result has given itspecial interest. The year 1876, just passed (we write in February, 1877) wasemphatically, and, from the standpoint of March, 1875, unexpectedly--a year ofblood. In the Danubian principalities was written one of the bloodiest chaptersof the history of war and rapine--a chapter of outrages of Moslem upon Christianthat has scarcely been paralleled since Catholic soldiers butchered the simplenatives of North and South America by tens of thousands, and ProtestantEnglishmen waded to the Imperial throne of Delhi, step by step, through riversof blood. If the Saar-Louis prophecy was but a mere newspaper sensation, stillthe turn of events elevated it into the rank of a fulfilled prediction; 1875 wasa year of great plenty, and 1876, to the surprise of everybody, a year ofcarnage. But even if it should be found that the baby-prophet never opened its lips, theinstance of the Jencken infant still remains to puzzle the investigator. This isone of the most surprising cases of mediumship. The child's mother is the famousKate Fox, its father H. D. Jencken, M.R.I., Barrister-at-law, in London. He wasborn in London, in 1873, and before he was three months old showed evidences ofspirit-mediumship. Rappings occurred on his pillow and cradle, and also on hisfather's person, when he held the child in his lap and Mrs. Jencken was absentfrom home. Two months later, a communication of twenty words, exclusive ofsignature, was written through his hand. A gentleman, a Liverpool solicitor,named J. Wason, was present at the time, and united with the mother and nurse ina certificate which was published in the London Medium and Daybreak of May 8th,1874. The professional and scientific rank of Mr. Jencken make it in the highestdegree improbable that he would lend himself to a deception. Moreover, the childwas within such easy reach of the Royal Institution, of which his father is amember, that Professor Tyndall and his associates had no excuse for neglectingto examine and inform the world about this psychological phenomenon. The sacred baby of Thibet being so far away, they find their most convenientplan to be a flat denial, with hints of sunstroke and acoustical machinery. Asfor the London baby, the affair is still easier; let them wait until the childhas grown up and learned to write, and then deny the story point-blank! In addition to other travellers, the Abbe Huc gives us an account of thatwonderful tree of Thibet called the Kounboum; that is to say, the tree of the10,000 images and characters. It will grow in no other latitude, although theexperiment has sometimes been tried; and it cannot even be multiplied fromcuttings. The tradition is that it sprang from the hair of one of the Avatars(the Lama Son-Ka-pa) one of the incarnations of Buddha. But we will let the AbbeHuc tell the rest of the story: \"Each of its leaves, in opening, bears either aletter or a religious sentence, written in sacred characters, and these lettersare, of their kind, of such a perfection that the type-foundries of Didotcontain nothing to excel them. Open the leaves, which vegetation is about tounroll, and you will there discover, on the point of appearing, the letters orthe distinct words which are the marvel of this unique tree! Turn your attentionfrom the leaves of the plant to the bark of its branches, and new characterswill meet your eyes! Do not allow your interest to flag; raise the layers ofthis bark, and still OTHER CHARACTERS will show themselves below those whosebeauty had surprised you. For, do not fancy that these superposed layers repeatthe same printing. No, quite the contrary; for each lamina you lift presents toview its distinct type. How, then, can we suspect jugglery? I have done my bestin that direction to discover the slightest trace of human trick, and my baffledmind could not retain the slightest suspicion.\" We will add to M. Huc's narrative the statement that the characters which appearupon the different portions of the Kounboum are in the Sansar (or language ofthe Sun), characters (ancient Sanscrit); and that the sacred tree, in itsvarious parts, contains in extenso the whole history of the creation, and insubstance the sacred books of Buddhism. In this respect, it bears the samerelation to Buddhism as the pictures in the Temple of Dendera, in Egypt, do tothe ancient faith of the Pharaohs. The latter are briefly described by ProfessorW. B. Carpenter, President of the British Association, in his Manchester Lectureon Egypt. He makes it clear that the Jewish book of Genesis is nothing more thanan expression of the early Jewish ideas, based upon the pictorial records of theEgyptians among whom they lived. But he does not make it clear, exceptinferentially, whether he believes either the Dendera pictures or the Mosaicaccount to be an allegory or a pretended historical narrative. How a scientistwho had devoted himself to the most superficial investigation of the subject canventure to assert that the ancient Egyptians had the same ridiculous notionsabout the world's instantaneous creation as the early Christian theologians,passes comprehension! How can he say that because the Dendera picture happens torepresent their cosmogony in one allegory, they intended to show the scene asoccurring in six minutes or six millions of years? It may as well indicateallegorically six successive epochs or aeons, or eternity, as six days. Besides,the Books of Hermes certainly give no color to the charge, and the Avestaspecifically names six periods, each embracing thousands of years, instead ofdays. Many of the Egyptian hieroglyphics contradict Dr. Carpenter's theory, andChampollion has avenged the ancients in many particulars. From what is gonebefore, it will, we think, be made clear to the reader that the Egyptianphilosophy had no room for any such crude speculations, if the Hebrewsthemselves ever believed them; their cosmogony viewed man as the result ofevolution, and his progress to be marked by immensely lengthened cycles. But toreturn to the wonders of Thibet. Speaking of pictures, the one described by Huc as hanging in a certain Lamaserymay fairly be regarded as one of the most wonderful in existence. It is a simplecanvas without the slightest mechanical apparatus attached, as the visitor mayprove by examining it at his leisure. It represents a moon-lit landscape, butthe moon is not at all motionless and dead; quite the reverse, for, according tothe abbe, one would say that our moon herself, or at least her living double,lighted the picture. Each phase, each aspect, each movement of our satellite, isrepeated in her fac-simile, in the movement and progress of the moon in thesacred picture. \"You see this planet in the painting ride as a crescent, orfull, shine brightly, pass behind the clouds, peep out or set, in a mannercorresponding in the most extraordinary way with the real luminary. It is, in aword, a most servile and resplendent reproduction of the pale queen of thenight, which received the adoration of so many people in the days of old.\" When we think of the astonishment that would inevitably be felt by one of ourself-complacent academicians at seeing such a picture--and it is by no means theonly one, for they have them in other parts of Thibet and Japan also, whichrepresent the sun's movements--when we think, we say, of his embarrassment atknowing that if he ventured to tell the unvarnished truth to his colleagues, hisfate would probably be like that of poor Huc, and he flung out of the academicalchair as a liar or a lunatic, we cannot help recalling the anecdote ofTycho-Brahe, given by Humboldt in his Cosmos. * \"One evening,\" says the great Danish astronomer, \"as, according to my usualhabit, I was considering the celestial vault, to my indescribable amazement, Isaw, close to the zenith, in Cassiopea, a radiant star of extraordinary size.Struck with astonishment, I knew not whether I could believe my own eyes. Sometime after that, I learned that in Germany, cartmen, and other persons of thelower classes had repeatedly warned the scientists that a great apparition couldbe seen in the sky; which fact afforded both the press and public one moreopportunity to indulge in their usual raillery against the men of science, who,in the cases of several antecedent comets, had not predicted their appearance.\" From the days of the earliest antiquity, the Brahmans were known to be possessedof wonderful knowledge in every kind of magic arts. From Pythagoras, the firstphilosopher who studied wisdom with the Gymnosophists, and Plotinus, who wasinitiated into the mystery of uniting one's self with the Deity through abstractcontemplation, down to the modern adepts, it was well known that in the land ofthe Brahmans and Gautama-Buddha the sources of \"hidden\" wisdom are to be soughtafter. It is for future ages to discover this grand truth, and accept it assuch, whereas now it is degraded as a low superstition. What did any one, eventhe greatest scientists, know of India, Thibet, and China, until the lastquarter of this century? That most untiring scholar, Max Muller, tells us thatbefore then not a single original document of the Buddhist religion had beenaccessible to European philologists; that fifty years ago \"there was not asingle scholar who could have translated a line of the Veda, a line of theZend-Avesta, or a line of the Buddhist Tripitaka,\" let alone other dialects orlanguages. And even now, that science is in possession of various sacred texts,what they have are but very incomplete editions of these works, and nothing,positively nothing of the secret sacred literature of Buddhism. And the littlethat our Sanscrit scholars have got hold of, and which at first was termed byMax Muller a dreary \"jungle of religious literature--the most excellenthiding-place for Lamas and Dalai-Lamas,\" is now beginning to shed a faint lighton the primitive darkness. We find this scholar stating that that which appearedat the first glance into the labyrinth of the religions of the world, alldarkness, self-deceit, and vanity begin to assume another form. \"It sounds,\" hewrites, \"like a degradation of the very name of religion, to apply it to thewild ravings of Hindu Yogins, and the blank blasphemies of Chinese Buddhists. .. . But, as we slowly and patiently wend our way through the dreary prisons, ourown eyes seem to expand, and we perceive a glimmer of light, where all wasdarkness at first.\" * As an illustration of how little even the generation which directly preceded ourown was competent to judge the religions and beliefs of the several hundredmillion Buddhists, Brahmans, and Parsees, let the student consult theadvertisement of a scientific work published in 1828 by a Professor Dunbar, thefirst scholar who has undertaken to demonstrate that the Sanscrit is derivedfrom the Greek. It appeared under the following title: \"An Inquiry into the structure and affinity of the Greek and Latin languages;with occasional comparisons of the Sanscrit and Gothic; with an Appendix, inwhich THE DERIVATION OF THE SANSCRIT FROM THE GREEK is endeavoured to beestablished. By George Dunbar, F.R.S.E., and Professor of Greek in theUniversity of Edinburgh. Price, 18s.\" * Had Max Muller happened to fall from the sky at that time, among the scholars ofthe day, and with his present knowledge, we would like to have compiled theepithets which would have been bestowed by the learned academicians upon thedaring innovator! One who, classifying languages genealogically, says that\"Sanscrit, as compared to Greek and Latin, is an elder sister . . . the earliestdeposit of Aryan speech.\" And so, we may naturally expect that in 1976, the same criticisms will be justlyapplied to many a scientific discovery, now deemed conclusive and final by ourscholars. That which is now termed the superstitious verbiage and gibberish ofmere heathens and savages, composed many thousands of years ago, may be found tocontain the master-key to all religious systems. The cautious sentence of St.Augustine, a favorite name in Max Muller's lectures, which says that \"there isno false religion which does not contain some elements of truth,\" may yet betriumphantly proved correct; the more so as, far from being original with theBishop of Hippo, it was borrowed by him from the works of Ammonius Saccas, thegreat Alexandrian teacher. This \"god-taught\" philosopher, the theodidaktos, had repeated these same wordsto exhaustion, in his numerous works some 140 years before Augustine.Acknowledging Jesus as \"an excellent man, and the friend of God,\" he alwaysmaintained that his design was not to abolish the intercourse with gods anddemons (spirits), but simply to purify the ancient religions; that \"the religionof the multitude went hand in hand with philosophy, and with her had shared thefate of being by degrees corrupted and obscured with mere human conceits,superstition, and lies: that it ought therefore to be brought back to itsoriginal purity by purging it of this dross and expounding it upon philosophicalprinciples; and that the whole which Christ had in view was to reinstate andrestore to its primitive integrity the wisdom of the ancients.\" * It was Ammonius who first taught that every religion was based on one and thesame truth; which is the wisdom found in the Books of Thoth (HermesTrismegistus), from which books Pythagoras and Plato had learned all theirphilosophy. And the doctrines of the former he affirmed to have been identicalwith the earliest teachings of the Brahmans--now embodied in the oldest Vedas.\"The name Thoth,\" says Professor Wilder, \"means a college or assembly,\" ** and\"it is not improbable that the books were so named as being the collectedoracles and doctrines of the sacerdotal fraternity of Memphis. Rabbi Wise hadsuggested a similar hypothesis in relation to the divine utterances recorded inthe Hebrew Scripture. But the Indian writers assert, that during the reign ofking Kansa, Yadus (Judeans?) or sacred tribe left India and migrated to theWest, carrying the four Vedas with them. There was certainly a great resemblancebetween the philosophical doctrines and religious customs of the Egyptians andEastern Buddhists; but whether the Hermetic books and the four Vedas wereidentical, is not now known.\" But one thing is certainly known, and that is, that before the word philosopherwas first pronounced by Pythagoras at the court of the king of the Philasians,the \"secret doctrine\" or wisdom was identical in every country. Therefore it isin the oldest texts--those least polluted by subsequent forgeries--that we haveto look for the truth. And now that philology has possessed itself of Sanscrittexts which may be boldly affirmed to be documents by far antedating the MosaicBible, it is the duty of the scholars to present the world with truth, andnothing but the truth. Without regard to either skeptical or theologicalprejudice, they are bound to impartially examine both documents--the oldestVedas and the Old Testament, and then decide which of the two is the originalSruti or Revelation, and which but the Smriti, which, as Max Muller shows, onlymeans recollection or tradition. Origen writes that the Brahmans were always famous for the wonderful cures whichthey performed by certain words; *** and in our own age we find Orioli, alearned corresponding member of the French Institute, **** corroborating thestatement of Origen in the third century, and that of Leonard de Vair of thesixteenth, in which the latter wrote: \"There are also persons, who uponpronouncing a certain sentence--a charm, walk bare-footed on red, burning coals,and on the points of sharp knives stuck in the ground; and, once poised on them,on one toe, they will lift up in the air a heavy man or any other burden ofconsiderable weight. They will tame wild horses likewise, and the most furiousbulls, with a single word.\" * This word is to be found in the Mantras of the Sanscrit Vedas, say some adepts.It is for the philologists to decide for themselves whether there is such a wordin the Vedas. So far as human evidence goes, it would seem that such magic wordsdo exist. It appears that the reverend fathers of the Order of Jesuits have picked up manysuch tricks in their missionary travels. Baldinger gives them full credit forit. The tschamping--a Hindu word, from which the modern word shampooing isderived--is a well-known magical manipulation in the East Indies. The nativesorcerers use it with success to the present day, and it is from them that thefather Jesuits derived their wisdom. Camerarius, in his Horae Subscecivae, narrates that once upon a time thereexisted a great rivalry of \"miracles\" between the Austin Friars and the Jesuits.A disputation having taken place between the father-general of the AustinFriars, who was very learned, and the general of the Jesuits, who was veryunlearned, but full of magical knowledge, the latter proposed to settle thequestion by trying their subordinates, and finding out which of them would bethe readiest to obey his superiors. Thereupon, turning to one of his Jesuits, hesaid: \"Brother Mark, our companions are cold; I command you, in virtue of theholy obedience you have sworn to me, to bring here instantly out of the kitchenfire, and in your hands, some burning coals, that they may warm themselves overyour hands.\" Father Mark instantly obeyed, and brought in both his hands asupply of red, burning coals, and held them till the company present had allwarmed themselves, after which he took them back to the kitchen hearth. Thegeneral of the Austin Friars found himself crestfallen, for none of hissubordinates would obey him so far as that. The triumph of the Jesuits was thusaccomplished. If the above is looked upon as an anecdote unworthy of credence, we will inquireof the reader what we must think of some modern \"mediums,\" who perform the samewhile entranced. The testimony of several highly respectable and trustworthywitnesses, such as Lord Adair and Mr. S. C. Hall, is unimpeachable. \"Spirits,\"the spiritualists will argue. Perhaps so, in the case of American and Englishfire-proof mediums; but not so in Thibet and India. In the West a \"sensitive\"has to be entranced before being rendered invulnerable by the presiding\"guides,\" and we defy any \"medium,\" in his or her normal physical state to burythe arms to the elbows in glowing coals. But in the East, whether the performerbe a holy lama or a mercenary sorcerer (the latter class being generally termed\"jugglers\") he needs no preparation or abnormal state to be able to handle fire,red-hot pieces of iron, or melted lead. We have seen in Southern India these\"jugglers\" keep their hands in a furnace of burning coals until the latter werereduced to cinders. During the religious ceremony of Siva-Ratri, or thevigil-night of Siva, when the people spend whole nights in watching and praying,some of the Sivaites called in a Tamil juggler, who produced the most wonderfulphenomena by simply summoning to his help a spirit whom they callKutti-Sattan--the little demon. But, far from allowing people to think he wasguided or \"controlled\" by this gnome--for it was a gnome, if it wasanything--the man, while crouching over his fiery pit, proudly rebuked aCatholic missionary, who took his opportunity to inform the bystanders that themiserable sinner \"had sold himself to Satan.\" Without removing his hands andarms from the burning coals within which he was coolly refreshing them, theTamil only turned his head and gave one arrogant look at the flushed missionary.\"My father and my father's father,\" he said, \"had this 'little one' at theircommand. For two centuries the Kutti is a faithful servant in our home, and now,Sir, you would make people believe that he is my master! But they know better.\"After this, he quietly withdrew his hands from the fire, and proceeded withother performances. As for the wonderful powers of prediction and clairvoyance possessed by certainBrahmans, they are well known to every European resident of India. If these upontheir return to \"civilized\" countries, laugh at such stories, and sometimes evendeny them outright, they only impugn their good faith, not the fact. TheseBrahmans live principally in \"sacred villages,\" and secluded places, principallyon the western coast of India. They avoid populated cities, and especiallyEuropeans, and it is but rarely that the latter can succeed in making themselvesintimate with the \"seers.\" It is generally thought that the circumstance is dueto their religious observance of the caste; but we are firmly convinced that inmany cases this is not so. Years, perhaps centuries, will roll away before thereal reason is ascertained. As to the lower castes, some of which are termed by the missionariesdevil-worshippers, notwithstanding the pious efforts on the part of the Catholicmissionaries to spread in Europe heart-rending reports of the misery of thesepeople \"sold to the Arch-Enemy\"; and like efforts, perhaps only a trifle lessridiculous and absurd, of Protestant missionaries, the word devil, in the senseunderstood by Christians, is a nonentity for them. They believe in good and badspirits; but they neither worship nor dread the Devil. Their \"worship\" is simplya ceremonial precaution against \"terrestrial\" and human spirits, whom they dreadfar more than the millions of elementals of various forms. They use all kinds ofmusic, incense, and perfumes, in their efforts to drive away the \"bad spirits\"(the elementary). In this case, they are no more to be ridiculed than thewell-known scientist, a firm spiritualist, who suggested the keeping of vitrioland powdered nitre in the room to keep away \"unpleasant spirits\"; and no morethan he, are they wrong in so doing; for the experience of their ancestors,extending over many thousands of years has taught them how to proceed againstthis vile \"spiritual horde.\" That they are human spirits is shown by the factthat very often they try to humor and propitiate the \"larvae\" of their owndaughters and relatives, when they have reason to suspect that the latter didnot die in the odor of sanctity and chastity. Such spirits they name \"Kanni,\"bad virgins. The case was noticed by several missionaries; Rev. E. Lewis, *among others. But these pious gentlemen usually insist upon it that they worshipdevils, whereas, they do nothing of the sort; for they merely try to remain ongood terms with them in order to be left unmolested. They offer them cakes andfruit, and various kinds of food which they liked while alive, for many of themhave experienced the wickedness of these returning \"dead ones,\" whosepersecutions are sometimes dreadful. On this principle likewise they act towardthe spirits of all wicked men. They leave on their tombs, if they were buried,or near the place where their remains were burnt, food and liquors, with theobject of keeping them near these places, and with the idea that these vampireswill be prevented thereby from returning to their homes. This is no worship; itis rather a spiritualism of a practical sort. Until 1861, there prevailed acustom among the Hindus of mutilating the feet of executed murderers, under thefirm belief that thereby the disembodied soul would be prevented from wanderingand doing more mischief. Subsequently, they were prohibited, by the police, fromcontinuing the practice. Another good reason why the Hindus should not worship the \"Devil\" is that theyhave no word to convey such a meaning. They call these spirits \"puttam,\" whichanswers rather to our \"spook,\" or malicious imp; another expression they use is\"pey\" and the Sanscrit pesasu, both meaning ghosts or \"returning ones\"--perhapsgoblins, in some cases. The puttam are the most terrible, for they are literally\"haunting spooks,\" who return on earth to torment the living. They are believedto visit generally the places where their bodies were burnt. The \"fire\" or\"Siva-spirits\" are identical with the Rosicrucian gnomes and salamanders; forthey are pictured as dwarfs of a fiery appearance, living in earth and fire. TheCeylonese demon called Dewel is a stout smiling female figure with a whiteElizabethan frill around the neck and a red jacket. As Dr. Warton justly observes: \"There is no character more strictly Orientalthan the dragons of romance and fiction; they are intermixed with everytradition of early date and of themselves confer a species of illustrativeevidence of origin.\" In no writings are these characters more marked, than inthe details of Buddhism; these record particulars of the Nagas, or kinglysnakes, inhabiting the cavities under the earth, corresponding with the abodesof Tiresias and the Greek seers, a region of mystery and darkness, whereinrevolves much of the system of divination and oracular response, connected withinflation, or a sort of possession, designating the spirit of Python himself,the dragon-serpent slain by Apollo. But the Buddhists no more believe in thedevil of the Christian system--that is, an entity as distinct from humanity asthe Deity itself--than the Hindus. Buddhists teach that there are inferior godswho have been men either on this or another planet, but still who were men. Theybelieve in the Nagas, who had been sorcerers on earth, bad people, and who givethe power to other bad and yet living men to blight all the fruit they lookupon, and even human lives. When a Cinghalese has the reputation that if helooks on a tree or on a person both will wither and die, he is said to have theNaga-Raja, or king-serpent on him. The whole endless catalogue of bad spiritsare not devils in the sense the Christian clergy wants us to understand, butmerely spiritually incarnated sins, crimes, and human thoughts, if we may soexpress it. The blue, green, yellow, and purple god-demons, like the inferiorgods of Jugandere, are more of the kind of presiding genii, and many are as goodand beneficient as the Nat deities themselves, although the Nats reckon in theirnumbers, giants, evil genii, and the like which inhabit the desert of MountJugandere. The true doctrine of Buddha says that the demons, when nature produced the sun,moon, and stars, were human beings, but, on account of their sins, they fellfrom the state of felicity. If they commit greater sins, they suffer greaterpunishments, and condemned men are reckoned by them among the devils; while, onthe contrary, demons who die (elemental spirits) and are born or incarnated asmen, and commit no more sin, can arrive at the state of celestial felicity.Which is a demonstration, remarks Edward Upham, in his History and Doctrine ofBuddhism, that all beings, divine as well as human, are subject to the laws oftransmigration, which are operative on all, according to a scale of moral deeds.This faith then, is a complete test of a code of moral enactments and motives,applied to the regulation and government of man, an experiment, he adds, \"whichrenders the study of Buddhism an important and curious subject for thephilosopher.\" The Hindus believe, as firmly as the Servians or Hungarians, in vampires.Furthermore, their doctrine is that of Pierart, the famous French spiritist andmesmerizer, whose school flourished some dozen years ago. \"The fact of a spectrereturning to suck human blood,\" says this Doctor, * \"is not so inexplicable asit seems, and here we appeal to the spiritualists who admit the phenomenon ofbicorporeity or soul-duplication. The hands which we have pressed . . . these'materialized' limbs, so palpable . . . prove clearly how much is possible forastral spectres under favorable conditions.\" The honorable physician expresses the theory of the kabalists. The Shadim arethe lowest of the spiritual orders. Maimonides, who tells us that his countrymenwere obliged to maintain an intimate intercourse with their departed ones,describes the feast of blood they held on such occasions. They dug a hole, andfresh blood was poured in, over which was placed a table; after which the\"spirits\" came and answered all their questions. ** Pierart, whose doctrine was founded on that of the theurgists, exhibits a warmindignation against the superstition of the clergy which requires, whenever acorpse is suspected of vampirism, that a stake should be driven through theheart. So long as the astral form is not entirely liberated from the body thereis a liability that it may be forced by magnetic attraction to reenter it.Sometimes it will be only half-way out, when the corpse, which presents theappearance of death, is buried. In such cases the terrified astral soulviolently reenters its casket; and then, one of two things happens--either theunhappy victim will writhe in the agonizing torture of suffocation, or, if hehad been grossly material, he becomes a vampire. The bicorporeal life begins;and these unfortunate buried cataleptics sustain their miserable lives by havingtheir astral bodies rob the life-blood from living persons. The ethereal formcan go wherever it pleases; and so long as it does not break the link whichattaches it to the body, it is at liberty to wander about, either visible orinvisible, and feed on human victims. \"According to all appearance, this'spirit' then transmits through a mysterious and invisible cord of connection,which perhaps, some day may be explained, the results of the suction to thematerial body which lies inert at the bottom of the tomb, aiding it, in amanner, to perpetuate the state of catalepsy.\" *** Brierre de Boismont gives a number of such cases, fully authenticated, which heis pleased to term \"hallucinations.\" A recent inquest, says a French paper, \"hasestablished that in 1871 two corpses were submitted to the infamous treatment ofpopular superstition, at the instigation of the clergy . . . O blind prejudice!\"But Dr. Pierart, quoted by des Mousseaux, who stoutly adheres to vampirism,exclaims: \"Blind, you say? Yes, blind, as much as you like. But whence sprangthese prejudices? Why are they perpetuated in all ages, and in so manycountries? After a crowd of facts of vampirism so often proved, should we saythat there are no more and that they never had a foundation? Nothing comes ofnothing. Every belief, every custom springs from facts and causes which gave itbirth. If one had never seen appear, in the bosom of families of certaincountries, beings clothing themselves in the shape of the familiar dead, comingthus to suck the blood of one or of several persons, and if the death of thevictims by emaciation had not followed, they would never have gone to disinterthe corpses in cemeteries; we would never have had attested the incredible factof persons buried for several years being found with the corpse soft, flexible,the eyes open, with rosy complexions, the mouth and nose full of blood, and ofthe blood running in torrents under blows, from wounds, and when decapitated.\" * One of the most important examples of vampirism figures in the private lettersof the philosopher, the Marquis d'Argens; and, in the Revue Britannique, forMarch, 1837, the English traveller Pashley describes some that came under hisnotice in the island of Candia. Dr. Jobard, the anti-Catholic and anti-spiritualBelgian savant, testifies to similar experiences. ** \"I will not examine,\" wrote the Bishop d'Avranches Huet, \"whether the facts ofvampirism, which are constantly being reported, are true, or the fruit of apopular error; but it is certain that they are testified to by so many authors,able and trustworthy, and by so many eye-witnesses, that no one ought to decideupon the question without a good deal of caution.\" *** The chevalier, who went to great pains to collect materials for hisdemonological theory, brings the most thrilling instances to prove that all suchcases are produced by the Devil, who uses graveyard corpses with which to clothehimself, and roams at night sucking people's blood. Methinks we could do verywell without bringing this dusky personage upon the scene. If we are to believeat all in the return of spirits, there are plenty of wicked sensualists, misers,and sinners of other descriptions--especially suicides, who could have rivalledthe Devil himself in malice in his best days. It is quite enough to be actuallyforced to believe in what we do see, and know to be a fact, namely spirits,without adding to our Pantheon of ghosts the Devil--whom nobody ever saw. Still, there are interesting particulars to be gathered in relation tovampirism, since belief in this phenomenon has existed in all countries, fromthe remotest ages. The Slavonian nations, the Greeks, the Wallachians, and theServians would rather doubt the existence of their enemies, the Turks, than thefact that there are vampires. The broucolak, or vourdalak, as the latter arecalled, are but too familiar guests at the Slavonian fireside. Writers of thegreatest ability, men as full of sagacity as of high integrity, have treated ofthe subject and believed in it. Whence, then, such a superstition? Whence thatunanimous credence throughout the ages, and whence that identity in details andsimilarity of description as to that one particular phenomenon which we find inthe testimony--generally sworn evidence--of peoples foreign to each other anddiffering widely in matters concerning other superstitions. \"There are,\" says Dom Calmet, a skeptical Benedictine monk of the last century,\"two different ways to destroy the belief in these pretended ghosts. . . . Thefirst would be to explain the prodigies of vampirism by physical causes. Thesecond way is to deny totally the truth of all such stories; and the latter planwould be undoubtedly the most certain, as the most wise.\" * The first way--that of explaining it by physical, though occult causes, is theone adopted by the Pierart school of mesmerism. It is certainly not thespiritualists who have a right to doubt the plausibility of this explanation.The second plan is that adopted by scientists and skeptics. They denypoint-blank. As des Mousseaux remarks, there is no better or surer way, and noneexacts less of either philosophy or science. The spectre of a village herdsman, near Kodom, in Bavaria, began appearing toseveral inhabitants of the place, and either in consequence of their fright orsome other cause, every one of them died during the following week. Driven todespair, the peasants disinterred the corpse, and pinned it to the ground with along stake. The same night he appeared again, plunging people into convulsionsof fright, and suffocating several of them. Then the village authoritiesdelivered the body into the hands of the executioner, who carried it to aneighboring field and burned it. \"The corpse,\" says des Mousseaux, quoting DomCalmet, \"howled like a madman, kicking and tearing as if he had been alive. Whenhe was run through again with sharp-pointed stakes, he uttered piercing cries,and vomited masses of crimson blood. The apparitions of this spectre ceased onlyafter the corpse had been reduced to ashes.\" * Officers of justice visited the places said to be so haunted; the bodies wereexhumed, and in nearly every case it was observed that the corpse suspected ofvampirism looked healthy and rosy, and the flesh was in no way decaying. Theobjects which had belonged to these ghosts were observed moving about the housewithout any one touching them. But the legal authorities generally refused toresort to cremation and beheading before they had observed the strictest rulesof legal procedure. Witnesses were summoned to appear, and evidence was heardand carefully weighed. After that the exhumed corpses were examined; and if theyexhibited the unequivocal and characteristic signs of vampirism, they werehanded over to the executioner. \"But,\" argues Dom Calmet, ** \"the principal difficulty consists in learning howthese vampires can quit their tombs, and how they reenter them, withoutappearing to have disturbed the earth in the least; how is it that they are seenwith their usual clothing; how can they go about, and walk, and eat? . . . Ifthis is all imagination on the part of those who believe themselves molested bysuch vampires, how happens it that the accused ghosts are subsequently found intheir graves . . . exhibiting no signs of decay, full of blood, supple andfresh? How explain the cause of their feet found muddy and covered with dirt onthe day following the night they had appeared and frightened their neighbors,while nothing of the sort was ever found on other corpses buried in the samecemetery? *** How is it again that once burned they never reappear? and thatthese cases should happen so often in this country that it is found impossibleto cure people from this prejudice; for, instead of being destroyed, dailyexperience only fortifies the superstition in the people, and increases beliefin it.\" **** There is a phenomenon in nature unknown, and therefore rejected by physiologyand psychology in our age of unbelief. This phenomenon is a state of half-death.Virtually, the body is dead; and, in cases of persons in whom matter does notpredominate over spirit and wickedness not so great as to destroy spirituality,if left alone, their astral soul will disengage itself by gradual efforts, and,when the last link is broken, it finds itself separated forever from its earthlybody. Equal magnetic polarity will violently repulse the ethereal man from thedecaying organic mass. The whole difficulty lies in that 1, the ultimate momentof separation between the two is believed to be that when the body is declareddead by science; and 2, a prevailing unbelief in the existence of either soul orspirit in man, by the same science. Pierart tries to demonstrate that in every case it is dangerous to bury peopletoo soon, even though the body may show undoubted signs of putrefaction. \"Poordead cataleptics,\" says the doctor, \"buried as if quite dead, in cold and dryspots where morbid causes are incapable to effect the destruction of theirbodies, their (astral) spirit enveloping itself with a fluidic body (ethereal)is prompted to quit the precincts of its tomb, and to exercise on living beingsacts peculiar to physical life, especially that of nutrition, the result ofwhich, by a mysterious link between soul and body, which spiritualistic sciencewill explain some day, is forwarded to the material body lying still in itstomb, and the latter thus helped to perpetuate its vital existence.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu011.htm#fn_644] These spirits, in theirephemeral bodies, have been often seen coming out from the graveyard; they areknown to have clung to their living neighbors, and have sucked their blood.Judicial inquiry has established that from this resulted an emaciation of thevictimized persons, which often terminated in death. Thus, following the pious advice of Dom Calmet, we must either go on denying,or, if human and legal testimonies are worth anything, accept the onlyexplanation possible. \"That souls departed are embodied in aerial or aetherialvehicles is most fully and plainly proved by those excellent men, Dr. C. and Dr.More,\" says Glanvil, \"and they have largely shown that this was the doctrine ofthe greatest philosophers and most ancient and aged fathers.\" ** Gorres, the German philosopher, says to the same effect, that \"God never createdman as a dead corpse, but as an animal full of life. Once He had thus producedhim, finding him ready to receive the immortal breath, He breathed him in theface, and thus man became a double masterpiece in His hands. It is in the centreof life itself that this mysterious insufflation took place in the first man(race?); and thence were united the animal soul issued from earth, and thespirit emanating from heaven.\" *** Des Mousseaux, in company with other Roman Catholic writers, exclaims: \"Thisproposition is utterly anti-Catholic! \"Well, and suppose it is? It may bearchi-anti-Catholic, and still be logic, and offer a solution for many apsychological puzzle. The sun of science and philosophy shines for every one;and if Catholics, who hardly number one-seventh part of the population of theglobe, do not feel satisfied, perhaps the many millions of people of otherreligions who outnumber them, will. And now, before parting with this repulsive subject of vampirism, we will giveone more illustration, without other voucher than the statement that it wasgiven to us by apparently trustworthy witnesses. About the beginning of the present century, there occurred in Russia, one of themost frightful cases of vampirism on record. The governor of the Province ofTch---- was a man of about sixty years, of a malicious, tyrannical, cruel, andjealous disposition. Clothed with despotic authority, he exercised it withoutstint, as his brutal instincts prompted. He fell in love with the prettydaughter of a subordinate official. Although the girl was betrothed to a youngman whom she loved, the tyrant forced her father to consent to his having hermarry him; and the poor victim, despite her despair, became his wife. Hisjealous disposition exhibited itself. He beat her, confined her to her room forweeks together, and prevented her seeing any one except in his presence. Hefinally fell sick and died. Finding his end approaching, he made her swear neverto marry again; and with fearful oaths, threatened that, in case she did, hewould return from his grave and kill her. He was buried in the cemetery acrossthe river; and the young widow experienced no further annoyance, until, naturegetting the better of her fears, she listened to the importunities of her formerlover, and they were again betrothed. On the night of the customary betrothal-feast, when all had retired, the oldmansion was aroused by shrieks proceeding from her room. The doors were burstopen, and the unhappy woman was found lying on her bed, in a swoon. At the sametime a carriage was heard rumbling out of the courtyard. Her body was found tobe black and blue in places, as from the effect of pinches, and from a slightpuncture on her neck drops of blood were oozing. Upon recovering, she statedthat her deceased husband had suddenly entered her room, appearing exactly as inlife, with the exception of a dreadful pallor; that he had upbraided her for herinconstancy, and then beaten and pinched her most cruelly. Her story wasdisbelieved; but the next morning, the guard stationed at the other end of thebridge which spans the river, reported that, just before midnight, a black coachand six had driven furiously past them, toward the town, without answering theirchallenge. The new governor, who disbelieved the story of the apparition, took neverthelessthe precaution of doubling the guards across the bridge. The same thing happened, however, night after night; the soldiers declaring thatthe toll-bar at their station near the bridge would rise of itself, and thespectral equipage sweep by them despite their efforts to stop it. At the sametime every night, the coach would rumble into the courtyard of the house; thewatchers, including the widow's family, and the servants, would be thrown into aheavy sleep; and every morning the young victim would be found bruised,bleeding, and swooning as before. The town was thrown into consternation. Thephysicians had no explanations to offer; priests came to pass the night inprayer, but as midnight approached, all would be seized with the terriblelethargy. Finally, the archbishop of the province came, and performed theceremony of exorcism in person, but the following morning the governor's widowwas found worse than ever. She was now brought to death's door. The governor was finally driven to take the severest measures to stop theever-increasing panic in the town. He stationed fifty Cossacks along the bridge,with orders to stop the spectre-carriage at all hazards. Promptly at the usualhour, it was heard and seen approaching from the direction of the cemetery. Theofficer of the guard, and a priest bearing a crucifix, planted themselves infront of the toll-bar, and together shouted: \"In the name of God, and the Czar,who goes there?\" Out of the coach-window was thrust a well-remembered head, anda familiar voice responded: \"The Privy Councillor of State and Governor, C----!\"At the same moment, the officer, the priest, and the soldiers were flung asideas by an electric shock, and the ghostly equipage passed by them, before theycould recover breath. The archbishop then resolved, as a last expedient, to resort to the time-honoredplan of exhuming the body, and pinning it to the earth with an oaken stakedriven through its heart. This was done with great religious ceremony in thepresence of the whole populace. The story is that the body was found gorged withblood, and with red cheeks and lips. At the instant that the first blow wasstruck upon the stake, a groan issued from the corpse, and a jet of bloodspurted high into the air. The archbishop pronounced the usual exorcism, thebody was reinterred, and from that time no more was heard of the vampire. How far the facts of this case may have been exaggerated by tradition, we cannotsay. But we had it years ago from an eye-witness; and at the present day thereare families in Russia whose elder members will recall the dreadful tale. As to the statement found in medical books that there are frequent cases ofinhumation while the subjects are but in a cataleptic state, and the persistentdenials of specialists that such things happen, except very rarely, we have butto turn to the daily press of every country to find the horrid factsubstantiated. The Rev. H. R. Haweis, M.A., author of Ashes to Ashes, *enumerates in his work, written in advocacy of cremation, some very distressingcases of premature burial. On page forty-six occurs the following dialogue: \"But do you know of many cases of premature burial?\" \"Undoubtedly I do. I will not say that in our temperate climate they arefrequent, but they do occur. Hardly a graveyard is opened but coffins are foundcontaining bodies not only turned, but skeletons contorted in the last hopelessstruggle for life underground. The turning may be due to some clumsy shaking ofthe coffin, but not the contortion.\" After this he proceeds to give the following recent cases: \"At Bergerac (Dordogne), in 1842, the patient took a sleeping draught . . . buthe woke not. . . . They bled him, and he woke not. . . . At last they declaredhim to be dead, and buried him. After a few days, remembering the sleepingdraught, they opened the grave. The body had turned and struggled.\" \"The Sunday Times, December 30, 1838, relates that at Tonneins, Lower Garonne, aman was buried, when an indistinct noise proceeded from the coffin; the recklessgrave-digger fled. . . . The coffin was hauled up and burst open. A facestiffened in terror and despair, a torn winding-sheet, contorted limbs, told thesad truth--too late.\" \"The Times, May, 1874, states that in August of 1873, a young lady died soonafter her marriage. . . . Within a year the husband married again, and themother of his first bride resolved to remove her daughter's body to Marseilles.They opened the vault and found the poor girl's body prostrate, her hairdishevelled, her shroud torn to pieces.\" ** As we will have to refer to the subject once more in connection with Biblemiracles, we will leave it for the present, and return to magical phenomena. If we were to give a full description of the various manifestations which takeplace among adepts in India and other countries, we might fill volumes, but thiswould be profitless, as there would remain no space for explanation. Thereforewe select in preference such as either find their parallels in modern phenomenaor are authenticated by legal inquiry. Horst tried to present an idea of certainPersian spirits to his readers, and failed; for the bare mention of some of themis calculated to set the brains of a believer in a whirl. There are the Devs andtheir specialities; the Darwands and their gloomy tricks; the Shadim andDjinnas; the whole vast legion of spirits, demons, goblins, and elves of thePersian calendar; and, on the other hand, the Jewish Seraphim, Cherubim, Izeds,Amshaspands, Sephiroth, Malachim, Elohim; and, adds Horst, \"the millions ofastral and elementary spirits, of intermediary spirits, ghosts, and imaginarybeings of all races and colors.\" * But the majority of these spirits have naught to do with the phenomenaconsciously and deliberately produced by the Eastern magicians. The latterrepudiate such an accusation and leave to sorcerers the help even of elementalspirits and the elementary spooks. The adept has an unlimited power over both,but he rarely uses it. For the production of physical phenomena he summons thenature-spirits as obedient powers, not as intelligences. As we always like to strengthen our arguments by testimonies other than our own,it may be well to present the opinion of a daily paper, the Boston Herald, as tophenomena in general and mediums in particular. Having encountered sad failureswith some dishonest persons, who may or may not be mediumistic, the writer wentto the trouble of ascertaining as to some wonders said to be produced in India,and compares them with those of modern thaumaturgy. \"The medium of the present day,\" he says, \"bears a closer resemblance, inmethods and manipulations, to the well-known conjurer of history, than any otherrepresentative of the magic art. How far short he still remains of theperformances of his prototypes is illustrated below. In 1615 a delegation ofhighly-educated and distinguished men from the English East India Companyvisited the Emperor Jehangire. While on their mission they witnessed many mostwonderful performances, almost causing them to discredit their senses, and farbeyond any hint even of solution. A party of Bengalese conjurers and jugglers,showing their art before the emperor, were desired to produce upon the spot, andfrom seed, ten mulberry trees. They immediately planted ten seeds, which, in afew minutes produced as many trees. The ground divided over the spot where aseed was planted, tiny leaves appeared, at once followed by slender shoots,which rapidly gained elevation, putting out leaves and twigs and branches,finally spreading wide in the air, budding, blossoming and yielding fruit, whichmatured upon the spot, and was found to be excellent. And this before thebeholder had turned away his eyes. Fig, almond, mango, and walnut trees were atthe same time under like conditions produced, yielding the fruit which belongedto each. Wonder succeeded wonder. The branches were filled with birds ofbeautiful plumage flitting about among the leaves and singing sweet notes. Theleaves turned to russet, fell from their places, branches and twigs withered,and finally the trees sank back into the earth, out of which they had all sprungwithin the hour. \"Another had a bow and about fifty steel-pointed arrows. He shot an arrow intothe air, when, lo! the arrow became fixed in space at a considerable height.Another and another arrow was sent off, each fixing itself in the shaft of thepreceding, until all formed a chain of arrows in the air, excepting the lastshot, which, striking the chain, brought the whole to the ground in detachments. \"They set up two common tents facing each other, and about a bow-shot apart.These tents were critically examined by the spectators, as are the cabinets ofthe mediums, and pronounced empty. The tents were fastened to the ground allaround. The lookers-on were then invited to choose what animals or birds theywould have issue from these tents to engage in a battle. Khaun-e-Jahaunincredulously asked to see a fight between ostriches. In a few minutes anostrich came out from each tent rushed to combat with deadly earnestness, andfrom them the blood soon began to stream; but they were so nearly matched thatneither could win the victory, and they were at last separated by the conjurersand conveyed within the tents. After this the varied demands of the spectatorsfor birds and animals were exactly complied with, always with the same results. \"A large cauldron was set, and into it a quantity of rice thrown. Without thesign of fire this rice soon began to boil, and out from the cauldron was takenmore than one hundred platters of cooked rice, with a stewed fowl at the top ofeach. This trick is performed on a smaller scale by the most ordinary fakirs ofthe present day. \"But space fails to give opportunity for illustrating, from the records of thepast, how the miserably tame performances--by comparison--of the mediums of thepresent day were pale and overshadowed by those of other days and more adroitpeoples. There is not a wonderful feature in any of the so-called phenomena ormanifestations which was not, nay, which is not now more than duplicated byother skilful performers, whose connection with earth, and earth alone, is tooevident to be doubted, even if the fact was not supported by their owntestimony.\" It is an error to say that fakirs or jugglers will always claim that they arehelped by spirits. In quasi-religious evocations, such as Jacolliot'sKovindasami is described to have produced before this French gentleman, when theparties desire to see real \"spiritual\" manifestations, they will resort toPitris, their disembodied ancestors, and other pure spirits. These they canevoke but through prayer. As to all other phenomena, they are produced by themagician and fakir at will. Notwithstanding the state of apparent abjectness inwhich the latter lives, he is often an initiate of the temples, and is as wellacquainted with occultism as his richer brethren. The Chaldeans, whom Cicero counts among the oldest magicians, placed the basisof all magic in the inner powers of man's soul, and by the discernment of magicproperties in plants, minerals, and animals. By the aid of these they performedthe most wonderful \"miracles.\" Magic, with them, was synonymous with religionand science. It is but later that the religious myths of the Magdean dualism,disfigured by Christian theology and euhemerized by certain fathers of theChurch, assumed the disgusting shape in which we find them expounded by suchCatholic writers as des Mousseaux. The objective reality of the mediaevalincubus and succubus, that abominable superstition of the middle ages which costso many human lives, advocated by this author in a whole volume, is themonstrous production of religious fanaticism and epilepsy. It can have noobjective form; and to attribute its effects to the Devil is blasphemy: implyingthat God, after creating Satan, would allow him to adopt such a course. If weare forced to believe in vampirism, it is on the strength of two irrefragablepropositions of occult psychological science: 1. The astral soul is a separabledistinct entity of our ego, and can roam far away from the body without breakingthe thread of life. 2. The corpse is not utterly dead, and while it can yet bereentered by its tenant, the latter can gather sufficient material emanationsfrom it to enable itself to appear in a quasi-terrestrial shape. But to uphold,with des Mousseaux and de Mirville, that the Devil, whom the Catholics endowwith a power which, in antagonism, equals that of the Supreme Deity, transformshimself into wolves, snakes, and dogs, to satisfy his lust and procreatemonsters, is an idea within which lie hidden the germs of devil-worship, lunacy,and sacrilege. The Catholic Church, which not only teaches us to believe in thismonstrous fallacy, but forces her missionaries to preach such a dogma, need notrevolt against the devil-worship of some Parsee and South India sects. Quite thereverse; for when we hear the Yezides repeat the well-known proverb: \"Keepfriends with the demons; give them your property, your blood, your service, andyou need not care about God--He will not harm you,\" we find him but consistentwith his belief and reverential to the Supreme; his logic is sound and rational;he reveres God too deeply to imagine that He who created the universe and itslaws is able to hurt him, poor atom; but the demons are there; they areimperfect, and therefore he has good reasons to dread them. Therefore, the Devil, in his various transformations, can be but a fallacy. Whenwe imagine that we see, and hear, and feel him, it is but too often thereflection of our own wicked, depraved, and polluted soul that we see, hear, andfeel. Like attracts like, they say; thus, according to the mood in which ourastral form oozes out during the hours of sleep, according to our thoughts,pursuits, and daily occupations, all of which are fairly impressed upon theplastic capsule called the human soul, the latter attracts around itselfspiritual beings congenial to itself. Hence some dreams and visions that arepure and beautiful, others fiendish and beastly. The person awakes, and eitherhastens to the confessional, or laughs in callous indifference at the thought.In the first case, he is promised final salvation, at the cost of someindulgences (which he has to purchase from the church), and perhaps a littletaste of purgatory, or even of hell. What matter? is he not safe to be eternaland immortal, do what he may? It is the Devil. Away with him, with bell, book,and holy sprinkler! But the \"Devil\" comes back, and often the true believer isforced to disbelieve in God, when he clearly perceives that the Devil has thebest of his Creator and Master. Then he is left to the second emergency. Heremains indifferent, and gives himself up entirely to the Devil. He dies, andthe reader has learned the sequel in the preceding chapters. The thought is beautifully expressed by Dr. Ennemoser: \"Religion did not here[Europe and China] strike root so deeply as among the Hindus,\" says he, arguingupon this superstition. \"The spirit of the Greeks and Persians was morevolatile. . . . The philosophical idea in the good and bad principle, and of thespiritual world . . . must have assisted tradition in forming visions ofheavenly and hellish shapes, and the most frightful distortions, which in Indiawere much more simply produced by a more enthusiastic fanaticism; there the seerreceived by divine light; here he lost himself in a multitude of outwardobjects, with which he confounded his own identity. Convulsions, accompanied bythe mind's absence from the body, in distant countries, were here common, forthe imagination was less firm, and also less spiritual. \"The outward causes are also different; the modes of life, geographicalposition, and artificial means producing various modifications. The mode of lifein Western countries has always been very variable, and therefore disturbs anddistorts the occupation of the senses, and the outward life is thereforereflected upon the inner dream-world. The spirits, therefore, are of endlessvarieties of shape, and incline men to gratify their passions, showing them themeans of so doing, and descending even to the minutest particulars, which was sofar below the elevated natures of Indian seers.\" Let the student of occult sciences make his own nature as pure and his thoughtsas elevated as those of these Indian seers, and he may sleep unmolested byvampire, incubus, or succubus. Around the insensible form of such a sleeper theimmortal spirit sheds a power divine that protects it from evil approaches, asthough it were a crystal wall. \"Haec murus aeneus esto: nil conscire sibi, nulla pallascere culpa.\" [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES418:* \"On the Scientific Use of the Imagination.\" 419:* Epes Sargent.

Notwithstanding the lesson of caution which more than oneunexpected discovery has taught them, they still pursue their old plan ofdenying, and, what is still worse, of ridiculing that which they have no meansof either proving or disproving. So, for instance, they will pooh-pooh the ideaof talismans having any efficacy one way or the other. That the seven spirits ofthe Apocalypse have direct relation to the seven occult powers in nature,appears incomprehensible and absurd to their feeble intellects; and the barethought of a magician claiming to work wonders through certain kabalistic ritesconvulses them with laughter. Perceiving only a geometrical figure traced upon apaper, a bit of metal, or other substance, they cannot imagine how anyreasonable being should ascribe to either any occult potency. But those who havetaken the pains to inform themselves know that the ancients achieved as greatdiscoveries in psychology as in physics, and that their explorations left fewsecrets to be discovered. For our part, when we realize that a pentacle is a synthetic figure whichexpresses in concrete form a profound truth of nature, we can see nothing moreridiculous in it than in the figures of Euclid, and nothing half so comical asthe symbols in a modern work on chemistry. What to the uninitiated reader canappear more absurd than that the symbol NA[2]CO[2],--means soda! and thatC[2]H[6]O is but another way of writing alcohol! How very amusing that thealchemists should express their Azoth, or creative principle of nature (astrallight), by the symbol [images/00005.jpg] which embraces three things: 1st, The divine hypothesis; 2d, The philosophicalsynthesis; 3d, The physical synthesis--that is to say, a belief, an idea, and aforce. But how perfectly natural that a modern chemist who wishes to indicate tothe students in his laboratory the reaction of a sodic-carbonate withcream-of-tartar in solution, should employ the following symbol: (Na[2]CO[3]+2HKC[4]H[4]O[6]+Aq)=(2NaKC[4]H[4]O[6],+H[2]O+Aq) +CO[2]If the uninspired reader may be pardoned for looking aghast at this abracadabraof chemical science, why should not its teachers restrain their mirth until theyhave learned the philosophical value of the symbolism of the ancients? At leastthey might spare themselves from being as ridiculous as Monsieur de Mirville,who, confounding the Azoth of the Hermetic philosophers with the azote of thechemists, asserted that the former worshipped nitrogen gas! *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_650] Apply a piece of iron to a magnet, and it becomes imbued with its subtileprinciple and capable of imparting it to other iron in its turn. It neitherweighs more nor appears different from what it was before. And yet, one of themost subtile potencies of nature has entered into its substance. A talisman, initself perhaps a worthless bit of metal, a scrap of paper, or a shred of anyfabric, has nevertheless been imbued by the influence of that greatest of allmagnets, the human will, with a potency for good or ill just as recognizable andas real in its effects as the subtile property which the iron acquired bycontact with the physical magnet. Let the bloodhound snuff an article ofclothing that has been worn by the fugitive, and he will track him through swampand forest to his hiding-place. Give one of Professor Buchanan's \"psychometers\"a manuscript, no matter how old, and he will describe to you the character ofthe writer, and perhaps even his personal appearance. Hand a clairvoyant a lockof hair or some article that has been in contact with the person of whom it isdesired to know something, and she will come into sympathy with him so intimatethat she may trace him through his whole life. Breeders tell us that young animals should not be herded with old ones; andintelligent physicians forbid parents to have young children occupy their ownbeds. When David was old and feeble his vital forces were recruited by having ayoung person brought in close contact with him so that he could absorb herstrength. The late Empress of Russia, the sister of the present German Emperor,was so feeble the last years of her life that she was seriously advised by herphysicians to keep in her bed at night a robust and healthy young peasant-girl.Whoever has read the description given by Dr. Kerner of the Seeress of Prevorst,Mme. Hauffe, must well remember her words. She repeatedly stated that shesupported life merely on the atmosphere of the people surrounding her and theirmagnetic emanations, which were quickened in an extraordinary way by herpresence. The seeress was very plainly a magnetic vampire, who absorbed bydrawing to herself the life of those who were strong enough to spare her theirvitality in the shape of volatilized blood. Dr. Kerner remarks that thesepersons were all more or less affected by this forcible loss. With these familiar illustrations of the possibility of a subtile fluidcommunicated from one individual to another, or to substances which he touches,it becomes less difficult to understand that by a determined concentration ofthe will an otherwise inert object may become imbued with protective ordestructive power according to the purpose directing. A magnetic emanation, unconsciously produced, is sure to be overpowered by anystronger one with which it may come into opposition. But when an intelligent andpowerful will directs the blind force, and concentrates it upon a given spot,the weaker emanation will often master the stronger. A human will has the sameeffect on the Akasa. Upon one occasion, we witnessed in Bengal an exhibition of will-power thatillustrates a highly interesting phase of the subject. An adept in magic made afew passes over a piece of common tin, the inside of a dish-cover, that layconveniently by, and while regarding it attentively for a few moments, seemed tograsp the imponderable fluid by handfuls and throw it against the surface. Whenthe tin had been exposed to the full glare of light for about six seconds, thebright surface was suddenly covered as with a film. Then patches of a darker huebegan coming out on its surface; and when in about three minutes the tin washanded back to us, we found imprinted upon it a picture, or rather a photograph,of the landscape that stretched out before us; faithful as nature itself, andevery color perfect. It remained for about forty-eight hours and then slowlyfaded away. This phenomenon is easily explained. The will of the adept condensed upon thetin a film of akasa which made it for the time being like a sensitizedphotographic plate. Light did the rest. Such an exhibition as this of the potency of the will to effect even objectivephysical results, will prepare the student to comprehend its efficacy in thecure of disease by imparting the desired virtue to inanimate objects which areplaced in contact with the patient. When we see such psychologists as Maudsley *quoting, without contradiction, the stories of some miraculous cures effected bySwedenborg's father--stories which do not differ from hundreds of other cures byother \"fanatics\"--as he calls them--magicians, and natural healers, and, withoutattempting to explain their facts, stooping to laugh at the intensity of theirfaith, without asking himself whether the secret of that healing potency werenot in the control given by that faith over occult forces--we grieve that thereshould be so much learning and so little philosophy, in our time. Upon our word, we cannot see that the modern chemist is any less a magician thanthe ancient theurgist or Hermetic philosopher, except in this: that the latter,recognizing the duality of nature, had twice as wide a field for experimentalresearch as the chemist. The ancients animated statues, and the Hermetistscalled into being, out of the elements, the shapes of salamanders, gnomes,undines, and sylphs, which they did not pretend to create, but simply to makevisible by holding open the door of nature, so that, under favoring conditions,they might step into view. The chemist brings into contact two elementscontained in the atmosphere, and by developing a latent force of affinity,creates a new body--water. In the spheroidal and diaphanous pearls which areborn of this union of gases, come the germs of organic life, and in theirmolecular interstices lurk heat, electricity, and light, just as they do in thehuman body. Whence comes this life into the drop of water just born of the unionof two gases? And what is the water itself? Have the oxygen and hydrogenundergone some transformation which obliterates their qualities simultaneouslywith the obliteration of their form? Here is the answer of modern science:\"Whether the oxygen and hydrogen exist as such, in the water, or whether theyare produced by some unknown and unconceived transformation of its substance, isa question about which we may speculate, but in regard to which we have noknowledge.\" ** Knowing nothing about so simple a matter as the molecularconstitution of water, or the deeper problem of the appearance of life withinit, would it not be well for Mr. Maudsley to exemplify his own principle, and\"maintain a calm acquiescence in ignorance until light comes\"? * The claims of the friends of esoteric science, that Paracelsus produced,chemically, homunculi from certain combinations as yet unknown to exact science,are, as a matter of course, relegated to the storehouse of exploded humbugs. Butwhy should they? If the homunculi were not made by Paracelsus they weredeveloped by other adepts, and that not a thousand years ago. They wereproduced, in fact, upon exactly the same principle as that by which the chemistand physicist calls to life his animalcula. A few years ago, an Englishgentleman, Andrew Crosse, of Somersetshire produced acari in the followingmanner: \"Black flint burned to redness and reduced to powder was mixed withcarbonate of potash, and exposed to a strong heat for fifteen minutes; and themixture was poured into a blacklead crucible in an air furnace. It was reducedto powder while warm, mixed with boiling water; kept boiling for some minutes,and then hydrochloric acid was added to supersaturation. After being exposed tovoltaic action for twenty-six days, a perfect insect of the acari tribe made itsappearance, and in the course of a few weeks about a hundred more. Theexperiment was repeated with other chemical fluids with like results.\" A Mr.Weeks also produced the acari in ferrocyanide of potassium. This discovery produced a great excitement. Mr. Crosse was now accused ofimpiety and aiming at creation. He replied, denying the implication and sayinghe considered \"to create was to form a something out of a nothing.\" ** Another gentleman, considered by several persons as a man of great science, hastold us repeatedly that he was on the eve of proving that even unfructified eggscould be hatched by having a negative electric current caused to pass throughthem. The mandrakes (dudim or love-fruit) found in the field by Reuben, Jacob's son,which excited the fancy of Rachel, was the kabalistic mandragora,notwithstanding denial; and the verses which refer to it belong to the crudestpassages, in their esoteric meaning, of the whole work. The mandrake is a planthaving the rudimentary shape of a human creature; with a head, two arms, and twolegs forming roots. The superstition that when pulled out of the ground it crieswith a human voice, is not utterly baseless. It does produce a kind of squeakingsound, on account of the resinous substance of its root, which it is ratherdifficult to extract; and it has more than one hidden property in it perfectlyunknown to the botanist. The reader who would obtain a clear idea of the commutation of forces and theresemblance between the life-principles of plants, animals, and human beings,may profitably consult a paper on the correlation of nervous and mental forcesby Professor Alexander Bain, of the University of Aberdeen. This mandragoraseems to occupy upon earth the point where the vegetable and animal kingdomstouch, as the zoophites and polypi do in the sea; the boundary being in eachcase so indistinct as to make it almost imperceptible where the one ceases andthe other begins. It may seem improbable that there should be homunculi, butwill any naturalist, in view of the recent expansion of science, dare say it isimpossible? \"Who,\" says Bain, \"is to limit the possibilities of existence?\" The unexplained mysteries of nature are many and of those presumably explainedhardly one may be said to have become absolutely intelligible. There is not aplant or mineral which has disclosed the last of its properties to thescientists. What do the naturalists know of the intimate nature of the vegetableand mineral kingdoms? How can they feel confident that for every one of thediscovered properties there may not be many powers concealed in the inner natureof the plant or stone? And that they are only waiting to be brought in relationwith some other plant, mineral, or force of nature to manifest themselves inwhat is termed a \"supernatural manner.\" Wherever Pliny, the naturalist, AElian,and even Diodorus, who sought with such a laudable perseverance to extricatehistorical truth from its medley of exaggerations and fables, have attributed tosome plant or mineral an occult property unknown to our modern botanists andphysicists, their assertions have been laid aside without further ceremony asabsurd, and no more referred to. It has been the speculation of men of science from time immemorial what thisvital force or life-principle is. To our mind the \"secret doctrine\" alone isable to furnish the clew. Exact science recognizes only five powers innature--one molar, and four molecular; kabalists, seven; and in these twoadditional ones is enwrapped the whole mystery of life. One of these is immortalspirit, whose reflection is connected by invisible links even with inorganicmatter; the other, we leave to every one to discover for himself. Says ProfessorJoseph Le Conte: \"What is the nature of the difference between the livingorganism and the dead organism? We can detect none, physical or chemical. Allthe physical and chemical forces withdrawn from the common fund of nature, andembodied in the living organism, seem to be still embodied in the dead, untillittle by little it is returned by decomposition. Yet the difference is immense,is inconceivably great. What is the nature of this difference expressed in theformula of material science? What is that that is gone, and whither is it gone?There is something here that science cannot yet understand. Yet it is just thisloss which takes place in death, and before decomposition, which is in thehighest sense vital force!\" * Difficult, nay impossible, as it seems to science to find out the invisible,universal motor of all--Life, to explain its nature, or even to suggest areasonable hypothesis for the same, the mystery is but half a mystery, notmerely for the great adepts and seers, but even for true and firm believers in aspiritual world. To the simple believer, unblessed with a personal organism, thedelicate, nervous sensitiveness of which would enable him--as it enables aseer--to perceive the visible universe reflected as in a clear glass in theInvisible one, and, as it were, objectively, there remains divine faith. Thelatter is firmly rooted in his inner senses; in his unerring intuition, withwhich cold reason has naught to do, he feels it cannot play him false. Lethuman-born, erroneous dogmas, and theological sophistry contradict each other;let one crowd off the other, and the subtile casuistry of one creed fell to theground the crafty reasoning of another one; truth remains one, and there is nota religion, whether Christian or heathen, that is not firmly built upon the rockof ages--God and immortal spirit. Every animal is more or less endowed with the faculty of perceiving, if notspirits, at least something which remains for the time being invisible to commonmen, and can only be discerned by a clairvoyant. We have made hundreds ofexperiments with cats, dogs, monkeys of various kinds, and, once, with a tametiger. A round black mirror, known as the \"magic crystal,\" was stronglymesmerized by a native Hindu gentleman, formerly an inhabitant of Dindigul, andnow residing in a more secluded spot, among the mountains known as the WesternGhauts. He had tamed a young cub, brought to him from the Malabar coast, inwhich part of India the tigers are proverbially ferocious; and it is with thisinteresting animal that we made our experiments. Like the ancient Marsi and Psylli, the renowned serpent-charmers, this gentlemanclaimed to be possessed of the mysterious power of taming any kind of animal.The tiger was reduced to a chronic mental numbness, so to say; he had become asinoffensive and harmless as a dog. Children could tease and pull him by theears, and he would only shake himself and howl like a dog. But whenever forcedto look into the \"magic mirror,\" the poor animal was instantly excited to a sortof frenzy. His eyes became full of a human terror; howling in despair, unable toturn away from the mirror to which his gaze seemed riveted as by a magneticspell, he would writhe and tremble till he convulsed with fear at some visionwhich to us remained unknown. He would then lie down, feebly groaning but stillgazing in the glass. When it was taken away from him, the animal would liepanting and seemingly prostrated for about two hours. What did he see? Whatspirit-picture from his own invisible, animal-world, could produce such aterrific effect on the wild and naturally ferocious and daring beast? Who cantell? Perhaps he who produced the scene. The same effect on animals was observed during spiritual seances with some holymendicants; the same when a Syrian, half-heathen and half-Christian, fromKunankulam (Cochin State), a reputed sorcerer, who was invited to join us forthe sake of experimenting. We were nine persons in all--seven men and two women, one of the latter anative. Besides us, there were in the room, the young tiger, intensely occupiedon a bone; a wanderoo, or lion-monkey, which, with its black coat and snow-whitegoatee and whiskers, and cunning, sparkling eyes, looked the personification ofmischief; and a beautiful golden oriole, quietly cleaning its radiant-coloredtail on a perch, placed near a large window of the veranda. In India,\"spiritual\" seances are not held in the dark, as in America; and no conditions,but perfect silence and harmony, are required. It was in the full glare ofdaylight streaming through the opened doors and windows, with a far-away buzz oflife from the neighboring forests, and jungles sending us the echo of myriads ofinsects, birds, and animals. We sat in the midst of a garden in which the housewas built, and instead of breathing the stifling atmosphere of a seance-room, wewere amid the fire-colored clusters of the erythrina--the coral tree--inhalingthe fragrant aromas of trees and shrubs, and the flowers of the bignonia, whosewhite blossoms trembled in the soft breeze. In short, we were surrounded withlight, harmony, and perfumes. Large nosegays of flowers and shrubs, sacred tothe native gods, were gathered for the purpose, and brought into the rooms. Wehad the sweet basil, the Vishnu-flower, without which no religious ceremony inBengal will ever take place; and the branches of the Ficus religiosa, the treededicated to the same bright deity, intermingling their leaves with the rosyblossoms of the sacred lotos and the Indian tuberose, profusely ornamented thewalls. While the \"blessed one\"--represented by a very dirty, but, nevertheless, reallyholy fakir--remained plunged in self-contemplation, and some spiritual wonderswere taking place under the direction of his will, the monkey and the birdexhibited but few signs of restlessness. The tiger alone visibly trembled atintervals, and stared around the room, as if his phosphorically-shining greenorbs were following some invisible presence as it floated up and down. Thatwhich was as yet unperceived by human eyes, must have therefore been objectiveto him. As to the wanderoo, all its liveliness had fled; it seemed drowsy, andsat crouching and motionless. The bird gave few, if any, signs of uneasiness.There was a sound as of gently-flapping wings in the air; the flowers wenttravelling about the room, displaced by invisible hands; and, as a gloriousazure-tinted flower fell on the folded paws of the monkey, it gave a nervousstart, and sought refuge under its master's white robe. These displays lastedfor an hour, and it would be too long to relate all of them; the most curious ofall, being the one which closed that season of wonders. Somebody complaining ofthe heat, we had a shower of delicately-perfumed dew. The drops fell fast andlarge, and conveyed a feeling of inexpressible refreshment, drying the instantafter touching our persons. When the fakir had brought his exhibition of white magic to a close, the\"sorcerer,\" or conjurer, as they are called, prepared to display his power. Wewere treated to a succession of the wonders that the accounts of travellers havemade familiar to the public; showing, among other things, the fact that animalsnaturally possess the clairvoyant faculty, and even, it would seem, the abilityto discern between the good and the bad spirits. All of the sorcerer's featswere preceded by fumigations. He burned branches of resinous trees and shrubs,which sent up volumes of smoke. Although there was nothing about this calculatedto affright an animal using only his natural eyes, the tiger, monkey, and birdexhibited an indescribable terror. We suggested that the animals might befrightened at the blazing brands, the familiar custom of burning fires round thecamp to keep off wild beasts, recurring to our mind. To leave no doubt upon thispoint, the Syrian approached the crouching tiger with a branch of theBael-tree * (sacred to Siva), and waved it several times over his head,muttering, meanwhile, his incantations. The brute instantly displayed a panic ofterror beyond description. His eyes started from their sockets like blazingfire-balls; he foamed at the mouth; he flung himself upon the floor, as ifseeking some hole in which to hide himself; he uttered scream after scream, thatawoke a hundred responsive echoes from the jungle and the woods. Finally, takinga last look at the spot from which his eyes had never wandered, he made adesperate plunge, which snapped his chain, and dashed through the window of theveranda, carrying a piece of the frame-work with him. The monkey had fled longbefore, and the bird fell from the perch as though paralyzed. We did not ask either the fakir or sorcerer for an explanation of the method bywhich their respective phenomena were effected. If we had, unquestionably theywould have replied as did a fakir to a French traveller, who tells his story ina recent number of a New York newspaper, called the Franco-American, as follows: \"Many of these Hindu jugglers who live in the silence of the pagodas performfeats far surpassing the prestidigitations of Robert Houdin, and there are manyothers who produce the most curious phenomena in magnetism and catalepsy uponthe first objects that come across their way, that I have often wondered whetherthe Brahmans, with their occult sciences, have not made great discoveries in thequestions which have recently been agitated in Europe. \"On one occasion, while I and others were in a cafe with Sir Maswell, he orderedhis dobochy to introduce the charmer. In a few moments a lean Hindu, almostnaked, with an ascetic face and bronzed color entered. Around his neck, arms,thighs, and body were coiled serpents of different sizes. After saluting us, hesaid, 'God be with you, I am Chibh-Chondor, son of Chibh-Gontnalh-Mava.' \" 'We desire to see what you can do,' said our host. \" 'I obey the orders of Siva, who has sent me here,' replied the fakir,squatting down on one of the marble slabs. \"The serpents raised their heads and hissed, but without showing any anger. Thentaking a small pipe, attached to a wick in his hair, he produced scarcelyaudible sounds, imitating the tailapaca, a bird that feeds upon bruisedcocoanuts. Here the serpents uncoiled themselves, and one after another glidedto the floor. As soon as they touched the ground they raised about one-third oftheir bodies, and began to keep time to their master's music. Suddenly the fakirdropped his instrument and made several passes with his hands over the serpents,of whom there were about ten, all of the most deadly species of Indian cobra.His eye assumed a strange expression. We all felt an undefinable uneasiness, andsought to turn away our gaze from him. At this moment a small shocra * (monkey)whose business was to hand fire in a small brasier for lighting cigars, yieldedto his influence, lay down, and fell asleep. Five minutes passed thus, and wefelt that if the manipulations were to continue a few seconds more we should allfall asleep. Chondor then rose, and making two more passes over the shocra, saidto it: 'Give the commander some fire.' The young monkey rose, and withouttottering, came and offered fire to its master. It was pinched, pulled about,till there was no doubt of its being actually asleep. Nor would it move from SirMaswell's side till ordered to do so by the fakir. \"We then examined the cobras. Paralyzed by magnetic influence, they lay at fulllength on the ground. On taking them up we found them stiff as sticks. They werein a state of complete catalepsy. The fakir then awakened them, on which theyreturned and again coiled themselves round his body. We inquired whether hecould make us feel his influence. He made a few passes over our legs, andinstantly we lost the use of these limbs; we could not leave our seats. Hereleased us a easily as he had paralyzed us. \"Chibh-Chondor closed his seance by experimenting upon inanimate objects. Bymere passes with his hands in the direction of the object to be acted upon, andwithout leaving his seat, he paled and extinguished lights in the furthest partsof the room, moved the furniture, including the divans upon which we sat, openedand closed doors. Catching sight of a Hindu who was drawing water from a well inthe garden, he made a pass in his direction, and the rope suddenly stopped inits descent, resisting all the efforts of the astonished gardener. With anotherpass the rope again descended. \"I asked Chibh-Chondor: 'Do you employ the same means in acting upon inanimateobjects that you do upon living creatures?' \"He replied, 'I have only one means.' \" 'What is it?' \" 'The will. Man, who is the end of all intellectual and material forces, mustdominate over all. The Brahmans know nothing besides this.' \" \"Sanang Setzen,\" says Colonel Yule, * \"enumerates a variety of the wonderfulacts which could be performed through the Dharani (mystic Hindu charms). Suchwere sticking a peg into solid rock; restoring the dead to life; turning a deadbody into gold; penetrating everywhere as air does (in astral form); flying;catching wild beasts with the hand; reading thoughts; making water flowbackward; eating tiles; sitting in the air with the legs doubled under, etc.\"Old legends ascribe to Simon Magus precisely the same powers. \"He made statuesto walk; leaped into the fire without being burned; flew in the air; made breadof stones; changed his shape; assumed two faces at once; converted himself intoa pillar; caused closed doors to fly open spontaneously; made the vessels in ahouse move of themselves, etc.\" The Jesuit Delrio laments that credulousprinces, otherwise of pious repute, should have allowed diabolical tricks to beplayed before them, \"as for example, things of iron, and silver goblets, orother heavy articles, to be moved by bounds, from one end of the table to theother, without the use of a magnet, or of any attachment.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_659] We believe WILL-POWER themost powerful of magnets. The existence of such magical power in certain personsis proved, but the existence of the Devil is a fiction, which no theology isable to demonstrate. \"There are certain men whom the Tartars honor above all in the world,\" saysFriar Ricold, \"viz., the Baxitae, who are a kind of idol-priests. These are menfrom India, persons of deep wisdom, well-conducted and of the gravest morals.They are usually with magic arts . . . they exhibit many illusions, and predictfuture events. For instance, one of eminence among them was said to fly; but thetruth, however, was as it proved, that he did not fly, but did walk close to thesurface of the ground without touching it; and would seem to sit down withouthaving any substance to support him. ** This last performance was witnessed byIbn Batuta, at Delhi,\" adds Colonel Yule, who quotes the friar in the Book ofSer Marco Polo, \"in the presence of Sultan Mahomet Tughlak; and it wasprofessedly exhibited by a Brahman at Madras in the present century, adescendant doubtless of those Brahmans whom Apollonius saw walking two cubitsfrom the ground. It is also described by the worthy Francis Valentyn, as aperformance known and practiced in his own day in India. It is related, he says,that 'a man will first go and sit on three sticks put together so as to form atripod; after which, first one stick, then a second, then a third shall beremoved from under him, and the man shall not fall but shall still remainsitting in the air! Yet I have spoken with two friends who had seen this at oneand the same time; and one of them, I may add, mistrusting his own eyes, hadtaken the trouble to feel about with a long stick if there were nothing on whichthe body rested; yet, as the gentleman told me, he could neither feel nor seeany such thing.' \" We have stated elsewhere that the same thing was accomplishedlast year, before the Prince of Wales and his suite. Such feats as the above are nothing in comparison to what is done by professedjugglers; \"feats,\" remarks the above-quoted author, \"which might be regarded assimply inventions if told by one author only, but which seem to deserveprominent notice from being recounted by a series of authors, certainlyindependent of one another, and writing at long intervals of time and place. Ourfirst witness is Ibn Batuta, and it will be necessary to quote him as well asthe others in full, in order to show how closely their evidence tallies. TheArab traveller was present at a great entertainment at the court of the Viceroyof Khansa. 'That same night a juggler, who was one of the Khan's slaves, madehis appearance, and the Amir said to him, \"Come and show us some of yourmarvels.\" Upon this he took a wooden ball, with several holes in it, throughwhich long thongs were passed, and laying hold of one of these, slung it intothe air. It went so high that we lost sight of it altogether. . . . (We were inthe middle of the palace-court.) There now remained only a little of the end ofa thong in the conjurer's hand, and he desired one of the boys who assisted himto lay hold of it and mount. He did so, climbing by the thong, and we lost sightof him also! The conjurer then called to him three times, but, getting noanswer, he snatched up a knife as if in a great rage, laid hold of the thong,and disappeared also! By and bye, he threw down one of the boy's hands, then afoot, then the other hand, and then the other foot, then the trunk, and last ofall the head! Then he came down himself, puffing and panting, and with hisclothes all bloody kissed the ground before the Amir, and said something to himin Chinese. The Amir gave some order in reply, and our friend then took thelad's limbs, laid them together in their places, and gave a kick, when, presto!there was the boy, who got up and stood before us! All this astonished me beyondmeasure, and I had an attack of palpitation like that which overcame me oncebefore in the presence of the Sultan of India, when he showed me something ofthe same kind. They gave me a cordial, however, which cured the attack. The KajiAfkharuddin was next to me, and quoth he, \"Wallah! 't is my opinion there hasbeen neither going up nor coming down, neither marring, nor mending! 'T is allhocus-pocus!\" ' \" And who doubts but that it is a \"hocus-pocus,\" an illusion, or Maya, as theHindus express it? But when such an illusion can be forced on, say, ten thousandpeople at the same time, as we have seen it performed during a public festival,surely the means by which such an astounding hallucination can be producedmerits the attention of science! When by such magic a man who stands before you,in a room, the doors of which you have closed and of which the keys are in yourhand, suddenly disappears, vanishes like a flash of light, and you see himnowhere but hear his voice from different parts of the room addressing you andlaughing at your perplexity, surely such an art is not unworthy either of Mr.Huxley or Dr. Carpenter. Is it not quite as well worth spending time over, asthe lesser mystery--why barnyard cocks crow at midnight? What Ibn Batuta, the Moor, saw in China about the year 1348, Colonel Yule showsEdward Melton, \"an Anglo-Dutch traveller,\" witnessing in Batavia about the year1670: \"One of the same gang\" (of conjurers), says Melton, * \"took a small ballof cord, and grasping one end of the cord in his hand slung the other up intothe air with such force that its extremity was beyond reach of our sight. Hethen climbed up the cord with indescribable swiftness. . . . I stood full ofastonishment, not conceiving where he had disappeared; when lo! a leg cametumbling down out of the air. A moment later a hand came down, etc. . . . Inshort, all the members of the body came successively tumbling from the air andwere cast together by the attendant into the basket. The last fragment of allwas the head, and no sooner had that touched the ground than he who had snatchedup all the limbs and put them in the basket, turned them all out again topsyturvy. Then straightway we saw with these eyes all those limbs creep togetheragain, and, in short, form a whole man, who at once could stand and go just asbefore without showing the least damage! . . . Never in my life was I soastonished . . . and I doubted now no longer that these misguided men did it bythe help of the Devil.\" In the memoirs of the Emperor Jahangire, the performances of seven jugglers fromBengal, who exhibited before him, are thus described: \"Ninth. They produced aman whom they divided limb from limb, actually severing his head from the body.They scattered these mutilated members along the ground, and in this state theylay some time. They then extended a sheet over the spot, and one of the menputting himself under the sheet, in a few minutes came from below, followed bythe individual supposed to have been cut into joints, in perfect health andcondition. . . . Twenty-third. They produced a chain of fifty cubits in length,and in my presence threw one end of it toward the sky, where it remained as iffastened to something in the air. A dog was then brought forward and beingplaced at the lower end of the chain, immediately ran up, and reaching the otherend, immediately disappeared in the air. In the same manner a hog, a panther, alion, and a tiger were successively sent up the chain, and all equallydisappeared at the upper end of the chain. At last they took down the chain, andput it into the bag, no one ever discovering in what way the different animalswere made to vanish into the air in the mysterious manner above described.\" ** We have in our possession a picture painted from such a Persian conjurer, with aman, or rather the various limbs of what was a minute before a man, scatteredbefore him. We have seen such conjurers, and witnessed such performances morethan once and in various places. Bearing ever in mind that we repudiate the idea of a miracle and returning oncemore to phenomena more serious, we would now ask what logical objection can beurged against the claim that the reanimation of the dead was accomplished bymany thaumaturgists? The fakir described in the Franco-Americain, might havegone far enough to say that this will-power of man is so tremendously potentialthat it can reanimate a body apparently dead, by drawing back the flitting soulthat has not yet quite ruptured the thread that through life had bound the twotogether. Dozens of such fakirs have allowed themselves to be buried alivebefore thousands of witnesses, and weeks afterward have been resuscitated. Andif fakirs have the secret of this artificial process, identical with, oranalogous to, hibernation, why not allow that their ancestors, theGymnosophists, and Apollonius of Tyana, who had studied with the latter inIndia, and Jesus, and other prophets and seers, who all knew more about themysteries of life and death than any of our modern men of science, might haveresuscitated dead men and women? And being quite familiar with that power--thatmysterious something \"that science cannot yet understand,\" as Professor Le Conteconfesses--knowing, moreover, \"whence it came and whither it was going,\" Elisha,Jesus, Paul, and Apollonius, enthusiastic ascetics and learned initiates, mighthave recalled to life with ease any man who \"was not dead but sleeping,\" andthat without any miracle. If the molecules of the cadaver are imbued with the physical and chemical forcesof the living organism, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_663]what is to prevent them from being set again in motion, provided we know thenature of the vital force, and how to command it? The materialist can certainlyoffer no objection, for with him it is no question of reinfusing a soul. For himthe soul has no existence, and the human body may be regarded simply as a vitalengine--a locomotive which will start upon the application of heat and force,and stop when they are withdrawn. To the theologian the case offers greaterdifficulties, for, in his view, death cuts asunder the tie which binds soul andbody, and the one can no more be returned into the other without miracle thanthe born infant can be compelled to resume its foetal life after parturition andthe severing of the umbilicus. But the Hermetic philosopher stands between thesetwo irreconcilable antagonists, \"master of the situation. He knows the nature ofthe soul--a form composed of nervous fluid and atmospheric ether--and knows howthe vital force can be made active or passive at will, so long as there is nofinal destruction of some necessary organ. The claims of Gaffarilus--which, bythe bye, appeared so preposterous in 1650 **-were later corroborated by science. He maintained that every object existing in nature, provided it was notartificial, when once burned still retained its form in the ashes, in which itremained till raised again. Du Chesne, an eminent chemist, assured himself ofthe fact. Kircher, Digby, and Vallemont have demonstrated that the forms ofplants could be resuscitated from their ashes. At a meeting of naturalists in1834, at Stuttgart, a receipt for producing such experiments was found in a workof Oetinger. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_665] Ashes ofburned plants contained in vials, when heated, exhibited again their variousforms. \"A small obscure cloud gradually rose in the vial, took a defined form,and presented to the eye the flower or plant the ashes consisted of.\" \"Theearthly husk,\" wrote Oetinger, \"remains in the retort, while the volatileessence ascends, like a spirit, perfect in form, but void of substance.\" ** And, if the astral form of even a plant when its body is dead still lingers inthe ashes, will skeptics persist in saying that the soul of man, the inner ego,is after the death of the grosser form at once dissolved, and is no more? \"Atdeath,\" says the philosopher, \"the one body exudes from the other, by osmose andthrough the brain; it is held near its old garment by a double attraction,physical and spiritual, until the latter decomposes; and if the properconditions are given the soul can reinhabit it and resume the suspended life. Itdoes it in sleep; it does it more thoroughly in trance; most surprisingly at thecommand and with the assistance of the Hermetic adept. Iamblichus declared thata person endowed with such resuscitating powers is 'full of God.' All thesubordinate spirits of the upper spheres are at his command, for he is no longera mortal, but himself a god. In his Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul remarksthat 'the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.' \" Some persons have the natural and some the acquired power of withdrawing theinner from the outer body, at will, and causing it to perform long journeys, andbe seen by those whom it visits. Numerous are the instances recorded byunimpeachable witnesses of the \"doubles\" of persons having been seen andconversed with, hundreds of miles from the places where the persons themselveswere known to be. Hermotimus, if we may credit Pliny and Plutarch, ***[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_667] could at will fall into atrance and then his second soul proceeded to any distant place he chose. The Abbe Tritheim, the famous author of Steganographie, who lived in theseventeenth century, could converse with his friends by the mere power of hiswill. \"I can make my thoughts known to the initiated,\"he wrote, \"at a distanceof many hundred miles, without word, writing, or cipher, by any messenger. Thelatter cannot betray me, for he knows nothing. If needs be, I can dispense withthe messenger. If any correspondent should be buried in the deepest dungeon, Icould still convey to him my thoughts as clearly and as frequently as I chose,and this quite simply, without superstition, without the aid of spirits.\"Cordanus could also send his spirit, or any messages he chose. When he did so,he felt \"as if a door was opened, and I myself immediately passed through it,leaving the body behind me.\" * The case of a high German official, a counsellorWesermann, was mentioned in a scientific paper. ** He claimed to be able tocause any friend or acquaintance, at any distance, to dream of every subject hechose, or see any person he liked. His claims were proved good, and testified toon several occasions by skeptics and learned professional persons. He could alsocause his double to appear wherever he liked; and be seen by several persons atone time. By whispering in their ears a sentence prepared and agreed uponbeforehand by unbelievers, and for the purpose, his power to project the doublewas demonstrated beyond any cavil. According to Napier, Osborne, Major Lawes, Quenouillet, Nikiforovitch, and manyother modern witnesses, fakirs are now proved to be able, by a long course ofdiet, preparation, and repose, to bring their bodies into a condition whichenables them to be buried six feet under ground for an indefinite period. SirClaude Wade was present at the court of Rundjit Singh, when the fakir, mentionedby the Honorable Captain Osborne, was buried alive for six weeks, in a boxplaced in a cell three feet below the floor of the room. *** To prevent thechance of deception, a guard comprising two companies of soldiers had beendetailed, and four sentries \"were furnished and relieved every two hours, nightand day, to guard the building from intrusion. . . . On opening it,\" says SirClaude, \"we saw a figure enclosed in a bag of white linen fastened by a stringover the head . . . the servant then began pouring warm water over the figure .. . the legs and arms of the body were shrivelled and stiff, the face full, thehead reclining on the shoulder like that of a corpse. I then called to themedical gentleman who was attending me, to come down and inspect the body, whichhe did, but could discover no pulsation in the heart, the temples, or the arm.There was, however, a heat about the region of the brain, which no other part ofthe body exhibited.\" Regretting that the limits of our space forbid the quotation of the details ofthis interesting story, we will only add, that the process of resuscitationincluded bathing with hot water, friction, the removal of wax and cottonpledgets from the nostrils and ears, the rubbing of the eyelids with ghee orclarified butter, and, what will appear most curious to many, the application ofa hot wheaten cake, about an inch thick \"to the top of the head.\" After the cakehad been applied for the third time, the body was violently convulsed, thenostrils became inflated, the respiration ensued, and the limbs assumed anatural fulness; but the pulsation was still faintly perceptible. \"The tonguewas then anointed with ghee; the eyeballs became dilated and recovered theirnatural color, and the fakir recognized those present and spoke.\" It should benoticed that not only had the nostrils and ears been plugged, but the tongue hadbeen thrust back so as to close the gullet, thus effectually stopping theorifices against the admission of atmospheric air. While in India, a fakir toldus that this was done not only to prevent the action of the air upon the organictissues, but also to guard against the deposit of the germs of decay, which incase of suspended animation would cause decomposition exactly as they do in anyother meat exposed to air. There are also localities in which a fakir wouldrefuse to be buried; such as the many spots in Southern India infested with thewhite ants, which annoying termites are considered among the most dangerousenemies of man and his property. They are so voracious as to devour everythingthey find except perhaps metals. As to wood, there is no kind through which theywould not burrow; and even bricks and mortar offer but little impediment totheir formidable armies. They will patiently work through mortar, destroying itparticle by particle; and a fakir, however holy himself, and strong histemporary coffin, would not risk finding his body devoured when it was time forhis resuscitation. Then, here is a case, only one of many, substantiated by the testimony of twoEnglish noblemen--one of them an army officer--and a Hindu Prince, who was asgreat a skeptic as themselves. It places science in this embarrassing dilemma:it must either give the lie to many unimpeachable witnesses, or admit that ifone fakir can resuscitate after six weeks, any other fakir can also; and if afakir, why not a Lazarus, a Shunamite boy, or the daughter of Jairus? * And now, perhaps, it may not be out of place to inquire what assurance can anyphysician have, beyond external evidence, that the body is really dead? The bestauthorities agree in saying that there are none. Dr. Todd Thomson, of London, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_672] says most positively that\"the immobility of the body, even its cadaverous aspect, the coldness ofsurface, the absence of respiration and pulsation, and the sunken state of theeye, are no unequivocal evidences that life is wholly extinct.\" Nothing buttotal decomposition is an irrefutable proof that life has fled for ever and thatthe tabernacle is tenantless. Demokritus asserted that there existed no certainsigns of real death. ** Pliny maintained the same. *** Asclepiades, a learnedphysician and one of the most distinguished men of his day, held that theassurance was still more difficult in the cases of women than in those of men. Todd Thomson, above quoted, gives several remarkable cases of such a suspendedanimation. Among others he mentions a certain Francis Neville, a Normangentleman, who twice apparently died, and was twice in the act of being buried.But, at the moment when the coffin was being lowered in the grave, hespontaneously revived. In the seventeenth century, Lady Russell, to allappearance died, and was about to be buried, but as the bell was tolling for herfuneral, she sat up in her coffin and exclaimed, \"It is time to go to church!\"Diemerbroeck mentions a peasant who gave no signs of life for three days, butwhen placed in his coffin, near the grave, revived and lived many yearsafterward. In 1836, a respectable citizen of Brussels fell into a profoundlethargy on a Sunday morning. On Monday, as his attendants were preparing toscrew the lid of the coffin, the supposed corpse sat up, rubbed his eyes, andcalled for his coffee and a newspaper. **** Such cases of apparent death are not very infrequently reported in the newspaperpress. As we write (April, 1877), we find in a London letter to the New YorkTimes, the following paragraph: \"Miss Annie Goodale, the actress, died threeweeks ago. Up to yesterday she was not buried. The corpse is warm and limp, andthe features as soft and mobile as when in life. Several physicians haveexamined her, and have ordered that the body shall be watched night and day. Thepoor lady is evidently in a trance, but whether she is destined to come to lifeit is impossible to say.\" Science regards man as an aggregation of atoms temporarily united by amysterious force called the life-principle. To the materialist, the onlydifference between a living and a dead body is, that in the one case, that forceis active, in the other latent. When it is extinct or entirely latent themolecules obey a superior attraction, which draws them asunder and scatters themthrough space. This dispersion must be death, if it is possible to conceive such a thing asdeath, where the very molecules of the dead body manifest an intense vitalenergy. If death is but the stoppage of a digesting, locomotive, andthought-grinding machine, how can death be actual and not relative, before thatmachine is thoroughly broken up and its particles dispersed? So long as any ofthem cling together, the centripetal vital force may overmatch the dispersivecentrifugal action. Says Eliphas Levi: \"Change attests movement, and movementonly reveals life. The corpse would not decompose if it were dead; all themolecules which compose it are living and struggle to separate. And would youthink that the spirit frees itself first of all to exist no more? That thoughtand love can die when the grossest forms of matter do not die? If the changeshould be called death, we die and are born again every day, for every day ourforms undergo change.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_676] The kabalists say that a man is not dead when his body is entombed. Death isnever sudden; for, according to Hermes, nothing goes in nature by violenttransitions. Everything is gradual, and as it required a long and gradualdevelopment to produce the living human being, so time is required to completelywithdraw vitality from the carcass. \"Death can no more be an absolute end, thanbirth a real beginning. Birth proves the preexistence of the being, as deathproves immortality,\" says the same French kabalist. While implicitly believing in the restoration of the daughter of Jairus, theruler of the synagogue, and in other Bible-miracles, well-educated Christians,who otherwise would feel indignant at being called superstitious, meet all suchcases as that of Apollonius and the girl said by his biographer to have beenrecalled to life by him, with scornful skepticism. Diogenes Laertius, whomentions a woman restored to life by Empedocles, is treated with no morerespect; and the name of Pagan thaumaturgist, in the eyes of Christians, is buta synonym for impostor. Our scientists are at least one degree more rational;they embrace all Bible prophets and apostles, and the heathen miracle-doers intwo categories of hallucinated fools and deceitful tricksters. But Christians and materialists might, with a very little effort on their part,show themselves fair and logical at the same time. To produce such a miracle,they have but to consent to understand what they read, and submit it to theunprejudiced criticism of their best judgment. Let us see how far it ispossible. Setting aside the incredible fiction of Lazarus, we will select twocases: the ruler's daughter, recalled to life by Jesus, and the Corinthianbride, resuscitated by Apollonius. In the former case, totally disregarding thesignificant expression of Jesus--\"She is not dead but sleepeth,\" the clergyforce their god to become a breaker of his own laws and grant unjustly to onewhat he denies to all others, and with no better object in view than to producea useless miracle. In the second case, notwithstanding the words of thebiographer of Apollonius, so plain and precise that there is not the slightestcause to misunderstand them, they charge Philostratus with deliberate imposture.Who could be fairer than he, who less open to the charge of mystification, when,in describing the resuscitation of the young girl by the Tyanian sage, in thepresence of a large concourse of people, the biographer says, \"she had seemed todie.\" In other words, he very clearly indicates a case of suspended animation; andthen adds immediately, \"as the rain fell very fast on the young girl,\" while shewas being carried to the pile, \"with her face turned upwards, this, also, mighthave excited her senses.\" * Does this not show most plainly that Philostratussaw no miracle in that resuscitation? Does it not rather imply, if anything, thegreat learning and skill of Apollonius, \"who like Asclepiades had the merit ofdistinguishing at a glance between real and apparent death\"? ** A resuscitation, after the soul and spirit have entirely separated from thebody, and the last electric thread is severed, is as impossible as for a oncedisembodied spirit to reincarnate itself once more on this earth, except asdescribed in previous chapters. \"A leaf, once fallen off, does not reattachitself to the branch,\" says Eliphas Levi. \"The caterpillar becomes a butterfly,but the butterfly does not again return to the grub. Nature closes the doorbehind all that passes, and pushes life forward. Forms pass, thought remains,and does not recall that which it has once exhausted.\" *** Why should it be imagined that Asclepiades and Apollonius enjoyed exceptionalpowers for the discernment of actual death? Has any modern school of medicinethis knowledge to impart to its students? Let their authorities answer for them.These prodigies of Jesus and Apollonius are so well attested that they appearauthentic. Whether in either or both cases life was simply suspended or not, theimportant fact remains that by some power, peculiar to themselves, both thewonder-workers recalled the seemingly dead to life in an instant. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_680] Is it because the modern physician has not yet found the secret which thetheurgists evidently possessed that its possibility is denied? Neglected as psychology now is, and with the strangely chaotic state in whichphysiology is confessed to be by its most fair students, certainly it is notvery likely that our men of science will soon rediscover the lost knowledge ofthe ancients. In the days of old, when prophets were not treated as charlatans,nor thaumaturgists as impostors, there were colleges instituted for teachingprophecy and occult sciences in general. Samuel is recorded as the chief of suchan institution at Ramah; Elisha, also, at Jericho. The schools of hazim,prophets or seers, were celebrated throughout the country. Hillel had a regularacademy, and Socrates is well known to have sent away several of his disciplesto study manticism. The study of magic, or wisdom, included every branch ofscience, the metaphysical as well as the physical, psychology and physiology intheir common and occult phases, and the study of alchemy was universal, for itwas both a physical and a spiritual science. Therefore why doubt or wonder thatthe ancients, who studied nature under its double aspect, achieved discoverieswhich to our modern physicists, who study but its dead letter, are a closedbook? Thus, the question at issue is not whether a dead body can be resuscitated--for,to assert that would be to assume the possibility of a miracle, which isabsurd--but, to assure ourselves whether the medical authorities pretend todetermine the precise moment of death. The kabalists say that death occurs atthe instant when both the astral body, or life-principle, and the spirit partforever with the corporeal body. The scientific physician who denies both astralbody and spirit, and admits the existence of nothing more than thelife-principle, judges death to occur when life is apparently extinct. When thebeating of the heart and the action of the lungs cease, and rigor mortis ismanifested, and especially when decomposition begins, they pronounce the patientdead. But the annals of medicine teem with examples of \"suspended animation\" asthe result of asphyxia by drowning, the inhalation of gases and other causes;life being restored in the case of drowning persons even after they had beenapparently dead for twelve hours. In cases of somnambulic trance, none of the ordinary signs of death are lacking;breathing and the pulse are extinct; animal-heat has disappeared; the musclesare rigid, the eye glazed, and the body is colorless. In the celebrated case ofColonel Townshend, he threw himself into this state in the presence of threemedical men; who, after a time, were persuaded that he was really dead, and wereabout leaving the room, when he slowly revived. He describes his peculiar giftby saying that he \"could die or expire when he pleased, and yet, by an effort,or somehow he could come to life again.\" There occurred in Moscow, a few years since, a remarkable instance of apparentdeath. The wife of a wealthy merchant lay in the cataleptic state seventeendays, during which the authorities made several attempts to bury her; but, asdecomposition had not set in, the family averted the ceremony, and at the end ofthat time she was restored to life. The above instances show that the most learned men in the medical profession areunable to be certain when a person is dead. What they call \"suspendedanimation,\" is that state from which the patient spontaneously recovers, throughan effort of his own spirit, which may be provoked by any one of many causes. Inthese cases, the astral body has not parted from the physical body; its externalfunctions are simply suspended; the subject is in a state of torpor, and therestoration is nothing but a recovery from it. But, in the case of what physiologists would call \"real death,\" but which is notactually so, the astral body has withdrawn; perhaps local decomposition has setin. How shall the man be brought to life again? The answer is, the interior bodymust be forced back into the exterior one, and vitality reawakened in thelatter. The clock has run down, it must be wound. If death is absolute; if theorgans have not only ceased to act, but have lost the susceptibility of renewedaction, then the whole universe would have to be thrown into chaos toresuscitate the corpse--a miracle would be demanded. But, as we said before, theman is not dead when he is cold, stiff, pulseless, breathless, and even showingsigns of decomposition; he is not dead when buried, nor afterward, until acertain point is reached. That point is, when the vital organs have become sodecomposed, that if reanimated, they could not perform their customaryfunctions; when the mainspring and cogs of the machine, so to speak, are soeaten away by rust, that they would snap upon the turning of the key. Until thatpoint is reached, the astral body may be caused, without miracle, to reenter itsformer tabernacle, either by an effort of its own will, or under the resistlessimpulse of the will of one who knows the potencies of nature and how to directthem. The spark is not extinguished, but only latent--latent as the fire in theflint, or the heat in the cold iron. In cases of the most profound cataleptic clairvoyance, such as obtained by DuPotet, and described very graphically by the late Prof. William Gregory, in hisLetters on Animal Magnetism, the spirit is so far disengaged from the body thatit would be impossible for it to reenter it without an effort of themesmerizer's will. The subject is practically dead, and, if left to itself, thespirit would escape forever. Although independent of the torpid physical casing,the half-freed spirit is still tied to it by a magnetic cord, which is describedby clairvoyants as appearing dark and smoky by contrast with the ineffablebrightness of the astral atmosphere through which they look. Plutarch, relatingthe story of Thespesius, who fell from a great height, and lay three daysapparently dead, gives us the experience of the latter during his state ofpartial decease. \"Thespesius,\" says he, \"then observed that he was differentfrom the dead by whom he was surrounded. . . . They were transparent andenvironed by a radiance, but he seemed to trail after him a dark radiation orline of shadow.\" His whole description, minute and circumstantial in itsdetails, appears to be corroborated by the clairvoyants of every period, and, sofar as this class of testimony can be taken, is important. The kabalists, as wefind them interpreted by Eliphas Levi, in his Science des Esprits, say that,\"When a man falls into the last sleep, he is plunged at first into a sort ofdream, before gaining consciousness in the other side of life. He sees, then,either in a beautiful vision, or in a terrible nightmare, the paradise or hell,in which he believed during his mortal existence. This is why it often happens,that the affrighted soul breaks violently back into the terrestrial life it hasjust left, and why some who were really dead, i.e., who, if left alone andquiet, would have peaceably passed away forever in a state of unconsciouslethargy, when entombed too soon, reawake to life in the grave.\" In this connection, the reader may perhaps recall the well-known case of the oldman who had left some generous gifts in his will to his orphaned nieces; whichdocument, just before his death, he had confided to his rich son, withinjunctions to carry out his wishes. But, he had not been dead more than a fewhours before the son, finding himself alone with the corpse, tore the will andburned it. The sight of this impious deed apparently recalled the hoveringspirit, and the old man, rising from his couch of death, uttered a fiercemalediction upon the horror-stricken wretch, and then fell back again, andyielded up his spirit--this time forever. Dion Boucicault makes use of anincident of this kind in his powerful drama Louis XI.; and Charles Kean createda profound impression in the character of the French monarch, when the dead manrevives for an instant and clutches the crown as the heir-apparent approachesit. Levi says that resuscitation is not impossible while the vital organism remainsundestroyed, and the astral spirit is yet within reach. \"Nature,\" he says,\"accomplishes nothing by sudden jerks, and eternal death is always preceded by astate which partakes somewhat of the nature of lethargy. It is a torpor which agreat shock or the magnetism of a powerful will can overcome.\" He accounts inthis manner for the resuscitation of the dead man thrown upon the bones ofElisha. He explains it by saying that the soul was hovering at that moment nearthe body; the burial party, according to tradition, were attacked by robbers;and their fright communicating itself sympathetically to it, the soul was seizedwith horror at the idea of its remains being desecrated, and \"reenteredviolently into its body to raise and save it.\" Those who believe in the survivalof the soul can see in this incident nothing of a supernatural character--it isonly a perfect manifestation of natural law. To narrate to the materialist sucha case, however well attested, would be but an idle talk; the theologian, alwayslooking beyond nature for a special providence, regards it as a prodigy. EliphasLevi says: \"They attributed the resuscitation to the contact with the bones ofElisha; and worship of relics dates logically from his epoch.\" Balfour Stewart is right--scientists \"know nothing, or next to nothing, of theultimate structure and properties of matter, whether organic or inorganic.\" We are now on such firm ground, that we will take another step in advance. Thesame knowledge and control of the occult forces, including the vital force whichenabled the fakir temporarily to leave and then reenter his body, and Jesus,Apollonius, and Elisha to recall their several subjects to life, made itpossible for the ancient hierophants to animate statues, and cause them to actand speak like living creatures. It is the same knowledge and power which madeit possible for Paracelsus to create his homunculi; for Aaron to change his rodinto a serpent and a budding branch; Moses to cover Egypt with frogs and otherpests; and the Egyptian theurgist of our day to vivify his pigmy Mandragora,which has physical life but no soul. It was no more wonderful that uponpresenting the necessary conditions Moses should call into life large reptilesand insects, than that, under like favoring conditions, the physical scientistshould call into life the small ones which he names bacteria. And now, in connection with ancient miracle-doers and prophets, let us bringforward the claims of the modern mediums. Nearly every form of phenomenarecorded in the sacred and profane histories of the world we find them claimingto reproduce in our days. Selecting, among the variety of seeming wonders,levitation of ponderable inanimate objects as well as of human bodies, we willgive our attention to the conditions under which the phenomenon is manifested.History records the names of Pagan theurgists, Christian saints, Hindu fakirs,and spiritual mediums who have been thus levitated, and who remained suspendedin the air, sometimes for a considerable time. The phenomenon has not beenconfined to one country or epoch, but almost invariably the subjects have beenreligious ecstatics, adepts in magic, or, as now, spiritual mediums. We assume the fact to be so well established as to require no labored effort onour part at this time to furnish proof that unconscious manifestations ofspirit-power, as well as conscious feats of high magic, have happened in allcountries, in all ages, and with hierophants as well as through irresponsiblemediums. When the present perfected European civilization was yet in an inchoatestate, occult philosophy, already hoary with age, speculated upon the attributesof man by analogy with those of his Creator. Individuals later, whose names willremain forever immortal, inscribed on the portal of the spiritual history ofman, have afforded in their persons examples of how far could be developed thegod-like powers of the microcosmos. Describing the Doctrines and PrincipalTeachers of the Alexandrian School, Professor A. Wilder says: \"Plotinus taughtthat there was in the soul a returning impulse, love, which attracted it inwardtoward its origin and centre, the eternal good. While the person who does notunderstand how the soul contains the beautiful within itself will seek bylaborious effort to realize beauty without, the wise man recognizes it withinhimself, develops the idea by withdrawal into himself, concentrating hisattention, and so floating upward toward the divine fountain, the stream ofwhich flows within him. The infinite is not known through the reason . . . butby a faculty superior to reason, by entering upon a state in which theindividual, so to speak, ceases to be his finite self, in which state divineessence is communicated to him. This is ECSTASY.\" Of Apollonius, who asserted that he could see \"the present and the future in aclear mirror,\" on account of his abstemious mode of life, the professor verybeautifully observes: \"This is what may be termed spiritual photography. Thesoul is the camera in which facts and events, future, past, and present, arealike fixed; and the mind becomes conscious of them. Beyond our every-day worldof limits, all is as one day or state, the past and future comprised in thepresent.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_681] Were these God-like men \"mediums,\" as the orthodox spiritualists will have it?By no means, if by the term we understand those \"sick-sensitives\" who are bornwith a peculiar organization, and who in proportion as their powers aredeveloped become more and more subject to the irresistible influence ofmiscellaneous spirits, purely human, elementary, or elemental. Unquestionablyso, if we consider every individual a medium in whose magnetic atmosphere thedenizens of higher invisible spheres can move, and act, and live. In such asense every person is a medium. Mediumship may be either 1st, self-developed;2d, by extraneous influences; or 3d, may remain latent throughout life. Thereader must bear in mind the definition of the term, for, unless this is clearlyunderstood, confusion will be inevitable. Mediumship of this kind may be eitheractive or passive, repellent or receptive, positive or negative. Mediumship ismeasured by the quality of the aura with which the individual is surrounded.This may be dense, cloudy, noisome, mephitic, nauseating to the pure spirit, andattract only those foul beings who delight in it, as the eel does in turbidwaters, or, it may be pure, crystalline, limpid, opalescent as the morning dew.All depends upon the moral character of the medium. About such men as Apollonius, Iamblichus, Plotinus, and Porphyry, there gatheredthis heavenly nimbus. It was evolved by the power of their own souls in closeunison with their spirits; by the superhuman morality and sanctity of theirlives, and aided by frequent interior ecstatic contemplation. Such holy men purespiritual influences could approach. Radiating around an atmosphere of divinebeneficence, they caused evil spirits to flee before them. Not only is it notpossible for such to exist in their aura, but they cannot even remain in that ofobsessed persons, if the thaumaturgist exercises his will, or even approachesthem. This is MEDIATORSHIP, not mediumship. Such persons are temples in whichdwells the spirit of the living God; but if the temple is defiled by theadmission of an evil passion, thought or desire, the mediator falls into thesphere of sorcery. The door is opened; the pure spirits retire and the evil onesrush in. This is still mediatorship, evil as it is; the sorcerer, like the puremagician, forms his own aura and subjects to his will congenial inferiorspirits. But mediumship, as now understood and manifested, is a different thing.Circumstances, independent of his own volition, may, either at birth orsubsequently, modify a person's aura, so that strange manifestations, physicalor mental, diabolical or angelic, may take place. Such mediumship, as well asthe above-mentioned mediatorship, has existed on earth since the firstappearance here of living man. The former is the yielding of weak, mortal fleshto the control and suggestions of spirits and intelligences other than one's ownimmortal demon. It is literally obsession and possession; and mediums who pridethemselves on being the faithful slaves of their \"guides,\" and who repudiatewith indignation the idea of \"controlling\" the manifestations, \"could not verywell deny the fact without inconsistency. This mediumship is typified in thestory of Eve succumbing to the reasonings of the serpent; of Pandora peeping inthe forbidden casket and letting loose on the world, sorrow and evil, and byMary Magdalene, who from having been obsessed by 'seven devils' was finallyredeemed by the triumphant struggle of her immortal spirit, touched by thepresence of a holy mediator, against the dweller.\" This mediumship, whetherbeneficent or maleficent, is always passive. Happy are the pure in heart, whorepel unconsciously, by that very cleanness of their inner nature, the darkspirits of evil. For verily they have no other weapons of defense but thatinborn goodness and purity. Mediumism, as practiced in our days, is a moreundesirable gift than the robe of Nessus. \"The tree is known by its fruits.\" Side by side with passive mediums in theprogress of the world's history, appear active mediators. We designate them bythis name for lack of a better one. The ancient witches and wizards, and thosewho had a \"familiar spirit,\" generally made of their gifts a trade; and theObeah woman of En-Dor, so well defined by Henry More, though she may have killedher calf for Saul, accepted hire from other visitors. In India, the jugglers,who by the way are less so than many a modern medium, and the Essaoua orsorcerers and serpent-charmers of Asia and Africa, all exercise their gifts formoney. Not so with the mediators, or hierophants. Buddha was a mendicant andrefused his father's throne. The \"Son of Man had not where to lay his head\"; thechosen apostles provided \"neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in their purses.\"Apollonius gave one half of his fortune to his relatives, the other half to thepoor; Iamblichus and Plotinus were renowned for charity and self-denial; thefakirs, or holy mendicants, of India are fairly described by Jacolliot; thePythagorean Essenes and Therapeutae believed their hands defiled by the contactof money. When the apostles were offered money to impart their spiritual powers,Peter, notwithstanding that the Bible shows him a coward and thrice a renegade,still indignantly spurned the offer, saying: \"Thy money perish with thee,because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.\"These men were mediators, guided merely by their own personal spirit, or divinesoul, and availing themselves of the help of spirits but so far as these remainin the right path. Far from us be the thought of casting an unjust slur on physical mediums.Harassed by various intelligences, reduced by the overpowering influence--whichtheir weak and nervous natures are unable to shake off--to a morbid state, whichat last becomes chronic, they are impeded by these \"influences\" from undertakingother occupation. They become mentally and physically unfit for any other. Whocan judge them harshly when, driven to the last extremity, they are constrainedto accept mediumship as a business? And heaven knows, as recent events have toowell proved, whether the calling is one to be envied by any one! It is notmediums, real, true, and genuine mediums that we would ever blame, but theirpatrons, the spiritualists. Plotinus, when asked to attend public worship of the gods, is said to haveproudly answered: \"It is for them (the spirits) to come to me.\" Iamblichusasserted and proved in his own case, that our soul can attain communion with thehighest intelligences, with \"natures loftier than itself,\" and carefully droveaway from his theurgical ceremonies * every inferior spirit, or bad daemon,which he taught his disciples to recognize. Proclus, who \"elaborated the entiretheosophy and theurgy of his predecessors into a complete system,\" ** accordingto Professor Wilder, \"believed with Iamblichus in the attaining of a divinepower, which, overcoming the mundane life, rendered the individual an organ ofthe Deity.\" He even taught that there was a \"mystic password that would carry aperson from one order of spiritual beings to another, higher and higher, till hearrived at the absolute divine.\" Apollonius spurned the sorcerers and \"commonsoothsayers,\" and declared that it was his \"peculiar abstemious mode of life\"which \"produced such an acuteness of the senses and created other faculties, sothat the greatest and most remarkable things can take place.\" Jesus declared manthe lord of the Sabbath, and at his command the terrestrial and elementaryspirits fled from their temporary abodes; a power which was shared by Apolloniusand many of the Brotherhood of the Essenes of Judea and Mount Carmel. It is undeniable that there must have been some good reasons why the ancientspersecuted unregulated mediums. Otherwise why, at the time of Moses and Davidand Samuel, should they have encouraged prophecy and divination, astrology andsoothsaying, and maintained schools and colleges in which these natural giftswere strengthened and developed, while witches and those who divined by thespirit of Ob were put to death? Even at the time of Christ, the poor oppressedmediums were driven to the tombs and waste places without the city walls. Whythis apparent gross injustice? Why should banishment, persecution, and death bethe portion of the physical mediums of those days, and whole communities ofthaumaturgists--like the Essenes--be not merely tolerated but revered? It isbecause the ancients, unlike ourselves, could \"try\" the spirits and discern thedifference between the good and the evil ones, the human and the elemental. Theyalso knew that unregulated spirit intercourse brought ruin upon the individualand disaster to the community. This view of mediumship may be novel and perhaps repugnant to many modernspiritualists; but still it is the view taught in the ancient philosophy, andsupported by the experience of mankind from time immemorial. It is erroneous to speak of a medium having powers developed. A passive mediumhas no power. He has a certain moral and physical condition which inducesemanations, or an aura, in which his controlling intelligences can live, and bywhich they manifest themselves. He is only the vehicle through which theydisplay their power. This aura varies day by day, and, as would appear from Mr.Crookes' experiments, even hour by hour. It is an external effect resulting frominterior causes. The medium's moral state determines the kind of spirits thatcome; and the spirits that come reciprocally influence the medium,intellectually, physically, and morally. The perfection of his mediumship is inratio to his passivity, and the danger he incurs is in equal degree. When he isfully \"developed\"--perfectly passive--his own astral spirit may be benumbed, andeven crowded out of his body, which is then occupied by an elemental, or, whatis worse, by a human fiend of the eighth sphere, who proceeds to use it as hisown. But too often the cause of the most celebrated crime is to be sought insuch possessions. Physical mediumship depending upon passivity, its antidote suggests itselfnaturally; let the medium cease being passive. Spirits never control persons ofpositive character who are determined to resist all extraneous influences. Theweak and feeble-minded whom they can make their victims they drive into vice. Ifthese miracle-making elementals and disembodied devils called elementary wereindeed the guardian angels that they have passed for, these last thirty years,why have they not given their faithful mediums at least good health and domestichappiness? Why do they desert them at the most critical moments of trial whenunder accusations of fraud? It is notorious that the best physical mediums areeither sickly or, sometimes, what is still worse, inclined to some abnormal viceor other. Why do not these healing \"guides,\" who make their mediums play thetherapeutists and thaumaturgists to others, give them the boon of robustphysical vigor? The ancient thaumaturgist and apostle, generally, if notinvariably, enjoyed good health; their magnetism never conveyed to the sickpatient any physical or moral taint; and they never were accused of VAMPIRISM,which a spiritual paper very justly charges upon some medium-healers. * If we apply the above law of mediumship and mediatorship to the subject oflevitation, with which we opened our present discussion, what shall we find?Here we have a medium and one of the mediator-class levitated--the former at aseance, the latter at prayer, or in ecstatic contemplation. The medium beingpassive must be lifted up; the ecstatic being active must levitate himself. Theformer is elevated by his familiar spirits--whoever or whatever they may be--thelatter, by the power of his own aspiring soul. Can both be indiscriminatelytermed mediums? But nevertheless we may be answered that the same phenomena are produced in thepresence of a modern medium as of an ancient saint. Undoubtedly; and so it wasin the days of Moses; for we believe that the triumph claimed for him in Exodusover Pharaoh's magicians is simply a national boast on the part of the \"chosenpeople.\" That the power which produced his phenomena produced that of themagicians also, who were moreover the first tutors of Moses and instructed himin their \"wisdom,\" is most probable. But even in those days they seemed to havewell appreciated the difference between phenomena apparently identical. Thetutelar national deity of the Hebrews (who is not the Highest Father) ** forbidsexpressly, in Deuteronomy, *** his people \"to learn to do after the abominationsof other nations. . . . To pass through the fire, or use divination, or be anobserver of times or an enchanter, or a witch, or a consulter with familiarspirits, or a necromancer.\" What difference was there then between all the above-enumerated phenomena asperformed by the \"other nations\" and when enacted by the prophets? Evidently,there was some good reason for it; and we find it in John's First Epistle, iv.,which says: \"believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are ofGod, because many false prophets are gone out into the world.\" The only standard within the reach of spiritualists and present-day mediums bywhich they can try the spirits, is to judge 1, by their actions and speech; 2,by their readiness to manifest themselves; and 3, whether the object in view isworthy of the apparition of a \"disembodied\" spirit, or can excuse any one fordisturbing the dead. Saul was on the eve of destruction, himself and his sons,yet Samuel inquired of him: \"Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_687] But the \"intelligences\"that visit the circle-rooms, come at the beck of every trifler who would whileaway a tedious hour. In the number of the London Spiritualist for July 14th, we find a long article,in which the author seeks to prove that \"the marvelous wonders of the presentday, which belong to so-called modern spiritualism, are identical in characterwith the experiences of the patriarchs and apostles of old.\" We are forced to contradict, point-blank, such an assertion. They are identicalonly so far that the same forces and occult powers of nature produce them. Butthough these powers and forces may be, and most assuredly are, all directed byunseen intelligences, the latter differ more in essence, character, and purposesthan mankind itself, composed, as it now stands, of white, black, brown, red,and yellow men, and numbering saints and criminals, geniuses and idiots. Thewriter may avail himself of the services of a tame orang-outang or a South Seaislander; but the fact alone that he has a servant makes neither the latter norhimself identical with Aristotle and Alexander. The writer compares Ezekiel\"lifted up\" and taken into the \"east gate of the Lord's house,\" ** with thelevitations of certain mediums, and the three Hebrew youths in the \"burningfiery furnace,\" with other fire-proof mediums; the John King \"spirit-light\" isassimilated with the \"burning lamp\" of Abraham; and finally, after many suchcomparisons, the case of the Davenport Brothers, released from the jail ofOswego, is confronted with that of Peter delivered from prison by the \"angel ofthe Lord\"! Now, except the story of Saul and Samuel, there is not a case instanced in theBible of the \"evocation of the dead.\" As to being lawful, the assertion iscontradicted by every prophet. Moses issues a decree of death against those whoraise the spirits of the dead, the \"necromancers.\" Nowhere throughout the OldTestament, nor in Homer, nor Virgil is communion with the dead termed otherwisethan necromancy. Philo Judaeus makes Saul say, that if he banishes from the land every divinerand necromancer his name will survive him. One of the greatest reasons for it was the doctrine of the ancients, that nosoul from the \"abode of the blessed\" will return to earth, unless, indeed, uponrare occasions its apparition might be required to accomplish some great objectin view, and so bring benefit upon humanity. In this latter instance the \"soul\"has no need to be evoked. It sent its portentous message either by an evanescentsimulacrum of itself, or through messengers, who could appear in material form,and personate faithfully the departed. The souls that could so easily be evokedwere deemed neither safe nor useful to commune with. They were the souls, orlarvae rather, from the infernal region of the limbo--the sheol, the regionknown by the kabalists as the eighth sphere, but far different from the orthodoxHell or Hades of the ancient mythologists. Horace describes this evocation andthe ceremonial accompanying it, and Maimonides gives us particulars of theJewish rite. Every necromantic ceremony was performed on high places and hills,and blood was used for the purpose of placating these human ghouls. * \"I cannot prevent the witches from picking up their bones,\" says the poet. \"Seethe blood they pour in the ditch to allure the souls that will utter theiroracles!\" ** \"Cruor in fossam confusus, ut inde manes elicirent, animas responsadaturas.\" \"The souls,\" says Porphyry, \"prefer, to everything else, freshly-spilt blood,which seems for a short time to restore to them some of the faculties oflife.\" *** As for materializations, they are many and various in the sacred records. But,were they effected under the same conditions as at modern seances? Darkness, itappears, was not required in those days of patriarchs and magic powers. Thethree angels who appeared to Abraham drank in the full blaze of the sun, for \"hesat in the tent-door in the heat of the day,\" ****says the book of Genesis. Thespirits of Elias and Moses appeared equally in daytime, as it is not probablethat Christ and the Apostles would be climbing a high mountain during the night.Jesus is represented as having appeared to Mary Magdalene in the garden in theearly morning; to the Apostles, at three distinct times, and generally by day;once \"when the morning was come\" (John xxi. 4). Even when the ass of Balaam sawthe \"materialized\" angel, it was in the full light of noon. We are fully prepared to agree with the writer in question, that we find in thelife of Christ--and we may add in the Old Testament, too—“an uninterruptedrecord of spiritualistic manifestations,\" but nothing mediumistic, of a physicalcharacter though, if we except the visit of Saul to Sedecla, the Obeah woman ofEn-Dor. This is a distinction of vital importance. True, the promise of the Master was clearly stated: \"Aye, and greater works thanthese shall ye do\"--works of mediatorship. According to Joel, the time wouldcome when there would be an outpouring of the divine spirit: \"Your sons and yourdaughters,\" says he, \"shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, youryoung men shall see visions.\" The time has come and they do all these thingsnow; Spiritualism has its seers and martyrs, its prophets and healers. LikeMoses, and David, and Jehoram, there are mediums who have direct writings fromgenuine planetary and human spirits; and the best of it brings the mediums nopecuniary recompense. The greatest friend of the cause in France, Leymarie, nowlanguishes in a prison-cell, and, as he says with touching pathos, is \"no longera man, but a number\" on the prison register. There are a few, a very few, orators on the spiritualistic platform who speak byinspiration, and if they know what is said at all they are in the conditiondescribed by Daniel: \"And I retained no strength. Yet heard I the voice of hiswords: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_693] And there are mediums,these whom we have spoken of, for whom the prophecy in Samuel might have beenwritten: \"The spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, thou shalt prophesy withthem, and shalt be turned into another man.\" ** But where, in the long line ofBible-wonders, do we read of flying guitars, and tinkling tambourines, andjangling bells being offered in pitch-dark rooms as evidences of immortality? When Christ was accused of casting out devils by the power of Beelzebub, hedenied it, and sharply retorted by asking, \"By whom do your sons or disciplescast them out?\" Again, spiritualists affirm that Jesus was a medium, that he wascontrolled by one or many spirits; but when the charge was made to him direct hesaid that he was nothing of the kind. \"Say we not well, that thou art aSamaritan, and hast a devil?\" daimonion, an Obeah, or familiar spirit in theHebrew text. Jesus answered, \"I have not a devil.\" *** The writer from whom we have above quoted, attempts also a parallel between theaerial flights of Philip and Ezekiel and of Mrs. Guppy and other modern mediums.He is ignorant or oblivious of the fact that while levitation occurred as aneffect in both classes of cases, the producing causes were totally dissimilar.The nature of this difference we have adverted to already. Levitation may beproduced consciously or unconsciously to the subject. The juggler determinesbeforehand that he will be levitated, for how long a time, and to what height;he regulates the occult forces accordingly. The fakir produces the same effectby the power of his aspiration and will, and, except when in the ecstatic state,keeps control over his movements. So does the priest of Siam, when, in thesacred pagoda, he mounts fifty feet in the air with taper in hand, and flitsfrom idol to idol, lighting up the niches, self-supported, and stepping asconfidently as though he were upon solid ground. This, persons have seen andtestify to. The officers of the Russian squadron which recently circumnavigatedthe globe, and was stationed for a long time in Japanese waters, relate the factthat, besides many other marvels, they saw jugglers walk in mid-air fromtree-top to tree-top, without the slightest support. *They also saw the pole andtape-climbing feats, described by Colonel Olcott in his People from the OtherWorld, and which have been so much called in question by certain spiritualistsand mediums whose zeal is greater than their learning. The quotations from Col.Yule and other writers, elsewhere given in this work, seem to place the matterbeyond doubt that these effects are produced. Such phenomena, when occurring apart from religious rites, in India, Japan,Thibet, Siam, and other \"heathen\" countries, phenomena a hundred times morevarious and astounding than ever seen in civilized Europe or America, are neverattributed to the spirits of the departed. The Pitris have naught to do withsuch public exhibitions. And we have but to consult the list of the principaldemons or elemental spirits to find that their very names indicate theirprofessions, or, to express it clearly, the tricks to which each variety is bestadapted. So we have the Madan, a generic name indicating wicked elementalspirits, half brutes, half monsters, for Madan signifies one that looks like acow. He is the friend of the malicious sorcerers and helps them to effect theirevil purposes of revenge by striking men and cattle with sudden illness anddeath. The Shudala-Madan, or graveyard fiend, answers to our ghouls. He delights wherecrime and murder were committed, near burial-spots and places of execution. Hehelps the juggler in all the fire-phenomena as well as Kutti Shattan, the littlejuggling imps. Shudala, they say, is a half-fire, half-water demon, for hereceived from Siva permission to assume any shape he chose, transform one thinginto another; and when he is not in fire, he is in water. It is he who blindspeople \"to see that which they do not see.\" Shula Madan, is another mischievousspook. He is the furnace-demon, skilled in pottery and baking. If you keepfriends with him, he will not injure you; but woe to him who incurs his wrath.Shula likes compliments and flattery, and as he generally keeps underground itis to him that a juggler must look to help him raise a tree from a seed in aquarter of an hour and ripen its fruit. Kumil-Madan, is the undine proper. He is an elemental spirit of the water, andhis name means blowing like a bubble. He is a very merry imp; and will help afriend in anything relative to his department; he will shower rain and show thefuture and the present to those who will resort to hydromancy or divination bywater. Poruthu Madan, is the \"wrestling\" demon; he is the strongest of all; andwhenever there are feats shown in which physical force is required, such aslevitations, or taming of wild animals, he will help the performer by keepinghim above the soil or will overpower a wild beast before the tamer has time toutter his incantation. So, every \"physical manifestation\" has its own class ofelemental spirits to superintend them. Returning now to levitations of human bodies and inanimate bodies, in moderncircle-rooms, we must refer the reader to the Introductory chapter of this work.(See \"AEthrobasy.\") In connection with the story of Simon the Magician, we haveshown the explanation of the ancients as to how the levitation and transport ofheavy bodies could be produced. We will now try and suggest a hypothesis for thesame in relation to mediums, i.e., persons supposed to be unconscious at themoment of the phenomena, which the believers claim to be produced by disembodied\"spirits.\" We need not repeat that which has been sufficiently explained before.Conscious aethrobasy under magneto-electrical conditions is possible only toadepts who can never be overpowered by an influence foreign to themselves, butremain sole masters of their WILL. Thus levitation, we will say, must always occur in obedience to law--a law asinexorable as that which makes a body unaffected by it remain upon the ground.And where should we seek for that law outside of the theory of molecularattraction? It is a scientific hypothesis that the form of force which firstbrings nebulous or star matter together into a whirling vortex is electricity;and modern chemistry is being totally reconstructed upon the theory of electricpolarities of atoms. The waterspout, the tornado, the whirlwind, the cyclone,and the hurricane, are all doubtless the result of electrical action. Thisphenomenon has been studied from above as well as from below, observationshaving been made both upon the ground and from a balloon floating above thevortex of a thunder-storm. Observe now, that this force, under the conditions of a dry and warm atmosphereat the earth's surface, can accumulate a dynamic energy capable of liftingenormous bodies of water, of compressing the particles of atmosphere, and ofsweeping across a country, tearing up forests, lifting rocks, and scatteringbuildings in fragments over the ground. Wild's electric machine causes inducedcurrents of magneto-electricity so enormously powerful as to produce light bywhich small print may be read, on a dark night, at a distance of two miles fromthe place where it is operating. As long ago as the year 1600, Gilbert, in his De Magnete, enunciated theprinciple that the globe itself is one vast magnet, and some of our advancedelectricians are now beginning to realize that man, too, possesses thisproperty, and that the mutual attractions and repulsions of individuals towardeach other may at least in part find their explanation in this fact. Theexperience of attendants upon spiritualistic circles corroborates this opinion.Says Professor Nicholas Wagner, of the University of St. Petersburg: \"Heat, orperhaps the electricity of the investigators sitting in the circle, mustconcentrate itself in the table and gradually develop into motions. At the sametime, or a little afterward, the psychical force unites to assist the two otherpowers. By psychical force, I mean that which evolves itself out of all theother forces of our organism. The combination into one general something ofseveral separate forces, and capable, when combined, of manifesting itself indegree, according to the individuality.\" The progress of the phenomena heconsiders to be affected by the cold or the dryness of the atmosphere. Now,remembering what has been said as to the subtler forms of energy which theHermetists have proved to exist in nature, and accepting the hypothesisenunciated by Mr. Wagner that \"the power which calls out these manifestations iscentred in the mediums,\" may not the medium, by furnishing in himself a nucleusas perfect in its way as the system of permanent steel magnets in Wild'sbattery, produce astral currents sufficiently strong to lift in their vortex abody even as ponderable as a human form? It is not necessary that the objectlifted should assume a gyratory motion, for the phenomenon we are observing,unlike the whirlwind, is directed by an intelligence, which is capable ofkeeping the body to be raised within the ascending current and preventing itsrotation. Levitation in this case would be a purely mechanical phenomenon. The inert bodyof the passive medium is lifted by a vortex created either by the elementalspirits--possibly, in some cases, by human ones, and sometimes through purelymorbific causes, as in the cases of Professor Perty's sick somnambules. Thelevitation of the adept is, on the contrary, a magneto-electric effect, as wehave just stated. He has made the polarity of his body opposite to that of theatmosphere, and identical with that of the earth; hence, attractable by theformer, retaining his consciousness the while. A like phenomenal levitation ispossible, also, when disease has changed the corporeal polarity of a patient, asdisease always does in a greater or lesser degree. But, in such case, the liftedperson would not be likely to remain conscious. In one series of observations upon whirlwinds, made in 1859, in the basin of theRocky Mountains, \"a newspaper was caught up . . . to a height of some twohundred feet; and there it oscillated to and fro across the track for someconsiderable time, whilst accompanying the onward motion.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_697] Of course scientists willsay that a parallel cannot be instituted between this case and that of humanlevitation; that no vortex can be formed in a room by which a medium could beraised; but this is a question of astral light and spirit, which have their ownpeculiar dynamical laws. Those who understand the latter, affirm that aconcourse of people laboring under mental excitement, which reacts upon thephysical system, throw off electromagnetic emanations, which, when sufficientlyintense, can throw the whole circumambient atmosphere into perturbation. Forceenough may actually be generated to create an electrical vortex, sufficientlypowerful to produce many a strange phenomenon. With this hint, the whirling ofthe dervishes, and the wild dances, swayings, gesticulations, music, and shoutsof devotees will be understood as all having a common object in view--namely,the creation of such astral conditions as favor psychological and physicalphenomena. The rationale of religious revivals will also be better understood ifthis principle is borne in mind. But there is still another point to be considered. If the medium is a nucleus ofmagnetism and a conductor of that force, he would be subject to the same laws asa metallic conductor, and be attracted to his magnet. If, therefore, a magneticcentre of the requisite power was formed directly over him by the unseen powerspresiding over the manifestations, why should not his body be lifted toward it,despite terrestrial gravity? We know that, in the case of a medium who isunconscious of the progress of the operation, it is necessary to first admit thefact of such an intelligence, and next, the possibility of the experiment beingconducted as described; but, in view of the multifarious evidences offered, notonly in our own researches, which claim no authority, but also in those of Mr.Crookes, and a great number of others, in many lands and at different epochs, weshall not turn aside from the main object of offering this hypothesis in theprofitless endeavor to strengthen a case which scientific men will not considerwith patience, even when sanctioned by the most distinguished of their own body. As early as 1836, the public was apprised of certain phenomena which were asextraordinary, if not more so than all the manifestations which are produced inour days. The famous correspondence between two well-known mesmerizers, Deleuzeand Billot, was published in France, and the wonders discussed for a time inevery society. Billot firmly believed in the apparition of spirits, for, as hesays, he has both seen, heard, and felt them. Deleuze was as much convinced ofthis truth as Billot, and declared that man's immortality and the return of thedead, or rather of their shadows, was the best demonstrated fact in his opinion.Material objects were brought to him from distant places by invisible hands, andhe communicated on most important subjects with the invisible intelligences. \"Inregard to this,\" he remarks, \"I cannot conceive how spiritual beings are able tocarry material objects.\" More skeptical, less intuitional than Billot,nevertheless, he agreed with the latter that \"the question of spiritualism isnot one of opinions, but of facts.\" Such is precisely the conclusion to which Professor Wagner, of St. Petersburg,was finally driven. In the second pamphlet on Mediumistic Phenomena, issued byhim in December, 1875, he administers the following rebuke to Mr. Shkliarevsky,one of his materialistic critics: \"So long as the spiritual manifestations wereweak and sporadic, we men of science could afford to deceive ourselves withtheories of unconscious muscular action, or unconscious cerebrations of ourbrains, and tumble the rest into one heap as juggleries. . . . But now thesewonders have grown too striking; the spirits show themselves in the shape oftangible, materialized forms, which can be touched and handled at will by anylearned skeptic like yourself, and even be weighed and measured. We can struggleno longer, for every resistance becomes absurd--it threatens lunacy. Try then torealize this, and to humble yourself before the possibility of impossiblefacts.\" Iron is only magnetized temporarily, but steel permanently, by contact with thelodestone. Now steel is but iron which has passed through a carbonizing process,and yet that process has quite changed the nature of the metal, so far as itsrelations to the lodestone are concerned. In like manner, it may be said thatthe medium is but an ordinary person who is magnetized by influx from the astrallight; and as the permanence of the magnetic property in the metal is measuredby its more or less steel-like character, so may we not say that the intensityand permanency of mediumistic power is in proportion to the saturation of themedium with the magnetic or astral force? This condition of saturation may be congenital, or brought about in anyone ofthese ways:--by the mesmeric process; by spirit-agency; or by self-will.Moreover, the condition seems hereditable, like any other physical or mentalpeculiarity; many, and we may even say most great mediums having had mediumshipexhibited in some form by one or more progenitors. Mesmeric subjects easily passinto the higher forms of clairvoyance and mediumship (now so called), asGregory, Deleuze, Puysegur, Du Potet, and other authorities inform us. As to theprocess of self-saturation, we have only to turn to the account of the priestlydevotees of Japan, Siam, China, India, Thibet, and Egypt, as well as of Europeancountries, to be satisfied of its reality. Long persistence in a fixeddetermination to subjugate matter, brings about a condition in which not only isone insensible to external impressions, but even death itself may be simulated,as we have already seen. The ecstatic so enormously reinforces his will-power,as to draw into himself, as into a vortex, the potencies resident in the astrallight to supplement his own natural store. The phenomena of mesmerism are explicable upon no other hypothesis than theprojection of a current of force from the operator into the subject. If a mancan project this force by an exercise of the will, what prevents his attractingit toward himself by reversing the current? Unless, indeed, it be urged that theforce is generated within his body and cannot be attracted from any supplywithout. But even under such an hypothesis, if he can generate a superabundantsupply to saturate another person, or even an inanimate object by his will, whycannot he generate it in excess for self-saturation? In his work on Anthropology, Professor J. R. Buchanan notes the tendency of thenatural gestures to follow the direction of the phrenological organs; theattitude of combativeness being downward and backward; that of hope andspirituality upward and forward; that of firmness upward and backward; and soon. The adepts of Hermetic science know this principle so well that they explainthe levitation of their own bodies, whenever it happens unawares, by saying thatthe thought is so intently fixed upon a point above them, that when the body isthoroughly imbued with the astral influence, it follows the mental aspirationand rises into the air as easily as a cork held beneath the water rises to thesurface when its buoyancy is allowed to assert itself. The giddiness felt bycertain persons when standing upon the brink of a chasm is explained upon thesame principle. Young children, who have little or no active imagination, and inwhom experience has not had sufficient time to develop fear, are seldom, ifever, giddy; but the adult of a certain mental temperament, seeing the chasm andpicturing in his imaginative fancy the consequences of a fall, allows himself tobe drawn by the attraction of the earth, and unless the spell of fascination bebroken, his body will follow his thought to the foot of the precipice. That this giddiness is purely a temperamental affair, is shown in the fact thatsome persons never experience the sensation, and inquiry will probably revealthe fact that such are deficient in the imaginative faculty. We have a case inview--a gentleman who, in 1858, had so firm a nerve that he horrified thewitnesses by standing upon the coping of the Arc de Triomphe, in Paris, withfolded arms, and his feet half over the edge; but, having since becomeshort-sighted, was taken with a panic upon attempting to cross a plank-walk overthe courtyard of a hotel, where the footway was more than two feet and a halfwide, and there was no danger. He looked at the flagging below, gave his fancyfree play, and would have fallen had he not quickly sat down. It is a dogma of science that perpetual motion is impossible; it is anotherdogma, that the allegation that the Hermetists discovered the elixir of life,and that certain of them, by partaking of it, prolonged their existence farbeyond the usual term, is a superstitious absurdity. And the claim that thebaser metals have been transmuted into gold, and that the universal solvent wasdiscovered, excites only contemptuous derision in a century which has crownedthe edifice of philosophy with a cope-stone of protoplasm. The first is declareda physical impossibility; as much so, according to Babinet, the astronomer, asthe \"levitation of an object without contact\"; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_698] the second, aphysiological vagary begotten of a disordered mind; the third, a chemicalabsurdity. Balfour Stewart says that while the man of science cannot assert that \"he isintimately acquainted with all the forces of nature, and cannot prove thatperpetual motion is impossible; for, in truth, he knows very little of theseforces . . . he does think that he has entered into the spirit and design ofnature, and therefore he denies at once the possibility of such a machine.\" **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_699] If he has discovered thedesign of nature, he certainly has not the spirit, for he denies its existencein one sense; and denying spirit he prevents that perfect understanding ofuniversal law which would redeem modern philosophy from its thousand mortifyingdilemmas and mistakes. If Professor B. Stewart's negation is founded upon nobetter analogy than that of his French contemporary, Babinet, he is in danger ofa like humiliating catastrophe. The universe itself illustrates the actuality ofperpetual motion; and the atomic theory, which has proved such a balm to theexhausted minds of our cosmic explorers, is based upon it. The telescopesearching through space, and the microscope probing the mysteries of the littleworld in a drop of water, reveal the same law in operation; and, as everythingbelow is like everything above, who would presume to say that when theconservation of energy is better understood, and the two additional forces ofthe kabalists are added to the catalogue of orthodox science, it may not bediscovered how to construct a machine which shall run without friction andsupply itself with energy in proportion to its wastes? \"Fifty years ago,\" saysthe venerable Mr. de Lara, \"a Hamburg paper, quoting from an English one anaccount of the opening of the Manchester and Liverpool Railway, pronounced it agross fabrication; capping the climax by saying, 'even so far extends thecredulity of the English' \"; the moral is apparent. The recent discovery of thecompound called METALLINE, by an American chemist, makes it appear probable thatfriction can, in a large degree, be overcome. One thing is certain, when a manshall have discovered the perpetual motion he will be able to understand byanalogy all the secrets of nature; progress in direct ratio with resistance. We may say the same of the elixir of life, by which is understood physical life,the soul being of course deathless only by reason of its divine immortal unionwith spirit. But continual or perpetual does not mean endless. The kabalistshave never claimed that either an endless physical life or unending motion ispossible. The Hermetic axiom maintains that only the First Cause and its directemanations, our spirits (scintillas from the eternal central sun which will bereabsorbed by it at the end of time) are incorruptible and eternal. But, inpossession of a knowledge of occult natural forces, yet undiscovered by thematerialists, they asserted that both physical life and mechanical motion couldbe prolonged indefinitely. The philosophers' stone had more than one meaningattached to its mysterious origin. Says Professor Wilder: \"The study of alchemywas even more universal than the several writers upon it appear to have known,and was always the auxiliary of, if not identical with, the occult sciences ofmagic, necromancy, and astrology; probably from the same fact that they wereoriginally but forms of a spiritualism which was generally extant in all ages ofhuman history.\" Our greatest wonder is, that the very men who view the human body simply as a\"digesting machine,\" should object to the idea that if some equivalent formetalline could be applied between its molecules, it should run withoutfriction. Man's body is taken from the earth, or dust, according to Genesis;which allegory bars the claims of modern analysts to original discovery of thenature of the inorganic constituents of human body. If the author of Genesisknew this, and Aristotle taught the identity between the life-principle ofplants, animals, and men, our affiliation with mother earth seems to have beensettled long ago. Elie de Beaumont has recently reasserted the old doctrine of Hermes that thereis a terrestrial circulation comparable to that of the blood of man. Now, sinceit is a doctrine as old as time, that nature is continually renewing her wastedenergies by absorption from the source of energy, why should the child differfrom the parent? Why may not man, by discovering the source and nature of thisrecuperative energy, extract from the earth herself the juice or quintessencewith which to replenish his own forces? This may have been the great secret ofthe alchemists. Stop the circulation of the terrestrial fluids and we havestagnation, putrefaction, death; stop the circulation of the fluids in man, andstagnation, absorption, calcification from old age, and death ensue. If thealchemists had simply discovered some chemical compound capable of keeping thechannels of our circulation unclogged, would not all the rest easily follow? Andwhy, we ask, if the surface-waters of certain mineral springs have such virtuein the cure of disease and the restoration of physical vigor, is it illogical tosay that if we could get the first runnings from the alembic of nature in thebowels of the earth, we might, perhaps, find that the fountain of youth was nomyth after all. Jennings asserts that the elixir was produced out of the secretchemical laboratories of nature by some adepts; and Robert Boyle, the chemist,mentions a medicated wine or cordial which Dr. Lefevre tried with wonderfuleffect upon an old woman. Alchemy is as old as tradition itself. \"The first authentic record on thissubject,\" says William Godwin, \"is an edict of Diocletian, about 300 years afterChrist, ordering a diligent search to be made in Egypt for all the ancient bookswhich treated of the art of making gold and silver, that they might be consignedto the flames. This edict necessarily presumes a certain antiquity to thepursuit; and fabulous history has recorded Solomon, Pythagoras, and Hermes amongits distinguished votaries.\" And this question of transmutation--this alkahest or universal solvent, whichcomes next after the elixir vitae in the order of the three alchemical agents?Is the idea so absurd as to be totally unworthy of consideration in this age ofchemical discovery? How shall we dispose of the historical anecdotes of men whoactually made gold and gave it away, and of those who testify to having seenthem do it? Libavius, Geberus, Arnoldus, Thomas Aquinas, Bernardus Comes,Joannes, Penotus, Quercetanus Geber, the Arabian father of European alchemy,Eugenius Philalethes, Baptista Porta, Rubeus, Dornesius, Vogelius, IrenaeusPhilaletha Cosmopolita, and many mediaeval alchemists and Hermetic philosophersassert the fact. Must we believe them all visionaries and lunatics, theseotherwise great and learned scholars? Francesco Picus, in his work De Auro,gives eighteen instances of gold being produced in his presence by artificialmeans; and Thomas Vaughan, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_700] going to a goldsmith tosell 1,200 marks worth of gold, when the man suspiciously remarked that the goldwas too pure to have ever come out of a mine, ran away, leaving the money behindhim. In a preceding chapter we have brought forward the testimony of a number ofauthors to this effect. Marco Polo tells us that in some mountains of Thibet, which he callsChingintalas, there are veins of the substance from which Salamander is made:\"For the real truth is, that the salamander is no beast, as they allege in ourparts of the world, but is a substance found in the earth.\" **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_701] Then he adds that a Turkof the name of Zurficar, told him that he had been procuring salamanders for theGreat Khan, in those regions, for the space of three years. \"He said that theway they got them was by digging in that mountain till they found a certainvein. The substance of this vein was then taken and crushed, and, when sotreated, it divides, as it were, into fibres of wool, which they set forth todry. When dry, these fibres were pounded and washed, so as to leave only thefibres, like fibres of wool. These were then spun. . . . When first made, thesenapkins are not very white, but, by putting them into the fire for a while, theycome out as white as snow.\" Therefore, as several authorities testify, this mineral substance is the famousAsbestos, *** [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_702] which theRev. A. Williamson says is found in Shantung. But, it is not only incombustiblethread which is made from it. An oil, having several most extraordinaryproperties, is extracted from it, and the secret of its virtues remains withcertain lamas and Hindu adepts. When rubbed into the body, it leaves no externalstain or mark, but, nevertheless, after having been so rubbed, the part can bescrubbed with soap and hot or cold water, without the virtue of the ointmentbeing affected in the least. The person so rubbed may boldly step into thehottest fire; unless suffocated, he will remain uninjured. Another property ofthe oil is that, when combined with another substance, that we are not atliberty to name, and left stagnant under the rays of the moon, on certain nightsindicated by native astrologers, it will breed strange creatures. Infusoria wemay call them in one sense, but then these grow and develop. Speaking ofKashmere, Marco Polo observes that they have an astonishing acquaintance withthe devilries of enchantment, insomuch that they make their idols to speak. To this day, the greatest magian mystics of these regions may be found inKashmere. The various religious sects of this country were always credited withpreternatural powers, and were the resort of adepts and sages. As Colonel Yuleremarks, \"Vambery tells us that even in our day, the Kasmiri dervishes arepreeminent among their Mahometan brethren for cunning, secret arts, skill inexorcisms and magic.\" * But, all modern chemists are not equally dogmatic in their negation of thepossibility of such a transmutation. Dr. Peisse, Desprez, and even theall-denying Louis Figuier, of Paris, seem to be far from rejecting the idea. Dr.Wilder says: \"The possibility of reducing the elements to their primal form, asthey are supposed to have existed in the igneous mass from which the earth-crustis believed to have been formed, is not considered by physicists to be so absurdan idea as has been intimated. There is a relationship between metals, often soclose as to indicate an original identity. Persons called alchemists may,therefore, have devoted their energies to investigations into these matters, asLavoisier, Davy, Faraday, and others of our day have explained the mysteries ofchemistry.\" ** A learned Theosophist, a practicing physician of this country,one who has studied the occult sciences and alchemy for over thirty years, hassucceeded in reducing the elements to their primal form, and made what is termed\"the pre-Adamite earth.\" It appears in the form of an earthy precipitate frompure water, which, on being disturbed, presents the most opalescent and vividcolors. \"The secret,\" say the alchemists, as if enjoying the ignorance of theuninitiated, \"is an amalgamation of the salt, sulphur, and mercury combinedthree times in Azoth, by a triple sublimation and a triple fixation.\" \"How ridiculously absurd!\" will exclaim a learned modern chemist. Well, thedisciples of the great Hermes understand the above as well as a graduate ofHarvard University comprehends the meaning of his Professor of Chemistry, whenthe latter says: \"With one hydroxyl group we can only produce monatomiccompounds; use two hydroxyl groups, and we can form around the same skeleton anumber of diatomic compounds. . . . Attach to the nucleus three hydroxyl groups, and there result triatomiccompounds, among which is a very familiar substance [images/00006.jpg] Glycerine.\"\"Attach thyself,\" says the alchemist, \"to the four letters of the tetragramdisposed in the following manner: [images/00007.jpg] The letters of the ineffable name are there, although thou mayest not discernthem at first. The incommunicable axiom is kabalistically contained therein, andthis is what is called the magic arcanum by the masters.\" The arcanum--thefourth emanation of the Akasa, the principle of LIFE, which is represented inits third transmutation by the fiery sun, the eye of the world, or of Osiris, asthe Egyptians termed it. An eye tenderly watching its youngest daughter, wife,and sister--Isis, our mother earth. See what Hermes, the thrice-great master,says of her: \"Her father is the sun, her mother is the moon.\" It attracts andcaresses, and then repulses her by a projectile power. It is for the Hermeticstudent to watch its motions, to catch its subtile currents, to guide and directthem with the help of the athanor, the Archimedean lever of the alchemist. Whatis this mysterious athanor? Can the physicist tell us--he who sees and examinesit daily? Aye, he sees; but does he comprehend the secret-ciphered characterstraced by the divine finger on every sea-shell in the ocean's deep; on everyleaf that trembles in the breeze; in the bright star, whose stellar lines are inhis sight but so many more or less luminous lines of hydrogen? \"God geometrizes,\" said Plato. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_705] \"The laws of nature arethe thoughts repeated the solitary student of Hermetic lore, \"therefore it is inthe perfect harmony and equilibrium of all things that we must seek the truth.\"And thus, proceeding from the indivisible unity, he found emanating from it twocontrary forces, each acting through the other and producing equilibrium, andthe three were but one, the Pythagorean Eternal Monad. The primordial point is acircle; the circle squaring itself from the four cardinal points becomes aquaternary, the perfect square, having at each of its four angles a letter ofthe mirific name, the sacred TETRAGRAM. It is the four Buddhas who came and havepassed away; the Pythagorean tetractys--absorbed and resolved by the one eternalNO-BEING. Tradition declares that on the dead body of Hermes, at Hebron, was found by anIsarim, an initiate, the tablet known as the Smaragdine. It contains, in a fewsentences, the essence of the Hermetic wisdom. To those who read but with theirbodily eyes, the precepts will suggest nothing new or extraordinary, for itmerely begins by saying that it speaks not fictitious things, but that which istrue and most certain. \"What is below is like that which is above, and what is above is similar to thatwhich is below to accomplish the wonders of one thing. \"As all things were produced by the mediation of one being, so all things wereproduced from this one by adaptation. \"Its father is the sun, its mother is the moon. \"It is the cause of all perfection throughout the whole earth. \"Its power is perfect if it is changed into earth. \"Separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from the gross, acting prudentlyand with judgment. \"Ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven, and then descendagain to earth, and unite together the power of things inferior and superior;thus you will possess the light of the whole world, and all obscurity will flyaway from you. \"This thing has more fortitude than fortitude itself, because it will overcomeevery subtile thing and penetrate every solid thing. \"By it the world was formed.\" This mysterious thing is the universal, magical agent, the astral light, whichin the correlations of its forces furnishes the alkahest, the philosopher'sstone, and the elixir of life. Hermetic philosophy names it Azoth, the soul ofthe world, the celestial virgin, the great Magnes, etc., etc. Physical scienceknows it as \"heat, light, electricity, and magnetism\"; but ignoring itsspiritual properties and the occult potency contained in ether, rejectseverything it ignores. It explains and depicts the crystalline forms of thesnow-flakes, their modifications of an hexagonal prism which shoot out aninfinity of delicate needles. It has studied them so perfectly that it has evencalculated, with the most wondrous mathematical precision, that all theseneedles diverge from each other at an angle of 60°. Can it tell us as well thecause of this \"endless variety of the most exquisite forms,\" * each of which isa most perfect geometrical figure in itself? These frozen, starlike andflower-like blossoms, may be, for all materialistic science knows, a shower ofmessages snowed by spiritual hands from the worlds above for spiritual eyesbelow to read. The philosophical cross, the two lines running in opposite directions, thehorizontal and the perpendicular, the height and breadth, which the geometrizingDeity divides at the intersecting point, and which forms the magical as well asthe scientific quaternary, when it is inscribed within the perfect square, isthe basis of the occultist. Within its mystical precinct lies the master-keywhich opens the door of every science, physical as well as spiritual. Itsymbolizes our human existence, for the circle of life circumscribes the fourpoints of the cross, which represent in succession birth, life, death, andIMMORTALITY. Everything in this world is a trinity completed by thequaternary, ** and every element is divisible on this same principle. Physiologycan divide man ad infinitum, as physical science has divided the four primal andprincipal elements in several dozens of others; she will not succeed in changingeither. Birth, life, and death will ever be a trinity completed only at thecyclic end. Even were science to change the longed-for immortality intoannihilation, it still will ever be a quaternary; for God \"geometrizes!\" Therefore, perhaps alchemy will one day be allowed to talk of her salt, mercury,sulphur, and azoth, her symbols and mirific letters, and repeat, with theexponent of the Synthesis of Organic Compounds, that \"it must be remembered thatthe grouping is no play of fancy, and that a good reason can be given for theposition of every letter.\" *** Dr. Peisse, of Paris, wrote in 1863, the following: \"One word, a propos, of alchemy. What must we think of the Hermetic art? Is itlawful to believe that we can transmute metals, make gold? Well, positive men,esprits forts of the nineteenth century, know that Mr. Figuier, doctor ofscience and medicine, chemical analyst in the School of Pharmacy, of Paris, doesnot wish to express himself upon the subject. He doubts, he hesitates. He knowsseveral alchemists (for there are such) who, basing themselves upon modernchemical discoveries, and especially on the singular circumstance of theequivalents demonstrated by M. Dumas, pretend that metals are not simple bodies,true elements in the absolute sense, and that in consequence they may beproduced by the process of decomposition. . . . This encourages me to take astep further, and candidly avow that I would be only moderately surprised to seesome one make gold. I have only one reason to give, but sufficient it seems;which is, that gold has not always existed; it has been made by some chemicaltravail or other in the bosom of the fused matter of our globe; *perhaps some ofit may be even now in process of formation. The pretended simple bodies of ourchemistry are very probably secondary products, in the formation of theterrestrial mass. It has been proved so with water, one of the most respectableelements of ancient physics. To-day, we create water. Why should we not makegold? An eminent experimentalist, Mr. Desprez, has made the diamond. True, thisdiamond is only a scientific diamond, a philosophical diamond, which would beworth nothing; but, no matter, my position holds good. Besides, we are not leftto simple conjectures. There is a man living, who, in a paper addressed to thescientific bodies, in 1853, has underscored these words--I have discovered themethod of producing artificial gold, I have made gold. This adept is Mr.Theodore Tiffereau, ex-preparator of chemistry in the Ecole Professionelle etSuperieure of Nantes.\" ** Cardinal de Rohan, the famous victim of the diamondnecklace conspiracy, testified that he had seen the Count Cagliostro make bothgold and diamonds. We presume that those who agree with Professor T. SterryHunt, F.R.S., will have no patience with the theory of Dr. Peisse, for theybelieve that all of our metalliferous deposits are due to the action of organiclife. And so, until they do come to some composition of their differences, so asto let us know for a certainty the nature of gold, and whether it is the productof interior volcanic alchemy or surface segregation and filtration, we willleave them to settle their quarrel between themselves, and give credit meanwhileto the old philosophers. Professor Balfour Stewart, whom no one would think of classing among illiberalminds; who, with far more fairness and more frequently than any of hiscolleagues admits the failings of modern science, shows himself, nevertheless,as biassed as other scientists on this question. Perpetual light being onlyanother name for perpetual motion, he tells us, and the latter being impossiblebecause we have no means of equilibrating the waste of combustible material, aHermetic light is, therefore, an impossibility. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_711] Noting the fact that a\"perpetual light was supposed to result from magical powers,\" and remarkingfurther that such a light is \"certainly not of this earth, where light and allother forms of superior energy are essentially evanescent,\" this gentlemanargues as though the Hermetic philosophers had always claimed that the flameunder discussion was an ordinary earthly flame, resulting from the combustion ofluminiferous material. In this the philosophers have been constantlymisunderstood and misrepresented. How many great minds--unbelievers from the start--after having studied the\"secret doctrine,\" have changed their opinions and found out how mistaken theywere. And how contradictory it seems to find one moment Balfour Stewart quotingsome philosophical morals of Bacon--whom he terms the father of experimentalscience--and saying \" . . . surely we ought to learn a lesson from these remarks. . . and be very cautious before we dismiss any branch of knowledge or train ofthought as essentially unprofitable,\" and then dismissing the next moment, asutterly impossible, the claims of the alchemists! He shows Aristotle as\"entertaining the idea that light is not any body, or the emanation of any body,and that therefore light is an energy or act\"; and yet, although the ancientswere the first to show, through Demokritus, to John Dalton the doctrine ofatoms, and through Pythagoras and even the oldest of the Chaldean oracles, thatof ether as a universal agent, their ideas, says Stewart, \"were not prolific.\"He admits that they \"possessed great genius and intellectual power,\" but addsthat \"they were deficient in physical conceptions, and, in consequence, theirideas were not prolific.\" ** The whole of the present work is a protest against such a loose way of judgingthe ancients. To be thoroughly competent to criticise their ideas, and assureone's self whether their ideas were distinct and \"appropriate to the facts,\" onemust have sifted these ideas to the very bottom. It is idle to repeat that whichwe have frequently said, and that which every scholar ought to know; namely,that the quintessence of their knowledge was in the hands of the priests, whonever wrote them, and in those of the \"initiates\" who, like Plato, did not darewrite them. Therefore, those few speculations on the material and spiritual universes, whichthey did put in writing, could not enable posterity to judge them rightly, evenhad not the early Christian Vandals, the later crusaders, and the fanatics ofthe middle ages destroyed three parts of that which remained of the Alexandrianlibrary and its later schools. Professor Draper shows that the Cardinal Ximenesalone \"delivered to the flames in the squares of Granada, 80,000 Arabicmanuscripts, many of them translations of classical authors.\" In the Vaticanlibraries, whole passages in the most rare and precious treatises of theancients were found erased and blotted out, for the sake of interlining themwith absurd psalmodies! Who then, of those who turn away from the \"secret doctrine\" as being\"unphilosophical\" and, therefore, unworthy of a scientific thought, has a rightto say that he studied the ancients; that he is aware of all that they knew, andknowing now far more, knows also that they knew little, if anything. This\"secret doctrine\" contains the alpha and the omega of universal science; thereinlies the corner and the keystone of all the ancient and modern knowledge; andalone in this \"unphilosophical\" doctrine remains buried the absolute in thephilosophy of the dark problems of life and death. \"The great energies of Nature are known to us only by their effects,\" saidPaley. Paraphrasing the sentence, we will say that the great achievements of thedays of old are known to posterity only by their effects. If one takes a book onalchemy, and sees in it the speculations on gold and light by the brothers ofthe Rosie Cross, he will find himself certainly startled, for the simple reasonthat he will not understand them at all. \"The Hermetic gold,\" he may read, \"isthe outflow of the sunbeam, or of light suffused invisibly and magically intothe body of the world. Light is sublimated gold, rescued magically by invisiblestellar attraction, out of material depths. Gold is thus the deposit of light,which of itself generates. Light in the celestial world is subtile, vaporous,magically exalted gold, or 'spirit of flame.' Gold draws inferior natures in themetals, and intensifying and multiplying, converts into itself.\" * Nevertheless, facts are facts; and, as Billot says of spiritualism, we willremark of occultism generally and of alchemy in particular--it is not a matterof opinion but of facts, men of science call an inextinguishable lamp animpossibility, but nevertheless persons in our own age as well as in the days ofignorance and superstition have found them burning bright in old vaults shut upfor centuries; and other persons there are who possess the secret of keepingsuch fires for several ages. Men of science say that ancient and modernspiritualism, magic, and mesmerism, are charlatanry or delusion; but there are800 millions on the face of the globe, of perfectly sane men and women, whobelieve in all these. Whom are we to credit? \"Demokritus,\" says Lucian, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_714] \"believed in no (miracles). . . he applied himself to discover the method by which the theurgists couldproduce them; in a word, his philosophy brought him to the conclusion that magicwas entirely confined to the application and the imitation of the laws and theworks of nature.\" Now, the opinion of the \"laughing philosopher\" is of the greatest importance tous, since the Magi left by Xerxes, at Abdera, were his instructors, and he hadstudied magic, moreover, for a considerably long time with the Egyptianpriests. ** For nearly ninety years of the one hundred and nine of his life,this great philosopher had made experiments, and noted them down in a book,which, according to Petronius, *** treated of nature--facts that he had verifiedhimself. And we find him not only disbelieving in and utterly rejectingmiracles, but asserting that every one of those that were authenticated byeye-witnesses, had, and could have taken place; for all, even the mostincredible, was produced according to the \"hidden laws of nature.\" **** \"The day will never come, when any one of the propositions of Euclid will bedenied,\" ***** says Professor Draper, exalting the Aristoteleans at the expenseof the Pythagoreans and Platonists. Shall we, in such a case, disbelieve anumber of well-informed authorities (Lempriere among others), who assert thatthe fifteen books of the Elements are not to be wholly attributed to Euclid; andthat many of the most valuable truths and demonstrations contained in them owetheir existence to Pythagoras, Thales, and Eudoxus? That Euclid, notwithstandinghis genius, was the first who reduced them to order, and only interwove theoriesof his own to render the whole a complete and connected system of geometry? Andif these authorities are right, then it is again to that central sun ofmetaphysical science--Pythagoras and his school, that the moderns are indebteddirectly for such men as Eratosthenes, the world-famous geometer andcosmographer, Archimedes, and even Ptolemy, notwithstanding his obstinateerrors. Were it not for the exact science of such men, and for fragments oftheir works that they left us to base Galilean speculations upon, the greatpriests of the nineteenth century might find themselves, perhaps, still in thebondage of the Church; and philosophizing, in 1876, on the Augustine and Bedeancosmogony, the rotation of the canopy of heaven round the earth, and themajestic flatness of the latter. The nineteenth century seems positively doomed to humiliating confessions.Feltre (Italy) erects a public statue \"to Panfilo Castaldi, the illustriousinventor of movable printing types,\" and adds in its inscription the generousconfession that Italy renders to him \"this tribute of honor too long deferred.\"But no sooner is the statue placed, than the Feltreians are advised by ColonelYule to \"burn it in honest lime.\" He proves that many a traveller besides MarcoPolo had brought home from China movable wooden types and specimens of Chinesebooks, the entire text of which was printed with such wooden blocks. * We haveseen in several Thibetan lamaseries, where they have printing-offices, suchblocks preserved as curiosities. They are known to be of the greatest antiquity,inasmuch as types were perfected, and the old ones abandoned contemporaneouslywith the earliest records of Buddhistic lamaism. Therefore, they must haveexisted in China before the Christian era. Let every one ponder over the wise words of Professor Roscoe, in his lecture onSpectrum Analysis. \"The infant truths must be made useful. Neither you nor I,perhaps, can see the how or the when, but that the time may come at any moment,when the most obscure of nature's secrets shall at once be employed for thebenefit of mankind, no one who knows anything of science, can for one instantdoubt. Who could have foretold that the discovery that a dead frog's legs jumpwhen they are touched by two different metals, should have led in a few shortyears to the discovery of the electric telegraph?\" Professor Roscoe, visiting Kirchhoff and Bunsen when they were making theirgreat discoveries of the nature of the Fraunhoffer lines, says that it flashedupon his mind at once that there is iron in the sun; therein presenting one moreevidence to add to a million predecessors, that great discoveries usually comewith a flash, and not by induction. There are many more flashes in store for us.It may be found, perhaps, that one of the last sparkles of modern science--thebeautiful green spectrum of silver--is nothing new, but was, notwithstanding thepaucity \"and great inferiority of their optical instruments,\" well known to theancient chemists and physicists. Silver and green were associated together asfar back as the days of Hermes. Luna, or Astarte (the Hermetic silver), is oneof the two chief symbols of the Rosicrucians. It is a Hermetic axiom, that \"thecause of the splendor and variety of colors lies deep in the affinities ofnature; and that there is a singular and mysterious alliance between color andsound.\" The kabalists place their \"middle nature\" in direct relation with themoon; and the green ray occupies the centre point between the others, beingplaced in the middle of the spectrum. The Egyptian priests chanted the sevenvowels as a hymn addressed to Serapis; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu012.htm#fn_720] and at the sound of theseventh vowel, as at the \"seventh ray\" of the rising sun, the statue of Memnonresponded. Recent discoveries have proved the wonderful properties of theblue-violet light--the seventh ray of the prismatic spectrum, the mostpowerfully chemical of all, which corresponds with the highest note in themusical scale. The Rosicrucian theory, that the whole universe is a musicalinstrument, is the Pythagorean doctrine of the music of the spheres. Sounds andcolors are all spiritual numerals; as the seven prismatic rays proceed from onespot in heaven, so the seven powers of nature, each of them a number, are theseven radiations of the Unity, the central, spiritual SUN. \"Happy is he who comprehends the spiritual numerals, and perceives their mightyinfluence!\" exclaims Plato. And happy, we may add, is he who, treading the mazeof force-correlations, does not neglect to trace them to this invisible Sun! Future experimenters will reap the honor of demonstrating that musical toneshave a wonderful effect upon the growth of vegetation. And with the enunciationof this unscientific fallacy, we will close the chapter, and proceed to remindthe patient reader of certain things that the ancients knew, and the modernsthink they know.

Will notthe historian deign to notice the prior origin of every art and science inEgypt, a thousand years before the Pelasgians studded the isles and capes of theArchipelago with their forts and temples?\"--GLIDDON.HOW came Egypt by her knowledge? When broke the dawn of that civilization whosewondrous perfection is suggested by the bits and fragments supplied to us by thearchaeologists? Alas! the lips of Memnon are silent, and no longer utteroracles; the Sphinx has become a greater riddle in her speechlessness than wasthe enigma propounded to OEdipus. What Egypt taught to others she certainly did not acquire by the internationalexchange of ideas and discoveries with her Semitic neighbors, nor from them didshe receive her stimulus. \"The more we learn of the Egyptians,\" observes thewriter of a recent article, \"the more marvellous they seem!\" From whom could shehave learned her wondrous arts, the secrets of which died with her? She sent noagents throughout the world to learn what others knew; but to her the wise menof neighboring nations resorted for knowledge. Proudly secluding herself withinher enchanted domain, the fair queen of the desert created wonders as if by thesway of a magic staff. \"Nothing,\" remarks the same writer, whom we haveelsewhere quoted, \"proves that civilization and knowledge then rise and progresswith her as in the case of other peoples, but everything seems to be referable,in the same perfection, to the earliest dates. That no nation knew as much asherself, is a fact demonstrated by history.\" May we not assign as a reason for this remark the fact that until very recentlynothing was known of Old India? That these two nations, India and Egypt, wereakin? That they were the oldest in the group of nations; and that the EasternEthiopians--the mighty builders--had come from India as a matured people,bringing their civilization with them, and colonizing the perhaps unoccupiedEgyptian territory? But we defer a more complete elaboration of this theme forour second volume. * \"Mechanism,\" says Eusebe Salverte, \"was carried by the ancients to a point ofperfection that has never been attained in modern times. We would inquire iftheir inventions have been surpassed in our age? Certainly not; and at thepresent day, with all the means that the progress of science and moderndiscovery have placed in the hands of the mechanic, have we not been assailed bynumerous difficulties in striving to place on a pedestal one of those monolithsthat the Egyptians forty centuries ago erected in such numbers before theirsacred edifices.\" As far back as we can glance into history, to the reign of Menes, the mostancient of the kings that we know anything about, we find proofs that theEgyptians were far better acquainted with hydrostatics and hydraulic engineeringthan ourselves. The gigantic work of turning the course of the Nile--or ratherof its three principal branches--and bringing it to Memphis, was accomplishedduring the reign of that monarch, who appears to us as distant in the abyss oftime as a far-glimmering star in the heavenly vault. Says Wilkinson: \"Menes tookaccurately the measure of the power which he had to oppose, and he constructed adyke whose lofty mounds and enormous embankments turned the water eastward, andsince that time the river is contained in its new bed.\" Herodotus has left us apoetical, but still accurate description of the lake Moeris, so called after thePharaoh who caused this artificial sheet of water to be formed. The historian has described this lake as measuring 450 miles in circumference,and 300 feet in depth. It was fed through artificial channels by the Nile, andmade to store a portion of the annual overflow for the irrigation of thecountry, for many miles round. Its numerous floodgates, dams, locks, andconvenient engines were constructed with the greatest skill. The Romans, at afar later period, got their notions on hydraulic constructions from theEgyptians, but our latest progress in the science of hydrostatics hasdemonstrated the fact of a great deficiency on their part in some branches ofthat knowledge. Thus, for instance, if they were acquainted with that which iscalled in hydrostatics the great law, they seem to have been less familiar withwhat our modern engineers know as water-tight joints. Their ignorance issufficiently proved by their conveying the water through large level aqueducts,instead of doing it at a less expense by iron pipes beneath the surface. But theEgyptians evidently employed a far superior method in their channels andartificial water-works. Notwithstanding this, the modern engineers employed byLesseps for the Suez Canal, who had learned from the ancient Romans all theirart could teach them, deriving, in their turn, their knowledge fromEgypt--scoffed at the suggestion that they should seek a remedy for someimperfections in their work by studying the contents of the various Egyptianmuseums. Nevertheless, the engineers succeeded in giving to the banks of that\"long and ugly ditch,\" as Professor Carpenter calls the Suez Canal, sufficientstrength to make it a navigable water-way, instead of a mud-trap for vessels asit was at first. The alluvial deposits of the Nile, during the past thirty centuries, havecompletely altered the area of the Delta, so that it is continually growingseaward, and adding to the territory of the Khedive. In ancient times, theprincipal mouth of the river was called Pelusian; and the canal cut by one ofthe kings--the canal of Necho--led from Suez to this branch. After the defeat ofAntony and Cleopatra, at Actium, it was proposed that a portion of the fleetshould pass through the canal to the Red Sea, which shows the depth of waterthat those early engineers had secured. Settlers in Colorado and Arizona haverecently reclaimed large tracts of barren land by a system of irrigation;receiving from the journals of the day no little praise for their ingenuity.But, for a distance of 500 miles above Cairo, there stretches a strip of landreclaimed from the desert, and made, according to Professor Carpenter, \"the mostfertile on the face of the earth.\" He says, \"for thousands of years these branchcanals have conveyed fresh water from the Nile, to fertilize the land of thislong narrow strip, as well as of the Delta.\" He describes \"the net-work ofcanals over the Delta, which dates from an early period of the Egyptianmonarchs.\" The French province of Artois has given its name to the Artesian well, as thoughthat form of engineering had been first applied in that district; but, if weconsult the Chinese records, we find such wells to have been in common use agesbefore the Christian era. If we now turn to architecture, we find displayed before our eyes, wonders whichbaffle all description. Referring to the temples of Philae, Abu Simbel, Dendera,Edfu, and Karnak, Professor Carpenter remarks that \"these stupendous andbeautiful erections . . . these gigantic pyramids and temples\" have a \"vastnessand beauty\" which are \"still impressive after the lapse of thousands of years.\"He is amazed at \"the admirable character of the workmanship; the stones in mostcases being fitted together with astonishing nicety, so that a knife couldhardly be thrust between the joints.\" He noticed in his amateur archaeologicalpilgrimage, another of those \"curious coincidences\" which his Holiness, thePope, may feel some interest in learning. He is speaking of the Egyptian Book ofthe Dead, sculptured on the old monuments, and the ancient belief in theimmortality of the soul. \"Now, it is most remarkable,\" says the professor, \"tosee that not only this belief, but the language in which it was expressed in theancient Egyptian times, anticipated that of the Christian Revelation. For, inthis Book of the Dead, there are used the very phrases we find in the NewTestament, in connection with the day of judgment\"; and he admits that thishierogram was \"engraved, probably, 2,000 years before the time of Christ.\" According to Bunsen, who is considered to have made the most exact calculations,the mass of masonry in the great Pyramid of Cheops measures 82,111,000 feet, andwould weigh 6,316,000 tons. The immense numbers of squared stones show us theunparalleled skill of the Egyptian quarrymen. Speaking of the great pyramid,Kenrick says: \"The joints are scarcely perceptible, not wider than the thicknessof silver paper, and the cement is so tenacious, that fragments of thecasing-stones still remain in their original position, notwithstanding the lapseof many centuries, and the violence by which they were detached.\" Who, of ourmodern architects and chemists, will rediscover the indestructible cement of theoldest Egyptian buildings? \"The skill of the ancients in quarrying,\" says Bunsen, \"is displayed the most inthe extracting of the huge blocks, out of which obelisks and colossal statueswere hewn--obelisks ninety feet high, and statues forty feet high, made out ofone stone!\" There are many such. They did not blast out the blocks for thesemonuments, but adopted the following scientific method: Instead of using hugeiron wedges, which would have split the stone, they cut a small groove for thewhole length of, perhaps, 100 feet, and inserted in it, close to each other, agreat number of dry wooden wedges; after which they poured water into thegroove, and the wedges swelling and bursting simultaneously, with a tremendousforce, broke out the huge stone, as neatly as a diamond cuts a pane of glass. Modern geographers and geologists have demonstrated that these monoliths werebrought from a prodigious distance, and have been at a loss to conjecture howthe transport was effected. Old manuscripts say that it was done by the help ofportable rails. These rested upon inflated bags of hide, rendered indestructibleby the same process as that used for preserving the mummies. These ingeniousair-cushions prevented the rails from sinking in the deep sand. Manetho mentionsthem, and remarks that they were so well prepared that they would endure wearand tear for centuries. The date of the hundreds of pyramids in the Valley of the Nile is impossible tofix by any of the rules of modern science; but Herodotus informs us that eachsuccessive king erected one to commemorate his reign, and serve as hissepulchre. But, Herodotus did not tell all, although he knew that the realpurpose of the pyramid was very different from that which he assigns to it. Wereit not for his religious scruples, he might have added that, externally, itsymbolized the creative principle of nature, and illustrated also the principlesof geometry, mathematics, astrology, and astronomy. Internally, it was amajestic fane, in whose sombre recesses were performed the Mysteries, and whosewalls had often witnessed the initiation-scenes of members of the royal family.The porphyry sarcophagus, which Professor Piazzi Smyth, Astronomer Royal ofScotland, degrades into a corn-bin, was the baptismal font, upon emerging fromwhich, the neophyte was \"born again,\" and became an adept. Herodotus gives us, however, a just idea of the enormous labor expended intransporting one of these gigantic blocks of granite. It measured thirty-twofeet in length, twenty-one feet in width, and twelve feet in height. Its weighthe estimates to be rising 300 tons, and it occupied 2,000 men for three years tomove it from Syene to the Delta, down the Nile. Gliddon, in his Ancient Egypt,quotes from Pliny a description of the arrangements for moving the obeliskerected at Alexandria by Ptolemaeus Philadelphus. A canal was dug from the Nileto the place where the obelisk lay. Two boats were floated under it; they wereweighted with stones containing one cubic foot each, and the weight of theobelisk having been calculated by the engineers, the cargo of the boats wasexactly proportioned to it, so that they should be sufficiently submerged topass under the monolith as it lay across the canal. Then, the stones weregradually removed, the boats rose, lifted the obelisk, and it was floated downthe river. In the Egyptian section of the Dresden, or Berlin Museum, we forget which, is adrawing which represents a workman ascending an unfinished pyramid, with abasket of sand upon his back. This has suggested to certain Egyptologists theidea that the blocks of the pyramids were chemically manufactured in loco. Somemodern engineers believe that Portland cement, a double silicate of lime andalumina, is the imperishable cement of the ancients. But, on the other hand,Professor Carpenter asserts that the pyramids, with the exception of theirgranite casing, is formed of what \"geologists call nummulitic limestone. This isnewer than the old chalk, and is made of the shells of animals callednummulites--like little pieces of money about the size of a shilling.\" Howeverthis moot question may be decided, no one, from Herodotus and Pliny down to thelast wandering engineer who has gazed upon these imperial monuments oflong-crumbled dynasties, has been able to tell us how the gigantic masses weretransported and set up in place. Bunsen concedes to Egypt an antiquity of 20,000years. But even in this matter we would be left to conjecture if we dependedupon modern authorities. They can neither tell us for what the pyramids wereconstructed, under what dynasty the first was raised, nor the material of whichthey are built. All is conjecture with them. Professor Smyth has given us by far the most accurate mathematical descriptionof the great pyramid to be found in literature. But after showing theastronomical bearings of the structure, he so little appreciates ancientEgyptian thought that he actually maintains that the porphyry sarcophagus of theking's chamber is the unit of measure for the two most enlightened nations ofthe earth--\"England and America.\" One of the books of Hermes describes certainof the pyramids as standing upon the sea-shore, \"the waves of which dashed inpowerless fury against its base.\" This implies that the geographical features ofthe country have been changed, and may indicate that we must accord to theseancient \"granaries,\" \"magico-astrological observatories,\" and \"royalsepulchres,\" an origin antedating the upheaval of the Sahara and other deserts.This would imply rather more of an antiquity than the poor few thousands ofyears, so generously accorded to them by Egyptologists. Dr. Rebold, a French archeologist of some renown, gives his readers a glimpse ofthe culture which prevailed 5,000 (?) years B.C., by saying that there were atthat time no less than \"thirty or forty colleges of the priests who studiedoccult sciences and practical magic.\" A writer in the National Quarterly Review (Vol. xxxii., No. lxiii., December,1875) says that, \"The recent excavations made among the ruins of Carthage havebrought to light traces of a civilization, a refinement of art and luxury, whichmust even have outshone that of ancient Rome; and when the fiat went forth,Delenda est Carthago, the mistress of the world well knew that she was about todestroy a greater than herself, for, while one empire swayed the world by forceof arms alone, the other was the last and most perfect representative of a racewho had, for centuries before Rome was dreamed of, directed the civilization,the learning, and the intelligence of mankind.\" This Carthage is the one which,according to Appian, was standing as early as B.C. 1234, or fifty years beforethe taking of Troy, and not the one popularly supposed to have been built byDido (Elissa or Astarte) four centuries later. Here we have still another illustration of the truth of the doctrine of cycles.Draper's admissions as to the astronomical erudition of the ancient Egyptiansare singularly supported by an interesting fact quoted by Mr. J. M. Peebles,from a lecture delivered in Philadelphia, by the late Professor O. M. Mitchell,the astronomer. Upon the coffin of a mummy, now in the British Museum, wasdelineated the zodiac with the exact positions of the planets at the time of theautumnal equinox, in the year 1722 B.C. Professor Mitchell calculated the exactposition of the heavenly bodies belonging to our solar system at the timeindicated. \"The result,\" says Mr. Peebles, \"I give in his own words: 'To myastonishment . . . it was found that on the 7th of October, 1722 B.C., the moonand planets had occupied the exact points in the heavens marked upon the coffinin the British Museum.' \" * Professor John Fiske, in his onslaught on Dr. Draper's History of theIntellectual Development of Europe, sets his pen against the doctrine ofcyclical progression, remarking that \"we have never known the beginning or theend of an historic cycle, and have no inductive warrant for believing that weare now traversing one.\" **He chides the author of that eloquent and thoughtfulwork for the \"odd disposition exhibited throughout his work, not only to referthe best part of Greek culture to an Egyptian source, but uniformly to exalt thenon-European civilization at the expense of the European.\" We believe that this\"odd disposition\" might be directly sanctioned by the confessions of greatGrecian historians themselves. Professor Fiske might, with profit, readHerodotus over again. The \"Father of History\" confesses more than once thatGreece owes everything to Egypt. As to his assertion that the world has neverknown the beginning or the end of an historical cycle, we have but to cast aretrospective glance on the many glorious nations which have passed away, i.e.,reached the end of their great national cycle. Compare the Egypt of that day,with its perfection of art, science, and religion, its glorious cities andmonuments, and its swarming population, with the Egypt of to-day, peopled withstrangers; its ruins the abode of bats and snakes, and a few Copts the solesurviving heirs to all this grandeur--and see whether the cyclical theory doesnot reassert itself. Says Gliddon, who is now contradicted by Mr. Fiske:\"Philologists, astronomers, chemists, painters, architects, physicians, mustreturn to Egypt to learn the origin of language and writing; of the calendar andsolar motion; of the art of cutting granite with a copper chisel, and of givingelasticity to a copper sword; of making glass with the variegated hues of therainbow; of moving single blocks of polished syenite, nine hundred tons inweight, for any distance, by land and water; of building arches, rounded andpointed, with masonic precision unsurpassed at the present day, and antecedentby 2,000 years to the 'Cloaca Magna' of Rome; of sculpturing a Doric column1,000 years before the Dorians are known in history; of fresco painting inimperishable colors; of practical knowledge in anatomy; and of time-defyingpyramid-building.\" \"Every craftsman can behold, in Egyptian monuments, the progress of his art4,000 years ago; and whether it be a wheelwright building a chariot, a shoemakerdrawing his twine, a leather-cutter using the self-same form of knife of old asis considered the best form now, a weaver throwing the same hand-shuttle, awhitesmith using that identical form of blow-pipe but lately recognized to bethe most efficient, the seal-engraver cutting, in hieroglyphics, such names asSchooho's, above 4,300 years ago--all these, and many more astounding evidencesof Egyptian priority, now require but a glance at the plates of Rossellini.\" \"Truly,\" exclaims Mr. Peebles, \"these Ramsean temples and tombs were as much amarvel to the Grecian Herodotus as they are to us!\" * But, even then, the merciless hand of time had left its traces upon theirstructures, and some of them, whose very memory would be lost were it not forthe Books of Hermes, had been swept away into the oblivion of the ages. Kingafter king, and dynasty after dynasty had passed in a glittering pageant beforethe eyes of succeeding generations and their renown had filled the habitableglobe. The same pall of forgetfulness had fallen upon them and their monumentsalike, before the first of our historical authorities, Herodotus, preserved forposterity the remembrance of that wonder of the world, the great Labyrinth. Thelong-accepted Biblical chronology has so cramped the minds of not only theclergy, but even our scarce-unfettered scientists, that in treating ofprehistoric remains in different parts of the world, a constant fear ismanifested on their part to trespass beyond the period of 6,000 years, hithertoallowed by theology as the age of the world. Herodotus found the Labyrinth already in ruins; but nevertheless his admirationfor the genius of its builders knew no bounds. He regarded it as far moremarvellous than the pyramids themselves, and, as an eye-witness, minutelydescribes it. The French and Prussian savants, as well as other Egyptologists,agree as to the emplacement, and identified its noble ruins. Moreover, theyconfirm the account given of it by the old historian. Herodotus says that hefound therein 3,000 chambers; half subterranean and the other half above-ground.\"The upper chambers,\" he says, \"I myself passed through and examined in detail.In the underground ones (which may exist till now, for all the archaeologistsknow), the keepers of the building would not let me in, for they contain thesepulchres of the kings who built the Labyrinth, and also those of the sacredcrocodiles. The upper chambers I saw and examined with my own eyes, and foundthem to excel all other human productions.\" In Rawlinson's translation,Herodotus is made to say: \"The passages through the houses and the variedwindings of the paths across the courts, excited in me infinite admiration as Ipassed from the courts into the chambers, and from thence into colonnades, andfrom colonnades into other houses, and again into courts unseen before. The roofwas throughout of stone like the walls, and both were exquisitely carved allover with figures. Every court was surrounded with a colonnade, which was builtof white stones, sculptured most exquisitely. At the corner of the Labyrinthstands a pyramid forty fathoms high, with large figures engraved on it, and itis entered by a vast subterranean passage.\" If such was the Labyrinth, when viewed by Herodotus, what, in such a case, wasancient Thebes, the city destroyed far earlier than the period of Psammeticus,who himself reigned 530 years after the destruction of Troy? We find that in histime Memphis was the capital, while of the glorious Thebes there remained butruins. Now, if we, who are enabled to form our estimate only by the ruins ofwhat was already ruins so many ages before our era--are stupefied in theircontemplation, what must have been the general aspect of Thebes in the days ofits glory? Karnak--temple, palace, ruins, or whatsoever the archaeologists mayterm it--is now its only representative. But solitary and alone as it stands,fit emblem of majestic empire, as if forgotten by time in the onward march ofthe centuries, it testifies to the art and skill of the ancients. He must beindeed devoid of the spiritual perception of genius, who fails to feel as wellas to see the intellectual grandeur of the race that planned and built it. Champollion, who passed almost his entire life in the exploration ofarchaeological remains, gives vent to his emotions in the following descriptionsof Karnak: \"The ground covered by the mass of remaining buildings is square; andeach side measures 1,800 feet. One is astounded and overcome by the grandeur ofthe sublime remnants, the prodigality and magnificence of workmanship to be seeneverywhere.\" \"No people of ancient or modern times has conceived the art ofarchitecture upon a scale so sublime, so grandiose as it existed among theancient Egyptians; and the imagination, which in Europe soars far above ourporticos, arrests itself and falls powerless at the foot of the hundred andforty columns of the hypostyle of Karnak! In one of its halls, the Cathedral ofNotre Dame might stand and not touch the ceiling, but be considered as a smallornament in the centre of the hall.\" A writer in a number of an English periodical, of 1870, evidently speaking withthe authority of a traveller who describes what he has seen, expresses himselfas follows: \"Courts, halls, gateways, pillars, obelisks, monolithic figures,sculptures, long rows of sphinxes, are found in such profusion at Karnak, thatthe sight is too much for modem comprehension.\" Says Denon, the French traveller: \"It is hardly possible to believe, afterseeing it, in the reality of the existence of so many buildings collectedtogether on a single point, in their dimensions, in the resolute perseverancewhich their construction required, and in the incalculable expenses of so muchmagnificence! It is necessary that the reader should fancy what is before him tobe a dream, as he who views the objects themselves occasionally yields to thedoubt whether he be perfectly awake. . . . There are lakes and mountains withinthe periphery of the sanctuary. These two edifices are selected as examples froma list next to inexhaustible. The whole valley and delta of the Nile, from thecataracts to the sea, was covered with temples, palaces, tombs, pyramids,obelisks, and pillars. The execution of the sculptures is beyond praise. Themechanical perfection with which artists wrought in granite, serpentine,breccia, and basalt, is wonderful, according to all the experts . . . animalsand plants look as good as natural, and artificial objects are beautifullysculptured; battles by sea and land, and scenes of domestic life are to be foundin all their bas-reliefs.\" \"The monuments,\" says an English author, \"which there strike the traveller, fillhis mind with great ideas. At the sight of the colossuses and superb obelisks,which seem to surpass the limits of human nature, he cannot help exclaiming,'This was the work of man,' and this sentiment seems to ennoble hisexistence.\" * In his turn, Dr. Richardson, speaking of the Temple of Dendera, says: \"Thefemale figures are so extremely well executed, that they do all but speak; theyhave a mildness of feature and expression that never was surpassed.\" Every one of these stones is covered with hieroglyphics, and the more ancientthey are, the more beautifully we find them chiselled. Does not this furnish anew proof that history got its first glimpse of the ancients when the arts werealready fast degenerating among them? The obelisks have their inscriptions cuttwo inches, and sometimes more, in depth, and they are cut with the highestdegree of perfection. Some idea may be formed of their depth, from the fact thatthe Arabs, for a small fee, will climb sometimes to the very top of an obelisk,by inserting their toes and fingers in the excavations of the hieroglyphics.That all of these works, in which solidity rivals the beauty of their execution,were done before the days of the Exodus, there remains no historical doubtwhatever. (All the archaeologists now agree in saying that, the further back wego in history, the better and finer become these arts.) These views clash againwith the individual opinion of Mr. Fiske, who would have us believe that \"thesculptures upon these monuments (of Egypt, Hindustan, and Assyria), moreover,betoken a very undeveloped condition of the artistic faculties.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_726] Nay, the learned gentlemangoes farther. Joining his voice in the opposition against the claims oflearning--which belongs by right to the sacerdotal castes of antiquity--to thatof Lewis, he contemptuously remarks that \"the extravagant theory of a profoundscience possessed by the Egyptian priesthood from a remote antiquity, andimparted to itinerant Greek philosophers, has been utterly destroyed (?) by SirG. C. Lewis ** . . . while, with regard to Egypt and Hindustan, as well asAssyria, it may be said that the colossal monuments which have adorned thesecountries since prehistoric times, bear witness to the former prevalence of abarbaric despotism, totally incompatible with social nobility, and, therefore,with well-sustained progress.\" *** A curious argument, indeed. If the size and grandeur of public monuments are toserve to our posterity as a standard by which to approximately estimate the\"progress of civilization\" attained by their builders, it may be prudent,perhaps, for America, so proud of her alleged progress and freedom, to dwarf herbuildings at once to one story. Otherwise, according to Professor Fiske'stheory, the archaeologists of A.D. 3877 will be applying to the \"AncientAmerica\" of 1877, the rule of Lewis--and say the ancient United States \"may beconsidered as a great latifundium, or plantation, cultivated by the entirepopulation, as the king's (president's) slaves.\" Is it because the white-skinnedAryan races were never born \"builders,\" like the Eastern AEthiopians, ordark-skinned Caucasians, **** and, therefore, never able to compete with thelatter in such colossal structures, that we must jump at the conclusion thatthese grandiose temples and pyramids could only have been erected under the whipof a merciless despot? Strange logic! It would really seem more prudent to holdto the \"rigorous canons of criticism\" laid down by Lewis and Grote, and honestlyconfess at once, that we really know little about these ancient nations, andthat, except so far as purely hypothetical speculations go, unless we study inthe same direction as the ancient priests did, we have as little chance in thefuture. We only know what they allowed the uninitiated to know, but the littlewe do learn of them by deduction, ought to be sufficient to assure us that, evenin the nineteenth century, with all our claims to supremacy in arts andsciences, we are totally unable, we will not say to build anything like themonuments of Egypt, Hindustan, or Assyria, but even to rediscover the least ofthe ancient \"lost arts.\" Besides, Sir Gardner Wilkinson gives forcibleexpression to this view of the exhumed treasures of old, by adding that, \"he cantrace no primitive mode of life, no barbarous customs, but a sort of stationarycivilization from the most remote periods.\" Thus far, archaeology disagrees withgeology, which affirms that the further they trace the remains of men, the morebarbarous they find them. It is doubtful if geology has even yet exhausted thefield of research afforded her in the caves, and the views of geologists, whichare based upon present experience, may be radically modified, when they come todiscover the remains of the ancestors of the people whom they now style thecave-dwellers. What better illustrates the theory of cycles than the following fact? Nearly 700years B.C., in the schools of Thales and Pythagoras was taught the doctrine ofthe true motion of the earth, its form, and the whole heliocentric system. Andin 317 A.D., we find Lactantius, the preceptor of Crispus Caesar, son ofConstantine the Great, teaching his pupil that the earth was a plane surroundedby the sky, which is composed of fire and water, and warning him against theheretical doctrine of the earth's globular form! Whenever, in the pride of some new discovery, we throw a look into the past, wefind, to our dismay, certain vestiges which indicate the possibility, if notcertainty, that the alleged discovery was not totally unknown to the ancients. It is generally asserted that neither the early inhabitants of the Mosaic times,nor even the more civilized nations of the Ptolemaic period were acquainted withelectricity. If we remain undisturbed in this opinion, it is not for lack ofproofs to the contrary. We may disdain to search for a profounder meaning insome characteristic sentences of Servius, and other writers; we cannot soobliterate them but that, at some future day, that meaning will appear to us inall its significant truths. \"The first inhabitants of the earth,\" says he,\"never carried fire to their altars, but by their prayers they brought down theheavenly fire.\" *\"Prometheus discovered and revealed to man the art of bringingdown lightning; and by the method which he taught to them, they brought downfire from the region above.\" If, after pondering these words, we are still willing to attribute them to thephraseology of mythological fables, we may turn to the days of Numa, theking-philosopher, so renowned for his esoteric learning, and find ourselves moreembarrassed to deal with his case. We can neither accuse him of ignorance,superstition, nor credulity; for, if history can be believed at all, he wasintently bent on destroying polytheism and idol-worship. He had so welldissuaded the Romans from idolatry that for nearly two centuries neither statuesnor images appeared in their temples. On the other hand old historians tell usthat the knowledge which Numa possessed in natural physics was remarkable.Tradition says that he was initiated by the priests of the Etruscan divinities,and instructed by them in the secret of forcing Jupiter, the Thunderer, todescend upon earth. * Ovid shows that Jupiter Elicius began to be worshipped bythe Romans from that time. Salverte is of the opinion that before Franklindiscovered his refined electricity, Numa had experimented with it mostsuccessfully, and that Tullus Hostilius was the first victim of the dangerous\"heavenly guest\" recorded in history. Titus Livy and Pliny narrate that thisprince, having found in the Books of Numa, instructions on the secret sacrificesoffered to Jupiter Elicius, made a mistake, and, in consequence of it, \"he wasstruck by lightning and consumed in his own palace.\" ** Salverte remarks that Pliny, in the exposition of Numa's scientific secrets,\"makes use of expressions which seem to indicate two distinct processes\"; theone obtained thunder (impetrare), the other forced it to lightning (cogere). ***\"Guided by Numa's book,\" says Lucius, quoted by Pliny, \"Tullus undertook toinvoke the aid of Jupiter. . . . But having performed the rite imperfectly, heperished, struck by thunder.\" **** Tracing back the knowledge of thunder andlightning possessed by the Etruscan priests, we find that Tarchon, the founderof the theurgism of the former, desiring to preserve his house from lightning,surrounded it by a hedge of the white bryony, ***** a climbing plant which hasthe property of averting thunderbolts. Tarchon the theurgist was much anteriorto the siege of Troy. The pointed metallic lightning-rod, for which we areseemingly indebted to Franklin, is probably a rediscovery after all. There aremany medals which seem to strongly indicate that the principle was ancientlyknown. The temple of Juno had its roof covered with a quantity of pointed bladesof swords. ****** If we possess but little proof of the ancients having had any clear notions asto all the effects of electricity, there is very strong evidence, at all events,of their having been perfectly acquainted with electricity itself. \"Ben David,\"says the author of The Occult Sciences, \"has asserted that Moses possessed someknowledge of the phenomena of electricity.\" Professor Hirt, of Berlin, is ofthis opinion. Michaelis, remarks--firstly: \"that there is no indication thatlightning ever struck the temple of Jerusalem, during a thousand years.Secondly, that according to Josephus, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_737] a forest of points . . .of gold, and very sharp, covered the roof of the temple. Thirdly, that this roofcommunicated with the caverns in the hill upon which the temple was situated, bymeans of pipes in connection with the gilding which covered all the exterior ofthe building; in consequence of which the points would act as conductors.\" ** Ammianus Marcellinus, a famous historian of the fourth century, a writergenerally esteemed for the fairness and correctness of his statements, tellsthat \"The magi, preserved perpetually in their furnaces fire that theymiraculously got from heaven.\" *** There is a sentence in the Hindu Oupnek-hat,which runs thus: \"To know fire, the sun, the moon, and lightning, isthree-fourths of the science of God.\" **** Finally, Salverte shows that in the days of Ktesias, \"India was acquainted withthe use of conductors of lightning.\" This historian plainly states that \"ironplaced at the bottom of a fountain . . . and made in the form of a sword, withthe point upward, possessed, as soon as it was thus fixed in the ground, theproperty of averting storms and lightnings.\" ***** What can be plainer? Some modern writers deny the fact that a great mirror was placed in thelight-house of the Alexandrian port, for the purpose of discovering vessels at adistance at sea. But the renowned Buffon believed in it; for he honestlyconfesses that \"If the mirror really existed, as I firmly believe it did, to theancients belong the honor of the invention of the telescope.\" ****** Stevens, in his work on the East, asserts that he found railroads in Upper Egyptwhose grooves were coated with iron. Canova, Powers, and other celebratedsculptors of our modern age deem it an honor to be compared with Pheidias ofold, and strict truth would, perhaps, hesitate at such a flattery. Professor Jowett discredits the story of the Atlantis, in the Timaeus; and therecords of 8,000 and 9,000 years appear to him an ancient swindle. But Bunsenremarks: \"There is nothing improbable in itself in reminiscences and records ofgreat events in Egypt 9,000 years B.C., for . . . the Origines of Egypt go backto the ninth millennium before Christ.\" *Then how about the primitive Cyclopeanfortresses of ancient Greece? Can the walls of Tiryns, about which, according toarchaeological accounts, \"even among the ancients it was reported to have beenthe work of the Cyclops,\" **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_744] be deemed posterior to thepyramids? Masses of rock, some equal to a cube of six feet, and the smallest ofwhich, Pausanias says, could never be moved by a yoke of oxen, laid up in wallsof solid masonry twenty-five feet thick and over forty feet high, still believedto be the work of men of the races known to our history! Wilkinson's researches have brought to light the fact that many inventions ofwhat we term modern, and upon which we plume ourselves, were perfected by theancient Egyptians. The newly-discovered papyrus of Ebers, the Germanarchaeologist, proves that neither our modern chignons, skin-beautifying pearlpowders, nor eaux dentifrices were secrets to them. More than one modernphysician--even among those who advertise themselves as having \"made aspeciality of nervous disorders\"--may find his advantage in consulting theMedical Books of Hermes, which contain prescriptions of real therapeutic value. The Egyptians, as we have seen, excelled in all arts. They made paper soexcellent in quality as to be time-proof. \"They took out the pith of thepapyrus,\" says our anonymous writer, previously mentioned, \"dissected and openedthe fibre, and flattening it by a process known to them, made it as thin as ourfoolscap paper, but far more durable. . . . They sometimes cut it into stripsand glued it together; many of such written documents are yet in existence.\" Thepapyrus found in the tomb of the queen's mummy, and another one found in thesarcophagus of the \"Chambre de la Reine,\" at Ghizeh, present the appearance ofthe finest glossy white muslin, while it possesses the durability of the bestcalf-parchment. \"For a long time the savants believed the papyrus to have beenintroduced by Alexander the Great--as they erroneously imagined a good many morethings--but Lepsius found rolls of papyri in tombs and monuments of the twelfthdynasty; sculptured pictures of papyri were found later, on monuments of thefourth dynasty, and now it is proved that the art of writing was known and usedas early as the days of Menes, the protomonarch\"; and thus it was finallydiscovered that the art and their system of writing were perfect and completefrom the very first. It is to Champollion that we owe the first interpretation of their weirdwriting; and, but for his life-long labor, we would till now remain uninformedas to the meaning of all these pictured letters, and the ancients would still beconsidered ignorant by the moderns whom they so greatly excelled in some artsand sciences. \"He was the first to find out what wondrous tale the Egyptians hadto tell, for one who could read their endless manuscripts and records. They leftthem on every spot and object capable of receiving characters. . . . Theyengraved, and chiselled, and sculptured them on monuments; they traced them onfurniture, rocks, stones, walls, coffins, and tombs, as on the papyrus. . . .The pictures of their daily lives, in their smallest details, are being nowunravelled before our dazzled eyes in the most wondrous way. . . . Nothing, ofwhat we know, seems to have been overlooked by the ancient Egyptians. . . . Thehistory of 'Sesostris' shows us how well he and his people were versed in theart and practice of war. . . . The pictures show how formidable they were whenencountered in battle. They constructed war-engines. . . . Horner says thatthrough each of the 100 gates of Thebes issued 200 men with horses and chariots;the latter were magnificently constructed, and very light in comparison with ourmodern heavy, clumsy, and uncomfortable artillery wagons.\" Kenrick describesthem in the following terms: \"In short, as all the essential principles whichregulate the construction and draught of carriages are exemplified in thewar-chariots of the Pharaohs, so there is nothing which modern taste and luxuryhave devised for their decoration to which we do not find a prototype in themonuments of the eighteenth dynasty.\" Springs--metallic springs--have been foundin them, and, notwithstanding Wilkinson's superficial investigation in thatdirection, and description of these in his studies, we find proofs that suchwere used to prevent the jolting in the chariots in their too rapid course. Thebas-reliefs show us certain melees and battles in which we can find and tracetheir uses and customs to the smallest details. The heavily-armed men fought incoats of mail, the infantry had quilted tunics and felt helmets, with metalliccoverings to protect them the better. Muratori, the modern Italian inventor who,some ten years ago, introduced his \"impenetrable cuirasse,\" has but followed inhis invention what he could make out of the ancient method which suggested tohim the idea. The process of rendering such objects as card-board, felt, andother tissues, impenetrable to the cuts and thrusts of any sharp weapon, is nownumbered among the lost arts. Muratori succeeded but imperfectly in preparingsuch felt cuirasses, and, notwithstanding the boasted achievements of modernchemistry he could derive from it no preparation adequate to effect his object,and failed. To what perfection chemistry had reached in ancient times, may be inferred froma fact mentioned by Virey. In his dissertations, he shows that Asclepiadotus, ageneral of Mithradates, reproduced chemically the deleterious exhalations of thesacred grotto. These vapors, like those of Curnae, threw the Pythoness into themantic frenzy. Egyptians used bows, double-edged swords and daggers, javelins, spears, andpikes. The light troops were armed with darts and slings; charioteers wieldedmaces and battle-axes; in siege-operations they were perfect. \"The assailants,\"says the anonymous writer, \"advanced, forming a narrow and long line, the pointbeing protected by a triple-sided, impenetrable engine pushed before them on akind of roller, by an invisible squad of men. They had covered undergroundpassages with trap-doors, scaling ladders, and the art of escalade and militarystrategy was carried by them to perfection. . . . The battering ram was familiarto them as other things; being such experts in quarrying they knew how to set amine to a wall and bring it down.\" The same writer remarks, that it is a greatdeal safer for us to mention what the Egyptians did than what they did not know,for every day brings some new discovery of their wonderful knowledge; \"and if,\"he adds, \"we were to find out that they used Armstrong guns, this fact would notbe much more astonishing than many of the facts brought out to light already.\" The proof that they were proficient in mathematical sciences, lies in the factthat those ancient mathematicians whom we honor as the fathers of geometry wentto Egypt to be instructed. Says Professor Smyth, as quoted by Mr. Peebles, \"thegeometrical knowledge of the pyramid-builders began where Euclid's ended.\"Before Greece came into existence, the arts, with the Egyptians, were ripe andold. Land-measuring, an art resting on geometry, the Egyptians certainly knewwell, as, according to the Bible, Joshua, after conquering the Holy Land, hadskill enough to divide it. And how could a people so skilled in naturalphilosophy as the Egyptians were, not be proportionately skilled in psychologyand spiritual philosophy? The temple was the nursery of the highestcivilization, and it alone possessed that higher knowledge of magic which was initself the quintessence of natural philosophy. The occult powers of nature weretaught in the greatest secrecy and the most wonderful cures were performedduring the performing of the Mysteries. Herodotus acknowledges * that the Greekslearned all they knew, including the sacred services of the temple, from theEgyptians, and because of that, their principal temples were consecrated toEgyptian divinities. Melampus, the famous healer and soothsayer of Argos, had touse his medicines \"after the manner of the Egyptians,\" from whom he had gainedhis knowledge, whenever he desired his cure to be thoroughly effective. Hehealed Iphiclus of his impotency and debility by the rust of iron, according tothe directions of Mantis, his magnetic sleeper, or oracle. Sprengel gives manywonderful instances of such magical cures in his History of Medicine (see p.119). Diodorus, in his work on the Egyptians (lib. i.), says that Isis has deservedimmortality, for all nations of the earth bear witness to the power of thisgoddess to cure diseases by her influence. \"This is proved,\" he says, \"not byfable as among the Greeks, but by authentic facts.\" Galen records severalremedial means which were preserved in the healing wards of the temples. Hementions also a universal medicine which in his time was called Isis. * The doctrines of several Greek philosophers, who had been instructed in Egypt,demonstrates their profound learning. Orpheus, who, according to Artapanus, wasa disciple of Moyses (Moses), ** Pythagoras, Herodotus, and Plato owe theirphilosophy to the same temples in which the wise Solon was instructed by thepriests. \"Antiklides relates,\" says Pliny, \"that the letters were invented inEgypt by a person whose name was Menon, fifteen years before Phoroneus the mostancient king of Greece.\" ***Jablonski proves that the heliocentric system, aswell as the earth's sphericity, were known by the priests of Egypt fromimmemorial ages. \"This theory,\" he adds, \"Pythagoras took from the Egyptians,who had it from the Brachmans of India.\" ****Fenelon, the illustrious Archbishopof Cambray, in his Lives of the Ancient Philosophers, credits Pythagoras withthis knowledge, and says that besides teaching his disciples that as the earthwas round there were antipodes, since it was inhabited everywhere, the greatmathematician was the first to discover that the morning and evening star wasthe same. If we now consider that Pythagoras lived in about the 16th Olympiad,over 700 years B.C., and taught this fact at such an early period, we mustbelieve that it was known by others before him. The works of Aristotle,Laertius, and several others in which Pythagoras is mentioned, demonstrate thathe had learned from the Egyptians about the obliquity of the ecliptic, thestarry composition of the milky way, and the borrowed light of the moon. Wilkinson, corroborated later by others, says that the Egyptians divided time,knew the true length of the year, and the precession of the equinoxes. Byrecording the rising and setting of the stars, they understood the particularinfluences which proceed from the positions and conjunctions of all heavenlybodies, and therefore their priests, prophesying as accurately as our modernastronomers, meteorological changes, could, en plus, astrologize through astralmotions. Though the sober and eloquent Cicero may be partially right in hisindignation against the exaggerations of the Babylonian priests, who \"assertthat they have preserved upon monuments observations extending back during aninterval of 470,000 years,\" * still, the period at which astronomy had arrivedat its perfection with the ancients is beyond the reach of modern calculation. A writer in one of our scientific journals observes \"that every science in itsgrowth passes through three stages: First, we have the stage of observation,when facts are collected and registered by many minds in many places. Next, wehave the stage of generalization, when these carefully verified facts arearranged methodically, generalized systematically, and classified logically, soas to deduce and elucidate from them the laws that regulate their rule andorder. Lastly, we have the stage of prophecy, when these laws are so appliedthat events can be predicted to occur with unerring accuracy.\" If severalthousand years B.C., Chinese and Chaldean astronomers predicted eclipses--thelatter, whether by the cycle of Saros, or other means, matters not--the factremains the same. They had reached the last and highest stage of astronomicalscience--they prophesied. If they could, in the year 1722 B.C., delineate thezodiac with the exact positions of the planets at the time of the autumnalequinox, and so unerringly as Professor Mitchell, the astronomer, proved, thenthey knew the laws that regulate \"carefully-verified facts\" to perfection, andapplied them with as much certainty as our modern astronomers. Moreover,astronomy is said to be in our century \"the only science which has thoroughlyreached the last stage . . . other sciences are yet in various stages of growth;electricity, in some branches, has reached the third stage, but in many branchesis still in its infantine period.\" ** This we know, on the exasperatingconfessions of men of science themselves, and we can entertain no doubt as tothis sad reality in the nineteenth century, as we belong ourselves to it. Not soin relation to the men who lived in the days of the glory of Chaldaea, Assyria,and Babylon. Of the stages they reached in other sciences we know nothing,except that in astronomy they stood equal with us, for they had also reached thethird and last stage. In his lecture on the Lost Arts, Wendell Phillips veryartistically describes the situation. \"We seem to imagine,\" says he, \"thatwhether knowledge will die with us or not, it certainly began with us. . . . Wehave a pitying estimate, a tender pity for the narrowness, ignorance, anddarkness of the bygone ages.\" To illustrate our own idea with the closingsentence of the favorite lecturer, we may as well confess that we undertook thischapter, which in one sense interrupts our narrative, to inquire of our men ofscience, whether they are sure that they are boasting \"on the right line.\" Thus we read of a people, who, according to some learned writers, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_752] had just emerged from thebronze age into the succeeding age of iron. \"If Chaldea, Assyria, and Babylonpresented stupendous and venerable antiquities reaching far back into the nightof time, Persia was not without her wonders of a later date. The pillared hallsof Persepolis were filled with miracles of art--carvings, sculptures, enamels,alabaster libraries, obelisks, sphinxes, colossal bulls. Ecbatana, in Media, thecool summer retreat of the Persian kings, was defended by seven encircling wallsof hewn and polished blocks, the interior ones in succession of increasingheight, and of different colors, in astrological accordance with the sevenplanets. The palace was roofed with silver tiles; its beams were plated withgold. At midnight, in its halls, the sun was rivalled by many a row of naphthacressets. A paradise, that luxury of the monarchs of the East, was planted inthe midst of the city. The Persian empire was truly the garden of the world. . .. In Babylon there still remained its walls, once more than sixty miles incompass and, after the ravages of three centuries and three conquerors, stillmore than eighty feet in height; there were still the ruins of the temple of thecloud-encompassed Bel; on its top was planted the observatory wherein the weirdChaldean astronomers had held nocturnal communion with the stars; still therewere vestiges of the two palaces with their hanging gardens, in which were treesgrowing in mid-air, and the wreck of the hydraulic machinery that had suppliedthem from the river. Into the artificial lake, with its vast apparatus ofaqueducts and sluices, the melted snows of the Armenian mountains found theirway and were confined in their course through the city by the embankments of theEuphrates. Most wonderful of all, perhaps, was the tunnel under theriver-bed.\" ** In his First Traces of Man in Europe, Albrecht Muller proposes a namedescriptive of the age in which we live, and suggests that \"the age of paper\" isperhaps as good as any that can be discussed. We do not agree with the learnedprofessor. Our firm opinion is, that succeeding generations will term ours, atbest, the age of brass; at worst, that of albata or of oroide. The thought of the present-day commentator and critic as to the ancientlearning, is limited to and runs round the exoterism of the temples; his insightis either unwilling or unable to penetrate into the solemn adyta of old, wherethe hierophant instructed the neophyte to regard the public worship in its truelight. No ancient sage would have taught that man is the king of creation, andthat the starry heaven and our mother earth were created for his sake. He, whodoubts the assertion, may turn to the Magical and Philosophical Precepts ofZoroaster, and find its corroboration in the following: * \"Direct not thy mind to the vast measures of the earth;For the plant of truth is not upon ground.Nor measure the measures of the sun, collecting rules,For he is carried by the eternal will of the Father, not for your sake,Dismiss the impetuous course of the moon;For she runs always by work of necessity.The progression of the stars was not generated for your sake.\"A rather strange teaching to come from those who are universally believed tohave worshipped the sun, and moon, and the starry host, as gods. The sublimeprofundity of the Magian precepts being beyond the reach of modern materialisticthought, the Chaldean philosophers are accused, together with the ignorantmasses, of Sabianism and sun-worship. There was a vast difference between the true worship taught to those who showedthemselves worthy, and the state religions. The magians are accused of all kindsof superstition, but this is what a Chaldean Oracle says: \"The wide aerial flight of birds is not true,Nor the dissections of the entrails of victims; they are all mere toys,The basis of mercenary fraud; flee from theseIf you would open the sacred paradise of pietyWhere virtue, wisdom, and equity, are assembled.\" **Surely, it is not those who warn people against \"mercenary fraud\" who can beaccused of it; and if they accomplished acts which seem miraculous, who can withfairness presume to deny that it was done merely because they possessed aknowledge of natural philosophy and psychological science to a degree unknown toour schools? What did they not know? It is a well-demonstrated fact that the true meridianwas correctly ascertained before the first pyramid was built. They had clocksand dials to measure time; their cubit was the established unit of linearmeasure, being 1,707 feet of English measure; according to Herodotus the unit ofweight was also known; as money, they had gold and silver rings valued byweight; they had the decimal and duodecimal modes of calculation from theearliest times, and were proficient in algebra. \"How could they otherwise,\" saysan unknown author, \"bring into operation such immense mechanical powers, if theyhad not thoroughly understood the philosophy of what we term the mechanicalpowers?\" The art of making linen and fine fabrics is also proved to have been one oftheir branches of knowledge, for the Bible speaks of it. Joseph was presented byPharaoh with a vesture of fine linen, a golden chain, and many more things. Thelinen of Egypt was famous throughout the world. The mummies are all wrapped init and the linen is beautifully preserved. Pliny speaks of a certain garmentsent 600 years B.C., by King Amasis to Lindus, every single thread of which wascomposed of 360 minor threads twisted together. Herodotus gives us (book i.), inhis account of Isis and the Mysteries performed in her honor, an idea of thebeauty and \"admirable softness of the linen worn by the priests.\" The latterwore shoes made of papyrus and garments of fine linen, because this goddessfirst taught the use of it; and thus, besides being called Isiaci, or priests ofIsis, they were also known as Linigera, or the \"linen-wearing.\" This linen wasspun and dyed in those brilliant and gorgeous colors, the secret of which islikewise now among the lost arts. On the mummies we often find the mostbeautiful embroidery and bead-work ornamenting their shirts; several of such canbe seen in the museum of Bulak (Cairo), and are unsurpassable in beauty; thedesigns are exquisite, and the labor seems immense. The elaborate and so muchvaunted Gobelins tapestry, is but a gross production when compared with some ofthe embroidery of the ancient Egyptians. We have but to refer to Exodus todiscover how skilful was the workmanship of the Israelitish pupils of theEgyptians upon their tabernacle and sacred ark. The sacerdotal vestments, withtheir decorations of \"pomegranates and golden bells,\" and the thummim, orjewelled breastplate of the high priest, are described by Josephus as being ofunparalleled beauty and of wonderful workmanship; and yet we find beyond doubtthat the Jews adopted their rites and ceremonies, and even the special dress oftheir Levites, from the Egyptians. Clemens Alexandrinus acknowledges it veryreluctantly, and so does Origen and other Fathers of the Church, some of whom,as a matter of course, attribute the coincidence to a clever trick of Satan inanticipation of events. Proctor, the astronomer, says in one of his books, \"Theremarkable breastplate worn by the Jewish high priest was derived directly fromthe Egyptians.\" The word thummim itself is evidently of Egyptian origin,borrowed by Moses, like the rest; for further on the same page, Mr. Proctor saysthat, \"In the often-repeated picture of judgment the deceased Egyptian is seenconducted by the god Horus (?), while Anubis places on one of the balances avase supposed to contain his good actions, and in the other is the emblem oftruth, a representation of Thmei, the goddess of truth, which was also worn onthe judicial breastplate.\" Wilkinson, in his Manners and Customs of the AncientEgyptians, shows that the Hebrew thummim is a plural form of the word Thmei.\" * All the ornamental arts seem to have been known to the Egyptians. Their jewelryof gold, silver, and precious stones are beautifully wrought; so was thecutting, polishing, and setting of them executed by their lapidaries in thefinest style. The finger-ring of an Egyptian mummy--if we remember aright--waspronounced the most artistic piece of jewelry in the London Exhibition of 1851.Their imitation of precious stones in glass is far above anything done at thepresent day; and the emerald may be said to have been imitated to perfection. In Pompeii, says Wendell Phillips, they discovered a room full of glass; therewas ground-glass, window-glass, cut-glass, and colored-glass of every variety.Catholic priests who broke into China 200 years ago, were shown a glass,transparent and colorless, which was filled with liquor made by the Chinese, andwhich appeared to be colorless like water. \"This liquor was poured into theglass, and then looking through, it seemed to be filled with fishes. They turnedit out and repeated the experiment and again it was filled with fishes.\" In Romethey show a bit of glass, a transparent glass, which they light up so as to showyou that there is nothing concealed, but in the centre of the glass is a drop ofcolored glass, perhaps as large as a pea, mottled like a duck, and which even aminiature pencil could not do more perfectly. \"It is manifest that this drop ofliquid glass must have been poured, because there is no joint. This must havebeen done by a greater heat than the annealing process, because that processshows breaks.\" In relation to their wonderful art of imitating precious stones,the lecturer speaks of the \"celebrated vase of the Genoa Cathedral,\" which wasconsidered for long centuries \"a solid emerald.\" \"The Roman Catholic legend ofit was that it was one of the treasures that the Queen of Sheba gave to Solomon,and that it was the identical cup out of which the Saviour drank at the LastSupper.\" Subsequently it was found not to be an emerald, but an imitation; andwhen Napoleon brought it to Paris and gave it to the Institute, the scientistswere obliged to confess that it was not a stone, and that they could not tellwhat it was. Further, speaking of the skill of the ancients in metal works, the same lecturernarrates that \"when the English plundered the Summer Palace of the Emperor ofChina, the European artists were surprised at seeing the curiously-wrought metalvessels of every kind, far exceeding all the boasted skill of the workmen ofEurope.\" African tribes in the interior of the country gave travellers betterrazors than they had. \"George Thompson told me,\" he adds, \"he saw a man inCalcutta throw a handful of floss silk into the air, and a Hindu sever it intopieces with his sabre of native steel.\" He concludes by the apt remark that \"thesteel is the greatest triumph of metallurgy, and metallurgy is the glory ofchemistry.\" So with the ancient Egyptians and Semitic races. They dug gold andseparated it with the utmost skill. Copper, lead, and iron were found inabundance near the Red Sea. In a lecture delivered in 1873, on the Cave-Men of Devonshire, Mr. W. Pengelly,F.R.S., stated on the authority of some Egyptologists that the first iron usedin Egypt was meteoric iron, as the earliest mention of this metal is found in anEgyptian document, in which it is called the \"stone from heaven.\" This wouldimply the idea that the only iron which was in use in days of old was meteorite.This may have been the case at the commencement of the period embraced in ourpresent geological explorations, but till we can compute with at leastapproximate accuracy the age of our excavated relics, who can tell but that weare making a blunder of possibly several hundred thousand years? Theinjudiciousness of dogmatizing upon what the ancient Chaldeans and Egyptians didnot know about mining and metallurgy is at least partially shown by thediscoveries of Colonel Howard Vyse. Moreover, many of such precious stones asare only found at a great depth in mines are mentioned in Homer and the HebrewScriptures. Have scientists ascertained the precise time when mining-shafts werefirst sunk by mankind? According to Dr. A. C. Hamlin, in India, the arts of thegoldsmith and lapidary have been practiced from an \"unknown antiquity.\" That theEgyptians either knew from the remotest ages how to temper steel, or possessedsomething still better and more perfect than the implement necessary in our daysfor chiselling, is an alternative from which the archeologists cannot escape.How else could they have produced such artistic chiselling, or wrought suchsculpture as they did? The critics may take their choice of either; according tothem, steel tools of the most exquisite temper, or some other means of cuttingsienite, granite, and basalt; which, in the latter case, must be added to thelong catalogue of lost arts. Professor Albrecht Muller says: \"We may ascribe the introduction of bronzemanufacture into Europe to a great race immigrant from Asia some 6,000 yearsago, called Aryas or Aryans. . . . Civilization of the East preceded that of theWest by many centuries. . . . There are many proofs that a considerable degreeof culture existed at its very beginning. Bronze was yet in use, but iron aswell. Pottery was not only shaped on the lathe, but burned a good red.Manufactures in glass, gold, and silver, are found for the first time. In lonelymountain places are yet found dross, and the remains of iron-furnaces. . . . Tobe sure, this dross is sometimes ascribed to volcanic action, but it is met withwhere volcanoes never could have existed.\" But it is in the process of preparing mummies that the skill of this wonderfulpeople is exemplified in the highest degree. None but those who have madespecial study of the subject, can estimate the amount of skill, patience, andknowledge exacted for the accomplishment of this indestructible work, whichoccupied several months. Both chemistry and surgery were called intorequisition. The mummies, if left in the dry climate of Egypt, seem to bepracticably imperishable; and even when removed after a repose of severalthousand years, show no signs of change. \"The body,\" says the anonymous writer,\"was filled with myrrh, cassia, and other gums, and after that, saturated withnatron. . . . Then followed the marvellous swathing of the embalmed body, soartistically executed, that professional modern bandagists are lost inadmiration at its excellency.\" Says Dr. Grandville: \" . . . there is not asingle form of bandage known to modern surgery, of which far better and clevererexamples are not seen in the swathings of the Egyptian mummies. The strips oflinen are found without one single joint, extending to 1,000 yards in length.\"Rossellini, in Kenrick's Ancient Egypt, gives a similar testimony to thewonderful variety and skill with which the bandages have been applied andinterlaced. There was not a fracture in the human body that could not berepaired successfully by the sacerdotal physician of those remote days. Who but well remembers the excitement produced some twenty-five years ago by thediscovery of anaesthesia? The nitrous oxide gas, sulphuric and chloric ether,chloroform, \"laughing gas,\" besides various other combinations of these, werewelcomed as so many heavenly blessings to the suffering portion of humanity.Poor Dr. Horace Wells, of Hartford, in 1844, was the discoverer, and Drs. Mortonand Jackson reaped the honors and benefits in 1846, as is usual in such cases.The anaesthetics were proclaimed \"the greatest discovery ever made.\" And, thoughthe famous Letheon of Morton and Jackson (a compound of sulphuric ether), thechloroform of Sir James Y. Simpson, and the nitrous oxide gas, introduced byColton, in 1843, and by Dunham and Smith, were occasionally checked by fatalcases, it still did not prevent these gentlemen from being considered publicbenefactors. The patients successfully put to sleep sometimes awoke no more;what matters that, so long as others were relieved? Physicians assure us thataccidents are now but rarely apprehended. Perhaps it is because the beneficentanaesthetic agents are so parsimoniously applied as to fail in their effectsone-half of the time, leaving the sufferer paralyzed for a few seconds in hisexternal movements, but feeling the pain as acutely as ever. On the whole,however, chloroform and laughing gas are beneficent discoveries. But, are theythe first anesthetics ever discovered, strictly speaking? Dioscorides speaks ofthe stone of Memphis (lapis Memphiticus), and describes it as a smallpebble--round, polished, and very sparkling. When ground into powder, andapplied as an ointment to that part of the body on which the surgeon was aboutto operate, either with his scalpel or fire, it preserved that part, and onlythat part from any pain of the operation. In the meantime, it was perfectlyharmless to the constitution of the patient, who retained his consciousnessthroughout, in no way dangerous from its effects, and acted so long as it waskept on the affected part. When taken in a mixture of wine or water, all feelingof suffering was perfectly deadened. * Pliny gives also a full description ofit. ** From time immemorial, the Brahmans have had in their possession secrets quite asvaluable. The widow, bent on the self-sacrifice of concremation, calledSahamaranya, has no dread of suffering the least pain, for the fiercest flameswill consume her, without one pang of agony being experienced by her. The holyplants which crown her brow, as she is conducted in ceremony to the funeralpile; the sacred root culled at the midnight hour on the spot where the Gangesand the Yumna mingle their waters; and the process of anointing the body of theself-appointed victim with ghee and sacred oils, after she has bathed in all herclothes and finery, are so many magical anaesthetics. Supported by those she isgoing to part with in body, she walks thrice around her fiery couch, and, afterbidding them farewell, is cast on the dead body of her husband, and leaves thisworld without a single moment of suffering. \"The semi-fluid,\" says a missionarywriter, an eye-witness of several such ceremonies--\"the ghee, is poured upon thepile; it is instantly inflamed, and the drugged widow dies quickly ofsuffocation before the fire reaches her body.\" * No such thing, if the sacred ceremony is only conducted strictly after theprescribed rites. The widows are never drugged in the sense we are accustomed tounderstand the word. Only precautionary measures are taken against a uselessphysical martyrdom--the atrocious agony of burning. Her mind is as free andclear as ever, and even more so. Firmly believing in the promises of a futurelife, her whole mind is absorbed in the contemplation of the approachingbliss--the beatitude of \"freedom,\" which she is about to attain. She generallydies with the smile of heavenly rapture on her countenance; and if some one isto suffer at the hour of retribution, it is not the earnest devotee of herfaith, but the crafty Brahmans who know well enough that no such ferocious ritewas ever prescribed. **As to the victim, after having been consumed, she becomesa sati--transcendent purity--and is canonized after death. Egypt is the birthplace and the cradle of chemistry. Kenrick shows the root ofthe word to be chemi or chem, which was the name of the country (Psalms cv. 27).The chemistry of colors seems to have been thoroughly well known in thatcountry. Facts are facts. Where among our painters are we to search for theartist who can decorate our walls with imperishable colors? Ages after our pigmybuildings will have crumbled into dust, and the cities enclosing them willthemselves have become shapeless heaps of brick and mortar, with forgottennames--long after that will the halls of Karnak and Luxor (El-Uxor) be stillstanding; and the gorgeous mural paintings of the latter will doubtless be asbright and vivid 4,000 years hence, as they were 4,000 years ago, and areto-day. \"Embalming and fresco-painting,\" says our author, \"was not a chancediscovery with the Egyptians, but brought out from definitions and maxims likeany induction of Faraday.\" Our modern Italians boast of their Etruscan vases and paintings; the decorativeborders found on Greek vases provoke the admiration of the lovers of antiquity,and are ascribed to the Greeks, while in fact \"they were but copies from theEgyptian vases.\" Their figures can be found any day on the walls of a tomb ofthe age of Amunoph I., a period at which Greece was not even in existence. Where, in our age, can we point to anything comparable to the rock-temples ofIpsambul in Lower Nubia? There may be seen sitting figures seventy feet high,carved out of the living rock. The torso of the statue of Rameses II., atThebes, measures sixty feet around the shoulders, and elsewhere in proportion.Beside such titanic sculpture our own seems that of pigmies. Iron was known tothe Egyptians at least long before the construction of the first pyramid, whichis over 20,000 years ago, according to Bunsen. The proof of this had remainedhidden for many thousands of years in the pyramid of Cheops, until ColonelHoward Vyse found it in the shape of a piece of iron, in one of the joints,where it had evidently been placed at the time this pyramid was first built.Egyptologists adduce many indications that the ancients were perfectly wellacquainted with metallurgy in prehistoric times. \"To this day we can find atSinai large heaps of scoriae, produced by smelting.\" *Metallurgy and chemistry,as practiced in those days, were known as alchemy, and were at the bottom ofprehistoric magic. Moreover, Moses proved his knowledge of alchemical chemistryby pulverizing the golden calf, and strewing the powder upon the water. If now we turn to navigation, we will find ourselves able to prove, on goodauthorities, that Necho II. fitted out a fleet on the Red Sea and despatched itfor exploration. The fleet was absent above two years and instead of returningthrough the Straits of Babelmandeb, as was wont, sailed back through the Straitsof Gibraltar. Herodotus was not at all swift to concede to the Egyptians amaritime achievement so vast as this. They had, he says, been spreading thereport that \"returning homewards, they had the sunrise on their right hands; athing which to me is incredible.\" \"And yet,\" remarks the author of theheretofore-mentioned article, \"this incredible assertion is now provedincontestable, as may well be understood by any one who has doubled the Cape ofGood Hope.\" Thus it is proved that the most ancient of these people performed afeat which was attributed to Columbus many ages later. They say they anchoredtwice on their way; sowed corn, reaped it and, sailing away, steered in triumphthrough the Pillars of Hercules and eastward along the Mediterranean. \"There wasa people,\" he adds, \"much more deserving of the term 'veteres' than the Romansand Greeks. The Greeks, young in their knowledge, sounded a trumpet before theseand called upon all the world to admire their ability. Old Egypt, grown gray inher wisdom, was so secure of her acquirements that she did not invite admirationand cared no more for the opinion of the flippant Greek than we do to-day forthat of a Feejee islander.\" \"O Solon, Solon,\" said the oldest Egyptian priest to that sage. \"You Greeks areever childish, having no ancient opinion, no discipline of any long standing!\"And very much surprised, indeed, was the great Solon, when he was told by thepriests of Egypt that so many gods and goddesses of the Grecian Pantheon werebut the disguised gods of Egypt. Truly spoke Zonaras: \"All these things came tous from Chaldea to Egypt; and from thence were derived to the Greeks.\" Sir David Brewster gives a glowing description of several automata; and theeighteenth century takes pride in that masterpiece of mechanical art, the\"flute-player of Vaucanson.\" The little we can glean of positive information onthat subject, from ancient writers, warrants the belief that the learnedmechanicians in the days of Archimedes, and some of them much anterior to thegreat Syracusan, were in no wise more ignorant or less ingenious than our moderninventors. Archytas, a native of Tarentum, in Italy, the instructor of Plato, aphilosopher distinguished for his mathematical achievements and wonderfuldiscoveries in practical mechanics, constructed a wooden dove. It must have beenan extraordinarily ingenious mechanism, as it flew, fluttered its wings, andsustained itself for a considerable time in the air. This skilful man, who lived400 years B.C., invented besides the wooden dove, the screw, the crane, andvarious hydraulic machines. * Egypt pressed her own grapes and made wine. Nothing remarkable in that, so far,but she brewed her own beer, and in great quantity--our Egyptologist goes on tosay. The Ebers manuscript proves now, beyond doubt, that the Egyptians used beer2,000 years B.C. Their beer must have been strong and excellent--like everythingthey did. Glass was manufactured in all its varieties. In many of the Egyptiansculptures we find scenes of glass-blowing and bottles; occasionally, duringarchaeological researches, glasses and glassware are found, and very beautifulthey seem to have been. Sir Gardner Wilkinson says that the Egyptians cut,ground, and engraved glass, and possessed the art of introducing gold betweenthe two surfaces of the substance. They imitated with glass, pearls, emeralds,and all the precious stones to a great perfection. Likewise, the most ancient Egyptians cultivated the musical arts, and understoodwell the effect of musical harmony and its influence on the human spirit. We canfind on the oldest sculptures and carvings scenes in which musicians play onvarious instruments. Music was used in the Healing Department of the temples forthe cure of nervous disorders. We discover on many monuments men playing inbands in concert; the leader beating time by clapping his hands. Thus far we canprove that they understood the laws of harmony. They had their sacred music,domestic and military. The lyre, harp, and flute were used for the sacredconcerts; for festive occasions they had the guitar, the single and doublepipes, and castanets; for troops, and during military service, they hadtrumpets, tambourines, drums, and cymbals. Various kinds of harps were inventedby them, such as the lyre, sambuc, ashur; some of these had upward of twentystrings. The superiority of the Egyptian lyre over the Grecian is an admittedfact. The material out of which were made such instruments was often of verycostly and rare wood, and they were beautifully carved; they imported itsometimes from very distant countries; some were painted, inlaid withmother-of-pearl, and ornamented with colored leather. They used catgut forstrings as we do. Pythagoras learned music in Egypt and made a regular scienceof it in Italy. But the Egyptians were generally considered in antiquity as thebest music-teachers in Greece. They understood thoroughly well how to extractharmonious sounds out of an instrument by adding strings to it, as well as themultiplication of notes by shortening the strings upon its neck; which knowledgeshows a great progress in the musical art. Speaking of harps, in a tomb atThebes, Bruce remarks that, \"they overturn all the accounts hitherto given ofthe earliest state of music and musical instruments in the East, and arealtogether, in their form, ornaments and compass, an incontestable proof,stronger than a thousand Greek quotations, that geometry, drawing, mechanics,and music were at the greatest perfection when these instruments were made; andthat the period from which we date the invention of these arts was only thebeginning of the era of their restoration.\" On the walls of the palace of Amenoph II. at Thebes, the king is represented asplaying chess with the queen. This monarch reigned long before the Trojan war.In India the game is known to have been played at least 5,000 years ago. As to their knowledge in medicine, now that one of the lost Books of Hermes hasbeen found and translated by Ebers, the Egyptians can speak for themselves. Thatthey understood about the circulation of the blood, appears certain from thehealing manipulations of the priests, who knew how to draw blood downward, stopits circulation for awhile, etc. A more careful study of their bas-reliefsrepresenting scenes taking place in the healing hall of various temples willeasily demonstrate it. They had their dentists and oculists, and no doctor wasallowed to practice more than one specialty; which certainly warrants the beliefthat they lost fewer patients in those days than our physicians do now. It isalso asserted by some authorities that the Egyptians were the first people inthe world who introduced trial by jury; although we doubt this ourselves. But the Egyptians were not the only people of remote epochs whose achievementsplace them in so commanding a position before the view of posterity. Besidesothers whose history is at present shut in behind the mists of antiquity--suchas the prehistoric races of the two Americas, of Crete, of the Troad, of theLacustrians, of the submerged continent of the fabled Atlantis, now classed withmyths--the deeds of the Phoenicians stamp them with almost the character ofdemi-gods. The writer in the National Quarterly Review, previously quoted, says that thePhoenicians were the earliest navigators of the world, founded most of thecolonies of the Mediterranean, and voyaged to whatever other regions wereinhabited. They visited the Arctic regions, whence they brought accounts ofeternal days without a night, which Homer has preserved for us in the Odyssey.From the British Isles they imported tin into Africa, and Spain was a favoritesite for their colonies. The description of Charybdis so completely answers tothe maelstrom that, as this writer says: \"It is difficult to imagine it to havehad any other prototype.\" Their explorations, it seems, extended in everydirection, their sails whitening the Indian Ocean, as well as the Norwegianfiords. Different writers have accorded to them the settlement of remotelocalities; while the entire southern coast of the Mediterranean was occupied bytheir cities. A large portion of the African territory is asserted to have beenpeopled by the races expelled by Joshua and the children of Israel. At the timewhen Procopius wrote, columns stood in Mauritania Tingitana, which bore theinscription, in Phoenician characters, \"We are those who fled before the brigandJoshua, the son of Nun or Nave.\" Some suppose these hardy navigators of Arctic and Antarctic waters have been theprogenitors of the races which built the temples and palaces of Palenque andUxmal, of Copan and Arica. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_763] Brasseur de Bourbourggives us much information about the manners and customs, architecture and arts,and especially of the magic and magicians of the ancient Mexicans. He tells usthat Votan, their fabulous hero and the greatest of their magicians, returningfrom a long voyage, visited King Solomon at the time of the building of thetemple. This Votan appears to be identical with the dreaded Quetzo-Cohuatl whoappears in all the Mexican legends; and curiously enough these legends bear astriking resemblance, insomuch as they relate to the voyages and exploits of theHittim, with the Hebrew Bible accounts of the Hivites, the descendants of Heth,son of Chanaan. The record tells us that Votan \"furnished to Solomon the mostvaluable particulars as to the men, animals, and plants, the gold and preciouswoods of the Occident,\" but refused point-blank to afford any clew to the routehe sailed, or the manner of reaching the mysterious continent. Solomon himselfgives an account of this interview in his History of the Wonders of theUniverse, the chief Votan figuring under the allegory of the Navigating Serpent.Stephens, indulging in the anticipation \"that a key surer than that of theRosetta-stone will be discovered,\" by which the American hieroglyphs may beread, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_764] says that thedescendants of the Caciques and the Aztec subjects are believed to survive stillin the inaccessible fastnesses of the Cordilleras \"wildernesses, which havenever yet been penetrated by a white man, . . . living as their fathers did,erecting the same buildings . . . with ornaments of sculpture and plastered;large courts, and lofty towers with high ranges of steps, and still carving ontablets of stone the same mysterious hieroglyphics.\" He adds, \"I turn to thatvast and unknown region, untraversed by a single road, wherein fancy picturesthat mysterious city seen from the topmost range of the Cordilleras ofunconquered, unvisited, and unsought aboriginal inhabitants.\" Apart from the fact that this mysterious city has been seen from a greatdistance by daring travellers, there is no intrinsic improbability of itsexistence, for who can tell what became of the primitive people who fled beforethe rapacious brigands of Cortez and Pizarro? Dr. Tschuddi, in his work on Peru,tells us of an Indian legend that a train of 10,000 llamas, laden with gold tocomplete the unfortunate Inca's ransom, was arrested in the Andes by the tidingsof his death, and the enormous treasure was so effectually concealed that not atrace of it has ever been found. He, as well as Prescott and other writers,informs us that the Indians to this day preserve their ancient traditions andsacerdotal caste, and obey implicitly the orders of rulers chosen amongthemselves, while at the same time nominally Catholics and actually subject tothe Peruvian authorities. Magical ceremonies practiced by their forefathersstill prevail among them, and magical phenomena occur. So persistent are they intheir loyalty to the past, that it seems impossible but that they should be inrelations with some central source of authority which constantly supports andstrengthens their faith, keeping it alive. May it not be that the sources ofthis undying faith lie in this mysterious city, with which they are in secretcommunication? Or must we think that all of the above is again but a \"curiouscoincidence\"? The story of this mysterious city was told to Stephens by a Spanish Padre, in1838-9. The priest swore to him that he had seen it with his own eyes, and gaveStephens the following details, which the traveller firmly believed to be true.\"The Padre of the little village near the ruins of Santa Cruz del Quiche, hadheard of the unknown city at the village of Chajul. . . . He was then young, andclimbed with much labor to the naked summit of the topmost ridge of the sierraof the Cordillera. When arrived at a height of ten or twelve thousand feet, helooked over an immense plain extending to Yucatan and the Gulf of Mexico, andsaw, at a great distance, a large city spread over a great space, and withturrets white and glittering in the sun. Tradition says that no white man hasever reached this city; that the inhabitants speak the Maya language, know thatstrangers have conquered their whole land, and murder any white man who attemptsto enter their territory. . . . They have no coin; no horses, cattle, mules, orother domestic animals except fowls, and the cocks they keep underground toprevent their crowing being heard.\" Nearly the same was given us personally about twenty years ago, by an old nativepriest, whom we met in Peru, and with whom we happened to have businessrelations. He had passed all his life vainly trying to conceal his hatred towardthe conquerors--\"brigands,\" he termed them; and, as he confessed, kept friendswith them and the Catholic religion for the sake of his people, but he was astruly a sun-worshipper in his heart as ever he was. He had travelled in hiscapacity of a converted native missionary, and had been at Santa Cruz, and, ashe solemnly affirmed, had been also to see some of his people by a \"subterraneanpassage\" leading into the mysterious city. We believe his account; for a man whois about to die, will rarely stop to invent idle stories; and this one we havefound corroborated in Stephen's Travels. Besides, we know of two other citiesutterly unknown to European travellers; not that the inhabitants particularlydesire to hide themselves; for people from Buddhistic countries comeoccasionally to visit them. But their towns are not set down on the European orAsiatic maps; and, on account of the too zealous and enterprising Christianmissionaries, and perhaps for more mysterious reasons of their own, the fewnatives of other countries who are aware of the existence of these two citiesnever mention them. Nature has provided strange nooks and hiding-places for herfavorites; and unfortunately it is but far away from so-called civilizedcountries that man is free to worship the Deity in the way that his fathers did. Even the erudite and sober Max Muller is somehow unable to get rid ofcoincidences. To him they come in the shape of the most unexpected discoveries.These Mexicans, for instance, whose obscure origin, according to the laws ofprobability, has no connection with the Aryans of India, nevertheless, like theHindus, represent an eclipse of the moon as \"the moon being devoured by adragon.\" * And though Professor Muller admits that an historical intercoursebetween the two people was suspected by Alexander von Humboldt, and he himselfconsiders it possible, still the occurrence of such a fact he adds, \"need not bethe result of any historical intercourse. As we have stated above, the origin ofthe aborigines of America is a very vexed question for those interested intracing out the affiliation and migrations of peoples.\" Notwithstanding thelabor of Brasseur de Bourbourg, and his elaborate translation of the famousPopol-Vuh, alleged to be written by Ixtlilxochitl, after weighing its contents,the antiquarian remains as much in the dark as ever. We have read the Popol-Vuhin its original translation, and the review of the same by Max Muller, and outof the former find shining a light of such brightness, that it is no wonder thatthe matter-of-fact, skeptical scientists should be blinded by it. But so far asan author can be judged by his writings, Professor Max Muller is no unfairskeptic; and, moreover, very little of importance escapes his attention. How isit then that a man of such immense and rare erudition, accustomed as he is toembrace at one eagle glance the traditions, religious customs, and superstitionsof a people, detecting the slightest similarity, and taking in the smallestdetails, failed to give any importance or perhaps even suspect what the humbleauthor of the present volume, who has neither scientific training nor erudition,to any extent, apprehended at first view? Fallacious and unwarranted as to manymay seem this remark, it appears to us that science loses more than she gains byneglecting the ancient and even mediaeval esoteric literature, or rather whatremains of it. To one who devotes himself to such study many a coincidence istransformed into a natural result of demonstrable antecedent causes. We think wecan see how it is that Professor Muller confesses that \"now and then . . . oneimagines one sees certain periods and landmarks, but in the next page all ischaos again.\" ** May it not be barely possible that this chaos is intensified bythe fact that most of the scientists, directing the whole of their attention tohistory, skip that which they treat as \"vague, contradictory, miraculous,absurd.\" Notwithstanding the feeling that there was \"a groundwork of nobleconceptions which has been covered and distorted by an aftergrowth of fantasticnonsense,\" Professor Muller cannot help comparing this nonsense to the tales ofthe Arabian Nights. Far be from us the ridiculous pretension of criticising a scientist so worthy ofadmiration for his learning as Max Muller. But we cannot help saying that evenamong the fantastic nonsense of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments anythingwould be worthy of attention, if it should help toward the evolving of somehistorical truth. Homer's Odyssey surpasses in fantastic nonsense all the talesof the Arabian Nights combined; and notwithstanding that, many of his myths arenow proved to be something else besides the creation of the old poet's fancy.The Laestrygonians, who devoured the companions of Ulysses, are traced to thehuge cannibal * race, said in primitive days to inhabit the caves of Norway.Geology verified through her discoveries some of the assertions of Homer,supposed for so many ages to have been but poetical hallucinations. Theperpetual daylight enjoyed by this race of Laestrygonians indicates that theywere inhabitants of the North Cape, where, during the whole summer, there isperpetual daylight. The Norwegian fiords are perfectly described by Homer in hisOdyssey, x. 110; and the gigantic stature of the Laestrygonians is demonstratedby human bones of unusual size found in caves situated near this region, andwhich the geologists suppose to have belonged to a race extinct long before theAryan immigration. Charybdis, as we have seen, has been recognized in themaelstrom; and the Wandering Rocks ** in the enormous icebergs of the Arcticseas. If the consecutive attempts at the creation of man described in the QuicheCosmogony suggests no comparison with some Apocrypha, with the Jewish sacredbooks, and the kabalistic theories of creation, it is indeed strange. Even theBook of Jasher, condemned as a gross forgery of the twelfth century, may furnishmore than one clew to trace a relation between the population of Ur of theKasdeans, where Magism flourished before the days of Abraham, and those ofCentral and North America. The divine beings, \"brought down to the level ofhuman nature,\" performed no feats or tricks more strange or incredible than themiraculous performances of Moses and of Pharaoh's magicians, while many of theseare exactly similar in their nature. And when, moreover, in addition to thislatter fact, we find so great a resemblance between certain kabalistic termscommon to both hemispheres, there must be something else than mere accident toaccount for the circumstance. Many of such feats have clearly a commonparentage. The story of the two brothers of Central America, who, beforestarting on their journey to Xibalba, \"plant each a cane in the middle of theirgrandmother's house, that she may know by its flourishing or withering whetherthey are alive or dead,\" *finds its analogy in the beliefs of many othercountries. In the Popular Tales and Traditions, by Sacharoff (Russia), one canfind a similar narrative, and trace this belief in various other legends. Andyet these fairy tales were current in Russia many centuries before America wasdiscovered. In recognizing in the gods of Stonehenge the divinities of Delphos and Babylon,one need feel little surprised. Bel and the Dragon, Apollo and Python, Osirisand Typhon, are all one under many names, and have travelled far and wide. TheBoth-al of Ireland points directly to its first parent, the Batylos of theGreeks and the Beth-el of Chanaan. \"History,\" says H. de la Villemarque, \"whichtook no notes at those distant ages, can plead ignorance, but the science oflanguages affirms. Philology, with a daily-increasing probability, has againlinked together the chain hardly broken between the Orient and the Occident.\" ** No more remarkable is the discovery of a like resemblance between the Orientalmyths and ancient Russian tales and traditions, for it is entirely natural tolook for a similarity between the beliefs of the Semitic and Aryan families. Butwhen we discover an almost perfect identity between the character of ZarevnaMilitrissa, with a moon in her forehead, who is in constant danger of beingdevoured by Zmey Gorenetch (the Serpent or Dragon), who plays such a prominentpart in all popular Russian tales, and similar characters in the Mexicanlegends--extending to the minutest details--we may well pause and ask ourselveswhether there be not here more than a simple coincidence. This tradition of the Dragon and the Sun--occasionally replaced by the Moon--hasawakened echoes in the remotest parts of the world. It may be accounted for withperfect readiness by the once universal heliolatrous religion. There was a timewhen Asia, Europe, Africa, and America were covered with the temples sacred tothe sun and the dragons. The priests assumed the names of their deities, andthus the tradition of these spread like a net-work all over the globe: \"Bel andthe Dragon being uniformly coupled together, and the priest of the Ophitereligion as uniformly assuming the name of his god.\" *** But still, \"if theoriginal conception is natural and intelligible . . . and its occurrence neednot be the result of any historical intercourse,\" as Professor Muller tells us,the details are so strikingly similar that we cannot feel satisfied that theriddle is entirely solved. The origin of this universal symbolical worship beingconcealed in the night of time, we would have far more chance to arrive at thetruth by tracing these traditions to their very source. And where is thissource? Kircher places the origin of the Ophite and heliolatrous worship, theshape of conical monuments and the obelisks, with the Egyptian HermesTrismegistus. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_772] Where,then, except in Hermetic books, are we to seek for the desired information? Isit likely that modern authors can know more, or as much, of ancient myths andcults as the men who taught them to their contemporaries? Clearly two things arenecessary: first, to find the missing books of Hermes; and second, the key bywhich to understand them, for reading is not sufficient. Failing in this, oursavants are abandoned to unfruitful speculations, as for a like reasongeographers waste their energies in a vain quest of the sources of the Nile.Truly the land of Egypt is another abode of mystery! Without stopping to discuss whether Hermes was the \"Prince of post-diluvianmagic,\" as des Mousseaux calls him, or the antediluvian, which is much morelikely, one thing is certain: The authenticity, reliability, and usefulness ofthe Books of Hermes--or rather of what remains of the thirty-six worksattributed to the Egyptian magician--are fully recognized by Champollion,junior, and corroborated by Champollion-Figeac, who mentions it. Now, if bycarefully looking over the kabalistical works, which are all derived from thatuniversal storehouse of esoteric knowledge, we find the fac-similes of manyso-called miracles wrought by magical art, equally reproduced by the Quiches;and if even in the fragments left of the original Popol-Vuh, there is sufficientevidence that the religious customs of the Mexicans, Peruvians, and otherAmerican races are nearly identical with those of the ancient Phoenicians,Babylonians, and Egyptians; and if, moreover, we discover that many of theirreligious terms have etymologically the same origin; how are we to avoidbelieving that they are the descendants of those whose forefathers \"fled beforethe brigand, Joshua, the son of Nun?\" \"Nunez de la Vega says that Nin, or Imos,of the Tzendales, was the Ninus of the Babylonians.\" ** It is possible that, so far, it may be a coincidence; as the identification ofone with the other rests but upon a poor argument. \"But it is known,\" adds deBourbourg, \"that this prince, and according to others, his father, Bel, or Baal,received, like the Nin of the Tzendales the homages of his subjects under theshape of a serpent.\" The latter assertion, besides being fantastic, is nowherecorroborated in the Babylonian records. It is very true that the Phoeniciansrepresented the sun under the image of a dragon; but so did all the other peoplewho symbolized their sun-gods. Belus, the first king of the Assyrian dynastywas, according to Castor, and Eusebius who quotes him, deified, i.e., he wasranked among the gods \"after his death\" only. Thus, neither himself nor his son,Ninus, or Nin, could have received their subjects under the shape of a serpent,whatever the Tzendales did. Bel, according to Christians, is Baal; and Baal isthe Devil, since the Bible prophets began so designating every deity of theirneighbors; therefore Belus, Ninus, and the Mexican Nin are serpents and devils;and, as the Devil, or father of evil, is one under many forms, therefore, underwhatever name the serpent appears, it is the Devil. Strange logic! Why not saythat Ninus the Assyrian, represented as husband and victim of the ambitiousSemiramis, was high priest as well as king of his country? That as such he woreon his tiara the sacred emblems of the dragon and the sun? Moreover, as thepriest generally assumed the name of his god, Ninus was said to receive hissubject as the representative of this serpent-god. The idea is preeminentlyRoman Catholic and amounts to very little, as all their inventions do. If Nunezde la Vega was so anxious to establish an affiliation between the Mexicans andthe biblical sun- and serpent-worshippers, why did he not show another and abetter similarity between them without tracing in the Ninevites and theTzendales the hoof and horn of the Christian Devil? And to begin with, he might have pointed to the Chronicles of Fuentes, of thekingdom of Guatemala, and to the Manuscript of Don Juan Torres, the grandson ofthe last king of the Quiches. This document, which is said to have been in thepossession of the lieutenant-general appointed by Pedro de Alvarado, states thatthe Toltecas themselves descended from the house of Israel, who were released byMoses, and who, after crossing the Red Sea, fell into idolatry. After that,having separated themselves from their companions, and under the guidance of achief named Tanub, they set out wandering, and from one continent to anotherthey came to a place named the Seven Caverns, in the Kingdom of Mexico, wherethey founded the famous town of Tula, etc. * If this statement has never obtained more credit than it has, it is simply dueto the fact that it passed through the hands of Father Francis Vasques,historian of the Order of San Francis, and this circumstance, to use theexpression employed by des Mousseaux in connection with the work of the poor,unfrocked Abbe Huc, \"is not calculated to strengthen our confidence.\" But thereis another point as important, if not more so, as it seems to have escapedfalsification by the zealous Catholic padres, and rests chiefly on Indiantradition. A famous Toltecan king, whose name is mixed up in the weird legendsof Utatlan, the ruined capital of the great Indian kingdom, bore the biblicalappellation of Balam Acan; the first name being preeminently Chaldean, andreminding one immediately of Balaam and his human-voiced ass. Besides thestatement of Lord Kingsborough, who found such a striking similarity between thelanguage of the Aztecs (the mother tongue) and the Hebrew, many of the figureson the bas-reliefs of Palenque and idols in terra cotta, exhumed in Santa Cruzdel Quiche, have on their heads bandelets with a square protuberance on them, infront of the forehead, very similar to the phylacteries worn by the HebrewPharisees of old, while at prayers, and even by devotees of the present day,particularly the Jews of Poland and Russia. But as this may be but a fancy ofours, after all, we will not insist on the details. Upon the testimony of the ancients, corroborated by modern discoveries, we knowthat there were numerous catacombs in Egypt and Chaldea, some of them of a veryvast extent. The most renowned of them were the subterranean crypts of Thebesand Memphis. The former, beginning on the western side of the Nile, extendedtoward the Libyan desert, and were known as the Serpent's catacombs, orpassages. It was there that were performed the sacred mysteries of the kuklosanagkes, the \"Unavoidable Cycle,\" more generally known as the \"circle ofnecessity\"; the inexorable doom imposed upon every soul after the bodily death,and when it had been judged in the Amenthian region. In de Bourbourg's book, Votan, the Mexican demi-god, in narrating hisexpedition, describes a subterranean passage, which ran underground, andterminated at the root of the heavens, adding that this passage was a snake'shole, \"un agujero de culebra\"; and that he was admitted to it because he washimself \"a son of the snakes,\" or a serpent. * This is, indeed, very suggestive; for his description of the snake's hole isthat of the ancient Egyptian crypt, as above mentioned. The hierophants,moreover, of Egypt, as of Babylon, generally styled themselves the \"Sons of theSerpent-god,\" or \"Sons of the Dragon\"; not because--as des Mousseaux would havehis readers believe--they were the progeny of Satan-incubus, the old serpent ofEden, but because, in the Mysteries, the serpent was the symbol of WISDOM andimmortality.\"The Assyrian priest bore always the name of his god,\" saysMovers. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_776] The Druids ofthe Celto-Britannic regions also called themselves snakes. \"I am a Serpent, I ama Druid!\" they exclaimed. The Egyptian Karnak is twin-brother to the Carnac ofBretagne, the latter Carnac meaning the serpent's mount. The Dracontia oncecovered the surface of the globe, and these temples were sacred to the dragon,only because it was the symbol of the sun, which, in its turn, was the symbol ofthe highest god--the Phoenician Elon or Elion, whom Abraham recognized as ElElion. **Besides the surname of serpents, they were called the \"builders,\" the\"architects\"; for the immense grandeur of their temples and monuments was such,that even now the pulverized remains of them \"frighten the mathematicalcalculations of our modern engineers,\" says Taliesin. *** De Bourbourg hints that the chiefs of the name of Votan, the Quetzo-Cohuatl, orserpent deity of the Mexicans, are the descendants of Ham and Canaan. \"I amHivim,\" they say. \"Being a Hivim, I am of the great race of the Dragon (snake).I am a snake myself, for I am a Hivim.\" **** And des Mousseaux, rejoicingbecause he believes himself fairly on the serpent's, or rather, devil's trail,hurries to explain: \"According to the most learned commentators of our sacredbooks, the Chivim or Hivim, or Hevites, descend from Heth, son of Canaan, son ofHam . . . the accursed!\" ***** But modern research has demonstrated, on unimpeachable evidence, that the wholegenealogical table of the tenth chapter of Genesis refers to imaginary heroes,and that the closing verses of the ninth are little better than a bit ofChaldean allegory of Sisuthrus and the mythical flood, compiled and arranged tofit the Noachian frame. But, suppose the descendants of these Canaanites, \"theaccursed,\" were to resent for once the unmerited outrage? It would be an easymatter for them to reverse the tables, and answer to this fling, based on afable, by a fact proved by archaeologists and symbologists--namely, that Seth,Adam's third son, and the forefather of all Israel, the ancestor of Noah, andthe progenitor of the \"chosen people,\" is but Hermes, the god of wisdom, calledalso Thoth, Tat, Seth, Set, and Sat-an; and that he was, furthermore, whenviewed under his bad aspect, Typhon, the Egyptian Satan, who was also Set. Forthe Jewish people, whose well-educated men, no more than Philo, or Josephus, thehistorian, regard their Mosaic books as otherwise than an allegory, such adiscovery amounts to but little. But for Christians, who, like des Mousseaux,very unwisely accept the Bible narratives as literal history, the case standsvery different. As far as affiliation goes, we agree with this pious writer; and we feel everyday as certain that some of the peoples of Central America will be traced backto the Phoenicians and the Mosaic Israelites, as we do that the latter will beproved to have as persistently stuck to the same idolatry--if idolatry thereis--of the sun and serpent-worship, as the Mexicans. There is evidence--biblicalevidence--that two of Jacob's sons, Levi and Dan, as well as Judah, marriedCanaanite women, and followed the worship of their wives. Of course, everyChristian will protest, but the proof may be found even in the translated Bible,pruned as it now stands. The dying Jacob thus describes his sons: \"Dan,\" sayshe, \"shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth thehorse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. . . . I have waited for thysalvation, 0 Lord!\" Of Simeon and Levi, the patriarch (or Israel) remarks thatthey \". . . are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O mysoul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_781] Now, in the original, thewords \"their secret,\" read--their SOD. **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_782] And Sod was the name forthe great Mysteries of Baal, Adonis, and Bacchus who were all sun-gods and hadserpents for symbols. The kabalists explain the allegory of the fiery serpentsby saying, that this was the name given to the tribe of Levi, to all the Levitesin short, and that Moses was the chief of the Sodales. *** And here is themoment to prove our statements. Moses is mentioned by several old historians as an Egyptian priest; Manetho sayshe was a hierophant of Hieropolis, and a priest of the sun-god Osiris, and thathis name was Osarsiph. Those moderns, who accept it as a fact that he \"waslearned in all the wisdom\" of the Egyptians, must also submit to the rightinterpretation of the word wisdom, which was throughout the world known as asynonym of initiation into the secret mysteries of the Magi. Did the idea neverstrike the reader of the Bible, that an alien born and brought up in a foreigncountry could not and would not possibly have been admitted--we will not say tothe final initiation, the grandest mystery of all, but even to share theknowledge of the minor priesthood, those who belonged to the lesser mysteries?In Genesis xliii. 32, we read, that no Egyptian could seat himself to eat breadwith the brothers of Joseph, \"for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.\"But that the Egyptians ate \"with him (Joseph) by themselves.\" The above provestwo things: 1, that Joseph, whatever he was in his heart, had, in appearance atleast, changed his religion, married the daughter of a priest of the\"idolatrous\" nation, and become himself an Egyptian; otherwise, the nativeswould not have eaten bread with him. And 2, that subsequently Moses, if not anEgyptian by birth, became one through being admitted into the priesthood, andthus was a SODALE. As an induction, the narrative of the \"brazen serpent\" (theCaduceus of Mercury or Asclepios, the son of the sun-god Apollo-Python) becomeslogical and natural. We must bear in mind that Pharaoh's daughter, who savedMoses and adopted him, is called by Josephus Thermuthis; and the latter,according to Wilkinson, is the name of the asp sacred to Isis; * moreover, Mosesis said to descend from the tribe of Levi. We will explain the kabalistic ideasas to the books of Moses and the great prophet himself more fully in Volume II. If Brasseur de Bourbourg and the Chevalier des Mousseaux, had so much at heartto trace the identity of the Mexicans with the Canaanites, they might have foundfar better and weightier proofs than by showing both the \"accursed\" descendantsof Ham. For instance, they might have pointed to the Nargal, the Chaldean andAssyrian chief of the Magi (Rab-Mag) and the Nagal, the chief sorcerer of theMexican Indians. Both derive their names from Nergal-Sarezer, the Assyrian god,and both have the same faculties, or powers to have an attendant daemon withwhom they identify themselves completely. The Chaldean and Assyrian Nargal kepthis daemon, in the shape of some animal considered sacred, inside the temple;the Indian Nagal keeps his wherever he can--in the neighboring lake, or wood, orin the house, under the shape of a house-hold animal. ** We find the Catholic World, newspaper, in a recent number, bitterly complainingthat the old Pagan element of the aboriginal inhabitants of America does notseem to be utterly dead in the United States. Even where tribes have been forlong years under the care of Christian teachers, heathen rites are practiced insecret, and crypto-paganism, or nagualism, flourishes now, as in the days ofMontezuma. It says: \"Nagualism and voodoo-worship\"--as it calls these twostrange sects--\"are direct devil-worship. A report addressed to the Cortes in1812, by Don Pedro Baptista Pino, says: 'All the pueblos have their artufas--sothe natives call subterranean rooms with only a single door, where they assembleto perform their feasts, and hold meetings. These are impenetrable temples . . .and the doors are always closed on the Spaniards. \" 'All these pueblos, in spite of the sway which religion has had over them,cannot forget a part of the beliefs which have been transmitted to them, andwhich they are careful to transmit to their descendants. Hence come theadoration they render the sun and moon, and other heavenly bodies, the respectthey entertain for fire, etc. \" 'The pueblo chiefs seem to be at the same time priests; they perform varioussimple rites, by which the power of the sun and of Montezuma is recognized, aswell as the power (according to some accounts) of the Great Snake, to whom, byorder of Montezuma, they are to look for life. They also officiate in certainceremonies with which they pray for rain. There are painted representations ofthe Great Snake, together with that of a misshapen, red-haired man, declared tostand for Montezuma. Of this last there was also, in the year 1845, in thepueblo of Laguna, a rude effigy or idol, intended, apparently, to represent onlythe head of the deity.' \" * The perfect identity of the rites, ceremonies, traditions, and even the names ofthe deities, among the Mexicans and ancient Babylonians and Egyptians, are asufficient proof of South America being peopled by a colony which mysteriouslyfound its way across the Atlantic. When? at what period? History is silent onthat point; but those who consider that there is no tradition, sanctified byages, without a certain sediment of truth at the bottom of it, believe in theAtlantis-legend. There are, scattered throughout the world, a handful ofthoughtful and solitary students, who pass their lives in obscurity, far fromthe rumors of the world, studying the great problems of the physical andspiritual universes. They have their secret records in which are preserved thefruits of the scholastic labors of the long line of recluses whose successorsthey are. The knowledge of their early ancestors, the sages of India, Babylonia,Nineveh, and the imperial Thebes; the legends and traditions commented upon bythe masters of Solon, Pythagoras, and Plato, in the marble halls of Heliopolisand Sais; traditions which, in their days, already seemed to hardly glimmer frombehind the foggy curtain of the past;--all this, and much more, is recorded onindestructible parchment, and passed with jealous care from one adept toanother. These men believe the story of the Atlantis to be no fable, butmaintain that at different epochs of the past huge islands, and even continents,existed where now there is but a wild waste of waters. In those submergedtemples and libraries the archaeologist would find, could he but explore them,the materials for filling all the gaps that now exist in what we imagine ishistory. They say that at a remote epoch a traveller could traverse what is nowthe Atlantic Ocean, almost the entire distance by land, crossing in boats fromone island to another, where narrow straits then existed. Our suspicion as to the relationship of the cis-Atlantic and trans-Atlanticraces is strengthened upon reading about the wonders wrought by Quetzo-Cohuatl,the Mexican magician. His wand must be closely-related to the traditionalsapphire-stick of Moses, the stick which bloomed in the garden of Raguel-Jethro,his father-in-law, and upon which was engraved the ineffable name. The \"fourmen\" described as the real four ancestors of the human race, \"who were neitherbegotten by the gods, nor born of woman,\" but whose \"creation was a wonderwrought by the Creator,\" and who were made after three attempts at manufacturingmen had failed, equally present some striking points of similarity with theesoteric explanations of the Hermetists; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_787] they also undeniablyrecall the four sons of God of the Egyptian theogony. Moreover, as any one mayinfer, the resemblance of this myth to the narrative related in Genesis, will beapparent to even a superficial observer. These four ancestors \"could reason andspeak, their sight was unlimited, and they knew all things at once.\" ** When\"they had rendered thanks to their Creator for their existence, the gods werefrightened, and they breathed a cloud over the eyes of men that they might see acertain distance only, and not be like the gods themselves.\" This bears directlyupon the sentence in Genesis, \"Behold, the man is become as one of us, to knowgood and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree oflife,\" etc. Then, again, \"While they were asleep God gave them wives,\" etc. We disclaim the least intention to disrespectfully suggest ideas to those whoare so wise as to need no hint. But we must bear in mind that authentictreatises upon ancient magic of the Chaldean and Egyptian lore are not scatteredabout in public libraries, and at auction sales. That such exist is neverthelessa fact for many students of the arcane philosophy. Is it not of the greatestimportance for every antiquarian to be acquainted at least superficially withtheir contents? \"The four ancestors of the race,\" adds Max Muller, \"seem to havehad a long life, and when at last they came to die, they disappeared in amysterious manner, and left to their sons what is called the hidden majesty,which was never to be opened by human hands. What it was we do not know.\" If there is no relationship between this hidden majesty and the hidden glory ofthe Chaldean Kabala, which we are told was left behind him by Enoch when he wastranslated in such a mysterious way, then we must discredit all circumstantialevidence. But is it not barely possible that these \"four ancestors\" of theQuiche race typify in their esoteric sense the four successive progenitors ofmen, mentioned in Genesis i., ii., and vi.? In the first chapter, the first manis bi-sexual--\"male and female created he them\"--and answers to thehermaphrodite deities of the subsequent mythologies; the second, Adam, made outof \"the dust of the ground\" and uni-sexual and answering to the \"sons of God\" ofchapter vi.; the third, the giants, or nephilim, who are only hinted at in theBible, but fully explained elsewhere; the fourth, the parents of men \"whosedaughters were fair.\" Taking the admitted facts that the Mexicans had their magicians from the remoteperiods; that the same remark applies to all the ancient religions of the world;that a strong resemblance prevails not only in the forms of their ceremonialworship, but also in the very names used to designate certain magicalimplements; and finally that all other clews, in accordance with scientificdeductions, have failed (some because swallowed up in the bottomless pit ofcoincidences), why should we not turn to the great authorities upon magic, andsee whether, under this \"aftergrowth of fantastic nonsense,\" there may not be adeep substratum of truth? Here we are not willing to be misunderstood. We do notsend the scientists to the Kabala and the Hermetic books to study magic, but tothe authorities on magic to discover materials for history and science. We haveno idea of incurring the wrathful denunciations of the Academicians, by anindiscretion like that of poor des Mousseaux, when he tried to force them toread his demonological Memoire and investigate the Devil. The History of Bernal Diaz de Castilla, a follower of Cortez, gives us some ideaof the extraordinary refinement and intelligence of the people whom theyconquered; but the descriptions are too long to be inserted here. Suffice it tosay, that the Aztecs appeared in more than one way to have resembled the ancientEgyptians in civilization and refinement. Among both peoples magic or the arcanenatural philosophy was cultivated to the highest degree. Add to this thatGreece, the \"later cradle of the arts and sciences,\" and India, cradle ofreligions, were and are still devoted to its study and practice--and who shallventure to discredit its dignity as a study, and its profundity as a science? There never was, nor can there be more than one universal religion; for therecan be but one truth concerning God. Like an immense chain whose upper end, thealpha, remains invisibly emanating from a Deity--in statu abscondito with everyprimitive theology--it encircles our globe in every direction; it leaves noteven the darkest corner unvisited, before the other end, the omega, turns backon its way to be again received where it first emanated. On this divine chainwas strung the exoteric symbology of every people. Their variety of form ispowerless to affect their substance, and under their diverse ideal types of theuniverse of matter, symbolizing its vivifying principles, the uncorruptedimmaterial image of the spirit of being guiding them is the same. So far as human intellect can go in the ideal interpretation of the spiritualuniverse, its laws and powers, the last word was pronounced ages since; and, ifthe ideas of Plato can be simplified for the sake of easier comprehension, thespirit of their substance can neither be altered, nor removed without materialdamage to the truth. Let human brains submit themselves to torture for thousandsof years to come; let theology perplex faith and mime it with the enforcing ofincomprehensible dogmas in metaphysics; and science strengthen skepticism, bypulling down the tottering remains of spiritual intuition in mankind, with herdemonstrations of its fallibility, eternal truth can never be destroyed. We findits last possible expression in our human language in the Persian Logos, theHonover, or the living manifested Word of God. The Zoroastrian Enoch-Verihe isidentical with the Jewish \"I am\"; and the \"Great Spirit\" of the poor, untutoredIndian, is the manifested Brahma of the Hindu philosopher. One of the latter,Tcharaka, a Hindu physician, who is said to have lived 5,000 years B.C., in histreatise on the origin of things, called Usa, thus beautifully expresseshimself: \"Our Earth is, like all the luminous bodies that surround us, one ofthe atoms of the immense Whole of which we show a slight conception by termingit--the Infinite.\" \"There is but one light, and there is but one darkness,\" says a Siamese proverb.Daemon est Deus inversus, the Devil is the shadow of God, states the universalkabalistic axiom. Could light exist but for primeval darkness? And did not thebrilliant, sunny universe first stretch its infant arms from the swaddling bandsof dark and dreary chaos? If the Christian \"fulness of Him that filleth all inall\" is a revelation, then we must admit that, if there is a devil, he must beincluded in this fulness, and be a part of that which \"filleth all in all.\" Fromtime immemorial the justification of the Deity, and His separation from theexisting evil was attempted, and the object was reached by the old Orientalphilosophy in the foundation of the theodike; but their metaphysical views onthe fallen spirit, have never been disfigured by the creation of ananthropomorphic personality of the Devil as was done subsequently by the leadinglights of Christian theology. A personal fiend, who opposes the Deity, andimpedes progress on its way to perfection, is to be sought only on earth amidhumanity, not in heaven. Thus is it that all the religious monuments of old, in whatever land or underwhatever climate, are the expression of the same identical thoughts, the key towhich is in the esoteric doctrine. It would be vain, without studying thelatter, to seek to unriddle the mysteries enshrouded for centuries in thetemples and ruins of Egypt and Assyria, or those of Central America, BritishColumbia, and the Nagkon-Wat of Cambodia. If each of these was built by adifferent nation; and neither nation had had intercourse with the others forages, it is also certain that all were planned and built under the directsupervision of the priests. And the clergy of every nation, though practicingrites and ceremonies which may have differed externally, had evidently beeninitiated into the same traditional mysteries which were taught all over theworld. In order to institute a better comparison between the specimens of prehistoricarchitecture to be found at the most opposite points of the globe, we have butto point to the grandiose Hindu ruins of Ellora in the Dekkan, the MexicanChichen-Itza, in Yucatan, and the still grander ruins of Copan, in Guatemala.They present such features of resemblance that it seems impossible to escape theconviction that they were built by peoples moved by the same religious ideas,and that had reached an equal level of highest civilization in arts andsciences. There is not, perhaps, on the face of the whole globe, a more imposing mass ofruins than Nagkon-Wat, the wonder and puzzle of European archeologists whoventure into Siam. And when we say ruins, the expression is hardly correct; fornowhere are there buildings of such tremendous antiquity to be found in a betterstate of preservation than Nagkon-Wat, and the ruins of Angkorthom, the greattemple. Hidden far away in the province of Siamrap--eastern Siam--in the midst of a mostluxuriant tropical vegetation, surrounded by almost impenetrable forests ofpalms, cocoa-trees, and betel-nut, \"the general appearance of the wonderfultemple is beautiful and romantic, as well as impressive and grand,\" says Mr.Vincent, a recent traveller. * \"We whose good fortune it is to live in thenineteenth century, are accustomed to boast of the perfection and preeminence ofour modern civilization; of the grandeur of our attainments in science, art,literature, and what not, as compared with those whom we call ancients; butstill we are compelled to admit that they have far excelled our recent endeavorsin many things, and notably in the fine arts of painting, architecture, andsculpture. We were but just looking upon a most wonderful example of the twolatter, for in style and beauty of architecture, solidity of construction, andmagnificent and elaborate carving and sculpture, the Great Nagkon-Wat has nosuperior, certainly no rival standing at the present day. The first view of theruins is overwhelming.\" Thus the opinion of another traveller is added to that of many preceding ones,including archeologists and other competent critics, who have believed that theruins of the past Egyptian splendor deserve no higher eulogium than Nagkon-Wat. According to our plan, we will allow more impartial critics than ourselves todescribe the place, since, in a work professedly devoted to a vindication of theancients, the testimony of so enthusiastic an advocate as the present writer maybe questioned. We have, nevertheless, seen Nagkon-Wat under exceptionallyfavorable circumstances, and can, therefore, certify to the general correctnessof Mr. Vincent's description. He says: \"We entered upon an immense causeway, the stairs of which were flanked with sixhuge griffins, each carved from a single block of stone. The causeway is . . .725 feet in length, and is paved with stones each of which measures four feet inlength by two in breadth. On either side of it are artificial lakes fed bysprings, and each covering about five acres of ground. . . . The outer wall ofNagkon-Wat (the city of monasteries) is half a mile square, with gateways . . .which are handsomely carved with figures of gods and dragons. The foundationsare ten feet in height. . . . The entire edifice, including the roof, is ofstone, but without cement, and so closely fitting are the joints as even now tobe scarcely discernible. . . . The shape of the building is oblong, being 796feet in length, and 588 in width, while the highest central pagoda rises some250 odd feet above the ground, and four others, at the angles of the court, areeach about 150 feet in height.\" The above underscored lines are suggestive to travellers who have remarked andadmired the same wonderful mason-work in the Egyptian remains. If the sameworkmen did not lay the courses in both countries we must at least think thatthe secret of this matchless wall-building was equally known to the architectsof every land. \"Passing, we ascend a platform . . . and enter the temple itself through acolumned portico, the facade of which is beautifully carved in basso-relievowith ancient mythological subjects. From this doorway, on either side, runs acorridor with a double row of columns, cut--base and capital--from singleblocks, with a double, oval-shaped roof, covered with carving and consecutivesculptures upon the outer wall. This gallery of sculptures, which forms theexterior of the temple, consists of over half a mile of continuous pictures, cutin basso-relievo upon sandstone slabs six feet in width, and represents subjectstaken from Hindu mythology, from the Ramayana--the Sanscrit epic poem of India,with its 25,000 verses describing the exploits of the god Rama, and the son ofthe King of Oudh. The contests of the King of Ceylon, and Hanouma, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_790] the monkey-god, aregraphically represented. There is no keystone used in the arch of this corridor.On the walls are sculptured the immense number of 100,000 separate figures. Onepicture from the Ramayana . . . occupies 240 feet of the wall. . . . In theNagkon-Wat as many as 1,532 solid columns have been counted, and among theentire ruins of Angkor . . . the immense number of 6,000, almost all of themhewn from single blocks and artistically carved. . . . \"But who built Nagkon-Wat? and when was it built? Learned men have attempted toform opinions from studies of its construction, and especially ornamentation,\"and have failed. \"Native Cambodian historians,\" adds Vincent, \"reckon 2,400 fromthe building of the temple. . . . I asked one of them how long Nagkon-Wat hadbeen built. . . . 'None can tell when. . . . I do not know; it must have eithersprung up from the ground or been built by giants, or perhaps by the angels' . .. was the answer.\" When Stephens asked the native Indians \"Who built Copan? . . . what nationtraced the hieroglyphic designs, sculptured these elegant figures and carvings,these emblematical designs?\" the dull answer he received was \"Quien sabe?\"--whoknows! \"All is mystery; dark, impenetrable mystery,\" writes Stephens. \"In Egypt,the colossal skeletons of gigantic temples stand in all the nakedness ofdesolation. Here, an immense forest shrouded the ruins, hiding them fromsight.\" * But there are perhaps many circumstances, trifling for archaeologistsunacquainted with the \"idle and fanciful\" legends of old, hence overlooked;otherwise the discovery might have sent them on a new train of thought. One isthe invariable presence in the Egyptian, Mexican, and Siamese ruined temples, ofthe monkey. The Egyptian cynocephalus assumes the same postures as the Hindu andSiamese Hanouma; and among the sculptured fragments of Copan, Stephens found theremains of colossal apes or baboons, \"strongly resembling in outline andappearance the four monstrous animals which once stood in front, attached to thebase of the obelisk of Luxor, now in Paris, **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_792] and which, under the nameof the cynocephali, were worshipped at Thebes.\" In almost every Buddhist templethere are idols of huge monkeys kept, and some people have in their houses whitemonkeys on purpose \"to keep bad spirits away.\" \"Was civilization,\" writes Louis de Carne, ***\"in the complex meaning we givethat word, in keeping among the ancient Cambodians with what such prodigies ofarchitecture seem to indicate? The age of Pheidias was that of Sophocles,Socrates, and Plato; Michael Angelo and Raphael succeeded Dante. There areluminous epochs during which the human mind, developing itself in everydirection, triumphs in all, and creates masterpieces which spring from the sameinspiration.\" \"Nagkon-Wat,\" concludes Vincent, \"must be ascribed to other thanancient Cambodians. But to whom? . . . There exist no credible traditions; allis absurd fable or legend.\" The latter sentence has become of late a sort of cant phrase in the mouths oftravellers and archaeologists. When they have found that no clew is attainableunless it can be found in popular legends, they turn away discouraged, and afinal verdict is withheld. At the same time Vincent quotes a writer who remarksthat these ruins \"are as imposing as the ruins of Thebes, or Memphis, but moremysterious.\" Mouhot thinks they were erected \"by some ancient Michael Angelo,\"and adds that Nagkon-Wat \"is grander than anything left to us by Greece orRome.\" Furthermore Mouhot ascribes the building again to some of the lost tribesof Israel, and is corroborated in that opinion by Miche, the French Bishop ofCambodia, who confesses that he is struck \"by the Hebrew character of the facesof many of the savage Stiens.\" Henri Mouhot believes that, \"withoutexaggeration, the oldest parts of Angkor may be fixed at more than 2,000 yearsago.\" This, then, in comparison with the pyramids, would make them quite modern;the date is the more incredible, because the pictures on the walls may be provedto belong to those archaic ages when Poseidon and the Kabeiri were worshippedthroughout the continent. Had Nagkon-Wat been built, as Dr. Adolf Bastian * willhave it, \"for the reception of the learned patriarch, Buddhagosa, who broughtthe holy books of the Trai-Pidok from Ceylon; or, as Bishop Pallegoix, who\"refers the erection of this edifice to the reign of Phra Pathum Suriving,\" when\"the sacred books of the Buddhists were brought from Ceylon, and Buddhism becamethe religion of the Cambodians,\" how is it possible to account for thefollowing? \"We see in this same temple carved images of Buddha, four, and eventhirty-two-armed, and two and sixteen-headed gods, the Indian Vishnu, gods withwings, Burmese heads, Hindu figures, and Ceylon mythology. . . . You seewarriors riding upon elephants and in chariots, foot soldiers with shield andspear, boats, tigers, griffins . . . serpents, fishes, crocodiles, bullocks . .. soldiers of immense physical development, with helmets, and some people withbeards--probably Moors. The figures,\" adds Mr. Vincent, \"stand somewhat likethose on the great Egyptian monuments, the side partly turned toward the front .. . and I noticed, besides, five horsemen, armed with spear and sword, ridingabreast, like those seen upon the Assyrian tablets in the British Museum.\" ** For our part, we may add, that there are on the walls several repetitions ofDagon, the man-fish of the Babylonians, and of the Kabeirian gods of Samothrace.This may have escaped the notice of the few archaeologists who examined theplace; but upon stricter inspection they will be found there, as well as thereputed father of the Kabeiri--Vulcan, with his bolts and implements, havingnear him a king with a sceptre in his hand, which is the counterpart of that ofCheronaea, or the \"sceptre of Agamemnon,\" so-called, said to have been presentedto him by the lame god of Lemnos. In another place we find Vulcan, recognizableby his hammer and pincers, but under the shape of a monkey, as usuallyrepresented by the Egyptians. Now, if Nagkon-Wat is essentially a Buddhist temple, how comes it to have on itswalls basso-relievos of completely an Assyrian character; and Kabeirian godswhich, though universally worshipped as the most ancient of the Asiaticmystery-gods, had already been abandoned 200 years B.C., and the Samothracianmysteries themselves completely altered? Whence the popular tradition concerningthe Prince of Roma among the Cambodians, a personage mentioned by all the nativehistorians, who attribute to him the foundation of the temple? Is it not barelypossible that even the Ramayana, itself, the famous epic poem, is but theoriginal of Homer's Iliad, as it was suggested some years ago? The beautifulParis, carrying off Helen, looks very much like Ravana, king of the giants,eloping with Sita, Rama's wife? The Trojan war is a counterpart of the Ramayanawar; moreover, Herodotus assures us that the Trojan heroes and gods date inGreece only from the days of the Iliad. In such a case even Hanouma, themonkey-god, would be but Vulcan in disguise; the more so that the Cambodiantradition makes the founder of Angkor come from Roma, which they place at thewestern end of the world, and that the Hindu Roma also apportions the west tothe descendants of Hanouma. Hypothetical as the suggestion may now seem, it is worthy of consideration, ifeven for the sake of being refuted. The Abbe Jaquenet, a Catholic missionary inCochin China, ever ready to connect the least glimmer of historical light withthat of Christian revelation, writes, \"Whether we consider the commercialrelations of the Jews . . . when, in the height of their power, the combinedfleets of Hiram and Solomon went to seek the treasures of Ophir, or whether wecome lower down, to the dispersion of the ten tribes who, instead of returningfrom captivity, set out from the banks of the Euphrates, and reached the shoresof the ocean . . . the shining of the light of revelation in the far East is notthe less incontestable.\" It looks certainly \"incontestable\" enough if we reverse the position and admitthat all the light that ever shone on the Israelites came to them from this \"farEast,\" passing first through the Chaldeans and Egyptians. The first thing tosettle, is to find out who were the Israelites themselves; and that is the mostvital question. Many historians seem to claim, with good reason, that the Jewswere similar or identical with the ancient Phoenicians, but the Phoenicians werebeyond any doubt an Æthiopian race; moreover, the present race of Punjaub arehybridized with the Asiatic Æthiopians. Herodotus traces the Hebrews to thePersian Gulf; and south of that place were the Himyarites (the Arabians);beyond, the early Chaldeans and Susinians, the great builders. This seems toestablish pretty well their AEthiopian affinity. Megasthenes says that the Jewswere an Indian sect called Kalani, and their theology resembled that of theIndians. Other authors also suspect that the colonized Jews or the Judeans werethe Yadus from Afghanistan--the old India. * Eusebius tells us that \"theAEthiopians came from the river Indus and settled near Egypt.\" More research mayshow that the Tamil Hindus, who are accused by the missionaries of worshippingthe Devil--Kutti-Sattan--only honor, after all, Seth or Satan, worshipped by thebiblical Hittites. But if the Jews were in the twilight of history the Phoenicians, the latter maybe traced themselves to the nations who used the old Sanscrit language. Carthagewas a Phoenician city, hence its name; for Tyre was equally Kartha. In the Biblethe words Kir, Kirjath are frequently found. Their tutelar god was styledMel-Kartha (Mel, Baal), or tutelar lord of the city. In Sanscrit a city orcommunal was a cul and its lord was Heri. ** Her-culeus is therefore thetranslation of Melkarth and Sanscrit in origin. Moreover all the Cyclopean raceswere Phoenicians. In the Odyssey the Kuklopes (Cyclops) are the Libyanshepherds; and Herodotus describes them as miners and great builders. They arethe ancient Titans or giants, who in Hesiod forge bolts for Zeus. They are thebiblical Zamzummim from the land of the giants, the Anakim. Now it is easy to see that the excavators of Ellora, the builders of the oldPagodas, the architects of Copan and of the ruins of Central America, those ofNagkon-Wat, and those of the Egyptian remains were, if not of the same race, atleast of the same religion--the one taught in the oldest Mysteries. Besides, thefigures on the walls of Angkor are purely archaic, and have nothing to do withthe images and idols of Buddha, who may be of a far later origin. \"What gives apeculiar interest to this section,\" says Dr. Bastian, \"is the fact that theartist has represented the different nationalities in all their distinctivecharacteristic features, from the flat-nosed savage in the tasselled garb of thePnom and the short-haired Lao, to the straight-nosed Rajaput, with sword andshield, and the bearded Moor, giving a catalogue of nationalities, like anothercolumn of Trajan, in the predominant physical conformation of each race. On thewhole, there is such a prevalence of Hellenic cast in features and profiles, aswell as in the elegant attitude of the horsemen, that one might supposeXenocrates of old, after finishing his labors in Bombay, had made an excursionto the East.\" Therefore, if we allow the tribes of Israel to have had a hand in the buildingof Nagkon-Wat, it cannot be as the tribes numbered and sent from the wildernessof Paran in search of the land of Canaan, but as their earlier ancestors, whichamounts to the rejection of such tribes, as the casting of a reflection of theMosaic revelation. And where is the outside historical evidence that such tribeswere ever heard of at all, before the compilation of the Old Testament by Ezra?There are archaeologists who strongly regard the twelve tribes as utterlymythical, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_798] for therenever was a tribe of Simeon, and that of Levi was a caste. There still remainsthe same problem to solve--whether the Judaeans had ever been in Palestinebefore Cyrus. From the sons of Jacob, who had all married Canaanites, exceptJoseph, whose wife was the daughter of an Egyptian Priest of the Sun, down tothe legendary Book of Judges there was an acknowledged general intermarryingbetween the said tribes and the idolatrous races: \"And the children of Israeldwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites,and Jebusites; and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave theirdaughters to their sons, and served their gods,\" says the third chapter ofJudges, \" . . . and the children of Israel forgat their God and served Baalim,and the groves.\" This Baal was Moloch, M'lch Karta, or Hercules. He wasworshipped wherever the Phoenicians went. How could the Israelites possibly keeptogether as tribes, while, on the authority of the Bible itself, wholepopulations were from year to year uprooted violently by Assyrian and otherconquerors? \"So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria untothis day. And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, andfrom Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities ofSamaria instead of the children of Israel\" (2 Kings, xvii. 23, 24). If the language of Palestine became in time Semitic, it is because of Assyrianinfluence; for Phoenicia had become a dependency as early as the days of Hiram,and the Phoenicians evidently changed their language from Hamitic to Semitic.Assyria was \"the land of Nimrod\" (from Nimr, spotted), and Nimrod was Bacchus,with his spotted leopard-skin. This leopard-skin is a sacred appendage of the\"Mysteries\"; it was used in the Eleusinian as well as in the Egyptian Mysteries;it is found sculptured on the basso-relievos of Central American ruins, coveringthe backs of the sacrificers; it is mentioned in the earliest speculations ofthe Brahmans on the meaning of their sacrificial prayers, the AytareyaBrahmanam. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu013.htm#fn_799] It is used inthe Agnishtoma, the initiation rites of the Soma Mystery. When the neophyte is\"to be born again,\" he is covered with a leopard-skin, out of which he emergesas from his mother's womb. The Kabeiri were also Assyrian gods. They haddifferent names; in the common language they were known as Jupiter and Bacchus,and sometimes as Achiochersus, Aschieros, Achiochersa, and Cadmillus; and eventhe true number of these deities was uncertain with the people. They had othernames in the \"sacred language,\" known but to the hierophants and priests; and\"it was not lawful to mention them.\" How is it then that we find them reproducedin their Samothracian \"postures\" on the walls of Nagkon-Wat? How is it againthat we find them pronounced--albeit slightly disfigured--as known in that samesacred language, by the populations of Siam, Thibet, and India? The name Kabeiri may be a derivation from [images/00008.jpg]Abir, great;[images/00009.jpg], Ebir, an astrologer, or [images/00010.jpg], Chabir, anassociate; and they were worshipped at Hebron, the city of the Anakes--thegiants. The name Abraham, according to Dr. Wilder, has \"a very Kabeirian look.\"The word Heber, or Gheber may be the etymological root of the Hebrews, asapplied to Nimrod and the Bible-giants of the sixth chapter of Genesis, but wemust seek for their origin far earlier than the days of Moses. The namePhoenician affords its own proof. They are called Φοινικες by Manetho, or Ph'Anakes, which shows that the Anakes or Anakim of Canaan, with whom the people ofIsrael, if not identical in race, had, by intermarriage, become entirelyabsorbed, were the Phoenicians, or the problematical Hyk-sos, as Manetho has it,and whom Josephus once declared were the direct ancestors of the Israelites.Therefore, it is in this jumble of contradictory opinions, authorities, andhistorical olla podrida that we must look for a solution of the mystery. So longas the origin of the Hyk-sos is not positively settled we can know nothingcertain of the Israelitish people who, either wittingly or otherwise, have mixedup their chronology and origin in such an inextricable tangle. But if theHyk-sos can be proved to have been the Pali-Shepherds of the Indus, whopartially removed to the East, and came over from the nomadic Aryan tribes ofIndia, then, perhaps, it would account for the biblical myths being so mixed upwith the Aryan and Asiatic Mystery-gods. As Dunlap says: \"The Hebrews came outof Egypt among the Canaanites; they need not be traced beyond the Exodus. Thatis their historical beginning. It was very easy to cover up this remote event bythe recital of mythical traditions, and to prefix to it an account of theirorigin in which the gods (patriarchs) should figure as their ancestors.\" But itis not their historical beginning which is the most vital question for the worldof science and theology. It is their religious beginning. And if we can trace itthrough the Hyk-sos--Phoenicians, the AEthiopian builders and theChaldeans--whether it is to the Hindus that the latter owe their learning, orthe Brahmans who owe it to the Chaldeans, we have the means in hand to traceevery so-called revealed dogmatical assertion in the Bible to its origin, whichwe have to search for in the twilight of history, and before the separation ofthe Aryan and Semitic families. And how can we do it better or more surely thanthrough means afforded us by archaeology? Picture-writing can be destroyed, butif it survives it cannot lie; and, if we find the same myths, ideas, and secretsymbols on monuments all over the world; and if, moreover, these monuments canbe shown to antedate the twelve \"chosen\" tribes, then we can unerringly showthat instead of being a direct divine revelation, it was but an incompleterecollection or tradition among a tribe which had been identified and mixed upfor centuries before the apparition of Abraham, with all the three greatworld-families; namely, the Aryan, Semitic, and Turanian nations, if so theymust be called. The Teraphim of Abram's father, Terah, the \"maker of images,\" were the Kabeirigods, and we see them worshipped by Micah, by the Danites, and others. *Teraphim were identical with the seraphim, and these were serpent-images, theorigin of which is in the Sanscrit sarpa (the serpent), a symbol sacred to allthe deities as a symbol of immortality. Kiyun, or the god Kivan, worshipped bythe Hebrews in the wilderness, is Siva, the Hindu, ** as well as Saturn. *** TheGreek story shows that Dardanus, the Arcadian, having received them as a dowry,carried them to Samothrace, and from thence to Troy; and they were worshippedfar before the days of glory of Tyre or Sidon, though the former had been built2760 B.C. From where did Dardanus derive them? It is an easy matter to assign an age to ruins on merely the external evidenceof probabilities; it is more difficult to prove it. Meanwhile the rock-works ofRuad, Perytus, Marathos, resemble those of Petra, Baalbek, and other AEthiopianworks, even externally. On the other hand the assertions of certainarchaeologists who find no resemblance between the temples of Central Americaand those of Egypt and Siam, leave the symbologist, acquainted with the secretlanguage of picture-writing, perfectly unconcerned. He sees the landmarks of oneand the same doctrine on all of these monuments, and reads their history andaffiliation in signs imperceptible to the uninitiated scientist. There aretraditions also; and one of these speaks of the last of the king-initiates--(whowere but rarely admitted to the higher orders of the Eastern Brotherhoods), whoreigned in 1670. This king of Siam was the one so ridiculed by the Frenchambassador, de la Loubere, as a lunatic who had been searching all his life forthe philosopher's stone. One of such mysterious landmarks is found in the peculiar structure of certainarches in the temples. The author of the Land of the White Elephant remarks ascurious, \"the absence of the keystone in the arches of the building, and theundecipherable inscriptions.\" In the ruins of Santa Cruz del Quiche an archedcorridor was found by Stephens, equally without a keystone. Describing thedesolate ruins of Palenque, and remarking that the arches of the corridors wereall built on this model, and the ceilings in this form, he supposes that \"thebuilders were evidently ignorant of the principles of the arch, and the supportwas made by stones lapping over as they rose; as at Ocosingo, and amongCyclopean remains in Greece and Italy.\" * In other buildings, though they belongto the same group, the traveller found the missing keystone, which is asufficient proof that its omission elsewhere was premeditated. May we not look for the solution of the mystery in the Masonic manual? Thekeystone has an esoteric meaning which ought to be, if it is not, wellappreciated by high Masons. The most important subterranean building mentionedin the description of the origin of Freemasonry, is the one built by Enoch. Thepatriarch is led by the Deity, whom he sees in a vision, into the nine vaults.After that, with the assistance of his son, Methuselah, he constructs in theland of Canaan, \"in the bowels of the mountain,\" nine apartments on the modelsthat were shown to him in the vision. Each was roofed with an arch, and the apexof each formed a keystone, having inscribed on it the mirific characters. Eachof the latter, furthermore, represented one of the nine names, traced incharacters emblematical of the attributes by which the Deity was, according toancient Freemasonry, known to the antediluvian brethren. Then Enoch constructedtwo deltas of the purest gold, and tracing two of the mysterious characters oneach, he placed one of them in the deepest arch, and the other entrusted toMethuselah, communicating to him, at the same time, other important secrets nowlost to Freemasonry. And so, among these arcane secrets, now lost to their modern successors, may befound also the fact that the keystones were used in the arches only in certainportions of the temples devoted to special purposes. Another similaritypresented by the architectural remains of the religious monuments of everycountry can be found in the identity of parts, courses, and measurements. Allthese buildings belong to the age of Hermes Trismegistus, and howevercomparatively modern or ancient the temple may seem, their mathematicalproportions are found to correspond with the Egyptian religious edifices. Thereis a similar disposition of court-yards, adyta, passages, and steps; hence,despite any dissimilarity in architectural style, it is a warrantable inferencethat like religious rites were celebrated in all. Says Dr. Stukely, concerningStonehenge: \"This structure was not erected upon any Roman measure, and this isdemonstrated by the great number of fractions which the measurement of eachpart, according to European scales, gives. On the contrary the figures becomeeven, as soon as we apply to it the measurement of the ancient cubit, which wascommon to the Hebrew children of Shem, as well as to the Phoenicians andEgyptians, children of Ham (?), and imitators of the monuments of unhewn andoracular stones.\" The presence of the artificial lakes, and their peculiar disposition on theconsecrated grounds, is also a fact of great importance. The lakes inside theprecincts of Karnak, and those enclosed in the grounds of Nagkon-Wat, and aroundthe temples in the Mexican Copan and Santa Cruz del Quiche, will be found topresent the same peculiarities. Besides possessing other significances the wholearea was laid out with reference to cyclic calculations. In the Druidicalstructures the same sacred and mysterious numbers will be found. The circle ofstones generally consists of either twelve, or twenty-one, or thirty-six. Inthese circles the centre place belongs to Assar, Azon, or the god in the circle,by whatever other name he might have been known. The thirteen Mexicanserpent-gods bear a distant relationship to the thirteen stones of the Druidicalruins. The [images/00011.jpg](Tau), and the astronomical cross of Egypt[images/00012.jpg]are conspicuous in several apertures of the remains ofPalenque. In one of the basso-relievos of the Palace of Palenque, on the westside, sculptured on a hieroglyphic, right under the seated figure, is a Tau. Thestanding figure, which leans over the first one, is in the act of covering itshead with the left hand with the veil of initiation; while it extends its rightwith the index and middle finger pointing to heaven. The position is preciselythat of a Christian bishop giving his blessing, or the one in which Jesus isoften represented while at the Last Supper. Even the Hindu elephant-headed god of wisdom (or magic learning), Ganesha, may be found amongthe stucco figures of the Mexican ruins. What explanation can the archaeologists, philologists--in short, the chosen hostof Academicians--give us? None whatever. At best they have but hypotheses, everyone of which is likely to be pulled down by its successor--a pseudo-truth,perhaps, like the first. The keys to the biblical miracles of old, and to thephenomena of modern days; the problems of psychology, physiology, and the many\"missing links\" which have so perplexed scientists of late, are all in the handsof secret fraternities. This mystery must be unveiled some day. But till thendark skepticism will constantly interpose its threatening, ugly shadow betweenGod's truths and the spiritual vision of mankind; and many are those who,infected by the mortal epidemic of our century--hopeless materialism--willremain in doubt and mortal agony as to whether, when man dies, he will liveagain, although the question has been solved by long bygone generations ofsages. The answers are there. They may be found on the time-worn granite pagesof cave-temples, on sphinxes, propylons, and obelisks. They have stood there foruntold ages, and neither the rude assault of time, nor the still ruder assaultof Christian hands, have succeeded in obliterating their records. All coveredwith the problems which were solved--who can tell? perhaps by the archaicforefathers of their builders--the solution follows each question; and this theChristian could not appropriate, for, except the initiates, no one hasunderstood the mystic writing. The key was in the keeping of those who knew howto commune with the invisible Presence, and who had received, from the lips ofmother Nature herself, her grand truths. And so stand these monuments like muteforgotten sentinels on the threshold of that unseen world, whose gates arethrown open but to a few elect. Defying the hand of Time, the vain inquiry of profane science, the insults ofthe revealed religions, they will disclose their riddles to none but thelegatees of those by whom they were entrusted with the MYSTERY. The cold, stonylips of the once vocal Memnon, and of these hardy sphinxes, keep their secretswell. Who will unseal them? Who of our modern, materialistic dwarfs andunbelieving Sadducees will dare to lift the VEIL OF ISIS? [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES516:* See vol. ii., chap. 8. 521:* J. M.

The Ramayana,giving the biography of this sacred monkey, relates that Hanouma was formerly apowerful chieftain, who being the greatest friend of Rama, helped him to findhis wife, Sitha, who had been carried off to Ceylon by Ravana, the mighty kingof the giants. After numerous adventures Hanouma was caught by the latter, whilevisiting the city of the giant as Rama's spy. For this crime Ravana had the poorHanouma's tail oiled and set on fire, and it was in extinguishing it that themonkey-god became so black in the face that neither himself nor his posteritycould ever get rid of the color. If we have to believe Hindu legends this sameHanouma was the progenitor of the Europeans; a tradition which, though strictlyDarwinian, hence, scientific, is by no means flattering to us. The legend statesthat for services rendered, Rama, the hero and demi-god, gave in marriage to themonkey-warriors of his army the daughters of the giants of Ceylon--theRakshasas--and granted them, moreover, as a dowry, all western parts of theworld. Repairing thence, the monkeys and their giant-wives lived happily and hada number of descendants. The latter are the present Europeans. Dravidian wordsare found in Western Europe, indicating that there was an original unity of raceand language between the populations. May it not be a hint that the traditionsare akin, of elfin and kobold races in Europe, and monkeys, actually cognatewith them in Hindustan? 564:*\"Incidents of Travels in Central America, etc.,\" vol. i., p. 105. 564:**They stand no more, for the obelisk alone was removed to Paris. 564:*** See \"The Land of the White Elephant,\" p. 221. 565:*The President of the Royal Geographical Society of Berlin. 565:** \"The Land of the White Elephant,\" p. 215. 567:*The Phoenician Dido is the feminine of David [images/00013.jpg].

The doctrine has grown up before itspersecutors \"as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground; it hath noform, nor comeliness . . . it is despised and rejected of men; and they hidtheir faces from it. . . . They esteemed him not.\" There need be no controversy as to whether this doctrine agrees or not with theiconoclastic tendency of the skeptics of our times. It agrees with truth andthat is enough. It would be idle to expect that it would be believed by itsdetractors and slanderers. But the tenacious vitality it exhibits all over theglobe, wherever there are a group of men to quarrel over it, is the best proofthat the seed planted by our fathers on \"the other side of the flood\" was thatof a mighty oak, not the spore of a mushroom theology. No lightning of humanridicule can fell to the ground, and no thunderbolts ever forged by the Vulcansof science are powerful enough to blast the trunk, or even scar the branches ofthis world-tree of KNOWLEDGE. We have but to leave unnoticed their letter that killeth, and catch the subtilespirit of their hidden wisdom, to find concealed in the Books of Hermes--be theythe model or the copy of all others--the evidences of a truth and philosophywhich we feel must be based on the eternal laws. We instinctively comprehendthat, however finite the powers of man, while he is yet embodied, they must bein close kinship with the attributes of an infinite Deity; and we become capableof better appreciating the hidden sense of the gift lavished by the Elohim onH'Adam: \"Behold, I have given you everything which is upon the face of all theearth . . . subdue it,\" and \"have dominion\" over ALL. Had the allegories contained in the first chapters of Genesis been betterunderstood, even in their geographical and historical sense, which involvenothing at all esoteric, the claims of its true interpreters, the kabalists,could hardly have been rejected for so long a time. Every student of the Biblemust be aware that the first and second chapters of Genesis could not haveproceeded from the same pen. They are evidently allegories and parables; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_804] for the two narratives ofthe creation and peopling of our earth diametrically contradict each other innearly every particular of order, time, place, and methods employed in theso-called creation. In accepting the narratives literally, and as a whole, welower the dignity of the unknown Deity. We drag him down to the level ofhumanity, and endow him with the peculiar personality of man, who needs the\"cool of the day\" to refresh him; who rests from his labors; and is capable ofanger, revenge, and even of using precautions against man, \"lest he put forthhis hand, and take also of the tree of life.\" (A tacit admission, by the way, onthe part of the Deity, that man could do it, if not prevented by sheer force.)But, in recognizing the allegorical coloring of the description of what may betermed historical facts, we find our feet instantly on firm ground. To begin with--the garden of Eden as a locality is no myth at all; it belongs tothose landmarks of history which occasionally disclose to the student that theBible is not all mere allegory. \"Eden, or the Hebrew }[images/00014.jpg]GAN-EDEN, meaning the park or the garden of Eden, is anarchaic name of the country watered by the Euphrates and its many branches, fromAsia and Armenia to the Erythraian Sea.\" ** In the Chaldean Book of Numbers, itslocation is designated in numerals, and in the cipher Rosicrucian manuscript,left by Count St. Germain, it is fully described. In the Assyrian Tablets, it isrendered gan-dunyas. \"Behold,\" say the [images/00015.jpg]Eloim of Genesis, \"theman is become as one of us.\" The Eloim may be accepted in one sense for gods orpowers, and taken in another one for the Aleim, or priests; the hierophantsinitiated into the good and the evil of this world; for there was a college ofpriests called the Aleim, while the head of their caste, or the chief of thehierophants, was known as Java Aleim. Instead of becoming a neophyte, andgradually obtaining his esoteric knowledge through a regular initiation, anAdam, or man, uses his intuitional faculties, and, prompted by theSerpent--Woman and matter--tastes of the Tree of Knowledge--the esoteric orsecret doctrine--unlawfully. The priests of Hercules, or Mel-Karth, the \"Lord\"of the Eden, all wore \"coats of skin.\" The text says: \"And Java Aleim, made forAdam and his wife [images/00016.jpg], \"CHITONUTH OUR.\" The first Hebrew word,chitun, is the Greek chiton. It became a Slavonic word by adoption from theBible, and means a coat, an upper garment. Though containing the same substratum of esoteric truth as every earlycosmogony, the Hebrew Scripture wears on its face the marks of its doubleorigin. Its Genesis is purely a reminiscence of the Babylonian captivity. Thenames of places, men, and even objects, can be traced from the original text tothe Chaldeans and the Akkadians, the progenitors and Aryan instructors of theformer. It is strongly contested that the Akkad tribes of Chaldea, Babylonia,and Assyria were in any way cognate with the Brahmans, of Hindustan; but thereare more proofs in favor of this opinion than otherwise. The Shemite, orAssyrian, ought, perchance, to have been called the Turanian, and the Mongolianshave been denominated Scyths. But if the Akkadians ever existed otherwise thanin the imagination of some philologists and ethnologists, they certainly wouldnever have been a Turanian tribe, as some Assyriologists have striven to make usbelieve. They were simply emigrants on their way to Asia Minor from India, thecradle of humanity, and their sacerdotal adepts tarried to civilize and initiatea barbarian people. Halevy proved the fallacy of the Turanian mania in regard tothe Akkadian people, whose very name has been changed a dozen times already; andother scientists have proved that the Babylonian civilization was neither bornnor developed in that country. It was imported from India, and the importerswere Brahmanical Hindus. It is the opinion of Professor A. Wilder, that if the Assyrians had been calledTuranians and the Mongolians Scyths, then, in such a case the wars of Iran andTuran, Zohak and Jemshid, or Yima, would have been fairly comprehended as thestruggle of the old Persians against the endeavors of the Assyrian satraps toconquer them, which ended in the overthrow of Nineveh; \"the spider weaving herweb in the palace of Afrasiab.\" * \"The Turanian of Prof. Muller and his school,\" adds our correspondent, \"wasevidently the savage and nomadic Caucasian, out of whom the Hamite or AEthiopianbuilders come; then the Shemites--perhaps a hybrid of Hamite and Aryan; andlastly the Aryan--Median, Persian, Hindu; and later, the Gothic and Slavicpeoples of Europe. He supposes the Celt to have been a hybrid, analogous to theAssyrians--between the Aryan invaders of Europe and the Iberic (probablyAEthiopic) population of Europe.\" In such a case he must admit the possibilityof our assertion that the Akkadians were a tribe of the earliest Hindus. Now,whether they were Brahmans, from the Brahmanic planisphere proper (40° northlatitude), or from India (Hindustan), or, again, from the India of Central Asia,we will leave to philologists of future ages to decide. An opinion which with us amounts to certitude, demonstrated by an inductivemethod of our own, which we are afraid will be but little appreciated by theorthodox methods of modern science, is based on what will appear to the lattermerely circumstantial evidence. For years we have repeatedly noticed that thesame esoteric truths were expressed in identical symbols and allegories incountries between which there had never been traced any historical affiliation.We have found the Jewish Kabala and the Bible repeating the Babylonian\"myths,\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_807] and theOriental and Chaldean allegories, given in form and substance in the oldestmanuscripts of the Siamese Talapoin (monks), and in the popular but oldesttraditions of Ceylon. In the latter place we have an old and valued acquaintance whom we have also metin other parts of the globe, a Pali scholar, and a native Cingalese, who has inhis possession a curious palm leaf, to which, by chemical processes, a timeproofdurability has been given, and an enormous conch, or rather one-half of aconch--for it has been split in two. On the leaf we saw the representation of agiant of Ceylonian antiquity and fame, blind, and pulling down--with hisoutstretched arms, which are embracing the four central pillars of a pagoda--thewhole temple on a crowd of armed enemies. His hair is long and reaches nearly tothe ground. We were informed by the possessor of this curious relic, that theblind giant was \"Somona, the Little\"; so called in contradistinction withSomona-Kadom, the Siamese saviour. Moreover, the Pali legend, in as importantparticulars, corresponds with that of the biblical Samson. The shell bore upon its pearly surface a pictorial engraving, divided in twocompartments, and the workmanship was far more artistic, as to conception andexecution, than the crucifixes and other religious trinkets carved out of thesame material in our days, at Jaffa and Jerusalem. In the first panel isrepresented Siva, with all his Hindu attributes, sacrificing his son--whetherthe \"only-begotten,\" or one of many, we never stopped to inquire. The victim islaid on a funeral pile, and the father is hovering in the air over him, with anuplifted weapon ready to strike; but the god's face is turned toward a jungle inwhich a rhinoceros has deeply buried its horn in a huge tree and is unable toextricate it. The adjoining panel, or division, represents the same rhinoceroson the pile with the weapon plunged in its side, and the intended victim--Siva'sson--free, and helping the god to kindle the fire upon the sacrificial altar. Now, we have but to remember that Siva and the Palentinian Baal, or Moloch, andSaturn are identical; that Abraham is held until the present day by theMahometan Arabs as Saturn in the Kaaba; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_808] that Abraham and Israelwere names of Saturn; ** [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_809]and that Sanchoniathon tells us that Saturn offered his only-begotten son as asacrifice to his father Ouranos, and even circumcised himself and forced all hishousehold and allies to do the same, ***[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_810] to trace unerringly thebiblical myth to its source. But this source is neither Phoenician, norChaldean; it is purely Indian, and the original of it may be found in theMaha-Bharata. But, whether Brahmanical or Buddhistical, it must certainly bemuch older than the Jewish Pentateuch, as compiled by Ezra after the Babyloniancaptivity, and revised by the Rabbis of the Great Synagogue. Therefore, we are bold enough to maintain our assertion against the opinion ofmany men of learning, whom, nevertheless, we consider far more learned thanourselves. Scientific induction is one thing, and knowledge of facts, howeverunscientific they may seem at first, is another. But science has discoveredenough to inform us that Sanscrit originals, of Nepaul, were translated byBuddhistic missionaries into nearly every Asiatic language. Likewise Palimanuscripts were translated into Siamese, and carried to Burmah and Siam; it iseasy, therefore, to account for the same religious legends and myths circulatingin all these countries. But Manetho tells us also of Pali shepherds whoemigrated westward; and when we find some of the oldest Ceylonic traditions inthe Chaldean Kabala and Jewish Bible, we must think that either Chaldeans orBabylonians had been in Ceylon or India, or the ancient Pali had the sametraditions as the Akkadians, whose origin is so uncertain. Suppose evenRawlinson to be right, and that the Akkadians did come from Armenia, he did nottrace them farther back. As the field is now opened for any kind of hypothesis,we submit that this tribe might as well have come to Armenia from beyond theIndus, following their way in the direction of the Caspian Sea--a part which wasalso India, once upon a time--and from thence to the Euxine. Or they might havecome originally from Ceylon by the same way. It has been found impossible tofollow, with any degree of certitude, the wanderings of these nomadic Aryantribes; hence we are left to judge from inference, and by comparing theiresoteric myths. Abraham himself, for all our scientists can know, might havebeen one of these Pali shepherds who emigrated West. He is shown to have gonewith his father, Terah, from \"Ur of the Chaldees\"; and Sir H. Rawlinson foundthe Phoenician city of Martu or Marathos mentioned in an inscription at Ur, andshows it to signify THE WEST. If their language seems in one sense to oppose their identity with the Brahmansof Hindustan, yet there are other reasons which make good our claims that thebiblical allegories of Genesis are entirely due to these nomadic tribes. Theirname Ak-ad, is of the same class as Ad-Am, Ha-va, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_811] or Ed-En--\"perhaps,\" saysDr. Wilder, \"meaning son of Ad, like the sons of Ad in ancient Arabia. InAssyrian, Ak is creator and Ad-ad is AD, the father.\" In Aramean Ad also meansone, and Ad-ad the only-one; and in the Kabala Ad-ant is the only-begotten, thefirst emanation of the unseen Creator. Adon was the \"Lord\" god of Syria and theconsort of Adar-gat, or Aster-'t,' the Syrian goddess, who was Venus, Isis,Istar, or Mylitta, etc.; and each of these was \"mother of all living\"--the MagnaMater. Thus, while the first, second, and third chapters of Genesis are but disfiguredimitations of other cosmogonies, the fourth chapter, beginning at the sixteenthverse, and the fifth chapter to the end--give purely historical facts; thoughthe latter were never correctly interpreted. They are taken, word for word, fromthe secret Book of Numbers, of the Great Oriental Kabala. From the birth ofEnoch, the appropriated first parent of modern Freemasonry, begins the genealogyof the so-called Turanian, Aryan, and Semitic families, if such they becorrectly. Every woman is an euhemerized land or city; every man and patriarch arace, a branch, or a subdivision of a race. The wives of Lamech give the key tothe riddle which some good scholar might easily master, even without studyingthe esoteric sciences. \"And Ad-ah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwellin tents, and of such as have cattle,\" nomadic Aryan race; \" . . . and hisbrother was Jubal; he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ; .. . and Zillah bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass andiron,\" etc. Every word has a significance; but it is no revelation. It is simplya compilation of the most historical facts, although history is too perplexedupon this point to know how to claim them. It is from the Euxine to Kashmere,and beyond that we must search for the cradle of mankind and the sons of Ad-ah;and leave the particular garden of Ed-en on the Euphrates to the college of theweird astrologers and magi, the Aleim. *No wonder that the Northern seer,Swedenborg, advises people to search for the LOST WORD among the hierophants ofTartary, China, and Thibet; for it is there, and only there now, although wefind it inscribed on the monuments of the oldest Egyptian dynasties. The grandiose poetry of the four Vedas; the Books of Hermes; the Chaldean Bookof Numbers; the Nazarene Codex; the Kabala of the Tanaim; the Sepher Jezira; theBook of Wisdom, of Schlomah (Solomon); the secret treatise on Muhta and Badha **attributed by the Buddhist kabalists to Kapila, the founder of the Sankhyasystem; the Brahmanas; *** the Stan-gyour, **** of the Thibetans; all thesevolumes have the same ground-work. Varying but in allegories they teach the samesecret doctrine which, when once thoroughly eliminated, will prove to be theUltima Thule of true philosophy, and disclose what is this LOST WORD. It is useless to expect scientists to find in these works anything of interestexcept that which is in direct relation to either philology or comparativemythology. Even Max Muller, as soon as he refers to the mysticism andmetaphysical philosophy scattered through the old Sanscrit literature, sees init naught but \"theological absurdities\" and \"fantastic nonsense.\" Speaking of the Brahmanas, all full of mysterious, therefore, as a matter ofcourse, absurd, meanings, we find him saying: \"The greater portion of them issimply twaddle, and what is worse, theological twaddle. No person who is notacquainted beforehand with the place which the Brahmanas fill in the history ofthe Indian mind, could read more than ten pages without being disgusted.\" ***** We do not wonder at the severe criticism of this erudite scientist.Without aclew to the real meaning of this \"twaddle\" of religious conceptions, how canthey judge of the esoteric by the exoteric? We find an answer in another of thehighly-interesting lectures of the German savant: \"No Jew, no Roman, no Brahmanever thought of converting people to his own national form of worship. Religionwas looked upon as private or national property. It was to be guarded againststrangers. The most sacred names of the gods, the prayers by which their favorcould be gained, were kept secret. No religion was more exclusive than that ofthe Brahmans.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_817] Therefore, when we find scholars who imagine, because they have learned themeaning of a few exoteric rites from a srotriya, a Brahman priest initiated inthe sacrificial mysteries, that they are capable of interpreting all thesymbols, and have sifted the Hindu religions, we cannot help admiring thecompleteness of their scientific delusions. The more so, since we find MaxMuller himself asserting that since \"a Brahman was born--nay, twice-born, andcould not be made, not even the lowest caste, that of the Sudras, would open itsranks to a stranger.\" How much less likely that he would allow that stranger tounveil to the world his most sacred religious Mysteries, the secret of which hasbeen guarded so jealously from profanation throughout untold ages. No; our scientists do not--nay, cannot understand correctly the old Hinduliterature, any more than an atheist or materialist is able to appreciate attheir just value the feelings of a seer, a mystic, whose whole life is given tocontemplation. They have a perfect right to soothe themselves with the sweetlullaby of their self-admiration, and the just consciousness of their greatlearning, but none at all to lead the world into their own error, by making itbelieve that they have solved the last problem of ancient thought in literature,whether Sanscrit or any other; that there lies not behind the external \"twaddle\"far more than was ever dreamed of by our modern exact philosophy; or that aboveand beyond the correct rendering of Sanscrit words and sentences there is nodeeper thought, intelligible to some of the descendants of those who veiled itin the morning hours of earth's day, if they are not to the profane reader. We do not feel in the least astonished that a materialist, and even an orthodoxChristian, is unable to read either the old Brahmanical works or their progeny,the Kabala, the Codex of Bardesanes, or the Jewish Scripture without disgust attheir immodesty and apparent lack of what the uninitiated reader is pleased tocall \"common sense.\" But if we can hardly blame them for such a feeling,especially in the case of the Hebrew, and even the Greek and Latin literature,and are quite ready to agree with Professor Fiske that \"it is a mark of wisdomto be dissatisfied with imperfect evidence\"; on the other hand we have a rightto expect that they should recognize that it is no less a mark of honesty toconfess one's ignorance in cases where there are two sides to the question, andin the solution of which the scientist may as easily blunder as any ignoramus.When we find Professor Draper, in his definition of periods in the IntellectualDevelopment of Europe, classifying the time from the days of Socrates, theprecursor and teacher of Plato, to Karneades, as \"the age of faith\"; and thatfrom Philo to the destruction of the Neo-platonic schools by Justinian--the \"ageof decrepitude,\" we may be allowed to infer that the learned professor knows aslittle about the real tendency of Greek philosophy and the Attic schools as heunderstood the true character of Giordano Bruno. So when we see one of the bestof Sanscrit scholars stating on his own unsupported authority that the \"greaterportion of the Brahmanas is simply theological twaddle,\" we deeply regret tothink that Professor Muller must be far better acquainted with the old Sanscritverbs and nouns than with Sanscrit thought; and that a scholar so uniformlydisposed to do justice to the religions and the men of old should so effectuallyplay into the hands of Christian theologians. \"What is the use of Sanscrit?\"exclaims Jacquemont, who alone has made more false statements about the Eastthan all the Orientalists put together. At such a rate there would be noneindeed. If we are to exchange one corpse for another, then we may as welldissect the dead letter of the Jewish Bible as that of the Vedas. He who is notintuitionally vivified by the religious spirit of old, will never see beyond theexoteric \"twaddle.\" When first we read that \"in the cavity of the cranium of Macroprosopos--theLong-Face--lies hidden the aerial WISDOM which nowhere is opened; and it is notdiscovered, and not opened\"; or again, that \"the nose of the 'ancient of days'is Life in every part\"; we are inclined to regard it as the incoherent ravingsof a lunatic. And when, moreover, we are apprized by the Codex Nazaraeus that\"she, the Spiritus,\" invites her son Karabtanos, \"who is frantic and withoutjudgment,\" to an unnatural crime with his own mother, we are pretty welldisposed to throw the book aside in disgust. But is this only meaningless trash,expressed in rude and even obscene language? No more can it be judged byexternal appearance than the sexual symbols of the Egyptian and Hindu religions,or the coarse frankness of expression of the \"holy\" Bible itself. No more thanthe allegory of Eve and the tempting serpent of Eden. The ever-insinuating,restless spirit, when once it \"falls into matter,\" tempts Eve, or Hava, whichbodily represent chaotic matter \"frantic and without judgment.\" For matter,Karabtanos, is the son of Spirit, or the Spiritus of the Nazarenes, theSophia-Achamoth, and the latter is the daughter of the pure, intellectualspirit, the divine breath. When science shall have effectually demonstrated tous the origin of matter, and proved the fallacy of the occultists and oldphilosophers who held (as their descendants now hold) that matter is but one ofthe correlations of spirit, then will the world of skeptics have a right toreject the old Wisdom, or throw the charge of obscenity in the teeth of the oldreligions. \"From time immemorial,\" *says Mrs. Lydia Maria Child, \"an emblem has beenworshipped in Hindustan as the type of creation, or the origin of life. It isthe most common symbol of Siva [Bala, or Maha-Deva], and is universallyconnected with his worship. . . . Siva was not merely the reproducer of humanforms; he represented the fructifying principle, the generative power thatpervades the universe. . . . Small images of this emblem carved in ivory, gold,or crystal, are worn as ornaments about the neck. . . . The maternal emblem islikewise a religious type; and worshippers of Vishnu represent it on theirforehead by a horizontal mark. . . . Is it strange that they regarded withreverence the great mystery of human birth? Were they impure thus to regard it?Or are we impure that we do not so regard it? We have travelled far, and uncleanhave been the paths, since those old Anchorites first spoke of God and the soulin the solemn depths of their first sanctuaries. Let us not smile at their modeof tracing the infinite and incomprehensible Cause throughout all the mysteriesof nature, lest by so doing we cast the shadow of our own grossness on theirpatriarchal simplicity.\" Many are the scholars who have tried, to the best of their ability, to dojustice to old India. Colebrooke, Sir William Jones, Barthelemy St. Hilaire,Lassen, Weber, Strange, Burnouf, Hardy, and finally Jacolliot, have all broughtforward their testimony to her achievements in legislation, ethics, philosophy,and religion. No people in the world have ever attained to such a grandeur ofthought in ideal conceptions of the Deity and its offspring, MAN, as theSanscrit metaphysicians and theologians. \"My complaint against many translatorsand Orientalists,\" says Jacolliot, \"while admiring their profound knowledge is,that not having lived in India, they fail in exactness of expression and incomprehension of the symbolical sense of poetic chants, prayers, and ceremonies,and thus too often fall into material errors, whether of translation orappreciation.\" ** [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_819] Further,this author who, from a long residence in India, and the study of itsliterature, is better qualified to testify than those who have never been there,tells us that \"the life of several generations would scarce suffice merely toread the works that ancient India has left us on history, ethics (morale),poetry, philosophy, religion, different sciences, and medicine.\" And yet LouisJacolliot is able to judge but by the few fragments, access to which had everdepended on the complaisance and friendship of a few Brahmans with whom hesucceeded in becoming intimate. Did they show him all their treasures? Did theyexplain to him all he desired to learn? We doubt it, otherwise he would nothimself have judged their religious ceremonies so hastily as he has upon severaloccasions merely upon circumstantial evidence. Still, no traveller has shown himself fairer in the main or more impartial toIndia than Jacolliot. If he is severe as to her present degradation, he is stillseverer to those who were the cause of it--the sacerdotal caste of the last fewcenturies--and his rebuke is proportionate to the intensity of his appreciationof her past grandeur. He shows the sources whence proceeded the revelations ofall the ancient creeds, including the inspired Books of Moses, and points atIndia directly as the cradle of humanity, the parent of all other nations, andthe hot-bed of all the lost arts and sciences of antiquity, for which old India,herself, was lost already in the Cimmerian darkness of the archaic ages. \"Tostudy India,\" he says, \"is to trace humanity to its sources.\" \"In the same way as modern society jostles antiquity at each step,\" he adds, \"asour poets have copied Homer and Virgil, Sophocles and Euripides, Plautus andTerence; as our philosophers have drawn inspiration from Socrates, Pythagoras,Plato, and Aristotle; as our historians take Titus Livius, Sallust, or Tacitus,as models; our orators, Demosthenes or Cicero; our physicians study Hippocrates,and our codes transcribe Justinian--so had antiquity's self also an antiquity tostudy, to imitate, and to copy. What more simple and more logical? Do notpeoples precede and succeed each other? Does the knowledge, painfully acquiredby one nation, confine itself to its own territory, and die with the generationthat produced it? Can there be any absurdity in the suggestion that the India of6,000 years ago, brilliant, civilized, overflowing with population, impressedupon Egypt, Persia, Judea, Greece, and Rome, a stamp as ineffaceable,impressions as profound, as these last have impressed upon us? \"It is time to disabuse ourselves of those prejudices which represent theancients as having almost spontaneously-elaborated ideas, philosophic,religious, and moral, the most lofty--those prejudices that in their naiveadmiration explain all in the domain of science, arts, and letters, by theintuition of some few great men, and in the realm of religion by revelation.\" * We believe that the day is not far off when the opponents of this fine anderudite writer will be silenced by the force of irrefutable evidence. And whenfacts shall once have corroborated his theories and assertions, what will theworld find? That it is to India, the country less explored, and less known thanany other, that all the other great nations of the world are indebted for theirlanguages, arts, legislature, and civilization. Its progress, impeded for a fewcenturies before our era--for, as this writer shows, at the epoch of the greatMacedonian conqueror, \"India had already passed the period of her splendor\"--wascompletely stifled in the subsequent ages. But the evidence of her past glorieslies in her literature. What people in all the world can boast of such aliterature, which, were the Sanscrit less difficult, would be more studied thannow? Hitherto the general public has had to rely for information on a fewscholars who, notwithstanding their great learning and trustworthiness, areunequal to the task of translating and commenting upon more than a few books outof the almost countless number that, notwithstanding the vandalism of themissionaries, are still left to swell the mighty volume of Sanscrit literature.And to do even so much is the labor of a European's lifetime. Hence, peoplejudge hastily, and often make the most ridiculous blunders. Quite recently a certain Reverend Dunlop Moore, of New Brighton, Pa., determinedto show his cleverness and piety at a single stroke, attacked the statement madeby a Theosophist in a discourse delivered at the cremation of Baron de Palm,that the Code of Manu existed a thousand years before Moses. \"All Orientalistsof any note,\" he says, \"are now agreed that the Institutes of Manu were writtenat different times. The oldest part of the collection probably dates from thesixth century before the Christian era.\" * Whatever other Orientalists,encountered by this Pennsylvania pundit, may think, Sir William Jones is of adifferent opinion. \"It is clear,\" he says, \"that the Laws of Manu, such as wepossess them, and which comprise but 680 slokas, cannot be the work attributedto Soumati, which is probably that described under the name of Vriddha Manava,or Ancient Code of Manu, which has not yet been entirely reconstructed, althoughmany passages of the book have been preserved by tradition, and are often citedby commentators.\" \"We read in the preface to a treatise on legislation by Narada,\" says Jacolliot,\"written by one of his adepts, a client of Brahmanical power: 'Manu havingwritten the laws of Brahma, in 100,000 slokas, or distichs, which formedtwenty-four books and a thousand chapters, gave the work to Narada, the sage ofsages, who abridged it for the use of mankind to 12,000 verses, which he gave toa son of Brighou, named Soumati, who, for the greater convenience of man,reduced them to 4,000.' \" Here we have the opinion of Sir William Jones, who, in 1794, affirmed that thefragments in possession of the Europeans could not be The Ancient Code of Manu,and that of Louis Jacolliot, who, in 1868, after consulting all the authorities,and adding to them the result of his own long and patient research, writes thefollowing: \"The Hindu laws were codified by Manu more than 3,000 years beforethe Christian era, copied by the whole of antiquity, and notably by Rome, whichalone has left us a written law--the Code of Justinian; which has been adoptedas the basis of all modern legislations.\" * In another volume, entitled Christna et le Christ, in a scientific arraignmentof a pious, albeit very learned Catholic antagonist, M. Textor de Ravisi, whoseeks to prove that the orthography of the name Christna is not warranted by itsSanscrit spelling--and has the worst of it--Jacolliot remarks: \"We know that thelegislator Manu is lost in the night of the ante-historical period of India; andthat no Indianist has dared to refuse him the title of the most ancientlaw-giver in the world\" (p. 350). But Jacolliot had not heard of the Rev. Dunlop Moore. This is why, perhaps, heand several other Indiologists are preparing to prove that many of the Vedictexts, as well as those of Manu, sent to Europe by the Asiatic Society ofCalcutta, are not genuine texts at all, but mostly due to the cunning tentativeefforts of certain Jesuit missionaries to mislead science, by the help ofapocryphal works calculated at once to throw upon the history of ancient India acloud of uncertainty and darkness, and on the modern Brahmans and pundits asuspicion of systematical interpolation. \"These facts,\" he adds, \"which are sowell established in India that they are not even brought in question, must berevealed to Europe\" (Christna et le Christ, p. 347). Moreover, the Code of Manu, known to European Orientalists as that one which iscommented upon by Brighou, does not even form a part of the ancient Manu calledthe Vriddha-Manava. Although but small fragments of it have been discovered byour scientists, it does exist as a whole in certain temples; and Jacolliotproves that the texts sent to Europe disagree entirely with the same texts asfound in the pagodas of Southern India. We can also cite for our purpose SirWilliam Jones, who, complaining of Callouca, remarks that the latter seems inhis commentaries to have never considered that \"the laws of Manu are restrictedto the first three ages\" (Translation of Manu and Commentaries). According to computation we are now in the age of Kali-Yug, the third, reckoningfrom that of Satya or Kritayug, first age in which Hindu tradition establishesthe laws of Manu, and the authenticity of which Sir William Jones implicitlyaccepted. Admitting all that may be said as to the enormous exaggerations ofHindu chronology--which, by the bye, dovetails far better with modern geologyand anthropology than the 6,000 years' caricature chronology of the JewishScripture--still as about 4,500 years have elapsed since the fourth age of theworld, or Kali-Yug, began, we have here a proof that one of the greatestOrientalists that ever lived--and a Christian in the bargain, not aTheosophist--believed that Manu is many thousand years older than Moses. Clearlyone of two things should happen: Either Indian history should be remodelled forthe Presbyterian Banner, or the writers for that sheet should study Hinduliterature before trying their hand again at criticism of Theosophists. But apart from the private opinions of these reverend gentlemen whose views verylittle concern us, we find even in the New American Cyclopaedia a decidedtendency to dispute the antiquity and importance of the Hindu literature. TheLaws of Manu, says one of the writers, \"do not date earlier than the thirdcentury B.C.\" This term is a very elastic one. If by the Laws of Manu the writermeans the abridgment of these laws, compiled and arranged by later Brahmans toserve as an authority for their ambitious projects, and with an idea of creatingfor themselves a rule of domination, then, in such a sense, they may be right,though we are prepared to dispute even that. At all events it is as littleproper to pass off this abridgment for the genuine old laws codified by Manu, asto assert that the Hebrew Bible does not date earlier than the tenth century ofour era, because we have no Hebrew manuscript older than that, or that the poemsof Homer's Iliad were neither known nor written before its first authenticatedmanuscript was found. There is no Sanscrit manuscript in the possession ofEuropean scholars much older than four or five centuries, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_823] a fact which did not inthe least restrain them from assigning to the Vedas an antiquity of between fouror five thousand years. There are the strongest possible arguments in favor ofthe great antiquity of the Books of Manu, and without going to the trouble ofquoting the opinions of various scholars, no two of whom agree, we will bringforward our own, at least as regards this most unwarranted assertion of theCyclopaedia. If, as Jacolliot proves, text in hand, the Code of Justinian was copied from theLaws of Manu, we have first of all to ascertain the age of the former; not as awritten and perfect code, but its origin. To answer, is not difficult webelieve. According to Varro, Rome was built in 3961 of the Julian period (754 B.C.). TheRoman Law, as embodied by order of Justinian, and known as the Corpus JurisCivilis, was not a code, we are told, but a digest of the customs of legislationof many centuries. Though nothing is actually known of the original authorities,the chief source from which the jus scriptum, or written law, was derived, wasthe jus non scriptum, or the law of custom. Now it is just on this law of customthat we are prepared to base our arguments. The law of the twelve tables,moreover, was compiled about A.U.C. 300, and even this as respects private lawwas compiled from still earlier sources. Therefore, if these earlier sources arefound to agree so well with the Laws of Manu, which the Brahmans claim to havebeen codified in the Kritayug, an age anterior to the actual Kali-yug, then wemust suppose that this source of the \"Twelve Tables,\" as laws of custom andtradition, are at least, by several hundred years, older than their copyists.This, alone, carries us right back to more than 1,000 years B.C. The Manava Dharma Sastra, embodying the Hindu system of cosmogony, is recognizedas next to the Vedas in antiquity; and even Colebrooke assigns the latter to thefifteenth century B.C. And, now, what is the etymology of the name of ManavaDharma Sastra? It is a word compounded of Manu; d'harma, institute; and sastra,command or law. How then can Manu's laws date only since the third centurybefore our Christian era? The Hindu Code had never laid any claims to be divinely revealed. Thedistinction made by the Brahmans themselves between the Vedas and every othersacred book of however respectable an antiquity, is a proof of it. While everysect holds the Vedas as the direct word of God--sruti (revelation)--the Code ofManu is designated by them simply as the smriti, a collection of oraltraditions. Still these traditions, or \"recollections,\" are among the oldest aswell as the most revered in the land. But, perhaps, the strongest argument infavor of its antiquity, and the general esteem in which it is held, lies in thefollowing fact. The Brahmans have undeniably remodelled these traditions at somedistant period, and made many of the actual laws, as they now stand in the Codeof Manu, to answer their ambitious views. Therefore, they must have done it at atime when the burning of widows (suttee) was neither practiced nor intended tobe, which it has been for nearly 2,500 years. No more than in the Vedas is thereany such atrocious law mentioned in the Code of Manu! Who, unless he iscompletely unacquainted with the history of India, but knows that this countrywas once on the verge of a religious rebellion occasioned by the prohibition ofsuttee by the English government? The Brahmans appealed to a verse from theRig-Veda which commanded it. But this verse has been recently proved to havebeen falsified. * Had the Brahmans been the sole authors of the Code of Manu, orhad they codified it entirely instead of simply filling it with interpolationsto answer their object not earlier than the time of Alexander, how is itpossible that they would have neglected this most important point, and soimperilled its authority? This fact alone proves that the Code must be countedone of their most ancient books. It is on the strength of such circumstantial evidence--that of reason andlogic--that we affirm that, if Egypt furnished Greece with her civilization, andthe latter bequeathed hers to Rome, Egypt herself had, in those unknown ageswhen Menes reigned, ** received her laws, her social institutions, her arts andher sciences, from pre-Vedic India; *** and that therefore, it is in that oldinitiation of the priests--adepts of all the other countries--we must seek forthe key to the great mysteries of humanity. And when we say, indiscriminately, \"India,\" we do not mean the India of ourmodern days, but that of the archaic period. In those ancient times countrieswhich are now known to us by other names were all called India. There was anUpper, a Lower, and a Western India, the latter of which is now Persia-Iran. Thecountries now named Thibet, Mongolia, and Great Tartary, were also considered bythe ancient writers as India. We will now give a legend in relation to thoseplaces which science now fully concedes to have been the cradle of humanity. Tradition says, and the records of the Great Book explain, that long before thedays of Ad-am, and his inquisitive wife, He-va, where now are found but saltlakes and desolate barren deserts, there was a vast inland sea, which extendedover Middle Asia, north of the proud Himalayan range, and its westernprolongation. An island, which for its unparalleled beauty had no rival in theworld, was inhabited by the last remnant of the race which preceded ours. Thisrace could live with equal ease in water, air, or fire, for it had an unlimitedcontrol over the elements. These were the \"Sons of God\"; not those who saw thedaughters of men, but the real Elohim, though in the Oriental Kabala they haveanother name. It was they who imparted Nature's most weird secrets to men, andrevealed to them the ineffable, and now lost \"word.\" This word, which is no word, has travelled once around the globe, and stilllingers as a far-off dying echo in the hearts of some privileged men. Thehierophants of all the Sacerdotal Colleges were aware of the existence of thisisland, but the \"word\" was known only to the Java Aleim, or chief lord of everycollege, and was passed to his successor only at the moment of death. There weremany such colleges, and the old classic authors speak of them. We have already seen that it is one of the universal traditions accepted by allthe ancient peoples that there were many races of men anterior to our presentraces. Each of these was distinct from the one which preceded it; and eachdisappeared as the following appeared. In Manu, six such races are plainlymentioned as having succeeded each other. \"From this Manu Swayambhouva (the minor, and answering to Adam Kadmon) issuedfrom Swayambhouva, or the Being existing through himself, descended six otherManus (men typifying progenitors), each of whom gave birth to a race of men. . .. These Manus, all powerful, of whom Swayambhouva is the first, have each, inhis period--antara--produced and directed this world composed of movable andunmovable beings\" (Manu, book i.). In the Siva-Purana, * it runs thus: \"O Siva, thou god of fire, mayest thou destroy my sins, as the bleaching-grassof the jungle is destroyed by fire. It is through thy mighty Breath that Adhima(the first man) and Heva (completion of life, in Sanscrit), the ancestors ofthis race of men have received life and covered the world with theirdescendants.\" There was no communication with the fair island by sea, but subterraneanpassages known only to the chiefs, communicated with it in all directions.Tradition points to many of the majestic ruins of India, Ellora, Elephanta, andthe caverns of Ajunta (Chandor range), which belonged once to those colleges,and with which were connected such subterranean ways. ** Who can tell but thelost Atlantis--which is also mentioned in the Secret Book, but, again, underanother name, pronounced in the sacred language--did not exist yet in thosedays? The great lost continent might have, perhaps, been situated south of Asia,extending from India to Tasmania? * If the hypothesis now so much doubted, andpositively denied by some learned authors who regard it as a joke of Plato's, isever verified, then, perhaps, will the scientists believe that the descriptionof the god-inhabited continent was not altogether fable. And they may thenperceive that Plato's guarded hints and the fact of his attributing thenarrative to Solon and the Egyptian priests, were but a prudent way of impartingthe fact to the world and by cleverly combining truth and fiction, to disconnecthimself from a story which the obligations imposed at initiation forbade him todivulge. And how could the name of Atlanta itself originate with Plato at all? Atlante isnot a Greek name, and its construction has nothing of the Grecian element in it.Brasseur de Bourbourg tried to demonstrate it years ago, and Baldwin, in hisPrehistoric Nations and Ancient America, cites the former, who declares that\"the words Atlas and Atlantic have no satisfactory etymology in any languageknown in Europe. They are not Greek, and cannot be referred to any knownlanguage of the Old World. But in the Nahuatl (or Toltec) language we findimmediately the radical a, atl, which signifies water, war, and the top of thehead. From this comes a series of words, such as atlan, or the border of or amidthe water; from which we have the adjective Atlantic. We have also atlaca, tocombat. . . . A city named Atlan existed when the continent was discovered byColumbus, at the entrance of the Gulf of Uraha, in Darien, with a good harbor.It is now reduced to an unimportant pueblo (village) named Aclo.\" ** Is it not, to say the least, very extraordinary to find in America a city calledby a name which contains a purely local element, foreign moreover to every othercountry, in the alleged fiction of a philosopher of 400 years B.C.? The same maybe said of the name of America, which may one day be found more closely relatedto Meru, the sacred mount in the centre of the seven continents, according tothe Hindu tradition, than to Americus Vespucius, whose name by the bye, wasnever Americus at all, but Albericus, a trifling difference not deemed worthmentioning till very lately by exact history. ***We adduce the following reasonsin favor of our argument: 1st. Americ, Amerrique, or Amerique is the name in Nicaragua for the high landor mountain range that lies between Juigalpa and Libertad, in the province ofChontales, and which reaches on the one side into the country of the CarcasIndians, and on the other side into the country of the Ramas Indians. Ic or ique, as a terminal, means great, as cazique, etc. Columbus mentions, in his fourth voyage, the village Cariai, probably Caicai.The people abounded with sorcerers, or medicine men; and this was the region ofthe Americ range, 3,000 feet high. Yet he omits to mention this word. The name America Provincia, first appeared on a map published at Basle, in 1522.Till that time, the region was believed to be part of India. That year Nicaraguawas conquered by Gil Gonzales de Avida. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_832] 2d. \"The Northmen who visited the continent in the tenth century, ** a low levelcoast thickly covered with wood,\" called it Markland, from mark, a wood. The rhad a rolling sound as in marrick. A similar word is found in the country of theHimalayas, and the name of the World-Mountain, Meru, is pronounced in somedialects as MERUAH, the letter h being strongly aspirated. The main idea is,however, to show how two peoples could possibly accept a word of similar sound,each having used it in their own sense, and finding it applied to the sameterritory. \"It is most plausible,\" says Professor Wilder, \"that the State of CentralAmerica, where we find the name Americ signifying (like the Hindu Meru we mayadd) great mountain, gave the continent its name. Vespucius would have used hissurname if he had designed to give a title to a continent. If the Abbe deBourbourg's theory of Atlan as the source of Atlas and Atlantic is verified, thetwo hypotheses could agree most charmingly. As Plato was not the only writerthat treated of a world beyond the pillars of Hercules, and as the ocean isstill shallow and grows sea-weed all through the tropical part of the Atlantic,it is not wild to imagine that this continent projected, or that there was anisland-world on that coast. The Pacific also shows signs of having been apopulous island-empire of Malays or Javanese--if not a continent amid the Northand South. We know that Lemuria in the Indian Ocean is a dream of scientists;and that the Sahara and the middle belt of Asia were perhaps once sea-beds.\" To continue the tradition, we have to add that the class of hierophants wasdivided into two distinct categories: those who were instructed by the \"Sons ofGod,\" of the island, and who were initiated in the divine doctrine of purerevelation, and others who inhabited the lost Atlantis--if such must be itsname--and who, being of another race, were born with a sight which embraced allhidden things, and was independent of both distance and material obstacle. Inshort, they were the fourth race of men mentioned in the Popol-Vuh, whose sightwas unlimited and who knew all things at once. They were, perhaps, what we wouldnow term \"natural-born mediums,\" who neither struggled nor suffered to obtaintheir knowledge, nor did they acquire it at the price of any sacrifice.Therefore, while the former walked in the path of their divine instructors, andacquiring their knowledge by degrees, learned at the same time to discern theevil from the good, the born adepts of the Atlantis blindly followed theinsinuations of the great and invisible \"Dragon,\" the King Thevetat (the Serpentof Genesis?). Thevetat had neither learned nor acquired knowledge, but, toborrow an expression of Dr. Wilder in relation to the tempting Serpent, he was\"a sort of Socrates who knew without being initiated.\" Thus, under the evilinsinuations of their demon, Thevetat, the Atlantis-race became a nation ofwicked magicians. In consequence of this, war was declared, the story of whichwould be too long to narrate; its substance may be found in the disfiguredallegories of the race of Cain, the giants, and that of Noah and his righteousfamily. The conflict came to an end by the submersion of the Atlantis; whichfinds its imitation in the stories of the Babylonian and Mosaic flood: Thegiants and magicians \" . . . and all flesh died . . . and every man.\" All exceptXisuthrus and Noah, who are substantially identical with the great Father of theThlinkithians in the Popol-Vuh, or the sacred book of the Guatemaleans, whichalso tells of his escaping in a large boat, like the Hindu Noah--Vaiswasvata. If we believe the tradition at all, we have to credit the further story thatfrom the intermarrying of the progeny of the hierophants of the island and thedescendants of the Atlantian Noah, sprang up a mixed race of righteous andwicked. On the one side the world had its Enochs, Moseses, Gautama-Buddhas, itsnumerous \"Saviours,\" and great hierophants; on the other hand, its \"naturalmagicians\" who, through lack of the restraining power of proper spiritualenlightenment, and because of weakness of physical and mental organizations,unintentionally perverted their gifts to evil purposes. Moses had no word ofrebuke for those adepts in prophecy and other powers who had been instructed inthe colleges of esoteric wisdom * mentioned in the Bible. His denunciations werereserved for such as either wittingly or otherwise debased the powers inheritedfrom their Atlantian ancestors to the service of evil spirits, to the injury ofhumanity. His wrath was kindled against the spirit of Ob, not that of OD. *** The ruins which cover both Americas, and are found on many West Indian islands,are all attributed to the submerged Atlantians. As well as the hierophants ofthe old world, which in the days of Atlantis was almost connected with the newone by land, the magicians of the now submerged country had a net-work ofsubterranean passages running in all directions. In connection with thosemysterious catacombs we will now give a curious story told to us by a Peruvian,long since dead, as we were travelling together in the interior of his country.There must be truth in it; as it was afterward confirmed to us by an Italiangentleman who had seen the place and who, but for lack of means and time, wouldhave verified the tale himself, at least partially. The informant of the Italianwas an old priest, who had had the secret divulged to him, at confession, by aPeruvian Indian. We may add, moreover, that the priest was compelled to make therevelation, being at the time completely under the mesmeric influence of thetraveller. The story concerns the famous treasures of the last of the Incas. The Peruvianasserted that since the well-known and miserable murder of the latter byPizarro, the secret had been known to all the Indians, except the Mestizos whocould not be trusted. It runs thus: The Inca was made prisoner, and his wifeoffered for his liberation a room full of gold, \"from the floor up to theceiling, as high up as his conqueror could reach\" before the sun would set onthe third day. She kept her promise, but Pizarro broke his word, according toSpanish practice. Marvelling at the exhibition of such treasures, the conquerordeclared that he would not release the prisoner, but would murder him, unlessthe queen revealed the place whence the treasure came. He had heard that theIncas had somewhere an inexhaustible mine; a subterranean road or tunnel runningmany miles under ground, where were kept the accumulated riches of the country.The unfortunate queen begged for delay, and went to consult the oracles. Duringthe sacrifice, the chief-priest showed her in the consecrated \"black mirror\" *the unavoidable murder of her husband, whether she delivered the treasures ofthe crown to Pizarro or not. Then the queen gave the order to close theentrance, which was a door cut in the rocky wall of a chasm. Under the directionof the priest and magicians, the chasm was accordingly filled to the top withhuge masses of rock, and the surface covered over so as to conceal the work. TheInca was murdered by the Spaniards and his unhappy queen committed suicide.Spanish greed overreached itself and the secret of the buried treasures waslocked in the breasts of a few faithful Peruvians. Our Peruvian informant added that in consequence of certain indiscretions atvarious times, persons had been sent by different governments to search for thetreasure under the pretext of scientific exploration. They had rummaged thecountry through, but without realizing their object. So far this tradition iscorroborated by the reports of Dr. Tschuddi and other historians of Peru. Butthere are certain additional details which we are not aware have been madepublic before now. Several years after hearing the story, and its corroboration by the Italiangentleman, we again visited Peru. Going southward from Lima, by water, wereached a point near Arica at sunset, and were struck by the appearance of anenormous rock, nearly perpendicular, which stood in mournful solitude on theshore, apart from the range of the Andes. It was the tomb of the Incas. As thelast rays of the setting sun strike the face of the rock, one can make out, withan ordinary opera-glass, some curious hieroglyphics inscribed on the volcanicsurface. When Cusco was the capital of Peru, it contained a temple of the sun, famed farand near for its magnificence. It was roofed with thick plates of gold, and thewalls were covered with the same precious metal; the eave-troughs were also ofsolid gold. In the west wall the architects had contrived an aperture in such away that when the sunbeams reached it, it focused them inside the building.Stretching like a golden chain from one sparkling point to another, theyencircled the walls, illuminating the grim idols, and disclosing certain mysticsigns at other times invisible. It was only by understanding thesehieroglyphics--identical with those which may be seen to this day on the tomb ofthe Incas--that one could learn the secret of the tunnel and its approaches.Among the latter was one in the neighborhood of Cusco, now masked beyonddiscovery. This leads directly into an immense tunnel which runs from Cusco toLima, and then, turning southward, extends into Bolivia. At a certain point itis intersected by a royal tomb. Inside this sepulchral chamber are cunninglyarranged two doors; or, rather, two enormous slabs which turn upon pivots, andclose so tightly as to be only distinguishable from the other portions of thesculptured walls by the secret signs, whose key is in the possession of thefaithful custodians. One of these turning slabs covers the southern mouth of theLiman tunnel--the other, the northern one of the Bolivian corridor. The latter,running southward, passes through Trapaca and Cobijo, for Arica is not far awayfrom the little river called Pay'quina, * which is the boundary between Peru andBolivia. Not far from this spot stand three separate peaks which form a curious triangle;they are included in the chain of the Andes. According to tradition the onlypracticable entrance to the corridor leading northward is in one of these peaks;but without the secret of its landmarks, a regiment of Titans might rend therocks in vain in the attempt to find it. But even were some one to gain anentrance and find his way as far as the turning slab in the wall of thesepulchre, and attempt to blast it out, the superincumbent rocks are so disposedas to bury the tomb, its treasures, and--as the mysterious Peruvian expressed itto us--\"a thousand warriors\" in one common ruin. There is no other access to theArica chamber but through the door in the mountain near Pay'quina. Along theentire length of the corridor, from Bolivia to Lima and Cusco, are smallerhiding places filled with treasures of gold and precious stone, theaccumulations of many generations of Incas, the aggregate value of which isincalculable. We have in our possession an accurate plan of the tunnel, the sepulchre, and thedoors, given to us at the time by the old Peruvian. If we had ever thought ofprofiting by the secret, it would have required the cooperation of the Peruvianand Bolivian governments on an extensive scale. To say nothing of physicalobstacles, no one individual or small party could undertake such an explorationwithout encountering the army of smugglers and brigands with which the coast isinfested; and which, in fact, includes nearly the whole population. The meretask of purifying the mephitic air of the tunnel, which had not been entered forcenturies, would also be a serious one. There, however, the treasure lies, andthere the tradition says it will lie till the last vestige of Spanish ruledisappears from the whole of North and South America. The treasures exhumed by Dr. Schliemann at Mycenae, have awakened popularcupidity, and the eyes of adventurous speculators are being turned toward thelocalities where the wealth of ancient peoples is supposed to be buried, incrypt or cave, or beneath sand or alluvial deposit. Around no other locality,not even Peru, hang so many traditions as around the Gobi Desert. In IndependentTartary this howling waste of shifting sand was once, if report speakscorrectly, the seat of one of the richest empires the world ever saw. Beneaththe surface are said to lie such wealth in gold, jewels, statuary, arms,utensils, and all that indicates civilization, luxury, and fine arts, as noexisting capital of Christendom can show to-day. The Gobi sand moves regularlyfrom east to west before terrific gales that blow continually. Occasionally someof the hidden treasures are uncovered, but not a native dare touch them, for thewhole district is under the ban of a mighty spell. Death would be the penalty.Bahti--hideous, but faithful gnomes--guard the hidden treasures of thisprehistoric people, awaiting the day when the revolution of cyclic periods shallagain cause their story to be known for the instruction of mankind. According to local tradition, the tomb of Ghengiz Khan still exists near LakeTabasun Nor. Within lies the Mongolian Alexander, as though asleep. After threemore centuries he will awake and lead his people to new victories and anotherharvest of glory. Though this prophetic tradition be received with ever so manygrains of salt, we can affirm as a fact that the tomb itself is no fiction, norhas its amazing richness been exaggerated. The district of the Gobi wilderness and, in fact, the whole area of IndependentTartary and Thibet is jealously guarded against foreign intrusion. Those who arepermitted to traverse it are under the particular care and pilotage of certainagents of the chief authority, and are in duty bound to convey no intelligencerespecting places and persons to the outside world. But for this restriction,even we might contribute to these pages accounts of exploration, adventure, anddiscovery that would be read with interest. The time will come, sooner or later,when the dreadful sand of the desert will yield up its long-buried secrets, andthen there will indeed be unlooked-for mortifications for our modern vanity. \"The people of Pashai,\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_838]says Marco Polo, the daring traveller of the thirteenth century, \"are greatadepts in sorceries and the diabolic arts.\" And his learned editor adds: \"ThisPashai, or Udyana, was the native country of Padma Sambhava, one of the chiefapostles of lamaism, i.e., of Thibetan Buddhism, and a great master ofenchantments. The doctrines of Sakya, as they prevailed in Udyana in old times,were probably strongly tinged with Sivaitic magic, and the Thibetans stillregard the locality as the classic ground of sorcery and witchcraft.\" The \"old times\" are just like the \"modern times\"; nothing is changed as tomagical practices except that they have become still more esoteric and arcane,and that the caution of the adepts increases in proportion to the traveller'scuriosity. Hiouen-Thsang says of the inhabitants: \"The men . . . are fond ofstudy, but pursue it with no ardor. The science of magical formulae has become aregular professional business with them.\" **We will not contradict the venerableChinese pilgrim on this point, and are willing to admit that in the seventhcentury some people made \"a professional business\" of magic; so, also, do somepeople now, but certainly not the true adepts. It is not Hiouen-Thsang, thepious, courageous man, who risked his life a hundred times to have the bliss ofperceiving Buddha's shadow in the cave of Peshawer, who would have accused theholy lamas and monkish thaumaturgists of \"making a professional business\" ofshowing it to travellers. The injunction of Gautama, contained in his answer toKing Prasenagit, his protector, who called on him to perform miracles, must havebeen ever present to the mind of Hiouen-Thsang. \"Great king,\" said Gautama, \"Ido not teach the law to my pupils, telling them 'go, ye saints, and before theeyes of the Brahmans and householders perform, by means of your supernaturalpowers, miracles greater than any man can perform.' I tell them, when I teachthem the law, 'Live, ye saints, hiding your good works, and showing your sins.'\" Struck with the accounts of magical exhibitions witnessed and recorded bytravellers of every age who had visited Tartary and Thibet, Colonel Yule comesto the conclusion that the natives must have had \"at their command the wholeencyclopaedia of modern 'Spiritualists.' Duhalde mentions among their sorceriesthe art of producing by their invocations the figures of Laotsen *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_840] and their divinities inthe air, and of making a pencil write answers to questions without anybodytouching it.\" ** The former invocations pertain to religious mysteries of their sanctuaries; ifdone otherwise, or for the sake of gain, they are considered sorcery,necromancy, and strictly forbidden. The latter art, that of making a pencilwrite without contact, was known and practiced in China and other countriescenturies before the Christian era. It is the A B C of magic in those countries. When Hiouen-Thsang desired to adore the shadow of Buddha, it was not to\"professional magicians\" that he resorted, but to the power of his ownsoul-invocation; the power of prayer, faith, and contemplation. All was dark anddreary near the cavern in which the miracle was alleged to take place sometimes.Hiouen-Thsang entered and began his devotions. He made 100 salutations, butneither saw nor heard anything. Then, thinking himself too sinful, he criedbitterly, and despaired. But as he was going to give up all hope, he perceivedon the eastern wall a feeble light, but it disappeared. He renewed his prayers,full of hope this time, and again he saw the light, which flashed anddisappeared again. After this he made a solemn vow: he would not leave the cavetill he had the rapture to see at last the shadow of the \"Venerable of the Age.\"He had to wait longer after this, for only after 200 prayers was the dark cavesuddenly \"bathed in light, and the shadow of Buddha, of a brilliant white color,rose majestically on the wall, as when the clouds suddenly open, and, all atonce, display the marvellous image of the 'Mountain of Light.' A dazzlingsplendor lighted up the features of the divine countenance. Hiouen-Thsang waslost in contemplation and wonder, and would not turn his eyes away from thesublime and incomparable object.\" Hiouen-Thsang adds in his own diary,See-yu-kee, that it is only when man prays with sincere faith, and if he hasreceived from above a hidden impression, that he sees the shadow clearly, but hecannot enjoy the sight for any length of time. * Those who are so ready to accuse the Chinese of irreligion will do well to readSchott's Essays on Buddhism in China and Upper Asia. ** \"In the years Yuan-yeuof the Sung (A.D. 1086-1093) a pious matron with her two servants lived entirelyto the Land of Enlightenment. One of the maids said one day to her companion:'To-night I shall pass over to the Realm of Amita' (Buddha). The same night abalsamic odor filled the house, and the maid died without any preceding illness.On the following day the surviving maid said to her lady: 'Yesterday my deceasedcompanion appeared to me in a dream, and said: \"Thanks to the perseveringsupplications of our dear mistress, I am become an inhabitant of Paradise, andmy blessedness is past all expression in words.\" ' The matron replied: 'If shewill appear to me also, then will I believe all you say.' The next night thedeceased really appeared to her. The lady asked: 'May I, for once, visit theLand of Enlightenment?' 'Yea,' answered the blessed soul; 'thou hast but tofollow thine hand-maiden.' The lady followed her (in her dream), and soonperceived a lake of immeasurable expanse, overspread with innumerable red andwhite lotus flowers, of various sizes, some blooming, some fading. She askedwhat those flowers might signify? The maiden replied: 'These are all humanbeings on the Earth whose thoughts are turned to the Land of Enlightenment. Thevery first longing after the Paradise of Amita produces a flower in theCelestial Lake, and this becomes daily larger and more glorious as theself-improvement of the person whom it represents advances; in the contrarycase, it loses in glory and fades away.' *** The matron desired to know the nameof an enlightened one who reposed on one of the flowers, clad in a waving andwondrously glistening raiment. Her whilom maiden answered: 'That is Yang-kie.'Then asked she the name of another, and was answered: 'That is Mahu.' The lady then said: 'At what place shall I hereafter come into existence?' Thenthe Blessed Soul led her a space further, and showed her a hill that gleamedwith gold and azure. 'Here,' said she, 'is your future abode. You will belong tothe first order of the blessed.' When the matron awoke, she sent to inquire forYang-kie and Mahu. The first was already departed; the other still alive andwell. And thus the lady learned that the soul of one who advances in holinessand never turns back, may be already a dweller in the Land of Enlightenment,even though the body still sojourn in this transitory world.\" In the same essay, another Chinese story is translated, and to the same effect:\"I knew a man,\" says the author, \"who during his life had killed many livingbeings, and was at last struck with an apoplexy. The sorrows in store for hissin-laden soul pained me to the heart; I visited him, and exhorted him to callon the Amita; but he obstinately refused. His illness clouded his understanding;in consequence of his misdeeds he had become hardened. What was before such aman when once his eyes were closed? In this life the night followeth the day,and the winter followeth the summer; that, all men are aware of. But that lifeis followed by death, no man will consider. Oh, what blindness and obduracy isthis!\" (p. 93.) These two instances of Chinese literature hardly strengthen the usual charge ofirreligion and total materialism brought against the nation. The first littlemystical story is full of spiritual charm, and would grace any Christianreligious book. The second is as worthy of praise, and we have but to replace\"Amita\" with \"Jesus\" to have a highly Orthodox tale, as regards religioussentiments and code of philosophical morality. The following instance is stillmore striking, and we quote it for the benefit of Christian revivalists: \"Hoang-ta-tie, of T'anchen, who lived under the Sung, followed the craft of ablacksmith. Whenever he was at his work he used to call, without intermission,on the name of Amita Buddha. One day he handed to his neighbors the followingverses of his own composition to be spread about: -- 'Ding dong! The hammer-strokes fall long and fast,Until the iron turns to steel at last!Now shall the long, long day of rest begin,The Land of Bliss Eternal calls me in!'\"Thereupon he died. But his verses spread all over Honan, and many learned tocall upon Buddha.\" * To deny to the Chinese or any people of Asia, whether Central, Upper, or Lower,the possession of any knowledge, or even perception of spiritual things, isperfectly ridiculous. From one end to the other the country is full of mystics,religious philosophers, Buddhist saints, and magicians. Belief in a spiritualworld, full of invisible beings who, on certain occasions, appear to mortalsobjectively, is universal. \"According to the belief of the nations of CentralAsia,\" remarks I. J. Schmidt, \"the earth and its interior, as well as theencompassing atmosphere, are filled with spiritual beings, which exercise aninfluence, partly beneficent, partly malignant, on the whole of organic andinorganic nature. . . . Especially are deserts and other wild or uninhabitedtracts, or regions in which the influences of nature are displayed on a giganticand terrible scale, regarded as the chief abode or rendezvous of evil spirits.And hence the steppes of Turan, and in particular the great sandy Desert of Gobihave been looked on as the dwelling-place of malignant beings, from days ofhoary antiquity.\" Marco Polo--as a matter of course--mentions more than once in his curious bookof Travels, these tricky nature-spirits of the deserts. For centuries, andespecially in the last one, had his strange stories been completely rejected. Noone would believe him when he said he had witnessed, time and again, with hisown eyes, the most wonderful feats of magic performed by the subjects ofKublai-Khan and adepts of other countries. On his death-bed Marco was stronglyurged to retract his alleged \"falsehoods\"; but he solemnly swore to the truth ofwhat he said, adding that \"he had not told one-half of what he had really seen!\"There is now no doubt that he spoke the truth, since Marsden's edition, and thatof Colonel Yule have appeared. The public is especially beholden to the latterfor bringing forward so many authorities corroborative of Marco's testimony, andexplaining some of the phenomena in the usual way, for he makes it plain beyondquestion that the great traveller was not only a veracious but an exceedinglyobservant writer. Warmly defending his author, the conscientious editor, afterenumerating more than one hitherto controverted and even rejected point in theVenetian's Travels, concludes by saying: \"Nay, the last two years have thrown apromise of light even on what seemed the wildest of Marco's stories, and thebones of a veritable RUC from New Zealand lie on the table of Professor Owen'scabinet!\" * The monstrous bird of the Arabian Nights, or \"Arabian Mythology,\" as Webstercalls the Ruc (or Roc), having been identified, the next thing in order is todiscover and recognize that Aladdin's magical lamp has also certain claims toreality. Describing his passage through the great desert of Lop, Marco Polo speaks of amarvellous thing, \"which is that, when travellers are on the move by night . . .they will hear spirits talking. Sometimes the spirits will call him by name . .. even in the daytime one hears these spirits talking. And sometimes you shallhear the sound of a variety of musical instruments, and still more commonly thesound of drums.\" * In his notes, the translator quotes the Chinese historian, Matwanlin, whocorroborates the same. \"During the passage of this wilderness you hear sounds,\"says Matwanlin, \"sometimes of singing, sometimes of wailing; and it has oftenhappened that travellers going aside to see what those sounds might be, havestrayed from their course and been entirely lost; for they were voices ofspirits and goblins.\" ** \"These goblins are not peculiar to the Gobi,\" adds theeditor, \"though that appears to have been their most favored haunt. The awe ofthe vast and solitary desert raises them in all similar localities.\" Colonel Yule would have done well to consider the possibility of seriousconsequences arising from the acceptance of his theory. If we admit that theweird cries of the Gobi are due to the awe inspired \"by the vast and solitarydesert,\" why should the goblins of the Gadarenes (Luke viii. 29) be entitled toany better consideration? and why may not Jesus have been self-deceived as tohis objective tempter during the forty days' trial in the \"wilderness\"? We arequite ready to receive or reject the theory enunciated by Colonel Yule, butshall insist upon its impartial application to all cases. Pliny speaks of thephantoms that appear and vanish in the deserts of Africa; *** AEthicus, theearly Christian cosmographer, mentions, though incredulous, the stories thatwere told of the voices of singers and revellers in the desert; and \"Mas'uditells of the ghuls, which in the deserts appear to travellers by night and inlonely hours\"; and also of \"Apollonius of Tyana and his companions, who, in adesert near the Indus by moonlight, saw an empusa or ghul taking many forms. . .. They revile it, and it goes off uttering shrill cries.\" **** And Ibn Batutarelates a like legend of the Western Sahara: \"If the messenger be solitary, thedemons sport with him and fascinate him, so that he strays from his course andperishes.\" *****Now if all these matters are capable of a \"rationalexplanation,\" and we do not doubt it as regards most of these cases, then, theBible-devils of the wilderness deserve no more consideration, but should havethe same rule applied to them. They, too, are creatures of terror, imagination,and superstition; hence, the narratives of the Bible must be false; and if onesingle verse is false, then a cloud is thrown upon the title of all the rest tobe considered divine revelation. Once admit this, and this collection ofcanonical documents is at least as amenable to criticism as any other book ofstories. * There are many spots in the world where the strangest phenomena have resultedfrom what was later ascertained to be natural physical causes. In SouthernCalifornia there are certain places on the sea-shore where the sand whendisturbed produces a loud musical ring. It is known as the \"musical sand,\" andthe phenomenon is supposed to be of an electrical nature. \"The sound of musicalinstruments, chiefly of drums, is a phenomenon of another class, and is reallyproduced in certain situations among sandhills when the sand is disturbed,\" saysthe editor of Marco Polo. \"A very striking account of a phenomenon of this kind,regarded as supernatural, is given by Friar Odoric, whose experience I havetraced to the Reg Ruwan or flowing sand north of Kabul. Besides this celebratedexample . . . I have noted that equally well-known one of the Jibal Nakics, or'Hill of the Bell' in the Sinai desert; . . . Gibalul-Thabul, or hill of thedrums. . . . A Chinese narrative of the tenth century mentions the phenomenon asknown near Kwachau, on the eastern border of the Lop desert, under the name of\"the singing sands.\" ** That all these are natural phenomena, no one can doubt. But what of thequestions and answers, plainly and audibly given and received? What ofconversations held between certain travellers and the invisible spirits, orunknown beings, that sometimes appear to whole caravans in tangible form? If somany millions believe in the possibility that spirits may clothe themselves withmaterial bodies, behind the curtain of a \"medium,\" and appear to the circle, whyshould they reject the same possibility for the elemental spirits of thedeserts? This is the \"to be, or not to be\" of Hamlet. If \"spirits\" can do allthat Spiritualists claim for them, why can they not appear equally to thetraveller in the wildernesses and solitudes? A recent scientific article in aRussian journal attributes such \"spirit-voices,\" in the great Gobi desert, tothe echo. A very reasonable explanation, if it can only be demonstrated thatthese voices simply repeat what has been previously uttered by a living person.But when the \"superstitious\" traveller gets intelligent answers to hisquestions, this Gobi echo at once shows a very near relationship with the famousecho of the Theatre Porte St. Martin at Paris. \"How do you do, sir?\" shouts oneof the actors in the play. \"Very poorly, my son; thank you. I am getting old,very . . . very old!\" politely answers the echo! What incredulous merriment must the superstitious and absurd narratives of MarcoPolo, concerning the \"supernatural\" gifts of certain shark and wild-beastcharmers of India, whom he terms Abraiaman, have excited for long centuries.Describing the pearl-fishery of Ceylon, as it was in his time, he says that themerchants are \"obliged also to pay those men who charm the great fishes--toprevent them from injuring the divers whilst engaged in seeking pearls underwater--one-twentieth part of all that they take. These fish-charmers are termedAbraiaman (Brahman?), and their charm holds good for that day only, for at nightthey dissolve the charm, so that the fishes can work mischief at their will.These Abraiaman know also how to charm beasts and birds, and every livingthing.\" And this is what we find in the explanatory notes of Colonel Yule, in relationto this degrading Asiatic \"superstition\": \"Marco's account of the pearl-fisheryis still substantially correct. . . . At the diamond mines of the northernCircars, Brahmans are employed in the analogous office of propitiating thetutelary genii. The shark-charmers are called in Tamil, Kadal-Katti,'sea-binders,' and in Hindustani, Hai-banda, or 'shark-binders.' At Aripo theybelong to one family, supposed to have the monopoly of the charm. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_854] The chief operator is (orwas, not many years ago) paid by the government, and he also received tenoysters from each boat daily during the fishery. Tennent, on his visit, foundthe incumbent of the office to be a Roman Catholic Christian (?), but that didnot seem to affect the exercise of the validity of his functions. It isremarkable that not more than one authenticated accident from sharks had takenplace during the whole period of the British occupation.\" ** Two items of fact in the above paragraph are worthy of being placed injuxtaposition. 1. The British authorities pay professional shark-charmers astipend to exercise their art; and, 2, only one life has been lost since theexecution of the contract. (We have yet to learn whether the loss of this onelife did not occur under the Roman Catholic sorcerer.) Is it pretended that thesalary is paid as a concession to a degrading native superstition? Very well;but how about the sharks? Are they receiving salaries, also, from the Britishauthorities out of the Secret Service Fund? Every person who has visited Ceylonmust know that the waters of the pearl coast swarm with sharks of the mostvoracious kind, and that it is even dangerous to bathe, let alone to dive foroysters. We might go further, if we chose, and give the names of Britishofficials of the highest rank in the Indian service, who, after resorting tonative \"magicians\" and \"sorcerers,\" to assist them in recovering things lost, orin unravelling vexatious mysteries of one kind or another, and being successful,and at the time secretly expressing their gratitude, have gone away, and showntheir innate cowardice before the world's Areopagus, by publicly denying thetruth of magic, and leading the jest against Hindu \"superstition.\" Not many years ago, one of the worst of superstitions scientists held to be thatof believing that the murderer's portrait remained impressed on the eye of themurdered person, and that the former could be easily recognized by examiningcarefully the retina. The \"superstition\" asserted that the likeness could bemade still more striking by subjecting the murdered man to certain old women'sfumigations, and the like gossip. And now an American newspaper, of March 26,1877, says: \"A number of years ago attention was attracted to a theory whichinsisted that the last effort of vision materialized itself and remained as anobject imprinted on the retina of the eye after death. This has been proved afact by an experiment tried in the presence of Dr. Gamgee, F. R. S., ofBirmingham, England, and Prof. Bunsen, the subject being a living rabbit. Themeans taken to prove the merits of the question were most simple, the eyes beingplaced near an opening in a shutter, and retaining the shape of the same afterthe animal had been deprived of life.\" If, from the regions of idolatry, ignorance, and superstition, as India istermed by some missionaries, we turn to the so-called centre ofcivilization--Paris, we find the same principles of magic exemplified thereunder the name of occult Spiritualism. The Honorable John L. O'Sullivan,Ex-Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States to Portugal, has kindlyfurnished us with the strange particulars of a semi-magical seance which herecently attended with several other eminent men, at Paris. Having hispermission to that effect, we print his letter in full. \"NEW YORK, Feb. 7, 1877.\"I cheerfully obey your request for a written statement of what I related to youorally, as having been witnessed by me in Paris, last summer, at the house of ahighly respectable physician, whose name I have no authority to use, but whom,after the usual French fashion of anonymizing, I will call Dr. X.\"I was introduced there by an English friend, well-known in the Spiritualistcircles in London--Mr. Gledstanes. Some eight or ten other visitors werepresent, of both sexes. We were seated in fauteuils, occupying half of a longdrawing-room, flush with a spacious garden. In the other half of the room was agrand piano, a considerable open space between it and us, and a couple offauteuils in that space, evidently placed there to be occupied by other sitters.A door near them opened into the private apartments.\"Dr. X. came in, and discoursed to us for about twenty minutes with rapid andvehement French eloquence, which I could not undertake to report. He had, forover twenty-five years, investigated occult mysteries, of which he was about toexhibit some phenomena. His object was to attract his brethren of the scientificworld, but few or none of them came to see for themselves. He intended beforelong to publish a book. He presently led in two ladies, the younger one hiswife, the other (whom I will call Madame Y.) a medium or sensitive, with whom hehad worked through all that period in the prosecution of these studies, and whohad devoted and sacrificed her whole life to this work with him. Both theseladies had their eyes closed, apparently in trance.\"He stood them at the opposite ends of the long grand piano (which was shut),and directed them to put their hands upon it. Sounds soon began to issue fromits chords, marching, galloping, drums, trumpets, rolling musketry, cannon,cries, and groans--in one word, a battle. This lasted, I should say, some fiveto ten minutes.\"I should have mentioned that before the two mediums were brought in I hadwritten in pencil, on a small bit of paper (by direction of Mr. Gledstanes, whohad been there before), the names of three objects, to be known to myself alone,viz., some musical composer, deceased, a flower, and a cake. I chose Beethoven,a Marguerite (daisy), and a kind of French cake called plombieres, and rolledthe paper into a pellet, which I kept in my hand, without letting even my friendknow its contents.\"When the battle was over, he placed Mme. Y. in one of the two fauteuils, Mme.X. being seated apart at one side of the room, and I was asked to hand myfolded, or rolled, paper to Mme. Y. She held it (unopened) between her fingers,on her lap. She was dressed in white merino, flowing from her neck and gatheredin at the waist, under a blaze of light from chandeliers on the right and left.After a while she dropped the little roll of paper to the floor, and I picked itup. Dr. X. then raised her to her feet and told her to make \"the evocation ofthe dead.\" He withdrew the fauteuils and placed in her hand a steel rod of aboutfour and half or five feet in length, the top of which was surmounted with ashort cross-piece--the Egyptian Tau. With this she traced a circle roundherself, as she stood, of about six feet in diameter. She did not hold thecross-piece as a handle, but, on the contrary, she held the rod at the oppositeend. She presently handed it back to Dr. X. There she stood for some time, herhands hanging down and folded together in front of her, motionless, and with hereyes directed slightly upward toward one of the opposite corners of the longsalon. Her lips presently began to move, with muttered sounds, which after awhile became distinct in articulation, in short broken sentences or phrases,very much like the recitation of a litany. Certain words, seeming to be names,would recur from time to time. It sounded to me somewhat as I have heardOriental languages sound. Her face was very earnest and mobile with expression,with sometimes a slight frown on the brow. I suppose it lasted about fifteen ortwenty minutes, amidst the motionless silence of all the company, as we gazed onthe weird scene. Her utterance finally seemed to increase in vehemence andrapidity. At last she stretched forth one arm toward the space on which her eyeshad been fixed, and, with a loud cry, almost a scream, she exclaimed:'BEETHOVEN!'--and fell backward, prostrate on the floor.\"Dr. X. hastened to her, made eager magnetic passes about her face and neck, andpropped up her head and shoulders on cushions. And there she lay like a personsick and suffering, occasionally moaning, turning restlessly, etc. I suppose afull half-hour then elapsed, during which she seemed to pass through all thephases of gradual death (this I was told was a re-enacting of the death ofBeethoven). It would be long to describe in detail, even if I could recall all.We watched as though assisting at a scene of real death. I will only say thather pulse ceased; no beating of the heart could be perceived; her hands first,then her arms became cold, while warmth was still to be felt under her arm-pits;even they at last became entirely cold; her feet and legs became cold in thesame manner, and they swelled astonishingly. The doctor invited us all to comeand recognize these phenomena. The gasping breaths came at longer and longerintervals, and feebler and feebler. At last came the end; her head fellsidewise, her hands, which had been picking with the fingers about her dress,collapsed also. The doctor said, 'she is now dead'; and so it indeed seemed. Invehement haste he produced (I did not see from where) two small snakes, which heseemed to huddle about her neck and down into her bosom, making also eagertransverse passes about her head and neck. After a while she appeared to reviveslowly, and finally the doctor and a couple of men servants lifted her up andcarried her off into the private apartments, from which he soon returned. Hetold us that this was all very critical, but perfectly safe, but that no timewas to be lost, for otherwise the death, which he said was real, would bepermanent.\"I need not say how ghastly the effect of this whole scene had been on all thespectators. Nor need I remind you that this was no trickery of a performer paidto astonish. The scene passed in the elegant drawing-room of a respectablephysician, to which access without introduction is impossible, while (outside ofthe phenomenal facts) a thousand indescribable details of language, manner,expression, and action presented those minute guarantees of sincerity andearnestness which carry conviction to those who witness, though it may betransmitted to those who only hear or read of them.\"After a time Mme. Y. returned and was seated in one of the two fauteuils beforementioned, and I was invited to the other by her side. I had still in my handthe unopened pellet of paper containing the three words privately written by me,of which (Beethoven) had been the first. She sat for a few minutes with her openhands resting on her lap. They presently began to move restlessly about. \"Ah, itburns, it burns,\" she said, and her features contracted with an expression ofpain. In a few moments she raised one of them, and it contained a marguerite,the flower I had written as my second word. I received it from her, and after ithad been examined by the rest of the company, I preserved it. Dr. X. said it wasof a species not known in that part of the country; an opinion in which he wascertainly mistaken, as a few days afterwards I saw the same in the flower-marketof the Madeleine. Whether this flower was produced under her hands, or wassimply an apport, as in the phenomenon we are familiar with in the experiencesof Spiritualism, I do not know. It was the one or the other, for she certainlydid not have it as she sat there by my side, under a strong light, before itmade its appearance. The flower was perfectly fresh in every one of its delicatepetals.\"The third word I had written on my bit of paper was the name of acake--plombieres. She presently began to go through the motions of eating,though no cake was visible, and asked me if I would not go with her toPlombieres--the name of the cake I had written. This might have been simply acase of mind-reading.\"After this followed a scene in which Madame X., the doctor's wife, was said,and seemed to be, possessed by the spirit of Beethoven. The doctor addressed heras \"Monsieur Beethoven.\" She took no notice until he called the name aloud inher ear. She then responded with polite bows, etc. (You may remember thatBeethoven was extremely deaf.) After some conversation he begged her to play,and she seated herself at the piano and performed magnificently both some of hisknown music and some improvisations which were generally recognized by thecompany as in his style. I was told afterwards, by a lady friend of Madame X.,that in her normal state she was a very ordinary amateur performer. After abouthalf an hour spent in music and in dialogue in the character of Beethoven, towhom her face in expression, and her tumbled hair, seemed to acquire a strangeresemblance, the doctor placed in her hands a sheet of paper and a crayon, andasked her to sketch the face of the person she saw before her. She produced veryrapidly a profile sketch of a head and face resembling Beethoven's busts, thoughas a younger man; and she dashed off a rapid name under it, as though asignature, 'Beethoven.' I have preserved the sketch, though how the handwritingmay correspond with Beethoven's signature I cannot say.\"The hour was now late, and the company broke up; nor had I any time tointerrogate Dr. X. upon what we had thus witnessed. But I called on him with Mr.Gledstanes a few evenings afterwards. I found that he admitted the action ofspirits, and was a Spiritualist, but also a great deal more, having studied longand deeply into the occult mysteries of the Orient. So I understood him toconvey, while he seemed to prefer to refer me to his book, which he wouldprobably publish in the course of the present year. I observed a number of loosesheets on a table all covered with Oriental characters unknown to me--the workof Madame Y. in trance, as he said, in answer to an inquiry. He told us that inthe scene I had witnessed, she became (i.e., as I presumed, was possessed by) apriestess of one of the ancient Egyptian temples, and that the origin of it wasthis: A scientific friend of his had acquired in Egypt possession of the mummyof a priestess, and had given him some of the linen swathings with which thebody was enveloped, and from the contact with this cloth of 2,000 or 3,000 yearsold, the devotion of her whole existence to this occult relation, and twentyyears seclusion from the world, his medium, as sensitive Madame Y., had becomewhat I had seen. The language I had heard her speak was the sacred language ofthe temples in which she had been instructed, not so much by inspiration butvery much as we now study languages, by dictation, written exercises, etc.,being even chided and punished when she was dull or slow. He said that Jacolliothad heard her in a similar scene, and recognized sounds and words of the veryoldest sacred language as preserved in the temples of India, anterior, if Iremember right, to the epoch of the Sanscrit.\"Respecting the snakes he had employed in the hasty operation of restoring herto life, or rather perhaps arresting the last consummation of the process ofdeath, he said there was a strange mystery in their relation to the phenomena oflife and death. I understood that they were indispensable. Silence and inactionon our part were also insisted upon throughout, and any attempt at questioninghim at the time was peremptorily, almost angrily, suppressed. We might come andtalk afterward, or wait for the appearance of his book, but he alone seemedentitled to exercise the faculty of speech throughout all theseperformances--which he certainly did with great volubility, the while, with allthe eloquence and precision of diction of a Frenchman, combining scientificculture with vividness of imagination.\"I intended to return on some subsequent evening, but learned from Mr.Gledstanes that he had given them up for the present, disgusted with hisill-success in getting his professional colleagues and men of science to comeand witness what it was his object to show them.\"This is about as much as I can recall of this strange, weird evening, exceptingsome uninteresting details. I have given you the name and address of Dr. X.confidentially, because he would seem to have gone more or less far on the samepath as you pursue in the studies of your Theosophical Society. Beyond that Ifeel bound to keep it private, not having his authority to use it in any waywhich might lead to publicity.\"Very respectfully,\"Your friend and obedient servant,\"J. L. O'SULLIVAN.\"In this interesting case simple Spiritualism has transcended its routine andencroached upon the limits of magic. The features of mediumship are there, inthe double life led by the sensitive Madame Y., in which she passes an existencetotally distinct from the normal one, and by reason of the subordination of herindividuality to a foreign will, becomes the permutation of a priestess ofEgypt; and in the personation of the spirit of Beethoven, and in the unconsciousand cataleptic state into which she falls. On the other hand, the will-powerexercised by Dr. X. upon his sensitive, the tracing of the mystic circle, theevocations, the materialization of the desired flower, the seclusion andeducation of Madame Y., the employment of the wand and its form, the creationand use of the serpents, the evident control of the astral forces--all thesepertain to magic. Such experiments are of interest and value to science, butliable to abuse in the hands of a less conscientious practitioner than theeminent gentleman designated as Dr. X. A true Oriental kabalist would notrecommend their duplication. Spheres unknown below our feet; spheres still more unknown and still moreunexplored above us; between the two a handful of moles, blind to God's greatlight, and deaf to the whispers of the invisible world, boasting that they leadmankind. Where? Onward, they claim; but we have a right to doubt it. Thegreatest of our physiologists, when placed side by side with a Hindu fakir, whoknows neither how to read nor write, will very soon find himself feeling asfoolish as a school-boy who has neglected to learn his lesson. It is not byvivisecting living animals that a physiologist will assure himself of theexistence of man's soul, nor on the blade of the knife can he extract it from ahuman body. \"What sane man,\" inquires Sergeant Cox, the President of the LondonPsychological Society, \"what sane man who knows nothing of magnetism orphysiology, who had never witnessed an experiment nor learned its principles,would proclaim himself a fool by denying its facts and denouncing its theory?\"The truthful answer to this would be, \"two-thirds of our modern-day scientists.\"The impertinence, if truth can ever be impertinent, must be laid at the door ofhim who uttered it--a scientist of the number of those few who are brave andhonest enough to utter wholesome truths, however disagreeable. And there is nomistaking the real meaning of the imputation, for immediately after theirreverent inquiry, the learned lecturer remarks as pointedly: \"The chemisttakes his electricity from the electrician, the physiologist looks to thegeologist for his geology--each would deem it an impertinence in the other if hewere to pronounce judgment in the branch of knowledge not his own. Strange itis, but true as strange, that this rational rule is wholly set at naught in thetreatment of psychology. Physical scientists deem themselves competent topronounce a dogmatic judgment upon psychology and all that appertains to it,without having witnessed any of its phenomena, and in entire ignorance of itsprinciples and practice.\" * We sincerely hope that the two eminent biologists, Mr. Mendeleyeff, of St.Petersburg, and Mr. Ray Lankester, of London fame, will bear themselves underthe above as unflinchingly as their living victims do when palpitating undertheir dissecting knives. For a belief to have become universal, it must have been founded on an immenseaccumulation of facts, tending to strengthen it, from one generation to another.At the head of all such beliefs stands magic, or, if one would prefer--occultpsychology. Who, of those who appreciate its tremendous powers even from itsfeeble, half-paralyzed effects in our civilized countries, would dare disbelievein our days the assertions of Porphyry and Proclus, that even inanimate objects,such as statues of gods, could be made to move and exhibit a factitious life fora few moments? Who can deny the allegation? Is it those who testify daily overtheir own signatures that they have seen tables and chairs move and walk, andpencils write, without contact? Diogenes Laertius tells us of a certainphilosopher, Stilpo, who was exiled from Athens by the Areopagus, for havingdared to deny publicly that the Minerva of Pheidias was anything else than ablock of marble. But our own age, after having mimicked the ancients ineverything possible, even to their very names, such as \"senates,\" \"prefects,\"and \"consuls,\" etc.; and after admitting that Napoleon the Great conqueredthree-fourths of Europe by applying the principles of war taught by the Caesarsand the Alexanders, knows so much better than its preceptors about psychology,that it would vote every believer in \"animated tables\" into Bedlam. Be this as it may, the religion of the ancients is the religion of the future. Afew centuries more, and there will linger no sectarian beliefs in either of thegreat religions of humanity. Brahmanism and Buddhism, Christianity andMahometanism will all disappear before the mighty rush of facts. \"I will pourout my spirit upon all flesh,\" writes the prophet Joel. \"Verily I say unto you .. . greater works than these shall you do,\" promises Jesus. But this can onlycome to pass when the world returns to the grand religion of the past; theknowledge of those majestic systems which preceded, by far, Brahmanism, and eventhe primitive monotheism of the ancient Chaldeans. Meanwhile, we must rememberthe direct effects of the revealed mystery. The only means by which the wisepriests of old could impress upon the grosser senses of the multitudes the ideaof the Omnipotency of the Creative will or FIRST CAUSE; namely, the divineanimation of inert matter, the soul infused into it by the potential will ofman, the microcosmic image of the great Architect, and the transportation ofponderous objects through space and material obstacles. Why should the pious Roman Catholic turn away in disgust at the \"heathen\"practices of the Hindu Tamil, for instance? We have witnessed the miracle of SanGennaro, in good old Naples, and we have seen the same in Nargercoil, in India.Where is the difference? The coagulated blood of the Catholic saint is made toboil and fume in its crystal bottle, to the gratification of the lazzaroni; andfrom its jewelled shrine the martyr's idol beams radiant smiles and blessings atthe Christian congregation. On the other hand, a ball of clay filled with water,is stuffed into the open breast of the god Suran; and while the padre shakes hisbottle and produces his \"miracle\" of blood, the Hindu priest plunges an arrowinto the god's breast, and produces his \"miracle,\" for the blood gushes forth instreams, and the water is changed into blood. Both Christians and Hindus fall inraptures at the sight of such a miracle. So far, we do not see the slightestdifference. But can it be that the Pagan learned the trick from San Gennaro? \"Know, O, Asclepius,\" says Hermes, \"that as the HIGHEST ONE is the father of thecelestial gods, so is man the artisan of the gods who reside in the temples, andwho delight in the society of mortals. Faithful to its origin and nature,humanity perseveres in this imitation of the divine powers; and, if the FatherCreator has made in His image the eternal gods, mankind in its turn makes itsgods in its own image.\" \"And, dost thou speak of statues of gods; O,Trismegistus?\" \"Verily, I do, Asclepius, and however great thy defiance,perceivest thou not that these statues are endowed with reason, that they areanimated with a soul, and that they can operate the greatest prodigies. How canwe reject the evidence, when we find these gods possessing the gift ofpredicting the future, which they are compelled to tell, when forced to it bymagic spells, as through the lips of the divines and their visions? . . . It isthe marvel of marvels that man could have invented and created gods. . . . True,the faith of our ancestors has erred, and in their pride they fell into error asto the precise essence of these gods . . . but they have still found out thatart themselves. Powerless to create soul and spirit, they evoke the souls ofangels and demons in order to introduce them into the consecrated statues; andso make them preside at their Mysteries, by communicating to idols their ownfaculty to do good as well as evil.\" It is not antiquity alone which is full of evidence that the statues and idolsof the gods at times exhibited intelligence and locomotive powers. Full in thenineteenth century, we see the papers recording the capers played by the statueof the Madonna of Lourdes. This gracious lady, the French Notre Dame, runs awayseveral times to the woods adjoining her usual residence, the parish church. Thesexton is obliged to hunt after the runaway, and bring her home more thanonce. * After this begins a series of \"miracles,\" healing, prophesying,letter-dropping from on high, and what not. These \"miracles\" are implicitlyaccepted by millions and millions of Roman Catholics; numbers of these belongingto the most intelligent and educated classes. Why, then, should we disbelieve intestimony of precisely the same character, given as to contemporary phenomena ofthe same kind, by the most accredited and esteemed historians--by Titus Livy,for instance? \"Juno, would you please abandon the walls of Veii, and change thisabode for that of Rome?\" inquires of the goddess a Roman soldier, after theconquest of that city. Juno consents, and nodding her head in token ofacquiescence, her statue answers: \"Yes, I will.\" Furthermore, upon theircarrying off the figure, it seems to instantly \"lose its immense weight,\" addsthe historian, and the statue seems rather to follow them than otherwise. ** With naivete, and a faith bordering on the sublime, des Mousseaux, bravelyrushes into the dangerous parallels, and gives a number of instances ofChristian as well as \"heathen\" miracles of that kind. He prints a list of suchwalking statues of saints and Madonnas, who lose their weight, and move about asso many living men and women; and presents unimpeachable evidence of the same,from classical authors, who described their miracles. *** He has but onethought, one anxious and all-overpowering desire--to prove to his readers thatmagic does exist,and that Christianity beats it flat. Not that the miracles ofthe latter are either more numerous, or more extraordinary, or suggestive thanthose of the Pagans. Not at all; and he is a fair historian as to facts andevidence. But, it is his arguments and reflections that are priceless: one kindof miracle is produced by God, the other by the Devil; he drags down the Deityand placing Him face to face with Satan, allows the arch-enemy to beat theCreator by long odds. Not a word of solid, evident proof to show the substantialdifference between the two kinds of wonders. Would we inquire the reason why he traces in one the hand of God and in theother the horn and hoof of the Devil? Listen to the answer: \"The Holy RomanCatholic and Apostolical Church declares the miracles wrought by her faithfulsons produced by the will of God; and all others the work of the spirits ofHell.\" Very well, but on what ground? We are shown an endless list of holywriters; of saints who fought during their whole lives with the fiends; and offathers whose word and authority are accepted as \"word of God\" by the sameChurch. \"Your idols, your consecrated statues are the abode of demons,\" exclaimsSt. Cyprian. \"Yes, it is these spirits who inspire your divines, who animate thebowels of your victims, who govern the flight of birds, and who, mixingincessantly falsehood with truth, render oracles, and . . . operate prodigies,their object being to bring you invincibly to their worship.\" * Fanaticism in religion, fanaticism in science, or fanaticism in any otherquestion becomes a hobby, and cannot but blind our senses. It will ever beuseless to argue with a fanatic. And here we cannot help admiring once more theprofound knowledge of human nature which dictated to Mr. Sergeant Cox thefollowing words, delivered in the same address as before alluded to: \"There isno more fatal fallacy than that the truth will prevail by its own force, that ithas only to be seen to be embraced. In fact the desire for the actual truthexists in very few minds, and the capacity to discern it in fewer still. Whenmen say that they are seeking the truth, they mean that they are looking forevidence to support some prejudice or prepossession. Their beliefs are mouldedto their wishes. They see all, and more than all, that seems to tell for thatwhich they desire; they are blind as bats to whatever tells against them. Thescientists are no more exempt from this common failing than are others.\" We know that from the remotest ages there has existed a mysterious, awfulscience, under the name of theopoea. This science taught the art of endowing thevarious symbols of gods with temporary life and intelligence. Statues and blocks of inert matter became animated under the potential will ofthe hierophant. The fire stolen by Prometheus had fallen down in the struggle toearth; it embraced the lower regions of the sky, and settled in the waves of theuniversal ether as the potential Akasa of the Hindu rites. We breathe and imbibeit into our organic system with every mouthful of fresh air. Our organism isfull of it from the instant of our birth. But it becomes potential only underthe influx of WILL and SPIRIT. Left to itself, this life-principle will blindly follow the laws of nature; and,according to conditions, will produce health and an exuberance of life, or causedeath and dissolution. But, guided by the will of the adept, it becomesobedient; its currents restore the equilibrium in organic bodies, they fill thewaste, and produce physical and psychological miracles, well-known tomesmerizers. Infused in inorganic and inert matter, they create an appearance oflife, hence motion. If to that life an individual intelligence, a personality,is wanting, then the operator must either send his scin-lecca, his own astralspirit, to animate it; or use his power over the region of nature-spirits toforce one of them to infuse his entity into the marble, wood, or metal; or,again, be helped by human spirits. But the latter--except the vicious,earth-bound class * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu014.htm#fn_861]--willnot infuse their essence into these inanimate objects. They leave the lowerkinds to produce the similitude of life and animation, and only send theirinfluence through the intervening spheres like a ray of divine light, when theso-called \"miracle\" is required for a good purpose. The condition--and this is alaw in spiritual nature--is purity of motive, purity of the surrounding magneticatmosphere, personal purity of the operator. Thus is it, that a Pagan \"miracle\"may be by far holier than a Christian one. Who that has seen the performance of the fakirs of Southern India, can doubt theexistence of theopoea in ancient times? An inveterate skeptic, though more thananxious to attribute every phenomenon to jugglery, still finds himself compelledto testify to facts; and facts that are to be witnessed daily if one chooses. \"Idare not,\" he says, speaking of Chibh-Chondor, a fakir of Jaffna-patnam,\"describe all the exercises which he performed. There are things one dares notsay even charged with having been under an inexplicable hallucination! And yet,ten, nay, twenty times, I saw and saw again the fakir obtain similar resultsover inert matter. . . . It was but child's play for our 'charmer' to make theflame of candles which had, by his directions, been placed in the remotestcorners of the apartment, pale and become extinguished at will; to cause thefurniture to move, even the sofas on which we sat, the doors to open and shutrepeatedly: and all this without quitting the mat upon which he sat on thefloor. \"Perhaps I will be told that I saw imperfectly. Possibly; but I will say thathundreds and thousands of persons have seen and do see what I have, and thingsmore wonderful; has one of all these discovered the secret, or been able toduplicate these phenomena? And I can never repeat too often that all this doesnot occur on a stage, supplied with mechanical contrivances for the use of theoperator. No, it is a beggar crouched, naked, on the floor, who thus sports withyour intelligence, your senses, and all that which we have agreed amongourselves to style the immutable laws of nature, but which he appears to alterat will! \"Does he change its course? 'No, but he makes it act by using forces which areyet unknown to us,' say the believers. However that may be, I have found myselftwenty times at similar performances in company with the most distinguished menof British India--professors, physicians, officers. Not one of them but thussummarized his impressions upon quitting the drawing-room. 'This is somethingterrifying to human intelligence!' Every time that I saw repeated by a fakir theexperiment of reducing serpents to a cataleptic state, a condition in whichthese animals have all the rigidity of the dry branch of a tree, my thoughtshave reverted to the biblical fable (?) which endows Moses and the priests ofPharaoh with the like power.\" * Assuredly, the flesh of man, beast, and bird should be as easily endowed withmagnetic life-principle as the inert table of a modern medium. Either bothwonders are possible and true, or both must fall to the ground, together withthe miracles of Apostolic days, and those of the more modern Popish Church. Asfor vital proofs furnished to us in favor of such possibilities, we might namebooks enough to fill a whole library. If Sixtus V. cited a formidable array ofspirits attached to various talismans, was not his threat of excommunication forall those who practiced the art, uttered merely because he would have theknowledge of this secret confined within the precincts of the Church? How wouldit do for his \"divine\" miracles to be studied and successfully reproduced byevery man endowed with perseverance, a strong positive magnetic power, and anunflinching will? Recent events at Lourdes (of course, supposing them to havebeen truthfully reported) prove that the secret is not wholly lost; and if thereis no strong magician-mesmerizer concealed under frock and surplice, then thestatue of Notre-Dame is moved by the same forces which move every magnetizedtable at a spiritual seance; and the nature of these \"intelligences,\" whetherthey belong to the classes of human, human elementary, or elemental spiritsdepends on a variety of conditions. With one who knows anything of mesmerism,and at the same time of the charitable spirit of the Roman Catholic Church, itought not to be difficult to comprehend that the incessant curses of the priestsand monks; and the bitter anathemas so freely pronounced by Pius IX.--himself astrong mesmerizer, and believed to be a jettatore (evil eye)--have drawntogether legions of elementaries and elementals under the leadership of thedisembodied Torquemadas. These are the \"angels\" who play pranks with the statueof the Queen of Heaven. Any one who accepts the \"miracle\" and thinks otherwiseblasphemes. Although it would seem as if we had already furnished sufficient proofs thatmodern science has little or no reason to boast of originality, yet beforeclosing this volume we will adduce a few more to place the matter beyond doubt.We have but to recapitulate, as briefly as possible, the several claims to newphilosophies and discoveries, the announcement of which has made the world openits eyes so wide within these last two centuries. We have pointed to theachievements in arts, sciences, and philosophy of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks,Chaldeans, and Assyrians; we will now quote from an author who has passed longyears in India studying their philosophy. In the famous and recent work ofChristna et le Christ, we find the following tabulation: \"Philosophy.--The ancient Hindus have created from the foundation the twosystems of spiritualism and materialism, of metaphysical philosophy and ofpositive philosophy. The first taught in the Vedantic school, whose founder wasVyasa; the second taught in the Sankya school, whose founder was Kapila. \"Astronomical Science.--They fixed the calendar, invented the zodiac, calculatedthe precession of the equinoxes, discovered the general laws of the movements,observed and predicted the eclipses. \"Mathematics.--They invented the decimal system, algebra, the differential,integral, and infinitesimal calculi. They also discovered geometry andtrigonometry, and in these two sciences they constructed and proved theoremswhich were only discovered in Europe as late as the seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies. It was the Brahmans in fact who first deduced the superficial measureof a triangle from the calculation of its three sides, and calculated therelations of the circumference to the diameter. Furthermore, we must restore tothem the square of the hypotenuse and the table so improperly calledPythagorean, which we find engraved on the goparama of the majority of greatpagodas. \"Physics.--They established the principle which is still our own to-day, thatthe universe is a harmonious whole, subject to laws which may be determined byobservation and experiment. They discovered hydrostatics; and the famousproposition that every body plunged in water loses of its own weight a weightequal to the volume which it displaces, is only a loan made by the Brahmans tothe famous Greek architect, Archimedes. The physicists of the pagodas calculatedthe velocity of light, fixed in a positive manner the laws which it follows inits reflection. And finally, it is beyond doubt, from the calculations ofSurya-Sidhenta, that they knew and calculated the force of steam. \"Chemistry.--They knew the composition of water, and formulated for gases thefamous law, which we know only from yesterday, that the volumes of gas are ininverse ratio to the pressures that they support. They knew how to preparesulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids; the oxides of copper, iron, lead, tin,and zinc; the sulphurets of iron, copper, mercury, antimony, and arsenic; thesulphates of zinc and iron; the carbonates of iron, lead, and soda; nitrate ofsilver; and powder. \"Medicine.--Their knowledge was truly astonishing. In Tcharaka and Sousruta, thetwo princes of Hindu medicine, is laid down the system which Hippocratesappropriated later. Sousruta notably enunciates the principles of preventivemedicine or hygiene, which he places much above curative medicine--too often,according to him, empyrical. Are we more advanced to-day? It is not withoutinterest to remark that the Arab physicians, who enjoyed a merited celebrity inthe middle ages--Averroes among others--constantly spoke of the Hinduphysicians, and regarded them as the initiators of the Greeks and themselves. \"Pharmacology.--They knew all the simples, their properties, their use, and uponthis point have not yet ceased to give lessons to Europe. Quite recently we havereceived from them the treatment of asthma, with the datura. \"Surgery.--In this they are not less remarkable. They made the operation for thestone, succeeded admirably in the operation for cataract, and the extraction ofthe foetus, of which all the unusual or dangerous cases are described byTcharaka with an extraordinary scientific accuracy. \"Grammar.--They formed the most marvellous language in the world--theSanscrit--which gave birth to the greater part of the idioms of the Orient, andof Indo-European countries. \"Poetry.--They have treated all the styles, and shown themselves supreme mastersin all. Sakuntala, Avrita, the Hindu Phaedra, Saranga, and a thousand otherdramas have their superiors neither in Sophocles nor Euripides, in Corneille norShakespere. Their descriptive poetry has never been equalled. One must read, inthe Megadata, \"The Plaint of an Exile,\" who implores a passing cloud to carryhis remembrances to his cottage, his relatives and friends, whom he will neversee more, to form an idea of the splendor to which this style has been carriedin India. Their fables have been copied by all modern and ancient peoples, whohave not even given themselves the trouble to color differently the subject ofthese little dramas. \"Music.--They invented the gamut with its differences of tones and half-tonesmuch before Gui d'Arezzo. Here is the Hindu scale: Sa--Ri--Ga--Ma--Pa--Da--Ni--Sa.\"Architecture.--They seem to have exhausted all that the genius of man iscapable of conceiving. Domes, inexpressibly bold; tapering cupolas; minarets,with marble lace; Gothic towers; Greek hemicycles; polychrome style--all kindsand all epochs are there, betokening the origin and date of the differentcolonies, which, in emigrating, carried with them their souvenirs of theirnative art.\" Such were the results attained by this ancient and imposing Brahmanicalcivilization. What have we to offer for comparison? Beside such majesticachievements of the past, what can we place that will seem so grandiose andsublime as to warrant our boast of superiority over an ignorant ancestry? Besidethe discoverers of geometry and algebra, the constructors of human speech, theparents of philosophy, the primal expounders of religion, the adepts inpsychological and physical science, how even the greatest of our biologists andtheologians seem dwarfed! Name to us any modern discovery, and we venture tosay, that Indian history need not long be searched before the prototype will befound of record. Here we are with the transit of science half accomplished, andall our ideas in process of readjustment to the theories of force-correlation,natural selection, atomic polarity, and evolution. And here, to mock ourconceit, our apprehensions, and our despair, we may read what Manu said, perhaps10,000 years before the birth of Christ: \"The first germ of life was developed by water and heat\" (Manu, book i., sloka8). \"Water ascends toward the sky in vapors; from the sun it descends in rain, fromthe rain are born the plants, and from the plants, animals\" (book iii., sloka76). \"Each being acquires the qualities of the one which immediately precedes it, insuch a manner that the farther a being gets away from the primal atom of itsseries, the more he is possessed of qualities and perfections\" (book i., sloka20). \"Man will traverse the universe, gradually ascending, and passing through therocks, the plants, the worms, insects, fish, serpents, tortoises, wild animals,cattle, and higher animals. . . . Such is the inferior degree\" (Ibid.). \"These are the transformations declared, from the plant up to Brahma, which haveto take place in his world\" (Ibid.). \"The Greek,\" says Jacolliot, \"is but the Sanscrit. Pheidias and Praxiteles havestudied in Asia the chefs-d'oeuvre of Daonthia, Ramana, and Aryavosta. Platodisappears before Dgeminy and Veda-Vyasa, whom he literally copies. Aristotle isthrown into the shade by the Pourva-Mimansa and the Outtara-Mimansa, in whichone finds all the systems of philosophy which we are now occupied in re-editing,from the Spiritualism of Socrates and his school, the skepticism of Pyrrho,Montaigne, and Kant, down to the positivism of Littre.\" Let those who doubt the exactness of the latter assertion read this phrase,extracted textually from the Outtara-Mimansa, or Vedanta, of Vyasa, who lived atan epoch which the Brahmanical chronology fixes at 10,400 years before our era: \"We can only study phenomena, verify them, and hold them to be relatively true,but nothing in the universe, neither by perception nor by induction, nor by thesenses, nor by reasoning, being able to demonstrate the existence of a SupremeCause, which could, at a fixed point of time, have given birth to the universe,Science has to discuss neither the possibility nor impossibility of this SupremeCause.\" Thus, gradually but surely, will the whole of antiquity be vindicated. Truthwill be carefully sifted from exaggeration; much that is now considered fictionmay yet be proved fact, and the \"facts and laws\" of modern science found tobelong to the limbo of exploded myths. When, centuries before our era, the HinduBramaheupto affirmed that the starry sphere was immovable, and that the dailyrising and setting of stars confirms the motion of the earth upon its axis; andwhen Aristarchus of Samos, born 267 years B.C., and the Pythagorean philosopherNicete, the Syracusan, maintained the same, what was the credit given to theirtheories until the days of Copernicus and Galileo? And the system of these twoprinces of science--a system which has revolutionized the whole world--how longwill it be allowed to remain as a complete and undisturbed whole? Have we not,at the present moment, in Germany, a learned savant, a Professor Schoepfer, who,in his public lectures at Berlin, tries to demonstrate, 1, that the earth isimmovable; 2, the sun is but a little bigger than it seems; and 3, thatTycho-Brahe was perfectly right and Galileo perfectly wrong? * And what wasTycho-Brahe's theory? Why, that the earth stands immovable in the centre of theuniverse, and that around it, as around its centre, the whole of the celestialvault gravitates every twenty-four hours; and finally, that the sun and moon,apart from this motion, proceed on curved lines peculiar to themselves, whileMercury, with the rest of the planets, describes an epicycloid. We certainly have no intention to lose time nor devote space to either combatingor supporting this new theory, which suspiciously resembles the old ones ofAristotle and even the Venerable Bede. We will leave the learned army of modernAcademicians to \"wash their family linen among themselves,\" to use an expressionof the great Napoleon. But we will, nevertheless, avail ourselves of such a goodopportunity as this defection affords to demand once more of science her diplomaor patents of infallibility. Alas! are these, then, the results of her boastedprogress? It was hardly more than yesterday when, upon the strength of facts within ourown observation, and corroborated by the testimony of a multitude of witnesses,we timidly ventured the assertion that tables, mediums, and Hindu fakirs wereoccasionally levitated. And when we added that, if such a phenomenon shouldhappen but once in a century, \"without a visible mechanical cause, then thatrising is a manifestation of a natural law of which our scientists are yetignorant,\" we were called \"iconoclastic,\" and charged, in our turn, by thenewspapers, with ignorance of the law of gravitation. Iconoclastic or not, wenever thought of charging science with denying the rotation of the earth on itsaxis, or its revolution around the sun. Those two lamps, at least, in the beaconof the Academy, we thought would be kept trimmed and burning to the end of time.But, lo! here comes a Berlin professor and crushes our last hopes that Scienceshould prove herself exact in some one particular. The cycle is truly at itslowest point, and a new era is begun. The earth stands still, and Joshua isvindicated! In days of old--in 1876--the world believed in centrifugal force, and theNewtonian theory, which explained the flattening of the poles by the rotatorymotion of the earth around its axis, was orthodox. Upon this hypothesis, thegreater portion of the globular mass was believed to gravitate toward theequator; and in its turn the centrifugal force, acting on the mass with itsmightiest power, forced this mass to concentrate itself on the equator. Thus isit that the credulous scientists believed the earth to rotate around its axis;for, were it otherwise, there would exist no centrifugal force, and without thisforce there could be no gravitation toward the equatorial latitudes. It has beenone of the accepted proofs of the rotation of the earth, and it is thisdeduction, with several others, that the Berlin professor declares that, \"incommon with many other scientists,\" he \"rejects.\" \"Is this not ridiculous, gentlemen,\" he concludes, \"that we, confiding in whatwe were taught at school, have accepted the rotation of the earth around itsaxis as a fact fully demonstrated, while there is nothing at all to prove it,and it cannot be demonstrated? Is it not cause of astonishment that thescientists of the whole educated world, commencing with Copernicus and Kepler,should have begun by accepting such a movement of our planet, and then three anda half centuries later be searching for such proofs? But, alas! though wesearch, we find none, as was to be expected. All, all is vain!\" And thus it is that at one stroke the world loses its rotation, and the universeis bereaved of its guardians and protectors, the centrifugal and centripetalforces! Nay, ether itself, blown out of space, is but a \"fallacy,\" a myth bornof a bad habit of using empty words; the sun is a pretender to dimensions towhich it was never entitled; the stars are twinkling dots, and \"were soexpressly disposed at considerable distances from one another by the Creator ofthe universe, probably with the intention that they should simultaneouslyillumine the vast spaces on the face of our globe\"--says Dr. Schoepfer. And is it so that even three centuries and a half have not sufficed the men ofexact science to construct one theory that not a single university professorwould dare challenge? If astronomy, the one science built on the adamantinefoundation of mathematics, the one of all others deemed as infallible andunassailable as truth itself, can be thus irreverently indicted for falsepretences, what have we gained by cheapening Plato to the profit of theBabinets? How, then, do they venture to flout at the humblest observer who,being both honest and intelligent, may say he has seen a mediumistic, or magicalphenomenon? And how dare they prescribe the \"limits of philosophical inquiry,\"to pass beyond which is not lawful? And these quarrelling hypothesists stillarraign as ignorant and superstitious those giant intellects of the past, whohandled natural forces like world-building Titans, and raised mortality to aneminence where it allied itself with the gods! Strange fate of a centuryboasting to have elevated exact science to its apex of fame, and now invited togo back and begin it's A B C of learning again! Recapitulating the evidence contained in this work, if we begin with the archaicand unknown ages of the Hermetic Pimander, and come down to 1876, we find thatone universal belief in magic has run through all these centuries. We havepresented the ideas of Trismegistus in his dialogue with Asclepius; and withoutmentioning the thousand and one proofs of the prevalence of this belief in thefirst centuries of Christianity, to achieve our purpose we have but to quotefrom an ancient and a modern author. The first will be the great philosopherPorphyry, who several thousand years after the days of Hermes, remarks inrelation to the prevailing skepticism of his century, the following: \"We neednot be amazed in seeing the vulgar masses (ὁι πολλοι) perceive in statues merelystone and wood. Thus it is generally with those who, ignorant in letters, findnaught in stylae covered with inscriptions but stone, and in written booksnaught but the tissue of the papyrus.\" And 1,500 years later, we see Mr.Sergeant Cox, in stating the case of the shameful prosecution of a medium byjust such a blind materialist, thus expressing his ideas: \"Whether the medium isguilty or guiltless . . . certain it is that the trial has had the unlooked-foreffect of directing the attention of the whole public to the fact that thephenomena are asserted to exist, and by a great number of competentinvestigators are declared to be true, and of the reality of which every personmay, if he pleases, satisfy himself by actual inspection, thus sweeping away,thus and for ever, the dark and debasing doctrines of the materialists.\" Still, in harmony with Porphyry and other theurgists, who affirmed the differentnatures of the manifesting \"spirits\" and the personal spirit or will of man, Mr.Sergeant Cox adds, without committing himself any further to a personaldecision: \"True, there are differences of opinions . . . and perhaps ever willbe, as to the sources of the power that is exhibited in these phenomena; butwhether they are the product of the psychic force of the circle . . . or, ifspirits of the dead be the agents, as others say, or elemental spirits (whateverit may be) as asserted by a third party, this fact at least is established--thatman is not wholly material, that the mechanism of man is moved and directed bysome non-material--that is, some non-molecular structure, which possesses notmerely intelligence, but can exercise also a force upon matter, that somethingto which, for lack of a better title, we have given the name of soul. These gladtidings have by this trial been borne to thousands and tens of thousands, whosehappiness here, and hopes of a hereafter, have been blighted by thematerialists, who have preached so persistently that soul was but asuperstition, man but an automaton, mind but a secretion, present existencepurely animal, and the future--a blank.\" \"Truth alone,\" says Pimander, \"is eternal and immutable; truth is the first ofblessings; but truth is not and cannot be on earth: it is possible that Godsometimes gifts a few men together with the faculty of comprehending divinethings with that of rightly understanding truth; but nothing is true on earth,for everything has matter on it, clothed with a corporeal form subject tochange, to alteration, to corruption, and to new combinations. Man is not thetruth, for only that which has drawn its essence from itself, and remainsitself, and unchangeable, is true. How can that which changes so as not tofinally be recognized, be ever true? Truth, then, is that only which isimmaterial and not enclosed within a corporeal envelope, that which is colorlessand formless, exempt from change and alteration; that which is ETERNAL. All ofthat which perishes is a lie; earth is but dissolution and generation; everygeneration proceeds from a dissolution; the things of earth are but appearancesand imitations of truth; they are what the picture is to reality. The things ofearth are not the TRUTH! . . . Death, for some persons, is an evil which strikesthem with profound terror. This is ignorance. . . . Death is the destruction ofthe body; the being in it dies not. . . . The material body loses its form,which is disintegrated in course of time; the senses which animated it return totheir source and resume their functions; but they gradually lose their passionsand their desires, and the spirit ascends to heaven to become a HARMONY. In thefirst zone, it leaves behind itself the faculty of increasing and decreasing; inthe second, the power of doing evil and the frauds of idleness; in the third,deceptions and concupiscence; in the fourth, insatiable ambition; in the fifth,arrogance, audacity, and temerity; in the sixth, all yearning after dishonestacquisitions; and in the seventh, untruthfulness. The spirit thus purified bythe effect on him of the celestial harmonies, returns once more to its primitivestate, strong of a merit and power self-acquired, and which belongs to itproperly; and only then he begins to dwell with those that sing eternally theirpraises of the FATHER. Hitherto, he is placed among the powers, and as such hasattained to the supreme blessing of knowledge. He is become a GOD! . . . No, thethings of earth are not the truth.\" After having devoted their whole lives to the study of the records of the oldEgyptian wisdom, both Champollion-Figeac and Champollion, Junior, publiclydeclared, notwithstanding many biassed judgments hazarded by certain hasty andunwise critics, that the Books of Hermes \"truly contain a mass of Egyptiantraditions which are constantly corroborated by the most authentic records andmonuments of Egypt of the hoariest antiquity.\" * Closing up his voluminous summary of the psychological doctrines of theEgyptians, the sublime teachings of the sacred Hermetic books, and theattainments of the initiated priests in metaphysical and practical philosophy,Champollion-Figeac inquires--as he well may, in view of the then attainableevidence--\"whether there ever was in the world another association or caste ofmen which could equal them in credit, power, learning, and capability, in thesame degree of good or evil? No, never! And this caste was subsequently cursedand stigmatized only by those who, under I know not what kind of moderninfluences, have considered it as the enemy of men and--science.\" * At the time when Champollion wrote these words, Sanscrit was, we may say, almostan unknown tongue for science. But little in the way of a parallel could havebeen drawn between the respective merits of the Brahmans and the Egyptianphilosophers. Since then, however, it has been discovered that the very sameideas, expressed in almost identical language, may be read in the Buddhistic andBrahmanical literature. This very philosophy of the unreality of mundane thingsand the illusion of the senses--whose whole substance has been plagiarized inour own times by the German metaphysicians--forms the groundwork of Kapila's andVyasa's philosophies, and may be found in Gautama Buddha's enunciation of the\"four truths,\" the cardinal dogmas of his doctrine. Pimander's expression \"he isbecome a god\" is epitomized in the one word, Nirvana, which our learnedOrientalists most incorrectly consider as the synonym of annihilation! This opinion of the two eminent Egyptologists is of the greatest value to us ifit were only as an answer to our opponents. The Champollions were the first inEurope to take the student of archaeology by the hand, and, leading him on intothe silent crypts of the past, prove that civilization did not begin with ourgenerations; for \"though the origins of ancient Egypt are unknown, she is foundto have been at the most distant periods within the reach of historicalresearch, with her great laws, her established customs, her cities, her kings,and gods\"; and behind, far behind, these same epochs we find ruins belonging toother still more distant and higher periods of civilization. \"At Thebes,portions of ruined buildings allow us to recognize remnants of still anteriorstructures, the materials of which had served for the erection of the veryedifices which have now existed for thirty-six centuries!\" ** \"Everything toldus by Herodotus and the Egyptian priests is found to be exact, and has beencorroborated by modern scientists,\" adds Champollion. *** Whence the civilization of the Egyptians came, will be shown in volume II., andin this respect it will be made to appear that our deductions, though based uponthe traditions of the Secret Doctrine, run parallel with those of a number ofmost respected authorities. There is a passage in a well-known Hindu work whichmay well be recalled in this connection. \"Under the reign of Viswamitra, first king of the Dynasty of Soma-Vanga, inconsequence of a battle which lasted five days, Manu-Vina, heir of the ancientkings, being abandoned by the Brahmans, emigrated with all his companions,passing through Arya, and the countries of Barria, till he came to the shores ofMasra\" (History of India, by Collouca-Batta). Unquestionably this Manu-Vina andMenes, the first Egyptian King, are identical. Arya, is Eran (Persia); Barria, is Arabia, and Masra, was the name of Cairo,which to this day is called, Masr, Musr, and Misro. Phoenician history namesMaser as one of the ancestors of Hermes. And now we will bid farewell to thaumatophobia and its advocates, and considerthaumatomania under its multifarious aspects. In vol. II., we intend to reviewthe \"miracles\" of Paganism and weigh the evidence in their favor in the samescales with Christian theology. There is a conflict not merely impending butalready begun between science and theology, on the one hand, and spirit and itshoary science, magic, on the other. Something of the possibilities of the latterhave already been displayed, but more is to come. The petty, mean world, forwhose approving nod scientists and magistrates, priests and Christians compete,have begun their latter-day crusade by sentencing in the same year two innocentmen, one in France, the other in London, in defiance of law and justice. Likethe apostle of circumcision, they are ever ready to thrice deny an unpopularconnection for fear of ostracism by their own fellows. The Psychomantics and thePsychophobists must soon meet in fierce conflict. The anxiety to have theirphenomena investigated and supported by scientific authorities has given placewith the former to a frigid indifference. As a natural result of so muchprejudice and unfairness as have been exhibited, their respect for scientists iswaning fast, and the reciprocal epithets bandied between the two parties arebecoming far from complimentary to either. Which of them is right and whichwrong, time will soon show and future generations understand. It is at leastsafe to prophesy that the Ultima Thule of God's mysteries, and the key to themare to be sought elsewhere than in the whirl of Avogadro's molecules. People who either judge superficially, or, by reason of their natural impatiencewould gaze at the blazing sun before their eyes are well fitted to bearlamp-light, are apt to complain of the exasperating obscurity of language whichcharacterizes the works of the ancient Hermetists and their successors. Theydeclare their philosophical treatises on magic incomprehensible. Over the firstclass we can afford to waste no time; the second, we would beg to moderate theiranxiety, remembering those sayings of Espagnet--\"Truth lies hid in obscurity,\"and \"Philosophers never write more deceitfully than when plainly, nor ever moretruly than when obscurely.\" Furthermore, there is a third class, whom it wouldcompliment too much to say that they judge the subject at all. They simplydenounce ex-cathedra. The ancients they treat as dreamy fools, and though butphysicists and thaumatophobic positivists, they commonly claim a monopoly ofspiritual wisdom! We will select Irenaeus Philaletha to answer this latter class. \"In the worldour writings shall prove a curious-edged knife; to some they shall carve outdainties, but to others they shall only serve to cut their fingers; yet we arenot to be blamed, for we do seriously admonish all who shall attempt this workthat they undertaketh the highest piece of philosophy in nature; and though wewrite in English, yet our matter will be as hard as Greek to some, who willthink, nevertheless, that they understand as well, when they misconstrue ourmeaning most perversely; for is it imaginable that they who are fools in natureshould be wise in books, which are testimonies unto nature?\" The few elevated minds who interrogate nature instead of prescribing laws forher guidance; who do not limit her possibilities by the imperfections of theirown powers; and who only disbelieve because they do not know, we would remind ofthat apothegm of Narada, the ancient Hindu philosopher: \"Never utter these words: 'I do not know this--therefore it is false.' \"\"One must study to know, know to understand, understand to judge.\"END OF VOLUME I.[images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES575:* See Paul to the Galatians, iv., 24, and Gospel according to Matthew, xiii.10-15. 575:** A.

O'Sullivan, the complete works ofLouis Jacolliot in twenty-one volumes. They are chiefly upon India and its oldtraditions, philosophy, and religion. This indefatigable writer has collected aworld of information from various sources, mostly authentic. While we do notaccept his personal views on many points, still we freely acknowledge theextreme value of his copious translations from the Indian sacred books. The moreso, since we find them corroborating in every respect the assertions we havemade. Among other instances is this matter of the submergence of continents inprehistoric days. In his \"Histoire des Vierges: Les Peuples et les Continents Disparus,\" he says:\"One of the most ancient legends of India, preserved in the temples by oral andwritten tradition, relates that several hundred thousand years ago there existedin the Pacific Ocean, an immense continent which was destroyed by geologicalupheaval, and the fragments of which must be sought in Madagascar, Ceylon,Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the principal isles of Polynesia. \"The high plateaux of Hindustan and Asia, according to this hypothesis, wouldonly have been represented in those distant epochs by great islands contiguousto the central continent. . . . According to the Brahmans this country hadattained a high civilization, and the peninsula of Hindustan, enlarged by thedisplacement of the waters, at the time of the grand cataclysm, has butcontinued the chain of the primitive traditions born in this place. Thesetraditions give the name of Rutas to the peoples which inhabited this immenseequinoctial continent, and from their speech was derived the Sanscrit.\" (We willhave something to say of this language in our second volume.) \"The Indo-Hellenic tradition, preserved by the most intelligent population whichemigrated from the plains of India, equally relates the existence of a continentand a people to which it gives the name of Atlantis and Atlantides, and which itlocates in the Atlantic in the northern portion of the Tropics. \"Apart from the fact that the supposition of an ancient continent in thoselatitudes, the vestiges of which may be found in the volcanic islands andmountainous surface of the Azores, the Canaries and Cape Verd, is not devoid ofgeographical probability, the Greeks, who, moreover, never dared to pass beyondthe pillars of Hercules, on account of their dread of the mysterious ocean,appeared too late in antiquity for the stories preserved by Plato to be anythingelse than an echo of the Indian legend. Moreover, when we cast a look on aplanisphere, at the sight of the islands and islets strewn from the MalayanArchipelago to Polynesia, from the straits of Sund to Easter Island, it isimpossible, upon the hypothesis of continents preceding those which we inhabit,not to place there the most important of all. \"A religious belief, common to Malacca and Polynesia, that is to say to the twoopposite extremes of the Oceanic world, affirms 'that all these islands onceformed two immense countries, inhabited by yellow men and black men, always atwar; and that the gods, wearied with their quarrels, having charged Ocean topacify them, the latter swallowed up the two continents, and since, it had beenimpossible to make him give up his captives. Alone, the mountain-peaks and highplateaux escaped the flood, by the power of the gods, who perceived too late themistake they had committed.' p. 595 \"Whatever there may be in these traditions,and whatever may have been the place where a civilization more ancient than thatof Rome, of Greece, of Egypt, and of India was developed, it is certain thatthis civilization did exist, and that it is highly important for science torecover its traces, however feeble and fugitive they may be\" (pp. 13-15). This last tradition, translated by Louis Jacolliot from the Sanscritmanuscripts, corroborates the one we have given from the \"Records of the SecretDoctrine.\" The war mentioned between the yellow and the black men, relates to astruggle between the \"sons of God\" and the \"sons of giants,\" or the inhabitantsand magicians of the Atlantis. The final conclusion of M. Jacolliot, who visited personally all the islands ofPolynesia, and devoted years to the study of the religion, language, andtraditions of nearly all the peoples, is as follows: \"As to the Polynesian continent which disappeared at the time of the finalgeological cataclysms, its existence rests on such proofs that to be logical wecan doubt no longer. \"The three summits of this continent, Sandwich Islands, New Zealand, EasterIsland, are distant from each other from fifteen to eighteen hundred leagues,and the groups of intermediate islands, Viti, Samoa, Tonga, Foutouna, Ouvea,Marquesas, Tahiti, Pournouton, Gambiers, are themselves distant from theseextreme points from seven or eight hundred to one thousand leagues. \"All navigators agree in saying that the extreme and the central groups couldnever have communicated in view of their actual geographical position, and withthe insufficient means they had at hand. It is physically impossible to crosssuch distances in a pirogue . . . without a compass, and travel months withoutprovisions. \"On the other hand, the aborigines of the Sandwich Islands, of Viti, of NewZealand, of the central groups, of Samoa, Tahiti, etc., had never known eachother, had never heard of each other before the arrival of the Europeans. Andyet, each of these people maintained that their island had at one time formed apart of an immense stretch of land which extended toward the West, on the sideof Asia. And all, brought together, were found to speak the same language, tohave the same usages, the same customs, the same religious belief. And all tothe question, 'Where is the cradle of your race?' for sole response, extendedtheir hand toward the setting sun\" (Ibid., p. 308). 596:* These \"magic mirrors,\" generally black, are another proof of theuniversality of an identical belief. In India these mirrors are prepared in theprovince of Agra and are also fabricated in Thibet and China. And we find themin Ancient Egypt, from whence, according to the native historian quoted byBrasseur de Bourbourg, the ancestors of the Quiches brought them to Mexico; thePeruvian sun-worshippers also used it. When the Spaniards had landed, says thehistorian, the King of the Quiches, ordered his priests to consult the mirror,in order to learn the fate of his kingdom. \"The demon reflected the present andthe future as in a mirror,\" he adds (De Bourbourg: \"Mexique,\" p. 184). 597:* Pay'quina, or Payaquina, so called because its waves used to driftparticles of gold from the Brazil.

Where is it?\"--King Henry VI., Act i., Sc. 1.IN the United States of America, sixty thousand (60,428) men are paid salariesto teach the Science of God and His relations to His creatures. These men contract to impart to us the knowledge which treats of the existence,character, and attributes of our Creator; His laws and government; the doctrineswe are to believe and the duties we are to practice. Five thousand (5,141) ofthem, * with the prospect of 1273 theological students to help them in time,teach this science according to a formula prescribed by the Bishop of Rome, tofive million people. Fifty-five thousand (55,287) local and travellingministers, representing fifteen different denominations, **each contradictingthe other upon more or less vital theololical questions, instruct, in theirrespective doctrines, thirty-three million (33,500,000) other persons. Many ofthese teach according to the canons of the cis-Atlantic branch of anestablishment which acknowledges a daughter of the late Duke of Kent as itsspiritualhead. There are many hundred thousand Jews; some thousands of Orientalsof all kinds; and a very few who belong to the Greek Church. A man at Salt LakeCity, with nineteen wives and more than one hundred children and grandchildren,is the supreme spiritual ruler over ninety thousand people, who believe that heis in frequent intercourse with the gods--for the Mormons are Polytheists aswell as Polygamists, and their chief god is represented as living in a planetthey call Colob. The God of the Unitarians is a bachelor; the Deity of the Presbyterians,Methodists, Congregationalists, and the other orthodox Protestant sects aspouseless Father with one Son, who is identical with Himself. In the attempt tooutvie each other in the erection of their sixty-two thousand and odd churches,prayer-houses, and meeting-halls, in which to teach these conflictingtheological doctrines, $354,485,581 have been spent. The value of the Protestantparsonages alone, in which are sheltered the disputants and their families, isroughly calculated to approximate $54,115,297. Sixteen million (16,179,387)dollars, are, moreover, contributed every year for current expenses of theProtestant denominations only. One Presbyterian church in New York cost a roundmillion; a Catholic altar alone, one-fourth as much! We will not mention the multitude of smaller sects, communities, andextravagantly original little heresies in this country which spring up one yearto die out the next, like so many spores of fungi after a rainy day. We will noteven stop to consider the alleged millions of Spiritualists; for the majoritylack the courage to break away from their respective religious denominations.These are the back-door Nicodemuses. And now, with Pilate, let us inquire, What is truth? Where is it to be searchedfor amid this multitude of warring sects? Each claims to be based upon divinerevelation, and each to have the keys of the celestial gates. Is either inpossession of this rare truth? Or, must we exclaim with the Buddhistphilosopher, \"There is but one truth on earth, and it is unchangeable: and thisis--that there is no truth on it!\" Though we have no disposition whatever to trench upon the ground that has beenso exhaustively gleaned by those learned scholars who have shown that everyChristian dogma has its origin in a heathen rite, still the facts which theyhave exhumed, since the enfranchisement of science, will lose nothing byrepetition. Besides, we propose to examine these facts from a different andperhaps rather novel point of view: that of the old philosophies as esotericallyunderstood. These we have barely glanced at in our first volume. We will usethem as the standard by which to compare Christian dogmas and miracles with thedoctrines and phenomena of ancient magic, and the modern \"New Dispensation,\" asSpiritualism is called by its votaries. Since the materialists deny thephenomena without investigation, and since the theologians in admitting themoffer us the poor choice of two palpable absurdities--the Devil and miracles--wecan lose little by applying to the theurgists, and they may actually help us tothrow a great light upon a very dark subject. Professor A. Butlerof, of the Imperial University of St. Petersburg, remarks ina recent pamphlet, entitled Mediumistic Manifestations, as follows: \"Let thefacts (of modern spiritualism) belong if you will to the number of those whichwere more or less known by the ancients; let them be identical with those whichin the dark ages gave importance to the office of Egyptian priest or Romanaugur; let them even furnish the basis of the sorcery of our Siberian Shaman; .. . let them be all these, and, if they are real facts, it is no business ofours. All the facts in nature belong to science, and every addition to the storeof science enriches instead of impoverishing her. If humanity has once admitteda truth, and then in the blindness of self-conceit denied it, to return to itsrealization is a step forward and not backward.\" Since the day that modern science gave what may be considered the death-blow todogmatic theology, by assuming the ground that religion was full of mystery, andmystery is unscientific, the mental state of the educated class has presented acurious aspect. Society seems from that time to have been ever balancing itselfupon one leg, on an unseen tight-rope stretched from our visible universe intothe invisible one; uncertain whether the end hooked on faith in the latter mightnot suddenly break, and hurl it into final annihilation. The great body of nominal Christians may be divided into three unequal portions:materialists, spiritualists, and Christians proper. The materialists andspiritualists make common cause against the hierarchical pretensions of theclergy; who, in retaliation, denounce both with equal acerbity. The materialistsare as little in harmony as the Christian sects themselves--the Comtists, or, asthey call themselves, the positivists, being despised and hated to the lastdegree by the schools of thinkers, one of which Maudsley honorably represents inEngland. Positivism, be it remembered, is that \"religion\" of the future aboutwhose founder even Huxley has made himself wrathful in his famous lecture, ThePhysical Basis of Life; and Maudsley felt obliged, in behalf of modern science,to express himself thus: \"It is no wonder that scientific men should be anxiousto disclaim Comte as their law-giver, and to protest against such a king beingset up to reign over them. Not conscious of any personal obligation to hiswritings--conscious how much, in some respects, he has misrepresented the spiritand pretensions of science--they repudiate the allegiance which his enthusiasticdisciples would force upon them, and which popular opinion is fast coming tothink a natural one. They do well in thus making a timely assertion ofindependence; for if it be not done soon, it will soon be too late to be donewell.\" *When a materialistic doctrine is repudiated so strongly by two suchmaterialists as Huxley and Maudsley, then we must think indeed that it isabsurdity itself. Among Christians there is nothing but dissension. Their various churchesrepresent every degree of religious belief, from the omnivorous credulity ofblind faith to a condescending and high-toned deference to the Deity whichthinly masks an evident conviction of their own deific wisdom. All these sectsbelieve more or less in the immortality of the soul. Some admit the intercoursebetween the two worlds as a fact; some entertain the opinion as a sentiment;some positively deny it; and only a few maintain an attitude of attention andexpectancy. Impatient of restraint, longing for the return of the dark ages, the RomishChurch frowns at the diabolical manifestations, and indicates what she would doto their champions had she but the power of old. Were it not for theself-evident fact that she herself is placed by science on trial, and that sheis handcuffed, she would be ready at a moment's notice to repeat in thenineteenth century the revolting scenes of former days. As to the Protestantclergy, so furious is their common hatred toward spiritualism, that as a secularpaper very truly remarks: \"They seem willing to undermine the public faith inall the spiritual phenomena of the past, as recorded in the Bible, if they canonly see the pestilent modern heresy stabbed to the heart.\" ** Summoning back the long-forgotten memories of the Mosaic laws, the Romish Churchclaims the monopoly of miracles, and of the right to sit in judgment over them,as being the sole heir thereto by direct inheritance. The Old Testament, exiledby Colenso, his predecessors and contemporaries, is recalled from itsbanishment. The prophets, whom his Holiness the Pope condescends at last toplace, if not on the same level with himself, at least at a less respectfuldistance, *** are dusted and cleaned. The memory of all the diabolicalabracadabra is evoked anew. The blasphemous horrors perpetrated by Paganism, itsphallic worship, thaumaturgical wonders wrought by Satan, human sacrifices,incantations, witchcraft, magic, and sorcery are recalled and DEMONISM isconfronted with spiritualism for mutual recognition and identification. Ourmodern demonologists conveniently overlook a few insignificant details, amongwhich is the undeniable presence of heathen phallism in the Christian symbols. Astrong spiritual element of this worship may be easily demonstrated in the dogmaof the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mother of God; and a physical elementequally proved in the fetish-worship of the holy limbs of Sts. Cosmo andDamiano, at Isernia, near Naples; a successful traffic in which ex-voto in waxwas carried on by the clergy, annually, until barely a half century ago. * We find it rather unwise on the part of Catholic writers to pour out their vialsof wrath in such sentences as these: \"In a multitude of pagodas, the phallicstone, ever and always assuming, like the Grecian batylos, the brutally indecentform of the lingham . . . the Maha Deva.\" ** Before casting slurs on a symbolwhose profound metaphysical meaning is too much for the modern champions of thatreligion of sensualism par excellence, Roman Catholicism, to grasp, they are induty bound to destroy their oldest churches, and change the form of the cupolasof their own temples. The Mahody of Elephanta, the Round Tower of Bhangulpore,the minarets of Islam--either rounded or pointed--are the originals of theCampanile column of San Marco, at Venice, of the Rochester Cathedral, and of themodern Duomo of Milan. All of these steeples, turrets, domes, and Christiantemples, are the reproductions of the primitive idea of the lithos, the uprightphallus. \"The western tower of St. Paul's Cathedral, London,\" says the author ofThe Rosicrucians, \"is one of the double lithoi placed always in front of everytemple, Christian as well as heathen.\" *** Moreover, in all Christian Churches,\"particularly in Protestant churches, where they figure most conspicuously, thetwo tables of stone of the Mosaic Dispensation are placed over the altar, sideby side, as a united stone, the tops of which are rounded. . . . The right stoneis masculine, the left feminine.\" Therefore neither Catholics nor Protestantshave a right to talk of the \"indecent forms\" of heathen monuments so long asthey ornament their own churches with the symbols of the Lingham and Yoni, andeven write the laws of their God upon them. Another detail not redounding very particularly to the honor of the Christianclergy might be recalled in the word Inquisition. The torrents of human bloodshed by this Christian institution, and the number of its human sacrifices, areunparalleled in the annals of Paganism. Another still more prominent feature inwhich the clergy surpassed their masters, the \"heathen,\" is sorcery. Certainlyin no Pagan temple was black magic, in its real and true sense, more practicedthan in the Vatican. While strongly supporting exorcism as an important sourceof revenue, they neglected magic as little as the ancient heathen. It is easy toprove that the sortilegium, or sorcery, was widely practiced among the clergyand monks so late as the last century, and is practiced occasionally even now. Anathematizing every manifestation of occult nature outside the precincts of theChurch, the clergy--notwithstanding proofs to the contrary--call it \"the work ofSatan,\" \"the snares of the fallen angels,\" who \"rush in and out from thebottomless pit,\" mentioned by John in his kabalistic Revelation, \"from whencearises a smoke as the smoke of a great furnace.\" \"Intoxicated by its fumes,around this pit are daily gathering millions of Spiritualists, to worship at'the Abyss of Baal.' \" * More than ever arrogant, stubborn, and despotic, now that she has been nearlyupset by modern research, not daring to interfere with the powerful champions ofscience, the Latin Church revenges herself upon the unpopular phenomena. Adespot without a victim, is a word void of sense; a power which neglects toassert itself through outward, well-calculated effects, risks being doubted inthe end. The Church has no intention to fall into the oblivion of the ancientmyths, or to suffer her authority to be too closely questioned. Hence shepursues, as well as the times permit, her traditional policy. Lamenting theenforced extinction of her ally, the Holy Inquisition, she makes a virtue ofnecessity. The only victims now within reach are the Spiritists of France.Recent events have shown that the meek spouse of Christ never disdains toretaliate on helpless victims. Having successfully performed her part of Deus-ex-Machina from behind the FrenchBench, which has not scrupled to disgrace itself for her, the Church of Romesets to work and shows in the year 1876 what she can do. From the whirlingtables and dancing pencils of profane Spiritualism, the Christian world iswarned to turn to the divine \"miracles\" of Lourdes. Meanwhile, theecclesiastical authorities utilize their time in arranging for other more easytriumphs, calculated to scare the superstitious out of their senses. So, actingunder orders, the clergy hurl dramatic, if not very impressive anathemas fromevery Catholic diocese; threaten right and left; excommunicate and curse.Perceiving, finally, that her thunderbolts directed even against crowned headsfall about as harmlessly as the Jupiterean lightnings of Offenbach's Calchas,Rome turns about in powerless fury against the victimized proteges of theEmperor of Russia--the unfortunate Bulgarians and Servians. Undisturbed byevidence and sarcasm, unbaffled by proof, \"the lamb of the Vatican\" impartiallydivides his wrath between the liberals of Italy, \"the impious whose breath hasthe stench of the sepulchre,\" *the \"schismatic Russian Sarmates,\" and theheretics and spiritualists, \"who worship at the bottomless pit where the greatDragon lies in wait.\" Mr. Gladstone went to the trouble of making a catalogue of what he terms the\"flowers of speech,\" disseminated through these Papal discourses. Let us cull afew of the chosen terms used by this vicegerent of Him who said that, \"whosoevershall say Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire.\" They are selected fromauthentic discourses. Those who oppose the Pope are \"wolves, Pharisees, thieves,liars, hypocrites, dropsical children of Satan, sons of perdition, of sin, andcorruption, satellites of Satan in human flesh, monsters of hell, demonsincarnate, stinking corpses, men issued from the pits of hell, traitors andJudases led by the spirit of hell; children of the deepest pits of hell,\" etc.,etc.; the whole piously collected and published by Don Pasquale di Franciscis,whom Gladstone has, with perfect propriety, termed, \"an accomplished professorof flunkeyism in things spiritual.\" ** Since his Holiness the Pope has such a rich vocabulary of invectives at hiscommand, why wonder that the Bishop of Toulouse did not scruple to utter themost undignified falsehoods about the Protestants and Spiritualists ofAmerica--people doubly odious to a Catholic--in his address to his diocese:\"Nothing,\" he remarks, \"is more common in an era of unbelief than to see a falserevelation substitute itself for the true one, and minds neglect the teachingsof the Holy Church, to devote themselves to the study of divination and theoccult sciences.\" With a fine episcopal contempt for statistics, and strangelyconfounding in his memory the audiences of the revivalists, Moody and Sankey,and the patrons of darkened seance-rooms, he utters the unwarranted andfallacious assertion that \"it has been proven that Spiritualism, in the UnitedStates, has caused one-sixth of all the cases of suicide and insanity.\" He saysthat it is not possible that the spirits \"teach either an exact science, becausethey are lying demons, or a useful science, because the character of the word ofSatan, like Satan himself, is sterile.\" He warns his dear collaborateurs, that\"the writings in favor of Spiritualism are under the ban\"; and he advises themto let it be known that \"to frequent spiritual circles with the intention ofaccepting the doctrine, is to apostatize from the Holy Church, and assume therisk of excommunication\"; finally, says he, \"Publish the fact that the teachingof no spirit should prevail against that of the pulpit of Peter, which is theteaching of the Spirit of God Himself\"!! Aware of the many false teachings attributed by the Roman Church to the Creator,we prefer disbelieving the latter assertion. The famous Catholic theologian,Tillemont, assures us in his work that \"all the illustrious Pagans are condemnedto the eternal torments of hell, because they lived before the time of Jesus,and, therefore, could not be benefited by the redemption\"!! He also assures usthat the Virgin Mary personally testified to this truth over her own signaturein a letter to a saint. Therefore, this is also a revelation--\"the Spirit of GodHimself\" teaching such charitable doctrines. We have also read with great advantage the topographical descriptions of Helland Purgatory in the celebrated treatise under that name by a Jesuit, theCardinal Bellarmin. A critic found that the author, who gives the descriptionfrom a divine vision with which he was favored, \"appears to possess all theknowledge of a land-measurer\" about the secret tracts and formidable divisionsof the \"bottomless pit.\" Justin Martyr having actually committed to paper theheretical thought that after all Socrates might not be altogether fixed in hell,his Benedictine editor criticises this too benevolent father very severely.Whoever doubts the Christian charity of the Church of Rome in this direction isinvited to peruse the Censure of the Sorbonne, on Marmontel's Belisarius. Theodium theologicum blazes in it on the dark sky of orthodox theology like anaurora borealis--the precursor of God's wrath, according to the teaching ofcertain mediaeval divines. We have attempted in the first part of this work to show, by historicalexamples, how completely men of science have deserved the stinging sarcasm ofthe late Professor de Morgan, who remarked of them that \"they wear the priest'scast-off garb, dyed to escape detection.\" The Christian clergy are, in likemanner, attired in the cast-off garb of the heathen priesthood; actingdiametrically in opposition to their God's moral precepts, but nevertheless,sitting in judgment over the whole world. When dying on the cross, the martyred Man of Sorrows forgave his enemies. Hislast words were a prayer in their behalf. He taught his disciples to curse not,but to bless, even their foes. But the heirs of St. Peter, the self-constitutedrepresentatives on earth of that same meek Jesus, unhesitatingly curse whoeverresists their despotic will. Besides, was not the \"Son\" long since crowded bythem into the background? They make their obeisance only to the Dowager Mother,for--according to their teaching--again through \"the direct Spirit of God,\" shealone acts as a mediatrix. The Œcumenical Council of 1870 embodied the teachinginto a dogma, to disbelieve which is to be doomed forever to the 'bottomlesspit.' The work of Don Pasquale di Franciscis is positive on that point; for hetells us that, as the Queen of Heaven owes to the present Pope \"the finest gemin her coronet,\" since he has conferred on her the unexpected honor of becomingsuddenly immaculate, there is nothing she cannot obtain from her Son for \"herChurch.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu100.htm#fn_11] Some years ago, certain travellers saw in Barri, Italy, a statue of the Madonna,arrayed in a flounced pink skirt over a swelling crinoline! Pious pilgrims whomay be anxious to examine the regulation wardrobe of their God's mother may doso by going to Southern Italy, Spain, and Catholic North and South America. TheMadonna of Barri must still be there--between two vineyards and a locanda(gin-shop). When last seen, a half-successful attempt had been made to clothethe infant Jesus; they had covered his legs with a pair of dirty, scollop-edgedpantaloons. An English traveller having presented the \"Mediatrix\" with a greensilk parasol, the grateful population of the contadini, accompanied by thevillage-priest, went in procession to the spot. They managed to stick thesunshade, opened, between the infant's back and the arm of the Virgin whichembraced him. The scene and ceremony were both solemn and highly refreshing toour religious feelings. For there stood the image of the goddess in its niche,surrounded with a row of ever-burning lamps, the flames of which, flickering inthe breeze, infect God's pure air with an offensive smell of olive oil. TheMother and Son truly represent the two most conspicuous idols of MonotheisticChristianity! For a companion to the idol of the poor contadini of Barri, go to the rich cityof Rio Janeiro. In the Church of the Duomo del Candelaria, in a long hallrunning along one side of the church, there might be seen, a few years ago,another Madonna. Along the walls of the hall there is a line of saints, eachstanding on a contribution-box, which thus forms a fit pedestal. In the centreof this line, under a gorgeously rich canopy of blue silk, is exhibited theVirgin Mary leaning on the arm of Christ. \"Our Lady\" is arrayed in a verydecollete blue satin dress with short sleeves, showing, to great advantage, asnow-white, exquisitely-moulded neck, shoulders, and arms. The skirt equally ofblue satin with an overskirt of rich lace and gauze puffs, is as short as thatof a ballet-dancer; hardly reaching the knee, it exhibits a pair offinely-shaped legs covered with flesh colored silk tights, and blue satin Frenchboots with very high red heels! The blonde hair of this \"Mother of God\" isarranged in the latest fashion, with a voluminous chignon and curls. As sheleans on her Son's arm, her face is lovingly turned toward her Only-Begotten,whose dress and attitude are equally worthy of admiration. Christ wears anevening dress-coat, with swallow-tail, black trousers, and low cut white vest;varnished boots, and white kid gloves, over one of which sparkles a rich diamondring, worth many thousands we must suppose--a precious Brazilian jewel. Abovethis body of a modern Portuguese dandy, is a head with the hair parted in themiddle; a sad and solemn face, and eyes whose patient look seems to reflect allthe bitterness of this last insult flung at the majesty of the Crucified. * The Egyptian Isis was also represented as a Virgin Mother by her devotees, andas holding her infant son, Horus, in her arms. In some statues andbasso-relievos, when she appears alone she is either completely nude or veiledfrom head to foot. But in the Mysteries, in common with nearly every othergoddess, she is entirely veiled from head to foot, as a symbol of a mother'schastity. It would not do us any harm were we to borrow from the ancients someof the poetic sentiment in their religions, and the innate veneration theyentertained for their symbols. It is but fair to say at once that the last of the true Christians died with thelast of the direct apostles. Max Muller forcibly asks: \"How can a missionary insuch circumstances meet the surprise and questions of his pupils, unless he maypoint to that seed, **and tell them what Christianity was meant to be? unless hemay show that, like all other religions, Christianity too, has had its history;that the Christianity of the nineteenth century is not the Christianity of themiddle ages, and that the Christianity of the middle ages was not that of theearly Councils; that the Christianity of the early Councils was not that of theApostles, and that what has been said by Christ, that alone was well said?\" *** Thus we may infer that the only characteristic difference between modernChristianity and the old heathen faiths is the belief of the former in apersonal devil and in hell. \"The Aryan nations had no devil,\" says Max Muller.\"Pluto, though of a sombre character, was a very respectable personage; and Loki(the Scandinavian), though a mischievous person, was not a fiend. The GermanGoddess, Hell, too, like Proserpine, had once seen better days. Thus, when theGermans were indoctrinated with the idea of a real devil, the Semitic Seth,Satan or Diabolus, they treated him in the most good-humored way.\" The same may be said of hell. Hades was quite a different place from our regionof eternal damnation, and might be termed rather an intermediate state ofpurification. Neither does the Scandinavian Hel or Hela, imply either a state ora place of punishment; for when Frigga, the grief-stricken mother of Bal-dur,the white god, who died and found himself in the dark abodes of the shadows(Hades) sent Hermod, a son of Thor, in quest of her beloved child, the messengerfound him in the inexorable region--alas! but still comfortably seated on arock, and reading a book. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu100.htm#fn_15]The Norse kingdom of the dead is moreover situated in the higher latitudes ofthe Polar regions; it is a cold and cheerless abode, and neither the gelid hallsof Hela, nor the occupation of Baldur present the least similitude to theblazing hell of eternal fire and the miserable \"damned\" sinners with which theChurch so generously peoples it. No more is it the Egyptian Amenthes, the regionof judgment and purification; nor the Onderah--the abyss of darkness of theHindus; for even the fallen angels hurled into it by Siva, are allowed byParabrahma to consider it as an intermediate state, in which an opportunity isafforded them to prepare for higher degrees of purification and redemption fromtheir wretched condition. The Gehenna of the New Testament was a localityoutside the walls of Jerusalem; and in mentioning it, Jesus used but an ordinarymetaphor. Whence then came the dreary dogma of hell, that Archimedean lever ofChristian theology, with which they have succeeded to hold in subjection thenumberless millions of Christians for nineteen centuries? Assuredly not from theJewish Scriptures, and we appeal for corroboration to any well-informed Hebrewscholar. The only designation of something approaching hell in the Bible is Gehenna orHinnom, a valley near Jerusalem, where was situated Tophet, a place where a firewas perpetually kept for sanitary purposes. The prophet Jeremiah informs us thatthe Israelites used to sacrifice their children to Moloch-Hercules on that spot;and later we find Christians quietly replacing this divinity by their god ofmercy, whose wrath will not be appeased, unless the Church sacrifices to him herunbaptized children and sinning sons on the altar of \"eternal damnation\"! Whence then did the divine learn so well the conditions of hell, as to actuallydivide its torments into two kinds, the poena damni and poenae sensus, theformer being the privation of the beatific vision; the latter the eternal painsin a lake of fire and brimstone? If they answer us that it is in the Apocalypse(xx. 10), we are prepared to demonstrate whence the theologist John himselfderived the idea, \"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake offire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are and shall betormented for ever and ever,\" he says. Laying aside the esoteric interpretationthat the \"devil\" or tempting demon meant our own earthly body, which after deathwill surely dissolve in the fiery or ethereal elements, * the word \"eternal\" bywhich our theologians interpret the words \"for ever and ever\" does not exist inthe Hebrew language, either as a word or meaning. There is no Hebrew word whichproperly expresses eternity; [images/00020.jpg]oulam, according to Le Clerc,only imports a time whose beginning or end is not known. While showing that thisword does not mean infinite duration, and that in the Old Testament the wordforever only signifies a long time, Archbishop Tillotson has completelyperverted its sense with respect to the idea of hell-torments. According to hisdoctrine, when Sodom and Gomorrah are said to be suffering \"eternal fire,\" wemust understand it only in the sense of that fire not being extinguished tillboth cities were entirely consumed. But, as to hell-fire the words must beunderstood in the strictest sense of infinite duration. Such is the decree ofthe learned divine. For the duration of the punishment of the wicked must beproportionate to the eternal happiness of the righteous. So he says, \"These(speaking of the wicked) shall go away εις κολασιν αιονιον into eternalpunishment; but the righteous εις ζοεν αιονιον into life eternal.\" The Reverend T. Surnden, **commenting on the speculations of his predecessors,fills a whole volume with unanswerable arguments, tending to show that thelocality of Hell is in the sun. We suspect that the reverend speculator had readthe Apocalypse in bed, and had the nightmare in consequence. There are twoverses in the Revelation of John reading thus: \"And the fourth angel poured outhis vial upon the sun, and power was given him to scorch men with fire. And menwere scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God.\" *** This issimply Pythagorean and kabalistic allegory. The idea is new neither with theabove-mentioned author nor with John. Pythagoras placed the \"sphere ofpurification in the sun,\" which sun, with its sphere, he moreover locates in themiddle of the universe, *the allegory having a double meaning: 1. Symbolically,the central, spiritual sun, the Supreme Deity. Arrived at this region every soulbecomes purified of its sins, and unites itself forever with its spirit, havingpreviously suffered throughout all the lower spheres. 2. By placing the sphereof visible fire in the middle of the universe, he simply taught the heliocentricsystem which appertained to the Mysteries, and was imparted only in the higherdegree of initiation. John gives to his Word a purely kabalistic significance,which no \"Fathers,\" except those who had belonged to the Neo-platonic school,were able to comprehend. Origen understood it well, having been a pupil ofAmmonius Saccas; therefore we see him bravely denying the perpetuity ofhell-torments. He maintains that not only men, but even devils (by which term hemeant disembodied human sinners), after a certain duration of punishment shallbe pardoned and finally restored to heaven. ** In consequence of this and othersuch heresies Origen was, as a matter of course, exiled. Many have been the learned and truly-inspired speculations as to the locality ofhell. The most popular were those which placed it in the centre of the earth. Ata certain time, however, skeptical doubts which disturbed the placidity of faithin this highly-refreshing doctrine arose in consequence of the meddlingscientists of those days. As a Mr. Swinden in our own century observes, thetheory was inadmissible because of two objections: 1st, that a fund of fuel orsulphur sufficient to maintain so furious and constant a fire could not be theresupposed; and, 2d, that it must want the nitrous particles in the air to sustainand keep it alive. \"And how,\" says he, \"can a fire be eternal, when, by degrees,the whole substance of the earth must be consumed thereby?\" *** The skeptical gentleman had evidently forgotten that centuries ago St. Augustinesolved the difficulty. Have we not the word of this learned divine that hell,nevertheless, is in the centre of the earth, for \"God supplies the central firewith air by a miracle\"? The argument is unanswerable, and so we will not seek toupset it. The Christians were the first to make the existence of Satan a dogma of theChurch. And once that she had established it, she had to struggle for over 1,700years for the repression of a mysterious force which it was her policy to makeappear of diabolical origin. Unfortunately, in manifesting itself, this forceinvariably tends to upset such a belief by the ridiculous discrepancy itpresents between the alleged cause and the effects. If the clergy have notover-estimated the real power of the \"Arch-Enemy of God,\" it must be confessedthat he takes mighty precautions against being recognized as the \"Prince ofDarkness\" who aims at our souls. If modern \"spirits\" are devils at all, aspreached by the clergy, then they can only be those \"poor\" or \"stupid devils\"whom Max Muller describes as appearing so often in the German and Norwegiantales. Notwithstanding this, the clergy fear above all to be forced to relinquish thishold on humanity. They are not willing to let us judge of the tree by itsfruits, for that might sometimes force them into dangerous dilemmas. Theyrefuse, likewise, to admit, with unprejudiced people, that the phenomena ofSpiritualism has unquestionably spiritualized and reclaimed from evil coursesmany an indomitable atheist and skeptic. But, as they confess themselves, whatis the use in a Pope, if there is no Devil? And so Rome sends her ablest advocates and preachers to the rescue of thoseperishing in \"the bottomless pit.\" Rome employs her cleverest writers for thispurpose--albeit they all indignantly deny the accusation--and in the preface toevery book put forth by the prolific des Mousseaux, the French Tertullian of ourcentury, we find undeniable proofs of the fact. Among other certificates ofecclesiastical approval, every volume is ornamented with the text of a certainoriginal letter addressed to the very pious author by the world-known FatherVentura de Raulica, of Rome. Few are those who have not heard this famous name.It is the name of one of the chief pillars of the Latin Church, the ex-Generalof the Order of the Theatins, Consultor of the Sacred Congregation of Rites,Examiner of Bishops, and of the Roman Clergy, etc., etc., etc. This strikinglycharacteristic document will remain to astonish future generations by its spiritof unsophisticated demonolatry and unblushing sincerity. We translate a fragmentverbatim, and by thus helping its circulation hope to merit the blessings ofMother Church: * \"MONSIEUR AND EXCELLENT FRIEND:\"The greatest victory of Satan was gained on that day when he succeeded inmaking himself denied.\"To demonstrate the existence of Satan, is to reestablish one of the fundamentaldogmas of the Church, which serve as a basis for Christianity, and, withoutwhich, Satan would be but a name. . . .\"Magic, mesmerism, magnetism, somnambulism, spiritualism, spiritism, hypnotism .. . are only other names for SATANISM.\"To bring out such a truth and show it in its proper light, is to unmask theenemy; it is to unveil the immense danger of certain practices, reputedinnocent; it is to deserve well in the eyes of humanity and of religion.\"FATHER VENTURA DE RAULICA.\"A--men!This is an unexpected honor indeed, for our American \"controls\" in general, andthe innocent \"Indian guides\" in particular. To be thus introduced in Rome asprinces of the Empire of Eblis, is more than they could ever hope for in otherlands. Without in the least suspecting that she was working for the future welfare ofher enemies--the spiritualists and spiritists--the Church, some twenty yearssince, in tolerating des Mousseaux and de Mirville as the biographers of theDevil, and giving her approbation thereto, tacitly confessed the literarycopartnership. M. the Chevalier Gougenot des Mousseaux, and his friend and collaborateur, theMarquis Eudes de Mirville, to judge by their long titles, must be aristocratspur sang, and they are, moreover, writers of no small erudition and talent. Werethey to show themselves a little more parsimonious of double points ofexclamation following every vituperation, and invective against Satan and hisworshippers, their style would be faultless. As it is, the crusade against theenemy of mankind was fierce, and lasted for over twenty years. What with the Catholics piling up their psychological phenomena to prove theexistence of a personal devil, and the Count de Gasparin, an ancient minister ofLouis Philippe, collecting volumes of other facts to prove the contrary, thespiritists of France have contracted an everlasting debt of gratitude toward thedisputants. The existence of an unseen spiritual universe peopled with invisiblebeings has now been demonstrated beyond question. Ransacking the oldestlibraries, they have distilled from the historical records the quintessence ofevidence. All epochs, from the Homeric ages down to the present day, havesupplied their choicest materials to these indefatigable authors. In trying toprove the authenticity of the miracles wrought by Satan in the days precedingthe Christian era, as well as throughout the middle ages, they have simply laida firm foundation for a study of the phenomena in our modern times. Though an ardent, uncompromising enthusiast, des Mousseaux unwittinglytransforms himself into the tempting demon, or--as he is fond of calling theDevil--the \"serpent of Genesis.\" In his desire to demonstrate in everymanifestation the presence of the Evil One, he only succeeds in demonstratingthat Spiritualism and magic are no new things in the world, but very ancienttwin-brothers, whose origin must be sought for in the earliest infancy ofancient India, Chaldea, Babylonia, Egypt, Persia, and Greece. He proves the existence of \"spirits,\" whether these be angels or devils, withsuch a clearness of argument and logic, and such an amount of evidence,historical, irrefutable, and strictly authenticated, that little is left forspiritualist authors who may come after him. How unfortunate that thescientists, who believe neither in devil nor spirit, are more than likely toridicule M. des Mousseaux's books without reading them, for they really containso many facts of profound scientific interest! But what can we expect in our own age of unbelief, when we find Plato, overtwenty-two centuries ago, complaining of the same? \"Me, too,\" says he, in hisEuthyphron, \"when I say anything in the public assembly concerning divinethings, and predict to them what is going to happen, they ridicule as mad; andalthough nothing that I have predicted has proved untrue, yet they envy all suchmen as we are. However, we ought not to heed, but pursue our own way.\" The literary resources of the Vatican and other Catholic repositories oflearning must have been freely placed at the disposal of these modern authors.When one has such treasures at hand--original manuscripts, papyri, and bookspillaged from the richest heathen libraries; old treatises on magic and alchemy;and records of all the trials for witchcraft, and sentences for the same torack, stake, and torture, it is mighty easy to write volumes of accusationsagainst the Devil. We affirm on good grounds that there are hundreds of the mostvaluable works on the occult sciences, which are sentenced to eternalconcealment from the public, but are attentively read and studied by theprivileged who have access to the Vatican Library. The laws of nature are thesame for heathen sorcerer as for Catholic saint; and a \"miracle\" may be producedas well by one as by the other, without the slightest intervention of God ordevil. Hardly had the manifestations begun to attract attention in Europe, than theclergy commenced their outcry that their traditional enemy had reappeared underanother name, and \"divine miracles\" also began to be heard of in isolatedinstances. First they were confined to humble individuals, some of whom claimedto have them produced through the intervention of the Virgin Mary, saints andangels; others--according to the clergy--began to suffer from obsession andpossession; for the Devil must have his share of fame as well as the Deity.Finding that, notwithstanding the warning, the independent, or so-calledspiritual phenomena went on increasing and multiplying, and that thesemanifestations threatened to upset the carefully-constructed dogmas of theChurch, the world was suddenly startled by extraordinary intelligence. In 1864,a whole community became possessed of the Devil. Morzine, and the awful storiesof its demoniacs; Valleyres, and the narratives of its well-authenticatedexhibitions of sorcery; and those of the Presbytere de Cideville curdled theblood in Catholic veins. Strange to say, the question has been asked over and over again, why the\"divine\" miracles and most of the obsessions are so strictly confined to RomanCatholic dioceses and countries? Why is it that since the Reformation there hasbeen scarcely one single divine \"miracle\" in a Protestant land? Of course, theanswer we must expect from Catholics is, that the latter are peopled byheretics, and abandoned by God. Then why are there no more Church-miracles inRussia, a country whose religion differs from the Roman Catholic faith but inexternal forms of rites, its fundamental dogmas being identically the same,except as to the emanation of the Holy Ghost? Russia has her accepted saints andthaumaturgical relics, and miracle-working images. The St. Mitrophaniy ofVoroneg is an authenticated miracle-worker, but his miracles are limited tohealing; and though hundreds upon hundreds have been healed through faith, andthough the old cathedral is full of magnetic effluvia, and whole generationswill go on believing in his power, and some persons will always be healed, stillno such miracles are heard of in Russia as the Madonna-walking, and Madonnaletter-writing, and statue-talking of Catholic countries. Why is this so? Simplybecause the emperors have strictly forbidden that sort of thing. The Czar, Peterthe Great, stopped every spurious \"divine\" miracle with one frown of his mightybrow. He declared he would have no false miracles played by the holy icones(images of saints), and they disappeared forever. * There are cases on record of isolated and independent phenomena exhibited bycertain images in the last century; the latest was the bleeding of the cheek ofan image of the Virgin, when a soldier of Napoleon cut her face in two. Thismiracle, alleged to have happened in 1812, in the days of the invasion by the\"grand army,\" was the final farewell. ** But since then, although the three successive emperors have been pious men,their will has been respected, and the images and saints have remained quiet,and hardly been spoken of except as connected with religious worship. In Poland,a land of furious ultramontanism, there were, at different times, desperateattempts at miracle-doing. They died at birth, however, for the argus-eyedpolice were there; a Catholic miracle in Poland, made public by the priests,generally meaning political revolution, bloodshed, and war. Is it then, not permissible to at least suspect that if, in one country divinemiracles may be arrested by civil and military law, and in another they neveroccur, we must search for the explanation of the two facts in some naturalcause, instead of attributing them to either god or devil? In our opinion--if itis worth anything--the whole secret may be accounted for as follows. In Russia,the clergy know better than to bewilder their parishes, whose piety is sincereand faith strong without miracles; they know that nothing is better calculatedthan the latter to sow seeds of distrust, doubt, and finally of skepticism whichleads directly to atheism. Moreover the climate is less propitious, and themagnetism of the average population too positive, too healthy, to call forthindependent phenomena; and fraud would not answer. On the other hand, neither inProtestant Germany, nor England, nor yet in America, since the days of theReformation, has the clergy had access to any of the Vatican secret libraries.Hence they are all but poor hands at the magic of Albertus Magnus. As for America being overflowed with sensitives and mediums, the reason for itis partially attributable to climatic influence and especially to thephysiological condition of the population. Since the days of the Salemwitchcraft, 200 years ago, when the comparatively few settlers had pure andunadulterated blood in their veins, nothing much had been heard of \"spirits\" or\"mediums\" until 1840. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu100.htm#fn_25] Thephenomena then first appeared among the ascetic and exalted Shakers, whosereligious aspirations, peculiar mode of life, moral purity, and physicalchastity all led to the production of independent phenomena of a psychologicalas well as physical nature. Hundreds of thousands, and even millions of men fromvarious climates and of different constitutions and habits, have, since 1692,invaded North America, and by intermarrying have substantially changed thephysical type of the inhabitants. Of what country in the world do the women'sconstitutions bear comparison with the delicate, nervous, and sensitiveconstitutions of the feminine portion of the population of the United States? Wewere struck on our arrival in the country with the semi-transparent delicacy ofskin of the natives of both sexes. Compare a hard-working Irish factory girl orboy, with one from a genuine American family. Look at their hands. One works ashard as the other; they are of equal age, and both seemingly healthy; and still,while the hands of the one, after an hour's soaping, will show a skin littlesofter than that of a young alligator, those of the other, notwithstandingconstant use, will allow you to observe the circulation of the blood under thethin and delicate epidermis. No wonder, then, that while America is theconservatory of sensitives the majority of its clergy, unable to produce divineor any other miracles, stoutly deny the possibility of any phenomena exceptthose produced by tricks and juggling. And no wonder also that the Catholicpriesthood, who are practically aware of the existence of magic and spiritualphenomena, and believe in them while dreading their consequences, try toattribute the whole to the agency of the Devil. Let us adduce one more argument, if only for the sake of circumstantialevidence. In what countries have \"divine miracles\" flourished most, been mostfrequent and most stupendous? Catholic Spain, and Pontifical Italy, beyondquestion. And which more than these two, has had access to ancient literature?Spain was famous for her libraries; the Moors were celebrated for their profoundlearning in alchemy and other sciences. The Vatican is the storehouse of animmense number of ancient manuscripts. During the long interval of nearly 1,500years they have been accumulating, from trial after trial, books and manuscriptsconfiscated from their sentenced victims, to their own profit. The Catholics mayplead that the books were generally committed to the flames; that the treatisesof famous sorcerers and enchanters perished with their accursed authors. But theVatican, if it could speak, could tell a different story. It knows too well ofthe existence of certain closets and rooms, access to which is had but by thevery few. It knows that the entrances to these secret hiding-places are socleverly concealed from sight in the carved frame-work and under the profuseornamentation of the library-walls, that there have even been Popes who livedand died within the precincts of the palace without ever suspecting theirexistence. But these Popes were neither Sylvester II., Benedict IX., John XX.,nor the VIth and VIIth Gregory; nor yet the famous Borgia of toxicologicalmemory. Neither were those who remained ignorant of the hidden lore friends ofthe sons of Loyola. Where, in the records of European Magic, can we find cleverer enchanters than inthe mysterious solitudes of the cloister? Albert Magnus, the famous Bishop andconjurer of Ratisbon, was never surpassed in his art. Roger Bacon was a monk,and Thomas Aquinas one of the most learned pupils of Albertus. Trithemius,Abbott of the Spanheim Benedictines, was the teacher, friend, and confidant ofCornelius Agrippa; and while the confederations of the Theosophists werescattered broadcast about Germany, where they first originated, assisting oneanother, and struggling for years for the acquirement of esoteric knowledge, anyperson who knew how to become the favored pupil of certain monks, might verysoon be proficient in all the important branches of occult learning. This is all in history and cannot be easily denied. Magic, in all its aspects,was widely and nearly openly practiced by the clergy till the Reformation. Andeven he who was once called the \"Father of the Reformation,\" the famous JohnReuchlin, * author of the Mirific Word and friend of Pico di Mirandola, theteacher and instructor of Erasmus, Luther, and Melancthon, was a kabalist andoccultist. The ancient Sortilegium, or divination by means of Sortes or lots--an art andpractice now decried by the clergy as an abomination, designated by Stat. 10Jac. as felony, ** and by Stat. 12 Carolus II excepted out of the generalpardons, on the ground of being sorcery--was widely practiced by the clergy andmonks. Nay, it was sanctioned by St. Augustine himself, who does not \"disapproveof this method of learning futurity, provided it be not used for worldlypurposes.\" More than that, he confesses having practiced it himself. *** Aye; but the clergy called it Sortes Sanctorum, when it was they who practicedit; while the Sortes Praenestinae, succeeded by the Sortes Homericae and SortesVirgilianae, were abominable heathenism, the worship of the Devil, when used byany one else. Gregory de Tours informs us that when the clergy resorted to the Sortes theircustom was to lay the Bible on the altar, and to pray the Lord that He woulddiscover His will, and disclose to them futurity in one of the verses of thebook. Gilbert de Nogent writes that in his days (about the twelfth century) thecustom was, at the consecration of bishops, to consult the Sortes Sanctorum, tothereby learn the success and fate of the episcopate. On the other hand, we aretold that the Sortes Sanctorum were condemned by the Council of Agda, in 506. Inthis case again we are left to inquire, in which instance has the infallibilityof the Church failed? Was it when she prohibited that which was practiced by hergreatest saint and patron, Augustine, or in the twelfth century, when it wasopenly and with the sanction of the same Church practiced by the clergy for thebenefit of the bishop's elections? Or, must we still believe that in both ofthese contradictory cases the Vatican was inspired by the direct \"spirit ofGod\"? If any doubt that Gregory of Tours approved of a practice that prevails to thisday, more or less, even among strict Protestants, let them read this:\"Lendastus, Earl of Tours, who was for ruining me with Queen Fredegonde, comingto Tours, big with evil designs against me, I withdrew to my oratory under adeep concern, where I took the Psalms, . . . My heart revived within me when Icast my eyes on this of the seventy-seventh Psalm: 'He caused them to go on withconfidence, whilst the sea swallowed up their enemies.' Accordingly, the countspoke not a word to my prejudice; and leaving Tours that very day, the boat inwhich he was, sunk in a storm, but his skill in swimming saved him.\" The sainted bishop simply confesses here to having practiced a bit of sorcery.Every mesmerizer knows the power of will during an intense desire bent on anyparticular subject. Whether in consequence of \"co-incidents\" or otherwise, theopened verse suggested to his mind revenge by drowning. Passing the remainder ofthe day in \"deep concern,\" and possessed by this all-absorbing thought, thesaint--it may be unconsciously--exercises his will on the subject; and thuswhile imagining in the accident the hand of God, he simply becomes a sorcererexercising his magnetic will which reacts on the person feared; and the countbarely escapes with his life. Were the accident decreed by God, the culpritwould have been drowned; for a simple bath could not have altered his malevolentresolution against St. Gregory had he been very intent on it. Furthermore, we find anathemas fulminated against this lottery of fate, at thecouncil of Varres, which forbids \"all ecclesiastics, under pain ofexcommunication, to perform that kind of divination, or to pry into futurity, bylooking into any book, or writing, whatsoever.\" The same prohibition ispronounced at the councils of Agda in 506, of Orleans, in 511, of Auxerre in595, and finally at the council of Aenham in 1110; the latter condemning\"sorcerers, witches, diviners, such as occasioned death by magical operations,and who practiced fortune-telling by the holy-book lots\"; and the complaint ofthe joint clergy against de Garlande, their bishop at Orleans, and addressed toPope Alexander III., concludes in this manner: \"Let your apostolical hands puton strength to strip naked the iniquity of this man, that the curseprognosticated on the day of his consecration may overtake him; for the gospelsbeing opened on the altar according to custom, the first words were: and theyoung man, leaving his linen cloth, fled from them naked.\" * Why then roast the lay-magicians and consulters of books, and canonize theecclesiastics? Simply because the mediaeval as well as the modern phenomena,manifested through laymen, whether produced through occult knowledge orhappening independently, upset the claims of both the Catholic and ProtestantChurches to divine miracles. In the face of reiterated and unimpeachableevidence it became impossible for the former to maintain successfully theassertion that seemingly miraculous manifestations by the \"good angels\" andGod's direct intervention could be produced exclusively by her chosen ministersand holy saints. Neither could the Protestant well maintain on the same groundthat miracles had ended with the apostolic ages. For, whether of the same natureor not, the modern phenomena claimed close kinship with the biblical ones. Themagnetists and healers of our century came into direct and open competition withthe apostles. The Zouave Jacob, of France, had outrivalled the prophet Elijah inrecalling to life persons who were seemingly dead; and Alexis, the somnambulist,mentioned by Mr. Wallace in his work, **was, by his lucidity, putting to shameapostles, prophets, and the Sibyls of old. Since the burning of the last witch,the great Revolution of France, so elaborately prepared by the league of thesecret societies and their clever emissaries, had blown over Europe and awakenedterror in the bosom of the clergy. It had, like a destroying hurricane, sweptaway in its course those best allies of the Church, the Roman Catholicaristocracy. A sure foundation was now laid for the right of individual opinion.The world was freed from ecclesiastical tyranny by opening an unobstructed pathto Napoleon the Great, who had given the deathblow to the Inquisition. Thisgreat slaughter-house of the Christian Church--wherein she butchered, in thename of the Lamb, all the sheep arbitrarily declared scurvy--was in ruins, andshe found herself left to her own responsibility and resources. So long as the phenomena had appeared only sporadically, she had always feltherself powerful enough to repress the consequences. Superstition and belief inthe Devil were as strong as ever, and Science had not yet dared to publiclymeasure her forces with those of supernatural Religion. Meanwhile the enemy hadslowly but surely gained ground. All at once it broke out with an unexpectedviolence. \"Miracles\" began to appear in full daylight, and passed from theirmystic seclusion into the domain of natural law, where the profane hand ofScience was ready to strip off their sacerdotal mask. Still, for a time, theChurch held her position, and with the powerful help of superstitious fearchecked the progress of the intruding force. But, when in succession appearedmesmerists and somnambulists, reproducing the physical and mental phenomenon ofecstasy, hitherto believed to be the special gift of saints; when the passionfor the turning tables had reached in France and elsewhere its climax of fury;when the psychography--alleged spiritual--from a simple curiosity had developeditself and settled into an unabated interest, and finally ebbed into religiousmysticism; when the echoes aroused by the first raps of Rochester, crossing theoceans, spread until they were re-percussed from nearly every corner of theworld--then, and only then, the Latin Church was fully awakened to a sense ofdanger. Wonder after wonder was reported to have occurred in the spiritualcircles and the lecture-rooms of the mesmerists; the sick were healed, the blindmade to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear. J. R. Newton in America, and DuPotet in France, were healing the multitude without the slightest claim todivine intervention. The great discovery of Mesmer, which reveals to the earnestinquirer the mechanism of nature, mastered, as if by magical power, organic andinorganic bodies. But this was not the worst. A more direful calamity for the Church occurred inthe evocation from the upper and nether worlds of a multitude of \"spirits,\"whose private bearing and conversation gave the direct lie to the most cherishedand profitable dogmas of the Church. These \"spirits\" claimed to be the identicalentities, in a disembodied state, of fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters,friends and acquaintances of the persons viewing the weird phenomena. The Devilseemed to have no objective existence, and this struck at the very foundationupon which the chair of St. Peter rested. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu100.htm#fn_31] Not a spirit except themocking mannikins of Planchette would confess to the most distant relationshipwith the Satanic majesty, or accredit him with the governorship of a single inchof territory. The clergy felt their prestige growing weaker every day, as theysaw the people impatiently shaking off, in the broad daylight of truth, the darkveils with which they had been blindfolded for so many centuries. Then finally,fortune, which previously had been on their side in the long-waged conflictbetween theology and science, deserted to their adversary. The help of thelatter to the study of the occult side of nature was truly precious and timely,and science has unwittingly widened the once narrow path of the phenomena into abroad highway. Had not this conflict culminated at the nick of time, we mighthave seen reproduced on a miniature scale the disgraceful scenes of the episodesof Salem witchcraft and the Nuns of Loudun. As it was, the clergy were muzzled. But if Science has unintentionally helped the progress of the occult phenomena,the latter have reciprocally aided science herself. Until the days whennewly-reincarnated philosophy boldly claimed its place in the world, there hadbeen but few scholars who had undertaken the difficult task of studyingcomparative theology. This science occupies a domain heretofore penetrated byfew explorers. The necessity which it involved of being well acquainted with thedead languages, necessarily limited the number of students. Besides, there wasless popular need for it so long as people could not replace the Christianorthodoxy by something more tangible. It is one of the most undeniable facts ofpsychology, that the average man can as little exist out of a religious elementof some kind, as a fish out of the water. The voice of truth, \"a voice strongerthan the voice of the mightiest thunder,\" speaks to the inner man in thenineteenth century of the Christian era, as it spoke in the correspondingcentury B.C. It is a useless and unprofitable task to offer to humanity thechoice between a future life and annihilation. The only chance that remains forthose friends of human progress who seek to establish for the good of mankind afaith, henceforth stripped entirely of superstition and dogmatic fetters is toaddress them in the words of Joshua: \"Choose ye this day whom you will serve;whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of theflood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell.\" * \"The science of religion,\" wrote Max Muller in 1860, \"is only just beginning. .. . During the last fifty years the authentic documents of the most importantreligions in the world have been recovered in a most unexpected and almostmiraculous manner. ** We have now before us the Canonical books of Buddhism; theZend-Avesta of Zoroaster is no longer a sealed book; and the hymns of theRig-Veda have revealed a state of religions anterior to the first beginnings ofthat mythology which in Homer and Hesiod stands before us as a moulderingruin.\" *** In their insatiable desire to extend the dominion of blind faith, the earlyarchitects of Christian theology had been forced to conceal, as much as it waspossible, the true sources of the same. To this end they are said to have burnedor otherwise destroyed all the original manuscripts on the Kabala, magic, andoccult sciences upon which they could lay their hands. They ignorantly supposedthat the most dangerous writings of this class had perished with the lastGnostic; but some day they may discover their mistake. Other authentic and asimportant documents will perhaps reappear in a \"most unexpected and almostmiraculous manner.\" There are strange traditions current in various parts of the East--on MountAthos and in the Desert of Nitria, for instance--among certain monks, and withlearned Rabbis in Palestine, who pass their lives in commenting upon the Talmud.They say that not all the rolls and manuscripts, reported in history to havebeen burned by Caesar, by the Christian mob, in 389, and by the Arab GeneralAmru, perished as it is commonly believed; and the story they tell is thefollowing: At the time of the contest for the throne, in 51 B.C., betweenCleopatra and her brother Dionysius Ptolemy, the Bruckion, which contained overseven hundred thousand rolls, all bound in wood and fire-proof parchment, wasundergoing repairs, and a great portion of the original manuscripts, consideredamong the most precious, and which were not duplicated, were stored away in thehouse of one of the librarians. As the fire which consumed the rest was but theresult of accident, no precautions had been taken at the time. But they add,that several hours passed between the burning of the fleet, set on fire byCaesar's order, and the moment when the first buildings situated near the harborcaught fire in their turn; and that all the librarians, aided by several hundredslaves attached to the museum, succeeded in saving the most precious of therolls. So perfect and solid was the fabric of the parchment, that while in somerolls the inner pages and the wood-binding were reduced to ashes, of others theparchment binding remained unscorched. These particulars were all written out inGreek, Latin, and the Chaldeo-Syriac dialect, by a learned youth named Theodas,one of the scribes employed in the museum. One of these manuscripts is allegedto be preserved till now in a Greek convent; and the person who narrated thetradition to us had seen it himself. He said that many more will see it andlearn where to look for important documents, when a certain prophecy will befulfilled; adding, that most of these works could be found in Tartary andIndia. * The monk showed us a copy of the original, which, of course, we couldread but poorly, as we claim but little erudition in the matter of deadlanguages. But we were so particularly struck by the the vivid and picturesquetranslation of the holy father, that we perfectly remember some curiousparagraphs, which run, as far as we can recall them, as follows:--\"When theQueen of the Sun (Cleopatra) was brought back to the half-ruined city, after thefire had devoured the Glory of the World; and when she saw the mountains ofbooks--or rolls--covering the half-consumed steps of the estrada; and when sheperceived that the inside was gone and the indestructible covers alone remained,she wept in rage and fury, and cursed the meanness of her fathers who hadgrudged the cost of the real Pergamos for the inside as well as the outside ofthe precious rolls.\" Further, our author, Theodas, indulges in a joke at theexpense of the queen for believing that nearly all the library was burned; when,in fact, hundreds and thousands of the choicest books were safely stored in hisown house and those of other scribes, librarians, students, and philosophers. No more do sundry very learned Copts scattered all over the East in Asia Minor,Egypt, and Palestine believe in the total destruction of the subsequentlibraries. For instance, they say that out of the library of Attalus III. ofPergamus, presented by Antony to Cleopatra, not a volume was destroyed. At thattime, according to their assertions, from the moment that the Christians beganto gain power in Alexandria--about the end of the fourth century--and Anatolius,Bishop of Laodicea, began to insult the national gods, the Pagan philosophersand learned theurgists adopted effective measures to preserve the repositoriesof their sacred learning. Theophilus, a bishop, who left behind him thereputation of a most rascally and mercenary villain, was accused by one namedAntoninus, a famous theurgist and eminent scholar of occult science ofAlexandria, with bribing the slaves of the Serapion to steal books which he soldto foreigners at great prices. History tells us how Theophilus had the best ofthe philosophers, in A.D. 389; and how his successor and nephew, the no lessinfamous Cyril, butchered Hypatia. Suidas gives us some details about Antoninus,whom he calls Antonius, and his eloquent friend Olympus, the defender of theSerapion. But history is far from being complete in the miserable remnants ofbooks, which, crossing so many ages, have reached our own learned century; itfails to give the facts relating to the first five centuries of Christianitywhich are preserved in the numerous traditions current in the East.Unauthenticated as these may appear, there is unquestionably in the heap ofchaff much good grain. That these traditions are not oftener communicated toEuropeans is not strange, when we consider how apt our travellers are to renderthemselves antagonistic to the natives by their skeptical bearing and,occasionally, dogmatic intolerance. When exceptional men like somearchaeologists, who knew how to win the confidence and even friendship ofcertain Arabs, are favored with precious documents, it is declared simply a\"coincidence.\" And yet there are widespread traditions of the existence ofcertain subterranean, and immense galleries, in the neighborhood ofIshmonia--the \"petrified City,\" in which are stored numberless manuscripts androlls. For no amount of money would the Arabs go near it. At night, they say,from the crevices of the desolate ruins, sunk deep in the unwatered sands of thedesert, stream the rays from lights carried to and fro in the galleries by nohuman hands. The Afrites study the literature of the antediluvian ages,according to their belief, and the Djin learns from the magic rolls the lessonof the following day. The Encyclopedia Britannica, in its article on Alexandria, says: \"When thetemple of Serapis was demolished . . . the valuable library was pillaged ordestroyed; and twenty years afterwards *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu100.htm#fn_36] the empty shelves excitedthe regret . . . etc.\" But it does not state the subsequent fate of the pillagedbooks. In rivalry of the fierce Mary-worshippers of the fourth century, the modernclerical persecutors of liberalism and \"heresy\" would willingly shut up all theheretics and their books in some modern Serapion and burn them alive. **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu100.htm#fn_37] The cause of this hatred isnatural. Modern research has more than ever unveiled the secret. \"Is not theworship of saints and angels now,\" said Bishop Newton, years ago, \"in allrespects the same that the worship of demons was in former times? The name onlyis different, the thing is identically the same . . . the very same temples, thevery same images, which were once consecrated to Jupiter and the other demons,are now consecrated to the Virgin Mary and other saints . . . the whole ofPaganism is converted and applied to Popery.\" Why not be impartial and add that \"a good portion of it was adopted byProtestant religions also\"? The very apostolic designation Peter is from the Mysteries. The hierophant orsupreme pontiff bore the Chaldean title Peter, or interpreter. The names Phtah,Peth'r, the residence of Balaam, Patara, and Patras, the names of oracle-cities,pateres or pateras and, perhaps, Buddha, * all come from the same root. Jesussays: \"Upon this petra I will build my Church, and the gates, or rulers ofHades, shall not prevail against it\"; meaning by petra the rock-temple, and bymetaphor, the Christian Mysteries; the adversaries to which were the oldmystery-gods of the underworld, who were worshipped in the rites of Isis,Adonis, Atys, Sabazius, Dionysus, and the Eleusinia. No apostle Peter was everat Rome; but the Pope, seizing the sceptre of the Pontifex Maximus, the keys ofJanus and Kubele, and adorning his Christian head with the cap of the MagnaMater, copied from that of the tiara of Brahmatma, the Supreme Pontiff of theInitiates of old India, became the successor of the Pagan high priest, the realPeter-Roma, or Petroma. ** The Roman Catholic Church has two far mightier enemies than the \"heretics\" andthe \"infidels\"; and these are--Comparative Mythology and Philology. When sucheminent divines as the Rev. James Freeman Clarke go so much out of their way toprove to their readers that \"Critical Theology from the time of Origen andJerome . . . and the Controversial Theology during fifteen centuries, has notconsisted in accepting on authority the opinions of other people,\" but hasshown, on the contrary, much \"acute and comprehensive reasoning,\" we can butregret that so much scholarship should have been wasted in attempting to provethat which a fair survey of the history of theology upsets at every step. Inthese \"controversies\" and critical treatment of the doctrines of the Church onecan certainly find any amount of \"acute reasoning,\" but far more of a stillacuter sophistry. Recently the mass of cumulative evidence has been re-inforced to an extent whichleaves little, if any, room for further controversy. A conclusive opinion isfurnished by too many scholars to doubt the fact that India was the Alma-Mater,not only of the civilization, arts, and sciences, but also of all the greatreligions of antiquity; Judaism, and hence Christianity, included. Herder placesthe cradle of humanity in India, and shows Moses as a clever and relativelymodern compiler of the ancient Brahmanical traditions: \"The river whichencircles the country (India) is the sacred Ganges, which all Asia considers asthe paradisaical river. There, also, is the biblical Gihon, which is none elsebut the Indus. The Arabs call it so unto this day, and the names of thecountries watered by it are yet existing among the Hindus.\" Jacolliot claims tohave translated every ancient palm-leaf manuscript which he had the fortune ofbeing allowed by the Brahmans of the pagodas to see. In one of his translations,we found passages which reveal to us the undoubted origin of the keys of St.Peter, and account for the subsequent adoption of the symbol by theirHolinesses, the Popes of Rome. He shows us, on the testimony of the Agrouchada Parikshai, which he freelytranslates as \"the Book of Spirits\" (Pitris), that centuries before our era theinitiates of the temple chose a Superior Council, presided over by theBrahm-atma or supreme chief of all these Initiates. That this pontificate, whichcould be exercised only by a Brahman who had reached the age of eighty years; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu100.htm#fn_40] that the Brahm-atma wassole guardian of the mystic formula, resume of every science, contained in thethree mysterious letters, [images/00021.jpg] which signify creation, conservation, and transformation. He alone could expoundits meaning in the presence of the initiates of the third and supreme degree.Whomsoever among these initiates revealed to a profane a single one of thetruths, even the smallest of the secrets entrusted to his care, was put todeath. He who received the confidence had to share his fate. \"Finally, to crown this able system,\" says Jacolliot, \"there existed a wordstill more superior to the mysterious monosyllable--A U M, and which renderedhim who came into the possession of its key nearly the equal of Brahma himself.The Brahm-atma alone possessed this key, and transmitted it in a sealed casketto his successor. \"This unknown word, of which no human power could, even to-day, when theBrahmanical authority has been crushed under the Mongolian and Europeaninvasions, to-day, when each pagoda has its Brahm-atma ** force the disclosure,was engraved in a golden triangle and preserved in a sanctuary of the temple ofAsgartha, whose Brahm-atma alone held the keys. He also bore upon his tiara twocrossed keys supported by two kneeling Brahmans, symbol of the precious depositof which he had the keeping. . . . This word and this triangle were engravedupon the tablet of the ring that this religious chief wore as one of the signsof his dignity; it was also framed in a golden sun on the altar, where everymorning the Supreme Pontiff offered the sacrifice of the sarvameda, or sacrificeto all the forces of nature.\" *** Is this clear enough? And will the Catholics still maintain that it was theBrahmans of 4,000 years ago who copied the ritual, symbols, and dress of theRoman Pontiffs? We would not feel in the least surprised. Without going very far back into antiquity for comparisons, if we only stop atthe fourth and fifth centuries of our era, and contrast the so-called\"heathenism\" of the third Neo-platonic Eclectic School with the growingChristianity, the result may not be favorable to the latter. Even at that earlyperiod, when the new religion had hardly outlined its contradictory dogmas; whenthe champions of the bloodthirsty Cyril knew not themselves whether Mary was tobecome \"the Mother of God,\" or rank as a \"demon\" in company with Isis; when thememory of the meek and lowly Jesus still lingered lovingly in every Christianheart, and his words of mercy and charity vibrated still in the air, even thenthe Christians were outdoing the Pagans in every kind of ferocity and religiousintolerance. And if we look still farther back, and seek for examples of true Christism, inages when Buddhism had hardly superseded Brahmanism in India, and the name ofJesus was only to be pronounced three centuries later, what do we find? Which ofthe holy pillars of the Church has ever elevated himself to the level ofreligious tolerance and noble simplicity of character of some heathen? Compare,for instance, the Hindu Asoka, who lived 300 B.C., and the Carthaginian St.Augustine, who flourished three centuries after Christ. According to Max Muller,this is what is found engraved on the rocks of Girnar, Dhauli, and Kapurdigiri: \"Piyadasi, the king beloved of the gods, desires that the ascetics of all creedsmight reside in all places. All these ascetics profess alike the command whichpeople should exercise over themselves, and the purity of the soul. But peoplehave different opinions and different inclinations.\" And here is what Augustine wrote after his baptism: \"Wondrous depth of thywords! whose surface, behold! is before us, inviting to little ones; yet arethey a wondrous depth, O my God, a wondrous depth! It is awful to look therein;yes . . . an awfulness of honor, and a trembling of love. Thy enemies [readPagans] thereof I hate vehemently; Oh, that thou wouldst slay them with thytwo-edged sword, that they might no longer be enemies to it; for so do I love tohave them slain.\" * Wonderful spirit of Christianity; and that from a Manichean converted to thereligion of one who even on his cross prayed for his enemies! Who the enemies of the \"Lord\" were, according to the Christians, is notdifficult to surmise; the few inside the Augustinian fold were His new childrenand favorites, who had supplanted in His affections the sons of Israel, His\"chosen people.\" The rest of mankind were His natural foes. The teemingmultitudes of heathendom were proper food for the flames of hell; the handfulwithin the Church communion, \"heirs of salvation.\" But if such a proscriptive policy was just, and its enforcement was \"sweetsavor\" in the nostrils of the \"Lord,\" why not scorn also the Pagan rites andphilosophy? Why draw so deep from the wells of wisdom, dug and filled up to brimby the same heathen? Or did the fathers, in their desire to imitate the chosenpeople whose time-worn shoes they were trying to fit upon their feet,contemplate the reenaction of the spoliation-scene of the Exodus? Did theypropose, in fleeing from heathendom as the Jews did from Egypt, to carry off thevaluables of its religious allegories, as the \"chosen ones\" did the gold andsilver ornaments? It certainly does seem as if the events of the first centuries of Christianitywere but the reflection of the images thrown upon the mirror of the future atthe time of the Exodus. During the stormy days of Irenaeus the Platonicphilosophy, with its mystical submersion into Deity, was not so obnoxious afterall to the new doctrine as to prevent the Christians from helping themselves toits abstruse metaphysics in every way and manner. Allying themselves with theascetical therapeutae--forefathers and models of the Christian monks andhermits, it was in Alexandria, let it be remembered, that they laid the firstfoundations of the purely Platonic trinitarian doctrine. It became thePlato-Philonean doctrine later, and such as we find it now. Plato considered thedivine nature under a three-fold modification of the First Cause, the reason orLogos, and the soul or spirit of the universe. \"The three archial or originalprinciples,\" says Gibbon, * \"were represented in the Platonic system as threegods, united with each other by a mysterious and ineffable generation.\" Blendingthis transcendental idea with the more hypostatic figure of the Logos of Philo,whose doctrine was that of the oldest Kabala, and who viewed the King Messiah,as the metatron, or \"the angel of the Lord,\" the Legatus descended in flesh, butnot the Ancient of Days Himself; **the Christians clothed with this mythicalrepresentation of the Mediator for the fallen race of Adam, Jesus, the son ofMary. Under this unexpected garb his personality was all but lost. In the modernJesus of the Christian Church, we find the ideal of the imaginative Irenaeus,not the adept of the Essenes, the obscure reformer from Galilee. We see himunder the disfigured Plato-Philonean mask, not as the disciples heard him on themount. So far then the heathen philosophy had helped them in the building of theprincipal dogma. But when the theurgists of the third Neo-platonic school,deprived of their ancient Mysteries, strove to blend the doctrines of Plato withthose of Aristotle, and by combining the two philosophies added to theirtheosophy the primeval doctrines of the Oriental Kabala, then the Christiansfrom rivals became persecutors. Once that the metaphysical allegories of Platowere being prepared to be discussed in public in the form of Grecian dialectics,all the elaborate system of the Christian trinity would be unravelled and thedivine prestige completely upset. The eclectic school, reversing the order, hadadopted the inductive method; and this method became its death-knell. Of allthings on earth, logic and reasonable explanations were the most hateful to thenew religion of mystery; for they threatened to unveil the whole ground-work ofthe trinitarian conception; to apprise the multitude of the doctrine ofemanations, and thus destroy the unity of the whole. It could not be permitted,and it was not. History records the Christ-like means that were resorted to. The universal doctrine of emanations, adopted from time immemorial by thegreatest schools which taught the kabalistic, Alexandrian, and Orientalphilosophers, gives the key to that panic among the Christian fathers. Thatspirit of Jesuitism and clerical craft, which prompted Parkhurst, many centurieslater, to suppress in his Hebrew Lexicon the true meaning of the first word ofGenesis, originated in those days of war against the expiring Neo-platonic andeclectic school. The fathers had decided to pervert the meaning of the word\"daimon,\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu100.htm#fn_46] and theydreaded above all to have the esoteric and true meaning of the word Rasitunveiled to the multitudes; for if once the true sense of this sentence, as wellas that of the Hebrew word asdt (translated in the Septuagint \"angels,\" while itmeans emanations), ** were understood rightly, the mystery of the Christiantrinity would have crumbled, carrying in its downfall the new religion into thesame heap of ruins with the ancient Mysteries. This is the true reason whydialecticians, as well as Aristotle himself, the \"prying philosopher,\" were everobnoxious to Christian theology. Even Luther, while on his work of reform,feeling the ground insecure under his feet, notwithstanding that the dogmas hadbeen reduced by him to their simplest expression, gave full vent to his fear andhatred for Aristotle. The amount of abuse he heaped upon the memory of the greatlogician can only be equalled--never surpassed--by the Pope's anathemas andinvectives against the liberals of the Italian government. Compiled together,they might easily fill a copy of a new encyclopaedia with models for monkishdiatribes. Of course the Christian clergy can never get reconciled with a doctrine based onthe application of strict logic to discursive reasoning? The number of those whohave abandoned theology on this account has never been made known. They haveasked questions and been forbidden to ask them; hence, separation, disgust, andoften a despairing plunge into the abyss of atheism. The Orphean views of etheras chief medium between God and created matter were likewise denounced. TheOrphic Æther recalled too vividly the Archeus, the Soul of the World, and thelatter was in its metaphysical sense as closely related to the emanations, beingthe first manifestation--Sephira, or Divine Light. And when could the latter bemore feared than at that critical moment? Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus, Chalcidius, Methodius, and Maimonides, on theauthority of the Targum of Jerusalem, the orthodox and greatest authority of theJews, held that the first two words in the book of Genesis--B-RASIT, meanWisdom, or the Principle. And that the idea of these words meaning \"in thebeginning\" was never shared but by the profane, who were not allowed topenetrate any deeper into the esoteric sense of the sentence. Beausobre, andafter him Godfrey Higgins, have demonstrated the fact. \"All things,\" says theKabala, \"are derived from one great Principle, and this principle is the unknownand invisible God. From Him a substantial power immediately proceeds, which isthe image of God, and the source of all subsequent emanations. This secondprinciple sends forth, by the energy (or will and force) of emanation, othernatures, which are more or less perfect, according to their different degrees ofdistance, in the scale of emanation, from the First Source of existence, andwhich constitute different worlds, or orders of being, all united to the eternalpower from which they proceed. Matter is nothing more than the most remoteeffect of the emanative energy of the Deity. The material world receives itsform from the immediate agency of powers far beneath the First Source of Being *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu100.htm#fn_48] . . . Beausobref ** makesSt. Augustine the Manichean say thus: 'And if by Rasit we understand the activePrinciple of the creation, instead of its beginning, in such a case we willclearly perceive that Moses never meant to say that heaven and earth were thefirst works of God. He only said that God created heaven and earth through thePrinciple, who is His Son. It is not the time he points to, but to the immediateauthor of the creation.' Angels, according to Augustine, were created before thefirmament, and according to the esoteric interpretation, the heaven and earthwere created after that, evolving from the second Principle or the Logos--thecreative Deity. \"The word principle,\" says Beausobre, \"does not mean that theheaven and earth were created before anything else, for, to begin with, theangels were created before that; but that God did everything through His Wisdom,which is His Verbum, and which the Christian Bible named the Beginning,\" thusadopting the exoteric meaning of the word abandoned to the multitudes. TheKabala--the Oriental as well as the Jewish--shows that a number of emanations(the Jewish Sephiroth) issued from the First Principle, the chief of which wasWisdom. This Wisdom is the Logos of Philo, and Michael, the chief of the GnosticEons; it is the Ormazd of the Persians; Minerva, goddess of wisdom, of theGreeks, who emanated from the head of Jupiter; and the second Person of theChristian Trinity. The early Fathers of the Church had not much to exert theirimagination; they found a ready-made doctrine that had existed in every theogonyfor thousands of years before the Christian era. Their trinity is but the trioof Sephiroth, the first three kabalistic lights of which Moses Nachmanides says,that \"they have never been seen by any one; there is not any defect in them, norany disunion.\" The first eternal number is the Father, or the Chaldean primeval,invisible, and incomprehensible chaos, out of which proceeded the Intelligibleone. The Egyptian Phtah, or \"the Principle of Light--not the light itself, andthe Principle of Life, though himself no life.\" The Wisdom by which the Fathercreated the heavens is the Son, or the kabalistic androgynous Adam Kadmon. TheSon is at once the male Ra, or Light of Wisdom, Prudence or Intelligence,Sephira, the female part of Himself; while from this dual being proceeds thethird emanation, the Binah or Reason, the second Intelligence--the Holy Ghost ofthe Christians. Therefore, strictly speaking, there is a TETRAKTIS orquaternary, consisting of the Unintelligible First monad, and its tripleemanation, which properly constitute our Trinity. How then avoid perceiving at once, that had not the Christians purposelydisfigured in their interpretation and translation the Mosaic Genesis to fittheir own views, their religion, with its present dogmas, would have beenimpossible? The word Rasit, once taught in its new sense of the Principle andnot the Beginning, and the anathematized doctrine of emanations accepted, theposition of the second trinitarian personage becomes untenable. For, if theangels are the first divine emanations from the Divine Substance, and were inexistence before the Second Principle, then the anthropomorphized Son is at bestan emanation like themselves, and cannot be God hypostatically any more than ourvisible works are ourselves. That these metaphysical subtleties never enteredinto the head of the honest-minded, sincere Paul, is evident; as it isfurthermore evident, that like all learned Jews he was well acquainted with thedoctrine of emanations and never thought of corrupting it. How can any oneimagine that Paul identified the Son with the Father, when he tells us that Godmade Jesus \"a little lower than the angels\" (Hebrews ii. 9), and a little higherthan Moses! \"For this MAN was counted worthy of more glory than Moses\" (Hebrewsiii. 3). Of whatever, or how many forgeries, interlined later in the Acts, theFathers are guilty we know not; but that Paul never considered Christ more thana man \"full of the Spirit of God\" is but too evident: \"In the arche was theLogos, and the Logos was adnate to the Theos.\" Wisdom, the first emanation of En-Soph; the Protogonos, the Hypostasis; the AdamKadmon of the kabalist, the Brahma of the Hindu; the Logos of Plato, and the\"Beginning\" of St. John--is the Rasit-- [images/00022.jpg], of the Book ofGenesis. If rightly interpreted it overturns, as we have remarked, the wholeelaborate system of Christian theology, for it proves that behind the creativeDeity, there was a HIGHER god; a planner, an architect; and that the former wasbut His executive agent--a simple POWER! They persecuted the Gnostics, murdered the philosophers, and burned thekabalists and the masons; and when the day of the great reckoning arrives, andthe light shines in darkness, what will they have to offer in the place of thedeparted, expired religion? What will they answer, these pretended monotheists,these worshippers and pseudo-servants of the one living God, to their Creator?How will they account for this long persecution of them who were the truefollowers of the grand Megalistor, the supreme great master of the Rosicrucians,the FIRST of masons. \"For he is the Builder and Architect of the Temple of theuniverse; He is the Verbum Sapienti.\" * \"Every one knows,\" wrote the great Manichean of the third century, Fauste, \"thatthe Evangeliums were written neither by Jesus Christ, nor his apostles, but longafter their time by some unknown persons, who, judging well that they wouldhardly be believed when telling of things they had not seen themselves, headedtheir narratives with the names of the apostles or of disciples contemporaneouswith the latter.\" Commenting upon the subject, A. Franck, the learned Hebrew scholar of theInstitute and translator of the Kabala, expresses the same idea. \"Are we notauthorized,\" he asks, \"to view the Kabala as a precious remnant of religiousphilosophy of the Orient, which, transported into Alexandria, got mixed to thedoctrine of Plato, and under the usurped name of Dionysius the Areopagite,bishop of Athens, converted and consecrated by St. Paul, was thus enabled topenetrate into the mysticism of the mediaeval ages?\" * Says Jacolliot: \"What is then this religious philosophy of the Orient, which haspenetrated into the mystic symbolism of Christianity? We answer: Thisphilosophy, the traces of which we find among the Magians, the Chaldeans, theEgyptians, the Hebrew kabalists and the Christians, is none other than that ofthe Hindu Brahmans, the sectarians of the pitris, or the spirits of theinvisible worlds which surround us.\" ** But if the Gnostics were destroyed, the Gnosis, based on the secret science ofsciences, still lives. It is the earth which helps the woman, and which isdestined to open her mouth to swallow up mediaeval Christianity, the usurper andassassin of the great master's doctrine. The ancient Kabala, the Gnosis, ortraditional secret knowledge, was never without its representatives in any ageor country. The trinities of initiates, whether passed into history or concealedunder the impenetrable veil of mystery, are preserved and impressed throughoutthe ages. They are known as Moses, Aholiab, and Bezaleel, the son of Uri, theson of Hur, as Plato, Philo, and Pythagoras, etc. At the Transfiguration we seethem as Jesus, Moses, and Elias, the three Trismegisti; and three kabalists,Peter, James, and John--whose revelation is the key to all wisdom. We found themin the twilight of Jewish history as Zoroaster, Abraham, and Terah, and later asHenoch, Ezekiel, and Daniel. Who, of those who ever studied the ancient philosophies, who understandintuitionally the grandeur of their conceptions, the boundless sublimity oftheir views of the Unknown Deity, can hesitate for a moment to give thepreference to their doctrines over the incomprehensible dogmatic andcontradictory theology of the hundreds of Christian sects? Who that ever readPlato and fathomed his Το Ον, \"whom no person has seen except the Son,\" candoubt that Jesus was a disciple of the same secret doctrine which had instructedthe great philosopher? For, as we have shown before now, Plato never claimed tobe the inventor of all that he wrote, but gave credit for it to Pythagoras, who,in his turn, pointed to the remote East as the source whence he derived hisinformation and his philosophy. Colebrooke shows that Plato confesses it in hisepistles, and says that he has taken his teachings from ancient and sacreddoctrines! * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu100.htm#fn_53] Moreover, itis undeniable that the theologies of all the great nations dovetail together andshow that each is a part of \"one stupendous whole.\" Like the rest of theinitiates we see Plato taking great pains to conceal the true meaning of hisallegories. Every time the subject touches the greater secrets of the OrientalKabala, secret of the true cosmogony of the universe and of the ideal,preexisting world, Plato shrouds his philosophy in the profoundest darkness. HisTimaeus is so confused that no one but an initiate can understand the secretmeaning. And Mosheim thinks that Philo has filled his works with passagesdirectly contradicting each other for the sole purpose of concealing the truedoctrine. For once we see a critic on the right track. And this very trinitarian idea, as well as the so bitterly denounced doctrine ofemanations, whence their remotest origin? The answer is easy, and every proof isnow at hand. In the sublime and profoundest of all philosophies, that of theuniversal \"Wisdom-Religion,\" the first traces of which, historical research nowfinds in the old pre-Vedic religion of India. As the much-abused Jacolliot wellremarks, \"It is not in the religious works of antiquity, such as the Vedas, theZend Avesta, the Bible, that we have to search for the exact expression of theennobling and sublime beliefs of those epochs.\" ** \"The holy primitive syllable, composed of the three letters A ---- U ---- M., inwhich is contained the Vedic Trimurti (Trinity), must be kept secret, likeanother triple Veda,\" says Manu, in book xi., sloka 265. Swayambhouva is the unrevealed Deity; it is the Being existent through and ofitself; he is the central and immortal germ of all that exists in the universe.Three trinities emanate and are confounded in him, forming a Supreme unity.These trinities, or the triple Trimurti, are: the Nara, Nari, and Viradyi--theinitial triad; the Agni, Vaya, and Sourya--the manifested triad; Brahma, Vishnu,and Siva, the creative triad. Each of these triads becomes less metaphysical andmore adapted to the vulgar intelligence as it descends. Thus the last becomesbut the symbol in its concrete expression; the necessarianism of a purelymetaphysical conception. Together with Swayambhouva, they are the ten Sephirothof the Hebrew kabalists, the ten Hindu Prajapatis--the En-Soph of the former,answering to the great Unknown, expressed by the mystic A U M of the latter. Says Franck, the translator of the Kabala: \"The ten Sephiroth are divided into three classes, each of them presenting to usthe divinity under a different aspect, the whole still remaining an indivisibleTrinity. \"The first three Sephiroth are purely intellectual in metaphysics, they expressthe absolute identity of existence and thought, and form what the modernkabalists called the intelligible world--which is the first manifestation ofGod. \"The three that follow, make us conceive God in one of their aspects, as theidentity of goodness and wisdom; in the other they show to us, in the Supremegood, the origin of beauty and magnificence (in the creation). Therefore, theyare named the virtues, or the sensible world. \"Finally, we learn, by the last three Sephiroth, that the Universal Providence,that the Supreme artist is also absolute Force, the all-powerful cause, andthat, at the same time, this cause is the generative element of all that is. Itis these last Sephiroth that constitute the natural world, or nature in itsessence and in its active principle. Natura naturans.\" * This kabalistic conception is thus proved identical with that of the Hinduphilosophy. Whoever reads Plato and his Dialogue Timaeus, will find these ideasas faithfully re-echoed by the Greek philosopher. Moreover, the injunction ofsecrecy was as strict with the kabalists, as with the initiates of the Adyta andthe Hindu Yogis. \"Close thy mouth, lest thou shouldst speak of this (the mystery), and thy heart,lest thou shouldst think aloud; and if thy heart has escaped thee, bring it backto its place, for such is the object of our alliance\" (Sepher Jezireh, Book ofCreation). \"This is a secret which gives death: close thy mouth lest thou shouldst revealto the vulgar; compress thy brain lest something should escape from it and falloutside\" (Agrouchada-Parikshai). Truly the fate of many a future generation hung on a gossamer thread, in thedays of the third and fourth centuries. Had not the Emperor sent in 389 toAlexandria a rescript--which was forced from him by the Christians--for thedestruction of every idol, our own century would never have had a Christianmythological Pantheon of its own. Never did the Neo-platonic school reach such aheight of philosophy as when nearest its end. Uniting the mystic theosophy ofold Egypt with the refined philosophy of the Greeks; nearer to the ancientMysteries of Thebes and Memphis than they had been for centuries; versed in thescience of soothsaying and divination, as in the art of the Therapeutists;friendly with the acutest men of the Jewish nation, who were deeply imbued withthe Zoroastrian ideas, the Neo-platonists tended to amalgamate the old wisdom ofthe Oriental Kabala with the more refined conceptions of the OccidentalTheosophists. Notwithstanding the treason of the Christians, who saw fit, forpolitical reasons, after the days of Constantine, to repudiate their tutors, theinfluence of the new Platonic philosophy is conspicuous in the subsequentadoption of dogmas, the origin of which can be traced but too easily to thatremarkable school. Though mutilated and disfigured, they still preserve a strongfamily likeness, which nothing can obliterate. But, if the knowledge of the occult powers of nature opens the spiritual sightof man, enlarges his intellectual faculties, and leads him unerringly to aprofounder veneration for the Creator, on the other hand ignorance, dogmaticnarrow-mindedness, and a childish fear of looking to the bottom of things,invariably leads to fetish-worship and superstition. When Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria, had openly embraced the cause of Isis, theEgyptian goddess, and had anthropomorphized her into Mary, the mother of God;and the trinitarian controversy had taken place; from that moment the Egyptiandoctrine of the emanation of the creative God out of Emepht began to be torturedin a thousand ways, until the Councils had agreed upon the adoption of it as itnow stands--the disfigured Ternary of the kabalistic Solomon and Philo! But asits origin was yet too evident, the Word was no longer called the \"Heavenlyman,\" the primal Adam Kadmon, but became the Logos--Christ, and was made as oldas the \"Ancient of the Ancient,\" his father. The concealed WISDOM becameidentical with its emanation, the DIVINE THOUGHT, and made to be regardedcoequal and coeternal with its first manifestation. If we now stop to consider another of the fundamental dogmas of Christianity,the doctrine of atonement, we may trace it as easily back to heathendom. Thiscorner-stone of a Church which had believed herself built on a firm rock forlong centuries, is now excavated by science and proved to come from theGnostics. Professor Draper shows it as hardly known in the days of Tertullian,and as having \"originated among the Gnostic heretics.\" * We will not permitourselves to contradict such a learned authority, farther than to state that itoriginated among them no more than their \"anointed\" Christos and Sophia. Theformer they modelled on the original of the \"King Messiah,\" the male principleof wisdom, and the latter on the third Sephiroth, from the Chaldean Kabala, *and even from the Hindu Brahma and Sara-asvati, ** and the Pagan Dionysus andDemeter. And here we are on firm ground, if it were only because it is nowproved that the New Testament never appeared in its complete form, such as wefind it now, till 300 years after the period of apostles, *** and the Sohar andother kabalistic books are found to belong to the first century before our era,if not to be far older still. The Gnostics entertained many of the Essenean ideas; and the Essenes had their\"greater\" and \"minor\" Mysteries at least two centuries before our era. They werethe Isarim or Initiates, the descendants of the Egyptian hierophants, in whosecountry they had been settled for several centuries before they were convertedto Buddhistic monasticism by the missionaries of King Asoka, and amalgamatedlater with the earliest Christians; and they existed, probably, before the oldEgyptian temples were desecrated and ruined in the incessant invasions ofPersians, Greeks, and other conquering hordes. The hierophants had theiratonement enacted in the Mystery of Initiation ages before the Gnostics, or eventhe Essenes, had appeared. It was known among hierophants as the BAPTISM OFBLOOD, and was considered not as an atonement for the \"fall of man\" in Eden, butsimply as an expiation for the past, present, and future sins of ignorant butnevertheless polluted mankind. The hierophant had the option of either offeringhis pure and sinless life as a sacrifice for his race to the gods whom he hopedto rejoin, or an animal victim. The former depended entirely on their own will.At the last moment of the solemn \"new birth,\" the initiator passed \"the word\" tothe initiated, and immediately after that the latter had a weapon placed in hisright hand, and was ordered to strike. **** This is the true origin of theChristian dogma of atonement. Verily the \"Christs\" of the pre-Christian ages were many. But they died unknownto the world, and disappeared as silently and as mysteriously from the sight ofman as Moses from the top of Pisgah, the mountain of Nebo (oracular wisdom),after he had laid his hands upon Joshua, who thus became \"full of the spirit ofwisdom\" (i.e., initiated). Nor does the Mystery of the Eucharist pertain to Christians alone. GodfreyHiggins proves that it was instituted many hundreds of years before the \"PaschalSupper,\" and says that \"the sacrifice of bread and wine was common to manyancient nations.\" * Cicero mentions it in his works, and wonders at thestrangeness of the rite. There had been an esoteric meaning attached to it fromthe first establishment of the Mysteries, and the Eucharistia is one of theoldest rites of antiquity. With the hierophants it had nearly the samesignificance as with the Christians. Ceres was bread, and Bacchus was wine; theformer meaning regeneration of life from the seed, and the latter--thegrape--the emblem of wisdom and knowledge; the accumulation of the spirit ofthings, and the fermentation and subsequent strength of that esoteric knowledgebeing justly symbolized by wine. The mystery related to the drama of Eden; it issaid to have been first taught by Janus, who was also the first to introduce inthe temples the sacrifices of \"bread\" and \"wine\" in commemoration of the \"fallinto generation\" as the symbol of the \"seed.\" \"I am the vine, and my Father isthe husbandman,\" says Jesus, alluding to the secret knowledge that could beimparted by him. \"I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that daythat I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\" The festival of the Eleusinian Mysteries began in the month of Boedromion, whichcorresponds with the month of September, the time of grape-gathering, and lastedfrom the 15th to the 22d of the month, seven days. ** The Hebrew festival of theFeast of Tabernacles began on the 15th and ended on the 22d of the month ofEthanim, which Dunlap shows as derived from Adonim, Adonia, Attenim,Ethanim; *** and this feast is named in Exodus (xxiii. 16) the feast ofingatherings. \"All the men of Israel assembled unto King Solomon at the feast inthe month Ethanim, which is the seventh.\" **** Plutarch thinks the feast of the booths to be the Bacchic rites, not the theEleusinian. Thus \"Bacchus was directly called upon,\" he says. The Sabazianworship was Sabbatic; the names Evius, or Hevius, and Luaios are identical withHivite and Levite. The French name Louis is the Hebrew Levi; Iacchus again isIao or Jehovah; and Baal or Adon, like Bacchus, was a phallic god. \"Who shallascend into the hill (the high place) of the Lord?\" asks the holy king David,\"who shall stand in the place of his Kadushu [images/00023.jpg]\"? (Psalms xxiv.3). Kadesh may mean in one sense to devote, hallow, sanctify, and even toinitiate or to set apart; but it also means the ministers of lascivious rites(the Venus-worship) and the true interpretation of the word Kadesh is bluntlyrendered in Deuteronomy xxiii. 17; Hosea iv. 14; and Genesis xxxviii., fromverses 15 to 22. The \"holy\" Kadeshuth of the Bible were identical as to theduties of their office with the Nautch-girls of the later Hindu pagodas. TheHebrew Kadeshim or galli lived \"by the house of the Lord, where the women wovehangings for the grove,\" or bust of Venus-Astarte, says verse the seventh in thetwenty-third chapter of 2 Kings. The dance performed by David round the ark was the \"circle-dance\" said to havebeen prescribed by the Amazons for the Mysteries. Such was the dance of thedaughters of Shiloh (Judges xxi. 21, 23 et passim), and the leaping of theprophets of Baal (I Kings xviii. 26). It was simply a characteristic of theSabean worship, for it denoted the motion of the planets round the sun. That thedance was a Bacchic frenzy is apparent. Sistra were used on the occasion, andthe taunt of Michael and the king's reply are very expressive. \"The king ofIsrael uncovered himself before his maid-servants as one of the vain (ordebauched) fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself.\" And he retorts: \"I will play(act wantonly) before [images/00024.jpg], and I will be yet more vile than this,and I will be base in my own sight.\" When we remember that David had sojournedamong the Tyrians and Philistines, where their rites were common; and thatindeed he had conquered that land away from the house of Saul, by the aid ofmercenaries from their country, the countenancing and even, perhaps, theintroduction of such a Pagan-like worship by the weak \"psalmist\" seems verynatural. David knew nothing of Moses, it seems, and if he introduced theJehovah-worship it was not in its monotheistic character, but simply as that ofone of the many gods of the neighboring nations--a tutelary deity to whom he hadgiven the preference, and chosen among \"all other gods.\" Following the Christian dogmas seriatim, if we concentrate our attention uponone which provoked the fiercest battles until its recognition, that of theTrinity, what do we find? We meet it, as we have shown, northeast of the Indus;and tracing it to Asia Minor and Europe, recognize it among every people who hadanything like an established religion. It was taught in the oldest Chaldean, Egyptian, and Mithraitic schools. TheChaldean Sun-god, Mithra, was called \"Triple,\" and the trinitarian idea of theChaldeans was a doctrine of the Akkadians, who, themselves, belonged to a racewhich was the first to conceive a metaphysical trinity. The Chaldeans are atribe of the Akkadians, according to Rawlinson, who lived in Babylonia from theearliest times. They were Turanians, according to others, and instructed theBabylonians into the first notions of religion. But these same Akkadians, whowere they? Those scientists who would ascribe to them a Turanian origin, make ofthem the inventors of the cuneiform characters; others call them Sumerians;others again, respectively, make their language, of which (for very goodreasons) no traces whatever remain--Kasdean, Chaldaic, Proto-Chaldean,Kasdo-Scythic, and so on. The only tradition worthy of credence is that theseAkkadians instructed the Babylonians in the Mysteries, and taught them thesacerdotal or Mystery-language. These Akkadians were then simply a tribe of theHindu-Brahmans, now called Aryans--their vernacular language, the Sanscrit * ofthe Vedas; and the sacred or Mystery-language, that which, even in our own age,is used by the Hindu fakirs and initiated Brahmans in their magicalevocations. ** It has been, from time immemorial, and still is employed by theinitiates of all countries, and the Thibetan lamas claim that it is in thistongue that appear the mysterious characters on the leaves and bark of thesacred Koumboum. Jacolliot, who took such pains to penetrate the mysteries of the Brahmanicalinitiation in translating and commenting upon the Agrouchada-Parikshai,confesses the following: \"It is pretended also, without our being able to verify the assertion, that themagical evocations were pronounced in a particular language, and that it wasforbidden, under pain of death, to translate them into vulgar dialects. The rareexpressions that we have been able to catch like--L'rhom, h'hom, sh'hrum,sho'rhim, are in fact most curious, and do not seem to belong to any knownidiom.\" *** Those who have seen a fakir or a lama reciting his mantras and conjurations,know that he never pronounces the words audibly when preparing for a phenomenon.His lips move, and none will ever hear the terrible formula pronounced, exceptin the interior of the temples, and then in a cautious whisper. This, then, wasthe language now respectively baptized by every scientist, and, according to hisimaginative and philological propensities, Kasdeo-Semitic, Scythic,Proto-Chaldean, and the like. Scarcely two of even the most learned Sanscrit philologists are agreed as to thetrue interpretation of Vedic words. Let one put forth an essay, a lecture, atreatise, a translation, a dictionary, and straightway all the others fall toquarrelling with each other and with him as to his sins of omission andcommission. Professor Whitney, greatest of American Orientalists, says thatProfessor Muller's notes on the Rig Veda Sanhita \"are far from showing thatsound and thoughtful judgment, that moderation and economy which are among themost precious qualities of an exegete.\" Professor Muller angrily retorts uponhis critics that \"not only is the joy embittered which is the inherent reward ofall bona fide work, but selfishness, malignity, aye, even untruthfulness, gainthe upper hand, and the healthy growth of science is stunted.\" He differs \"inmany cases from the explanations of Vedic words given by Professor Roth\" in hisSanscrit Dictionary, and Professor Whitney shampooes both their heads by sayingthat there are, unquestionably, words and phrases \"as to which both alike willhereafter be set right.\" In volume i. of his Chips, Professor Muller stigmatizes all the Vedas except theRik, the Atharva-Veda included, as \"theological twaddle,\" while ProfessorWhitney regards the latter as \"the most comprehensive and valuable of the fourcollections, next after the Rik.\" To return to the case of Jacolliot. ProfessorWhitney brands him as a \"bungler and a humbug,\" and, as we remarked above, thisis the very general verdict. But when the Bible dans l'Inde appeared, theSociete Academique de Saint Quentin requested M. Textor de Ravisi, a learnedIndianist, ten years Governor of Karikal, India, to report upon its merits. Hewas an ardent Catholic, and bitterly opposed Jacolliot's conclusions where theydiscredited the Mosaic and Catholic revelations; but he was forced to say:\"Written with good faith, in an easy, vigorous, and passionate style, of an easyand varied argumentation, the work of M. Jacolliot is of absorbing interest . .. a learned work on known facts and with familiar arguments.\" Enough. Let Jacolliot have the benefit of the doubt when such very imposingauthorities are doing their best to show up each other as incompetents andliterary journeymen. We quite agree with Professor Whitney that \"the truism,that [for European critics?] it is far easier to pull to pieces than to buildup, is nowhere truer than in matters affecting the archeology and history ofIndia.\" * Babylonia happened to be situated on the way of the great stream of the earliestHindu emigration, and the Babylonians were one of the first peoples benefitedthereby. ** These Khaldi were the worshippers of the Moon-god, Deus Lunus, fromwhich fact we may infer that the Akkadians--if such must be their name--belongedto the race of the Kings of the Moon, whom tradition shows as having reigned inPruyay--now Allahabad. With them the trinity of Deus Lunus was manifested in thethree lunar phases, completing the quaternary with the fourth, and typifying thedeath of the Moon-god in its gradual waning and final disappearance. This deathwas allegorized by them, and attributed to the triumph of the genius of evilover the light-giving deity; as the later nations allegorized the death of theirSun-gods, Osiris and Apollo, at the hands of Typhon and the great Dragon Python,when the sun entered the winter solstice. Babel, Arach, and Akkad are names ofthe sun. The Zoroastrian Oracles are full and explicit upon the subject of theDivine Triad. \"A triad of Deity shines forth throughout the whole world, ofwhich a Monad is the head,\" admits the Reverend Dr. Maurice. \"For from this Triad, in the bosoms, are all things governed,\" says a Chaldeanoracle. The Phos, Pur, and Phlox, of Sanchoniathon, ***are Light, Fire, andFlame, three manifestations of the Sun who is one. Bel-Saturn, Jupiter-Bel, andBel or Baal-Chom are the Chaldean trinity; **** \"The Babylonian Bel was regardedin the Triume aspect of Belitan, Zeus-Belus (the mediator) and Baal-Chom who isApollo Chomaeus. This was the Triune aspect of the 'Highest God,' who is,according to Berosus, either El (the Hebrew), Bel, Belitan, Mithra, or Zervana,and has the name Πατερ, \"the Father.\" *****The Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, ******corresponding to Power, Wisdom, and Justice, which answer in their turn toSpirit, Matter, Time, and the Past, Present, and Future, can be found in thetemple of Gharipuri; thousands of dogmatic Brahmans worship these attributes ofthe Vedic Deity, while the severe monks and nuns of Buddhistic Thibet recognizebut the sacred trinity of the three cardinal virtues: Poverty, Chastity, andObedience, professed by the Christians, practiced by the Buddhists and someHindus alone. The Persian triplicate Deity also consists of three persons, Ormazd, Mithra, andAhriman. \"That is that principle,\" says Porphyry, * \"which the author of theChaldaic Summary saith, 'They conceive there is one principle of all things, anddeclare that is one and good.' \" The Chinese idol Sanpao, consists of threeequal in all respects; ** and the Peruvians \"supposed their Tanga-tanga to beone in three, and three in one,\" says Faben. ***The Egyptians have their Emepht,Eicton, and Phta; and the triple god seated on the Lotos can be seen in the St.Petersburg Museum, on a medal of the Northern Tartars. Among the Church dogmas which have most seriously suffered of late at the handsof the Orientalists, the last in question stands conspicuous. The reputation ofeach of the three personages of the anthropomorphic godhead as an originalrevelation to the Christians through Divine will, has been badly compromised byinquiry into its predecessors and origin. Orientalists have published more aboutthe similarity between Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Christianity than was strictlyagreeable to the Vatican. Draper's assertion that \"Paganism was modified byChristianity, Christianity by Paganism,\" **** is being daily verified. \"Olympuswas restored but the divinities passed under other names,\" he says, treating ofthe Constantine period. \"The more powerful provinces insisted on the adoption oftheir time-honored conceptions. Views of the trinity in accordance with theEgyptian traditions were established. Not only was the adoration of Isis under anew name restored, but even her image, standing on the crescent moon,reappeared. The well-known effigy of that goddess with the infant Horus in herarms has descended to our days, in the beautiful artistic creations of theMadonna and child.\" But a still earlier origin than the Egyptian and Chaldean can be assigned to theVirgin \"Mother of God,\" Queen of Heaven. Though Isis is also by right the Queenof Heaven, and is generally represented carrying in her hand the Crux Ansatacomposed of the mundane cross, and of the Stauros of the Gnostics, she is agreat deal younger than the celestial virgin, Neith. In one of the tombs of thePharaohs--Rhameses, in the valley of Biban-el-Molouk, in Thebes, Champollion,Junior, discovered a picture, according to his opinion the most ancient ever yetfound. It represents the heavens symbolized by the figure of a woman bedeckedwith stars. The birth of the Sun is figured by the form of a little child,issuing from the bosom of its \"Divine Mother.\" In the Book of Hermes, \"Pimander\" is enunciated in distinct and unequivocalsentences, the whole trinitarian dogma accepted by the Christians. \"The light isme,\" says Pimander, the DIVINE THOUGHT. \"I am the nous or intelligence, and I amthy god, and I am far older than the human principle which escapes from theshadow. I am the germ of thought, the resplendent WORD, the SON of GOD. Thinkthat what thus sees and hears in thee, is the Verbum of the Master, it is theThought, which is God the Father. . . . The celestial ocean, the ÆTHER, whichflows from east to west, is the Breath of the Father, the life-giving Principle,the HOLY GHOST!\" \"For they are not at all separated and their union is LIFE.\" Ancient as may be the origin of Hermes, lost in the unknown days of Egyptiancolonization, there is yet a far older prophecy, directly relating to the HinduChristna, according to the Brahmans. It is, to say the least, strange that theChristians claim to base their religion upon a prophecy of the Bible, whichexists nowhere in that book. In what chapter or verse does Jehovah, the \"LordGod,\" promise Adam and Eve to send them a Redeemer who will save humanity? \"Iwill put enmity between thee and the woman,\" says the Lord God to the serpent,\"and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shaltbruise his heel.\" In these words there is not the slightest allusion to a Redeemer, and thesubtilest of intellects could not extract from them, as they stand in the thirdchapter of Genesis, anything like that which the Christians have contrived tofind. On the other hand, in the traditions and Manu, Brahma promises directly tothe first couple to send them a Saviour who will teach them the way tosalvation. \"It is from the lips of a messenger of Brahma, who will be born in Kuroukshetra,Matsya, and the land of Pantchola, also called Kanya-Cubja (mountain of theVirgin), that all men on earth will learn their duty,\" says Manu (book ii.,slokas 19 and 20). The Mexicans call the Father of their Trinity Yzona, the Son Bacab, and the HolyGhost Echvah, \"and say they received it (the doctrine) from their ancestors.\" *Among the Semitic nations we can trace the trinity to the prehistorical days ofthe fabled Sesostris, who is identified by more than one critic with Nimrod,\"the mighty hunter.\" Manetho makes the oracle rebuke the king, when the latterasks, \"Tell me, O thou strong in fire, who before me could subjugate all things?and who shall after me?\" And the oracle saith thus: \"First God, then the Word,and then 'the Spirit.' \" ** In the foregoing lies the foundation of the fierce hatred of the Christianstoward the \"Pagans\" and the theurgists. Too much had been borrowed; the ancientreligions and the Neo-platonists had been laid by them under contributionsufficiently to perplex the world for several thousand years. Had not theancient creeds been speedily obliterated, it would have been found impossible topreach the Christian religion as a New Dispensation, or the direct Revelationfrom God the Father, through God the Son, and under the influence of God theHoly Ghost. As a political exigence the Fathers had--to gratify the wishes oftheir rich converts--instituted even the festivals of Pan. They went so far asto accept the ceremonies hitherto celebrated by the Pagan world in honor of theGod of the gardens, in all their primitive sincerity. *** It was time to severthe connection. Either the Pagan worship and the Neo-platonic theurgy, with allceremonial of magic, must be crushed out forever, or the Christians becomeNeo-platonists. The fierce polemics and single-handed battles between Irenaeus and the Gnosticsare too well known to need repetition. They were carried on for over twocenturies after the unscrupulous Bishop of Lyons had uttered his last religiousparadox. Celsus, the Neo-platonist, and a disciple of the school of AmmoniusSaccas, had thrown the Christians into perturbation, and even had arrested for atime the progress of proselytism by successfully proving that the original andpurer forms of the most important dogmas of Christianity were to be found onlyin the teachings of Plato. Celsus accused them of accepting the worstsuperstitions of Paganism, and of interpolating passages from the books of theSybils, without rightly understanding their meaning. The accusations were soplausible, and the facts so patent, that for a long time no Christian writer hadventured to answer the challenge. Origen, at the fervent request of his friend,Ambrosius, was the first to take the defense in hand, for, having belonged tothe same Platonic school of Ammonius, he was considered the most competent manto refute the well-founded charges. But his eloquence failed, and the onlyremedy that could be found was to destroy the writings of Celsus themselves. *This could be achieved only in the fifth century, when copies had been takenfrom this work, and many were those who had read and studied them. If no copy ofit has descended to our present generation of scientists, it is not becausethere is none extant at present, but for the simple reason that the monks of acertain Oriental church on Mount Athos will neither show nor confess they haveone in their possession. ** Perhaps they do not even know themselves the valueof the contents of their manuscripts, on account of their great ignorance. The dispersion of the Eclectic school had become the fondest hope of theChristians. It had been looked for and contemplated with intense anxiety. It wasfinally achieved. The members were scattered by the hand of the monstersTheophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, and his nephew Cyril--the murderer of theyoung, the learned, and the innocent Hypatia! * With the death of the martyred daughter of Theon, the mathematician, thereremained no possibility for the Neo-platonists to continue their school atAlexandria. During the life-time of the youthful Hypatia her friendship andinfluence with Orestes, the governor of the city, had assured the philosopherssecurity and protection against their murderous enemies. With her death they hadlost their strongest friend. How much she was revered by all who knew her forher erudition, noble virtues, and character, we can infer from the lettersaddressed to her by Synesius, Bishop of Ptolemais, fragments of which havereached us. \"My heart yearns for the presence of your divine spirit,\" he wrotein 413 A.D., \"which more than anything else could alleviate the bitterness of myfortunes.\" At another time he says: \"Oh, my mother, my sister, my teacher, mybenefactor! My soul is very sad. The recollection of my children I have lost iskilling me. . . . When I have news of you and learn, as I hope, that you aremore fortunate than myself, I am at least only half-unhappy.\" What would have been the feelings of this most noble and worthy of Christianbishops, who had surrendered family and children and happiness for the faithinto which he had been attracted, had a prophetic vision disclosed to him thatthe only friend that had been left to him, his \"mother, sister, benefactor,\"would soon become an unrecognizable mass of flesh and blood, pounded to jellyunder the blows of the club of Peter the Reader--that her youthful, innocentbody would be cut to pieces, \"the flesh scraped from the bones,\" byoyster-shells and the rest of her cast into the fire, by order of the sameBishop Cyril he knew so well--Cyril, the CANONIZED Saint!! ** There has never been a religion in the annals of the world with such a bloodyrecord as Christianity. All the rest, including the traditional fierce fights ofthe \"chosen people\" with their next of kin, the idolatrous tribes of Israel,pale before the murderous fanaticism of the alleged followers of Christ! Eventhe rapid spread of Mahometanism before the conquering sword of the Islamprophet, is a direct consequence of the bloody riots and fights amongChristians. It was the intestine war between the Nestorians and Cyrilians thatengendered Islamism; and it is in the convent of Bozrah that the prolific seedwas first sown by Bahira, the Nestorian monk. Freely watered by rivers of blood,the tree of Mecca has grown till we find it in the present century overshadowingnearly two hundred millions of people. The recent Bulgarian atrocities are butthe natural outgrowth of the triumph of Cyril and the Mariolaters. The cruel, crafty politician, the plotting monk, glorified by ecclesiasticalhistory with the aureole of a martyred saint. The despoiled philosophers, theNeo-platonists, and the Gnostics, daily anathematized by the Church all over theworld for long and dreary centuries. The curse of the unconcerned Deity hourlyinvoked on the magian rites and theurgic practice, and the Christian clergythemselves using sorcery for ages. Hypatia, the glorious maiden-philosopher,torn to pieces by the Christian mob. And such as Catherine de Medicis, LucreziaBorgia, Joanna of Naples, and the Isabellas of Spain, presented to the world asthe faithful daughters of the Church--some even decorated by the Pope with theorder of the \"Immaculate Rose,\" the highest emblem of womanly purity and virtue,a symbol sacred to the Virgin-mother of God! Such are the examples of humanjustice! How far less blasphemous appears a total rejection of Mary as animmaculate goddess, than an idolatrous worship of her, accompanied by suchpractices. In the next chapter we will present a few illustrations of sorcery, as practicedunder the patronage of the Roman Church.

Hisonly and much-beloved nephew, whom, having no children, he had adopted as a son,was in the Russian army. The elderly couple had a portrait of his--a water-colorpainting--constantly, during the meals, placed on the table in front of theyoung man's usual seat. One evening as the family, with some friends, were attheir early tea, the glass over the portrait, without any one touching it, wasshattered to atoms with a loud explosion. As the aunt of the young soldiercaught the picture in her hand she saw the forehead and head besmeared withblood. The guests, in order to quiet her, attributed the blood to her having cuther fingers with the broken glass. But, examine as they would, they could notfind the vestige of a cut on her fingers, and no one had touched the picture butherself. Alarmed at her state of excitement the husband, pretending to examinethe portrait more closely, cut his finger on purpose, and then tried to assureher that it was his blood and that, in the first excitement, he had touched theframe without any one remarking it. All was in vain, the old lady felt sure thatDimitry was killed. She began to have masses said for him daily at the villagechurch, and arrayed the whole household in deep mourning. Several weeks later,an official communication was received from the colonel of the regiment, statingthat their nephew was killed by a fragment of a shell which had carried off theupper part of his head. 18:*Executions for witchcraft took place, not much later than a century ago, inother of the American provinces.

It is not a hundred years since they have been enforced to themurderous letter of their text. 20:*Vide the title-page on the English translation of Mayerhoff's \"Reuchlin undSeine Zeit,\" Berlin, 1830. \"The Life and Times of John Reuchlin, or Capnion, theFather of the German Reformation,\" by F.

The clergy,frightened at the uninterrupted evidence furnished by scientific research, atlast decided to confront the enemy, and we find the \"Chronique des Arts\" givingthe cleverest, and at the same time most Jesuitical, explanation of the fact.According to their story, \"The increase in the number of the faithful decidedPeter upon making Rome henceforth the centre of his action. The cemetery ofOstrianum was too distant and would not suffice for the reunions of theChristians. The motive which had induced the Apostle to confer on Linus andCletus successively the episcopal character, in order to render them capable ofsharing the solicitudes of a church whose extent was to be without limits, lednaturally to a multiplication of the places of meeting. The particular residenceof Peter was therefore fixed at Viminal; and there was established thatmysterious Chair, the symbol of power and truth. The august seat which wasvenerated at the Ostrian Catacombs was not, however, removed. Peter stillvisited this cradle of the Roman Church, and often, without doubt, exercised hisholy functions there. A second Chair, expressing the same mystery as the first,was set up at Cornelia, and it is this which has come down to us through theages.\" Now, so far from it being possible that there ever were two genuine chairs ofthis kind, the majority of critics show that Peter never was at Rome at all; thereasons are many and unanswerable. Perhaps we had best begin by pointing to theworks of Justin Martyr. This great champion of Christianity, writing in theearly part of the second century in Rome, where he fixed his abode, eager to gethold of the least proof in favor of the truth for which he suffered, seemsperfectly unconscious of St. Peter's existence!! Neither does any other writer of any consequence mention him in connection withthe Church of Rome, earlier than the days of Irenaeus, when the latter sethimself to invent a new religion, drawn from the depths of his imagination. Werefer the reader anxious to learn more to the able work of Mr. George Reber,entitled \"The Christ of Paul.\" The arguments of this author are conclusive. Theabove article in the \"Chronique des Arts,\" speaks of the increase of thefaithful to such an extent that Ostrianum could not contain the number ofChristians. Now, if Peter was at Rome at all--runs Mr. Reber's argument--it musthave been between the years A.D. 64 and 69; for at 64 he was at Babylon, fromwhence he wrote epistles and letters to Rome, and at some time between 64 and 68(the reign of Nero) he either died a martyr or in his bed, for Irenaeus makeshim deliver the Church of Rome, together with Paul (! ?) (whom he persecuted andquarrelled with all his life), into the hands of Linus, who became bishop in 69(see Reber's \"Christ of Paul,\" p. 122). We will treat of it more fully inchapter iii. Now, we ask, in the name of common sense, how could the faithful of Peter'sChurch increase at such a rate, when Nero trapped and killed them like so manymice during his reign? History shows the few Christians fleeing from Rome,wherever they could, to avoid the persecution of the emperor, and the \"Chroniquedes Arts\" makes them increase and multiply! \"Christ,\" the article goes on tosay, \"willed that this visible sign of the doctrinal authority of his vicarshould also have its portion of immortality; one can follow it from age to agein the documents of the Roman Church.\" Tertullian formally attests its existencein his book \"De Praescriptionibus.\" Eager to learn everything concerning sointeresting a subject, we would like to be shown when did Christ WILL anythingof the kind? However: \"Ornaments of ivory have been fitted to the front and backof the chair, but only on those parts repaired with acacia-wood. Those whichcover the panel in front are divided into three superimposed rows, eachcontaining six plaques of ivory, on which are engraved various subjects, amongothers the 'Labors of Hercules.' Several of the plaques were wrongly placed, andseemed to have been affixed to the chair at a time when the remains of antiquitywere employed as ornaments, without much regard to fitness.\" This is the point.The article was written simply as a clever answer to several facts publishedduring the present century. Bower, in his \"History of the Popes\" (vol. ii., p.7), narrates that in the year 1662, while cleaning one of the chairs, \"the'Twelve Labors of Hercules' unluckily appeared engraved upon it,\" after whichthe chair was removed and another substituted. But in 1795, when Bonaparte'stroops occupied Rome, the chair was again examined. This time there was foundthe Mahometan confession of faith, in Arabic letters: \"There is no Deity butAllah, and Mahomet is his Apostle.\" (See appendix to \"Ancient Symbol-Worship,\"by H. M. Westropp and C. Staniland Wake.) In the appendix Prof. Alexander Wildervery justly remarks as follows: \"We presume that the Apostle of theCircumcision, as Paul, his great rival, styles him, was never at the ImperialCity, nor had a successor there, not even in the ghetto. The 'Chair of Peter,'therefore, is sacred rather than apostolical. Its sanctity proceeded, however,from the esoteric religion of the former times of Rome. The hierophant of theMysteries probably occupied it on the day of initiations, when exhibiting to thecandidates the Petroma (stone tablet containing the last revelation made by thehierophant to the neophyte for initiation).\" 26:*Joshua xxiv., 15. 26:** One of the most surprising facts that have come under our observation, isthat students of profound research should not couple the frequent recurrence ofthese \"unexpected and almost miraculous\" discoveries of important documents, atthe most opportune moments, with a premeditated design. Is it so strange thatthe custodians of \"Pagan\" lore, seeing that the proper moment had arrived,should cause the needed document, book, or relic to fall as if by accident inthe right man's way? Geological surveyors and explorers even as competent asHumboldt and Tschuddi, have not discovered the hidden mines from which thePeruvian Incas dug their treasure, although the latter confesses that thepresent degenerate Indians have the secret. In 1839, Perring, the archaeologist,proposed to the sheik of an Arab village two purses of gold, if he helped him todiscover the entrance to the hidden passage leading to the sepulchral chambersin the North Pyramid of Doshoor. But though his men were out of employment andhalf-starved, the sheik proudly refused to \"sell the secret of the dead,\"promising to show it gratis, when the time would come for it. Is it, then,impossible that in some other regions of the earth are guarded the remains ofthat glorious literature of the past, which was the fruit of its majesticcivilization? What is there so surprising in the idea? Who knows but that as theChristian Church has unconsciously begotten free thought by reaction against herown cruelty, rapacity, and dogmatism, the public mind may be glad to follow thelead of the Orientalists, away from Jerusalem and towards Ellora; and that thenmuch more will be discovered that is now hidden? 26:***\"Chips from a German Workshop,\" vol. i., p. 373; Semitic Monotheism. 27:* An after-thought has made us fancy that we can understand what is meant bythe following sentences of Moses of Chorene: \"The ancient Asiatics,\" says he,\"five centuries before our era--and especially the Hindus, the Persians, and theChaldeans, had in their possession a quantity of historical and scientificbooks. These works were partially borrowed, partially translated in the Greeklanguage, mostly since the Ptolemies had established the Alexandrian library andencouraged the writers by their liberalities, so that the Greek language becamethe deposit of all the sciences\" (\"History of Armenia\"). Therefore, the greaterpart of the literature included in the 700,000 volumes of the AlexandrianLibrary was due to India, and her next neighbors. 29:* Bonamy says in \"La Bibliotheque d'Alexandrie,\" quoting, we suppose, thePresbyter Orosius, who was an eye-witness, \"thirty years later.\" 29:** Since the above was written, the spirit here described has beenbeautifully exemplified at Barcelona, Spain, where the Bishop Fray Joachiminvited the local spiritualists to witness a formal burning of spiritual books.We find the account in a paper called \"The Revelation,\" published at Alicante,which sensibly adds that the performance was \"a caricature of the memorableepoch of the Inquisition.\" 30:* E.

So deeply is it rooted among the popular beliefs, that wedo not imagine there is a person in Russia who has not heard of it. It is buttoo easy to trace the origin of this superstition to the old Mysteries which hadbeen for ages spread all over the globe. The ancient Variago-Rouss had hisMysteries in the North as well as in the South of Russia; and there are manyrelics of the by-gone faith scattered in the lands watered by the sacredDnieper, the baptismal Jordan of all Russia. No Znachar (the knowing one) orKoldoun (sorcerer), male or female, can die in fact before he has passed themysterious word to some one. The popular belief is that unless he does that hewill linger and suffer for weeks and months, and were he even finally to getliberated, it would be only to wander on earth, unable to quit its region unlesshe finds a successor even after death. How far the belief may be verified byothers, we do not know, but we have seen a case which, for its tragical andmysterious denoument, deserves to be given here as an illustration of thesubject in hand. An old man, of over one hundred years of age, a peasant-serf inthe government of S----, having a wide reputation as a sorcerer and healer, wassaid to be dying for several days, and still unable to die. The report spreadlike lightning, and the poor old fellow was shunned by even the members of hisown family, as the latter were afraid of receiving the unwelcome inheritance. Atlast the public rumor in the village was that he had sent a message to acolleague less versed than himself in the art, and who, although he lived in adistant district, was nevertheless coming at the call, and would be on handearly on the following morning. There was at that time on a visit to theproprietor of the village a young physician who, belonging to the famous schoolof Nihilism of that day, laughed outrageously at the idea. The master of thehouse, being a very pious man, and but half inclined to make so cheap of the\"superstition,\" smiled--as the saying goes--but with one corner of his mouth.Meanwhile the young skeptic, to gratify his curiosity, had made a visit to thedying man, had found that he could not live twenty-four hours longer, and,determined to prove the absurdity of the \"superstition,\" had taken means todetain the coming \"successor\" at a neighboring village. Early in the morning a company of four persons, comprising the physician, themaster of the place, his daughter, and the writer of the present lines, went tothe hut in which was to be achieved the triumph of skepticism. The dying man wasexpecting his liberator every moment, and his agony at the delay became extreme.We tried to persuade the physician to humor the patient, were it for humanity'ssake. He only laughed. Getting hold with one hand of the old wizard's pulse, hetook out his watch with the other, and remarking in French that all would beover in a few moments, remained absorbed in his professional experiment. Thescene was solemn and appalling. Suddenly the door opened, and a young boyentered with the intelligence, addressed to the doctor, that the koum was lyingdead drunk at a neighboring village, and, according to his orders, could not bewith \"grandfather\" till the next day. The young doctor felt confused, and wasjust going to address the old man, when, as quick as lightning, the Znacharsnatched his hand from his grasp and raised himself in bed. His deep-sunken eyesflashed; his yellow-white beard and hair streaming round his livid face made hima dreadful sight. One instant more, and his long, sinewy arms were clasped roundthe physician's neck, as with a supernatural force he drew the doctor's headcloser and closer to his own face, where he held him as in a vise, whilewhispering words inaudible to us in his ear. The skeptic struggled to freehimself, but before he had time to make one effective motion the work hadevidently been done; the hands relaxed their grasp, and the old sorcerer fell onhis back--a corpse! A strange and ghostly smile had settled on the stony lips--asmile of fiendish triumph and satisfied revenge; but the doctor looked paler andmore ghastly than the dead man himself. He stared round with an expression ofterror difficult to describe, and without answering our inquiries rushed outwildly from the hut, in the direction of the woods. Messengers were sent afterhim, but he was nowhere to be found. About sunset a report was heard in theforest. An hour later his body was brought home, with a bullet through his head,for the skeptic had blown out his brains! What made him commit suicide? What magic spell of sorcery had the \"word\" of thedying wizard left on his mind? Who can tell? 44:*\"Anacalypsis\"; also Tertullian. 44:**\"Anthon,\" art.

Having injured his leg in a fall from the steamer into the boat inwhich he was to land at the Mount, he was taken care of by these monks, andduring his convalescence, through gifts of money and presents, became theirgreatest friend, and finally won their entire confidence. Having asked for theloan of some books, he was taken by the Superior to a large cellar in which theykeep their sacred vessels and other property. Opening a great trunk, full of oldmusty manuscripts and rolls, he was invited by the Superior to \"amuse himself.\"The gentleman was a scholar, and well versed in Greek and Latin text. \"I wasamazed,\" he says, in a private letter, \"and had my breath taken away, on findingamong these old parchments, so unceremoniously treated, some of the mostvaluable relics of the first centuries, hitherto believed to have been lost.\"Among others he found a half-destroyed manuscript, which he is perfectly suremust be a copy of the \"True Doctrine,\" the Αογος αλε τηες of Celsus, out ofwhich Origen quoted whole pages. The traveller took as many notes as he could onthat day, but when he came to offer to the Superior to purchase some of thesewritings he found, to his great surprise, that no amount of money would temptthe monks. They did not know what the manuscripts contained, nor \"did theycare,\" they said. But the \"heap of writing,\" they added, was transmitted to themfrom one generation to another, and there was a tradition among them that thesepapers would one day become the means of crushing the \"Great Beast of theApocalypse,\" their hereditary enemy, the Church of Rome. They were constantlyquarrelling and fighting with the Catholic monks, and among the whole \"heap\"they knew that there was a \"holy\" relic which protected them. They did not knowwhich, and so in their doubt abstained. It appears that the Superior, a shrewdGreek, understood his bevue and repented of his kindness, for first of all hemade the traveller give him his most sacred word of honor, strengthened by anoath he made him take on the image of the Holy Patroness of the Island, never tobetray their secret, and never mention, at least, the name of their convent. Andfinally, when the anxious student who had passed a fortnight in reading allsorts of antiquated trash before he happened to stumble over some preciousmanuscript, expressed the desire to have the key, to \"amuse himself\" with thewritings once more, he was very naively informed that the \"key had been lost,\"and that they did not know where to look for it. And thus he was left to the fewnotes he had taken. 53:* See the historical romance of Canon Kingsley, \"Hypatia,\" for a highlypicturesque account of the tragical fate of this young martyr. 53:** We beg the reader to bear in mind that it is the same Cyril who wasaccused and proved guilty of having sold the gold and silver ornaments of hischurch, and spent the money. He pleaded guilty, but tried to excuse himself onthe ground that he had used the money for the poor, but could not give evidenceof it. His duplicity with Arius and his party is well known. Thus one of thefirst Christian saints, and the founder of the Trinity, appears on the pages ofhistory as a murderer and a thief!

The author was a learned publicist, who, during twentyyears of his life, collected authentic documents from the archives of nearlyevery important city of France, to make up a complete work on sorcery, magic,and the power of various \"demons.\" To use an expression of Eliphas Levi, hisbook offers a most remarkable collection of \"bloody and hideous facts; acts ofrevolting superstition, arrests, and executions of stupid ferocity.\" \"Burn everybody!\" the Inquisition seemed to say--God will easily sort out His own! Poorfools, hysterical women, and idiots were roasted alive, without mercy, for thecrime of \"magic.\" But, \"at the same time, how many great culprits escaped thisunjust and sanguinary justice! This is what Bodin makes us fully appreciate.\" Catherine, the pious Christian--who has so well deserved in the eyes of theChurch of Christ for the atrocious and never-to-be-forgotten massacre of St.Bartholomew--the Queen Catherine, kept in her service an apostate Jacobinpriest. Well versed in the \"black art,\" so fully patronized by the Medicifamily, he had won the gratitude and protection of his pious mistress, by hisunparalleled skill in killing people at a distance, by torturing with variousincantations their wax simulacra. The process has been described over and overagain, and we scarcely need repeat it. Charles was lying sick of an incurable disease. The queen-mother, had everythingto lose in case of his death, resorted to necromancy, consulted the oracle ofthe \"bleeding head.\" This infernal operation required the decapitation of achild who must be possessed of great beauty and purity. He had been prepared insecret for his first communion, by the chaplain of the palace, who was apprisedof the plot, and at midnight of the appointed day, in the chamber of the sickman, and in presence only of Catherine and a few of her confederates, the\"devil's mass\" was celebrated. Let us give the rest of the story as we find itin one of Levi's works: \"At this mass, celebrated before the image of the demon,having under his feet a reversed cross, the sorcerer consecrated two wafers, oneblack and one white. The white was given to the child, whom they brought clothedas for baptism, and who was murdered upon the very steps of the altar,immediately after his communion. His head, separated from the trunk by a singleblow, was placed, all palpitating, upon the great black wafer which covered thebottom of the paten, then placed upon a table where some mysterious lamps wereburning. The exorcism then began, and the demon was charged to pronounce anoracle, and reply by the mouth of this head to a secret question that the kingdared not speak aloud, and that had been confided to no one. Then a feeblevoice, a strange voice, which had nothing of human character about it, madeitself audible in this poor little martyr's head.\" The sorcery availed nothing;the king died, and--Catherine remained the faithful daughter of Rome! How strange, that des Mousseaux, who makes such free use of Bodin's materials toconstruct his formidable indictment against Spiritualists and other sorcerers,should have overlooked this interesting episode! It is a well-attested fact that Pope Sylvester II. was publicly accused byCardinal Benno with being a sorcerer and an enchanter. The brazen \"oracularhead\" made by his Holiness was of the same kind as the one fabricated byAlbertus Magnus. The latter was smashed to pieces by Thomas Aquinas, not becauseit was the work of or inhabited by a \"demon,\" but because the spook who wasfixed inside, by mesmeric power, talked incessantly, and his verbiage preventedthe eloquent saint from working out his mathematical problems. These heads andother talking statues, trophies of the magical skill of monks and bishops, werefac-similes of the \"animated\" gods of the ancient temples. The accusationagainst the Pope was proved at the time. It was also demonstrated that he wasconstantly attended by \"demons\" or spirits. In the preceding chapter we havementioned Benedict IX., John XX., and the VIth and VIIth Gregory, who were allknown as magicians. The latter Pope, moreover, was the famous Hildebrand, whowas said to have been so expert at \"shaking lightning out of his sleeve.\" Anexpression which makes the venerable spiritualistic writer, Mr. Howitt, thinkthat \"it was the origin of the celebrated thunder of the Vatican.\" The magical achievements of the Bishop of Ratisbon and those of the \"angelicdoctor,\" Thomas Aquinas, are too well known to need repetition; but we mayexplain farther how the \"illusions\" of the former were produced. If the Catholicbishop was so clever in making people believe on a bitter winter night that theywere enjoying the delights of a splendid summer day, and cause the icicleshanging from the boughs of the trees in the garden to seem like so many tropicalfruits, the Hindu magicians also practice such biological powers unto this veryday, and claim the assistance of neither god nor devil. Such \"miracles\" are allproduced by the same human power that is inherent in every man, if he only knewhow to develop it. About the time of the Reformation, the study of alchemy and magic had become soprevalent among the clergy as to produce great scandal. Cardinal Wolsey wasopenly accused before the court and the privy-council of confederacy with a mannamed Wood, a sorcerer, who said that \"My Lord Cardinale had suche a rynge thatwhatsomevere he askyd of the Kynges grace that he hadd yt\"; adding that \"MasterCromwell, when he . . . was servaunt in my lord cardynales housse . . . redemany bokes and specyally the boke of Salamon . . . and studied mettells and whatvertues they had after the canon of Salamon.\" This case, with several othersequally curious, is to be found among the Cromwell papers in the Record Officeof the Rolls House. A priest named William Stapleton was arrested as a conjurer, during the reign ofHenry VIII., and an account of his adventures is still preserved in the RollsHouse records. The Sicilian priest whom Benvenuto Cellini calls a necromancer,became famous through his successful conjurations, and was never molested. Theremarkable adventure of Cellini with him in the Colosseum, where the priestconjured up a whole host of devils, is well known to the reading public. Thesubsequent meeting of Cellini with his mistress, as predicted and brought aboutby the conjurer, at the precise time fixed by him, is to be considered, as amatter of course, a \"curious coincidence.\" In the latter part of the sixteenthcentury there was hardly a parish to be found in which the priests did not studymagic and alchemy. The practice of exorcism to cast out devils \"in imitation ofChrist,\" who by the way never used exorcism at all, led the clergy to devotethemselves openly to \"sacred\" magic in contradistinction to black art, of whichlatter crime were accused all those who were neither priests nor monks. The occult knowledge gleaned by the Roman Church from the once fat fields oftheurgy she sedulously guarded for her own use, and sent to the stake only thosepractitioners who \"poached\" on her lands of the Scientia Scientiarum, and thosewhose sins could not be concealed by the friar's frock. The proof of it lies inthe records of history. \"In the course only of fifteen years, between 1580 to1595, and only in the single province of Lorraine, the President Remigius burned900 witches,\" says Thomas Wright, in his Sorcery and Magic. It was during thesedays, prolific in ecclesiastical murder and unrivalled for cruelty and ferocity,that Jean Bodin wrote. While the orthodox clergy called forth whole legions of \"demons\" through magicalincantations, unmolested by the authorities, provided they held fast to theestablished dogmas and taught no heresy, on the other hand, acts of unparalleledatrocity were perpetrated on poor, unfortunate fools. Gabriel Malagrida, an oldman of eighty, was burnt by these evangelical Jack Ketches in 1761. In theAmsterdam library there is a copy of the report of his famous trial, translatedfrom the Lisbon edition. He was accused of sorcery and illicit intercourse withthe Devil, who had \"disclosed to him futurity.\" (?) The prophecy imparted by theArch-Enemy to the poor visionary Jesuit is reported in the following terms: \"Theculprit hath confessed that the demon, under the form of the blessed Virgin,having commanded him to write the life of Antichrist (?), told him that he,Malagrida, was a second John, but more clear than John the Evangelist; thatthere were to be three Antichrists, and that the last should be born at Milan,of a monk and a nun, in the year 1920; that he would marry Proserpine, one ofthe infernal furies,\" etc. The prophecy is to be verified forty-three years hence. Even were all thechildren born of monks and nuns really to become antichrists if allowed to growup to maturity, the fact would seem far less deplorable than the discoveriesmade in so many convents when the foundations have been removed for some reason.If the assertion of Luther is to be disbelieved on account of his hatred forpopery, then we may name discoveries of the same character made quite recentlyin Austrian and Russian Poland. Luther speaks of a fish-pond at Rome, situatednear a convent of nuns, which, having been cleared out by order of Pope Gregory,disclosed, at the bottom, over six thousand infant skulls; and of a nunnery atNeinburg, in Austria, whose foundations, when searched, disclosed the samerelics of celibacy and chastity! \"Ecclesia non novit Sanguinem!\" meekly repeated the scarlet-robed cardinals. Andto avoid the spilling of blood which horrified them, they instituted the HolyInquisition. If, as the occultists maintain, and science half confirms, our mosttrifling acts and thoughts are indelibly impressed upon the eternal mirror ofthe astral ether, there must be somewhere, in the boundless realm of the unseenuniverse, the imprint of a curious picture. It is that of a gorgeous standardwaving in the heavenly breeze at the foot of the great \"white throne\" of theAlmighty. On its crimson damask face a cross, symbol of \"the Son of God who diedfor mankind,\" with an olive branch on one side, and a sword, stained to the hiltwith human gore, on the other. A legend selected from the Psalms emblazoned ingolden letters, reading thus: \"Exurge, Domine, et judica causam meam.\" For suchappears the standard of the Inquisition, on a photograph in our possession, froman original procured at the Escurial of Madrid. Under this Christian standard, in the brief space of fourteen years, Tomas deTorquemada, the confessor of Queen Isabella, burned over ten thousand persons,and sentenced to the torture eighty thousand more. Orobio, the well-knownwriter, who was detained so long in prison, and who hardly escaped the flames ofthe Inquisition, immortalized this institution in his works when once at libertyin Holland. He found no better argument against the Holy Church than to embracethe Judaic faith and submit even to circumcision. \"In the cathedral ofSaragossa,\" says a writer on the Inquisition, \"is the tomb of a famousinquisitor. Six pillars surround the tomb; to each is chained a Moor, aspreparatory to being burned.\" On this St. Foix ingenuously observes: \"If everthe Jack Ketch of any country should be rich enough to have a splendid tomb,this might serve as an excellent model!\" To make it complete, however, thebuilders of the tomb ought not to have omitted a bas-relief of the famous horsewhich was burnt for sorcery and witchcraft. Granger tells the story, describingit as having occurred in his time. The poor animal \"had been taught to tell thespots upon cards, and the hour of the day by the watch. Horse and owner wereboth indicted by the sacred office for dealing with the Devil, and both wereburned, with a great ceremony of auto-da-fe, at Lisbon, in 1601, as wizards!\" This immortal institution of Christianity did not remain without its Dante tosing its praise. \"Macedo, a Portuguese Jesuit,\" says the author of Demonologia,\"has discovered the origin of the Inquisition, in the terrestrial Paradise, andpresumes to allege that God was the first who began the functions of aninquisitor over Cain and the workmen of Babel!\" Nowhere, during the middle ages, were the arts of magic and sorcery morepracticed by the clergy than in Spain and Portugal. The Moors were profoundlyversed in the occult sciences, and at Toledo, Seville, and Salamanca, were, onceupon a time, the great schools of magic. The kabalists of the latter town wereskilled in all the abstruse sciences; they knew the virtues of precious stonesand other minerals, and had extracted from alchemy its most profound secrets. The authentic documents pertaining to the great trial of the Marechale d'Ancre,during the regency of Marie de Medicis, disclose that the unfortunate womanperished through the fault of the priests with whom, like a true Italian, shesurrounded herself. She was accused by the people of Paris of sorcery, becauseit had been asserted that she had used, after the ceremony of exorcism,newly-killed white cocks. Believing herself constantly bewitched, and being invery delicate health, the Marechale had the ceremony of exorcism publiclyapplied to herself in the Church of the Augustins; as to the birds, she usedthem as an application to the forehead on account of dreadful pains in the head,and had been advised to do so by Montalto, the Jew physician of the queen, andthe Italian priests. In the sixteenth century, the Cure de Barjota, of the diocese of Callahora,Spain, became the world's wonder for his magical powers. His most extraordinaryfeat consisted, it was said, in transporting himself to any distant country,witnessing political and other events, and then returning home to predict themin his own country. He had a familiar demon, who served him faithfully for longyears, says the Chronicle, but the cure turned ungrateful and cheated him.Having been apprised by his demon of a conspiracy against the Pope's life, inconsequence of an intrigue of the latter with a fair lady, the cure transportedhimself to Rome (in his double, of course) and thus saved his Holiness' life.After which he repented, confessed his sins to the gallant Pope, and gotabsolution. \"On his return he was delivered, as a matter of form, into thecustody of the inquisitors of Logrono, but was acquitted and restored to hisliberty very soon.\" Friar Pietro, a Dominican monk of the fourteenth century--the magician whopresented the famous Dr. Eugenio Torralva, a physician attached to the house ofthe admiral of Castile, with a demon named Zequiel--won his fame through thesubsequent trial of Torralva. The procedure and circumstances attendant upon theextraordinary trial are described in the original papers preserved in theArchives of the Inquisition. The Cardinal of Volterra, and the Cardinal of SantaCruz, both saw and communicated with Zequiel, who proved, during the whole ofTorralva's life, to be a pure, kind, elemental spirit, doing many beneficentactions, and remaining faithful to the physician to the last hour of his life.Even the Inquisition acquitted Torralva, on that account; and, although animmortality of fame was insured to him by the satire of Cervantes, neitherTorralva nor the monk Pietro are fictitious heroes, but historical personages,recorded in ecclesiastical documents of Rome and Cuenca, in which town the trialof the physician took place, January the 29th, 1530. The book of Dr. W. G. Soldan, of Stuttgart, has become as famous in Germany, asBodin's book on Demonomania in France. It is the most complete German treatiseon witchcraft of the sixteenth century. One interested to learn the secretmachinery underlying these thousands of legal murders, perpetrated by a clergywho pretended to believe in the Devil, and succeeded in making others believe inhim, will find it divulged in the above-mentioned work. * The true origin of thedaily accusations and death-sentences for sorcery are cleverly traced topersonal and political enmities, and, above all, to the hatred of the Catholicstoward the Protestants. The crafty work of the Jesuits is seen at every page ofthe bloody tragedies; and it is in Bamberg and Wurzburg, where these worthy sonsof Loyola were most powerful at that time, that the cases of witchcraft weremost numerous. On the next page we give a curious list of some victims, many ofwhom were children between the ages of seven and eight years, and Protestants.\"Of the multitudes of persons who perished at the stake in Germany during thefirst half of the seventeenth century for sorcery, the crime of many was theirattachment to the religion of Luther,\" says T. Wright, \" . . . and the pettyprinces were not unwilling to seize upon any pretense to fill their coffers . .. the persons most persecuted being those whose property was a matter ofconsideration. . . . At Bamberg, as well as at Wurzburg, the bishop was asovereign prince in his dominions. The Prince-Bishop, John George II., who ruledBamberg . . . after several unsuccessful attempts to root out Lutheranism,distinguished his reign by a series of sanguinary witch-trials, which disgracethe annals of that city. . . . We may form some notion of the proceedings of hisworthy agent, ** from the statement of the most authentic historians, thatbetween 1625 and 1630, not less than 900 trials took place in the two courts ofBamberg and Zeil; and a pamphlet published at Bamberg by authority, in 1659,states the number of persons whom Bishop John George had caused to be burned forsorcery, to have been 600.\" *** Regretting that space should prevent our giving one of the most curious lists inthe world of burned witches, we will nevertheless make a few extracts from theoriginal record as printed in Hauber's Bibliotheca Magica. One glance at thishorrible catalogue of murders in Christ's name, is sufficient to discover thatout of 162 persons burned, more than one-half of them are designated asstrangers (i.e., Protestants) in this hospitable town; and of the other half wefind thirty-four children, the oldest of whom was fourteen, the youngest aninfant child of Dr. Schutz.

Item. \"Strange\" men and women, i.e., Protestants, 28Citizens, apparently all WEALTHY people, 100Summary: Boys, girls, and little children, 34In nineteen months, 162 persons. \"There were,\" says Wright, \"little girls of from seven to ten years of age amongthe witches, and seven and twenty of them were convicted and burnt,\" at some ofthe other brande, or burnings. \"The numbers brought to trial in these terribleproceedings were so great, and they were treated with so little consideration,that it was usual not even to take the trouble of setting down their names, butthey were cited as the accused No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and so on. *The Jesuits tooktheir confessions in private.\" What room is there in a theology which exacts such holocausts as these toappease the bloody appetites of its priests for the following gentle words: \"Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such isthe kingdom of Heaven.\" \"Even so it is not the will of your Father . . . thatone of these little ones should perish.\" \"But whoso shall offend one of theselittle ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone werehanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea.\" We sincerely hope that the above words have proved no vain threat to thesechild-burners. Did this butchery in the name of their Moloch-god prevent these treasure-huntersfrom resorting to the black art themselves? Not in the least; for in no classwere such consulters of \"familiar\" spirits more numerous than among the clergyduring the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. True, there weresome Catholic priests among the victims, but though these were generally accusedof having \"been led into practices too dreadful to be described,\" it was not so.In the twenty-nine burnings above catalogued we find the names of twelve vicars,four canons, and two doctors of divinity burnt alive. But we have only to turnto such works as were published at the time to assure ourselves that each popishpriest executed was accused of \"damnable heresy,\" i.e., a tendency toreformation--a crime more heinous far than sorcery. We refer those who would learn how the Catholic clergy united duty with pleasurein the matter of exorcisms, revenge, and treasure-hunting, to volume II.,chapter i., of W. Howitt's History of the Supernatural. \"In the book calledPneumatologia Occulta et Vera, all the forms of adjuration and conjuration werelaid down,\" says this veteran writer. He then proceeds to give a longdescription of the favorite modus operandi. The Dogme et Rituel de la HauteMagie of the late Eliphas Levi, treated with so much abuse and contempt by desMousseaux, tells nothing of the weird ceremonies and practices but what waspracticed legally and with the tacit if not open consent of the Church, by thepriests of the middle ages. The exorcist-priest entered a circle at midnight; hewas clad in a new surplice, and had a consecrated band hanging from the neck,covered with sacred characters. He wore on the head a tall pointed cap, on thefront of which was written in Hebrew the holy word, Tetragrammaton--theineffable name. It was written with a new pen dipped in the blood of a whitedove. What the exorcists most yearned after, was to release miserable spiritswhich haunt spots where hidden treasures lie. The exorcist sprinkles the circlewith the blood of a black lamb and a white pigeon. The priest had to adjure theevil spirits of hell--Acheront, Magoth, Asmodei, Beelzebub, Belial, and all thedamned souls, in the mighty names of Jehovah, Adonay, Elohah, and Sabaioth,which latter was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who dwelt in the Urim andThummim. When the damned souls flung in the face of the exorcist that he was asinner, and could not get the treasure from them, the priest-sorcerer had toreply that \"all his sins were washed out in the blood of Christ, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu101.htm#fn_91] and he bid them depart ascursed ghosts and damned flies.\" When the exorcist dislodged them at last, thepoor soul was \"comforted in the name of the Saviour, and consigned to the careof good angels,\" who were less powerful, we must think, than the exorcisingCatholic worthies, \"and the rescued treasure, of course, was secured for theChurch.\" \"Certain days,\" adds Howitt, \"are laid down in the calendar of the Church asmost favorable for the practice of exorcism; and, if the devils are difficult todrive, a fume of sulphur, assafoetida, bear's gall, and rue is recommended,which, it was presumed, would outstench even devils.\" This is the Church, and this the priesthood, which, in the nineteenth century,pays 5,000 priests to teach the people of the United States the infidelity ofscience and the infallibility of the Bishop of Rome! We have already noticed the confession of an eminent prelate that theelimination of Satan from theology would be fatal to the perpetuity of theChurch. But this is only partially true. The Prince of Sin would be gone, butsin itself would survive. If the Devil were annihilated, the Articles of Faithand the Bible would remain. In short there would still be a pretended divinerevelation, and the necessity for self-assumed inspired interpreters. We must,therefore, consider the authenticity of the Bible itself. We must study itspages, and see if they, indeed, contain the commands of the Deity, or but acompendium of ancient traditions and hoary myths. We must try to interpret themfor ourselves--if possible. As to its pretended interpreters, the only possibleassimilation we can find for them in the Bible is to compare them with the mandescribed by the wise King Solomon in his Proverbs, with the perpetrator ofthese \"six things . . . yea seven . . . which doth the Lord hate,\" and which arean abomination unto Him, to wit: \"A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands thatshed innocent blood; an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that beswift in running to mischief; a false witness that speaketh lies, and he thatsoweth discord among brethren\" (Proverbs vi. 16, 17, 18, 19). Of which of these accusations are the long line of men who have left the imprintof their feet in the Vatican guiltless? \"When the demons,\" says Augustine, \"insinuate themselves in the creatures, theybegin by conforming themselves to the will of every one. . . . In order toattract men, they begin by seducing them, by simulating obedience. . . . Howcould one know, had he not been taught by the demons themselves, what they likeor what they hate; the name which attracts, or that which forces them intoobedience; all this art, in short, of magic, the whole science of themagicians?\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu101.htm#fn_92] To this impressive dissertation of the \"saint,\" we will add that no magician hasever denied that he had learned the art from \"spirits,\" whether, being a medium,they acted independently on him, or he had been initiated into the science of\"evocation\" by his fathers who knew it before himself. But who was it then thattaught the exorcist? The priest who clothes himself with an authority not onlyover the magician, but even over all these \"spirits,\" whom he calls demons anddevils as soon as he finds them obeying any one but himself? He must havelearned somewhere from some one that power which he pretends to possess. For, \".. . how could one know had he not been taught by the demons themselves . . . thename which attracts, or that which forces them into obedience?\" asks Augustine. Useless to remark that we know the answer beforehand: \"Revelation . . . divinegift . . . the Son of God; nay, God Himself, through His direct Spirit, whodescended on the apostles as the Pentecostal fire,\" and who is now alleged toovershadow every priest who sees fit to exorcise for either glory or a gift. Arewe then to believe that the recent scandal of public exorcism, performed aboutthe 14th of October, 1876, by the senior priest of the Church of the HolySpirit, at Barcelona, Spain, was also done under the direct superintendence ofthe Holy Ghost? * It will be urged that the \"bishop was not cognizant of this freak of theclergy\"; but even if he were, how could he have protested against a riteconsidered since the days of the apostles, one of the most holy prerogatives ofthe Church of Rome? So late as in 1852, only twenty-five years ago, these ritesreceived a public and solemn sanction from the Vatican, and a new Ritual ofExorcism was published in Rome, Paris, and other Catholic capitals. DesMousseaux, writing under the immediate patronage of Father Ventura, the Generalof the Theatines of Rome, even favors us with lengthy extracts from this famousritual, and explains the reason why it was enforced again. It was in consequenceof the revival of Magic under the name of Modern Spiritualism. The bull of PopeInnocent VIII. is exhumed, and translated for the benefit of des Mousseaux'sreaders. \"We have heard,\" exclaims the Sovereign Pontiff, \"that a great numberof persons of both sexes have feared not to enter into relations with thespirits of hell; and that, by their practice of sorcery . . . they strike withsterility the conjugal bed, destroy the germs of humanity in the bosom of themother, and throw spells on them, and set a barrier to the multiplication ofanimals . . . etc., etc.\"; then follow curses and anathemas against thepractice. This belief of the Sovereign Pontiffs of an enlightened Christian country is adirect inheritance by the most ignorant multitudes from the southern Hindurabble--the \"heathen.\" The diabolical arts of certain kangalins (witches) andjadugar (sorcerers) are firmly believed in by these people. The following areamong their most dreaded powers: to inspire love and hatred at will; to send adevil to take possession of a person and torture him; to expel him; to causesudden death or an incurable disease; to either strike cattle with or protectthem from epidemics; to compose philtres that will either strike with sterilityor provoke unbounded passions in men and women, etc., etc. The sight alone of aman said to be such a sorcerer excites in a Hindu profound terror. And now we will quote in this connection the truthful remark of a writer whopassed years in India in the study of the origin of such superstitions: \"Vulgarmagic in India, like a degenerated infiltration, goes hand-in-hand with the mostennobling beliefs of the sectarians of the Pitris. It was the work of the lowestclergy, and designed to hold the populace in a perpetual state of fear. It isthus that in all ages and under every latitude, side by side with philosophicalspeculations of the highest character, one always finds the religion of therabble.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu101.htm#fn_94] In India it wasthe work of the lowest clergy; in Rome, that of the highest Pontiffs. But then,have they not as authority their greatest saint, Augustine, who declares that\"whoever believes not in the evil spirits, refuses to believe in Holy Writ?\" ** Therefore, in the second half of the nineteenth century, we find the counsel forthe Sacred Congregation of Rites (exorcism of demons included), Father Venturade Raulica, writing thus, in a letter published by des Mousseaux, in 1865: \"We are in full magic! and under false names; the Spirit of lies and impudicitygoes on perpetrating his horrible deprecations. . . . The most grievous featurein this is that among the most serious persons they do not attach the importanceto the strange phenomena which they deserve, these manifestations that wewitness, and which become with every day more weird, striking, as well as mostfatal. \"I cannot sufficiently admire and praise, from this standpoint, the zeal andcourage displayed by you in your work. The facts which you have collected arecalculated to throw light and conviction into the most skeptical minds; andafter reading this remarkable work, written with so much learnedness andconsciousness, blindness is no longer possible. \"If anything could surprise us, it would be the indifference with which thesephenomena have been treated by false Science, endeavoring as she has, to turninto ridicule so grave a subject; the childish simplicity exhibited by her inthe desire to explain the facts by absurd and contradictory hypotheses. . . . *** [Signed] \"The Father Ventura de Raulica, etc., etc.\" Thus encouraged by the greatest authorities of the Church of Rome, ancient andmodern, the Chevalier argues the necessity and the efficacy of exorcism by thepriests. He tries to demonstrate--on faith, as usual --that the power of thespirits of hell is closely related to certain rites, words, and formal signs.\"In the diabolical Catholicism,\" he says, \"as well as in the divine Catholicism,potential grace is bound (liee) to certain signs.\" While the power of theCatholic priest proceeds from God, that of the Pagan priest proceeds from theDevil. The Devil, he adds, \"is forced to submission\" before the holy minister ofGod--\"he dares not LIE.\" * We beg the reader to note well the underlined sentence, as we mean to test itstruth impartially. We are prepared to adduce proofs, undeniable and undeniedeven by the Popish Church--forced, as she was, into the confession--proofs ofhundreds of cases in relation to the most solemn of her dogmas, wherein the\"spirits\" lied from beginning to end. How about certain holy relicsauthenticated by visions of the blessed Virgin, and a host of saints? We have athand a treatise by a pious Catholic, Jilbert de Nogen, on the relics of saints.With honest despair he acknowledges the \"great number of false relics, as wellas false legends,\" and severely censures the inventors of these lying miracles.\"It was on the occasion of one of our Saviour's teeth,\" writes the author ofDemonologia, \"that de Nogen took up his pen on this subject, by which the monksof St. Medard de Soissons pretended to work miracles; a pretension which heasserted to be as chimerical as that of several persons who believed theypossessed the navel, and other parts less comely, of the body of Christ.\" ** \"A monk of St. Antony,\" says Stephens, *** \"having been at Jerusalem, saw thereseveral relics, among which was a bit of the finger of the Holy Ghost, as soundand entire as it had ever been; the snout of the seraph that appeared to St.Francis; one of the nails of a cherub; one of the ribs of the Verbum caro factum(the Word made flesh); some rays of the star that appeared to the three kings ofthe East; a phial of St. Michael's sweat, that exuded when he was fightingagainst the Devil, etc. 'All which things,' observes the monkish treasurer ofrelics, 'I have brought with me home very devoutly.' \" And if the foregoing is set aside as the invention of a Protestant enemy, may wenot be allowed to refer the reader to the History of England and authenticdocuments which state the existence of a relic not less extraordinary than thebest of the others? Henry III. received from the Grand Master of the Templars aphial containing a small portion of the sacred blood of Christ which he had shedupon the cross. It was attested to be genuine by the seals of the Patriarch ofJerusalem, and others. The procession bearing the sacred phial from St. Paul'sto Westminster Abbey is described by the historian: \"Two monks received thephial, and deposited it in the Abbey . . . which made all England shine withglory, dedicating it to God and St. Edward.\" The story of the Prince Radzivil is well known. It was the undeniable deceptionof the monks and nuns surrounding him and his own confessor which made thePolish nobleman become a Lutheran. He felt at first so indignant at the \"heresy\"of the Reformation spreading in Lithuania, that he travelled all the way to Rometo pay his homage of sympathy and veneration to the Pope. The latter presentedhim with a precious box of relics. On his return home, his confessor saw theVirgin, who descended from her glorious abode for the sole purpose of blessingthese relics and authenticating them. The superior of the neighboring conventand the mother-abbess of a nunnery both saw the same vision, with areenforcement of several saints and martyrs; they prophesied and \"felt the HolyGhost\" ascending from the box of relics and overshadowing the prince. A demoniacprovided for the purpose by the clergy was exorcised in full ceremony, and uponbeing touched by the box immediately recovered, and rendered thanks on the spotto the Pope and the Holy Ghost. After the ceremony was over the guardian of thetreasury in which the relics were kept, threw himself at the feet of the prince,and confessed that on their way back from Rome he had lost the box of relics.Dreading the wrath of his master, he had procured a similar box, \"which he hadfilled with the small bones of dogs and cats\"; but seeing how the prince wasdeceived, he preferred confessing his guilt to such blasphemous tricks. Theprince said nothing, but continued for some time testing--not the relics, buthis confessor and the vision-seers. Their mock raptures made him discover sothoroughly the gross impositions of the monks and nuns that he joined theReformed Church. This is history. Bayle shows that when the Roman Church is no longer able todeny that there have been false relics, she resorts to sophistry, and repliesthat if false relics have wrought miracles it is \"because of the good intentionsof the believers, who thus obtained from God a reward of their good faith!\" Thesame Bayle shows, by numerous instances, that whenever it was proved thatseveral bodies of the same saint, or three heads of him, or three arms (as inthe case of Augustine) were said to exist in different places, and that theycould not well be all authentic, the cool and invariable answer of the Churchwas that they were all genuine; for \"God had multiplied and miraculouslyreproduced them for the greater glory of His Holy Church!\" In other words theywould have the faithful believe that the body of a deceased saint may, throughdivine miracle, acquire the physiological peculiarities of a crawfish! We fancy that it would be hard to demonstrate to satisfaction that the visionsof Catholic saints, are, in any one particular instance, better or moretrustworthy than the average visions and prophecies of our modern \"mediums.\" Thevisions of Andrew Jackson Davis--however our critics may sneer at them--are bylong odds more philosophical and more compatible with modern science than theAugustinian speculations. Whenever the visions of Swedenborg, the greatest amongthe modern seers, run astray from philosophy and scientific truth, it is whenthey most run parallel with theology. Nor are these visions any more useless toeither science or humanity than those of the great orthodox saints. In the lifeof St. Bernard it is narrated that as he was once in church, upon a Christmaseve, he prayed that the very hour in which Christ was born might be revealed tohim; and when the \"true and correct hour came, he saw the divine babe appear inhis manger.\" What a pity that the divine babe did not embrace so favorable anopportunity to fix the correct day and year of his death, and thereby reconcilethe controversies of his putative historians. The Tischendorfs, Lardners, andColensos, as well as many a Catholic divine, who have vainly squeezed the marrowout of historical records and their own brains, in the useless search, would atleast have had something for which to thank the saint. As it is, we are hopelessly left to infer that most of the beatific and divinevisions of the Golden Legend, and those to be found in the more completebiographies of the most important \"saints,\" as well as most of the visions ofour own persecuted seers and seeresses, were produced by ignorant andundeveloped \"spirits\" passionately fond of personating great historicalcharacters. We are quite ready to agree with the Chevalier des Mousseaux, andother unrelenting persecutors of magic and spiritualism in the name of theChurch, that modern spirits are often \"lying spirits\"; that they are ever onhand to humor the respective hobbies of the persons who communicate with them at\"circles\"; that they deceive them and, therefore, are not always good \"spirits.\" But, having conceded so much, we will now ask of any impartial person: is itpossible to believe at the same time that the power given to theexorcist-priest, that supreme and divine power of which he boasts, has beengiven to him by God for the purpose of deceiving people? That the prayerpronounced by him in the name of Christ, and which, forcing the demon intosubmission, makes him reveal himself, is calculated at the same time to make thedevil confess not the truth, but that only which it is the interest of thechurch to which the exorcist belongs, should pass for truth? And this is whatinvariably happens. Compare, for instance, the responses given by the demon toLuther, with those obtained from the devils by St. Dominick. The one arguesagainst the private mass, and upbraids Luther with placing the Virgin Mary andsaints before Christ, and thus dishonoring the Son of God; * while the demonsexorcised by St. Dominick, upon seeing the Virgin whom the holy father had alsoevoked to help him, roar out: \"Oh! our enemy! oh! our damner! . . . why didstthou descend from heaven to torment us? Why art thou so powerful an intercessorfor sinners! Oh! thou most certain and secure way to heaven . . . thoucommandest us and we are forced to confess that nobody is damned who onlyperseveres in thy holy worship, etc., etc.\" ** Luther's \"Saint Satan\" assureshim that while believing in the transubstantiation of Christ's body and blood hehad been worshipping merely bread and wine; and the devils of all the Catholicsaints promise eternal damnation to whomsoever disbelieves or even so much asdoubts the dogma! Before leaving the subject, let us give one or two more instances from theChronicles of the Lives of the Saints, selected from such narratives as arefully accepted by the Church. We might fill volumes with proofs of undeniableconfederacy between the exorcisers and the demons. Their very nature betraysthem. Instead of being independent, crafty entities bent on the destruction ofmen's souls and spirits, the majority of them are simply the elementals of thekabalists; creatures with no intellect of their own, but faithful mirrors of theWILL which evokes, controls, and guides them. We will not waste our time indrawing the reader's attention to doubtful or obscure thaumaturgists andexorcisers, but take as our standard one of the greatest saints of Catholicism,and select a bouquet from that same prolific conservatory of pious lies, TheGolden Legend, of James de Voragine. *** St. Dominick, the founder of the famous order of that name, is one of themightiest saints on the calendar. His order was the first that received a solemnconfirmation from the Pope, **** and he is well known in history as theassociate and counsellor of the infamous Simon de Montfort, the papal general,whom he helped to butcher the unfortunate Albigenses in and near Toulouse. Thestory goes that this saint and the Church after him, claim that he received fromthe Virgin, in propria persona, a rosary, whose virtues produced such stupendousmiracles that they throw entirely into the shade those of the apostles, and evenof Jesus himself. A man, says the biographer, an abandoned sinner, was boldenough to doubt the virtue of the Dominican rosary; and for this unparalleledblasphemy was punished on the spot by having 15,000 devils take possession ofhim. Seeing the great suffering of the tortured demoniac, St. Dominick forgotthe insult and called the devils to account. Following is the colloquy between the \"blessed exorcist\" and the demons: Question.--How did you take possession of this man, and how many are you? Answer of the Devils. --We came into him for having spoken disrespectfully ofthe rosary. We are 15,000. Question.--Why did so many as 15,000 enter him? Answer.--Because there are fifteen decades in the rosary which he derided, etc. Dominick.--Is not all true I have said of the virtues of the rosary? Devils.--Yes! Yes! (they emit flames through the nostrils of the demoniac). Knowall ye Christians that Dominick never said one word concerning the rosary thatis not most true; and know ye further, that if you do not believe him, greatcalamities will befall you. Dominick.--Who is the man in the world the Devil hates the most? Devils.--(In chorus.) Thou art the very man (here follow verbose compliments). Dominick.--Of which state of Christians are there the most damned? Devils.--In hell we have merchants, pawnbrokers, fraudulent bankers, grocers,Jews, apothecaries, etc., etc. Dominick.--Are there any priests or monks in hell? Devils.--There are a great number of priests, but no monks, with the exceptionof such as have transgressed the rule of their order. Dominick.--Have you any Dominicans? Devils.--Alas! alas! we have not one yet, but we expect a great number of themafter their devotion is a little cooled. We do not pretend to give the questions and answers literally, for they occupytwenty-three pages; but the substance is here, as may be seen by any one whocares to read the Golden Legend. The full description of the hideous bellowingsof the demons, their enforced glorification of the saint, and so on, is too longfor this chapter. Suffice it to say that as we read the numerous questionsoffered by Dominick and the answers of the demons, we become fully convincedthat they corroborate in every detail the unwarranted assertions and support theinterests of the Church. The narrative is suggestive. The legend graphicallydescribes the battle of the exorcist with the legion from the bottomless pit.The sulphurous flames which burst forth from the nose, mouth, eyes, and ears, ofthe demoniac; the sudden appearance of over a hundred angels, clad in goldenarmor; and, finally, the descent of the blessed Virgin herself, in person,bearing a golden rod, with which she administers a sound thrashing to thedemoniac, to force the devils to confess that of herself which we scarcely needrepeat. The whole catalogue of theological truths uttered by Dominick's devilswere embodied in so many articles of faith by his Holiness, the present Pope, in1870, at the last Œcumenical Council. From the foregoing it is easy to see that the only substantial differencebetween infidel \"mediums\" and orthodox saints lies in the relative usefulness ofthe demons, if demons we must call them. While the Devil faithfully supports theChristian exorcist in his orthodox (?) views, the modern spook generally leaveshis medium in the lurch. For, by lying, he acts against his or her interestsrather than otherwise, and thereby too often casts foul suspicion on thegenuineness of the mediumship. Were modern \"spirits\" devils, they wouldevidently display a little more discrimination and cunning than they do. Theywould act as the demons of the saint which, compelled by the ecclesiasticalmagician and by the power of \"the name . . . which forces them into submission,\"lie in accordance with the direct interest of the exorcist and his church. Themoral of the parallel we leave to the sagacity of the reader. \"Observe well,\" exclaims des Mousseaux, \"that there are demons which sometimeswill speak the truth.\" \"The exorcist,\" he adds, quoting the Ritual, \"mustcommand the demon to tell him whether he is detained in the body of the demoniacthrough some magic art, or by signs, or any objects which usually serve for thisevil practice. In case the exorcised person has swallowed the latter, he mustvomit them back; and if they are not in his body, the demon must indicate theproper place where they are to be found; and having found them they must beburned.\" *Thus some \"demons reveal the existence of the bewitchment, tell who isits author, and indicate the means to destroy the malefice. But beware to everresort, in such a case, to magicians, sorcerers, or mediums. You must call tohelp you but the minister of your Church!\" \"The Church believes in magic, as youwell see,\" he adds, \"since she expresses it so formally. And those whodisbelieve in magic, can they still hope to share the faith of their own Church?And who can teach them better? To whom did Christ say: 'Go ye therefore, andteach all nations . . . and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of theworld?' \" ** Are we to believe that he said this but to those who wear these black or scarletliveries of Rome? Must we then credit the story that this power was given byChrist to Simon Stylites, the saint who sanctified himself by perching on apillar (stylos) sixty feet high, for thirty-six years of his life, without everdescending from it, in order that, among other miracles stated in the GoldenLegend, he might cure a dragon of a sore eye? \"Near Simon's pillar was thedwelling of a dragon, so very venomous that the stench was spread for milesround his cave.\" This ophidian-hermit met with an accident; he got a thorn inhis eye, and, becoming blind, crept to the saint's pillar, and pressed his eyeagainst it for three days, without touching any one. Then the blessed saint,from his aerial seat, \"three feet in diameter,\" ordered earth and water to beplaced on the dragon's eye, out of which suddenly emerged a thorn (or stake), acubit in length; when the people saw the \"miracle\" they glorified the Creator.As to the grateful dragon, he arose and, \"having adored God for two hours,returned to his cave\" *--a half-converted ophidian, we must suppose. And what are we to think of that other narrative, to disbelieve in which is \"torisk one's salvation,\" as we were informed by a Pope's missionary, of the Orderof the Franciscans? When St. Francis preached a sermon in the wilderness, thebirds assembled from the four cardinal points of the world. They warbled andapplauded every sentence; they sang a holy mass in chorus; finally theydispersed to carry the glad tidings all over the universe. A grasshopper,profiting by the absence of the Holy Virgin, who generally kept company with thesaint, remained perched on the head of the \"blessed one\" for a whole week.Attacked by a ferocious wolf, the saint, who had no other weapon but the sign ofthe cross which he made upon himself, instead of running away from his rabidassailant, began arguing with the beast. Having imparted to him the benefit tobe derived from the holy religion, St. Francis never ceased talking until thewolf became as meek as a lamb, and even shed tears of repentance over his pastsins. Finally, he \"stretched his paws in the hands of the saint, followed himlike a dog through all the towns in which he preached, and became half aChristian\"! ** Wonders of zoology! a horse turned sorcerer, a wolf and a dragonturned Christians! These two anecdotes, chosen at random from among hundreds, if rivalled are notsurpassed by the wildest romances of the Pagan thaumaturgists, magicians, andspiritualists! And yet, when Pythagoras is said to have subdued animals, evenwild beasts, merely through a powerful mesmeric influence, he is pronounced byone-half of the Catholics a bare-faced impostor, and by the rest a sorcerer, whoworked magic in confederacy with the Devil. Neither the she-bear, nor the eagle,nor yet the bull that Pythagoras is said to have persuaded to give up eatingbeans, were alleged to have answered with human voices; while St. Benedict's\"black raven,\" whom he called \"brother,\" argues with him, and croaks his answerslike a born casuist. When the saint offers him one-half of a poisoned loaf, theraven grows indignant and reproaches him in Latin as though he had justgraduated at the Propaganda! If it be objected that the Golden Legend is now but half supported by theChurch; and that it is known to have been compiled by the writer from acollection of the lives of the saints, for the most part unauthenticated, we canshow that, at least in one instance, the biography is no legendary compilation,but the history of one man, by another one who was his contemporary. Jortin andGibbon demonstrated years ago, that the early fathers used to select narratives,wherewith to ornament the lives of their apocryphal saints, from Ovid, Homer,Livy, and even from the unwritten popular legends of Pagan nations. But such isnot the case in the above instances. St. Bernard lived in the twelfth century,and St. Dominick was nearly contemporaneous with the author of the GoldenLegend. De Voragine died in 1298, and Dominick, whose exorcisms and life hedescribes so minutely, instituted his order in the first quarter of thethirteenth century. Moreover, de Voragine was Vicar-General of the Dominicanshimself, in the middle of the same century, and therefore described the miracleswrought by his hero and patron but a few years after they were alleged to havehappened. He wrote them in the same convent; and while narrating these wondershe had probably fifty persons at hand who had been eye-witnesses to the saint'smode of living. What must we think, in such a case, of a biographer whoseriously describes the following: One day, as the blessed saint was occupied inhis study, the Devil began pestering him, in the shape of a flea. He frisked andjumped about the pages of his book until the harassed saint, unwilling as he wasto act unkindly, even toward a devil, felt compelled to punish him by fixing thetroublesome devil on the very sentence on which he stopped, by clasping thebook. At another time the same devil appeared under the shape of a monkey. Hegrinned so horribly that Dominick, in order to get rid of him, ordered thedevil-monkey to take the candle and hold it for him until he had done reading.The poor imp did so, and held it until it was consumed to the very end of thewick; and, notwithstanding his pitiful cries for mercy, the saint compelled himto hold it till his fingers were burned to the bones! Enough! The approbation with which this book was received by the Church, and thepeculiar sanctity attributed to it, is sufficient to show the estimation inwhich veracity was held by its patrons. We may add, in conclusion, that thefinest quintessence of Boccaccio's Decameron appears prudery itself bycomparison with the filthy realism of the Golden Legend. We cannot regard with too much astonishment the pretensions of the CatholicChurch in seeking to convert Hindus and Buddhists to Christianity. While the\"heathen\" keeps to the faith of his fathers, he has at least the one redeemingquality--that of not having apostatized for the mere pleasure of exchanging oneset of idols for another. There may be for him some novelty in his embracingProtestantism; for in that he gains the advantage, at least, of limiting hisreligious views to their simplest expression. But when a Buddhist has beenenticed into exchanging his Shoe Dagoon for the Slipper of the Vatican, or theeight hairs from the head of Gautama and Buddha's tooth, which work miracles,for the locks of a Christian saint, and a tooth of Jesus, which work far lessclever miracles, he has no cause to boast of his choice. In his address to theLiterary Society of Java, Sir T. S. Raffles is said to have narrated thefollowing characteristic anecdote: \"On visiting the great temple on the hills ofNagasaki, the English commissioner was received with marked regard and respectby the venerable patriarch of the northern provinces, a man eighty years of age,who entertained him most sumptuously. On showing him round the courts of thetemple, one of the English officers present heedlessly exclaimed, in surprise,'Jesus Christus!' The patriarch turning half round, with a placid smile, bowedsignificantly, with the expression: 'We know your Jasus Christus! Well, don'tobtrude him upon us in our temples, and we remain friends.' And so, with ahearty shake of the hands, these two opposites parted.\" * There is scarcely a report sent by the missionaries from India, Thibet, andChina, but laments the diabolical \"obscenity\" of the heathen rites, theirlamentable impudicity; all of which \"are so strongly suggestive ofdevil-worship,\" as des Mousseaux tells us. We can scarcely be assured that themorality of the Pagans would be in the least improved were they allowed a freeinquiry into the life of say the psalmist-king, the author of those sweet Psalmswhich are so rapturously repeated by Christians. The difference between Davidperforming a phallic dance before the holy ark--emblem of the femaleprinciple--and a Hindu Vishnavite bearing the same emblem on his forehead,favors the former only in the eyes of those who have studied neither the ancientfaith nor their own. When a religion which compelled David to cut off anddeliver two hundred foreskins of his enemies before he could become the king'sson-in-law (I Sam. xviii.) is accepted as a standard by Christians, they would do well not to cast into theteeth of heathen the impudicities of their faiths. Remembering the suggestiveparable of Jesus, they ought to cast the beam out of their own eye beforeplucking at the mote in their neighbor's. The sexual element is as marked inChristianity as in any one of the \"heathen religions.\" Certainly, nowhere in theVedas can be found the coarseness and downright immodesty of language, thatHebraists now discover throughout the Mosaic Bible. It would profit little were we to dwell much upon subjects which have beendisposed of in such a masterly way by an anonymous author whose work electrifiedEngland and Germany last year; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu101.htm#fn_109] while as regards theparticular topic under notice, we cannot do better than recommend the scholarlywritings of Dr. Inman. Albeit one-sided, and in many instances unjust to theancient heathen, Pagan, and Jewish religions, the facts treated in the Ancientand Pagan Christian Symbolism, are unimpeachable. Neither can we agree with someEnglish critics who charge him with an intent to destroy Christianity. If byChristianity is meant the external religious forms of worship, then he certainlyseeks to destroy it, for in his eyes, as well as in those of every trulyreligious man, who has studied ancient exoteric faiths, and their symbology,Christianity is pure heathenism, and Catholicism, with its fetish-worshipping,is far worse and more pernicious than Hinduism in its most idolatrous aspect.But while denouncing the exoteric forms and unmasking the symbols, it is not thereligion of Christ that the author attacks, but the artificial system oftheology. We will allow him to illustrate the position in his own language, andquote from his preface: \"When vampires were discovered by the acumen of any observer,\" he says, \"theywere, we are told, ignominiously killed, by a stake being driven through thebody; but experience showed them to have such tenacity of life that they rose,again and again, notwithstanding renewed impalement, and were not ultimatelylaid to rest till wholly burned. In like manner, the regenerated heathendom,which dominates over the followers of Jesus of Nazareth, has risen again andagain, after being transfixed. Still cherished by the many, it is denounced bythe few. Amongst other accusers, I raise my voice against the Paganism whichexists so extensively in ecclesiastical Christianity, and will do my utmost toexpose the imposture. . . . In a vampire story told in Thalaba, by Southey, theresuscitated being takes the form of a dearly-beloved maiden, and the hero isobliged to kill her with his own hand. He does so; but, whilst he strikes theform of the loved one, he feels sure that he slays only a demon. In like manner,when I endeavor to destroy the current heathenism, which has assumed the garb ofChristianity, I do not attack real religion. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu101.htm#fn_110] Few would accuse a workmanof malignancy, who cleanses from filth the surface of a noble statue. There maybe some who are too nice to touch a nasty subject, yet even they will rejoicewhen some one else removes the dirt. Such a scavenger is wanted.\" ** But is it merely Pagans and heathen that the Catholics persecute, and aboutwhom, like Augustine, they cry to the Deity, \"Oh, my God! so do I wish Thyenemies to be slain\"? Oh, no! their aspirations are more Mosaic and Cain-likethan that. It is against their next of kin in faith, against their schismaticbrothers that they are now intriguing within the walls which sheltered themurderous Borgias. The larvae of the infanticidal, parricidal, and fratricidalPopes have proved themselves fit counsellors for the Cains of Castelfidardo andMentana. It is now the turn of the Slavonian Christians, the OrientalSchismatics--the Philistines of the Greek Church! His Holiness the Pope, after exhausting, in a metaphor of self-laudation, everypoint of assimilation between the great biblical prophets and himself, hasfinally and truly compared himself with the Patriarch Jacob \"wrestling againsthis God.\" He now crowns the edifice of Catholic piety by openly sympathizingwith the Turks! The vicegerent of God inaugurates his infallibility byencouraging, in a true Christian spirit, the acts of that Moslem David, themodern Bashi-Bazuk; and it seems as if nothing would more please his Holinessthan to be presented by the latter with several thousands of the Bulgarian orServian \"foreskins.\" True to her policy to be all things to all men to promoteher own interests, the Romish Church is, at this writing (1876), benevolentlyviewing the Bulgarian and Servian atrocities, and, probably, manoeuvring withTurkey against Russia. Better Islam, and the hitherto-hated Crescent over thesepulchre of the Christian god, than the Greek Church established atConstantinople and Jerusalem as the state religion. Like a decrepit andtoothless ex-tyrant in exile, the Vatican is eager for any alliance thatpromises, if not a restoration of its own power, at least the weakening of itsrival. The axe its inquisitors once swung, it now toys with in secret, feelingits edge, and waiting, and hoping against hope. In her time, the Popish Churchhas lain with strange bedfellows, but never before now sunk to the degradationof giving her moral support to those who for over 1200 years spat in her face,called her adherents \"infidel dogs,\" repudiated her teachings, and deniedgodhood to her God! The press of even Catholic France is fairly aroused at this indignity, andopenly accuses the Ultramontane portion of the Catholic Church and the Vaticanof siding, during the present Eastern struggle, with the Mahometan against theChristian. \"When the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the French Legislature spokesome mild words in favor of the Greek Christians, he was only applauded by theliberal Catholics, and received coldly by the Ultramontane party,\" says theFrench correspondent of a New York paper. \"So pronounced was this, that M. Lemoinne, the well-known editor of the greatliberal Catholic journal, the Debats, was moved to say that the Roman Churchfelt more sympathy for the Moslem than the schismatic, just as they preferred aninfidel to the Protestant. 'There is at bottom,' says this writer, 'a greataffinity between the Syllabus and the Koran, and between the two heads of thefaithful. The two systems are of the same nature, and are united on the commonground of a one and unchangeable theory.' In Italy, in like manner, the King andLiberal Catholics are in warm sympathy with the unfortunate Christians, whilethe Pope and Ultramontane faction are believed to be inclining to theMahometans.\" The civilized world may yet expect the apparition of the materialized VirginMary within the walls of the Vatican. The so often-repeated \"miracle\" of theImmaculate Visitor in the mediaeval ages has recently been enacted at Lourdes,and why not once more, as a coup de grace to all heretics, schismatics, andinfidels? The miraculous wax taper is yet seen at Arras, the chief city ofArtois; and at every new calamity threatening her beloved Church, the \"BlessedLady\" appears personally, and lights it with her own fair hands, in view of awhole \"biologized\" congregation. This sort of \"miracle,\" says E. Worsley,wrought by the Roman Catholic Church, \"being most certain, and never doubted ofby any.\" *Neither has the private correspondence with which the most \"GraciousLady\" honors her friends been doubted. There are two precious missives from herin the archives of the Church. The first purports to be a letter in answer toone addressed to her by Ignatius. She confirms all things learned by hercorrespondent from \"her friend\" --meaning the Apostle John. She bids him holdfast to his vows, and adds as an inducement: \"I and John will come together andpay you a visit.\" * Nothing was known of this unblushing fraud till the letters were published atParis, in 1495. By a curious accident it appeared at a time when threateninginquiries began to be made as to the genuineness of the fourth Synoptic. Whocould doubt, after such a confirmation from headquarters! But the climax ofeffrontery was capped in 1534, when another letter was received from the\"Mediatrix,\" which sounds more like the report of a lobby-agent to abrother-politician. It was written in excellent Latin, and was found in theCathedral of Messina, together with the image to which it alludes. Its contentsrun as follows: \"Mary Virgin, Mother of the Redeemer of the world, to the Bishop, Clergy, andthe other faithful of Messina, sendeth health and benediction from herself andson: **\"Whereas ye have been mindful of establishing the worship of me; now this is tolet you know that by so doing ye have found great favor in my sight. I have along time reflected with pain upon your city, which is exposed to much dangerfrom its contiguity to the fire of Etna, and I have often had words about itwith my son, for he was vexed with you because of your guilty neglect of myworship, so that he would not care a pin about my intercession. Now, however,that you have come to your senses, and have happily begun to worship me, he hasconferred upon me the right to become your everlasting protectress; but, at thesame time, I warn you to mind what you are about, and give me no cause ofrepenting of my kindness to you. The prayers and festivals instituted in myhonor please me tremendously (vehementer), and if you faithfully persevere inthese things, and provided you oppose to the utmost of your power, the hereticswhich now-a-days are spreading through the world, by which both my worship andthat of the other saints, male and female, are so endangered, you shall enjoy myperpetual protection.\"In sign of this compact, I send you down from Heaven the image of myself, castby celestial hands, and if ye hold it in the honor to which it is entitled, itwill be an evidence to me of your obedience and your faith. Farewell. Dated inHeaven, whilst sitting near the throne of my son, in the month of December, ofthe 1534th year from his incarnation.\"MARY VIRGIN\"The reader should understand that this document is no anti-Catholic forgery. Theauthor from whom it is taken, *** says that the authenticity of the missive \"isattested by the Bishop himself, his Vicar-General,Secretary, and six Canons ofthe Cathedral Church of Messina, all of whom have signed that attestation withtheir names, and confirmed it upon oath. \"Both the epistle and image were found upon the high altar, where they had beenplaced by angels from heaven.\" A Church must have reached the last stages of degradation, when suchsacrilegious trickery as this could be resorted to by its clergy, and acceptedwith or without question by the people. No! far from the man who feels the workings of an immortal spirit within him, besuch a religion! There never was nor ever will be a truly philosophical mind,whether of Pagan, heathen, Jew, or Christian, but has followed the same path ofthought. Gautama-Buddha is mirrored in the precepts of Christ; Paul and PhiloJudaeus are faithful echoes of Plato; and Ammonius Saccas and Plotinus won theirimmortal fame by combining the teachings of all these grand masters of truephilosophy. \"Prove all things; hold fast that which is good,\" ought to be themotto of all brothers on earth. Not so is it with the interpreters of the Bible.The seed of the Reformation was sown on the day that the second chapter of TheCatholic Epistle of James, jostled the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to theHebrews in the same New Testament. One who believes in Paul cannot believe inJames, Peter, and John. The Paulists, to remain Christians with their apostle,must withstand Peter \"to the face\"; and if Peter \"was to be blamed\" and waswrong, then he was not infallible. How then can his successor (?) boast of hisinfallibility? Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation;and every house divided against itself must fall. A plurality of masters hasproved as fatal in religions as in politics. What Paul preached, was preached byevery other mystic philosopher. \"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewithChrist hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage!\"exclaims the honest apostle-philosopher; and adds, as if prophetically inspired:\"But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one ofanother.\" That the Neo-platonists were not always despised or accused of demonolatry isevidenced in the adoption by the Roman Church of their very rites and theurgy.The identical evocations and incantations of the Pagan and Jewish Kabalist, arenow repeated by the Christian exorcist, and the theurgy of Iamblichus wasadopted word for word. \"Distinct as were the Platonists and Pauline Christiansof the earlier centuries,\" writes Professor A. Wilder, \"many of the moredistinguished teachers of the new faith were deeply tinctured with thephilosophical leaven. Synesius, the Bishop of Cyrene, was the disciple ofHypatia. St. Anthony reiterated the theurgy of Iamblichus. The Logos, or word ofthe Gospel according to John, was a Gnostic personification. Clement ofAlexandria, Origen, and others of the fathers drank deeply from the fountains ofphilosophy. The ascetic idea which carried away the Church was like that whichwas practiced by Plotinus . . . all through the middle ages there rose up menwho accepted the interior doctrines which were promulgated by the renownedteacher of the Academy.\" * To substantiate our accusation that the Latin Church first despoiled thekabalists and theurgists of their magical rites and ceremonies, before hurlinganathemas upon their devoted heads, we will now translate for the readerfragments from the forms of exorcism employed by kabalists and Christians. Theidentity in phraseology, may, perhaps, disclose one of the reasons why theRomish Church has always desired to keep the faithful in ignorance of themeaning of her Latin prayers and ritual. Only those directly interested in thedeception have had the opportunity to compare the rituals of the Church and themagicians. The best Latin scholars were, until a comparatively recent date,either churchmen, or dependent upon the Church. Common people could not readLatin, and even if they could, the reading of the books on magic was prohibited,under the penalty of anathema and excommunication. The cunning device of theconfessional made it almost impossible to consult, even surreptitiously, whatthe priests call a grimoire (a devil's scrawl), or Ritual of Magic. To makeassurance doubly sure, the Church began destroying or concealing everything ofthe kind she could lay her hands upon. The following are translated from the Kabalistic Ritual, and that generallyknown as the Roman Ritual. The latter was promulgated in 1851 and 1852, underthe sanction of Cardinal Engelbert, Archbishop of Malines, and of the Archbishopof Paris. Speaking of it, the demonologist des Mousseaux says: \"It is the ritualof Paul V., revised by the most learned of modern Popes, by the contemporary ofVoltaire, Benedict XIV.\" ** KABALISTIC. (Jewish and Pagan.)Exorcism of Salt.The Priest-Magician blesses the Salt, and says: \"Creature of Salt, *** in theemay remain the WISDOM (of God); and may it preserve from all corruption ourminds and ROMAN CATHOLICExorcism of Salt. ****The Priest blesses the Salt and says: \"Creature of Salt, I exorcise thee in thename of the living God . . . become the health of the soul and of the body!Every where bodies.Through Hochmael (God of wisdom), and the power of Ruach Hochmael (Spirit of theHoly Ghost) may the Spirits of matter (bad spirits) before it recede. . . .Amen.\"Exorcism of Water(and Ashes).\"Creature of the Water, I exorcise thee . . . by the three names which areNetsah, Hod, and Jerod (kabalistic trinity), in the beginning and in the end, byAlpha and Omega, which are in the Spirit Azoth (Holy Ghost, or the 'UniversalSoul'), I exorcise and adjure thee. . . . Wandering eagle, may the Lord commandthee by the wings of the bull and his flaming sword.\" (The cherub placed at theeast gate of Eden.)Exorcism of an Elemental Spirit.\"Serpent, in the name of the Tetragrammaton, the Lord; He commands thee, by theangel and the lion.\"Angel of darkness, obey, and run away with this holy (exorcised) water. Eaglein chains, obey this sign, and retreat before the breath. Moving serpent, crawlat my feet, or be tortured by this sacred fire, and evaporate before this holyincense. Let water return to water (the elemental spirit of water); let the fireburn, and the air circulate; let the earth return to earth by the virtue of thePentagram, which is the Morning Star, and in the name of the tetragrammatonwhich is traced in the centre of the Cross of Light. Amen.\" where thou art thrown may the unclean spirit be put to flight. . . . Amen.\"Exorcism of Water.\"Creature of the water, in the name of the Almighty God, the Father, the Son,and the Holy Ghost . . . be exorcised. . . . I adjure thee in the name of theLamb . . .

The more whilst thoudecay, the more terrible will be thy torture . . . by Him who reigns over theliving and the dead . . . and who will judge the century by fire, saeculum perignem, etc. In the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.\" * It is unnecessary to try the patience of the reader any longer, although wemight multiply examples. It must not be forgotten that we have quoted from thelatest revision of the Ritual, that of 1851-2. If we were to go back to theformer one we would find a far more striking identity, not merely of phraseologybut of ceremonial form. For the purpose of comparison we have not even availedourselves of the ritual of ceremonial magic of the Christian kabalists of themiddle ages, wherein the language modelled upon a belief in the divinity ofChrist is, with the exception of a stray expression here and there, identicalwith the Catholic Ritual. * The latter, however, makes one improvement, for theoriginality of which the Church should be allowed all credit. Certainly nothingso fantastical could be found in a ritual of magic. \"Give place,\" apostrophizingthe \"Demon,\" it says, \"give place to Jesus Christ . . . thou filthy, stinking,and ferocious beast . . . dost thou rebel? Listen and tremble, Satan; enemy ofthe faith, enemy of the human race, introducer of death . . . root of all evil,promoter of vice, soul of envy, origin of avarice, cause of discord, prince ofhomicide, whom God curses; author of incest and sacrilege, inventor of allobscenity, professor of the most detestable actions, and Grand Master ofHeretics (!!) (Doctor Haereticorum!) What! . . . dost thou still stand? Dostdare to resist, and thou knowest that Christ, our Lord, is coming? . . . Giveplace to Jesus Christ, give place to the Holy Ghost, which, by His blessedApostle Peter, has flung thee down before the public, in the person of Simon theMagician\" (te manifeste stravit in Simone mago). ** After such a shower of abuse, no devil having the slightest feeling ofself-respect could remain in such company; unless, indeed, he should chance tobe an Italian Liberal, or King Victor Emmanuel himself both of whom, thanks toPius IX., have become anathema-proof. It really seems too bad to strip Rome of all her symbols at once; but justicemust be done to the despoiled hierophants. Long before the sign of the Cross wasadopted as a Christian symbol, it was employed as a secret sign of recognitionamong neophytes and adepts. Says Levi: \"The sign of the Cross adopted by theChristians does not belong exclusively to them. It is kabalistic, and representsthe oppositions and quaternary equilibrium of the elements. We see by the occultverse of the Pater, to which we have called attention in another work, thatthere were originally two ways of making it, or, at least, two very differentformulas to express its meaning--one reserved for priests and initiates; theother given to neophytes and the profane. Thus, for example, the initiate,carrying his hand to his forehead, said: To thee; then he added, belong; andcontinued, while carrying his hand to the breast--the kingdom; then, to the leftshoulder--justice; to the right shoulder--and mercy. Then he joined the twohands, adding: throughout the generating cycles: 'Tibi sunt Malchut, et Geburahet Chassed per Æonas'--a sign of the Cross, absolutely and magnificentlykabalistic, which the profanations of Gnosticism made the militant and officialChurch completely lose.\" *** How fantastical, therefore, is the assertion of Father Ventura, that, whileAugustine was a Manichean, a philosopher, ignorant of and refusing to humblehimself before the sublimity of the \"grand Christian revelation,\" he knewnothing, understood naught of God, man, or universe; \". . . he remained poor,small, obscure, sterile, and wrote nothing, did nothing really grand or useful.\"But, hardly had he become a Christian \". . . when his reasoning powers andintellect, enlightened at the luminary of faith, elevated him to the mostsublime heights of philosophy and theology.\" And his other proposition thatAugustine's genius, as a consequence, \"developed itself in all its grandeur andprodigious fecundity . . . his intellect radiated with that immense splendorwhich, reflecting itself in his immortal writings, has never ceased for onemoment during fourteen centuries to illuminate the Church and the world\"! * Whatever Augustine was as a Manichean, we leave Father Ventura to discover; butthat his accession to Christianity established an everlasting enmity betweentheology and science is beyond doubt. While forced to confess that \"the Gentileshad possibly something divine and true in their doctrines,\" he, nevertheless,declared that for their superstition, idolatry, and pride, they had \"to bedetested, and, unless they improved, to be punished by divine judgment.\" Thisfurnishes the clew to the subsequent policy of the Christian Church, even to ourday. If the Gentiles did not choose to come into the Church, all that was divinein their philosophy should go for naught, and the divine wrath of God should bevisited upon their heads. What effect this produced is succinctly stated byDraper: \"No one did more than this Father to bring science and religion intoantagonism; it was mainly he who diverted the Bible from its true office--aguide to purity of life--and placed it in the perilous position of being thearbiter of human knowledge, an audacious tyranny over the mind of man. Theexample once set, there was no want of followers; the works of the Greekphilosophers were stigmatized as profane; the transcendently gloriousachievements of the Museum of Alexandria were hidden from sight by a cloud ofignorance, mysticism, and unintelligible jargon, out of which there too oftenflashed the destroying lightnings of ecclesiastical vengeance.\" ** Augustine and Cyprian *** admit that Hermes and Hostanes believed in one truegod; the first two maintaining, as well as the two Pagans, that he is invisibleand incomprehensible, except spiritually. Moreover we invite any man ofintelligence--provided he be not a religious fanatic--after reading fragmentschosen at random from the works of Hermes and Augustine on the Deity, to decidewhich of the two gives a more philosophical definition of the \"unseen Father.\"We have at least one writer of fame who is of our opinion. Draper calls theAugustinian productions a \"rhapsodical conversation\" with God; an \"incoherentdream.\" * Father Ventura depicts the saint as attitudinizing before an astonished worldupon \"the most sublime heights of philosophy.\" But here steps in again the sameunprejudiced critic, who passes the following remarks on this colossus ofPatristic philosophy. \"Was it for this preposterous scheme,\" he asks, \"thisproduct of ignorance and audacity, that the works of the Greek philosophers wereto be given up? It was none too soon that the great critics who appeared at theReformation, by comparing the works of these writers with one another, broughtthem to their proper level, and taught us to look upon them all withcontempt.\" ** For such men as Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Apollonius, and even SimonMagus, to be accused of having formed a pact with the Devil, whether the latterpersonage exist or not, is so absurd as to need but little refutation. If SimonMagus--the most problematical of all in an historical sense--ever existedotherwise than in the overheated fancy of Peter and the other apostles, he wasevidently no worse than any of his adversaries. A difference in religious views,however great, is insufficient per se to send one person to heaven and the otherto hell. Such uncharitable and peremptory doctrines might have been taught inthe middle ages; but it is too late now for even the Church to put forward thistraditional scarecrow. Research begins to suggest that which, if ever verified,will bring eternal disgrace on the Church of the Apostle Peter, whose veryimposition of herself upon that disciple must be regarded as the most unverifiedand unverifiable of the assumptions of the Catholic clergy. The erudite author of Supernatural Religion assiduously endeavors to prove thatby Simon Magus we must understand the apostle Paul, whose Epistles were secretlyas well as openly calumniated by Peter, and charged with containing \"dysnoeticlearning.\" The Apostle of the Gentiles was brave, outspoken, sincere, and verylearned; the Apostle of Circumcision, cowardly, cautious, insincere, and veryignorant. That Paul had been, partially, at least, if not completely, initiatedinto the theurgic mysteries, admits of little doubt. His language, thephraseology so peculiar to the Greek philosophers, certain expressions used butby the initiates, are so many sure ear-marks to that supposition. Our suspicionhas been strengthened by an able article in one of the New York periodicals,entitled Paul and Plato, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu101.htm#fn_129]in which the author puts forward one remarkable and, for us, very preciousobservation. In his Epistles to the Corinthians he shows Paul abounding with\"expressions suggested by the initiations of Sabazius and Eleusis, and thelectures of the (Greek) philosophers. He (Paul) designates himself an idiotes--aperson unskilful in the Word, but not in the gnosis or philosophical learning.'We speak wisdom among the perfect or initiated,' he writes; 'not the wisdom ofthis world, nor of the archons of this world, but divine wisdom in a mystery,secret--which none of the Archons of this world knew.' \" **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu101.htm#fn_130] What else can the apostlemean by these unequivocal words, but that he himself, as belonging to the mystae(initiated), spoke of things shown and explained only in the Mysteries? The\"divine wisdom in a mystery which none of the archons of this world knew,\" hasevidently some direct reference to the basileus of the Eleusinian initiation whodid know. The basileus belonged to the staff of the great hierophant, and was anarchon of Athens; and as such was one of the chief mystae, belonging to theinterior Mysteries, to which a very select and small number obtained anentrance. *** The magistrates supervising the Eleusinians were called archons. Another proof that Paul belonged to the circle of the \"Initiates\" lies in thefollowing fact. The apostle had his head shorn at Cenchrea (where Lucius,Apulcius, was initiated) because \"he had a vow.\" The nazars--or set apart--as wesee in the Jewish Scriptures, had to cut their hair which they wore long, andwhich \"no razor touched\" at any other time, and sacrifice it on the altar ofinitiation. And the nazars were a class of Chaldean theurgists. We will showfurther that Jesus belonged to this class. Paul declares that: \"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as awise master-builder, I have laid the foundation.\" **** This expression, master-builder, used only once in the whole Bible, and by Paul,may be considered as a whole revelation. In the Mysteries, the third part of thesacred rites was called Epopteia, or revelation, reception into the secrets. Insubstance it means that stage of divine clairvoyance when everything pertainingto this earth disappears, and earthly sight is paralyzed, and the soul is unitedfree and pure with its Spirit, or God. But the real significance of the word is\"overseeing,\" from οπτομαι--I see myself. In Sanscrit the word evapto has thesame meaning, as well as to obtain. * The word epopteia is a compound one, fromΕπι--upon, and οπτομαι-- to look, or an overseer, an inspector--also used for amaster-builder. The title of master-mason, in Freemasonry, is derived from this,in the sense used in the Mysteries. Therefore, when Paul entitles himself a\"master-builder,\" he is using a word pre-eminently kabalistic, theurgic, andmasonic, and one which no other apostle uses. He thus declares himself an adept,having the right to initiate others. If we search in this direction, with those sure guides, the Grecian Mysteriesand the Kabala, before us, it will be easy to find the secret reason why Paulwas so persecuted and hated by Peter, John, and James. The author of theRevelation was a Jewish kabalist pur sang, with all the hatred inherited by himfrom his forefathers toward the Mysteries. ** His jealousy during the life ofJesus extended even to Peter; and it is but after the death of their commonmaster that we see the two apostles--the former of whom wore the Mitre and thePetaloon of the Jewish Rabbis--preach so zealously the rite of circumcision. Inthe eyes of Peter, Paul, who had humiliated him, and whom he felt so much hissuperior in \"Greek learning\" and philosophy, must have naturally appeared as amagician, a man polluted with the \"Gnosis,\" with the \"wisdom\" of the GreekMysteries--hence, perhaps, \"Simon *** the Magician.\" As to Peter, biblical criticism has shown before now that he had probably nomore to do with the foundation of the Latin Church at Rome, than to furnish thepretext so readily seized upon by the cunning Irenaeus to benefit this Churchwith the new name of the apostle--Petra or Kiffa, a name which allowed soreadily, by an easy play upon words to connect it with Petroma, the double setof stone tablets used by the hierophant at the initiations, during the finalMystery. In this, perhaps, lies concealed the whole secret of the claims of theVatican. As Professor Wilder happily suggests: \"In the Oriental countries thedesignation [images/00026.jpg], Peter (in Phoenician and Chaldaic, aninterpreter) appears to have been the title of this personage (the hierophant).. . . There is in these facts some reminder of the peculiar circumstances of theMosaic Law . . . and also of the claim of the Pope to be the successor of Peter,the hierophant or interpreter of the Christian religion.\" * As such, we must concede to him, to some extent, the right to be such aninterpreter. The Latin Church has faithfully preserved in symbols, rites,ceremonies, architecture, and even in the very dress of her clergy, thetradition of the Pagan worship--of the public or exoteric ceremonies, we shouldadd; otherwise her dogmas would embody more sense and contain less blasphemyagainst the majesty of the Supreme and Invisible God. An inscription found on the coffin of Queen Mentuhept, of the eleventh dynasty(2250 B.C.), now proved to have been transcribed from the seventeenth chapter ofthe Book of the Dead (dating not later than 4500 B.C.), is more than suggestive.This monumental text contains a group of hieroglyphics, which, when interpreted,read thus: [images/00027.jpg]Baron Bunsen shows this sacred formulary mixed up with a whole series of glossesand various interpretations on a monument forty centuries old. \"This isidentical with saying that the record (the true interpretation) was at that timeno longer intelligible. . . . We beg our readers to understand,\" he adds, \"thata sacred text, a hymn, containing the words of a departed spirit, existed insuch a state about 4,000 years ago . . . as to be all but unintelligible toroyal scribes.\" ** That it was unintelligible to the uninitiated among the latter is as well provedby the confused and contradictory glossaries, as that it was a \"mystery\"-word,known to the hierophants of the sanctuaries, and, moreover, a word chosen byJesus, to designate the office assigned by him to one of his apostles. Thisword, PTR, was partially interpreted, owing to another word similarly written inanother group of hieroglyphics, on a stele, the sign used for it being an openedeye. * Bunsen mentions as another explanation of PTR--\"to show.\" \"It appears tome,\" he remarks, \"that our PTR is literally the old Aramaic and Hebrew 'Patar,'which occurs in the history of Joseph as the specific word for interpreting;whence also Pitrum is the term for interpretation of a text, a dream.\" ** In amanuscript of the first century, a combination of the Demotic and Greektexts, *** and most probably one of the few which miraculously escaped theChristian vandalism of the second and third centuries, when all such preciousmanuscripts were burned as magical, we find occurring in several places aphrase, which, perhaps, may throw some light upon this question. One of theprincipal heroes of the manuscript, who is constantly referred to as \"the JudeanIlluminator\" or Initiate, Τελειοτεσ, is made to communicate but with his Patar;the latter being written in Chaldaic characters. Once the latter word is coupledwith the name Shimeon. Several times, the \"Illuminator,\" who rarely breaks hiscontemplative solitude, is shown inhabiting a Κρυπτε (cave), and teaching themultitudes of eager scholars standing outside, not orally, but through thisPatar. The latter receives the words of wisdom by applying his ear to a circularhole in a partition which conceals the teacher from the listeners, and thenconveys them, with explanations and glossaries, to the crowd. This, with aslight change, was the method used by Pythagoras, who, as we know, never allowedhis neophytes to see him during the years of probation, but instructed them frombehind a curtain in his cave. But, whether the \"Illuminator\" of the Graeco-Demotic manuscript is identicalwith Jesus or not, the fact remains, that we find him selecting a\"mystery\"-appellation for one who is made to appear later by the Catholic Churchas the janitor of the Kingdom of Heaven and the interpreter of Christ's will.The word Patar or Peter locates both master and disciple in the circle ofinitiation, and connects them with the \"Secret Doctrine.\" The great hierophantof the ancient Mysteries never allowed the candidates to see or hear himpersonally. He was the Deus-ex-Machina, the presiding but invisible Deity,uttering his will and instructions through a second party; and 2,000 yearslater, we discover that the Dalai-Lamas of Thibet had been following forcenturies the same traditional programme during the most important religiousmysteries of lamaism. If Jesus knew the secret meaning of the title bestowed by him on Simon, then hemust have been initiated; otherwise he could not have learned it; and if he wasan initiate of either the Pythagorean Essenes, the Chaldean Magi, or theEgyptian Priests, then the doctrine taught by him was but a portion of the\"Secret Doctrine\" taught by the Pagan hierophants to the few select adeptsadmitted within the sacred adyta. But we will discuss this question further on. For the present we will endeavorto briefly indicate the extraordinary similarity--or rather identity, we shouldsay--of rites and ceremonial dress of the Christian clergy with that of the oldBabylonians, Assyrians, Phoenicians, Egyptians, and other Pagans of the hoaryantiquity. If we would find the model of the Papal tiara, we must search the annals of theancient Assyrian tablets. We invite the reader to give his attention to Dr.Inman's illustrated work, Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism. On pagesixty-four, he will readily recognize the head-gear of the successor of St.Peter in the coiffure worn by gods or angels in ancient Assyria, \"where itappears crowned by an emblem of the male trinity\" (the Christian Cross). \"We maymention, in passing,\" adds Dr. Inman, \"that, as the Romanists adopted the mitreand the tiara from 'the cursed brood of Ham,' so they adopted the Episcopaliancrook from the augurs of Etruria, and the artistic form with which they clothetheir angels from the painters and urn-makers of Magna Grecia and CentralItaly.\" Would we push our inquiries farther, and seek to ascertain as much in relationto the nimbus and the tonsure of the Catholic priest and monk? * We shall findundeniable proofs that they are solar emblems. Knight, in his Old EnglandPictorially Illustrated, gives a drawing by St. Augustine, representing anancient Christian bishop, in a dress probably identical with that worn by thegreat \"saint\" himself. The pallium, or the ancient stole of the bishop, is thefeminine sign when worn by a priest in worship. On St. Augustine's picture it isbedecked with Buddhistic crosses, and in its whole appearance it is arepresentation of the Egyptian [images/00011.jpg](tau), assuming slightly thefigure of the letter [images/00028.jpg]. \"Its lower end is the mark of themasculine triad,\" says Inman; \"the right hand (of the figure) has the forefingerextended, like the Assyrian priests while doing homage to the grove. . . . Whena male dons the pallium in worship, he becomes the representative of the trinityin the unity, the arba, or mystic four.\" ** \"Immaculate is our Lady Isis,\" is the legend around an engraving of Serapis andIsis, described by King, in The Gnostics and their Remains, Ἐ ΚΥΡΙΑ ΕΙΚΙΚ ΑΓΝΕ\". . . the very terms applied afterwards to that personage (the Virgin Mary) whosucceeded to her form, titles, symbols, rites, and ceremonies. . . . Thus, herdevotees carried into the new priesthood the former badges of their profession,the obligation to celibacy, the tonsure, and the surplice, omitting,unfortunately, the frequent ablutions prescribed by the ancient creed.\" \"The'Black Virgins,' so highly reverenced in certain French cathedrals . . . proved,when at last critically examined, basalt figures of Isis\"! * Before the shrine of Jupiter Ammon were suspended tinkling bells, from the soundof whose chiming the priests gathered the auguries; \"A golden bell and apomegranate . . . round about the hem of the robe,\" was the result with theMosaic Jews. But in the Buddhistic system, during the religious services, thegods of the Deva Loka are always invoked, and invited to descend upon the altarsby the ringing of bells suspended in the pagodas. The bell of the sacred tableof Siva at Kuhama is described in Kailasa, and every Buddhist vihara andlamasery has its bells. We thus see that the bells used by Christians come to them directly from theBuddhist Thibetans and Chinese. The beads and rosaries have the same origin, andhave been used by Buddhist monks for over 2,300 years. The Linghams in the Hindutemples are ornamented upon certain days with large berries, from a tree sacredto Mahadeva, which are strung into rosaries. The title of \"nun\" is an Egyptianword, and had with them the actual meaning; the Christians did not even take thetrouble of translating the word Nonna. The aureole of the saints was used by theantediluvian artists of Babylonia, whenever they desired to honor or deify amortal's head. In a celebrated picture in Moore's Hindoo Pantheon, entitled,\"Christna nursed by Devaki, from a highly-finished picture,\" the Hindu Virgin isrepresented as seated on a lounge and nursing Christna. The hair brushed back,the long veil, and the golden aureole around the Virgin's head, as well asaround that of the Hindu Saviour, are striking. No Catholic, well versed as hemight be in the mysterious symbolism of iconology, would hesitate for a momentto worship at that shrine the Virgin Mary, the mother of his God! **In IndurSubba, the south entrance of the Caves of Ellora, may be seen to this day thefigure of Indra's wife, Indranee, sitting with her infant son-god, pointing thefinger to heaven with the same gesture as the Italian Madonna and child. InPagan and Christian Symbolism, the author gives a figure from a mediaevalwoodcut--the like of which we have seen by dozens in old psalters--in which theVirgin Mary, with her infant, is represented as the Queen of Heaven, on thecrescent moon, emblem of virginity. \"Being before the sun, she almost eclipsesits light. Than this, nothing could more completely identify the Christianmother and child with Isis and Horus, Ishtar, Venus, Juno, and a host of otherPagan goddesses, who have been called 'Queen of Heaven,' 'Queen of theUniverse,' 'Mother of God,' 'Spouse of God,' 'the Celestial Virgin,' 'theHeavenly Peace-Maker,' etc.\" * Such pictures are not purely astronomical. They represent the male god and thefemale goddess, as the sun and moon in conjunction, \"the union of the triad withthe unit.\" The horns of the cow on the head of Isis have the same significance. And so above, below, outside, and inside, the Christian Church, in the priestlygarments, and the religious rites, we recognize the stamp of exotericheathenism. On no subject within the wide range of human knowledge, has theworld been more blinded or deceived with such persistent misrepresentation as onthat of antiquity. Its hoary past and its religious faiths have beenmisrepresented and trampled under the feet of its successors. Its hierophantsand prophets, mystae and epoptae, ** of the once sacred adyta of the templeshown as demoniacs and devil-worshippers. Donned in the despoiled garments ofthe victim, the Christian priest now anathematizes the latter with rites andceremonies which he has learned from the theurgists themselves. The Mosaic Bibleis used as a weapon against the people who furnished it. The heathen philosopheris cursed under the very roof which has witnessed his initiation; and the\"monkey of God\" (i.e., the devil of Tertullian), \"the originator and founder ofmagical theurgy, the science of illusions and lies, whose father and author isthe demon,\" is exorcised with holy water by the hand which holds the identicallituus *** with which the ancient augur, after a solemn prayer, used todetermine the regions of heaven, and evoke, in the name of the HIGHEST, theminor god (now termed the Devil), who unveiled to his eyes futurity, and enabledhim to prophesy! On the part of the Christians and the clergy it is nothing butshameful ignorance, prejudice, and that contemptible pride so boldly denouncedby one of their own reverend ministers, T. Gross, **** which rails against allinvestigation \"as a useless or a criminal labor, when it must be feared thatthey will result in the overthrow of preestablished systems of faith.\" On thepart of the scholars it is the same apprehension of the possible necessity ofhaving to modify some of their erroneously-established theories of science.\"Nothing but such pitiable prejudice,\" says Gross, \"can have thus misrepresentedthe theology of heathenism, and distorted--nay, caricatured--its forms ofreligious worship. It is time that posterity should raise its voice invindication of violated truth, and that the present age should learn a little ofthat common sense of which it boasts with as much self-complacency as if theprerogative of reason was the birthright only of modern times.\" All this gives a sure clew to the real cause of the hatred felt by the early andmediaeval Christian toward his Pagan brother and dangerous rival. We hate butwhat we fear. The Christian thaumaturgist once having broken all associationwith the Mysteries of the temples and with \"these schools so renowned formagic,\" described by St. Hilarion, * could certainly expect but little to rivalthe Pagan wonder-workers. No apostle, with the exception perhaps of healing bymesmeric power, has ever equalled Apollonius of Tyana; and the scandal createdamong the apostles by the miracle-doing Simon Magus, is too notorious to berepeated here again. \"How is it,\" asks Justin Martyr, in evident dismay, \"how isit that the talismans of Apollonius (the τελεσματα) have power in certainmembers of creation, for they prevent, as we see, the fury of the waves, and theviolence of the winds, and the attacks of wild beasts; and whilst our Lord'smiracles are preserved by tradition alone, those of Apollonius are mostnumerous, and actually manifested in present facts, so as to lead astray allbeholders?\" ** This perplexed martyr solves the problem by attributing verycorrectly the efficacy and potency of the charms used by Apollonius to hisprofound knowledge of the sympathies and antipathies (or repugnances) of nature. Unable to deny the evident superiority of their enemies' powers, the fathers hadrecourse to the old but ever successful method--that of slander. They honoredthe theurgists with the same insinuating calumny that had been resorted to bythe Pharisees against Jesus. \"Thou hast a daemon,\" the elders of the JewishSynagogue had said to him. \"Thou hast the Devil,\" repeated the cunning fathers,with equal truth, addressing the Pagan thaumaturgist; and the widely-bruitedcharge, erected later into an article of faith, won the day. But the modern heirs of these ecclesiastical falsifiers, who charge magic,spiritualism, and even magnetism with being produced by a demon, forget orperhaps never read the classics. None of our bigots has ever looked with morescorn on the abuses of magic than did the true initiate of old. No modern oreven mediaeval law could be more severe than that of the hierophant. True, hehad more discrimination, charity, and justice, than the Christian clergy; forwhile banishing the \"unconscious\" sorcerer, the person troubled with a demon,from within the sacred precincts of the adyta, the priests, instead ofmercilessly burning him, took care of the unfortunate \"possessed one.\" Havinghospitals expressly for that purpose in the neighborhood of temples, the ancient\"medium,\" if obsessed, was taken care of and restored to health. But with onewho had, by conscious witchcraft, acquired powers dangerous to hisfellow-creatures, the priests of old were as severe as justice herself. \"Anyperson accidentally guilty of homicide, or of any crime, or convicted ofwitchcraft, was excluded from the Eleusinian Mysteries.\" * And so were they fromall others. This law, mentioned by all writers on the ancient initiation, speaksfor itself. The claim of Augustine, that all the explanations given by theNeo-platonists were invented by themselves is absurd. For nearly every ceremonyin their true and successive order is given by Plato himself, in a more or lesscovered way. The Mysteries are as old as the world, and one well versed in theesoteric mythologies of various nations can trace them back to the days of theante-Vedic period in India. A condition of the strictest virtue and purity isrequired from the Vatou, or candidate in India before he can become an initiate,whether he aims to be a simple fakir, a Purohita (public priest) or a Sannyasi,a saint of the second degree of initiation, the most holy as the most revered ofthem all. After having conquered, in the terrible trials preliminary toadmittance to the inner temple in the subterranean crypts of his pagoda, thesannyasi passes the rest of his life in the temple, practicing the eighty-fourrules and ten virtues prescribed to the Yogis. \"No one who has not practiced, during his whole life, the ten virtues which thedivine Manu makes incumbent as a duty, can be initiated into the Mysteries ofthe council,\" say the Hindu books of initiation. These virtues are: \"Resignation; the act of rendering good for evil; temperance;probity; purity; chastity; repression of the physical senses; the knowledge ofthe Holy Scriptures; that of the Superior soul (spirit); worship of truth;abstinence from anger.\" These virtues must alone direct the life of a true Yogi.\"No unworthy adept ought to defile the ranks of the holy initiates by hispresence for twenty-four hours.\" The adept becomes guilty after having oncebroken any one of these vows. Surely the exercise of such virtues isinconsistent with the idea one has of devil-worship and lasciviousness ofpurpose! And now we will try to give a clear insight into one of the chief objects ofthis work. What we desire to prove is, that underlying every ancient popularreligion was the same ancient wisdom-doctrine, one and identical, professed andpracticed by the initiates of every country, who alone were aware of itsexistence and importance. To ascertain its origin, and the precise age in whichit was matured, is now beyond human possibility. A single glance, however, isenough to assure one that it could not have attained the marvellous perfectionin which we find it pictured to us in the relics of the various esotericsystems, except after a succession of ages. A philosophy so profound, a moralcode so ennobling, and practical results so conclusive and so uniformlydemonstrable is not the growth of a generation, or even a single epoch. Factmust have been piled upon fact, deduction upon deduction, science have begottenscience, and myriads of the brightest human intellects have reflected upon thelaws of nature, before this ancient doctrine had taken concrete shape. Theproofs of this identity of fundamental doctrine in the old religions are foundin the prevalence of a system of initiation; in the secret sacerdotal castes whohad the guardianship of mystical words of power, and a public display of aphenomenal control over natural forces, indicating association with preterhumanbeings. Every approach to the Mysteries of all these nations was guarded withthe same jealous care, and in all, the penalty of death was inflicted uponinitiates of any degree who divulged the secrets entrusted to them. We have seenthat such was the case in the Eleusinian and Bacchic Mysteries, among theChaldean Magi, and the Egyptian hierophants; while with the Hindus, from whomthey were all derived, the same rule has prevailed from time immemorial. We areleft in no doubt upon this point; for the Agrushada Parikshai says explicitly,\"Every initiate, to whatever degree he may belong, who reveals the great sacredformula, must be put to death.\" Naturally enough, this same extreme penalty was prescribed in all themultifarious sects and brotherhoods which at different periods have sprung fromthe ancient stock. We find it with the early Essenes, Gnostics, theurgicNeo-platonists, and mediaeval philosophers; and in our day, even the Masonsperpetuate the memory of the old obligations in the penalties of throat-cutting,dismemberment, and disemboweling, with which the candidate is threatened. As theMasonic \"master's word\" is communicated only at \"low breath,\" so the selfsameprecaution is prescribed in the Chaldean Book of Numbers and the Jewish Mercaba.When initiated, the neophyte was led by an ancient to a secluded spot, and therethe latter whispered in his ear the great secret. * The Mason swears, under themost frightful penalties, that he will not communicate the secrets of any degree\"to a brother of an inferior degree\"; and the Agrushada Parikshai says: \"Anyinitiate of the third degree who reveals before the prescribed time, to theinitiates of the second degree, the superior truths, must be put to death.\"Again, the Masonic apprentice consents to have his \"tongue torn out by theroots\" if he divulge anything to a profane; and in the Hindu books ofinitiation, the same Agrushada Parikshai, we find that any initiate of the firstdegree (the lowest) who betrays the secrets of his initiation, to members ofother castes, for whom the science should be a closed book, must have \"histongue cut out,\" and suffer other mutilations. As we proceed, we will point out the evidences of this identity of vows,formulas, rites, and doctrines, between the ancient faiths. We will also showthat not only their memory is still preserved in India, but also that the SecretAssociation is still alive and as active as ever. That, after reading what wehave to say, it may be inferred that the chief pontiff and hierophants, theBrahmatma, is still accessible to those \"who know,\" though perhaps recognized byanother name; and that the ramifications of his influence extend throughout theworld. But we will now return again to the early Christian period. As though he were not aware that there was any esoteric significance to theexoteric symbols, and that the Mysteries themselves were composed of two parts,the lesser at Agrae, and the higher ones at Eleusinia, Clemens Alexandrinus,with a rancorous bigotry that one might expect from a renegade Neo-platonist,but is astonished to find in this generally honest and learned Father,stigmatized the Mysteries as indecent and diabolical. Whatever were the ritesenacted among the neophytes before they passed to a higher form of instruction;however misunderstood were the trials of Katharsis or purification, during whichthey were submitted to every kind of probation; and however much the immaterialor physical aspect might have led to calumny, it is but wicked prejudice whichcan compel a person to say that under this external meaning there was not a fardeeper and spiritual significance. It is positively absurd to judge the ancients from our own standpoint ofpropriety and virtue. And most assuredly it is not for the Church--which nowstands accused by all the modern symbologists of having adopted precisely thesesame emblems in their coarsest aspect, and feels herself powerless to refute theaccusations--to throw the stone at those who were her models. When men likePythagoras, Plato, and Iamblichus, renowned for their severe morality, took partin the Mysteries, and spoke of them with veneration, it ill behooves our moderncritics to judge them so rashly upon their merely external aspects. Iamblichusexplains the worst; and his explanation, for an unprejudiced mind, ought to beperfectly plausible. \"Exhibitions of this kind,\" he says, \"in the Mysteries weredesigned to free us from licentious passions, by gratifying the sight, and atthe same time vanquishing all evil thought, through the awful sanctity withwhich these rites were accompanied.\" * \"The wisest and best men in the Paganworld,\" adds Dr. Warburton, \"are unanimous in this, that the Mysteries wereinstituted pure, and proposed the noblest ends by the worthiest means.\" ** In these celebrated rites, although persons of both sexes and all classes wereallowed to take a part, and a participation in them was even obligatory, veryfew indeed attained the higher and final initiation. The gradation of theMysteries is given us by Proclus in the fourth book of his Theology of Plato.\"The perfective rite τελετε, precedes in order the initiation--Muesis--and theinitiation, Epopteia, or the final apocalypse (revelation).\" Theon of Smyrna, inMathematica, also divides the mystic rites into five parts: \"the first of whichis the previous purification; for neither are the Mysteries communicated to allwho are willing to receive them; . . . there are certain persons who areprevented by the voice of the crier (Κερυξ) . . . since it is necessary thatsuch as are not expelled from the Mysteries should first be refined by certainpurifications which the reception of the sacred rites succeeds. The third partis denominated epopteia or reception. And the fourth, which is the end anddesign of the revelation, is the binding of the head and fixing of thecrowns *** . . . whether after this he (the initiated person) becomes . . . anhierophant or sustains some other part of the sacerdotal office. But the fifth,which is produced from all these, is friendship and interior communion withGod.\" And this was the last and most awful of all the Mysteries. There are writers who have often wondered at the meaning of this claim to a\"friendship and interior communion with God.\" Christian authors have denied thepretensions of the \"Pagans\" to such \"communion,\" affirming that only Christiansaints were and are capable of enjoying it; materialistic skeptics havealtogether scoffed at the idea of both. After long ages of religious materialismand spiritual stagnation, it has most certainly become difficult if notaltogether impossible to substantiate the claims of either party. The oldGreeks, who had once crowded around the Agora of Athens, with its altar to the\"Unknown God,\" are no more; and their descendants firmly believe that they havefound the \"Unknown\" in the Jewish Jehova. The divine ecstasies of the earlyChristians have made room for visions of a more modern character, in perfectkeeping with progress and civilization. The \"Son of man\" appearing to the raptvision of the ancient Christian as coming from the seventh heaven, in a cloud ofglory, and surrounded with angels and winged seraphim, has made room for a moreprosaic and at the same time more business-like Jesus. The latter is now shownas making morning calls upon Mary and Martha in Bethany; as seating himself on\"the ottoman\" with the younger sister, a lover of \"ethics,\" while Martha goesoff to the kitchen to cook. Anon the heated fancy of a blasphemous Brooklynpreacher and harlequin, the Reverend Dr. Talmage, makes us see her rushing back\"with besweated brow, a pitcher in one hand and the tongs in the other . . .into the presence of Christ,\" and blowing him up for not caring that her sisterhath left her \"to serve alone.\" * From the birth of the solemn and majestic conception of the unrevealed Deity ofthe ancient adepts to such caricatured descriptions of him who died on the Crossfor his philanthropic devotion to humanity, long centuries have intervened, andtheir heavy tread seems to have almost entirely obliterated all sense of aspiritual religion from the hearts of his professed followers. No wonder then,that the sentence of Proclus is no longer understood by the Christians, and isrejected as a \"vaglary\" by the materialists, who, in their negation, are lessblasphemous and atheistical than many of the reverends and members of thechurches. But, although the Greek epoptai are no more, we have now, in our ownage, a people far more ancient than the oldest Hellenes, who practice theso-called \"preterhuman\" gifts to the same extent as did their ancestors farearlier than the days of Troy. It is to this people that we draw the attentionof the psychologist and philosopher. One need not go very deep into the literature of the Orientalists to becomeconvinced that in most cases they do not even suspect that in the arcanephilosophy of India there are depths which they have not sounded, and cannotsound, for they pass on without perceiving them. There is a pervading tone ofconscious superiority, a ring of contempt in the treatment of Hindu metaphysics,as though the European mind is alone enlightened enough to polish the roughdiamond of the old Sanscrit writers, and separate right from wrong for thebenefit of their descendants. We see them disputing over the external forms ofexpression without a conception of the great vital truths these hide from theprofane view. \"As a rule, the Brahmans,\" says Jacolliot, \"rarely go beyond the class ofgrihesta [priests of the vulgar castes] and purahita [exorcisers, divines,prophets, and evocators of spirits]. And yet, we shall see . . . once that wehave touched upon the question and study of manifestations and phenomena, thatthese initiates of the first degree (the lowest) attribute to themselves, and inappearance possess faculties developed to a degree which has never been equalledin Europe. As to the initiates of the second and especially of the thirdcategory, they pretend to be enabled to ignore time, space, and to command lifeand death.\" * Such initiates as these M. Jacolliot did not meet; for, as he says himself, theyonly appear on the most solemn occasions, and when the faith of the multitudeshas to be strengthened by phenomena of a superior order. \"They are never seen,either in the neighborhood of, or even inside the temples, except at the grandquinquennial festival of the fire. On that occasion, they appear about themiddle of the night, on a platform erected in the centre of the sacred lake,like so many phantoms, and by their conjurations they illumine the space. Afiery column of light ascends from around them, rushing from earth to heaven.Unfamiliar sounds vibrate through the air, and five or six hundred thousandHindus, gathered from every part of India to contemplate these demi-gods, throwthemselves with their faces buried in the dust, invoking the souls of theirancestors.\" ** Let any impartial person read the Spiritisme dans le Monde, and he cannotbelieve that this \"implacable rationalist,\" as Jacolliot takes pride in terminghimself, said one word more than is warranted by what he had seen. Hisstatements support and are corroborated by those of other skeptics. As a rule,the missionaries, even after passing half a lifetime in the country of\"devil-worship,\" as they call India, either disingenuously deny altogether whatthey cannot help knowing to be true, or ridiculously attribute phenomena to thispower of the Devil, that outrival the \"miracles\" of the apostolic ages. And whatdo we see this French author, notwithstanding his incorrigible rationalism,forced to admit, after having narrated the greatest wonders? Watch the fakirs ashe would, he is compelled to bear the strongest testimony to their perfecthonesty in the matter of their miraculous phenomena. \"Never,\" he says, \"have wesucceeded in detecting a single one in the act of deceit.\" One fact should benoted by all who, without having been in India, still fancy they are cleverenough to expose the fraud of pretended magicians. This skilled and coolobserver, this redoubtable materialist, after his long sojourn in India,affirms, \"We unhesitatingly avow that we have not met, either in India or inCeylon, a single European, even among the oldest residents, who has been able toindicate the means employed by these devotees for the production of thesephenomena!\" And how should they? Does not this zealous Orientalist confess to us that evenhe, who had every available means at hand to learn many of their rites anddoctrines at first hand, failed in his attempts to make the Brahmans explain tohim their secrets. \"All that our most diligent inquiries of the Pourohitas couldelicit from them respecting the acts of their superiors (the invisible initiatesof the temples), amounts to very little.\" And again, speaking of one of thebooks, he confesses that, while purporting to reveal all that is desirable toknow, it \"falls back into mysterious formulas, in combinations of magical andoccult letters, the secret of which it has been impossible for us to penetrate,\"etc. The fakirs, although they can never reach beyond the first degree of initiation,are, notwithstanding, the only agents between the living world and the \"silentbrothers,\" or those initiates who never cross the thresholds of their sacreddwellings. The Fukara-Yogis belong to the temples, and who knows but thesecenobites of the sanctuary have far more to do with the psychological phenomenawhich attend the fakirs, and have been so graphically described by Jacolliot,than the Pitris themselves? Who can tell but that the fluidic spectre of theancient Brahman seen by Jacolliot was the Scin-lecca, the spiritual double, ofone of these mysterious sannyasi? Although the story has been translated and commented upon by Professor Perty, ofGeneva, still we will venture to give it in Jacolliot's own words: \"A momentafter the disappearance of the hands, the fakir continuing his evocations(mantras) more earnestly than ever, a cloud like the first, but more opalescentand more opaque, began to hover near the small brasier, which, by request of theHindu, I had constantly fed with live coals. Little by little it assumed a formentire human, and I distinguished the spectre--for I cannot call itotherwise--of an old Brahman sacrificator, kneeling near the little brasier. \"He bore on his forehead the signs sacred to Vishnu, and around his body thetriple cord, sign of the initiates of the priestly caste. He joined his handsabove his head, as during the sacrifices, and his lips moved as if they werereciting prayers. At a given moment, he took a pinch of perfumed powder, andthrew it upon the coals; it must have been a strong compound, for a thick smokearose on the instant, and filled the two chambers. \"When it was dissipated, I perceived the spectre, which, two steps from me, wasextending to me its fleshless hand; I took it in mine, making a salutation, andI was astonished to find it, although bony and hard, warm and living. \" 'Art thou, indeed,' said I at this moment, in a loud voice, 'an ancientinhabitant of the earth?' \"I had not finished the question, when the word AM, (yes) appeared and thendisappeared in letters of fire, on the breast of the old Brahman, with an effectmuch like that which the word would produce if written in the dark with a stickof phosphorus. \" 'Will you leave me nothing in token of your visit?' I continued. \"The spirit broke the triple cord, composed of three strands of cotton, whichbegirt his loins, gave it to me, and vanished at my feet.\" * \"Oh Brahma! what is this mystery which takes place every night? . . . When lyingon the matting, with eyes closed, the body is lost sight of, and the soulescapes to enter into conversation with the Pitris. . . . Watch over it, OBrahma, when, forsaking the resting body, it goes away to hover over the waters,to wander in the immensity of heaven, and penetrate into the dark and mysteriousnooks of the valleys and grand forests of the Hymavat! \" (Agroushada Parikshai.) The fakirs, when belonging to some particular temple, never act but underorders. Not one of them, unless he has reached a degree of extraordinarysanctity, is freed from the influence and guidance of his guru, his teacher, whofirst initiated and instructed him in the mysteries of the occult sciences. Likethe subject of the European mesmerizer, the average fakir can never rid himselfentirely of the psychological influence exercised on him by his guru. Havingpassed two or three hours in the silence and solitude of the inner temple inprayer and meditation, the fakir, when he emerges thence, is mesmericallystrengthened and prepared; he produces wonders far more varied and powerful thanbefore he entered. The \"master\" has laid his hands upon him, and the fakir feelsstrong. It may be shown, on the authority of many Brahmanical and Buddhist sacred books,that there has ever existed a great difference between adepts of the higherorder, and purely psychological subjects--like many of these fakirs, who aremediums in a certain qualified sense. True, the fakir is ever talking of Pitris,and this is natural; for they are his protecting deities. But are the Pitrisdisembodied human beings of our race? This is the question, and we will discussit in a moment. We say that the fakir may be regarded in a degree as a medium; for he is--whatis not generally known--under the direct mesmeric influence of a living adept,his sannyasi or guru. When the latter dies, the power of the former, unless hehas received the last transfer of spiritual forces, wanes and often evendisappears. Why, if it were otherwise, should the fakirs have been excluded fromthe right of advancing to the second and third degree? The lives of many of themexemplify a degree of self-sacrifice and sanctity unknown and utterlyincomprehensible to Europeans, who shudder at the bare thought of suchself-inflicted tortures. But however shielded from control by vulgar andearth-bound spirits, however wide the chasm between a debasing influence andtheir self-controlled souls; and however well protected by the seven-knottedmagical bamboo rod which he receives from the guru, still the fakir lives in theouter world of sin and matter, and it is possible that his soul may be tainted,perchance, by the magnetic emanations from profane objects and persons, andthereby open an access to strange spirits and gods. To admit one so situated,one not under any and all circumstances sure of the mastery over himself, to aknowledge of the awful mysteries and priceless secrets of initiation, would beimpracticable. It would not only imperil the security of that which must, at allhazards, be guarded from profanation, but it would be consenting to admit behindthe veil a fellow being, whose mediumistic irresponsibility might at any momentcause him to lose his life through an involuntary indiscretion. The same lawwhich prevailed in the Eleusinian Mysteries before our era, holds good now inIndia. Not only must the adept have mastery over himself, but he must be able tocontrol the inferior grades of spiritual beings, nature-spirits, and earthboundsouls, in short the very ones by whom, if by any, the fakir is liable to beaffected. For the objector to affirm that the Brahman-adepts and the fakirs admit that ofthemselves they are powerless, and can only act with the help of disembodiedhuman spirits, is to state that these Hindus are unacquainted with the laws oftheir sacred books and even the meaning of the word Pitris. The Laws of Manu,the Atharva-Veda, and other books, prove what we now say. \"All that exists,\"says the Atharva-Veda, \"is in the power of the gods. The gods are under thepower of magical conjurations. The magical conjurations are under the control ofthe Brahmans. Hence the gods are in the power of the Brahmans.\" This is logical,albeit seemingly paradoxical, and it is the fact. And this fact will explain tothose who have not hitherto had the clew (among whom Jacolliot must be numbered,as will appear on reading his works), why the fakir should be confined to thefirst, or lowest degree of that course of initiation whose highest adepts, orhierophants, are the sannyasis, or members of the ancient Supreme Council ofSeventy. Moreover, in Book I., of the Hindu Genesis, or Book of Creation of Manu, thePitris are called the lunar ancestors of the human race. They belong to a raceof beings different from ourselves, and cannot properly be called \"humanspirits\" in the sense in which the spiritualists use this term. This is what issaid of them: \"Then they (the gods) created the Jackshas, the Rakshasas, the Pisatshas, * theGandarbas ** and the Apsaras, and the Asuras, the Nagas, the Sarpas and theSuparnas, *** and the Pitris--lunar ancestors of the human race\" (See Institutesof Manu, Book I., sloka 37, where the Pitris are termed \"progenitors ofmankind\"). The Pitris are a distinct race of spirits belonging to the mythologicalhierarchy or rather to the kabalistical nomenclature, and must be included withthe good genii, the daemons of the Greeks, or the inferior gods of the invisibleworld; and when a fakir attributes his phenomena to the Pitris, he means onlywhat the ancient philosophers and theurgists meant when they maintained that allthe \"miracles\" were obtained through the intervention of the gods, or the goodand bad daemons, who control the powers of nature, the elementals, who aresubordinate to the power of him \"who knows.\" A ghost or human phantom would betermed by a fakir palit, or chutna, as that of a female human spirit pichhalpai,not pitris. True, pitara means (plural) fathers, ancestors; and pitra-i is akinsman; but these words are used in quite a different sense from that of thePitris invoked in the mantras. To maintain before a devout Brahman or a fakir that any one can converse withthe spirits of the dead, would be to shock him with what would appear to himblasphemy. Does not the concluding verse of the Bagavat state that this supremefelicity is alone reserved to the holy sannyasis, the gurus, and yogis? \"Long before they finally rid themselves of their mortal envelopes, the soulswho have practiced only good, such as those of the sannyasis and thevanaprasthas, acquire the faculty of conversing with the souls which precededthem to the swarga.\" In this case the Pitris instead of genii are the spirits, or rather souls, ofthe departed ones. But they will freely communicate only with those whoseatmosphere is as pure as their own, and to whose prayerful kalassa (invocation)they can respond without the risk of defiling their own celestial purity. Whenthe soul of the invocator has reached the Sayadyam, or perfect identity ofessence with the Universal Soul, when matter is utterly conquered, then theadept can freely enter into daily and hourly communion with those who, thoughunburdened with their corporeal forms, are still themselves progressing throughthe endless series of transformations included in the gradual approach to theParamatma, or the grand Universal Soul. Bearing in mind that the Christian fathers have always claimed for themselvesand their saints the name of \"friends of God,\" and knowing that they borrowedthis expression, with many others, from the technology of the Pagan temples, itis but natural to expect them to show an evil temper whenever alluding to theserites. Ignorant, as a rule, and having had biographers as ignorant asthemselves, we could not well expect them to find in the accounts of theirbeatific visions a descriptive beauty such as we find in the Pagan classics.Whether the visions and objective phenomena claimed by both the fathers of thedesert and the hierophants of the sanctuary are to be discredited, or acceptedas facts, the splendid imagery employed by Proclus and Apuleius in narrating thesmall portion of the final initiation that they dared reveal, throws completelyinto the shade the plagiaristic tales of the Christian ascetics, faithful copiesthough they were intended to be. The story of the temptation of St. Anthony inthe desert by the female demon, is a parody upon the preliminary trials of theneophyte during the Mikra, or minor Mysteries of Agrae--those rites at thethought of which Clemens railed so bitterly, and which represented the bereavedDemeter in search of her child, and her good-natured hostess Baubo. * Without entering again into a demonstration that in Christian, and especiallyIrish Roman Catholic, churches ** the same apparently indecent customs as theabove prevailed until the end of the last century, we will recur to the untiringlabors of that honest and brave defender of the ancient faith, Thomas Taylor,and his works. However much dogmatic Greek scholarship may have found to sayagainst his \"mistranslations,\" his memory must be dear to every true Platonist,who seeks rather to learn the inner thought of the great philosopher than enjoythe mere external mechanism of his writings. Better classical translators mayhave rendered us, in more correct phraseology, Plato's words, but Taylor showsus Plato's meaning, and this is more than can be said of Zeller, Jowett, andtheir predecessors. Yet, as writes Professor A. Wilder, \"Taylor's works have metwith favor at the hands of men capable of profound and recondite thinking; andit must be conceded that he was endowed with a superior qualification--that ofan intuitive perception of the interior meaning of the subjects which heconsidered. Others may have known more Greek, but he knew more Plato.\" * Taylor devoted his whole useful life to the search after such old manuscripts aswould enable him to have his own speculations concerning several obscure ritesin the Mysteries corroborated by writers who had been initiated themselves. Itis with full confidence in the assertions of various classical writers that wesay that ridiculous, perhaps licentious in some cases, as may appear ancientworship to the modern critic, it ought not to have so appeared to theChristians. During the mediaeval ages, and even later, they accepted prettynearly the same without understanding the secret import of its rites, and quitesatisfied with the obscure and rather fantastic interpretations of their clergy,who accepted the exterior form and distorted the inner meaning. We are ready toconcede, in full justice, that centuries have passed since the great majority ofthe Christian clergy, who are not allowed to pry into God's mysteries nor seekto explain that which the Church has once accepted and established, have had theremotest idea of their symbolism, whether in its exoteric or esoteric meaning.Not so with the head of the Church and its highest dignitaries. And if we fullyagree with Inman that it is \"difficult to believe that the ecclesiastics whosanctioned the publication of such prints ** could have been as ignorant asmodern ritualists,\" we are not at all prepared to believe with the same author\"that the latter, if they knew the real meaning of the symbols commonly used bythe Roman Church, would not have adopted them.\" To eliminate what is plainly derived from the sex and nature worship of theancient heathens, would be equivalent to pulling down the whole Roman Catholicimage-worship--the Madonna element--and reforming the faith to Protestantism.The enforcement of the late dogma of the Immaculation was prompted by this verysecret reason. The science of symbology was making too rapid progress. Blindfaith in the Pope's infallibility and in the immaculate nature of the Virgin andof her ancestral female lineage to a certain remove could alone save the Churchfrom the indiscreet revelations of science. It was a clever stroke of policy onthe part of the vicegerent of God. What matters it if, by \"conferring upon hersuch an honor,\" as Don Pascale de Franciscis naively expresses it, he has made agoddess of the Virgin Mary, an Olympian Deity, who, having been by her verynature placed in the impossibility of sinning, can claim no virtue, no personalmerit for her purity, precisely for which, as we were taught to believe in ouryounger days, she was chosen among all other women. If his Holiness has deprivedher of this, perhaps, on the other hand, he thinks that he has endowed her withat least one physical attribute not shared by the other virgin-goddesses. Buteven this new dogma, which, in company with the new claim to infallibility, hasquasi-revolutionized the Christian world, is not original with the Church ofRome. It is but a return to a hardly-remembered heresy of the early Christianages, that of the Collyridians, so called from their sacrificing cakes to theVirgin, whom they claimed to be Virgin-born. * The new sentence, \"O, VirginMary, conceived without sin,\" is simply a tardy acceptance of that which was atfirst deemed a \"blasphemous heresie\" by the orthodox fathers. To think for one moment that any of the popes, cardinals, or other highdignitaries \"were not aware\" from the first to the last of the external meaningsof their symbols, is to do injustice to their great learning and their spirit ofMachiavellism. It is to forget that the emissaries of Rome will never be stoppedby any difficulty which can be skirted by the employment of Jesuitical artifice.The policy of complaisant conformity was never carried to greater lengths thanby the missionaries in Ceylon, who, according to the Abbe Dubois--certainly alearned and competent authority--\"conducted the images of the Virgin and Saviouron triumphal cars, imitated from the orgies of Juggernauth, and introduced thedancers from the Brahminical rites into the ceremonial of the church.\" ** Let usat least thank these black-frocked politicians for their consistency inemploying the car of Juggernauth, upon which the \"wicked heathen\" convey thelingham of Siva. To have used this car to carry in its turn the Romishrepresentative of the female principle in nature, is to show discrimination anda thorough knowledge of the oldest mythological conceptions. They have blendedthe two deities, and thus represented, in a Christian procession, the \"heathen\"Brahma, or Nara (the father), Nari (the mother), and Viradj (the son). Says Manu: \"The Sovereign Master who exists through himself, divides his bodyinto two halves, male and female, and from the union of these two principles isborn Viradj, the Son.\" * There was not a Christian Father who could have been ignorant of these symbolsin their physical meaning; for it is in this latter aspect that they wereabandoned to the ignorant rabble. Moreover, they all had as good reasons tosuspect the occult symbolism contained in these images; although as none ofthem--Paul excepted, perhaps--had been initiated they could know nothingwhatever about the nature of the final rites. Any person revealing thesemysteries was put to death, regardless of sex, nationality, or creed. AChristian father would no more be proof against an accident than a Pagan Mystaor the Μυστες. If during the Aporreta or preliminary arcanes, there were some practices whichmight have shocked the pudicity of a Christian convert--though we doubt thesincerity of such statements--their mystical symbolism was all sufficient torelieve the performance of any charge of licentiousness. Even the episode of theMatron Baubo--whose rather eccentric method of consolation was immortalized inthe minor Mysteries--is explained by impartial mystagogues quite naturally.Ceres-Demeter and her earthly wanderings in search of her daughter are theeuhemerized descriptions of one of the most metaphysico-psychological subjectsever treated of by human mind. It is a mask for the transcendent narrative ofthe initiated seers; the celestial vision of the freed soul of the initiate ofthe last hour describing the process by which the soul that has not yet beenincarnated descends for the first time into matter, \"Blessed is he who hath seenthose common concerns of the underworld; he knows both the end of life and itsdivine origin from Jupiter,\" says Pindar. Taylor shows, on the authority of morethan one initiate, that the \"dramatic performances of the Lesser Mysteries weredesigned by their founders, to signify occultly the condition of the unpurifiedsoul invested with an earthly body, and enveloped in a material and physicalnature . . . that the soul, indeed, till purified by philosophy, suffers deaththrough its union with the body.\" The body is the sepulchre, the prison of the soul, and many Christian Fathersheld with Plato that the soul is punished through its union with the body. Suchis the fundamental doctrine of the Buddhists and of many Brahmanists too. WhenPlotinus remarks that \"when the soul has descended into generation (from itshalf-divine condition) she partakes of evil, and is carried a great way into astate the opposite of her first purity and integrity, to be entirely merged inwhich is nothing more than to fall into dark mire\"; * he only repeats theteachings of Gautama-Buddha. If we have to believe the ancient initiates at all,we must accept their interpretation of the symbols. And if, moreover, we findthem perfectly coinciding with the teachings of the greatest philosophers andthat which we know symbolizes the same meaning in the modern Mysteries in theEast, we must believe them to be right. If Demeter was considered the intellectual soul, or rather the Astral soul, halfemanation from the spirit and half tainted with matter through a succession ofspiritual evolutions--we may readily understand what is meant by the MatronBaubo, the Enchantress, who before she succeeds in reconciling thesoul--Demeter, to its new position, finds herself obliged to assume the sexualforms of an infant. Baubo is matter, the physical body; and the intellectual, asyet pure astral soul can be ensnared into its new terrestrial prison but by thedisplay of innocent babyhood. Until then, doomed to her fate, Demeter, orMagna-mater, the Soul, wonders and hesitates and suffers; but once havingpartaken of the magic potion prepared by Baubo, she forgets her sorrows; for acertain time she parts with that consciousness of higher intellect that she waspossessed of before entering the body of a child. Thenceforth she must seek torejoin it again; and when the age of reason arrives for the child, thestruggle--forgotten for a few years of infancy--begins again. The astral soul isplaced between matter (body) and the highest intellect (its immortal spirit ornous). Which of those two will conquer? The result of the battle of life liesbetween the triad. It is a question of a few years of physical enjoyment onearth and--if it has begotten abuse--of the dissolution of the earthly bodybeing followed by death of the astral body, which thus is prevented from beingunited with the highest spirit of the triad, which alone confers on usindividual immortality; or, on the other hand, of becoming immortal mystae;initiated before death of the body into the divine truths of the after life.Demi-gods below, and GODS above. Such was the chief object of the Mysteries represented as diabolical bytheology, and ridiculed by modern symbologists. To disbelieve that there existin man certain arcane powers, which, by psychological study he can develop inhimself to the highest degree, become an hierophant and then impart to othersunder the same conditions of earthly discipline, is to cast an imputation offalsehood and lunacy upon a number of the best, purest, and most learned men ofantiquity and of the middle ages. What the hierophant was allowed to see at thelast hour is hardly hinted at by them. And yet Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus,Iamblichus, Proclus, and many others knew and affirmed their reality. Whether in the \"inner temple,\" or through the study of theurgy carried onprivately, or by the sole exertion of a whole life of spiritual labor, they allobtained the practical proof of such divine possibilities for man fighting hisbattle with life on earth to win a life in the eternity. What the last epopteiawas is alluded to by Plato in Phaedrus (64); \". . . being initiated in thoseMysteries, which it is lawful to call the most blessed of all mysteries . . . wewere freed from the molestations of evils which otherwise await us in a futureperiod of time. Likewise, in consequence of this divine initiation, we becamespectators of entire, simple, immovable, and blessed visions, resident in a purelight.\" This sentence shows that they saw visions, gods, spirits. As Taylorcorrectly observes, from all such passages in the works of the initiates it maybe inferred, \"that the most sublime part of the epopteia . . . consisted inbeholding the gods themselves invested with a resplendent light,\" or highestplanetary spirits. The statement of Proclus upon this subject is unequivocal:\"In all the initiations and mysteries, the gods exhibit many forms ofthemselves, and appear in a variety of shapes, and sometimes, indeed, a formlesslight of themselves is held forth to the view; sometimes this light is accordingto a human form, and sometimes it proceeds into a different shape.\" * \"Whatever is on earth is the resemblance and SHADOW of something that is in thesphere, while that resplendent thing (the prototype of the soul-spirit)remaineth in unchangeable condition, it is well also with its shadow. But whenthe resplendent one removeth far from its shadow life removeth from the latterto a distance. And yet, that very light is the shadow of something still moreresplendent than itself.\" Thus speaks Desatir, the Persian Book of Shet, **thereby showing its identity of esoteric doctrines with those of the Greekphilosophers. The second statement of Plato confirms our belief that the Mysteries of theancients were identical with the Initiations, as practiced now among theBuddhists and the Hindu adepts. The highest visions, the most truthful, areproduced, not through natural ecstatics or \"mediums,\" as it is sometimeserroneously asserted, but through a regular discipline of gradual initiationsand development of psychical powers. The Mystae were brought into close unionwith those whom Proclus calls \"mystical natures,\" \"resplendent gods,\" because,as Plato says, \"we were ourselves pure and immaculate, being liberated from thissurrounding vestment, which we denominate body, and to which we are now boundlike an oyster to its shell.\" * So the doctrine of planetary and terrestrial Pitris was revealed entirely inancient India, as well as now, only at the last moment of initiation, and to theadepts of superior degrees. Many are the fakirs, who, though pure, and honest,and self-devoted, have yet never seen the astral form of a purely human pitar(an ancestor or father), otherwise than at the solemn moment of their first andlast initiation. It is in the presence of his instructor, the guru, and justbefore the vatou-fakir is dispatched into the world of the living, with hisseven-knotted bamboo wand for all protection, that he is suddenly placed face toface with the unknown PRESENCE. He sees it, and falls prostrate at the feet ofthe evanescent form, but is not entrusted with the great secret of itsevocation; for it is the supreme mystery of the holy syllable. The AUM containsthe evocation of the Vedic triad, the Trimurti Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, say theOrientalists; ** it contains the evocation of something more real and objectivethan this triune abstraction--we say, respectfully contradicting the eminentscientists. It is the trinity of man himself, on his way to become immortalthrough the solemn union of his inner triune SELF--the exterior, gross body, thehusk not even being taken in consideration in this human trinity. *** It is,when this trinity, in anticipation of the final triumphant reunion beyond thegates of corporeal death became for a few seconds a UNITY, that the candidate isallowed, at the moment of the initiation, to behold his future self. Thus weread in the Persian Desatir, of the \"Resplendent one\"; in the Greekphilosopher-initiates, of the Augoeides--the self-shining \"blessed visionresident in the pure light\"; in Porphyry, that Plotinus was united to his \"god\"six times during his lifetime; and so on. \"In ancient India, the mystery of the triad, known but to the initiates, couldnot, under the penalty of death, be revealed to the vulgar,\" says Vrihaspati. Neither could it in the ancient Grecian and Samothracian Mysteries. Nor can itbe now. It is in the hands of the adepts, and must remain a mystery to the worldso long as the materialistic savant regards it as an undemonstrated fallacy, aninsane hallucination, and the dogmatic theologian, a snare of the Evil One. Subjective communication with the human, god-like spirits of those who havepreceded us to the silent land of bliss, is in India divided into threecategories. Under the spiritual training of a guru or sannyasi, the vatou(disciple or neophyte) begins to feel them. Were he not under the immediateguidance of an adept, he would be controlled by the invisibles, and utterly attheir mercy, for among these subjective influences he is unable to discern thegood from the bad. Happy the sensitive who is sure of the purity of hisspiritual atmosphere! To this subjective consciousness, which is the first degree, is, after a time,added that of clairaudience. This is the second degree or stage of development.The sensitive--when not naturally made so by psychological training--now audiblyhears, but is still unable to discern; and is incapable of verifying hisimpressions, and one who is unprotected the tricky powers of the air but toooften delude with semblances of voices and speech. But the guru's influence isthere; it is the most powerful shield against the intrusion of the bhutna intothe atmosphere of the vatou, consecrated to the pure, human, and celestialPitris. The third degree is that when the fakir or any other candidate both feels,hears, and sees; and when he can at will produce the reflections of the Pitrison the mirror of astral light. All depends upon his psychological and mesmericpowers, which are always proportionate to the intensity of his will. But thefakir will never control the Akasa, the spiritual life-principle, the omnipotentagent of every phenomenon, in the same degree as an adept of the third andhighest initiation. And the phenomena produced by the will of the latter do notgenerally run the market-places for the satisfaction of open-mouthedinvestigators. The unity of God, the immortality of the spirit, belief in salvation onlythrough our works, merit and demerit; such are the principal articles of faithof the Wisdom-religion, and the ground-work of Vedaism, Buddhism, Parsism, andsuch we find to have been even that of the ancient Osirism, when we, afterabandoning the popular sun-god to the materialism of the rabble, confine ourattention to the Books of Hermes, the thrice-great. \"The THOUGHT concealed as yet the world in silence and darkness. . . . Then theLord who exists through Himself, and who is not to be divulged to the externalsenses of man; dissipated darkness, and manifested the perceptible world.\" \"He that can be perceived only by the spirit, that escapes the organs of sense,who is without visible parts, eternal, the soul of all beings, that none cancomprehend, displayed His own splendor\" (Manu, book i., slokas, 6-7). Such is the ideal of the Supreme in the mind of every Hindu philosopher. \"Of all the duties, the principal one is to acquire the knowledge of the supremesoul (the spirit); it is the first of all sciences, for it alone confers on manimmortality\" (Manu, book xii., sloka 85). And our scientists talk of the Nirvana of Buddha and the Moksha of Brahma as ofa complete annihilation! It is thus that the following verse is interpreted bysome materialists. \"The man who recognizes the Supreme Soul, in his own soul, as well as in that ofall creatures, and who is equally just to all (whether man or animals) obtainsthe happiest of all fates, that to be finally absorbed in the bosom of Brahma\"(Manu, book xii., sloka 125). The doctrine of the Moksha and the Nirvana, as understood by the school of MaxMuller, can never bear confronting with numerous texts that can be found, ifrequired, as a final refutation. There are sculptures in many pagodas whichcontradict, point-blank, the imputation. Ask a Brahman to explain Moksha,address yourself to an educated Buddhist and pray him to define for you themeaning of Nirvana. Both will answer you that in every one of these religionsNirvana represents the dogma of the spirit's immortality. That, to reach theNirvana means absorption into the great universal soul, the latter representinga state, not an individual being or an anthropomorphic god, as some understandthe great EXISTENCE. That a spirit reaching such a state becomes a part of theintegral whole, but never loses its individuality for all that. Henceforth, thespirit lives spiritually, without any fear of further modifications of form; forform pertains to matter, and the state of Nirvana implies a completepurification or a final riddance from even the most sublimated particle ofmatter. This word, absorbed, when it is proved that the Hindus and Buddhists believe inthe immortality of the spirit, must necessarily mean intimate union, notannihilation. Let Christians call them idolaters, if they still dare do so, inthe face of science and the latest translations of the sacred Sanscrit books;they have no right to present the speculative philosophy of ancient sages as aninconsistency and the philosophers themselves as illogical fools. With farbetter reason we can accuse the ancient Jews of utter nihilism. There is not aword contained in the Books of Moses--or the prophets either--which, takenliterally, implies the spirit's immortality. Yet every devout Jew hopes as wellto be \"gathered into the bosom of A-Braham.\" The hierophants and some Brahmans are accused of having administered to theirepoptai strong drinks or anaesthetics to produce visions which shall be taken bythe latter as realities. They did and do use sacred beverages which, like theSoma-drink, possess the faculty of freeing the astral form from the bonds ofmatter; but in those visions there is as little to be attributed tohallucination as in the glimpses which the scientist, by the help of his opticalinstrument, gets into the microscopic world. A man cannot perceive, touch, andconverse with pure spirit through any of his bodily senses. Only spirit alonecan talk to and see spirit; and even our astral soul, the Doppelganger, is toogross, too much tainted yet with earthly matter to trust entirely to itsperceptions and insinuations. How dangerous may often become untrained mediumship, and how thoroughly it wasunderstood and provided against by the ancient sages, is perfectly exemplifiedin the case of Socrates. The old Grecian philosopher was a \"medium\"; hence, hehad never been initiated into the Mysteries; for such was the rigorous law. Buthe had his \"familiar spirit\" as they call it, his daimonion; and this invisiblecounsellor became the cause of his death. It is generally believed that if hewas not initiated into the Mysteries it was because he himself neglected tobecome so. But the Secret Records teach us that it was because he could not beadmitted to participate in the sacred rites, and precisely, as we state, onaccount of his mediumship. There was a law against the admission not only ofsuch as were convicted of deliberate witchcraft * but even but even of those whowere known to have \"a familiar spirit.\" The law was just and logical, because agenuine medium is more or less irresponsible; and the eccentricities of Socratesare thus accounted for in some degree. A medium must be passive; and if a firmbeliever in his \"spirit-guide\" he will allow himself to be ruled by the latter,not by the rules of the sanctuary. A medium of olden times, like the modern\"medium\" was subject to be entranced at the will and pleasure of the \"power\"which controlled him; therefore, he could not well have been entrusted with theawful secrets of the final initiation, \"never to be revealed under the penaltyof death.\" The old sage, in unguarded moments of \"spiritual inspiration,\"revealed that which he had never learned; and was therefore put to death as anatheist. How then, with such an instance as that of Socrates, in relation to the visionsand spiritual wonders at the epoptai, of the Inner Temple, can any one assertthat these seers, theurgists, and thaumaturgists were all \"spirit-mediums\"?Neither Pythagoras, Plato, nor any of the later more important Neo-platonists;neither Iamblichus, Longinus, Proclus, nor Apollonius of Tyana, were evermediums; for in such case they would not have been admitted to the Mysteries atall. As Taylor proves--\"This assertion of divine visions in the Mysteries isclearly confirmed by Plotinus. And in short, that magical evocation formed apart of the sacerdotal office in them, and that this was universally believed byall antiquity long before the era of the later Platonists,\" shows that apartfrom natural \"mediumship,\" there has existed, from the beginning of time, amysterious science, discussed by many, but known only to a few. The use of it is a longing toward our only true and real home--the after-life,and a desire to cling more closely to our parent spirit; abuse of it is sorcery,witchcraft, black magic. Between the two is placed natural \"mediumship\"; a soulclothed with imperfect matter, a ready agent for either the one or the other,and utterly dependent on its surroundings of life, constitutionalheredity--physical as well as mental--and on the nature of the \"spirits\" itattracts around itself. A blessing or a curse, as fate will have it, unless themedium is purified of earthly dross. The reason why in every age so little has been generally known of the mysteriesof initiation, is twofold. The first has already been explained by more than oneauthor, and lies in the terrible penalty following the least indiscretion. Thesecond, is the superhuman difficulties and even dangers which the daringcandidate of old had to encounter, and either conquer, or die in the attempt,when, what is still worse, he did not lose his reason. There was no real dangerto him whose mind had become thoroughly spiritualized, and so prepared for everyterrific sight. He who fully recognized the power of his immortal spirit, andnever doubted for one moment its omnipotent protection, had naught to fear. Butwoe to the candidate in whom the slightest physical fear--sickly child ofmatter--made him lose sight and faith in his own invulnerability. He who was notwholly confident of his moral fitness to accept the burden of these tremendoussecrets was doomed. The Talmud gives the story of the four Tanaim, who are made, in allegoricalterms, to enter into the garden of delights; i.e., to be initiated into theoccult and final science. \"According to the teaching of our holy masters the names of the four who enteredthe garden of delight, are: Ben Asai, Ben Zoma, Acher, and Rabbi Akiba. . . . \"Ben Asai looked and--lost his sight. \"Ben Zoma looked and--lost his reason. \"Acher made depredations in the plantation\" (mixed up the whole and failed).\"But Akiba, who had entered in peace, came out of it in peace, for the saintwhose name be blessed had said, 'This old man is worthy of serving us withglory.' \" \"The learned commentators of the Talmud, the Rabbis of the synagogue, explainthat the garden of delight, in which those four personages are made to enter, isbut that mysterious science, the most terrible of sciences for weak intellects,which it leads directly to insanity,\" says A. Franck, in his Kabbala. It is notthe pure at heart and he who studies but with a view to perfecting himself andso more easily acquiring the promised immortality, who need have any fear; butrather he who makes of the science of sciences a sinful pretext for worldlymotives, who should tremble. The latter will never withstand the kabalisticevocations of the supreme initiation. The licentious performances of the thousand and one early Christian sects, maybe criticised by partial commentators as well as the ancient Eleusinian andother rites. But why should they incur the blame of the theologians, theChristians, when their own \"Mysteries\" of \"the divine incarnation with Joseph,Mary, and the angel\" in a sacred trilogue used to be enacted in more than onecountry, and were famous at one time in Spain and Southern France? Later, theyfell like many other once secret rites into the hands of the populace. It is buta few years since, during every Christmas week, Punch-and-Judy-boxes, containingthe above named personages, an additional display of the infant Jesus in hismanger, were carried about the country in Poland and Southern Russia. They werecalled Kaliadovki, a word the correct etymology of which we are unable to giveunless it is from the verb Kaliadovat, a word that we as willingly abandon tolearned philologists. We have seen this show in our days of childhood. Weremember the three king-Magi represented by three dolls in powdered wigs andcolored tights; and it is from recollecting the simple, profound venerationdepicted on the faces of the pious audience, that we can the more readilyappreciate the honest and just remark by the editor, in the introduction to theEleusinian Mysteries, who says: \"It is ignorance which leads to profanation. Menridicule what they do not properly understand. . . . The undercurrent of thisworld is set toward one goal; and inside of human credulity--call it humanweakness, if you please--is a power almost infinite, a holy faith capable ofapprehending the supremest truths of all existence.\" If that abstract sentiment called Christian charity prevailed in the Church, wewould be well content to leave all this unsaid. We have no quarrel withChristians whose faith is sincere and whose practice coincides with theirprofession. But with an arrogant, dogmatic, and dishonest clergy, we havenothing to do except to see the ancient philosophy--antagonized by moderntheology in its puny offspring--Spiritualism--defended and righted so far as weare able, so that its grandeur and sufficiency may be thoroughly displayed. Itis not alone for the esoteric philosophy that we fight; nor for any modernsystem of moral philosophy, but for the inalienable right of private judgment,and especially for the ennobling idea of a future life of activity andaccountability. We eagerly applaud such commentators as Godfrey Higgins, Inman, Payne Knight,King, Dunlap, and Dr. Newton, however much they disagree with our own mysticalviews, for their diligence is constantly being rewarded by fresh discoveries ofthe Pagan paternity of Christian symbols. But otherwise, all these learned worksare useless. Their researches only cover half the ground. Lacking the true keyof interpretation they see the symbols only in a physical aspect. They have nopassword to cause the gates of mystery to swing open; and ancient spiritualphilosophy is to them a closed book. Diametrically opposed though they be to theclergy in their ideas respecting it, in the way of interpretation they do littlemore than their opponents for a questioning public. Their labors tend tostrengthen materialism as those of the clergy, especially the Romish clergy, doto cultivate belief in diabolism. If the study of Hermetic philosophy held out no other hope of reward, it wouldbe more than enough to know that by it we may learn with what perfection ofjustice the world is governed. A sermon upon this text is preached by every pageof history. Among all there is not one that conveys a deeper moral than the caseof the Roman Church. The divine law of compensation was never more strikinglyexemplified than in the fact that by her own act she has deprived herself of theonly possible key to her own religious mysteries. The assumption of GodfreyHiggins that there are two doctrines maintained in the Roman Church, one for themasses and the other--the esoteric--for the \"perfect,\" or the initiates, as inthe ancient Mysteries, appears to us unwarranted and rather fantastic. They havelost the key, we repeat; otherwise no terrestrial power could have prostratedher, and except a superficial knowledge of the means of producing \"miracles,\"her clergy can in no way be compared in their wisdom with the hierophants ofold. In burning the works of the theurgists; in proscribing those who affect theirstudy; in affixing the stigma of demonolatry to magic in general, Rome has lefther exoteric worship and Bible to be helplessly riddled by every free-thinker,her sexual emblems to be identified with coarseness, and her priests tounwittingly turn magicians and even sorcerers in their exorcisms, which are butnecromantic evocations. Thus retribution, by the exquisite adjustment of divinelaw, is made to overtake this scheme of cruelty, injustice, and bigotry, throughher own suicidal acts. True philosophy and divine truth are convertible terms. A religion which dreadsthe light cannot be a religion based on either truth or philosophy--hence, itmust be false. The ancient Mysteries were mysteries to the profane only, whomthe hierophant never sought nor would accept as proselytes; to the initiates theMysteries became explained as soon as the final veil was withdrawn. No mind likethat of Pythagoras or Plato would have contented itself with an unfathomable andincomprehensible mystery, like that of the Christian dogma. There can be but onetruth, for two small truths on the same subject can but constitute one greaterror. Among thousands of exoteric or popular conflicting religions which havebeen propagated since the days when the first men were enabled to interchangetheir ideas, not a nation, not a people, nor the most abject tribe, but aftertheir own fashion has believed in an Unseen God, the First Cause of unerring andimmutable laws, and in the immortality of our spirit. No creed, no falsephilosophy, no religious exaggerations, could ever destroy that feeling. Itmust, therefore, be based upon an absolute truth. On the other hand, every oneof the numberless religions and religious sects views the Deity after its ownfashion; and, fathering on the unknown its own speculations, it enforces thesepurely human outgrowths of overheated imagination on the ignorant masses, andcalls them \"revelation.\" As the dogmas of every religion and sect often differradically, they cannot be true. And if untrue, what are they? \"The greatest curse to a nation,\" remarks Dr. Inman, \"is not a bad religion, buta form of faith which prevents manly inquiry. I know of no nation of old thatwas priest-ridden which did not fall under the swords of those who did not carefor hierarchs. . . . The greatest danger is to be feared from thoseecclesiastics who wink at vice, and encourage it as a means whereby they cangain power over their votaries. So long as every man does to other men as hewould that they should do to him, and allows no one to interfere between him andhis Maker, all will go well with the world.\" * [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES55:* \"La Demonomanie, ou traite des Sorciers.\" Paris, 1587. 61:* Dr. W.

Within the little enclosure or sanctuary, separated from the crowd bya light railing, lay, on a common bench, with a little pillow for her head torecline upon, a poorly-clad girl, probably of the peasant or artisan class; herbrother or husband stood at her feet to restrain her (at times) frantic kickingby holding her legs. The door of the vestry opened; the exhibitor--I mean thepriest--came in. The poor girl, not without just reason, 'had an aversion toholy things,' or, at least, the 400 devils within her distorted body had such anaversion, and in the confusion of the moment, thinking that the father was 'aholy thing,' she doubled up her legs, screamed out with twitching mouth, herwhole body writhing, and threw herself nearly off the bench. The male attendantseized her legs, the women supported her head and swept out her dishevelledhair. The priest advanced and, mingling familiarly with the shuddering andhorror-struck crowd, said, pointing at the suffering child, now sobbing andtwitching on the bench, 'Promise me, my children, that you will be prudent(prudentes), and of a truth, sons and daughters mine, you shall see marvels.'The promise was given. The exhibitor went to procure stole and short surplice(estola y roquete), and returned in a moment, taking his stand at the side ofthe 'possessed with the devils,' with his face toward the group of students. Theorder of the day's proceedings was a lecture to the bystanders, and theoperation of exorcising the devils. 'You know,' said the priest, 'that so greatis this girl's aversion to holy things, myself included, that she goes intoconvulsions, kicks, screams, and distorts her body the moment she arrives at thecorner of this street, and her convulsive struggles reach their climax when sheenters the sacred house of the Most High.' Turning to the prostrate, shuddering,most unhappy object of his attack, the priest commenced: 'In the name of p. 69God, of the saints, of the blessed Host, of every holy sacrament of our Church,I adjure thee, Rusbel, come out of her.' (N. B. 'Rusbel' is the name of a devil,the devil having 257 names in Catalonia.) Thus adjured, the girl threwherself--in an agony of convulsion, till her distorted face, foam-bespatteredlips and writhing limbs grew well-nigh stiff--at full length upon the floor,and, in language semi-obscene, semi-violent, screamed out, 'I don't choose tocome out, you thieves, scamps, robbers.' At last, from the quivering lips of thegirl, came the words, 'I will'; but the devil added, with traditionalperversity, 'I will cast the 100 out, but by the mouth of the girl.' The priestobjected. The exit, he said, of 100 devils out of the small Spanish mouth of thewoman would 'leave her suffocated.' Then the maddened girl said she must undressherself for the devils to escape. This petition the holy father refused. 'Then Iwill come out through the right foot, but first'--the girl had on a hempensandal, she was obviously of the poorest class--'you must take off her sandal.'The sandal was untied; the foot gave a convulsive plunge; the devil and hismyrmidons (so the cura said, looking round triumphantly) had gone to their ownplace. And, assured of this, the wretched dupe of a girl lay quite still. Thebishop was not cognizant of this freak of the clergy, and the moment it came tothe ears of the civil authorities, the sharpest means were taken to prevent arepetition of the scandal.\" 70:* Louis Jacolliot: \"Le Spiritisme dans le Monde,\" p. 162. 70:** St. Augustine: \"City of God.\" 70:*** \"Moeurs et Pratiques des Demons,\" p. ii. 71:* Des Mousseaux: \"Table des Matieres.\" 71:** \"Demonologia\"; London, 1827, J.

If thesemust be called heresies, then early Christianity itself must be included in thenumber. Basilides and Valentinus preceded Irenaeus and Tertullian; and the twolatter Fathers had less facts than the two former Gnostics to show that theirheresy was plausible. Neither divine right nor truth brought about the triumphof their Christianity; fate alone was propitious. We can assert, with entireplausibility, that there is not one of all these sects--Kabalism, Judaism, andour present Christianity included--but sprung from the two main branches of thatone mother-trunk, the once universal religion, which antedated the Vedaicages--we speak of that prehistoric Buddhism which merged later into Brahmanism. The religion which the primitive teaching of the early few apostles mostresembled--a religion preached by Jesus himself--is the elder of these two,Buddhism. The latter as taught in its primitive purity, and carried toperfection by the last of the Buddhas, Gautama, based its moral ethics on threefundamental principles. It alleged that 1, every thing existing, exists fromnatural causes; 2, that virtue brings its own reward, and vice and sin their ownpunishment; and, 3, that the state of man in this world is probationary. Wemight add that on these three principles rested the universal foundation ofevery religious creed; God, and individual immortality for every man--if hecould but win it. However puzzling the subsequent theological tenets; howeverseemingly incomprehensible the metaphysical abstractions which have convulsedthe theology of every one of the great religions of mankind as soon as it wasplaced on a sure footing, the above is found to be the essence of everyreligious philosophy, with the exception of later Christianity. It was that ofZoroaster, of Pythagoras, of Plato, of Jesus, and even of Moses, albeit theteachings of the Jewish law-giver have been so piously tampered with. We will devote the present chapter mainly to a brief survey of the numeroussects which have recognized themselves as Christians; that is to say, that havebelieved in a Christos, or an ANOINTED ONE. We will also endeavor to explain thelatter appellation from the kabalistic stand-point, and show it reappearing inevery religious system. It might be profitable, at the same time, to see howmuch the earliest apostles--Paul and Peter, agreed in their preaching of the newDispensation. We will begin with Peter. We must once more return to that greatest of all the Patristic frauds; the onewhich has undeniably helped the Roman Catholic Church to its unmeritedsupremacy, viz.: the barefaced assertion, in the teeth of historical evidence,that Peter suffered martyrdom at Rome. It is but too natural that the Latinclergy should cling to it, for, with the exposure of the fraudulent nature ofthis pretext, the dogma of apostolic succession must fall to the ground. There have been many able works of late, in refutation of this preposterousclaim. Among others we note Mr. G. Reber's, The Christ of Paul, which overthrowsit quite ingeniously. The author proves, 1, that there was no church establishedat Rome, until the reign of Antoninus Pius; 2, that as Eusebius and Irenaeusboth agree that Linus was the second Bishop of Rome, into whose hands \"theblessed apostles\" Peter and Paul committed the church after building it, itcould not have been at any other time than between A.D. 64 and 68; 3, that thisinterval of years happens during the reign of Nero, for Eusebius states thatLinus held this office twelve years (Ecclesiastical History, book iii., c. 13),entering upon it A.D. 69, one year after the death of Nero, and dying himself in81. After that the author maintains, on very solid grounds, that Peter could notbe in Rome A.D. 64, for he was then in Babylon; wherefrom he wrote his firstEpistle, the date of which is fixed by Dr. Lardner and other critics atprecisely this year. But we believe that his best argument is in proving that itwas not in the character of the cowardly Peter to risk himself in such closeneighborhood with Nero, who \"was feeding the wild beasts of the Amphitheatrewith the flesh and bones of Christians\" * at that time. Perhaps the Church of Rome was but consistent in choosing as her titular founderthe apostle who thrice denied his master at the moment of danger; and the onlyone, moreover, except Judas, who provoked Christ in such a way as to beaddressed as the \"Enemy.\" \"Get thee behind me, SATAN!\" exclaims Jesus, rebukingthe taunting apostle. ** There is a tradition in the Greek Church which has never found favor at theVatican. The former traces its origin to one of the Gnostic leaders--Basilides,perhaps, who lived under Trajan and Adrian, at the end of the first and thebeginning of the second century. With regard to this particular tradition, ifthe Gnostic is Basilides, then he must be accepted as a sufficient authority,having claimed to have been a disciple of the Apostle Matthew, and to have hadfor master Glaucias, a disciple of St. Peter himself. Were the narrativeattributed to him authenticated, the London Committee for the Revision of theBible would have to add a new verse to Matthew, Mark, and John, who tell thestory of Peter's denial of Christ. This tradition, then, of which we have been speaking, affirms that, whenfrightened at the accusation of the servant of the high priest, the apostle hadthrice denied his master, and the cock had crowed, Jesus, who was then passingthrough the hall in custody of the soldiers, turned, and, looking at Peter,said: \"Verily, I say unto thee, Peter, thou shalt deny me throughout the comingages, and never stop until thou shalt be old, and shalt stretch forth thy hands,and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldst not.\" The latterpart of this sentence, say the Greeks, relates to the Church of Rome, andprophesies her constant apostasy from Christ, under the mask of false religion.Later, it was inserted in the twenty-first chapter of John, but the whole ofthis chapter had been pronounced a forgery, even before it was found that thisGospel was never written by John the Apostle at all. The anonymous author of Supernatural Religion, a work which in two years passedthrough several editions, and which is alleged to have been written by aneminent theologian, proves conclusively the spuriousness of the four gospels, orat least their complete transformation in the hands of the too-zealous Irenaeusand his champions. The fourth gospel is completely upset by this able author;the extraordinary forgeries of the Fathers of the early centuries are plainlydemonstrated, and the relative value of the synoptics is discussed with anunprecedented power of logic. The work carries conviction in its every line.From it we quote the following: \"We gain infinitely more than we lose inabandoning belief in the reality of Divine Revelation. Whilst we retain, pureand unimpaired, the treasure of Christian morality, we relinquish nothing butthe debasing elements added to it by human superstition. We are no longer boundto believe a theology which outrages reason and moral sense. We are freed frombase anthropomorphic views of God and His government of the Universe, and fromJewish Mythology we rise to higher conceptions of an infinitely wise andbeneficent Being, hidden from our finite minds, it is true, in the impenetrableglory of Divinity, but whose laws of wondrous comprehensiveness and perfectionwe ever perceive in operation around us. . . . The argument so often employed bytheologians, that Divine revelation is necessary for man, and that certain viewscontained in that revelation are required for our moral consciousness, is purelyimaginary, and derived from the revelation which it seeks to maintain. The onlything absolutely necessary for man is TRUTH, and to that, and that alone, mustour moral consciousness adapt itself.\" * We will consider farther in what light was regarded the Divine revelation of theJewish Bible by the Gnostics, who yet believed in Christ in their own way, a farbetter and less blasphemous one than the Roman Catholic. The Fathers have forcedon the believers in Christ a Bible, the laws prescribed in which he was thefirst to break; the teachings of which he utterly rejected; and for which crimeshe was finally crucified. Of whatever else the Christian world can boast, it canhardly claim logic and consistency as its chief virtues. The fact alone that Peter remained to the last an \"apostle of the circumcision,\"speaks for itself. Whosoever else might have built the Church of Rome it was notPeter. If such were the case, the successors of this apostle would have tosubmit themselves to circumcision, if it were but for the sake of consistency,and to show that the claims of the popes are not utterly groundless, Dr. Inmanasserts that report says that \"in our Christian times popes have to be privatelyperfect,\" ** but we do not know whether it is carried to the extent of theLevitical Jewish law. The first fifteen Christian bishops of Jerusalem,commencing with James and including Judas, were all circumcised Jews. *** In the Sepher Toldos Jeshu, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_183] a Hebrew manuscript ofgreat antiquity, the version about Peter is different. Simon Peter, it says, wasone of their own brethren, though he had somewhat departed from the laws, andthe Jewish hatred and persecution of the apostle seems to have existed but inthe fecund imagination of the fathers. The author speaks of him with greatrespect and fairness, calling him \"a faithful servant of the living God,\" whopassed his life in austerity and meditation, \"living in Babylon at the summit ofa tower,\" composing hymns, and preaching charity. He adds that Peter alwaysrecommended to the Christians not to molest the Jews, but as soon as he wasdead, behold another preacher went to Rome and pretended that Simon Peter hadaltered the teachings of his master. He invented a burning hell and threatenedevery one with it; promised miracles, but worked none. How much there is in the above of fiction and how much of truth, it is forothers to decide; but it certainly bears more the evidence of sincerity and facton its face, than the fables concocted by the fathers to answer their end. We may the more readily credit this friendship between Peter and his lateco-religionists as we find in Theodoret the following assertion: \"The Nazarenesare Jews, honoring the ANOINTED (Jesus) as a just man and using the Evangelaccording to Peter.\" ** Peter was a Nazarene, according to the Talmud. Hebelonged to the sect of the later Nazarenes, which dissented from the followersof John the Baptist, and became a rival sect; and which--as tradition goes--wasinstituted by Jesus himself. History finds the first Christian sects to have been either Nazarenes like Johnthe Baptist; or Ebionites, among whom were many of the relatives of Jesus; orEssenes (Iessaens) the Therapeutae, healers, of which the Nazaria were a branch.All these sects, which only in the days of Irenaeus began to be consideredheretical, were more or less kabalistic. They believed in the expulsion ofdemons by magical incantations, and practiced this method; Jervis terms theNabatheans and other such sects \"wandering Jewish exorcists,\" *** the Arabicword Nabae, meaning to wander, and the Hebrew naba, to prophesy. The Talmudindiscriminately calls all the Christians Nozari. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_186] All the Gnostic sectsequally believed in magic. Irenaeus, in describing the followers of Basilides,says, \"They use images, invocations, incantations, and all other thingspertaining unto magic.\" Dunlap, on the authority of Lightfoot, shows that Jesuswas called Nazaraios, in reference to his humble and mean external condition;\"for Nazaraios means separation, alienation from other men.\" ** The real meaning of the word nazar [images/00029.jpg]signifies to vow orconsecrate one's self to the service of God. As a noun it is a diadem or emblemof such consecration, a head so consecrated. *** Joseph was styled a nazar. ****\"The head of Joseph, the vertex of the nazar among his brethren.\" Samson andSamuel ( [images/00030.jpg]Semes-on and Sem-va-el) are described alike asnazars. Porphyry, treating of Pythagoras, says that he was purified andinitiated at Babylon by Zar-adas, the head of the sacred college. May it not besurmised, therefore, that the Zoro-Aster was the nazar of Ishtar, Zar-adas orNa-Zar-Ad, ***** being the same with change of idiom? Ezra, or[images/00031.jpg], was a priest and scribe, a hierophant; and the first Hebrewcolonizer of Judea was [images/00032.jpg]Zeru-Babel or the Zoro or nazar ofBabylon. The Jewish Scriptures indicate two distinct worships and religions among theIsraelites; that of Bacchus-worship under the mask of Jehovah, and that of theChaldean initiates to whom belonged some of the nazars, the theurgists, and afew of the prophets. The headquarters of these were always at Babylon andChaldea, where two rival schools of Magians can be distinctly shown. Those whowould doubt the statement will have in such a case to account for thediscrepancy between history and Plato, who of all men of his day was certainlyone of the best informed. Speaking of the Magians, he shows them as instructingthe Persian kings of Zoroaster, as the son or priest of Oromasdes; and yetDarius, in the inscription at Bihistun, boasts of having restored the cultus ofOrmazd and put down the Magian rites! Evidently there were two distinct andantagonistic Magian schools. The oldest and the most esoteric of the two beingthat which, satisfied with its unassailable knowledge and secret power, wascontent to apparently relinquish her exoteric popularity, and concede hersupremacy into the hands of the reforming Darius. The later Gnostics showed thesame prudent policy by accommodating themselves in every country to theprevailing religious forms, still secretly adhering to their own essentialdoctrines. There is another hypothesis possible, which is that Zero-Ishtar was the highpriest of the Chaldean worship, or Magian hierophant. When the Aryans of Persia,under Darius Hystaspes, overthrew the Magian Gomates, and restored the Masdeanworship, there ensued an amalgamation by which the Magian Zoro-astar became theZara-tushra of the Vendidad. This was not acceptable to the other Aryans, whoadopted the Vedic religion as distinguished from that of Avesta. But this is butan hypothesis. And whatever Moses is now believed to have been, we will demonstrate that he wasan initiate. The Mosaic religion was at best a sun-and-serpent worship, diluted,perhaps, with some slight monotheistic notions before the latter were forciblycrammed into the so-called \"inspired Scriptures\" by Ezra, at the time he wasalleged to have rewritten the Mosaic books. At all events the Book of Numberswas a later book; and there the sun-and-serpent worship is as plainly traceableas in any Pagan story. The tale of the fiery serpents is an allegory in morethan one sense. The \"serpents\" were the Levites or Ophites, who were Moses'body-guard (see Exodus xxxii. 26); and the command of the \"Lord\" to Moses tohang the heads of the people \"before the Lord against the sun,\" which is theemblem of this Lord, is unequivocal. The nazars or prophets, as well as the Nazarenes, were an anti-Bacchus caste, inso far that, in common with all the initiated prophets, they held to the spiritof the symbolical religions and offered a strong opposition to the idolatrousand exoteric practices of the dead letter. Hence, the frequent stoning of theprophets by the populace and under the leadership of those priests who made aprofitable living out of the popular superstitions. Otfried Muller shows howmuch the Orphic Mysteries differed from the popular rites of Bacchus, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_191] although the Orphikoi areknown to have followed the worship of Bacchus. The system of the purest moralityand of a severe asceticism promulgated in the teachings of Orpheus, and sostrictly adhered to by his votaries, are incompatible with the lasciviousnessand gross immorality of the popular rites. The fable of Aristaeus pursuingEurydike into the woods where a serpent occasions her death, is a very plainallegory, which was in part explained at the earliest times. Aristaeus is brutalpower, pursuing Eurydike, the esoteric doctrine, into the woods where theserpent (emblem of every sun-god, and worshipped under its grosser aspect evenby the Jews) kills her; i.e., forces truth to become still more esoteric, andseek shelter in the Underworld, which is not the hell of our theologians.Moreover, the fate of Orpheus, torn to pieces by the Bacchantes, is anotherallegory to show that the gross and popular rites are always more welcome thandivine but simple truth, and proves the great difference that must have existedbetween the esoteric and the popular worship. As the poems of both Orpheus andMusaeus were said to have been lost since the earliest ages, so that neitherPlato nor Aristotle recognized anything authentic in the poems extant in theirtime, it is difficult to say with precision what constituted their peculiarrites. Still we have the oral tradition, and every inference to draw therefrom;and this tradition points to Orpheus as having brought his doctrines from India.As one whose religion was that of the oldest Magians--hence, that to whichbelonged the initiates of all countries, beginning with Moses, the \"sons of theProphets,\" and the ascetic nazars (who must not be confounded with those againstwhom thundered Hosea and other prophets) to the Essenes. This latter sect werePythagoreans before they rather degenerated, than became perfected in theirsystem by the Buddhist missionaries, whom Pliny tells us established themselveson the shores of the Dead Sea, ages before his time, \"per saeculorum millia.\"But if, on the one hand, these Buddhist monks were the first to establishmonastic communities and inculcate the strict observance of dogmatic conventualrule, on the other they were also the first to enforce and popularize thosestern virtues so exemplified by Sakya-muni, and which were previously exercisedonly in isolated cases of well-known philosophers and their followers; virtuespreached two or three centuries later by Jesus, practiced by a few Christianascetics, and gradually abandoned, and even entirely forgotten by the ChristianChurch. The initiated nazars had ever held to this rule, which had to be followed beforethem by the adepts of every age; and the disciples of John were but a dissentingbranch of the Essenes. Therefore, we cannot well confound them with all thenazars spoken of in the Old Testament, and who are accused by Hosea with havingseparated or consecrated themselves to Bosheth; which implied the greatestpossible abomination. To infer, as some critics and theologians do, that itmeans to separate one's self to chastity or continence, is either to advisedlypervert the true meaning, or to be totally ignorant of the Hebrew language. Theeleventh verse of the first chapter of Micah half explains the word in itsveiled translation: \"Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, etc.,\" and in theoriginal text the word is Bosheth. Certainly neither Baal, nor Iahoh Kadosh,with his Kadeshim, was a god of ascetic virtue, albeit the Septuaginta termsthem, as well as the galli--the perfected priests--τετελεσμενους, the initiatedand the consecrated. * The great Sod of the Kadeshim, translated in Psalm lxxxix. 7, by \"assembly ofthe saints,\" was anything but a mystery of the \"sanctified\" in the sense givento the latter word by Webster. The Nazireate sect existed long before the laws of Moses, and originated amongpeople most inimical to the \"chosen\" ones of Israel, viz., the people ofGalilee, the ancient olla-podrida of idolatrous nations, where was built Nazara,the present Nazareth. It is in Nazara that the ancient Nazoria or Nazireatesheld their \"Mysteries of Life\" or \"assemblies,\" as the word now stands in thetranslation, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_193] which werebut the secret mysteries of initiation, ** utterly distinct in their practicalform from the popular Mysteries which were held at Byblus in honor of Adonis.While the true initiates of the ostracised Galilee were worshipping the true Godand enjoying transcendent visions, what were the \"chosen\" ones about? Ezekieltells it to us (chap. viii) when, in describing what he saw, he says that theform of a hand took him by a lock of his head and transported him from Chaldeaunto Jerusalem. \"And there stood seventy men of the senators of the house ofIsrael. . . . 'Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients . . . do in thedark?' \" inquires the \"Lord.\" \"At the door of the house of the Lord . . . beholdthere sat women weeping for Tammuz\" (Adonis). We really cannot suppose that thePagans have ever surpassed the \"chosen\" people in certain shameful abominationsof which their own prophets accuse them so profusely. To admit this truth, onehardly needs even to be a Hebrew scholar; let him read the Bible in English andmeditate over the language of the \"holy\" prophets. This accounts for the hatred of the later Nazarenes for the orthodoxJews--followers of the exoteric Mosaic Law--who are ever taunted by this sectwith being the worshippers of Iurbo-Adunai, or Lord Bacchus. Passing under thedisguise of Adoni-Iachoh (original text, Isaiah lxi. 1), Iahoh and Lord Sabaoth,the Baal-Adonis, or Bacchus, worshipped in the groves and public sods orMysteries, under the polishing hand of Ezra becomes finally the later-vowelledAdonai of the Massorah--the One and Supreme God of the Christians! \"Thou shalt not worship the Sun who is named Adunai,\" says the Codex of theNazarenes; \"whose name is also Kadush *** and El-El. This Adunai will elect tohimself a nation and congregate in crowds (his worship will be exoteric) . . .Jerusalem will become the refuge and city of the Abortive, who shall perfectthemselves (circumcise) with a sword . . . and shall adore Adunai.\" **** The oldest Nazarenes, who were the descendants of the Scripture nazars, andwhose last prominent leader was John the Baptist, although never very orthodoxin the sight of the scribes and Pharisees of Jerusalem were, nevertheless,respected and left unmolested. Even Herod \"feared the multitude\" because theyregarded John as a prophet (Matthew xiv. 5). But the followers of Jesusevidently adhered to a sect which became a still more exasperating thorn intheir side. It appeared as a heresy within another heresy; for while the nazarsof the olden times, the \"Sons of the Prophets,\" were Chaldean kabalists, theadepts of the new dissenting sect showed themselves reformers and innovatorsfrom the first. The great similitude traced by some critics between the ritesand observances of the earliest Christians and those of the Essenes may beaccounted for without the slightest difficulty. The Essenes, as we remarked justnow, were the converts of Buddhist missionaries who had overrun Egypt, Greece,and even Judea at one time, since the reign of Asoka the zealous propagandist;and while it is evidently to the Essenes that belongs the honor of having hadthe Nazarene reformer, Jesus, as a pupil, still the latter is found disagreeingwith his early teachers on several questions of formal observance. He cannotstrictly be called an Essene, for reasons which we will indicate further on,neither was he a nazar, or Nazaria of the older sect. What Jesus was, may befound in the Codex Nazaraeus, in the unjust accusations of the BardesanianGnostics. \"Jesu is Nebu, the false Messiah, the destroyer of the old orthodox religion,\"says the Codex. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_197] He isthe founder of the sect of the new nazars, and, as the words clearly imply, afollower of the Buddhist doctrine. In Hebrew the word naba means to speak ofinspiration; and [images/00033.jpg]is nebo, a god of wisdom. But Nebo is alsoMercury, and Mercury is Buddha in the Hindu monogram of planets. Moreover, wefind the Talmudists holding that Jesus was inspired by the genius of Mercury. ** The Nazarene reformer had undoubtedly belonged to one of these sects; though,perhaps, it would be next to impossible to decide absolutely which. But what isself-evident is that he preached the philosophy of Buddha-Sakyamuni. Denouncedby the later prophets, cursed by the Sanhedrim, the nazars--they were confoundedwith others of that name \"who separated themselves unto that shame,\" *** theywere secretly, if not openly persecuted by the orthodox synagogue. It becomesclear why Jesus was treated with such contempt from the first, and deprecatinglycalled \"the Galilean.\" Nathaniel inquires--\"Can there any good thing come out ofNazareth?\" (John i. 46) at the very beginning of his career; and merely becausehe knows him to be a nazar. Does not this clearly hint, that even the oldernazars were not really Hebrew religionists, but rather a class of Chaldeantheurgists? Besides, as the New Testament is noted for its mistranslations andtransparent falsifications of texts, we may justly suspect that the wordNazareth was substituted for that of nasaria, or nozari. That it originally read\"Can any good thing come from a nozari, or Nazarene\"; a follower of St. John theBaptist, with whom we see him associating from his first appearance on the stageof action, after having been lost sight of for a period of nearly twenty years.The blunders of the Old Testament are as nothing to those of the gospels.Nothing shows better than these self-evident contradictions the system of piousfraud upon which the super-structure of the Messiahship rests. \"This is Eliaswhich was for to come,\" says Matthew of John the Baptist, thus forcing anancient kabalistic tradition into the frame of evidence (xi. 14). But whenaddressing the Baptist himself, they ask him (John i. 21), \"Art thou Elias?\"\"And he saith I am not\"! Which knew best--John or his biographer? And which isdivine revelation? The motive of Jesus was evidently like that of Gautama-Buddha, to benefithumanity at large by producing a religious reform which should give it areligion of pure ethics; the true knowledge of God and nature having remaineduntil then solely in the hands of the esoteric sects, and their adepts. As Jesusused oil and the Essenes never used aught but pure water, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_200] he cannot be called astrict Essene. On the other hand, the Essenes were also \"set apart\"; they werehealers (assaya) and dwelt in the desert as all ascetics did. But although he did not abstain from wine he could have remained a Nazarene allthe same. For in chapter vi. of Numbers, we see that after the priest has waveda part of the hair of a Nazorite for a wave-offering before the Lord, \"afterthat a Nazarene may drink wine\" (v. 20). The bitter denunciation by the reformerof the people who would be satisfied with nothing is worded in the followingexclamation: \"John came neither eating nor drinking and they say: 'He hath adevil.' . . . The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say: 'Behold aman gluttonous and a wine-bibber.' \" And yet he was an Essene and Nazarene, forwe not only find him sending a message to Herod, to say that he was one of thosewho cast out demons, and who performed cures, but actually calling himself aprophet and declaring himself equal to the other prophets. * The author of Sod shows Matthew trying to connect the appellation of Nazarenewith a prophecy, ** and inquires \"Why then does Matthew state that the prophetsaid he should be called Nazaria?\" Simply \"because he belonged to that sect, anda prophecy would confirm his claims to the Messiahship. . . . Now it does notappear that the prophets anywhere state that the Messiah will be called aNazarene.\" *** The fact alone that Matthew tries in the last verse of chapterii. to strengthen his claim that Jesus dwelt in Nazareth merely to fulfil aprophecy, does more than weaken the argument, it upsets it entirely; for thefirst two chapters have sufficiently been proved later forgeries. Baptism is one of the oldest rites and was practiced by all the nations in theirMysteries, as sacred ablutions. Dunlap seems to derive the name of the nazarsfrom nazah, sprinkling; Bahak-Zivo is the genius who called the world intoexistence **** out of the \"dark water,\" say the Nazarenes; and Richardson'sPersian, Arabic, and English Lexicon asserts that the word Bahak means\"raining.\" But the Bahak-Zivo of the Nazarenes cannot be traced so easily toBacchus, who \"was the rain-god,\" for the nazars were the greatest opponents ofBacchus-worship. \"Bacchus is brought up by the Hyades, the rain-nymphs,\" saysPreller; ***** who shows, furthermore, that ****** at the conclusion of thereligious Mysteries, the priests baptized (washed) their monuments and anointedthem with oil. All this is but a very indirect proof. The Jordan baptism neednot be shown a substitution for the exoteric Bacchic rites and the libations inhonor of Adonis or Adoni--whom the Nazarenes abhorred--in order to prove it tohave been a sect sprung from the \"Mysteries\" of the \"Secret Doctrine\"; and theirrites can by no means be confounded with those of the Pagan populace, who hadsimply fallen into the idolatrous and unreasoning faith of all plebeianmultitudes. John was the prophet of these Nazarenes, and in Galilee he wastermed \"the Saviour,\" but he was not the founder of that sect which derived itstradition from the remotest Chaldeo-Akkadian theurgy. \"The early plebeian Israelites were Canaanites and Phoenicians, with the sameworship of the Phallic gods--Bacchus, Baal or Adon, Iacchos--Iao or Jehovah\";but even among them there had always been a class of initiated adepts. Later,the character of this plebe was modified by Assyrian conquests; and, finally,the Persian colonizations superimposed the Pharisean and Eastern ideas andusages, from which the Old Testament and the Mosaic institutes were derived. TheAsmonean priest-kings promulgated the canon of the Old Testament incontradistinction to the Apocrypha or Secret Books of the AlexandrianJews--kabalists. * Till John Hyrcanus they were Asideans (Chasidim) andPharisees (Parsees), but then they became Sadducees or Zadokites--asserters ofsacerdotal rule as contradistinguished from rabbinical. The Pharisees werelenient and intellectual, the Sadducees, bigoted and cruel. Says the Codex: \"John, son of the Aba-Saba-Zacharia, conceived by his motherAnasabet in her hundredth year, had baptized for forty-two years ** when JesuMessias came to the Jordan to be baptized with John's baptism. . . . But he willpervert John's doctrine, changing the baptism of the Jordan, and perverting thesayings of justice.\" *** The baptism was changed from water to that of the Holy Ghost, undoubtedly inconsequence of the ever-dominant idea of the Fathers to institute a reform, andmake the Christians distinct from St. John's Nazarenes, the Nabatheans andEbionites, in order to make room for new dogmas. Not only do the Synoptics tellus that Jesus was baptizing the same as John, but John's own disciplescomplained of it, though surely Jesus cannot be accused of following a purelyBacchic rite. The parenthesis in verse 2d of John iv., \" . . . though Jesushimself baptized not,\" is so clumsy as to show upon its face that it is aninterpolation, Matthew makes John say that he that should come after him wouldnot baptize them with water \"but with the Holy Ghost and fire.\" Mark, Luke, andJohn corroborate these words. Water, fire, and spirit, or Holy Ghost, have alltheir origin in India, as we will show. Now there is one very strange peculiarity about this sentence. It is flatlydenied in Acts xix. 2-5. Apollos, a Jew of Alexandria, belonged to the sect ofSt. John's disciples; he had been baptized, and instructed others in thedoctrines of the Baptist. And yet when Paul, cleverly profiting by his absenceat Corinth, finds certain disciples of Apollos' at Ephesus, and asks themwhether they received the Holy Ghost, he is naively answered, \"We have not somuch as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost!\" \"Unto what then were youbaptized?\" he inquires. \"Unto John's baptism,\" they say. Then Paul is made torepeat the words attributed to John by the Synoptics; and these men \"werebaptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,\" exhibiting, moreover, at the sameinstant, the usual polyglot gift which accompanies the descent of the HolyGhost. How then? St. John the Baptist, who is called the \"precursor,\" that \"theprophecy might be fulfilled,\" the great prophet and martyr, whose words ought tohave had such an importance in the eyes of his disciples, announces the \"HolyGhost\" to his listeners; causes crowds to assemble on the shores of the Jordan,where, at the great ceremony of Christ's baptism, the promised \"Holy Ghost\"appears within the opened heavens, and the multitude hears the voice, and yetthere are disciples of St. John who have \"never so much as heard whether therebe any Holy Ghost\"! Verily the disciples who wrote the Codex Nazaraeus were right. Only it is notJesus himself, but those who came after him, and who concocted the Bible to suitthemselves, that \"perverted John's doctrine, changed the baptism of the Jordan,and perverted the sayings of justice.\" It is useless to object that the present Codex was written centuries after thedirect apostles of John preached. So were our Gospels. When this astoundinginterview of Paul with the \"Baptists\" took place, Bardesanes had not yetappeared among them, and the sect was not considered a \"heresy.\" Moreover, weare enabled to judge how little St. John's promise of the \"Holy Ghost,\" and theappearance of the \"Ghost\" himself, had affected his disicples, by thedispleasure shown by them toward the disciples of Jesus, and the kind of rivalrymanifested from the first. Nay, so little is John himself sure of the identityof Jesus with the expected Messiah, that after the famous scene of the baptismat the Jordan, and the oral assurance by the Holy Ghost Himself that \"This is mybeloved Son\" (Matthew iii. 17), we find \"the Precursor,\" in Matthew xi., sendingtwo of his disciples from his prison to inquire of Jesus: \"Art thou he thatshould come, or do we look for another\"!! This flagrant contradiction alone ought to have long ago satisfied reasonableminds as to the putative divine inspiration of the New Testament. But we may offer another question: If baptism is the sign of regeneration, andan ordinance instituted by Jesus, why do not Christians now baptize as Jesus ishere represented as doing, \"with the Holy Ghost and with fire,\" instead offollowing the custom of the Nazarenes? In making these palpable interpolations,what possible motive could Irenaeus have had except to cause people to believethat the appellation of Nazarene, which Jesus bore, came only from his father'sresidence at Nazareth, and not from his affiliation with the sect of Nazaria,the healers? This expedient of Irenaeus was a most unfortunate one, for from time immemorialthe prophets of old had been thundering against the baptism of fire as practicedby their neighbors, which imparted the \"spirit of prophecy,\" or the Holy Ghost.But the case was desperate; the Christians were universally called Nazoraens andIessaens (according to Epiphanius), and Christ simply ranked as a Jewish prophetand healer--so self-styled, so accepted by his own disciples, and so regarded bytheir followers. In such a state of things there was no room for either a newhierarchy or a new God-head; and since Irenaeus had undertaken the business ofmanufacturing both, he had to put together such materials as were available, andfill the gaps with his own fertile inventions. To assure ourselves that Jesus was a true Nazarene--albeit with ideas of a newreform--we must not search for the proof in the translated Gospels, but in suchoriginal versions as are accessible. Tischendorf, in his translation from theGreek of Luke iv. 34, has it \"Iesou Nazarene\"; and in the Syriac it reads\"Iasoua, thou Nazaria.\" Thus, if we take in account all that is puzzling andincomprehensible in the four Gospels, revised and corrected as they now stand,we shall easily see for ourselves that the true, original Christianity, such aswas preached by Jesus, is to be found only in the so-called Syrian heresies.Only from them can we extract any clear notions about what was primitiveChristianity. Such was the faith of Paul, when Tertullus the orator accused theapostle before the governor Felix. What he complained of was that they had found\"that man a mover of sedition . . . a ringleader of the sect of theNazarenes\"; * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_210] and, whilePaul denies every other accusation, he confesses that \"after the way which theycall heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers.\" **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_211] This confession is a wholerevelation. It shows: 1, that Paul admitted belonging to the sect of theNazarenes; 2, that he worshipped the God of his fathers, not the trinitarianChristian God, of whom he knows nothing, and who was not invented until afterhis death; and, 3, that this unlucky confession satisfactorily explains why thetreatise, Acts of the Apostles, together with John's Revelation, which at oneperiod was utterly rejected, were kept out of the canon of the New Testament forsuch a length of time. At Byblos, the neophytes as well as the hierophants were, after participating inthe Mysteries, obliged to fast and remain in solitude for some time. There wasstrict fasting and preparation before as well as after the Bacchic, Adonian, andEleusinian orgies; and Herodotus hints, with fear and veneration about the LAKEof Bacchus, in which \"they (the priests) made at night exhibitions of his lifeand sufferings.\" * In the Mithraic sacrifices, during the initiation, apreliminary scene of death was simulated by the neophyte, and it preceded thescene showing him himself \"being born again by the rite of baptism.\" A portionof this ceremony is still enacted in the present day by the Masons, when theneophyte, as the Grand Master Hiram Abiff, lies dead, and is raised by thestrong grip of the lion's paw. The priests were circumcised. The neophyte could not be initiated without havingbeen present at the solemn Mysteries of the LAKE. The Nazarenes were baptized inthe Jordan; and could not be baptized elsewhere; they were also circumcised, andhad to fast before as well as after the purification by baptism. Jesus is saidto have fasted in the wilderness for forty days, immediately after his baptism.To the present day, there is outside every temple in India, a lake, stream, or areservoir full of holy water, in which the Brahmans and the Hindu devotees bathedaily. Such places of consecrated water are necessary to every temple. Thebathing festivals, or baptismal rites, occur twice every year; in October andApril. Each lasts ten days; and, as in ancient Egypt and Greece, the statues oftheir gods, goddesses, and idols are immersed in water by the priests; theobject of the ceremony being to wash away from them the sins of theirworshippers which they have taken upon themselves, and which pollute them, untilwashed off by holy water. During the Aratty, the bathing ceremony, the principalgod of every temple is carried in solemn procession to be baptized in the sea.The Brahman priests, carrying the sacred images, are followed generally by theMaharajah--barefoot, and nearly naked. Three times the priests enter the sea;the third time they carry with them the whole of the images. Holding them upwith prayers repeated by the whole congregation, the Chief Priest plunges thestatues of the gods thrice in the name of the mystic trinity, into the water;after which they are purified. ** The Orphic hymn calls water the greatestpurifier of men and gods. Our Nazarene sect is known to have existed some 150 years B.C., and to havelived on the banks of the Jordan, and on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea,according to Pliny and Josephus. * But in King's Gnostics, we find quotedanother statement by Josephus from verse 13, which says that the Essenes hadbeen established on the shores of the Dead Sea \"for thousands of ages\" beforePliny's time. ** According to Munk the term \"Galilean\" is nearly synonymous with that of\"Nazarene\"; furthermore, he shows the relations of the former with the Gentilesas very intimate. The populace had probably gradually adopted, in their constantintercourse, certain rites and modes of worship of the Pagans; and the scornwith which the Galileans were regarded by the orthodox Jews is attributed by himto the same cause. Their friendly relations had certainly led them, at a laterperiod, to adopt the \"Adonia,\" or the sacred rites over the body of the lamentedAdonis, as we find Jerome fairly lamenting this circumstance. \"Over Bethlehem,\"he says, \"the grove of Thammuz, that is of Adonis, was casting its shadow! Andin the GROTTO where formerly the infant Jesus cried, the lover of Venus wasbeing mourned.\" *** It was after the rebellion of Bar Cochba, that the Roman Emperor established theMysteries of Adonis at the Sacred Cave in Bethlehem; and who knows but this wasthe petra or rock-temple on which the church was built? The Boar of Adonis wasplaced above the gate of Jerusalem which looked toward Bethlehem. Munk says that the \"Nazireate was an institution established before the laws ofMusah.\" **** This is evident; as we find this sect not only mentioned butminutely described in Numbers (chap. vi.). In the commandment given in thischapter to Moses by the \"Lord,\" it is easy to recognize the rites and laws ofthe Priests of Adonis. ***** The abstinence and purity strictly prescribed inboth sects are identical. Both allowed their hair to grow long *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_219] as the Hindu coenobitesand fakirs do to this day, while other castes shave their hair and abstain oncertain days from wine. The prophet Elijah, a Nazarene, is described in 2 Kings,and by Josephus as \"a hairy man girt with a girdle of leather.\" ** And John theBaptist and Jesus are both represented as wearing very long hair. *** John is\"clothed with camel's hair\" and wearing a girdle of hide, and Jesus in a longgarment \"without any seams\" . . . \"and very white, like snow,\" says Mark; thevery dress worn by the Nazarene Priests and the Pythagorean and BuddhistEssenes, as described by Josephus. If we carefully trace the terms nazar, and nazaret, throughout the best knownworks of ancient writers, we will meet them in connection with \"Pagan\" as wellas Jewish adepts. Thus, Alexander Polyhistor says of Pythagoras that he was adisciple of the Assyrian Nazaret, whom some suppose to be Ezekiel. DiogenesLaertius states most positively that Pythagoras, after being initiated into allthe Mysteries of the Greeks and barbarians, \"went into Egypt and afterwardvisited the Chaldeans and Magi\"; and Apuleius maintains that it was Zoroasterwho instructed Pythagoras. Were we to suggest that the Hebrew nazars, the railing prophets of the \"Lord,\"had been initiated into the so-called Pagan mysteries, and belonged (or at leasta majority of them) to the same Lodge or circle of adepts as those who wereconsidered idolaters; that their \"circle of prophets\" was but a collateralbranch of a secret association, which we may well term \"international,\" what avisitation of Christian wrath would we not incur! And still, the case looksstrangely suspicious. Let us first recall to our mind that which Ammianus Marcellinus, and otherhistorians relate of Darius Hystaspes. The latter, penetrating into Upper India(Bactriana), learned pure rites, and stellar and cosmical sciences fromBrahmans, and communicated them to the Magi. Now Hystaspes is shown in historyto have crushed the Magi; and introduced--or rather forced upon them--the purereligion of Zoroaster, that of Ormazd. How is it, then, that an inscription isfound on the tomb of Darius, stating that he was \"teacher and hierophant ofmagic, or Magianism?\" Evidently there must be some historical mistake, andhistory confesses it. In this imbroglio of names, Zoroaster, the teacher andinstructor of Pythagoras, can be neither the Zoroaster nor Zarathustra whoinstituted sun-worship among the Parsees; nor he who appeared at the court ofGushtasp (Hystaspes) the alleged father of Darius; nor, again, the Zoroaster whoplaced his magi above the kings themselves. The oldest Zoroastrianscripture--the Avesta--does not betray the slightest traces of the reformerhaving ever been acquainted with any of the nations that subsequently adoptedhis mode of worship. He seems utterly ignorant of the neighbors of Western Iran,the Medes, the Assyrians, the Persians, and others. If we had no other evidencesof the great antiquity of the Zoroastrian religion than the discovery of theblunder committed by some scholars in our own century, who regarded KingVistaspa (Gushtasp) as identical with the father of Darius, whereas the Persiantradition points directly to Vistaspa as to the last of the line of Kaianianprinces who ruled in Bactriana, it ought to be enough, for the Assyrian conquestof Bactriana took place 1,200 years B.C. * Therefore, it is but natural that we should see in the appellation of Zoroasternot a name but a generic term, whose significance must be left to philologiststo agree upon. Guru, in Sanscrit, is a spiritual teacher; and as Zuruastarameans in the same language he who worships the sun, why is it impossible, thatby some natural change of language, due to the great number of different nationswhich were converted to the sun-worship, the word guru-astara, the spiritualteacher of sun-worship, so closely resembling the name of the founder of thisreligion, became gradually transformed in its primal form of Zuryastara orZoroaster? The opinion of the kabalists is that there was but one Zarathustraand many guruastars or spiritual teachers, and that one such guru, or ratherhuru-aster, as he is called in the old manuscripts, was the instructor ofPythagoras. To philology and our readers we leave the explanation for what it isworth. Personally we believe in it, as we credit on this subject kabalistictradition far more than the explanation of scientists, no two of whom have beenable to agree up to the present year. Aristotle states that Zoroaster lived 6,000 years before Christ; Hermippus ofAlexandria, who is said to have read the genuine books of the Zoroastrians,although Alexander the Great is accused of having destroyed them, showsZoroaster as the pupil of Azonak (Azon-ach, or the Azon-God) and as having lived5,000 years before the fall of Troy. Er or Eros, whose vision is related byPlato in the Republic, is declared by Clement to have been Zordusth. While theMagus who dethroned Cambyses was a Mede, and Darius proclaims that he put downthe Magian rites to establish those of Ormazd, Xanthus of Lydia declaresZoroaster to have been the chief of the Magi! Which of them is wrong? or are they all right, and only the modern interpretersfail to explain the difference between the Reformer and his apostles andfollowers? This blundering of our commentators reminds us of that of Suetonius,who mistook the Christians for one Christos, or Crestos, as he spells it, andassured his readers that Claudius banished him for the disturbance he made amongthe Jews. Finally, and to return again to the nazars, Zaratus is mentioned by Pliny in thefollowing words: \"He was Zoroaster and Nazaret.\" As Zoroaster is called princepsof the Magi, and nazar signifies separated or consecrated, is it not a Hebrewrendering of mag? Volney believes so. The Persian word Na-zaruan means millionsof years, and refers to the Chaldean \"Ancient of Days.\" Hence the name of theNazars or Nazarenes, who were consecrated to the service of the Supreme one God,the kabalistic En-Soph, or the Ancient of Days, the \"Aged of the aged.\" But the word nazar may also be found in India. In Hindustani nazar is sight,internal or supernatural vision; nazar band-i means fascination, a mesmeric ormagical spell; and nazaran is the word for sightseeing or vision. Professor Wilder thinks that as the word Zeruana is nowhere to be found in theAvesta, but only in the later Parsi books, it came from the Magians, whocomposed the Persian sacred caste in the Sassan period, but were originallyAssyrians. \"Turan, of the poets,\" he says, \"I consider to be Aturia, or Assyria;and that Zohak (Az-dahaka, Dei-okes, or Astyages), the Serpent-king, wasAssyrian, Median, and Babylonian--when those countries were united.\" This opinion does not, however, in the least implicate our statement that thesecret doctrines of the Magi, of the pre-Vedic Buddhists, of the hierophants ofthe Egyptian Thoth or Hermes, and of the adepts of whatever age and nationality,including the Chaldean kabalists and the Jewish nazars, were identical from thebeginning. When we use the term Buddhists, we do not mean to imply by it eitherthe exoteric Buddhism instituted by the followers of Gautama-Buddha, nor themodern Buddhistic religion, but the secret philosophy of Sakyamuni, which in itsessence is certainly identical with the ancient wisdom-religion of thesanctuary, the pre-Vedic Brahmanism. The \"schism\" of Zoroaster, as it is called,is a direct proof of it. For it was no schism, strictly speaking, but merely apartially-public exposition of strictly monotheistic religious truths, hithertotaught only in the sanctuaries, and that he had learned from the Brahmans.Zoroaster, the primeval institutor of sun-worship, cannot be called the founderof the dualistic system; neither was he the first to teach the unity of God, forhe taught but what he had learned himself with the Brahmans. And thatZarathustra and his followers, the Zoroastrians, \"had been settled in Indiabefore they immigrated into Persia,\" is also proved by Max Muller. \"That theZoroastrians and their ancestors started from India,\" he says, \"during theVaidik period, can be proved as distinctly as that the inhabitants of Massiliastarted from Greece. . . . Many of the gods of the Zoroastrians come out . . .as mere reflections and deflections of the primitive and authentic gods of theVeda.\" * If, now, we can prove--and we can do so on the evidence of the Kabala and theoldest traditions of the wisdom-religion, the philosophy of the oldsanctuaries--that all these gods, whether of the Zoroastrians or of the Veda,are but so many personated occult powers of nature, the faithful servants of theadepts of secret wisdom--Magic--we are on secure ground. Thus, whether we say that Kabalism and Gnosticism proceeded from Masdeanism orZoroastrianism, it is all the same, unless we meant the exoteric worship--whichwe do not. Likewise, and in this sense, we may echo King, the author of theGnostics, and several other archaeologists, and maintain that both the formerproceeded from Buddhism, at once the simplest and most satisfying ofphilosophies, and which resulted in one of the purest religions of the world. Itis only a matter of chronology to decide which of these religions, differing butin external form, is the oldest, therefore the least adulterated. But even thisbears but very indirectly, if at all, on the subject we treat of. Already sometime before our era, the adepts, except in India, had ceased to congregate inlarge communities; but whether among the Essenes, or the Neo-platonists, or,again, among the innumerable struggling sects born but to die, the samedoctrines, identical in substance and spirit, if not always in form, areencountered. By Buddhism, therefore, we mean that religion signifying literallythe doctrine of wisdom, and which by many ages antedates the metaphysicalphilosophy of Siddhartha Sakyamuni. After nineteen centuries of enforced eliminations from the canonical books ofevery sentence which might put the investigator on the true path, it has becomevery difficult to show, to the satisfaction of exact science, that the \"Pagan\"worshippers of Adonis, their neighbors, the Nazarenes, and the PythagoreanEssenes, the healing Therapeutes, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_224] the Ebionites, and othersects, were all, with very slight differences, followers of the ancient theurgicMysteries. And yet by analogy and a close study of the hidden sense of theirrites and customs, we can trace their kinship. It was given to a contemporary of Jesus to become the means of pointing out toposterity, by his interpretation of the oldest literature of Israel, how deeplythe kabalistic philosophy agreed in its esoterism with that of the profoundestGreek thinkers. This contemporary, an ardent disciple of Plato and Aristotle,was Philo Judaeus. While explaining the Mosaic books according to a purelykabalistic method, he is the famous Hebrew writer whom Kingsley calls the Fatherof New Platonism. It is evident that Philo's Therapeutes are a branch of the Essenes. Their nameindicates it--Εσσαιος, Asaya, physician. Hence, the contradictions, forgeries,and other desperate expedients to reconcile the prophecies of the Jewish canonwith the Galilean nativity and god-ship. Luke, who was a physician, is designated in the Syriac texts as Asaia, theEssaian or Essene. Josephus and Philo Judaeus have sufficiently described thissect to leave no doubt in our mind that the Nazarene Reformer, after havingreceived his education in their dwellings in the desert, and been duly initiatedin the Mysteries, preferred the free and independent life of a wanderingNazaria, and so separated or inazarenized himself from them, thus becoming atravelling Therapeute, a Nazaria, a healer. Every Therapeute, before quittinghis community, had to do the same. Both Jesus and St. John the Baptist preachedthe end of the Age; ** which proves their knowledge of the secret computation ofthe priests and kabalists, who with the chiefs of the Essene communities alonehad the secret of the duration of the cycles. The latter were kabalists andtheurgists; \"they had their mystic books, and predicted future events,\" saysMunk. *** Dunlap, whose personal researches seem to have been quite successful in thatdirection, traces the Essenes, Nazarenes, Dositheans, and some other sects ashaving all existed before Christ: \"They rejected pleasures, despised riches,loved one another, and more than other sects, neglected wedlock, deeming theconquest of the passions to be virtuous,\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_227] he says. These are all virtues preached by Jesus; and if we are to take the gospels as astandard of truth, Christ was a metempsychosist \"or re-incarnationist\"--againlike these same Essenes, whom we see were Pythagoreans in all their doctrine andhabits. Iamblichus asserts that the Samian philosopher spent a certain time atCarmel with them. ** In his discourses and sermons, Jesus always spoke inparables and used metaphors with his audience. This habit was again that of theEssenians and the Nazarenes; the Galileans who dwelt in cities and villages werenever known to use such allegorical language. Indeed, some of his disciplesbeing Galileans as well as himself, felt even surprised to find him using withthe people such a form of expression. \"Why speakest thou unto them inparables?\" *** they often inquired. \"Because, it is given unto you to know theMysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given,\" was the reply,which was that of an initiate. \"Therefore, I speak unto them in parables;because, they seeing, see not, and hearing, they hear not, neither do theyunderstand.\" Moreover, we find Jesus expressing his thoughts still clearer--andin sentences which are purely Pythagorean--when, during the Sermon on the Mount,he says: \"Give ye not that which is sacred to the dogs,Neither cast ye your pearls before swine;For the swine will tread them under their feetAnd the dogs will turn and rend you.\"Professor A. Wilder, the editor of Taylor's Eleusinian Mysteries, observes \"alike disposition on the part of Jesus and Paul to classify their doctrines asesoteric and exoteric, the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God 'for the apostles,'and 'parables' for the multitude. 'We speak wisdom,' says Paul, 'among them thatare perfect' (or initiated).\" **** In the Eleusinian and other Mysteries the participants were always divided intotwo classes, the neophytes and the perfect. The former were sometimes admittedto the preliminary initiation: the dramatic performance of Ceres, or the soul,descending to Hades. ***** But it was given only to the \"perfect\" to enjoy andlearn the Mysteries of the divine Elysium, the celestial abode of the blessed;this Elysium being unquestionably the same as the \"Kingdom of Heaven.\" Tocontradict or reject the above, would be merely to shut one's eyes to the truth. The narrative of the Apostle Paul, in his second Epistle to the Corinthians(xii. 3, 4), has struck several scholars, well versed in the descriptions of themystical rites of the initiation given by some classics, as alluding mostundoubtedly to the final Epopteia. * \"I knew a certain man--whether in body oroutside of body, I know not: God knoweth--who was rapt into Paradise, and heardthings ineffable αῤετα ρεματα, which it is not lawful for a man to repeat.\"These words have rarely, so far as we know, been regarded by commentators as anallusion to the beatific visions of an \"initiated\" seer. But the phraseology isunequivocal. These things \"which it is not lawful to repeat,\" are hinted at inthe same words, and the reason for it assigned, is the same as that which wefind repeatedly expressed by Plato, Proclus, Iamblichus, Herodotus, and otherclassics. \"We speak WISDOM only among them who are PERFECT,\" says Paul; theplain and undeniable translation of the sentence being: \"We speak of theprofounder (or final) esoteric doctrines of the Mysteries (which weredenominated wisdom) only among them who are initiated.\" ** So in relation to the\"man who was rapt into Paradise\"--and who was evidently Paul himself ***--theChristian word Paradise having replaced that of Elysium. To complete the proof,we might recall the words of Plato, given elsewhere, which show that before aninitiate could see the gods in their purest light, he had to become liberatedfrom his body; i.e., to separate his astral soul from it. **** Apuleius alsodescribes his initiation into the Mysteries in the same way: \"I approached theconfines of death; and, having trodden on the threshold of Proserpina, returned,having been carried through all the elements. In the depths of midnight I sawthe sun glittering with a splendid light, together with the infernal andsupernal gods, and to these divinities approaching, I paid the tribute of devoutadoration.\" ***** Thus, in common with Pythagoras and other hierophant reformers, Jesus dividedhis teachings into exoteric and esoteric. Following faithfully thePythagoreo-Essenean ways, he never sat at a meal without saying \"grace.\" \"Thepriest prays before his meal,\" says Josephus, describing the Essenes. Jesus alsodivided his followers into \"neophytes,\" \"brethren,\" and the \"perfect,\" if we mayjudge by the difference he made between them. But his career at least as apublic Rabbi, was of a too short duration to allow him to establish a regularschool of his own; and with the exception, perhaps, of John, it does not seemthat he had initiated any other apostle. The Gnostic amulets and talismans aremostly the emblems of the apocalyptic allegories. The \"seven vowels\" are closelyrelated to the \"seven seals\"; and the mystic title Abraxas, partakes as much ofthe composition of Shem Hamphirosh, \"the holy word\" or ineffable name, as thename called: The word of God, that \"no man knew but he himself,\" * as Johnexpresses it. It would be difficult to escape from the well-adduced proofs that the Apocalypseis the production of an initiated kabalist, when this Revelation presents wholepassages taken from the Books of Enoch and Daniel, which latter is in itself anabridged imitation of the former; and when, furthermore, we ascertain that theOphite Gnostics who rejected the Old Testament entirely, as \"emanating from aninferior being (Jehovah),\" accepted the most ancient prophets, such as Enoch,and deduced the strongest support from this book for their religious tenets, thedemonstration becomes evident. We will show further how closely related are allthese doctrines. Besides, there is the history of Domitian's persecutions ofmagicians and philosophers, which affords as good a proof as any that John wasgenerally considered a kabalist. As the apostle was included among the number,and, moreover, conspicuous, the imperial edict banished him not only from Rome,but even from the continent. It was not the Christians whom--confounding themwith the Jews, as some historians will have it--the emperor persecuted, but theastrologers and kabalists. ** The accusations against Jesus of practicing the magic of Egypt were numerous,and at one time universal, in the towns where he was known. The Pharisees, asclaimed in the Bible, had been the first to fling it in his face, although RabbiWise considers Jesus himself a Pharisee. The Talmud certainly points to Jamesthe Just as one of that sect. * But these partisans are known to have alwaysstoned every prophet who denounced their evil ways, and it is not on this factthat we base our assertion. These accused him of sorcery, and of driving outdevils by Beelzebub, their prince, with as much justice as later the Catholicclergy had to accuse of the same more than one innocent martyr. But JustinMartyr states on better authority that the men of his time who were not Jewsasserted that the miracles of Jesus were performed by magical art--μαγικεπηαντασια--the very expression used by the skeptics of those days to designatethe feats of thaumaturgy accomplished in the Pagan temples. \"They even venturedto call him a magician and a deceiver of the people,\" complains the martyr. **In the Gospel of Nicodemus (the Acta Pilate), the Jews bring the same accusationbefore Pilate. \"Did we not tell thee he was a magician?\" *** Celsus speaks ofthe same charge, and as a Neo-platonist believes in it. **** The Talmudicliterature is full of the most minute particulars, and their greatest accusationis that \"Jesus could fly as easily in the air as others could walk.\" ***** St.Austin asserted that it was generally believed that he had been initiated inEgypt, and that he wrote books concerning magic, which he delivered toJohn. ****** There was a work called Magia Jesu Christi, which was attributed toJesus ******* himself. In the Clementine Recognitions the charge is broughtagainst Jesus that he did not perform his miracles as a Jewish prophet, but as amagician, i.e., an initiate of the \"heathen\" temples. ******** It was usual then, as it is now, among the intolerant clergy of opposingreligions, as well as among the lower classes of society, and even among thosepatricians who, for various reasons had been excluded from any participation ofthe Mysteries, to accuse, sometimes, the highest hierophants and adepts ofsorcery and black magic. So Apuleius, who had been initiated, was likewiseaccused of witchcraft, and of carrying about him the figure of a skeleton--apotent agent, as it is asserted, in the operations of the black art. But one ofthe best and most unquestionable proofs of our assertion may be found in theso-called Museo Gregoriano. On the sarcophagus, which is panelled withbas-reliefs representing the miracles of Christ, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_247] may be seen the fullfigure of Jesus, who, in the resurrection of Lazarus, appears beardless \"andequipped with a wand in the received guise of a necromancer (?) whilst thecorpse of Lazarus is swathed in bandages exactly as an Egyptian mummy.\" Had posterity been enabled to have several such representations executed duringthe first century when the figure, dress, and every-day habits of the Reformerwere still fresh in the memory of his contemporaries, perhaps the Christianworld would be more Christ-like; the dozens of contradictory, groundless, andutterly meaningless speculations about the \"Son of Man\" would have beenimpossible; and humanity would now have but one religion and one God. It is thisabsence of all proof, the lack of the least positive clew about him whomChristianity has deified, that has caused the present state of perplexity. Nopictures of Christ were possible until after the days of Constantine, when theJewish element was nearly eliminated among the followers of the new religion.The Jews, apostles, and disciples, whom the Zoroastrians and the Parsees hadinoculated with a holy horror of any form of images, would have considered it asacrilegious blasphemy to represent in any way or shape their master. The onlyauthorized image of Jesus, even in the days of Tertullian, was an allegoricalrepresentation of the \"Good Shepherd,\" ** which was no portrait, but the figureof a man with a jackal-head, like Anubis. *** On this gem, as seen in thecollection of Gnostic amulets, the Good Shepherd bears upon his shoulders thelost lamb. He seems to have a human head upon his neck; but, as King correctlyobserves, \"it only seems so to the uninitiated eye.\" On closer inspection, hebecomes the double-headed Anubis, having one head human, the other a jackal's,whilst his girdle assumes the form of a serpent rearing aloft its crested head.\"This figure,\" adds the author of the Gnostics, etc., \"had two meanings--oneobvious for the vulgar; the other mystical, and recognizable by the initiatedalone. It was perhaps the signet of some chief teacher or apostle.\" * Thisaffords a fresh proof that the Gnostics and early orthodox (?) Christians werenot so wide apart in their secret doctrine. King deduces from a quotation fromEpiphanius, that even as late as 400 A.D. it was considered an atrocious sin toattempt to represent the bodily appearance of Christ. Epiphanius ** brings it asan idolatrous charge against the Carpocratians that \"they kept paintedportraits, and even gold and silver images, and in other materials, which theypretended to be portraits of Jesus, and made by Pilate after the likeness ofChrist. . . . These they keep in secret, along with Pythagoras, Plato, andAristotle, and setting them all up together, they worship and offer sacrificesunto them after the Gentiles' fashion.\" What would the pious Epiphanius say were he to resuscitate and step into St.Peter's Cathedral at Rome! Ambrosius seems also very desperate at the idea--thatsome persons fully credited the statement of Lampridius that Alexander Severushad in his private chapel an image of Christ among other great philosophers.\"That the Pagans should have preserved the likeness of Christ,\" he exclaims,\"but the disciples have neglected to do so, is a notion the mind shudders toentertain, much less to believe.\" All this points undeniably to the fact, that except a handful of self-styledChristians who subsequently won the day, all the civilized portion of the Paganswho knew of Jesus honored him as a philosopher, an adept whom they placed on thesame level with Pythagoras and Apollonius. Whence such a veneration on theirpart for a man, were he simply, as represented by the Synoptics, a poor, unknownJewish carpenter from Nazareth? As an incarnated God there is no single recordof him on this earth capable of withstanding the critical examination ofscience; as one of the greatest reformers, an inveterate enemy of everytheological dogmatism, a persecutor of bigotry, a teacher of one of the mostsublime codes of ethics, Jesus is one of the grandest and most clearly-definedfigures on the panorama of human history. His age may, with every day, bereceding farther and farther back into the gloomy and hazy mists of the past;and his theology--based on human fancy and supported by untenable dogmas may,nay, must with every day lose more of its unmerited prestige; alone the grandfigure of the philosopher and moral reformer instead of growing paler willbecome with every century more pronounced and more clearly defined. It willreign supreme and universal only on that day when the whole of humanityrecognizes but one father--the UNKNOWN ONE above--and one brother--the whole ofmankind below. In a pretended letter of Lentulus, a senator and a distinguished historian, tothe Roman senate, there is a description of the personal appearance of Jesus.The letter itself, written in horrid Latin, is pronounced a bare-faced forgery;but we find therein an expression which suggests many thoughts. Albeit a forgeryit is evident that whosoever invented it has nevertheless tried to followtradition as closely as possible. The hair of Jesus is represented in it as\"wavy and curling . . . flowing down upon his shoulders,\" and as \"having aparting in the middle of the head after the fashion of the Nazarenes.\" This lastsentence shows: 1. That there was such a tradition, based on the biblicaldescription of John the Baptist, the Nazaria, and the custom of this sect. 2.Had Lentulus been the author of this letter, it is difficult to believe thatPaul should never have heard of it; and had he known its contents, he wouldnever have pronounced it a shame for men to wear their hair long, * thus shaminghis Lord and Christ-God. 3. If Jesus did wear his hair long and \"parted in themiddle of the forehead, after the fashion of the Nazarenes (as well as John, theonly one of his apostles who followed it), then we have one good reason more tosay that Jesus must have belonged to the sect of the Nazarenes, and been calledNASARIA for this reason and not because he was an inhabitant of Nazareth; forthey never wore their hair long. The Nazarite, who separated himself unto theLord, allowed \"no razor to come upon his head.\" \"He shall be holy, and shall letthe locks of the hair of his head grow,\" says Numbers (vi. 5). Samson was aNazarite, i.e., vowed to the service of God, and in his hair was his strength.\"No razor shall come upon his head; the child shall be a Nazarite unto God fromthe womb\" (Judges xiii. 5). But the final and most reasonable conclusion to beinferred from this is that Jesus, who was so opposed to all the orthodox Jewishpractices, would not have allowed his hair to grow had he not belonged to thissect, which in the days of John the Baptist had already become a heresy in theeyes of the Sanhedrim. The Talmud, speaking of the Nazaria, or the Nazarenes(who had abandoned the world like Hindu yogis or hermits) calls them a sect ofphysicians, of wandering exorcists; as also does Jervis. \"They went about thecountry, living on alms and performing cures.\" ** Epiphanius says that theNazarenes come next in heresy to the Corinthians whether having existed \"beforethem or after them, nevertheless synchronous,\" and then adds that \"allChristians at that time were equally called Nazarenes\"! *** In the very first remark made by Jesus about John the Baptist, we find himstating that he is \"Elias, which was for to come.\" This assertion, if it is nota later interpolation for the sake of having a prophecy fulfilled, means againthat Jesus was a kabalist; unless indeed we have to adopt the doctrine of theFrench spiritists and suspect him of believing in reincarnation. Except thekabalistic sects of the Essenes, the Nazarenes, the disciples of Simeon BenIochai, and Hillel, neither the orthodox Jews, nor the Galileans, believed orknew anything about the doctrine of permutation. And the Sadducees rejected eventhat of the resurrection. \"But the author of this restitutionis was Mosah, our master, upon whom be peace!Who was the revolutio (transmigration) of Seth and Hebel, that he might coverthe nudity of his Father Adam--Primus,\" says the Kabala. * Thus, Jesus hintingthat John was the revolutio, or transmigration of Elias, seems to prove beyondany doubt the school to which he belonged. Until the present day uninitiated Kabalists and Masons believe permutation to besynonymous with transmigration and metempsychosis. But they are as much mistakenin regard to the doctrine of the true Kabalists as to that of the Buddhists.True, the Sohar says in one place, \"All souls are subject to transmigration . .. men do not know the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He; they do not know thatthey are brought before the tribunal, both before they enter this world andafter they quit it,\" and the Pharisees also held this doctrine, as Josephusshows (Antiquities, xviii. 13). Also the doctrine of Gilgul, held to the strangetheory of the \"Whirling of the Soul,\" which taught that the bodies of Jewsburied far away from the Holy Land, still preserve a particle of soul which canneither rest nor quit them, until it reaches the soil of the \"Promised Land.\"And this \"whirling\" process was thought to be accomplished by the soul beingconveyed back through an actual evolution of species; transmigrating from theminutest insect up to the largest animal. But this was an exoteric doctrine. Werefer the reader to the Kabbala Denudata of Henry Khunrath; his language,however obscure, may yet throw some light upon the subject. But this doctrine of permutation, or revolutio, must not be understood as abelief in reincarnation. That Moses was considered the transmigration of Abeland Seth, does not imply that the kabalists--those who were initiated atleast--believed that the identical spirit of either of Adam's sons reappearedunder the corporeal form of Moses. It only shows what was the mode of expressionthey used when hinting at one of the profoundest mysteries of the OrientalGnosis, one of the most majestic articles of faith of the Secret Wisdom. It waspurposely veiled so as to half conceal and half reveal the truth. It impliedthat Moses, like certain other god-like men, was believed to have reached thehighest of all states on earth:--the rarest of all psychological phenomena, theperfect union of the immortal spirit with the terrestrial duad had occurred. Thetrinity was complete. A god was incarnate. But how rare such incarnations! That expression, \"Ye are gods,\" which, to our biblical students, is a mereabstraction, has for the kabalists a vital significance. Each immortal spiritthat sheds its radiance upon a human being is a god--the Microcosmos of theMacrocosmos, part and parcel of the Unknown God, the First Cause of which it isa direct emanation. It is possessed of all the attributes of its parent source.Among these attributes are omniscience and omnipotence. Endowed with these, butyet unable to fully manifest them while in the body, during which time they areobscured, veiled, limited by the capabilities of physical nature, the thusdivinely-inhabited man may tower far above his kind, evince a god-like wisdom,and display deific powers; for while the rest of mortals around him are butovershadowed by their divine SELF, with every chance given to them to becomeimmortal hereafter, but no other security than their personal efforts to win thekingdom of heaven, the so chosen man has already become an immortal while yet onearth. His prize is secured. Henceforth he will live forever in eternal life.Not only he may have \"dominion\" * over all the works of creation by employingthe \"excellence\" of the NAME (the ineffable one) but be higher in this life,not, as Paul is made to say, \"a little lower than the angels.\" ** The ancients never entertained the sacrilegious thought that such perfectedentities were incarnations of the One Supreme and for ever invisible God. Nosuch profanation of the awful Majesty entered into their conceptions. Moses andhis antitypes and types were to them but complete men, gods on earth, for theirgods (divine spirits) had entered unto their hallowed tabernacles, the purifiedphysical bodies. The disembodied spirits of the heroes and sages were termedgods by the ancients. Hence, the accusation of polytheism and idolatry on thepart of those who were the first to anthropomorphize the holiest and purestabstractions of their forefathers. The real and hidden sense of this doctrine was known to all the initiates. TheTanaim imparted it to their elect ones, the Isarim, in the solemn solitudes ofcrypts and deserted places. It was one of the most esoteric and jealouslyguarded, for human nature was the same then as it is now, and the sacerdotalcaste as confident as now in the supremacy of its knowledge, and ambitious ofascendancy over the weaker masses; with the difference perhaps that itshierophants could prove the legitimacy of their claims and the plausibility oftheir doctrines, whereas now, believers must be content with blind faith. While the kabalists called this mysterious and rare occurrence of the union ofspirit with the mortal charge entrusted to its care, the \"descent of the AngelGabriel\" (the latter being a kind of generic name for it), the Messenger ofLife, and the angel Metatron; and while the Nazarenes termed the sameAbel-Zivo, * the Delegatus sent by the Lord of Celsitude, it was universallyknown as the \"Anointed Spirit.\" Thus it is the acceptation of this doctrine which caused the Gnostics tomaintain that Jesus was a man overshadowed by the Christos or Messenger of Life,and that his despairing cry from the cross \"Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabachthani,\" waswrung from him at the instant when he felt that this inspiring Presence hadfinally abandoned him, for--as some affirmed--his faith had also abandoned himwhen on the cross. The early Nazarenes, who must be numbered among the Gnostic sects, believingthat Jesus was a prophet, held, nevertheless, in relation to him the samedoctrine of the divine \"overshadowing,\" of certain \"men of God,\" sent for thesalvation of nations, and to recall them to the path of righteousness. \"TheDivine mind is eternal,\" says the Codex, ** \"and it is pure light, and pouredout through splendid and immense space (pleroma). It is Genetrix of the Æons.But one of them went to matter (chaos) stirring up confused (turbulentos)movements; and by a certain portion of heavenly light fashioned it, properlyconstituted for use and appearance, but the beginning of every evil. TheDemiurge (of matter) claimed divine honor. *** Therefore Christus (\"theanointed\"), the prince of the Æons (powers), was sent (expeditus), who taking onthe person of a most devout Jew, Iesu, was to conquer him; but who having laidit (the body) aside, departed on high.\" We will explain further on the fullsignificance of the name Christos and its mystic meaning. And now, in order to make such passages as the above more intelligible, we willendeavor to define, as briefly as possible, the dogmas in which, with verytrifling differences, nearly all the Gnostic sects believed. It is in Ephesusthat flourished in those days the greatest college, wherein the abstruseOriental speculations and the Platonic philosophy were taught in conjunction. Itwas a focus of the universal \"secret\" doctrines; the weird laboratory whence,fashioned in elegant Grecian phraseology, sprang the quintessence of Buddhistic,Zoroastrian, and Chaldean philosophy. Artemis, the gigantic concrete symbol oftheosophico-pantheistic abstractions, the great mother Multimamma, androgyne andpatroness of the \"Ephesian writings,\" was conquered by Paul; but although thezealous converts of the apostles pretended to burn all their books on \"curiousarts,\" τα περιεργα, enough of these remained for them to study when their firstzeal had cooled off. It is from Ephesus that spread nearly all the Gnosis whichantagonized so fiercely with the Irenaean dogmas; and still it was Ephesus, withher numerous collateral branches of the great college of the Essenes, whichproved to be the hot-bed of all the kabalistic speculations brought by theTanaim from the captivity. \"In Ephesus,\" says Matter, \"the notions of theJewish-Egyptian school, and the semi-Persian speculations of the kabalists hadthen recently come to swell the vast conflux of Grecian and Asiatic doctrines,so there is no wonder that teachers should have sprung up there who strove tocombine the religion newly preached by the apostle with the ideas there so longestablished.\" Had not the Christians burdened themselves with the Revelations of a littlenation, and accepted the Jehovah of Moses, the Gnostic ideas would never havebeen termed heresies; once relieved of their dogmatic exaggerations the worldwould have had a religious system based on pure Platonic philosophy, and surelysomething would then have been gained. Now let us see what are the greatest heresies of the Gnostics. We will selectBasilides as the standard for our comparisons, for all the founders of otherGnostic sects group round him, like a cluster of stars borrowing light fromtheir sun. Basilides maintained that he had all his doctrines from the Apostle Matthew, andfrom Peter through Glaucus, the disciple of the latter. * According toEusebius, ** he published twenty-four volumes of Interpretations upon theGospels, *** all of which were burned, a fact which makes us suppose that theycontained more truthful matter than the school of Irenaeus was prepared to deny.He asserted that the unknown, eternal, and uncreated Father having first broughtforth Nous, or Mind, the latter emanated from itself--the Logos. The Logos (theWord of John) emanated in its turn Phronesis, or the Intelligences (Divine-humanspirits). From Phronesis sprung Sophia, or feminine wisdom, andDynamis--strength. These were the personified attributes of the Mysteriousgodhead, the Gnostic quinternion, typifying the five spiritual, but intelligiblesubstances, personal virtues or beings external to the unknown godhead. This ispreeminently a kabalistic idea. It is still more Buddhistic. The earliest systemof the Buddhistic philosophy--which preceded by far Gautama-Buddha--is basedupon the uncreated substance of the \"Unknown,\" the A'di Buddha. * This eternal,infinite Monad possesses, as proper to his own essence, five acts of wisdom.From these it, by five separate acts of Dhyan, emitted five Dhyani Buddhas;these, like A'di Buddha, are quiescent in their system (passive). Neither A'di,nor either of the five Dhyani Buddhas, were ever incarnated, but seven of theiremanations became Avatars, i.e., were incarnated on this earth. Describing the Basilidean system, Irenaeus, quoting the Gnostics, declares asfollows: \"When the uncreated, unnamed Father saw the corruption of mankind, he sent hisfirst-born Nous, into the world, in the form of Christ, for the redemption ofall who believe in him, out of the power of those who fabricated the world (theDemiurgus, and his six sons, the planetary genii). He appeared amongst men asthe man, Jesus, and wrought miracles. This Christ did not die in person, butSimon the Cyrenian suffered in his stead, to whom he lent his bodily form; forthe Divine Power, the Nous of the Eternal Father, is not corporeal, and cannotdie. Whoso, therefore, maintains that Christ has died, is still the bondsman ofignorance; whoso denies the same, he is free, and hath understood the purpose ofthe Father.\" * So far, and taken in its abstract sense, we do not see anything blasphemous inthis system. It may be a heresy against the theology of Irenaeus andTertullian, ** but there is certainly nothing sacrilegious against the religiousidea itself, and it will seem to every impartial thinker far more consistentwith divine reverence than the anthropomorphism of actual Christianity. TheGnostics were called by the orthodox Christians, Docetae, or Illusionists, forbelieving that Christ did not, nor could, suffer death actually--in physicalbody. The later Brahmanical books contain, likewise, much that is repugnant tothe reverential feeling and idea of the Divinity; and as well as the Gnostics,the Brahmans explain such legends as may shock the divine dignity of theSpiritual beings called gods by attributing them to Maya or illusion. A people brought up and nurtured for countless ages among all the psychologicalphenomena of which the civilized (!) nations read, but reject as incredible andworthless, cannot well expect to have its religious system even understood--letalone appreciated. The profoundest and most transcendental speculations of theancient metaphysicians of India and other countries, are all based on that greatBuddhistic and Brahmanical principle underlying the whole of their religiousmetaphysics--illusion of the senses. Everything that is finite is illusion, allthat which is eternal and infinite is reality. Form, color, that which we hearand feel, or see with our mortal eyes, exists only so far as it can be conveyedto each of us through our senses. The universe for a man born blind does notexist in either form or color, but it exists in its privation (in theAristotelean sense), and is a reality for the spiritual senses of the blind man.We all live under the powerful dominion of phantasy. Alone the highest andinvisible originals emanated from the thought of the Unknown are real andpermanent beings, forms, and ideas; on earth, we see but their reflections; moreor less correct, and ever dependent on the physical and mental organization ofthe person who beholds them. Ages untold before our era, the Hindu Mystic Kapila, who is considered by manyscientists as a skeptic, because they judge him with their habitualsuperficiality, magnificently expressed this idea in the following terms: \"Man (physical man) counts for so little, that hardly anything can demonstrateto him his proper existence and that of nature. Perhaps, that which we regard asthe universe, and the divers beings which seem to compose it, have nothing real,and are but the product of continued illusion--maya--of our senses.\" And the modern Schopenhauer, repeating this philosophical idea, 10,000 years oldnow, says: \"Nature is non-existent, per se. . . . Nature is the infiniteillusion of our senses.\" Kant, Schelling, and other metaphysicians have said thesame, and their school maintains the idea. The objects of sense being everdelusive and fluctuating, cannot be a reality. Spirit alone is unchangeable,hence--alone is no illusion. This is pure Buddhist doctrine. The religion of theGnosis (knowledge), the most evident offshoot of Buddhism, was utterly based onthis metaphysical tenet. Christos suffered spiritually for us, and far moreacutely than did the illusionary Jesus while his body was being tortured on theCross. In the ideas of the Christians, Christ is but another name for Jesus. Thephilosophy of the Gnostics, the initiates, and hierophants understood itotherwise. The word Christos, Χριστοσ, like all Greek words, must be sought inits philological origin--the Sanscrit. In this latter language Kris meanssacred, * and the Hindu deity was named Chris-na (the pure or the sacred) fromthat. On the other hand, the Greek Christos bears several meanings, as anointed(pure oil, chrism) and others. In all languages, though the synonym of the wordmeans pure or sacred essence, it is the first emanation of the invisibleGodhead, manifesting itself tangibly in spirit. The Greek Logos, the HebrewMessiah, the Latin Verbum, and the Hindu Viradj (the son) are identically thesame; they represent an idea of collective entities--of flames detached from theone eternal centre of light. \"The man who accomplishes pious but interested acts (with the sole object of hissalvation) may reach the ranks of the devas (saints); *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu102.htm#fn_268] but he who accomplishes,disinterestedly, the same pious acts, finds himself ridden forever of the fiveelements\" (of matter). \"Perceiving the Supreme Soul in all beings and all beingsin the Supreme Soul, in offering his own soul in sacrifice, he identifieshimself with the Being who shines in his own splendor\" (Manu, book xii., slokas90, 91). Thus, Christos, as a unity, is but an abstraction: a general idea representingthe collective aggregation of the numberless spirit-entities, which are thedirect emanations of the infinite, invisible, incomprehensible FIRST CAUSE--theindividual spirits of men, erroneously called the souls. They are the divinesons of God, of which some only overshadow mortal men--but this themajority--some remain forever planetary spirits, and some--the smaller and rareminority--unite themselves during life with some men. Such God-like beings asGautama-Buddha, Jesus, Tissoo, Christna, and a few others had united themselveswith their spirits permanently--hence, they became gods on earth. Others, suchas Moses, Pythagoras, Apollonius, Plotinus, Confucius, Plato, Iamblichus, andsome Christian saints, having at intervals been so united, have taken rank inhistory as demi-gods and leaders of mankind. When unburthened of theirterrestrial tabernacles, their freed souls, henceforth united forever with theirspirits, rejoin the whole shining host, which is bound together in one spiritualsolidarity of thought and deed, and called \"the anointed.\" Hence, the meaning ofthe Gnostics, who, by saying that \"Christos\" suffered spiritually for humanity,implied that his Divine Spirit suffered mostly. Such, and far more elevating were the ideas of Marcion, the great \"Heresiarch\"of the second century, as he is termed by his opponents. He came to Rome towardthe latter part of the half-century, from A.D. 139-142, according to Tertullian,Irenaeus, Clemens, and most of his modern commentators, such as Bunsen,Tischendorf, Westcott, and many others. Credner and Schleiermacher ** agree asto his high and irreproachable personal character, his pure religiousaspirations and elevated views. His influence must have been powerful, as wefind Epiphanius writing more than two centuries later that in his time thefollowers of Marcion were to be found throughout the whole world. * The danger must have been pressing and great indeed, if we are to judge it tohave been proportioned with the opprobrious epithets and vituperation heapedupon Marcion by the \"Great African,\" that Patristic Cerberus, whom we find everbarking at the door of the Irenaean dogmas. ** We have but to open hiscelebrated refutation of Marcion's Antitheses, to acquaint ourselves with thefine-fleur of monkish abuse of the Christian school; an abuse so faithfullycarried through the middle ages, to be renewed again in our present day--at theVatican. \"Now, then, ye hounds, yelping at the God of Truth, whom the apostlescast out, to all your questions. These are the bones of contention which yegnaw,\" etc. *** \"The poverty of the Great African's arguments keeps pace withhis abuse,\" remarks the author of Supernatural Religion. **** \"Their (theFather's) religious controversy bristles with misstatements, and is turbid withpious abuse. Tertullian was a master of his style, and the vehement vituperationwith which he opens and often interlards his work against 'the impious andsacrilegious Marcion,' offers anything but a guarantee of fair and legitimatecriticism.\" How firm these two Fathers--Tertullian and Epiphanius--were on their theologicalground, may be inferred from the curious fact that they intemperately bothvehemently reproach \"the beast\" (Marcion) \"with erasing passages from the Gospelof Luke which never were in Luke at all.\" ***** \"The lightness and inaccuracy,\"adds the critic, \"with which Tertullian proceeds, are all the better illustratedby the fact that not only does he accuse Marcion falsely, but he actuallydefines the motives for which he expunged a passage which never existed; in thesame chapter he also similarly accuses Marcion of erasing (from Luke) the sayingthat Christ had not come to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfillthem, and he actually repeats the charge on two other occasions. ******Epiphanius also commits the mistake of reproaching Marcion with omitting fromLuke what is only found in Matthew.\" ******* Having so far shown the amount of reliance to be placed in the Patristicliterature, and it being unanimously conceded by the great majority of biblicalcritics that what the Fathers fought for was not truth, but their owninterpretations and unwarranted assertions, ******** we will now proceed tostate what were the views of Marcion, whom Tertullian desired to annihilate asthe most dangerous heretic of his day. If we are to believe Hilgenfeld, one ofthe greatest German biblical critics, then \"From the critical standing-point onemust . . . consider the statements of the Fathers of the Church only asexpressions of their subjective view, which itself requires proof.\" * We can do no better nor make a more correct statement of facts concerningMarcion than by quoting what our space permits from Supernatural Religion, theauthor of which bases his assertions on the evidence of the greatest critics, aswell as on his own researches. He shows in the days of Marcion \"two broadparties in the primitive Church\"--one considering Christianity \"a merecontinuation of the law, and dwarfing it into an Israelitish institution, anarrow sect of Judaism\"; the other representing the glad tidings \"as theintroduction of a new system, applicable to all, and supplanting the Mosaicdispensation of the law by a universal dispensation of grace.\" These twoparties, he adds, \"were popularly represented in the early Church, by the twoapostles Peter and Paul, and their antagonism is faintly revealed in the Epistleto the Galatians.\" ** Marcion, who recognised no other Gospels than a few Epistles of Paul, whorejected totally the anthropomorphism of the Old Testament, and drew a distinctline of demarcation between the old Judaism and Christianity, viewed Jesusneither as a King, Messiah of the Jews, nor the son of David, who was in any wayconnected with the law or prophets, \"but, a divine being sent to reveal to man aspiritual religion, wholly new, and a God of goodness and grace hithertounknown.\" The \"Lord God\" of the Jews in his eyes, the Creator (Demiurgos), wastotally different and distinct from the Deity who sent Jesus to reveal thedivine truth and preach the glad tidings, to bring reconciliation and salvationto all. The mission of Jesus--according to Marcion--was to abrogate the Jewish\"Lord,\" who \"was opposed to the God and Father of Jesus Christ as matter is tospirit, impurity to purity.\" Was Marcion so far wrong? Was it blasphemy, or was it intuition, divineinspiration in him to express that which every honest heart yearning for truth,more or less feels and acknowledges? If in his sincere desire to establish apurely spiritual religion, a universal faith based on unadulterated truth, hefound it necessary to make of Christianity an entirely new and separate systemfrom that of Judaism, did not Marcion have the very words of Christ for hisauthority? \"No man putteth a piece of new cloth into an old garment . . . forthe rent is made worse. . . . Neither do men put new wine into old bottles, elsethe bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish; but theyput new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.\" In what particular doesthe jealous, wrathful, revengeful God of Israel resemble the unknown deity, theGod of mercy preached by Jesus;--his Father who is in Heaven, and the Father ofall humanity? This Father alone is the God of spirit and purity, and, to compareHim with the subordinate and capricious Sinaitic Deity is an error. Did Jesusever pronounce the name of Jehovah? Did he ever place his Father in contrastwith this severe and cruel Judge; his God of mercy, love, and justice, with theJewish genius of retaliation? Never! From that memorable day when he preachedhis Sermon on the Mount, an immeasurable void opened between his God and thatother deity who fulminated his commands from that other mount--Sinai. Thelanguage of Jesus is unequivocal; it implies not only rebellion but defiance ofthe Mosaic \"Lord God.\" \"Ye have heard,\" he tells us, \"that it hath been said, aneye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist notevil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the otheralso. Ye have heard that it hath been said [by the same \"Lord God\" on Sinai]:Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you; Loveyour enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and prayfor them which despitefully use you, and persecute you\" (Matthew v.). And now, open Manu and read: \"Resignation, the action of rendering good for evil, temperance, probity,purity, repression of the senses, the knowledge of the Sastras (the holy books),that of the supreme soul, truthfulness and abstinence from anger, such are theten virtues in which consists duty. . . . Those who study these ten precepts ofduty, and after having studied them conform their lives thereto, will reach tothe supreme condition\" (Manu, book vi., sloka 92). If Manu did not trace these words many thousands of years before the era ofChristianity, at least no voice in the whole world will dare deny them a lessantiquity than several centuries B.C. The same in the case of the precepts ofBuddhism. If we turn to the Pratimokska Sutra and other religious tracts of the Buddhists,we read the ten following commandments: 1. Thou shalt not kill any living creature.2. Thou shalt not steal.3. Thou shalt not break thy vow of chastity.4. Thou shalt not lie.5. Thou shalt not betray the secrets of others.6. Thou shalt not wish for the death of thy enemies.7. Thou shalt not desire the wealth of others.8. Thou shalt not pronounce injurious and foul words.9. Thou shalt not indulge in luxury (sleep on soft beds or be lazy).10. Thou shalt not accept gold or silver. * \"Good master, what shall I do that I may have eternal life?\" asks a man ofJesus. \"Keep the commandments.\" \"Which?\" \"Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shaltnot commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear falsewitness,\" ** is the answer. \"What shall I do to obtain possession of Bhodi? (knowledge of eternal truth)\"asks a disciple of his Buddhist master. \"What way is there to become anUpasaka?\" \"Keep the commandments.\" \"What are they?\" \"Thou shalt abstain all thylife from murder, theft, adultery, and lying,\" answers the master. *** Identical injunctions are they not? Divine injunctions, the living up to whichwould purify and exalt humanity. But are they more divine when uttered throughone mouth than another? If it is god-like to return good for evil, does theenunciation of the precept by a Nazarene give it any greater force than itsenunciation by an Indian, or Thibetan philosopher? We see that the Golden Rulewas not original with Jesus; that its birth-place was India. Do what we may, wecannot deny Sakya-Muni Buddha a less remote antiquity than several centuriesbefore the birth of Jesus. In seeking a model for his system of ethics whyshould Jesus have gone to the foot of the Himalayas rather than to the foot ofSinai, but that the doctrines of Manu and Gautarna harmonized exactly with hisown philosophy, while those of Jehovah were to him abhorrent and terrifying? TheHindus taught to return good for evil, but the Jehovistic command was: \"An eyefor an eye\" and \"a tooth for a tooth.\" Would Christians still maintain the identity of the \"Father\" of Jesus andJehovah, if evidence sufficiently clear could be adduced that the \"Lord God\" wasno other than the Pagan Bacchus, Dionysos? Well, this identity of the Jehovah atMount Sinai with the god Bacchus is hardly disputable. The name[images/00024.jpg]is Yava or Iao, according to Theodoret, which is the secretname of the Phoenician Mystery-god; * and it was actually adopted from theChaldeans with whom it also was the secret name of the creator. Wherever Bacchuswas worshipped there was a tradition of Nysa and a cave where he was reared.Beth-San or Scythopolis in Palestine had that designation; so had a spot onMount Parnassus. But Diodorus declares that Nysa was between Phoenicia andEgypt; Euripides states that Dionysos came to Greece from India; and Diodorusadds his testimony: \"Osiris was brought up in Nysa, in Arabia the Happy; he wasthe son of Zeus, and was named from his father (nominative Zeus, genitive Dios)and the place Dio-Nysos\"--the Zeus or Jove of Nysa. This identity of name ortitle is very significant. In Greece Dionysos was second only to Zeus, andPindar says: \"So Father Zeus governs all things, and Bacchus he governs also.\"But outside of Greece Bacchus was the all-powerful \"Zagreus, the highest ofgods.\" Moses seems to have worshipped him personally and together with thepopulace at Mount Sinai; unless we admit that he was an initiated priest, anadept, who knew how to lift the veil which hangs behind all such exotericworship, but kept the secret. \"And Moses built an altar, and called the name ofit Jehovah-NISSI\"! or Iao-Nisi. What better evidence is required to show thatthe Sinaitic god was indifferently Bacchus, Osiris, and Jehovah? Mr. Sharpeappends also his testimony that the place where Osiris was born \"was MountSinai, called by the Egyptians Mount Nissa.\" The Brazen Serpent was a nis,[images/00034.jpg], and the month of the Jewish Passover nisan. If the Mosaic \"Lord God\" was the only living God, and Jesus His only Son, howaccount for the rebellious language of the latter? Without hesitation orqualification he sweeps away the Jewish lex talionis and substitutes for it thelaw of charity and self-denial. If the Old Testament is a divine revelation, howcan the New Testament be? Are we required to believe and worship a Deity whocontradicts himself every few hundred years? Was Moses inspired, or was Jesusnot the son of God? This is a dilemma from which the theologians are bond torescue us. It is from this very dilemma that the Gnostics endeavored to snatchthe budding Christianity. Justice has been waiting nineteen centuries for intelligent commentators toappreciate this difference between the orthodox Tertullian and the GnosticMarcion. The brutal violence, unfairness, and bigotry of the \"great African\"repulse all who accept his Christianity. \"How can a god,\" inquired Marcion,\"break his own commandments? How could he consistently prohibit idolatry andimage-worship, and still cause Moses to set up the brazen serpent? How command:Thou shalt not steal, and then order the Israelites to spoil the Egyptians oftheir gold and silver?\" Anticipating the results of modern criticism, Marciondenies the applicability to Jesus of the so-called Messianic prophecies. Writesthe author of Supernatural Religion: * \"The Emmanuel of Isaiah is not Christ;the 'Virgin,' his mother, is simply a 'young woman,' an alma of the temple; andthe sufferings of the servant of God (Isaiah lii. 13 - liii. 3) are notpredictions of the death of Jesus.\" ** [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES125:* \"The Christ of Paul,\" p. 123. 125:** Gospel according to Mark, viii. 33. 126:* \"Supernatural Religion,\" vol. ii., p. 489. 126:** \"Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism,\" p. 28. 126:*** See Eusebius, \"Ex.

The prevalent idea that the last of the Buddhas, Gautama, is the ninthincarnation of Vishnu, or the ninth Avatar, is disclaimed partially by theBrahmans, and wholly rejected by the learned Buddhist theologians. The latterinsist that the worship of Buddha possesses a far higher claim to antiquity thanany of the Brahmanical deities of the Vedas, which they call secular literature.The Brahmans, they show, came from other countries, and established their heresyon the already accepted popular deities. They conquered the land by the sword,and succeeded in burying truth, by building a theology of their own on the ruinsof the more ancient one of Buddha, which had prevailed for ages. They admit thedivinity and spiritual existence of some of the Vedantic gods; but as in thecase of the Christian angel-hierarchy they believe that all these deities aregreatly subordinate, even to the incarnated Buddhas. They do not evenacknowledge the creation of the physical universe. Spiritually and invisibly ithas existed from all eternity, and thus it was made merely visible to the humansenses. When it first appeared it was called forth from the realm of theinvisible into the visible by the impulse of A'di Buddha--the \"Essence.\" Theyreckon twenty-two such visible appearances of the universe governed by Buddhas,and as many destructions of it, by fire and water in regular successions. Afterthe last destruction by the flood, at the end of the precedent cycle--(the exactcalculation, embracing several millions of years, is a secret cycle) the world,during the present age of the Kali Yug--Maha Bhadda Calpa--has been ruledsuccessively by four Buddhas, the last of whom was Gautama, the \"Holy One.\" Thefifth, Maitree-Buddha, is yet to come. This latter is the expected kabalisticKing Messiah, the Messenger of Light, and Sosiosh, the Persian Saviour, who willcome on a white horse. It is also the Christian Second Advent.

In later times Marcionmight have been honored as a reformer, in his own he was denounced as a heretic.Austere and ascetic in his opinions, he aimed at superhuman purity, and,although his clerical adversaries might scoff at his impracticable doctrinesregarding marriage and the subjugation of the flesh, they have had theirparallels amongst those whom the Church has since most delighted to honor, and,at least, the whole tendency of his system was markedly towards the side ofvirtue.\" These statements are based upon Credner's \"Beitrage,\" i., p. 40; cf.Neander: \"Allg. K. G.,\" ii., p. 792, f.; Schleiermacher, Milman, etc., etc. 161:* Justin's \"Die Evv.,\" p. 446, sup. B. 161:**But, on the other hand, this antagonism is very strongly marked in the\"Clementine Homilies,\" in which Peter unequivocally denies that Paul, whom hecalls Simon the Magician, has ever had a vision of Christ, and calls him \"anenemy.\" Canon Westcott says: \"There can be no doubt that St. Paul is referred toas 'the enemy' \" (\"On the Canon,\" p. 252, note 2; \"Supernatural Religion,\" vol.ii., p. 35). But this antagonism, which rages unto the present day, we find evenin St. Paul's \"Epistles.\" What can be more energetic than such like sentences:\"Such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into theapostles of Christ. . . . I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefestapostle\" (2 Corinthians, xi.). \"Paul, an apostle not of men, neither by man, butby Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead . . . but therebe some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel p. 162 of Christ . . .false brethren. . . . When Peter came to Antioch I withstood him to his face,because he was to be blamed. For before that certain came from James, he did eatwith the Gentiles, but when they were come he withdrew, fearing them which wereof the circumcision. And the other Jews dissembled . . . insomuch that Barnabasalso was carried away with their dissimulation,\" etc., etc. (Galat. i and ii.).On the other hand, we find Peter in the \"Homilies,\" indulging in variouscomplaints which, although alleged to be addressed to Simon Magus, are evidentlyall direct answers to the above-quoted sentences from the Pauline Epistles, andcannot have anything to do with Simon. So, for instance, Peter said: \"For someamong the Gentiles have rejected my lawful preaching, and accepted certainlawless and foolish teaching of the hostile men (enemy)\"--Epist. of Peter toJames, § 2. He says further: \"Simon (Paul) . . . who came before me to theGentiles . . . and I have followed him as light upon darkness, as knowledge uponignorance, as health upon disease\" (\"Homil.,\" ii. 17). Still further, he callshim Death and a deceiver (Ibid., ii. 18). He warns the Gentiles that \"our Lordand Prophet (?) (Jesus) announced that he would send from among his followers,apostles to deceive. \"Therefore, above all, remember to avoid every apostle, orteacher, or prophet, who first does not accurately compare his teaching withthat of James, called the brother of our Lord\" (see the difference between Pauland James on faith, Epist. to Hebrews, xi., xii., and Epist. of James, ii.).\"Lest the Evil One should send a false preacher . . . as he has sent to us Simon(?) preaching a counterfeit of truth in the name of our Lord, and disseminatingerror\" (\"Hom.\" xi., 35; see above quotation from Gal. 1, 5). He then deniesPaul's assertion, in the following words: \"If, therefore, our Jesus indeedappeared in a vision to you, it was only as an irritated adversary. . . . Buthow can any one through visions become wise in teaching? And if you say, 'it ispossible,' then I ask, wherefore did the Teacher remain for a whole year anddiscourse to those who were attentive? And how can we believe your story that heappeared to you? And in what manner did he appear to you, when you hold opinionscontrary to his teaching? . . . For you now set yourself up against me, who am afirm rock, the foundation of the Church. If you were not an opponent, you wouldnot calumniate me, you would not revile my teaching . . . (circumcision?) inorder that, in declaring what I have myself heard from the Lord, I may not bebelieved, as though I were condemned. . . . But if you say that I am condemned,you blame God who revealed Christ to me.\" \"This last phrase,\" observes theauthor of \"Supernatural Religion,\" \" 'if you say that I am condemned,' is anevident allusion to Galat. ii, 11, 'I withstood him to the face, because he wascondemned' \" (\"Supernatural Religion,\" p. 37). \"There cannot be a doubt,\" addsthe just-quoted author, \"that the Apostle Paul is attacked in this religiousromance as the great enemy of the true faith, under the hated name of Simon theMagician, whom Peter follows everywhere for the purpose of unmasking andconfuting him\" (p. 34). And if so, then we must believe that it was St. Paul whobroke both his legs in Rome when flying in the air. 164:*\"Pratimoksha Sutra,\" Pali Burmese copy; see also \"Lotus de la Bonne Loi,\"translated by Burnouf, p. 444. 164:**Matthew xix. 16-18. 164:*** \"Pittakatayan,\" book iii., Pali Version. 165:*See Judges xiii. 18, \"And the angel of the Lord said unto him: Why askestthou after my name, seeing it is SECRET?\" 166:*Vol. ii., p. 106. 166:** Emmanuel was doubtless the son of the prophet himself, as described inthe sixth chapter; what was predicted, can only be interpreted on thathypothesis.

Assyria should be humbled, and peaceoverspread the Israelitish country, compare Isaiah vii. 14-16; viii. 3, 4; ix.6, 7; x. 12, 20, 21; xi.; Micah v., 2-7. The popular party, the party of theprophets, always opposed to the Zadokite priesthood, had resolved to set asideAhaz and his time-serving policy, which had let in Assyria upon Palestine, andto set up Hezekiah, a man of their own, who should rebel against Assyria andoverthrow the Assur-worship and Baalim (2 Kings xv. 11). Though only theprophets hint this, it being cut out from the historical books, it is noticeablethat Ahaz offered his own child to Moloch, also that he died at the age ofthirty-six, and Hezekiah took the throne at twenty-five, in full adult age.

Wellmight Josiah have rent his clothes when he had heard the words of the Book ofthe Law; for there was no more of Moses in it than there is of Jesus in theGospel according to John. We have one fair alternative to offer our theologians, leaving them to choosefor themselves, and promising to abide by their decision. Only they will have toadmit, either that Moses was an impostor, or that his books are forgeries,written at different times and by different persons; or, again, that they arefull of fraudulent interpolations. In either case the work loses all claims tobe considered divine Revelation. Here is the problem, which we quote from theBible--the word of the God of Truth: \"And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of GodAlmighty, but by my name of JEHOVAH was I not known to them\" (Exodus vi. 3),spake God unto Moses. A very startling bit of information that, when, before arriving at the book ofExodus, we are told in Genesis (xxii. 14) that \"Abraham called the name of thatplace\"--where the patriarch had been preparing to cut the throat of hisonly-begotten son--\"JEHOVAH-jireh\"! (Jehovah sees.) Which is the inspiredtext?--both cannot be--which the forgery? Now, if both Abraham and Moses had not belonged to the same holy group, wemight, perhaps, help theologians by suggesting to them a convenient means ofescape out of this dilemma. They ought to call the reverend JesuitFathers--especially those who have been missionaries in India--to their rescue.The latter would not be for a moment disconcerted. They would coolly tell usthat beyond doubt Abraham had heard the name of Jehovah and borrowed it fromMoses. Do they not maintain that it was they who invented the Sanscrit, editedManu, and composed the greater portion of the Vedas? Marcion maintained, with the other Gnostics, the fallaciousness of the idea ofan incarnate God, and therefore denied the corporeal reality of the living bodyof Christ. His entity was a mere illusion; it was not made of human flesh andblood, neither was it born of a human mother, for his divine nature could not bepolluted with any contact with sinful flesh. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_286] He accepted Paul as theonly apostle preaching the pure gospel of truth, and accused the other disciplesof \"depraving the pure form of the gospel doctrines delivered to them by Jesus,mixing up matters of the Law with the words of the Saviour.\" ** Finally we may add that modern biblical criticism, which unfortunately becamereally active and serious only toward the end of the last century, now generallyadmits that Marcion's text of the only gospel he knew anything about--that ofLuke, is far superior and by far more correct than that of our presentSynoptics. We find in Supernatural Religion the following (for every Christian)startling sentence: \"We are, therefore, indebted to Marcion for the correctversion even of 'the Lord's Prayer.' \" *** If, leaving for the present the prominent founders of Christian sects, we nowturn to that of the Ophites, which assumed a definite form about the time ofMarcion and the Basilideans, we may find in it the reason for the heresies ofall others. Like all other Gnostics, they rejected the Mosaic Bible entirely.Nevertheless, their philosophy, apart from some deductions original with severalof the most important founders of the various branches of Gnosticism was notnew. Passing through the Chaldean kabalistic tradition, it gathered itsmaterials in the Hermetic books, and pursuing its flight still farther back forits metaphysical speculations, we find it floundering among the tenets of Manu,and the earliest Hindu ante-sacerdotal genesis. Many of our eminent antiquarianstrace the Gnostic philosophies right back to Buddhism, which does not impair inthe least either their or our arguments. We repeat again, Buddhism is but theprimitive source of Brahmanism. It is not against the primitive Vedas thatGautama protests. It is against the sacerdotal and official state religion ofhis country; and the Brahmans, who in order to make room for and give authorityto the castes, at a later period crammed the ancient manuscripts withinterpolated slokas, intended to prove that the castes were predetermined by theCreator by the very fact that each class of men was issued from a more or lessnoble limb of Brahma. Gautama-Buddha's philosophy was that taught from thebeginning of time in the impenetrable secresy of the inner sanctuaries of thepagodas. We need not be surprised, therefore, to find again, in all thefundamental dogmas of the Gnostics, the metaphysical tenets of both Brahmanismand Buddhism. They held that the Old Testament was the revelation of an inferiorbeing, a subordinate divinity, and did not contain a single sentence of theirSophia, the Divine Wisdom. As to the New Testament, it had lost its purity whenthe compilers became guilty of interpolations. The revelation of divine truthwas sacrificed by them to promote selfish ends and maintain quarrels. Theaccusation does not seem so very improbable to one who is well aware of theconstant strife between the champions of circumcision and the \"Law,\" and theapostles who had given up Judaism. The Gnostic Ophites taught the doctrine of Emanations, so hateful to thedefenders of the unity in the trinity, and vice versa. The Unknown Deity withthem had no name; but his first female emanation was called Bythos or Depth. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_289] It answered to theShekinah of the kabalists, the \"Veil\" which conceals the \"Wisdom\" in the craniumof the highest of the three heads. As the Pythagorean Monad, this namelessWisdom was the Source of Light, and Ennoia or Mind, is Light itself. The latterwas also called the \"Primitive Man,\" like the Adam Kadmon, or ancient Adam ofthe Kabala. Indeed, if man was created after his likeness and in the image ofGod, then this God was like his creature in shape and figure--hence, he is the\"Primitive man.\" The first Manu, the one evolved from Swayambhuva, \"he whoexists unrevealed in his own glory,\" is also, in one sense, the primitive man,with the Hindus. Thus the \"nameless and the unrevealed,\" Bythos, his female reflection, andEnnoia, the revealed Mind proceeding from both, or their Son are thecounterparts of the Chaldean first triad as well as those of the BrahmanicTrimurti. We will compare: in all the three systems we see THE GREAT FIRST CAUSEas the ONE, the primordial germ, the unrevealed and grand ALL, existing throughhimself. In the INDIAN PANTHEON. Brahma-Zyaus.THE CHALDEAN. Ilu, Kabalistic En-Soph.IN THE OPHITE. The Nameless, or Secret Name.Whenever the Eternal awakes from its slumber and desires to manifest itself, itdivides itself into male and female. It then becomes in every system THE DOUBLE-SEXED DEITY, The universal Father and Mother.IN INDIA. Brahma. Nara (male), Nari (female).IN CHALDEA. Eikon or En-Soph. Anu (male), Anata (female).IN THE OPHITE SYSTEM. Nameless Spirit. Abrasax (male), Bythos (female).From the union of the two emanates a third, or creative Principle--the SON, orthe manifested Logos, the product of the Divine Mind. IN INDIA. Viradj, the Son.IN CHALDEA. Bel, the Son.OPHITE SYSTEM. Ophis (another name for Ennoia), the Son.Moreover, each of these systems has a triple male trinity, each proceedingseparately through itself from one female Deity. So, for instance: IN INDIA. The Trinity--Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, are blended into ONE, who is Brahma(neuter gender), creating and being created through the Virgin Nari (the motherof perpetual fecundity).IN CHALDEA. The trinity--Anu, Bel, Hoa (or Sin, Samas, Bin), blend into ONE whois Anu (double-sexed) through the Virgin Mylitta.IN THE OPHITE SYSTEM. The trinity consisted of the Mystery named Sige, Bythos,Ennoia. These become ONE who is Abrasax, from the Virgin Sophia (or Pneuma), whoherself is an emanation of Bythos and the Mystery-god and emanates through them,Christos.To place it still clearer, the Babylonian System recognizes first--the ONE (Ad,or Ad-ad), who is never named, but only acknowledged in thought as the HinduSwayambhuva. From this he becomes manifest as Anu or Ana--the one aboveall--Monas. Next comes the Demiurge called Bel or Elu, who is the active powerof the Godhead. The third is the principle of Wisdom, Hea or Hoa, who also rulesthe sea and the underworld. Each of these has his divine consort, giving usAnata, Belta, and Davkina. These, however, are only like the Saktis, and notespecially remarked by theologists. But the female principle is denoted byMylitta, the Great Mother, called also Ishtar. So with the three male gods, wehave the Triad or Trimurti, and with Mylitta added, the Arba or Four (Tetraktysof Pythagoras), which perfects and potentializes all. Hence, the above-givenmodes of expression. The following Chaldean diagram may serve as an illustrationfor all others: Triad / Anu, Bel, Hoa. / Mylitta--Arba-il, or Four-fold God, become, with the Christians, Trinity / God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, / Mary, or mother ofthese three Gods since they are one, or, the Christian Heavenly Tetraktys. Hence, Hebron, the city of the Kabeiri was called Kirjath-Arba, city of theFour. The Kabeiri were Axieros--the noble Eros, Axiokersos, the worthy hornedone, Axiokersa, Demeter and Kadmiel, Hoa, etc. The Pythagorean ten denoted the Arba-Il or Divine Four, emblematized by theHindu Lingham: Anu, 1; Bel, 2; Hoa, 3, which makes 6. The triad and Mylitta as 4make the ten. Though he is termed the \"Primitive Man,\" Ennoia, who is like the EgyptianPimander, the \"Power of the Thought Divine,\" the first intelligiblemanifestation of the Divine Spirit in material form, he is like the\"Only-Begotten\" Son of the \"Unknown Father,\" of all other nations. He is theemblem of the first appearance of the divine Presence in his own works ofcreation, tangible and visible, and therefore comprehensible. The mystery-God,or the ever-unrevealed Deity fecundates through His will Bythos, theunfathomable and infinite depth that exists in silence (Sige) and darkness (forour intellect), and that represents the abstract idea of all nature, theever-producing Cosmos. As neither the male nor female principle, blended intothe idea of a double-sexed Deity in ancient conceptions, could be comprehendedby an ordinary human intellect, the theology of every people had to create forits religion a Logos, or manifested word, in some shape or other. With theOphites and other Gnostics who took their models direct from more ancientoriginals, the unrevealed Bythos and her male counterpart produce Ennoia, andthe three in their turn produce Sophia, * thus completing the Tetraktys, whichwill emanate Christos, the very essence of the Father Spirit. As the unrevealedOne, or concealed Logos in its latent state, he has existed from all eternity inthe Arba-Il, the metaphysical abstraction; therefore, he is ONE with all othersas a unity, the latter (including all) being indifferently termed Ennoia, Sige(silence), Bythos, etc. As the revealed one, he is Androgyne, Christos, andSophia (Divine Wisdom), who descend into the man Jesus. Both Father and Son areshown by Irenaeus to have loved the beauty (formam) of the primitive woman, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_291] who is Bythos--Depth--aswell as Sophia, and as having produced conjointly Ophis and Sophia (double-sexedunity again), male and female wisdom, one being considered as the unrevealedHoly Spirit, or elder Sophia--the Pneuma--the intellectual \"Mother of allthings\"; the other the revealed one, or Ophis, typifying divine wisdom falleninto matter, or God-man--Jesus, whom the Gnostic Ophites represented by theserpent (Ophis). Fecundated by the Divine Light of the Father and Son, the highest spirit andEnnoia, Sophia produces in her turn two other emanations--one perfect Christos,the second imperfect Sophia-Achamoth, ** from [images/00035.jpg]hakhamoth(simple wisdom), who becomes the mediatrix between the intellectual and materialworlds. Christos was the mediator and guide between God (the Higher), and everythingspiritual in man; Achamoth--the younger Sophia--held the same duty between the\"Primitive man,\" Ennoia and matter. What was mysteriously meant by the generalterm, Christos, we have just explained. Delivering a sermon on the \"Month of Mary,\" we find the Rev. Dr. Preston, of NewYork City, expressing the Christian idea of the female principle of the trinitybetter and more clearly than we could, and substantially in the spirit of anancient \"heathen\" philosopher. He says that the \"plan of the redemption made itnecessary that a mother should be found, and Mary stands pre-eminently alone asthe only instance when a creature was necessary to the consummation of God'swork.\" We will beg the right to contradict the reverend gentleman. As shownabove, thousands of years before our era it was found necessary by all the\"heathen\" theogonies to find a female principle, a \"mother\" for the triune maleprinciple. Hence, Christianity does not present the \"only instance\" of such aconsummation of God's work--albeit, as this work shows, there was morephilosophy and less materialism, or rather anthropomorphism, in it. But hear thereverend Doctor express \"heathen\" thought in Christian ideas. \"He\" (God), hesays, \"prepared her (Mary's) virginal and celestial purity, for a mother defiledcould not become the mother of the Most High. The holy virgin, even in herchildhood, was more pleasing than all the Cherubim and Seraphim, and frominfancy to the maturing maidenhood and womanhood she grew more and more pure. Byher very sanctity she reigned over the heart of God. When the hour came, thewhole court of heaven was hushed, and the trinity listened for the answer ofMary, for without her consent the world could not have been redeemed.\" Does it not seem as if we were reading Irenaeus explaining the Gnostic \"Heresy,which taught that the Father and Son loved the beauty (formam) of the celestialVirgin\"? or the Egyptian system, of Isis being both wife, sister, and mother ofOsiris-Horus? With the Gnostic philosophy there were but two, but the Christianshave improved and perfected the system by making it completely \"heathen,\" for itis the Chaldean Anu--Bel--Hoa, merging into Mylitta. \"Then while this month (ofMary),\" adds Dr. Preston, \"begins in the paschal season--the month when naturedecks herself with fruits and flowers, the harbingers of a bright harvest--letus, too, begin for a golden harvest. In this month the dead come up out of theearth, figuring the resurrection; so, when we are kneeling before the altar ofthe holy and immaculate Mary, let us remember that there should come forth fromus the bud of promise, the flower of hope, and the imperishable fruit ofsanctity.\" This is precisely the substratum of the Pagan thought, which, among othermeanings, emblematized by the rites of the resurrection of Osiris, Adonis,Bacchus, and other slaughtered sun-gods, the resurrection of all nature inspring, the germination of seeds that had been dead and sleeping during winter,and so were allegorically said to be kept in the underworld (Hades). They aretypified by the three days passed in hell before his resurrection by Hercules,by Christ, and others. This derivation, or rather heresy, as it is called in Christianity, is simplythe Brahmanic doctrine in all its archaic purity. Vishnu, the second personageof the Hindu trinity, is also the Logos, for he is made subsequently toincarnate himself in Christna. And Lakmy (or Lakshmy) who, as in the case ofOsiris and Isis, of En-Soph and Sephira, and of Bythos and Ennoia, is both hiswife, sister, and daughter, through this endless correlation of male and femalecreative powers in the abstruse metaphysics of the ancient philosophies--isSophia-Achamoth. Christna is the mediator promised by Brahma to mankind, andrepresents the same idea as the Gnostic Christos. And Lakmy, Vishnu's spiritualhalf, is the emblem of physical nature, the universal mother of all the materialand revealed forms; the mediatrix and protector of nature, like Sophia-Achamoth,who is made by the Gnostics the mediatrix between the Great Cause and Matter, asChristos is the mediator between him and spiritual humanity. This Brahmano-Gnostic tenet is more logical, and more consistent with theallegory of Genesis and the fall of man. When God curses the first couple, He ismade to curse also the earth and everything that is on it. The New Testamentgives us a Redeemer for the first sin of mankind, which was punished for havingsinned; but there is not a word said about a Saviour who would take off theunmerited curse from the earth and the animals, which had never sinned at all.Thus the Gnostic allegory shows a greater sense of both justice and logic thanthe Christian. In the Ophite system, Sophia, the Androgyne Wisdom, is also the female spirit,or the Hindu female Nari (Narayana), moving on the face of the waters--chaos, orfuture matter. She vivifies it from afar, but not touching the abyss ofdarkness. She is unable to do so, for Wisdom is purely intellectual, and cannotact directly on matter. Therefore, Sophia is obliged to address herself to herSupreme Parent; but although life proceeds primally from the Unseen Cause, andhis Ennoia, neither of them can, any more than herself, have anything to do withthe lower chaos in which matter assumes its definite shape. Thus, Sophia isobliged to employ on the task her imperfect emanation, Sophia-Achamoth, thelatter being of a mixed nature, half spiritual and half material. The only difference between the Ophite cosmogony and that of the St. JohnNazarenes is a change of names. We find equally an identical system in theKabala, the Book of Mystery (Liber Mysterii). *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_293] All the three systems,especially that of the kabalists and the Nazarenes, which were the models forthe Ophite Cosmogony, belong to the pure Oriental Gnosticism. The CodexNazaraeus opens with: \"The Supreme King of Light, Mano, the great first one,\" **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_294] etc., the latter being theemanation of Ferho--the unknown, formless LIFE. He is the chief of the Æons,from whom proceed (or shoot forth) five refulgent rays of Divine light. Mano isRex Lucis, the Bythos-Ennoia of the Ophites. \"Unus est Rex Lucis in suo regno,nec ullus qui eo altior, nullus qui ejus similitudinem retulerit, nullus quisublatis oculis, viderit Coronam quae in ejus capite est.\" He is the ManifestedLight around the highest of the three kabalistic heads, the concealed wisdom;from him emanate the three Lives. Æbel Zivo is the revealed Logos, Christos the\"Apostle Gabriel,\" and the first Legate or messenger of light. If Bythos andEnnoia are the Nazarene Mano, then the dual-natured, the semi-spiritual,semi-material Achamoth must be Fetahil when viewed from her spiritual aspect;and if regarded in her grosser nature, she is the Nazarene \"Spiritus.\" Fetahil, *who is the reflection of his father, Lord Abatur, the third life--asthe elder Sophia is also the third emanation--is the \"newest-man.\" Perceivinghis fruitless attempts to create a perfect material world, the \"Spiritus\" callsto one of her progeny, the Karabtanos--Ilda-Baoth--who is without sense orjudgment (\"blind matter\"), to unite himself with her to create somethingdefinite out of this confused (turbulentos) matter, which task she is enabled toachieve only after having produced from this union with Karabtanos the sevenstellars. Like the six sons or genii of the Gnostic Ilda-Baoth, they then framethe material world. The same story is repeated over again in Sophia-Achamoth.Delegated by her purely spiritual parent, the elder Sophia, to create the worldof visible forms, she descended into chaos, and, overpowered by the emanation ofmatter, lost her way. Still ambitious to create a world of matter of her own,she busied herself hovering to and fro about the dark abyss, and imparted lifeand motion to the inert elements, until she became so hopelessly entangled inmatter that, like Fetahil, she is represented sitting immersed in mud, andunable to extricate herself from it; until, by the contact of matter itself, sheproduces the Creator of the material world. He is the Demiurgus, called by theOphites Ilda-Baoth, and, as we will directly show, the parent of the Jewish Godin the opinion of some sects, and held by others to be the \"Lord God\" Himself.It is at this point of the kabalistic-gnostic cosmogony that begins the MosaicBible. Having accepted the Jewish Old Testament as their standard, no wonderthat the Christians were forced by the exceptional position in which they wereplaced through their own ignorance, to make the best of it. The first groups of Christians, whom Renan shows numbering but from seven totwelve men in each church, belonged unquestionably to the poorest and mostignorant classes. They had and could have no idea of the highly philosophicaldoctrines of the Platonists and Gnostics, and evidently knew as little abouttheir own newly-made-up religion. To these, who if Jews, had been crushed underthe tyrannical dominion of the \"law,\" as enforced by the elders of thesynagogues, and if Pagans had been always excluded, as the lower castes areuntil now in India, from the religious mysteries, the God of the Jews and the\"Father\" preached by Jesus were all one. The contentions which reigned from thefirst years following the death of Jesus, between the two parties, the Paulineand the Petrine--were deplorable. What one did, the other deemed a sacred dutyto undo. If the Homilies are considered apocryphal, and cannot very well beaccepted as an infallible standard by which to measure the animosity which ragedbetween the two apostles, we have the Bible, and the proofs afforded therein areplentiful. So hopelessly entangled seems Irenaeus in his fruitless endeavors to describe,to all outward appearance at least, the true doctrines of the many Gnostic sectsof which he treats and to present them at the same time as abominable\"heresies,\" that he either deliberately, or through ignorance, confounds all ofthem in such a way that few metaphysicians would be able to disentangle them,without the Kabala and the Codex as the true keys. Thus, for instance, he cannoteven tell the difference between the Sethianites and the Ophites, and tells usthat they called the \"God of all,\" \"Hominem,\" a MAN, and his mind the SECONDman, or the \"Son of man.\" So does Theodoret, who lived more than two centuriesafter Irenaeus, and who makes a sad mess of the chronological order in which thevarious sects succeeded each other. *Neither the Sethianites, (a branch of theJewish Nazarenes) nor the Ophites, a purely Greek sect, have ever held anythingof the kind. Irenaeus contradicts his own words by describing in another placethe doctrines of Cerinthus, the direct disciple of Simon Magus. He says thatCerinthus taught that the world was not created by the FIRST GOD, but by avirtue (virtus) or power, an Æon so distant from the First Cause that he waseven ignorant of HIM who is above all things. This Æon subjected Jesus, he begothim physically through Joseph from one who was not a virgin, but simply the wifeof that Joseph, and Jesus was born like all other men. Viewed from this physicalaspect of his nature, Jesus was called the \"son of man.\" It is only after hisbaptism, that Christos, the anointed, descended from the Princeliness of above,in the figure of a dove, and then announced the UNKNOWN Father through Jesus. ** If, therefore, Jesus was physically considered as a son of man, and spirituallyas the Christos, who overshadowed him, how then could the \"GOD OF ALL,\" the\"Unknown Father,\" be called by the Gnostics Homo, a MAN, and his Mind, Ennoia,the SECOND man, or Son of man? Neither in the Oriental Kabala, nor inGnosticism, was the \"God of all\" ever anthropomorphized. It is but the first, orrather the second emanations, for Shekinah, Sephira, Depth, and otherfirst-manifested female virtues are also emanations, that are termed \"primitivemen.\" Thus Adam Kadmon, Ennoia (or Sige), the logoi in short, are the\"only-begotten\" ones but not the Sons of man, which appellation properly belongsto Christos the son of Sophia (the elder) and of the primitive man who produceshim through his own vivifying light, which emanates from the source or cause ofall, hence the cause of his light also, the \"Unknown Father.\" There is a greatdifference made in the Gnostic metaphysics between the first unrevealed Logosand the \"anointed,\" who is Christos. Ennoia may be termed, as Philo understandsit, the Second God, but he alone is the \"Primitive and First man,\" and by nomeans the Second one, as Theodoret and Irenaeus have it. It is but theinveterate desire of the latter to connect Jesus in every possible way, even inthe Haeresies, with the Highest God, that led him into so many falsifications. Such an identification with the Unknown God, even of Christos, the anointed--theÆon who overshadowed him--let alone of the man Jesus, never entered the head ofthe Gnostics nor even of the direct apostles and of Paul, whatever laterforgeries may have added. How daring and desperate were many such deliberate falsifications was shown inthe first attempts to compare the original manuscripts with later ones. InBishop Horseley's edition of Sir Isaac Newton's works, several manuscripts ontheological subjects were cautiously withheld from publication. The articleknown as Christ's Descent into Hell, which is found in the later Apostles'Creed, is not to be found in the manuscripts of either the fourth or sixthcenturies. It was an evident interpolation copied from the fables of Bacchus andHercules and enforced upon Christendom as an article of faith. Concerning it theauthor of the preface to the Catalogue of the Manuscripts of the King's Library(preface, p. xxi.) remarks: \"I wish that the insertion of the article ofChrist's Descent into Hell into the Apostles' Creed could be as well accountedfor as the insertion of the said verse\" (First Epistle of John, v. 7). * Now, this verse reads: \"For there are three that bear record in Heaven, theFather, the Word and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one.\" This verse, whichhas been \"appointed to be read in churches,\" is now known to be spurious. It isnot to be found in any Greek manuscript,\" save one at Berlin, which wastranscribed from some interpolated paraphrase between the lines. In the firstand second editions of Erasmus, printed in 1516 and 1519, this allusion to thesethree heavenly witnesses is omitted; and the text is not contained in any Greekmanuscript which was written earlier than the fifteenth century. ** It was notmentioned by either of the Greek ecclesiastical writers nor by the early Latinfathers, so anxious to get at every proof in support of their trinity; and itwas omitted by Luther in his German version. Edward Gibbon was early in pointingout its spurious character. Archbishop Newcome rejected it, and the Bishop ofLincoln expresses his conviction that it is spurious. * There are twenty-eightGreek authors--Irenaeus, Clemens, and Athanasius included, who neither quote normention it; and seventeen Latin writers, numbering among them Augustine, Jerome,Ambrosius, Cyprian, and Pope Eusebius, who appear utterly ignorant of it. \"It isevident that if the text of the heavenly witnesses had been known from thebeginning of Christianity the ancients would have eagerly seized it, inserted itin their creeds, quoted it repeatedly against the heretics, and selected it forthe brightest ornament of every book that they wrote upon the subject of theTrinity.\" ** Thus falls to the ground the strongest trinitarian pillar. Another not lessobvious forgery is quoted from Sir Isaac Newton's words by the editor of theApocryphal New Testament. Newton observes \"that what the Latins have done tothis text (First Epistle of John, v.), the Greeks have done to that of St. Paul(Timothy iii. 16). For, by changing ο into θ, the abbreviation of θεοσ (God), inthe Alexandrian manuscript, from which their subsequent copies were made, theynow read, \"Great is the mystery of godliness, GOD manifested in the flesh\";whereas all the churches, for the first four or five centuries, and the authorsof all the ancient versions, Jerome, as well as the rest, read: \"Great is themystery of godliness WHICH WAS manifested in the flesh.\" Newton adds, that nowthat the disputes over this forgery are over, they that read GOD made manifestin the flesh, instead of the godliness which was manifested in the flesh, thinkthis passage \"one of the most obvious and pertinent texts for the business.\" And now we ask again the question: Who were the first Christians? Those who werereadily converted by the eloquent simplicity of Paul, who promised them, withthe name of Jesus, freedom from the narrow bonds of ecclesiasticism. Theyunderstood but one thing; they were the \"children of promise\" (Galatians iv.28). The \"allegory\" of the Mosaic Bible was unveiled to them; the covenant \"fromthe Mount Sinai which gendereth to bondage\" was Agar (Ibid., 24), the old Jewishsynagogue, and she was \"in bondage with her children\" to Jerusalem, the new andthe free, \"the mother of us all.\" On the one hand the synagogue and the lawwhich persecuted every one who dared to step across the narrow path of bigotryand dogmatism; on the other, Paganism *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_302] with its grandphilosophical truths concealed from sight; unveiling itself but to the few, andleaving the masses hopelessly seeking to discover who was the god, among thisovercrowded pantheon of deities and sub-deities. To others, the apostle ofcircumcision, supported by all his followers, was promising, if they obeyed the\"law,\" a life hereafter, and a resurrection of which they had no previous idea.At the same time he never lost an occasion to contradict Paul without naminghim, but indicating him so clearly that it is next to impossible to doubt whomPeter meant. While he may have converted some men, who whether they had believedin the Mosaic resurrection promised by the Pharisees, or had fallen into thenihilistic doctrines of the Sadducees, or had belonged to the polytheisticheathenism of the Pagan rabble, had no future after death, nothing but amournful blank, we do not think that the work of contradiction, carried on sosystematically by the two apostles, had helped much their work of proselytism.With the educated thinking classes they succeeded very little, as ecclesiasticalhistory clearly shows. Where was the truth; where the inspired word of God? Onthe one hand as we have seen, they heard the apostle Paul explaining that of thetwo covenants, \"which things are an allegory,\" the old one from Mount Sinai,\"which gendereth unto bondage,\" was Agar the bondwoman; and Mount Sinai itselfanswered to \"Jerusalem,\" which now is \"in bondage\" with her circumcisedchildren; and the new covenant meant Jesus Christ--the \"Jerusalem which is aboveand free\"; and on the other Peter, who was contradicting and even abusing him.Paul vehemently exclaims, \"Cast out the bondwoman and her son\" (the old law andthe synagogue). \"The son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of thefree woman.\" \"Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath madeus free; be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. . . . Behold, I Paulsay unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing!\" (Gal.v. 2). What do we find Peter writing? Whom does he mean by saying, \"These whospeak great swelling words of vanity. . . . While they promise them liberty,they themselves are servants of corruption, for of whom a man is overcome, ofthe same is he brought in bondage. . . . For if they have escaped the pollutionof the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour, they are againentangled therein, and overcome . . . it had been better for them not to haveknown the way of righteousness, than after they have known it to turn from theholy commandment delivered unto them\" (Second Epistle). Peter certainly cannot have meant the Gnostics, for they had never seen \"theholy commandment delivered unto them\"; Paul had. They never promised any one\"liberty\" from bondage, but Paul had done so repeatedly. Moreover the latterrejects the \"old covenant,\" Agar the bondwoman; and Peter holds fast to it. Paulwarns the people against the powers and dignities (the lower angels of thekabalists); and Peter, as will be shown further, respects them and denouncesthose who do not. Peter preaches circumcision, and Paul forbids it. Later, when all these extraordinary blunders, contradictions, dissensions andinventions were forcibly crammed into a frame elaborately executed by theepiscopal caste of the new religion, and called Christianity; and the chaoticpicture itself cunningly preserved from too close scrutiny by a whole array offormidable Church penances and anathemas, which kept the curious back under thefalse pretense of sacrilege and profanation of divine mysteries; and millions ofpeople had been butchered in the name of the God of mercy--then came theReformation. It certainly deserves its name in its fullest paradoxical sense. Itabandoned Peter and alleges to have chosen Paul for its only leader. And theapostle who thundered against the old law of bondage; who left full liberty toChristians to either observe the Sabbath or set it aside; who rejects everythinganterior to John the Baptist, is now the professed standard-bearer ofProtestantism, which holds to the old law more than the Jews, imprisons thosewho view the Sabbath as Jesus and Paul did, and outvies the synagogue of thefirst century in dogmatic intolerance! But who then were the first Christians, may still be asked? Doubtless theEbionites; and in this we follow the authority of the best critics. \"There canbe little doubt that the author (of the Clementine Homilies) was arepresentative of Ebionitic Gnosticism, which had once been the purest form ofprimitive Christianity. . . .\" * And who were the Ebionites? The pupils andfollowers of the early Nazarenes, the kabalistic Gnostics. In the preface to theCodex Nazaraeus, the translator says: \"That also the Nazarenes did not reject .. . the Æons is natural. For of the Ebionites who acknowledged them (the Æons),these were the instructors.\" ** We find, moreover, Epiphanius, the Christian Homer of The Heresies, telling usthat \"Ebion had the opinion of the Nazarenes, the form of the Cerinthians (whofable that the world was put together by angels), and the appellation ofChristians.\" *** An appellation certainly more correctly applied to them than tothe orthodox (so-called) Christians of the school of Irenaeus and the laterVatican. Renan shows the Ebionites numbering among their sect all the survivingrelatives of Jesus. John the Baptist, his cousin and precursor, was the acceptedSaviour of the Nazarenes, and their prophet. His disciples dwelt on the otherside of the Jordan, and the scene of the baptism of the Jordan is clearly andbeyond any question proved by the author of Sod, the Son of the Man, to havebeen the site of the Adonis-worship. **** \"Over the Jordan and beyond the lakedwelt the Nazarenes, a sect said to have existed already at the birth of Jesus,and to have counted him among its number. They must have extended along the eastof the Jordan, and southeasterly among the Arabians (Galat. i. 17, 21; ii. 11),and Sabaeans in the direction of Bosra; and again, they must have gone far northover the Lebanon to Antioch, also to the northeast to the Nazarian settlement inBeroea, where St. Jerome found them. In the desert the Mysteries of Adonis mayhave still prevailed; in the mountains Aiai Adonai was still a cry.\" ***** \"Having been united (conjunctus) to the Nazarenes, each (Ebionite) imparted tothe other out of his own wickedness, and decided that Christ was of the seed ofa man,\" writes Epiphanius. And if they did, we must suppose they knew more about their contemporary prophetthan Epiphanius 400 years later. Theodoret, as shown elsewhere, describes theNazarenes as Jews who \"honor the Anointed as a just man,\" and use the evangelcalled \"According to Peter.\" Jerome finds the authentic and original evangel,written in Hebrew, by Matthew the apostle-publican, in the library collected atCaesarea, by the martyr Pamphilius. \"I received permission from the Nazaraeans,who at Beroea of Syria used this (gospel) to translate it,\" he writes toward theend of the fourth century. * \"In the evangel which the Nazarenes and Ebionitesuse,\" adds Jerome, \"which recently I translated from Hebrew into Greek, **andwhich is called by most persons the genuine Gospel of Matthew,\" etc. That the apostles had received a \"secret doctrine\" from Jesus, and that hehimself taught one, is evident from the following words of Jerome, who confessedit in an unguarded moment. Writing to the Bishops Chromatius and Heliodorus, hecomplains that \"a difficult work is enjoined, since this translation has beencommanded me by your Felicities, which St. Matthew himself, the Apostle andEvangelist, DID NOT WISH TO BE OPENLY WRITTEN. For if it had not been SECRET, he(Matthew) would have added to the evangel that which he gave forth was his; buthe made up this book sealed up in the Hebrew characters, which he put forth evenin such a way that the book, written in Hebrew letters and by the hand ofhimself, might be possessed by the men most religious, who also, in the courseof time, received it from those who preceded them. But this very book they nevergave to any one to be transcribed, and its text they related some one way andsome another.\" *** And he adds further on the same page: \"And it happened thatthis book, having been published by a disciple of Manichaeus, named Seleucus,who also wrote falsely The Acts of the Apostles, exhibited matter not foredification, but for destruction; and that this book was approved in a synodwhich the ears of the Church properly refused to listen to.\" **** He admits, himself, that the book which he authenticates as being written \"bythe hand of Matthew\"; a book which, notwithstanding that he translated it twice,was nearly unintelligible to him, for it was arcane or a secret. Nevertheless,Jerome coolly sets down every commentary upon it, except his own, as heretical.More than that, Jerome knew that this original Gospel of Matthew was theexpounder of the only true doctrine of Christ; and that it was the work of anevangelist who had been the friend and companion of Jesus. He knew that if ofthe two Gospels, the Hebrew in question and the Greek belonging to our presentScripture, one was spurious, hence heretical, it was not that of the Nazarenes;and yet, knowing all this, Jerome becomes more zealous than ever in hispersecutions of the \"Haeretics.\" Why? Because to accept it was equivalent toreading the death-sentence of the established Church. The Gospel according tothe Hebrews was but too well known to have been the only one accepted for fourcenturies by the Jewish Christians, the Nazarenes and the Ebionites. And neitherof the latter accepted the divinity of Christ. If the commentaries of Jerome on the Prophets, his famous Vulgate, and numerouspolemical treatises are all as trustworthy as this version of the Gospelaccording to Matthew, then we have a divine revelation indeed. Why wonder at the unfathomable mysteries of the Christian religion, since it isperfectly human? Have we not a letter written by one of the most respectedFathers of the Church to this same Jerome, which shows better than whole volumestheir traditionary policy? This is what Saint Gregory of Nazianzen wrote to hisfriend and confidant Saint Jerome: \"Nothing can impose better on a people thanverbiage; the less they understand the more they admire. Our fathers and doctorshave often said, not what they thought, but what circumstances and necessityforced them to.\" But to return to our Sophia-Achamoth and the belief of the genuine, primitiveChristians. After having produced Ilda-Baoth, Ilda from [images/00036.jpg], a child, andBaoth from [images/00037.jpg], the egg, or [images/00038.jpg], Baoth, a waste, adesolation, Sophia-Achamoth suffered so much from the contact with matter, thatafter extraordinary struggles she escapes at last out of the muddy chaos.Although unacquainted with the pleroma, the region of her mother, she reachedthe middle space and succeeded in shaking off the material parts which havestuck to her spiritual nature; after which she immediately built a strongbarrier between the world of intelligences (spirits) and the world of matter.Ilda-Baoth, is thus the \"son of darkness,\" the creator of our sinful world (thephysical portion of it). He follows the example of Bythos and produces fromhimself six stellar spirits (sons). They are all in his own image, andreflections one of the other, which become darker as they successively recedefrom their father. With the latter, they all inhabit seven regions disposed likea ladder, beginning under the middle space, the region of their mother,Sophia-Achamoth, and ending with our earth, the seventh region. Thus they arethe genii of the seven planetary spheres of which the lowest is the region ofour earth (the sphere which surrounds it, our aether). The respective names ofthese genii of the spheres are Iove (Jehovah), Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloi, Ouraios,Astaphaios. * The first four, as every one knows, are the mystic names of theJewish \"Lord God,\" **he being, as C. W. King expresses it, \"thus degraded by theOphites into the appellations of the subordinates of the Creator; the two lastnames are those of the genii of fire and water.\" Ilda-Baoth, whom several sects regarded as the God of Moses, was not a purespirit; he was ambitious and proud, and rejecting the spiritual light of themiddle space offered him by his mother Sophia-Achamoth, he set himself to createa world of his own. Aided by his sons, the six planetary genii, he fabricatedman, but this one proved a failure. It was a monster; soulless, ignorant, andcrawling on all fours on the ground like a material beast. Ilda-Baoth was forcedto implore the help of his spiritual mother. She communicated to him a ray ofher divine light, and so animated man and endowed him with a soul. And now beganthe animosity of Ilda-Baoth toward his own creature. Following the impulse ofthe divine light, man soared higher and higher in his aspirations; very soon hebegan presenting not the image of his Creator Ilda-Baoth but rather that of theSupreme Being, the \"primitive man,\" Ennoia. Then the Derniurgus was filled withrage and envy; and fixing his jealous eye on the abyss of matter, his looksenvenomed with passion were suddenly reflected in it as in a mirror; thereflection became animate, and there arose out of the abyss Satan, serpent,Ophiomorphos--\"the embodiment of envy and of cunning. He is the union of allthat is most base in matter, with the hate, envy, and craft of a spiritualintelligence.\" *** After that, always in spite at the perfection of man, Ilda-Baoth created thethree kingdoms of nature, the mineral, vegetable, and animal, with all evilinstincts and properties. Impotent to annihilate the Tree of Knowledge, whichgrows in his sphere as in every one of the planetary regions, but bent upondetaching \"man\" from his spiritual protectress, Ilda-Baoth forbade him to eat ofits fruit, for fear it should reveal to mankind the mysteries of the superiorworld. But Sophia-Achamoth, who loved and protected the man whom she hadanimated, sent her own genius Ophis, in the form of a serpent to induce man totransgress the selfish and unjust command. And \"man\" suddenly became capable ofcomprehending the mysteries of creation. Ilda-Baoth revenged himself by punishing the first pair, for man, through hisknowledge, had already provided for himself a companion out of his spiritual andmaterial half. He imprisoned man and woman in a dungeon of matter, in the bodyso unworthy of his nature, wherein man is still enthralled. But Achamothprotected him still. She established between her celestial region and \"man,\" acurrent of divine light, and kept constantly supplying him with this spiritualillumination. Then follow allegories embodying the idea of dualism, or the struggle betweengood and evil, spirit and matter, which is found in every cosmoogony, and thesource of which is again to be sought in India. The types and antitypesrepresent the heroes of this Gnostic Pantheon, borrowed from the most ancientmythopoeic ages. But, in these personages, Ophis and Ophiomorphos, Sophia andSophia-Achamoth, Adam-Kadmon, and Adam, the planetary genii and the divine Æons,we can also recognize very easily the models of our biblical copies--theeuhemerized patriarchs. The archangels, angels, virtues and powers, are allfound, under other names, in the Vedas and the Buddhistic system. The AvesticSupreme Being, Zero-ana, or \"Boundless Time,\" is the type of all these Gnosticand kabalistic \"Depths,\" \"Crowns,\" and even of the Chaldean En-Soph. The sixAmshaspands, created through the \"Word\" of Ormazd, the \"First-Born,\" have theirreflections in Bythos and his emanations, and the antitype of Ormazd--Ahrimanand his devs also enter into the composition of Ilda-Baoth and his six material,though not wholly evil, planetary genii. Achamoth, afflicted with the evils which befall humanity, notwithstanding herprotection, beseeches the celestial mother Sophia--her antitype-- to prevail onthe unknown DEPTH to send down Christos (the son and emanation of the \"CelestialVirgin\") to the help of perishing humanity. Ilda-Baoth and his six sons ofmatter are shutting out the divine light from mankind. Man must be saved.Ilda-Baoth had already sent his own agent, John the Baptist, from the race ofSeth, whom he protects--as a prophet to his people; but only a small portionlistened to him--the Nazarenes, the opponents of the Jews, on account of theirworshipping Iurbo-Adunai. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_315] Achamoth had assured herson, Ilda-Baoth, that the reign of Christos would be only temporal, and thusinduced him to send the forerunner, or precursor. Besides that, she made himcause the birth of the man Jesus from the Virgin Mary, her own type on earth,\"for the creation of a material personage could only be the work of theDemiurgus, not falling within the province of a higher power. As soon as Jesuswas born, Christos, the perfect, uniting himself with Sophia (wisdom andspirituality), descended through the seven planetary regions, assuming in eachan analogous form, and concealing his true nature from their genii, while heattracted into himself the sparks of divine light which they retained in theiressence. Thus, Christos entered into the man Jesus at the moment of his baptismin the Jordan. From that time Jesus began to work miracles; before that, he hadbeen completely ignorant of his mission.\" * Ilda-Baoth, discovering that Christos was bringing to an end his own kingdom ofmatter, stirred up the Jews against him, and Jesus was put to death. ** When onthe Cross, Christos and Sophia left his body and returned to their own sphere.The material body of the man Jesus was abandoned to the earth, but he himselfwas given a body made up of aether (astral soul). \"Thenceforward he consisted ofmerely soul and spirit, which was the reason why the disciples did not recognizehim after the resurrection. In this spiritual state of a simulacrum, Jesusremained on earth for eighteen months after he had risen. During this lastsojourn, he received from Sophia that perfect knowledge, that true Gnosis, whichhe communicated to the very few among the apostles who were capable of receivingthe same.\" \"Thence, ascending up into the middle space, he sits on the right hand ofIlda-Baoth, but unperceived by him, and there collects all the souls which shallhave been purified by the knowledge of Christ. When he has collected all thespiritual light that exists in matter, out of Ilda-Baoth's empire, theredemption will be accomplished and the world will be destroyed. Such is themeaning of the re-absorption of all the spiritual light into the pleroma orfulness, whence it originally descended.\" The foregoing is from the description given by Theodoret and adopted by King inhis Gnostics, with additions from Epiphanius and Irenaeus. But the former givesa very imperfect version, concocted partly from the descriptions of Irenaeus,and partly from his own knowledge of the later Ophites, who, toward the end ofthe third century, had blended already with several other sects. Irenaeus alsoconfounds them very frequently, and the real theogony of the Ophites is given bynone of them correctly. With the exception of a change in names, the above-giventheogony is that of all the Gnostics, and also of the Nazarenes. Ophis is butthe successor of the Egyptian Chnuphis, the Good Serpent with a lion's radiatinghead, and was held from days of the highest antiquity as an emblem of wisdom, orThauth, the instructor and Saviour of humanity, the \"Son of God.\" \"Oh men, livesoberly . . . win your immortality\" exclaims Hermes, the thrice-greatTrismegistus. \"Instructor and guide of humanity, I will lead you on tosalvation.\" Thus the oldest sectarians regarded Ophis, the Agathodaemon, asidentical with Christos; the serpent being the emblem of celestial wisdom andeternity, and, in the present case, the antitype of the EgyptianChnuphis-serpent. These Gnostics, the earliest of our Christian era, held: \"Thatthe supreme Æon, having emitted other Æons out of himself, one of them, afemale, Prunnikos (concupiscence), descended into the chaos, whence, unable toescape, she remained suspended in the mid-space, being too clogged by matter toreturn above, and not falling lower where there was nothing in affinity with hernature. She then produced her son Ilda-Baoth, the God of the Jews, who, in histurn, produced seven Æons, or angels, * who created the seven heavens.\" In this plurality of heavens the Christians believed from the first, for we findPaul teaching of their existence, and speaking of a man \"caught up to the thirdheaven\" (2 Corin., xiii.). \"From these seven angels Ilda-Baoth shut up all thatwas above him, lest they should know of anything superior to himself. ** Theythen created man in the image of their Father, *** but prone and crawling on theearth like a worm. But the heavenly mother, Prunnikos, wishing to depriveIlda-Baoth of the power with which she had unwittingly endowed him, infused intoman a celestial spark--the spirit. Immediately man rose upon his feet, soared inmind beyond the limits of the seven spheres, and glorified the Supreme Father,Him that is above Ilda-Baoth. Hence, the latter, full of jealousy, cast down hiseyes upon the lowest stratum of matter, and begot a potency in the form of aserpent, whom they (the Ophites) call his son. Eve, obeying him as the son ofGod, was persuaded to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_321] It is a self-evident factthat the serpent of the Genesis, who appears suddenly and without anypreliminary introduction, must have been the antitype of the Persian Arch-Devs,whose head is Ash-Mogh, the \"two-footed serpent of lies.\" If the Bible-serpenthad been deprived of his limbs before he had tempted woman unto sin, why shouldGod specify as a punishment that he should go \"upon his belly\"? Nobody supposesthat he walked upon the extremity of his tail. This controversy about the supremacy of Jehovah, between the Presbyters andFathers on the one hand, and the Gnostics, the Nazarenes, and all the sectsdeclared heterodox, as a last resort, on the other, lasted till the days ofConstantine, and later. That the peculiar ideas of the Gnostics about thegenealogy of Jehovah, or the proper place that had to be assigned, in theChristian-Gnostic Pantheon, to the God of the Jews, were at first deemed neitherblasphemous nor heterodox is evident in the difference of opinions held on thisquestion by Clemens of Alexandria, for instance, and Tertullian. The former, whoseems to have known of Basilides better than anybody else, saw nothing heterodoxor blamable in the mystical and transcendental views of the new Reformer. \"Inhis eyes,\" remarks the author of The Gnostics, speaking of Clemens, \"Basilideswas not a heretic, i.e., an innovator as regards the doctrines of the ChristianChurch, but a mere theosophic philosopher, who sought to express ancient truthsunder new forms, and perhaps to combine them with the new faith, the truth ofwhich he could admit without necessarily renouncing the old, exactly as is thecase with the learned Hindus of our day.\" ** Not so with Irenaeus and Tertullian. ***The principal works of the latteragainst the Heretics, were written after his separation from the CatholicChurch, when he had ranged himself among the zealous followers of Montanus; andteem with unfairness and bigoted prejudice. **** He has exaggerated every Gnostic opinion to a monstrous absurdity, and hisarguments are not based on coercive reasoning but simply on the blindstubbornness of a partisan fanatic. Discussing Basilides, the \"pious, god-like,theosophic philosopher,\" as Clemens of Alexandria thought him, Tertullianexclaims: \"After this, Basilides, the heretic, broke loose. * He asserted thatthere is a Supreme God, by name Abraxas, by whom Mind was created, whom theGreeks call Nous. From her emanated the Word; from the Word, Providence; fromProvidence, Virtue and Wisdom; from these two again, Virtues, Principalities, **and Powers were made; thence infinite productions and emissions of angels. Amongthe lowest angels, indeed, and those that made this world, he sets last of allthe god of the Jews, whom he denies to be God himself, affirming that he is butone of the angels.\" *** It would be equally useless to refer to the direct apostles of Christ, and showthem as holding in their controversies that Jesus never made any differencebetween his \"Father\" and the \"Lord-God\" of Moses. For the Clementine Homilies,in which occur the greatest argumentations upon the subject, as shown in thedisputations alleged to have taken place between Peter and Simon the Magician,are now also proved to have been falsely attributed to Clement the Roman. Thiswork, if written by an Ebionite--as the author of Supernatural Religion declaresin common with some other commentators ****--must have been written either farlater than the Pauline period, generally assigned to it, or the dispute aboutthe identity of Jehovah with God, the \"Father of Jesus,\" have been distorted bylater interpolations. This disputation is in its very essence antagonistic tothe early doctrines of the Ebionites. The latter, as demonstrated by Epiphaniusand Theodoret, were the direct followers of the Nazarene sect * (the Sabians),the \"Disciples of John.\" He says, unequivocally, that the Ebionites believed inthe Æons (emanations), that the Nazarenes were their instructors, and that \"eachimparted to the other out of his own wickedness.\" Therefore, holding the samebeliefs as the Nazarenes did, an Ebionite would not have given even so muchchance to the doctrine supported by Peter in the Homilies. The old Nazarenes, aswell as the later ones, whose views are embodied in the Codex Nazaraseus, nevercalled Jehovah otherwise than Adonai, Iurbo, the God of the Abortive ** (theorthodox Jews). They kept their beliefs and religious tenets so secret that evenEpiphanius, writing as early as the end of the fourth century, *** confesses hisignorance as to their real doctrine. \"Dropping the name of Jesus,\" says theBishop of Salamis, \"they neither call themselves Iessaens, nor continue to holdthe name of the Jews, nor name themselves Christians, but Nazarenes . . . Theresurrection of the dead is confessed by them . . . but concerning Christ, Icannot say whether they think him a mere man, or as the truth is, confess thathe was born through the Holy Pneuma from the Virgin.\" **** While Simon Magus argues in the Homilies from the standpoint of every Gnostic(Nazarenes and Ebionites included), Peter, as a true apostle of circumcision,holds to the old Law and, as a matter of course, seeks to blend his belief inthe divinity of Christ with his old Faith in the \"Lord God\" and ex-protector ofthe \"chosen people.\" As the author of Supernatural Religion shows, theEpitome, ***** \"a blending of the other two, probably intended to purge themfrom heretical doctrine\" ******and, together with a great majority of critics,assigns to the Homilies, a date not earlier than the end of the third century,we may well infer that they must differ widely with their original, if thereever was one. Simon the Magician proves throughout the whole work that theDemiurgus, the Architect of the World, is not the highest Deity; and he baseshis assertions upon the words of Jesus himself, who states repeatedly that \"noman knew the Father.\" Peter is made in the Homilies to repudiate, with a greatshow of indignation, the assertion that the Patriarchs were not deemed worthy toknow the Father; to which Simon objects again by quoting the words of Jesus, whothanks the \"Lord of Heaven and earth that what was concealed from the wise\" hehas \"revealed to babes,\" proving very logically that according to these verywords the Patriarchs could not have known the \"Father.\" Then Peter argues, inhis turn, that the expression, \"what is concealed from the wise,\" etc., referredto the concealed mysteries of the creation. * This argumentation of Peter, therefore, had it even emanated from the apostlehimself, instead of being a \"religious romance,\" as the author of SupernaturalReligion calls it, would prove nothing whatever in favor of the identity of theGod of the Jews, with the \"Father\" of Jesus. At best it would only demonstratethat Peter had remained from first to last \"an apostle of circumcision,\" a Jewfaithful to his old law, and a defender of the Old Testament. This conversationproves, moreover, the weakness of the cause he defends, for we see in theapostle a man who, although in most intimate relations with Jesus, can furnishus nothing in the way of direct proof that he ever thought of teaching that theall-wise and all-good Paternity he preached was the morose and revengefulthunderer of Mount Sinai. But what the Homilies do prove, is again our assertionthat there was a secret doctrine preached by Jesus to the few who were deemedworthy to become its recipients and custodians. \"And Peter said: 'We rememberthat our Lord and teacher, as commanding, said to us, guard the mysteries forme, and the sons of my house. Wherefore also he explained to his disciples,privately, the mysteries of the kingdoms of the heavens.' \" ** If we now recall the fact that a portion of the Mysteries of the \"Pagans\"consisted of the aporrheta, or secret discourses; that the secret Logia ordiscourses of Jesus contained in the original Gospel according to Matthew, themeaning and interpretation of which St. Jerome confessed to be \"a difficulttask\" for him to achieve, were of the same nature; and if we remember, further,that to some of the interior or final Mysteries only a very select few wereadmitted; and that finally it was from the number of the latter that were takenall the ministers of the holy \"Pagan\" rites, we will then clearly understandthis expression of Jesus quoted by Peter: \"Guard the Mysteries for me and thesons of my house,\" i.e., of my doctrine. And, if we understand it rightly, wecannot avoid thinking that this \"secret\" doctrine of Jesus, even the technicalexpressions of which are but so many duplications of the Gnostic andNeo-platonic mystic phraseology--that this doctrine, we say, was based on thesame transcendental philosophy of Oriental Gnosis as the rest of the religionsof those and earliest days. That none of the later Christian sects, despitetheir boasting, were the inheritors of it, is evident from the contradictions,blunders, and clumsy repatching of the mistakes of every preceding century bythe discoveries of the succeeding one. These mistakes, in a number ofmanuscripts claimed to be authentic, are sometimes so ridiculous as to bear ontheir face the evidence of being pious forgeries. Thus, for instance, the utterignorance of some patristic champions of the very gospels they claimed todefend. We have mentioned the accusation against Marcion by Tertullian andEpiphanius of mutilating the Gospel ascribed to Luke, and erasing from it thatwhich is now proved to have never been in that Gospel at all. Finally, themethod adopted by Jesus of speaking in parables, in which he only followed theexample of his sect, is attributed in the Homilies to a prophecy of Isaiah!Peter is made to remark: \"For Isaiah said: 'I will open my mouth in parables,and I will utter things that have been kept secret from the foundation of theworld.' \" This erroneous reference to Isaiah of a sentence given in Psalmslxxviii. 2, is found not only in the apocryphal Homilies, but also in theSinaitic Codex. Commenting on the fact in the Supernatural Religion, the authorstates that \"Porphyry, in the third century, twitted Christians with thiserroneous ascription by their inspired evangelist to Isaiah of a passage from aPsalm, and reduced the Fathers to great straits.\" *Eusebius and Jerome tried toget out of the difficulty by ascribing the mistake to an \"ignorant scribe\"; andJerome even went to the length of asserting that the name of Isaiah never stoodafter the above sentence in any of the old codices, but that the name of Asaphwas found in its place, only \"ignorant men had removed it.\" **To this, theauthor again observes that \"the fact is that the reading 'Asaph' for 'Isaiah' isnot found in any manuscript extant; and, although 'Isaiah' has disappeared fromall but a few obscure codices, it cannot be denied that the name anciently stoodin the text. In the Sinaitic Codex, which is probably the earliest manuscriptextant . . . and which is assigned to the fourth century,\" he adds, \"the prophetIsaiah stands in the text by the first hand, but is erased by the second.\" *** It is a most suggestive fact that there is not a word in the so-called sacredScriptures to show that Jesus was actually regarded as a God by his disciples.Neither before nor after his death did they pay him divine honors. Theirrelation to him was only that of disciples and \"master\"; by which name theyaddressed him, as the followers of Pythagoras and Plato addressed theirrespective masters before them. Whatever words may have been put into the mouthsof Jesus, Peter, John, Paul, and others, there is not a single act of adorationrecorded on their part, nor did Jesus himself ever declare his identity with hisFather. He accused the Pharisees of stoning their prophets, not of deicide. Hetermed himself the son of God, but took care to assert repeatedly that they wereall the children of God, who was the Heavenly Father of all. In preaching this,he but repeated a doctrine taught ages earlier by Hermes, Plato, and otherphilosophers. Strange contradiction! Jesus, whom we are asked to worship as theone living God, is found, immediately after his Resurrection, saying to MaryMagdalene: \"I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and sayunto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God!\"(John xx. 17.) Does this look like identifying himself with his Father? \"My Father and yourFather, my God and your God,\" implies, on his part, a desire to be considered ona perfect equality with his brethren--nothing more. Theodoret writes: \"Thehaeretics agree with us respecting the beginning of all things. . . . But theysay there is not one Christ (God), but one above, and the other below. And thislast formerly dwelt in many; but the Jesus, they at one time say is from God, atanother they call him a SPIRIT.\" * This spirit is the Christos, the messenger oflife, who is sometimes called the Angel Gabriel (in Hebrew, the mighty one ofGod), and who took with the Gnostics the place of the Logos, while the HolySpirit was considered Life. ** With the sect of the Nazarenes, though, theSpiritus, or Holy Ghost, had less honor. While nearly every Gnostic sectconsidered it a Female Power, whether they called it Binah, [images/00039.jpg],Sophia, the Divine Intellect, with the Nazarene sect it was the Female Spiritus,the astral light, the genetrix of all things of matter, the chaos in its evilaspect, made turbido by the Demiurge. At the creation of man, \"it was light onthe side of the FATHER, and it was light (material light) on the side of theMOTHER. And this is the 'two-fold man,' \" *** says the Sohar. \"That day (thelast one) will perish the seven badly-disposed stellars, also the sons of man,who have confessed the Spiritus, the Messias (false), the Deus, and the MOTHERof the SPIRITUS shall perish.\" **** Jesus enforced and illustrated his doctrines with signs and wonders; and if welay aside the claims advanced on his behalf by his deifiers, he did but whatother kabalists did; and only they at that epoch, when, for two centuries thesources of prophecy had been completely dried up, and from this stagnation ofpublic \"miracles\" had originated the skepticism of the unbelieving sect of theSadducees. Describing the \"heresies\" of those days, Theodoret, who has no ideaof the hidden meaning of the word Christos, the anointed messenger, complainsthat they (the Gnostics) assert that this Messenger or Delegatus changes hisbody from time to time, \"and goes into other bodies, and at each time isdifferently Manifested. And these (the overshadowed prophets) use incantationsand invocations of various demons and baptisms in the confession of theirprinciples. . . . They embrace astrology and magic, and the mathematical error,\"(?) he says. * This \"mathematical error,\" of which the pious writer complains, led subsequentlyto the rediscovery of the heliocentric system, erroneous as it may still be, andforgotten since the days of another \"magician\" who taught it--Pythagoras. Thus,the wonders of healing and the thaums of Jesus, which he imparted to hisfollowers, show that they were learning, in their daily communication with him,the theory and practice of the new ethics, day by day, and in the familiarintercourse of intimate friendship. Their faith was progressively developed,like that of all neophytes, simultaneously with the increase of knowledge. Wemust bear in mind that Josephus, who certainly must have been well-informed onthe subject, calls the skill of expelling demons \"a science.\" This growth offaith is conspicuously shown in the case of Peter, who, from having lackedenough faith to support him while he could walk on the water from the boat tohis Master, at last became so expert a thaumaturgist, that Simon Magus is saidto have offered him money to teach him the secret of healing, and other wonders.And Philip is shown to have become an Æthrobat as good as Abaris of Pythagoreanmemory, but less expert than Simon Magus. Neither in the Homilies nor any other early work of the apostles, is thereanything to show that either of his friends and followers regarded Jesus asanything more than a prophet. The idea is as clearly established in theClementines. Except that too much room is afforded to Peter to establish theidentity of the Mosaic God with the Father of Jesus, the whole work is devotedto Monotheism. The author seems as bitter against Polytheism as against theclaim to the divinity of Christ. ** He seems to be utterly ignorant of theLogos, and his speculation is confined to Sophia, the Gnostic wisdom. There isno trace in it of a hypostatic trinity, but the same overshadowing of theGnostic \"wisdom (Christos and Sophia) is attributed in the case of Jesus as itis in those of Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. * Thesepersonages are all placed on one level, and called 'true prophets,' and theseven pillars of the world.\" More than that, Peter vehemently denies the fall ofAdam, and with him, the doctrine of atonement, as taught by Christian theology,utterly falls to the ground, for he combats it as a blasphemy. ** Peter's theoryof sin is that of the Jewish kabalists, and even, in a certain way, Platonic.Adam not only never sinned, but, \"as a true prophet, possessed of the Spirit ofGod, which afterwards was in Jesus, could not sin.\" *** In short, the whole ofthe work exhibits the belief of the author in the kabalistic doctrine ofpermutation. The Kabala teaches the doctrine of transmigration of thespirit. **** \"Mosah is the revolutio of Seth and Hebel.\" ***** \"Tell me who it is who brings about the re-birth (the revolutio)?\" is asked ofthe wise Hermes. \"God's Son, the only man, through the will of God,\" is theanswer of the \"heathen.\" ****** \"God's son\" is the immortal spirit assigned to every human being. It is thisdivine entity which is the \"only man,\" for the casket which contains our soul,and the soul itself, are but half-entities, and without its overshadowing bothbody and astral soul, the two are but an animal duad. It requires a trinity toform the complete \"man,\" and allow him to remain immortal at every \"re-birth,\"or revolutio, throughout the subsequent and ascending spheres, every one ofwhich brings him nearer to the refulgent realm of eternal and absolute light. \"God's FIRST-BORN, who is the 'holy Veil,' the 'Light of Lights,' it is he whosends the revolutio of the Delegatus, for he is the First Power,\" says thekabalist. ******* \"The pneuma (spirit) and the dunamis (power), which is from the God, it is rightto consider nothing else than the Logos, who is also (?) First-begotten to theGod,\" argues a Christian. ******** \"Angels and powers are in heaven!\" says Justin, thus bringing forth a purelykabalistic doctrine. The Christians adopted it from the Sohar and the hereticalsects, and if Jesus mentioned them, it was not in the official synagogues thathe learned the theory, but directly in the kabalistic teachings. In the Mosaicbooks, very little mention is made of them, and Moses, who holds directcommunications with the \"Lord God,\" troubles himself very little about them. Thedoctrine was a secret one, and deemed by the orthodox synagogue heretical.Josephus calls the Essenes heretics, saying: \"Those admitted among the Essenesmust swear to communicate their doctrines to no one any otherwise than as hereceived them himself, and equally to preserve the books belonging to theirsect, and the names of the angels. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_354] The Sadducees did notbelieve in angels, neither did the uninitiated Gentiles, who limited theirOlympus to gods and demi-gods, or \"spirits.\" Alone, the kabalists and theurgistshold to that doctrine from time immemorial, and, as a consequence, Plato, andPhilo Judaeus after him, followed first by the Gnostics, and then by theChristians. Thus, if Josephus never wrote the famous interpolation forged by Eusebius,concerning Jesus, on the other hand, he has described in the Essenes all theprincipal features that we find prominent in the Nazarene. When praying, theysought solitude. ** \"When thou prayest, enter into thy closet . . . and pray tothy Father which is in secret\" (Matthew vi. 6). \"Everything spoken by them(Essenes) is stronger than an oath. Swearing is shunned by them\" (Josephus II.,viii., 6). \"But I say unto you, swear not at all . . . but let yourcommunication be yea, yea; nay, nay\" (Matthew v. 34-37). The Nazarenes, as well as the Essenes and the Therapeutae, believed more intheir own interpretations of the \"hidden sense\" of the more ancient Scriptures,than in the later laws of Moses. Jesus, as we have shown before, felt but littleveneration for the commandments of his predecessor, with whom Irenaeus is soanxious to connect him. The Essenes \"enter into the houses of those whom they never saw previously, asif they were their intimate friends\" (Josephus II., viii., 4). Such wasundeniably the custom of Jesus and his disciples. Epiphanius, who places the Ebionite \"heresy\" on one level with that of theNazarenes, also remarks that the Nazaraioi come next to the Cerinthians, *** somuch vituperated against by Irenaeus. **** Munk, in his work on Palestine, affirms that there were 4,000 Essenes living inthe desert; that they had their mystical books, and predicted the future. * TheNabatheans, with very little difference indeed, adhered to the same belief asthe Nazarenes and the Sabeans, and all of them honored John the Baptist morethan his successor Jesus. The Persian Iezidi say that they originally came toSyria from Busrah. They use baptism, and believe in seven archangels, thoughpaying at the same time reverence to Satan. Their prophet Iezed, who flourishedlong prior to Mahomet, ** taught that God will send a messenger, and that thelatter would reveal to him a book which is already written in heaven from theeternity. *** The Nabatheans inhabited the Lebanon, as their descendants do tothe present day, and their religion was from its origin purely kabalistic.Maimonides speaks of them as if he identified them with the Sabeans. \"I willmention to thee the writings . . . respecting the belief and institutions of theSabeans,\" he says. \"The most famous is the book The Agriculture of theNabathaeans, which has been translated by Ibn Waho-hijah. This book is full ofheathenish foolishness. . . . It speaks of the preparations of TALISMANS, thedrawing down of the powers of the SPIRITS, MAGIC, DEMONS, and ghouls, which maketheir abode in the desert.\" **** There are traditions among the tribes livingscattered about beyond the Jordan, as there are many such also among thedescendants of the Samaritans at Damascus, Gaza, and at Naplosa (the ancientShechem). Many of these tribes have, notwithstanding the persecutions ofeighteen centuries, retained the faith of their fathers in its primitivesimplicity. It is there that we have to go for traditions based on historicaltruths, however disfigured by exaggeration and inaccuracy, and compare them withthe religious legends of the Fathers, which they call revelation. Eusebiusstates that before the siege of Jerusalem the small Christiancommunity--comprising members of whom many, if not all, knew Jesus and hisapostles personally--took refuge in the little town of Pella, on the oppositeshore of the Jordan. Surely these simple people, separated for centuries fromthe rest of the world, ought to have preserved their traditions fresher than anyother nations! It is in Palestine that we have to search for the clearest watersof Christianity, let alone its source. The first Christians, after the death ofJesus, all joined together for a time, whether they were Ebionites, Nazarenes,Gnostics, or others. They had no Christian dogmas in those days, and theirChristianity consisted in believing Jesus to be a prophet, this belief varyingfrom seeing in him simply a \"just man,\" * or a holy, inspired prophet, a vehicleused by Christos and Sophia to manifest themselves through. These all unitedtogether in opposition to the synagogue and the tyrannical technicalities of thePharisees, until the primitive group separated in two distinct branches--which,we may correctly term the Christian kabalists of the Jewish Tanaim school, andthe Christian kabalists of the Platonic Gnosis. ** The former were representedby the party composed of the followers of Peter, and John, the author of theApocalypse; the latter ranged with the Pauline Christianity, blending itself, atthe end of the second century, with the Platonic philosophy, and engulfing,still later, the Gnostic sects, whose symbols and misunderstood mysticismoverflowed the Church of Rome. Amid this jumble of contradictions, what Christian is secure in confessinghimself such? In the old Syriac Gospel according to Luke (iii. 22), the HolySpirit is said to have descended in the likeness of a dove. \"Jesua, full of thesacred Spirit, returned from Jordan, and the Spirit led him into the desert\"(old Syriac, Luke iv. 1, Tremellius). \"The difficulty,\" says Dunlap, \"was thatthe Gospels declared that John the Baptist saw the Spirit (the Power of God)descend upon Jesus after he had reached manhood, and if the Spirit then firstdescended upon him, there was some ground for the opinion of the Ebionites andNazarenes who denied his preceding existence, and refused him the attributes ofthe LOGOS. The Gnostics, on the other hand, objected to the flesh, but concededthe Logos.\" *** John's Apocalypsis, and the explanations of sincere Christian bishops, likeSynesius, who, to the last, adhered to the Platonic doctrines, make us thinkthat the wisest and safest way is to hold to that sincere primitive faith whichseems to have actuated the above-named bishop. This best, sincerest, and mostunfortunate of Christians, addressing the \"Unknown,\" exclaims: \"Oh Father of theWorlds . . . Father of the Æons . . . Artificer of the Gods, it is holy topraise!\" But Synesius had Hypatia for instructor, and this is why we find himconfessing in all sincerity his opinions and profession of faith. \"The rabbledesires nothing better than to be deceived. . . . As regards myself, therefore,I will always be a philosopher with myself, but I must be priest with thepeople.\" \"Holy is God the Father of all being, holy is God, whose wisdom is carried outinto execution by his own Powers! . . . Holy art Thou, who through the Word hadcreated all! Therefore, I believe in Thee, and bear testimony, and go into theLIFE and LIGHT.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_365] Thusspeaks Hermes Trismegistus, the heathen divine. What Christian bishop could havesaid better than that? The apparent discrepancy of the four gospels as a whole, does not prevent everynarrative given in the New Testament--however much disfigured--having aground-work of truth. To this, are cunningly adapted details made to fit thelater exigencies of the Church. So, propped up partially by indirect evidence,still more by blind faith, they have become, with time, articles of faith. Eventhe fictitious massacre of the \"Innocents\" by King Herod has a certainfoundation to it, in its allegorical sense. Apart from the now-discovered factthat the whole story of such a massacre of the Innocents is bodily taken fromthe Hindu Bagaved-gitta, and Brahmanical traditions, the legend refers,moreover, allegorically, to an historical fact. King Herod is the type of Kansa,the tyrant of Madura, the maternal uncle of Christna, to whom astrologerspredicted that a son of his niece Devaki would deprive him of his throne.Therefore he gives orders to kill the male child that is born to her; butChristna escapes his fury through the protection of Mahadeva (the great God) whocauses the child to be carried away to another city, out of Kansa's reach. Afterthat, in order to be sure and kill the right boy, on whom he failed to lay hismurderous hands, Kansa has all the male newborn infants within his kingdomkilled. Christna is also worshipped by the gopas (the shepherds) of the land. Though this ancient Indian legend bears a very suspicious resemblance to themore modern biblical romance, Gaffarel and others attribute the origin of thelatter to the persecutions during the Herodian reign of the kabalists and theWise men, who had not remained strictly orthodox. The latter, as well as theprophets, were nicknamed the \"Innocents,\" and the \"Babes,\" on account of theirholiness. As in the case of certain degrees of modern Masonry, the adeptsreckoned their grade of initiation by a symbolic age. Thus Saul who, when chosenking, was \"a choice and goodly man,\" and \"from his shoulders upward was higherthan any of the people,\" is described in Catholic versions, as \"child of oneyear when he began to reign,\" which, in its literal sense, is a palpableabsurdity. But in 1 Samuel x., his anointing by Samuel and initiation aredescribed; and at verse 6th, Samuel uses this significant language: \" . . . theSpirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them, andshalt be turned into another man.\" The phrase above quoted is thus madeplain--he had received one degree of initiation and was symbolically describedas \"a child one year old.\" The Catholic Bible, from which the text is quoted,with charming candor says in a foot-note: \"It is extremely difficult to explain\"(meaning that Saul was a child of one year). But undaunted by any difficulty theEditor, nevertheless, does take upon himself to explain it, and adds: \"A childof one year. That is, he was good and like an innocent child.\" An interpretationas ingenious as it is pious; and which if it does no good can certainly do noharm. * If the explanation of the kabalists is rejected, then the whole subject fallsinto confusion; worse still--for it becomes a direct plagiarism from the Hindulegend. All the commentators have agreed that a literal massacre of youngchildren is nowhere mentioned in history; and that, moreover, an occurrence likethat would have made such a bloody page in Roman annals that the record of itwould have been preserved for us by every author of the day. Herod himself wassubject to the Roman law; and undoubtedly he would have paid the penalty of sucha monstrous crime, with his own life. But if, on the one hand, we have not theslightest trace of this fable in history, on the other, we find in the officialcomplaints of the Synagogue abundant evidence of the persecution of theinitiates. The Talmud also corroborates it. The Jewish version of the birth of Jesus is recorded in the Sepher-Toldos Jeshuin the following words: \"Mary having become the mother of a Son, named Jehosuah, and the boy growing up,she entrusted him to the care of the Rabbi Elhanan, and the child progressed inknowledge, for he was well gifted with spirit and understanding. \"Rabbi Jehosuah, son of Perachiah, continued the education of Jehosuah (Jesus)after Elhanan, and initiated him in the secret knowledge\"; but the King,Janneus, having given orders to slay all the initiates, Jehosuah Ben Perachiah,fled to Alexandria, in Egypt, taking the boy with him. While in Alexandria, continues the story, they were received in the house of arich and learned lady (personified Egypt). Young Jesus found her beautiful,notwithstanding \"a defect in her eyes,\" and declared so to his master. Uponhearing this, the latter became so angry that his pupil should find in the landof bondage anything good, that \"he cursed him and drove the young man from hispresence.\" Then follow a series of adventures told in allegorical language,which show that Jesus supplemented his initiation in the Jewish Kabala with anadditional acquisition of the secret wisdom of Egypt. When the persecutionceased, they both returned to Judea. * The real grievances against Jesus are stated by the learned author of Tela IgneaSatanae (the fiery darts of Satan) to be two in number: 1st, that he haddiscovered the great Mysteries of their Temple, by having been initiated inEgypt; and 2d, that he had profaned them by exposing them to the vulgar, whomisunderstood and disfigured them. This is what they say: ** \"There exists, in the sanctuary of the living God, a cubical stone, on which aresculptured the holy characters, the combination of which gives the explanationof the attributes and powers of the incommunicable name. This explanation is thesecret key of all the occult sciences and forces in nature. It is what theHebrews call the Scham hamphorash. This stone is watched by two lions of gold,who roar as soon as it is approached. *** The gates of the temple were neverlost sight of, and the door of the sanctuary opened but once a year, to admitthe High Priest alone. But Jesus, who had learned in Egypt the 'great secrets'at the initiation, forged for himself invisible keys, and thus was enabled topenetrate into the sanctuary unseen. . . . He copied the characters on thecubical stone, and hid them in his thigh; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_370] after which, emerging fromthe temple, he went abroad and began astounding people with his miracles. Thedead were raised at his command, the leprous and the obsessed were healed. Heforced the stones which lay buried for ages at the bottom of the sea to rise tothe surface until they formed a mountain, from the top of which he preached.\"The Sepher Toldos states further that, unable to displace the cubical stone ofthe sanctuary, Jesus fabricated one of clay, which he showed to the nations andpassed it off for the true cubical stone of Israel. This allegory, like the rest of them in such books, is written \"inside andoutside\"--it has its secret meaning, and ought to be read two ways. Thekabalistic books explain its mystical meaning. Further, the same Talmudist says,in substance, the following: Jesus was thrown in prison, ** and kept there fortydays; then flogged as a seditious rebel; then stoned as a blasphemer in a placecalled Lud, and finally allowed to expire upon a cross. \"All this,\" explainsLevi, \"because he revealed to the people the truths which they (the Pharisees)wished to bury for their own use. He had divined the occult theology of Israel,had compared it with the wisdom of Egypt, and found thereby the reason for auniversal religious synthesis.\" *** However cautious one ought to be in accepting anything about Jesus from Jewishsources, it must be confessed that in some things they seem to be more correctin their statements (whenever their direct interest in stating facts is notconcerned) than our good but too jealous Fathers. One thing is certain, James,the \"Brother of the Lord,\" is silent about the resurrection. He terms Jesusnowhere \"Son of God,\" nor even Christ-God. Once only, speaking of Jesus, hecalls him the \"Lord of Glory,\" but so do the Nazarenes when writing about theirprophet Iohanan bar Zacharia, or John, son of Zacharias (St. John Baptist).Their favorite expressions about their prophet are the same as those used byJames when speaking of Jesus. A man \"of the seed of a man,\" \"Messenger of Life,\"of light, \"my Lord Apostle,\" \"King sprung of Light,\" and so on. \"Have not thefaith of our Lord JESUS Christ, the Lord of Glory,\" etc., says James in hisepistle (ii. 1), presumably addressing Christ as GOD. \"Peace to thee, my Lord,JOHN Abo Sabo, Lord of Glory!\" says the Codex Nazaraeus (ii., 19), known toaddress but a prophet. \"Ye have condemned and killed the Just,\" says James (v.6). \"Iohanan (John) is the Just one, he comes in the way of justice,\" saysMatthew (xxi. 32, Syriac text). James does not even call Jesus Messiah, in the sense given to the title by theChristians, but alludes to the kabalistic \"King Messiah,\" who is Lord ofSabaoth * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_373] (v. 4), andrepeats several times that the \"Lord\" will come, but identifies the latternowhere with Jesus. \"Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of theLord . . . be patient, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh\" (v. 7, 8). Andhe adds: \"Take, my brethren, the prophet (Jesus) who has spoken in the name ofthe Lord for an example of suffering, affliction, and of patience.\" Though inthe present version the word \"prophet\" stands in the plural, yet this is adeliberate falsification of the original, the purpose of which is too evident.James, immediately after having cited the \"prophets\" as an example, adds:\"Behold . . . ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of theLord\"--thus combining the examples of these two admirable characters, andplacing them on a perfect equality. But we have more to adduce in support of ourargument. Did not Jesus himself glorify the prophet of the Jordan? \"What went yeout for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. . . .Verily, I say unto you, among them that are born of women there hath not risen agreater than John the Baptist.\" And of whom was he who spoke thus born? It is but the Roman Catholics who havechanged Mary, the mother of Jesus, into a goddess. In the eyes of all otherChristians she was a woman, whether his own birth was immaculate or otherwise.According to strict logic, then, Jesus confessed John greater than himself. Notehow completely this matter is disposed of by the language employed by the AngelGabriel when addressing Mary: \"Blessed art thou among women.\" These words areunequivocal. He does not adore her as the Mother of God, nor does he call hergoddess; he does not even address her as \"Virgin,\" but he calls her woman, andonly distinguishes her above other women as having had better fortune, throughher purity. The Nazarenes were known as Baptists, Sabians, and John's Christians. Theirbelief was that the Messiah was not the Son of God, but simply a prophet whowould follow John. \"Johanan, the Son of the Abo Sabo Zachariah, shall say tohimself, 'Whoever will believe in my justice and my BAPTISM shall be joined tomy association; he shall share with me the seat which is the abode of life, ofthe supreme Mano, and of living fire' \" (Codex Nazaraeus, ii., p. 115). Origenremarks \"there are some who said of John (the Baptist) that he was the anointed\"(Christus). * The Angel Rasiel of the kabalists is the Angel Gabriel of theNazarenes, and it is the latter who is chosen of all the celestial hierarchy bythe Christians to become the messenger of the 'annunciation.' \"The genius sentby the 'Lord of Celsitude' is Æbel Zivo, whose name is also called GABRIELLegatus.\" ** Paul must have had the sect of the Nazarenes in mind when he said:\"And last of all he (Jesus) was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time\"(1 Corinth., xv. 8), thus reminding his listeners of the expression usual to theNazarenes, who termed the Jews \"the abortions, or born out of time.\" Paul prideshimself of belonging to a haeresy. *** When the metaphysical conceptions of the Gnostics, who saw in Jesus the Logosand the anointed, began to gain ground, the earliest Christians separated fromthe Nazarenes, who accused Jesus of perverting the doctrines of John, andchanging the baptism of the Jordan. **** \"Directly,\" says Milman, \"as it (theGospel) got beyond the borders of Palestine, and the name of 'Christ' hadacquired sanctity and veneration in the Eastern cities, he became a kind ofmetaphysical impersonation, while the religion lost its purely moral cast andassumed the character of a speculative theogony.\" ***** The only half-originaldocument that has reached us from the primitive apostolic days, is the Logia ofMatthew. The real, genuine doctrine has remained in the hands of the Nazarenes,in this Gospel of Matthew containing the \"secret doctrine,\" the \"Sayings ofJesus,\" mentioned by Papias. These sayings were, no doubt, of the same nature asthe small manuscripts placed in the hands of the neophytes, who were candidatesfor the Initiations into the Mysteries, and which contained the Aporrheta, therevelations of some important rites and symbols. For why should Matthew takesuch precautions to make them \"secret\" were it otherwise? Primitive Christianity had its grip, pass-words, and degrees of initiation. Theinnumerable Gnostic gems and amulets are weighty proofs of it. It is a wholesymbolical science. The kabalists were the first to embellish the universalLogos, ****** with such terms as \"Light of Light,\" the Messenger of LIFE andLIGHT, * and we find these expressions adopted in toto by the Christians, withthe addition of nearly all the Gnostic terms such as Pleroma (fulness), Archons,Æons, etc. As to the \"First-Born,\" the First, and the \"Only-Begotten,\" these areas old as the world. Origen shows the word \"Logos\" as existing among theBrachmanes. \"The Brachmanes say that the God is Light, not such as one sees, norsuch as the sun and fire; but they have the God LOGOS, not the articulate, theLogos of the Gnosis, through whom the highest MYSTERIES of the Gnosis are seenby the wise.\" ** The Acts and the fourth Gospel teem with Gnostic expressions.The kabalistic: \"God's first-born emanated from the Most High,\" together withthat which is the \"Spirit of the Anointing\"; and again \"they called him theanointed of the Highest,\" *** are reproduced in Spirit and substance by theauthor of the Gospel according to John. \"That was the true light,\" and \"thelight shineth in darkness.\" \"And the WORD was made flesh.\" \"And his fulness(pleroma) have all we received,\" etc. (John i. et seq.). The \"Christ,\" then, and the \"Logos\" existed ages before Christianity; theOriental Gnosis was studied long before the days of Moses, and we have to seekfor the origin of all these in the archaic periods of the primeval Asiaticphilosophy. Peter's second Epistle and Jude's fragment, preserved in the NewTestament, show by their phraseology that they belong to the kabalistic OrientalGnosis, for they use the same expressions as did the Christian Gnostics whobuilt a part of their system from the Oriental Kabala. \"Presumptuous are they(the Ophites), self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of DIGNITIES,\"says Peter (2d Epistle ii. 10), the original model for the later abusiveTertullian and Irenaeus. **** \"Likewise (even as Sodom and Gomorrah) also thesefilthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise DOMINION and speak evil of DIGNITIES,\"says Jude, repeating the very words of Peter, and thereby expressionsconsecrated in the Kabala. Dominion is the \"Empire,\" the tenth of the kabalisticsephiroth. ***** The Powers and Dignities are the subordinate genii of theArchangels and Angels of the Sohar. * These emanations are the very life andsoul of the Kabala and Zoroastrianism; and the Talmud itself, in its presentstate, is all borrowed from the Zendavesta. Therefore, by adopting the views ofPeter, Jude, and other Jewish apostles, the Christians have become but adissenting sect of the Persians, for they do not even interpret the meaning ofall such Powers as the true kabalists do. Paul's warning his converts againstthe worshipping of angels, shows how well he appreciated, even so early as hisperiod, the dangers of borrowing from a metaphysical doctrine the philosophy ofwhich could be rightly interpreted but by its well-learned adherents, the Magiand the Jewish Tanaim. \"Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntaryhumility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hathnot seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,\" ** is a sentence laid right atthe door of Peter and his champions. In the Talmud, Michael is Prince of Water,who has seven inferior spirits subordinate to him. He is the patron, theguardian angel of the Jews, as Daniel informs us (v. 21), and the Greek Ophites,who identified him with their Ophiomorphos, the personified creation of the envyand malice of Ilda-Baoth, the Demiurgus (Creator of the material world), andundertook to prove that he was also Samuel, the Hebrew prince of the evilspirits, or Persian devs, were naturally regarded by the Jews as blasphemers.But did Jesus ever sanction this belief in angels except in so far as hintingthat they were the messengers and subordinates of God? And here the origin ofthe later splits between Christian beliefs is directly traceable to these twoearly contradictory views. Paul, believing in all such occult powers in the world \"unseen,\" but ever\"present,\" says: \"Ye walked according to the Æon of this world, according to theArchon (Ilda-Baoth, the Demiurge) that has the domination of the air,\" and \"Wewrestle not against flesh and blood, but against the dominations, the powers;the lords of darkness, the mischievousness of spirits in the upper regions.\"This sentence, \"Ye were dead in sin and error,\" for \"ye walked according to theArchon,\" or Ilda-Baoth, the God and creator of matter of the Ophites, showsunequivocally that: 1st, Paul, notwithstanding some dissensions with the moreimportant doctrines of the Gnostics, shared more or less their cosmogonicalviews on the emanations; and 2d, that he was fully aware that this Demiurge,whose Jewish name was Jehovah, was not the God preached by Jesus. And now, if wecompare the doctrine of Paul with the religious views of Peter and Jude, we findthat, not only did they worship Michael, the Archangel, but that also theyreverenced SATAN, because the latter was also, before his fall, an angel! Thisthey do quite openly, and abuse the Gnostics * for speaking \"evil\" of him. Noone can deny the following: Peter, when denouncing those who are not afraid tospeak evil of \"dignities,\" adds immediately, \"Whereas angels, which are greaterin power and might, bring not railing accusations against them (the dignities)before the Lord\" (ii. 11). Who are the dignities? Jude, in his general epistle,makes the word as clear as day. The dignities are the DEVILS!! Complaining ofthe disrespect shown by the Gnostics to the powers and dominions, Jude argues inthe very words of Peter: \"And yet, Michael, the Archangel, when contending withthe devil, he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him arailing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee\" (i. 9). Is this plainenough? If not, then we have the Kabala to prove who were the dignities. Considering that Deuteronomy tells us that the \"Lord\" Himself buried Moses in avalley of Moab (xxxiv. 6), \"and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day,\"this biblical lapsus inguae of Jude gives a strong coloring to the assertions ofsome of the Gnostics. They claimed but what was secretly taught by the Jewishkabalists themselves; to wit: that the highest supreme God was unknown andinvisible; \"the King of Light is a closed eye\"; that Ilda-Baoth, the Jewishsecond Adam, was the real Demiurge; and that Iao, Adonai, Sabaoth, and Eloi werethe quaternary emanation which formed the unity of the God of theHebrews--Jehovah. Moreover, the latter was also called Michael and Samael bythem, and regarded but as an angel, several removes from the Godhead. In holdingto such a belief, the Gnostics countenanced the teachings of the greatest of theJewish doctors, Hillel, and other Babylonian divines. Josephus shows the greatdeference of the official Synagogue in Jerusalem to the wisdom of the schools ofCentral Asia. The colleges of Sora, Pumbiditha, and Nahaidea were considered theheadquarters of esoteric and theological learning by all the schools ofPalestine. The Chaldean version of the Pentateuch, made by the well-knownBabylonian divine, Onkelos, was regarded as the most authoritative of all; andit is according to this learned Rabbi that Hillel and other Tanaim after himheld that the Being who appeared to Moses in the burning bush, on Mount Sinai,and who finally buried him, was the angel of the Lord, Memro, and not the LordHimself; and that he whom the Hebrews of the Old Testament mistook for Iahoh wasbut His messenger, one of His sons, or emanations. All this establishes but onelogical conclusion--namely, that the Gnostics were by far the superiors of thedisciples, in point of education and general information; even in a knowledge ofthe religious tenets of the Jews themselves. While they were perfectlywell-versed in the Chaldean wisdom, the well-meaning, pious, but fanatical aswell as ignorant disciples, unable to fully understand or grasp the religiousspirit of their own system, were driven in their disputations to such convincinglogic as the use of \"brute beasts,\" \"sows,\" \"dogs,\" and other epithets so freelybestowed by Peter. Since then, the epidemic has reached the apex of the sacerdotal hierarchy. Fromthe day when the founder of Christianity uttered the warning, that he who shallsay to his brother, \"Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire,\" all who havepassed as its leaders, beginning with the ragged fishermen of Galilee, andending with the jewelled pontiffs, have seemed to vie with each other in theinvention of opprobrious epithets for their opponents. So we find Luther passinga final sentence on the Catholics, and exclaiming that \"The Papists are allasses, put them in whatever form you like; whether they are boiled, roasted,baked, fried, skinned, hashed, they will be always the same asses.\" Calvincalled the victims he persecuted, and occasionally burned, \"malicious barkingdogs, full of bestiality and insolence, base corrupters of the sacred writings,\"etc. Dr. Warburton terms the Popish religion \"an impious farce,\" and MonseigneurDupanloup asserts that the Protestant Sabbath service is the \"Devil's mass,\" andall clergymen are \"thieves and ministers of the Devil.\" The same spirit of incomplete inquiry and ignorance has led the Christian Churchto bestow on its most holy apostles, titles assumed by their most desperateopponents, the \"Haeretics\" and Gnostics. So we find, for instance, Paul termedthe vase of election \"Vas Electionis,\" a title chosen by Manes, * the greatestheretic of his day in the eyes of the Church, Manes meaning, in the Babylonianlanguage, the chosen vessel or receptacle. ** So with the Virgin Mary. They were so little gifted with originality, that theycopied from the Egyptian and Hindu religions their several apostrophes to theirrespective Virgin-mothers. The juxtaposition of a few examples will make thisclear. HINDU. Litany of our Lady Nari: Virgin (Also Devanaki.) 1. Holy Nari--Mariama, Mother of perpetual fecundity. 2. Mother of an incarnated God--Vishnu (Devanaki). 3. Mother of Christna. 4. Eternal Virginity--Kanyabava. 5. Mother--Pure Essence, Akasa. 6. Virgin most chaste--Kanya. 7. Mother Taumatra, of the five virtues or elements. 8. Virgin Trigana (of the three elements, power or richness, love, and mercy.) 9. Mirror of Supreme Conscience--Ahancara. 10. Wise Mother--Saraswati. 11. Virgin of the white Lotos, Pedma or Kamala. 12. Womb of Gold--Hyrania. 13. Celestial Light--Lakshmi. 14. Ditto. 15. Queen of Heaven, and of the universe--Sakti. 16. Mother soul of all beings--Paramatma. 17. Devanaki is conceived without sin, and immaculate herself. (According to theBrahmanic fancy.) EGYPTIAN. Litany of our Lady Isis: Virgin. 1. Holy Isis, universal mother--Muth. 2. Mother of Gods--Athyr. 3. Mother of Horus. 4. Virgo generatrix--Neith. 5. Mother-soul of the universe--Anouke. 6. Virgin sacred earth--Isis. 7. Mother of all the virtues--Thmei, with the same qualities. 8. Illustrious Isis, most powerful, merciful, just. (Book of the Dead.) 9. Mirror of Justice and Truth--Thmei. 10. Mysterious mother of the world--Buto (secret wisdom). 11. Sacred Lotus. 12. Sistrum of Gold. 13. Astarte (Syrian), Astaroth (Jewish). 14. Argua of the Moon. 15. Queen of Heaven, and of the universe--Sati. 16. Model of all mothers--Athor. 17. Isis is a Virgin Mother. ROMAN CATHOLIC. Litany of our Lady of Loretto: Virgin. 1. Holy Mary, mother of divine grace. 2. Mother of God. 3. Mother of Christ. 4 . Virgin of Virgins. 5. Mother of Divine Grace. 6. Virgin most chaste. 7. Mother most pure.Mother undefiled.Mother inviolate.Mother most amiable.Mother most admirable. 8. Virgin most powerful.Virgin most merciful.Virgin most faithful. 9. Mirror of Justice. 10. Seat of Wisdom. 11. Mystical Rose. 12. House of Gold. 13. Morning Star. 14. Ark of the Covenant. 15. Queen of Heaven. 16. Mater Dolorosa. 17. Mary conceived without sin. (In accordance with later orders.) If the Virgin Mary has her nuns, who are consecrated to her and bound to live inchastity, so had Isis her nuns in Egypt, as Vesta had hers at Rome, and theHindu Nari, \"mother of the world\" hers. The virgins consecrated to hercultus--the Devadasi of the temples, who were the nuns of the days of old--livedin great chastity, and were objects of the most extraordinary veneration, as theholy women of the goddess. Would the missionaries and some travellersreproachfully point to the modern Devadasis, or Nautch-girls? For all response,we would beg them to consult the official reports of the last quarter century,cited in chapter II., as to certain discoveries made at the razing of convents,in Austria and Italy. Thousands of infants' skulls were exhumed from ponds,subterranean vaults, and gardens of convents. Nothing to match this was everfound in heathen lands. Christian theology, getting the doctrine of the archangels and angels directlyfrom the Oriental Kabala, of which the Mosaic Bible is but an allegoricalscreen, ought at least to remember the hierarchy invented by the former forthese personified emanations. The hosts of the Cherubim and Seraphim, with whichwe generally see the Catholic Madonnas surrounded in their pictures, belong,together with the Elohim and Beni Elohim of the Hebrews, to the third kabalisticworld, Jezirah. This world is but one remove higher than Asiah, the fourth andlowest world, in which dwell the grossest and most material beings--theklippoth, who delight in evil and mischief, and whose chief is Belial! Explaining, in his way, of course, the various \"heresies\" of the first twocenturies, Irenaeus says: \"Our Haeretics hold . . . that PROPATOR is known butto the only-begotten son, that is to the mind\" (the nous). It was theValentinians, the followers of the \"profoundest doctor of the Gnosis,\"Valentinus, who held that \"there was a perfect AION, who existed before Bythos,or Buthon (the Depth), called Propator. This is again kabalistic, for in theSohar of Simon Ben Iochai, we read the following: \"Senior occultatus est etabsconditus; Microprosopus manifestus est, et non manifestus\" (Rosenroth: TheSohar Liber Mysteries, iv., 1). In the religious metaphysics of the Hebrews, the Highest One is an abstraction;he is \"without form or being,\" \"with no likeness with anything else.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu103.htm#fn_390] And even Philo calls theCreator, the Logos who stands next God, \"the SECOND God.\" \"The second God who ishis WISDOM.\" ** God is NOTHING, he is nameless, and therefore calledAin-Soph--the word Ain meaning nothing. *** But if, according to the older Jews,Jehovah is the God, and He manifested Himself several times to Moses and theprophets, and the Christian Church anathematized the Gnostics who denied thefact--how comes it, then, that we read in the fourth gospel that \"No man hathseen God AT ANY TIME, but the only-begotten Son . . . he hath declared him\"? Thevery words of the Gnostics, in spirit and substance. This sentence of St.John--or rather whoever wrote the gospel now bearing his name--floors all thePetrine arguments against Simon Magus, without appeal. The words are repeatedand emphasized in chapter vi.: \"Not that any man hath seen the Father, save hewhich is of God, he (Jesus) hath seen the Father\" (46)--the very objectionbrought forward by Simon in the Homilies. These words prove that either theauthor of the fourth evangel had no idea of the existence of the Homilies, orthat he was not John, the friend and companion of Peter, whom he contradictspoint-blank with this emphatic assertion. Be it as it may, this sentence, likemany more that might be profitably cited, blends Christianity completely withthe Oriental Gnosis, and hence with the KABALA. While the doctrines, ethical code, and observances of the Christian religionwere all appropriated from Brahmanism and Buddhism, its ceremonials, vestments,and pageantry were taken bodily from Lamaism. The Romish monastery and nunneryare almost servile copies of similar religious houses in Thibet and Mongolia,and interested explorers of Buddhist lands, when obliged to mention theunwelcome fact, have had no other alternative left them but, with an anachronismunsurpassed in recklessness, to charge the offense of plagiarism upon thereligious system their own mother Church had despoiled. This makeshift hasserved its purpose and had its day. The time has at last come when this page ofhistory must be written. [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES168:*Tertullian: \"Adv.

At what late period was fully established the divinity ofChrist we can judge by the mere fact that even in the fourth century Eusebiusdid not denounce this book as spurious, but only classed it with such as theApocalypse of John; and Credner (\"Zur Gesch. des Kan.,\" p. 120) shows Nicephorusinserting it, together with the Revelation, in his \"Stichometry,\" among theAntilegomena. The Ebionites, the genuine primitive Christians, rejecting therest of the apostolic writings, made use only of this Gospel (\"Adv. Haer.\" i.,26), and the Ebionites, as Epiphanius declares, firmly believed, with theNazarenes, that Jesus was but a man \"of the seed of a man.\" 184:* See King's \"Gnostics,\" p. 31. 184:** This Iove, Iao, or Jehovah is quite distinct from the God of theMysteries, IAO, held sacred by all the nations of antiquity.

Ofall examples of Christian ingratitude this seems almost the most conspicuous.The poor Jews are first robbed of their sacred books, and then, in a spurious\"Gospel,\" are insulted by the representation of Satan claiming them as his \"oldpeople.\" If they were his people, and at the same time are \"God's chosenpeople,\" then the name of this God must be written Satan and not Jehovah. Thisis logic, but we doubt if it can be regarded as complimentary to the \"Lord Godof Israel.\" 187:* This is the Nazarene system; the Spiritus, after uniting herself withKarabtanos (matter, turbulent and senseless), brings forth seven badly-disposedstellars, in the Orcus; \"Seven Figures,\" which she bore \"witless\" (\"CodexNazaraeus,\" i., p. 118).

How bitter this feeling has become, we can judge by the following wordsof the Reverend Father Parker of Hyde Park, New York, who, lecturing in St.Teresa's Catholic Church, on the 10th of December, 1876, said: \"To whom does theProtestant Church owe its possession of the Bible, which they wish to place inthe hands of every ignorant person and child? To monkish hands, that laboriouslytranscribed it before the age of printing. Protestantism has produced dissensionin Church, rebellions and outbreaks in State, unsoundness in social life, andwill never be satisfied short of the downfall of the Bible! Protestants mustadmit that the Roman Church has done more to scatter Christianity and extirpateidolatry than all their sects. From one pulpit it is said that there is no hell,and from another that there is immediate and unmitigated damnation. One saysthat Jesus Christ was only a man; another that you must be plunged bodily intowater to be baptized, and refuses the rites to infants. Most of them have noprescribed form of worship, no sacred vestments, and their doctrines are asundefined as their service is informal. The founder of Protestantism, MartinLuther, was the worst man in Europe. The advent of the Reformation was thesignal for civil war, and from that time to this the world has been in arestless state, uneasy in regard to Governments, and every day becoming moreskeptical. The ultimate tendency of Protestantism is clearly nothing less thanthe destruction of all respect for the Bible, and the disruption of governmentand society.\" Very plain talk this. The Protestants might easily return thecompliment. 201:* Eliphas Levi ascribes this narrative to the Talmudist authors of \"Sota\"and \"Sanhedrin,\" p. 19, book of \"Jechiel.\" 201:** This fragment is translated from the original Hebrew by Eliphas Levi inhis \"La Science des Esprits.\" 201:*** Those who know anything of the rites of the Hebrews must recognize inthese lions the gigantic figures of the Cherubim, whose symbolical monstrositywas well calculated to frighten and put to flight the profane. 202:* Arnobius tells the same story of Jesus, and narrates how he was accused ofhaving robbed the sanctuary of the secret names of the Holy One, by means ofwhich knowledge he performed all the miracles. 202:** This is a translation of Eliphas Levi. 202:*** \"La Science des Esprits,\" p. 37. 203:* \"Israelite Indeed,\" vol. iii., p. 61. 204:* \"Origen,\" vol. ii., p. 150. 204:** \"Codex Nazaraeus,\" vol. i., p. 23. 204:*** \"In the way these call heresy I worship\" (Acts xxiv. 14). 204:**** \"Codex Nazaraeus,\" vol. ii., p. 109. 204:***** \"Milman,\" p. 200. 204:****** Dunlap says in \"Sod, the Son of the Man\": \"Mr. Hall, of India,informs us that he has seen Sanscrit philosophical treatises in which the Logoscontinually occurs,\" p. 39, foot-note. 205:* See John i. 205:** Origen: \"Philosophumena,\" xxiv. 205:*** Kleuker: \"Natur und Ursprung der Emanationslehre bei den Kabbalisten,\"pp. 10, 11; see \"Libri Mysterii.\" 205:**** \"These as natural brute beasts.\" \"The dog has turned to its own vomitagain; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire\" (22). 205:***** The types of the creation, or the attributes of the Supreme Being, arethrough the emanations of Adam Kadmon; these are: \"The Crown, Wisdom, Prudence,Magnificence, Severity, Beauty, Victory, Glory, Foundation, Empire.

In the oldest Oriental Kabala, the Deity is represented as three circles in one,shrouded in a certain smoke or chaotic exhalation. In the preface to the Sohar,which transforms the three primordial circles into THREE HEADS, over these isdescribed an exhalation or smoke, neither black nor white, but colorless, andcircumscribed within a circle. This is the unknown Essence. *The origin of theJewish image may, perhaps, be traced to Hermes' Pimander, the Egyptian Logos,who appears within a cloud of a humid nature, with a smoke escaping from it. **In the Sohar the highest God is, as we have shown in the preceding chapter, andas in the case of the Hindu and Buddhist philosophies, a pure abstraction, whoseobjective existence is denied by the latter. It is Hakama, the \"SUPREME WISDOM,that cannot be understood by reflection,\" and that lies within and without theCRANIUM of LONG FACE ***(Sephira), the uppermost of the three \"Heads.\" It is the\"boundless and the infinite En-Soph,\" the No-Thing. The \"three Heads,\" superposed above each other, are evidently taken from thethree mystic triangles of the Hindus, which also superpose each other. Thehighest \"head\" contains the Trinity in Chaos, out of which springs themanifested trinity. En-Soph, the unrevealed forever, who is boundless andunconditioned, cannot create, and therefore it seems to us a great error toattribute to him a \"creative thought,\" as is commonly done by the interpreters.In every cosmogony this supreme Essence is passive; if boundless, infinite, andunconditioned, it can have no thought nor idea. It acts not as the result ofvolition, but in obedience to its own nature, and according to the fatality ofthe law of which it is itself the embodiment. Thus, with the Hebrew kabalists,En-Soph is non-existent [images/00040.jpg], for it is incomprehensible to ourfinite intellects, and therefore cannot exist to our minds. Its first emanationwas Sephira, the crown [images/00041.jpg]. When the time for an active periodhad come, then was produced a natural expansion of this Divine essence fromwithin outwardly, obedient to eternal and immutable law; and from this eternaland infinite light (which to us is darkness) was emitted a spiritualsubstance. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu104.htm#fn_396] This was theFirst Sephiroth, containing in herself the other nine[images/00042.jpg]Sephiroth, or intelligences. In their totality and unity theyrepresent the archetypal man, Adam Kadmon, the προτογονος, who in hisindividuality or unity is yet dual, or bisexual, the Greek Didumos, for he isthe prototype of all humanity. Thus we obtain three trinities, each contained ina \"head.\" In the first head, or face (the three-faced Hindu Trimurti), we findSephira, the first androgyne, at the apex of the upper triangle, emittingHackama, or Wisdom, a masculine and active potency--also called Jah,[images/00043.jpg]-- and Binah, [images/00039.jpg], or Intelligence, a femaleand passive potency, also represented by the name Jehovah [images/00024.jpg].These three form the first trinity or \"face\" of the Sephiroth. This triademanated Hesed, [images/00044.jpg], or Mercy, a masculine active potency, alsocalled El, from which emanated Geburah } [images/00045.jpg], or Justice, alsocalled Eloha, a feminine passive potency; from the union of these two wasproduced Tiphereth [images/00046.jpg], Beauty, Clemency, the Spiritual Sun,known by the divine name Elohim; and the second triad, \"face,\" or \"head,\" wasformed. These emanating, in their turn, the masculine potency Netzah,[images/00047.jpg], Firmness, or Jehovah Sabaoth, who issued the femininepassive potency Hod, [images/00048.jpg], Splendor, or Elohim Sabaoth; the twoproduced Jesod, [images/00049.jpg], Foundation, who is the mighty living oneEl-Chai, thus yielding the third trinity or \"head.\" The tenth Sephiroth israther a duad, and is represented on the diagrams as the lowest circle. It isMalchuth or Kingdom, [images/00050.jpg], and Shekinah [images/00051.jpg], alsocalled Adonai, and Cherubim among the angelic hosts. The first \"Head\" is calledthe Intellectual world; the second \"Head\" is the Sensuous, or the world ofPerception, and the third is the Material or Physical world. \"Before he gave any shape to the universe,\" says the Kabala, \"before he producedany form, he was alone without any form and resemblance to anything else. Who,then, can comprehend him, how he was before the creation, since he was formless?Hence, it is forbidden to represent him by any form, similitude, or even by hissacred name, by a single letter, or a single point. . . . The Aged of the Aged,the Unknown of the Unknown, has a form, and yet no form. He has a form wherebythe universe is preserved, and yet has no form, because he cannot becomprehended. When he first assumed a form (in Sephira, his first emanation), hecaused nine splendid lights to emanate from it.\" * And now we will turn to the Hindu esoteric Cosmogony and definition of \"Him whois, and yet is not.\" \"From him who is, **from this immortal Principle which exists in our minds butcannot be perceived by the senses, is born Purusha, the Divine male and female,who became Narayana, or the Divine Spirit moving on the water.\" Swayambhuva, the unknown essence of the Brahmans, is identical with En-Soph, theunknown essence of the kabalists. As with the latter, the ineffable name couldnot be pronounced by the Hindus, under the penalty of death. In the ancientprimitive trinity of India, that which may be certainly considered as pre-Vedic,the germ which fecundates the mother-principle, the mundane egg, or theuniversal womb, is called Nara, the Spirit, or the Holy Ghost, which emanatesfrom the primordial essence. It is like Sephira, the oldest emanation, calledthe primordial point, and the White Head, for it is the point of divine lightappearing from within the fathomless and boundless darkness. In Manu it is\"NARA, or the Spirit of God, which moves on Ayana (Chaos, or place of motion),and is called NARAYANA, or moving on the waters.\" *** In Hermes, the Egyptian,we read: \"In the beginning of the time there was naught in the chaos.\" But whenthe \"verbum,\" issuing from the void like a \"colorless smoke,\" makes itsappearance, then \"this verbum moved on the humid principle.\" **** And in Genesiswe find: \"And darkness was upon the face of the deep (chaos). And the Spirit ofGod moved upon the face of the waters.\" In the Kabala, the emanation of theprimordial passive principle (Sephira), by dividing itself into two parts,active and passive, emits Chochma-Wisdom and Binah-Jehovah, and in conjunctionwith these two acolytes, which complete the trinity, becomes the Creator of theabstract Universe; the physical world being the production of later and stillmore material powers. ***** In the Hindu Cosmogony, Swayambhuva emits Nara andNari, its bisexual emanation, and dividing its parts into two halves, male andfemale, these fecundate the mundane egg, within which develops Brahma, or ratherViradj, the Creator. \"The starting-point of the Egyptian mythology,\" saysChampollion, \"is a triad . . . namely, Kneph, Neith, and Phtah; and Ammon, themale, the father; Muth, the female and mother; and Khons, the son.\" The ten Sephiroth are copies taken from the ten Pradjapatis created by Viradj,called the \"Lords of all beings,\" and answering to the biblical Patriarchs. Justin Martyr explains some of the \"heresies\" of the day, but in a veryunsatisfactory manner. He shows, however, the identity of all theworld-religions at their starting-points. The first beginning opens invariablywith the unknown and passive deity, producing from himself a certain activepower or virtue, \"Rational,\" which is sometimes called WISDOM, sometimes theSON, very often God, Angel, Lord, and LOGOS. * The latter is sometimes appliedto the very first emanation, but in several systems it proceeds from the firstandrogyne or double ray produced at the beginning by the unseen. Philo depictsthis wisdom as male and female. But though its first manifestation had abeginning, for it proceeded from Oulom ** (Aion, time), the highest of the Æons,when emitted from the Fathers, it had remained with him before all creations,for it is part of him. *** Therefore, Philo Judaeus calls Adam Kadmon \"mind\"(the Ennoia of Bythos in the Gnostic system). \"The mind, let it be namedAdam.\" **** Strictly speaking, it is difficult to view the Jewish Book of Genesis otherwisethan as a chip from the trunk of the mundane tree of universal Cosmogony,rendered in Oriental allegories. As cycle succeeded cycle, and one nation afteranother came upon the world's stage to play its brief part in the majestic dramaof human life, each new people evolved from ancestral traditions its ownreligion, giving it a local color, and stamping it with its individualcharacteristics. While each of these religions had its distinguishing traits, bywhich, were there no other archaic vestiges, the physical and psychologicalstatus of its creators could be estimated, all preserved a common likeness toone prototype. This parent cult was none other than the primitive\"wisdom-religion.\" The Israelitish Scriptures are no exception. Their nationalhistory--if they can claim any autonomy before the return from Babylon, and wereanything more than migratory septs of Hindu pariahs, cannot be carried back aday beyond Moses; and if this ex-Egyptian priest must, from theologicalnecessity, be transformed into a Hebrew patriarch, we must insist that theJewish nation was lifted with that smiling infant out of the bulrushes of LakeMoeris. Abraham, their alleged father, belongs to the universal mythology. Mostlikely he is but one of the numerous aliases of Zeruan (Saturn), the king of thegolden age, who is also called the old man (emblem of time). *****It is nowdemonstrated by Assyriologists that in the old Chaldean books Abraham is calledZeru-an, or Zerb-an--meaning one very rich in gold and silver, and a mightyprince. ******He is also called Zarouan and Zarman--a decrepit old man. ******* The ancient Babylonian legend is that Xisuthrus (Hasisadra of the Tablets, orXisuthrus) sailed with his ark to Armenia, and his son Sim became supreme king.Pliny says that Sim was called Zeruan; and Sim is Shem. In Hebrew, his namewrites img iu2-217}, Shem--a sign. Assyria is held by the ethnologists to be theland of Shem, and Egypt called that of Ham, Shem, in the tenth chapter ofGenesis is made the father of all the children of Eber, of Elam (Oulam orEilam), and Ashur (Assur or Assyria). The \"nephelim,\" or fallen men, Gebers,mighty men spoken of in Genesis (vi. 4), come from Oulam, \"men of Shem.\" EvenOphir, which is evidently to be sought for in the India of the days of Hiram, ismade a descendant of Shem. The records are purposely mixed up to make them fitinto the frame of the Mosaic Bible. But Genesis, from its first verse down tothe last, has naught to do with the \"chosen people\"; it belongs to the world'shistory. Its appropriation by the Jewish authors in the days of the so-calledrestoration of the destroyed books of the Israelites, by Ezra, proves nothing,and, until now, has been self-propped on an alleged divine revelation. It issimply a compilation of the universal legends of the universal humanity. Bunsensays that in the \"Chaldean tribe immediately connected with Abraham, we findreminiscences of dates disfigured and misunderstood, as genealogies of singlemen, or indications of epochs. The Abrahamic recollections go back at leastthree millennia beyond the grandfather of Jacob.\" * Alexander Polyhistor says that Abraham was born at Kamarina or Uria, a city ofsoothsayers, and invented astronomy. Josephus claims the same for Terah,Abraham's father. The tower of Babel was built as much by the direct descendantsof Shem as by those of the \"accursed\" Ham and Canaan, for the people in thosedays were \"one,\" and the \"whole earth was of one language\"; and Babel was simplyan astrological tower, and its builders were astrologers and adepts of theprimitive Wisdom-Religion, or, again, what we term Secret Doctrine. The Berosian Sibyl says: Before the Tower, Zeru-an, Titan, and Yapetosthegoverned the earth, Zeru-an wished to be supreme, but his two brothers resisted,when their sister, Astlik, intervened and appeased them. It was agreed thatZeru-an should rule, but his male children should be put to death; and strongTitans were appointed to carry this into effect. Sar (circle, saros) is the Babylonian god of the sky. He is also Assaros orAsshur (the son of Shem), and Zero--Zero-ana, the chakkra, or wheel, boundlesstime. Hence, as the first step taken by Zoroaster, while founding his newreligion, was to change the most sacred deities of the Sanscrit Veda into namesof evil spirits, in his Zend Scriptures, and even to reject a number of them, wefind no traces in the Avesta of Chakkra--the symbolic circle of the sky. Elam, another of the sons of Shem, is Oulam [images/00052.jpg]and refers to anorder or cycle of events. In Ecclesiastes iii. 11, it is termed \"world.\" InEzekiel xxvi. 20, \"of old time.\" In Genesis iii. 22, the word stands as\"forever\"; and in chapter ix. 16, \"eternal.\" Finally, the term is completelydefined in Genesis vi. 4, in the following words: \"There were nephelim (giants,fallen men, or Titans) on the earth.\" The word is synonymous with Æon, αιον. InProverbs viii. 23, it reads: \"I was effused from Oulam, from Ras\" (wisdom). Bythis sentence, the wise king-kabalist refers to one of the mysteries of thehuman spirit--the immortal crown of the man-trinity. While it ought to read asabove, and be interpreted kabalistically to mean that the I (or my eternal,immortal Ego), the spiritual entity, was effused from the boundless and namelesseternity, through the creative wisdom of the unknown God, it reads in thecanonical translation: \"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way,before his works of old\"! which is unintelligible nonsense, without thekabalistic interpretation. When Solomon is made to say that I was \"from thebeginning . . . while, as yet, he (the Supreme Deity) had not made the earth northe highest part of the dust of the world . . . I was there,\" and \"when heappointed the foundations of the earth . . . then I was by him, as one broughtup with him,\" what can the kabalist mean by the \"I,\" but his own divine spirit,a drop effused from that eternal fountain of light and wisdom--the universalspirit of the Deity? The thread of glory emitted by En-Soph from the highest of the three kabalisticheads, through which \"all things shine with light,\" the thread which makes itsexit through Adam Primus, is the individual spirit of every man. \"I was dailyhis (En-Soph's) delight, rejoicing always before him . . . and my delights werewith the sons of men,\" adds Solomon, in the same chapter of the Proverbs. Theimmortal spirit delights in the sons of men, who, without this spirit, are butdualities (physical body and astral soul, or that life-principle which animateseven the lowest of the animal kingdom). But, we have seen that the doctrineteaches that this spirit cannot unite itself with that man in whom matter andthe grossest propensities of his animal soul will be ever crowding it out.Therefore, Solomon, who is made to speak under the inspiration of his ownspirit, that possesses him for the time being, utters the following words ofwisdom: \"Hearken unto me, my son\" (the dual man), \"blessed are they who keep myways. . . . Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates. . .. For whoso findeth me, findeth life, and shall obtain favor of the Lord. . . .But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul . . . and loves death\"(Proverbs vii. 1-36). This chapter, as interpreted, is made by some theologians, like everything else,to apply to Christ, the \"Son of God,\" who states repeatedly, that he who followshim obtains eternal life, and conquers death. But even in its distortedtranslation it can be demonstrated that it referred to anything but to thealleged Saviour. Were we to accept it in this sense, then, the Christiantheology would have to return, nolens volens, to Averroism and Buddhism; to thedoctrine of emanation, in short; for Solomon says: \"I was effused\" from Oulamand Rasit, both of which are a part of the Deity; and thus Christ would not beas their doctrine claims, God himself, but only an emanation of Him, like theChristos of the Gnostics. Hence, the meaning of the personified Gnostic Æon, theword signifying cycles or determined periods in the eternity and at the sametime, representing a hierarchy of celestial beings--spirits. Thus Christ issometimes termed the \"Eternal Æon.\" But the word \"eternal\" is erroneous inrelation to the Æons. Eternal is that which has neither beginning nor end; butthe \"Emanations\" or Æons, although having lived as absorbed in the divineessence from the eternity, when once individually emanated, must be said to havea beginning. They may be therefore endless in this spiritual life, nevereternal. These endless emanations of the one First Cause, all of which were graduallytransformed by the popular fancy into distinct gods, spirits, angels, anddemons, were so little considered immortal, that all were assigned a limitedexistence. And this belief, common to all the peoples of antiquity, to theChaldean Magi as well as to the Egyptians and even in our day held by theBrahmanists and Buddhists, most triumphantly evidences the monotheism of theancient religious systems. This doctrine calls the life-period of all theinferior divinities, \"one day of Parabrahma.\" After a cycle of fourteenmilliards, three hundred and twenty-millions of human years--the traditionsays--the trinity itself, with all the lesser divinities, will be annihilated,together with the universe, and cease to exist. Then another universe willgradually emerge from the pralaya (dissolution), and men on earth will beenabled to comprehend SWAYAMBHUVA as he is. Alone, this primal cause will existforever, in all his glory, filling the infinite space. What better proof couldbe adduced of the deep reverential feeling with which the \"heathen\" regard theone Supreme eternal cause of all things visible and invisible. This is again the source from which the ancient kabalists derived identicaldoctrines. If the Christians understood Genesis in their own way, and, ifaccepting the texts literally, they enforced upon the uneducated masses thebelief in a creation of our world out of nothing; and moreover assigned to it abeginning, it is surely not the Tanaim, the sole expounders of the hiddenmeaning contained in the Bible, who are to be blamed. No more than any otherphilosophers had they ever believed either in spontaneous, limited, or ex nihilocreations. The Kabala has survived to show that their philosophy was preciselythat of the modern Nepal Buddhists, the Svabhavikas. They believed in theeternity and the indestructibility of matter, and hence in many prior creationsand destructions of worlds, before our own. \"There were old worlds whichperished.\" *\"From this we see that the Holy One, blessed be His name, hadsuccessively created and destroyed sundry worlds, before he created the presentworld; and when he created this world he said: 'This pleases me; the previousones did not please me.' \" **Moreover, they believed, again like theSvabhavikas, now termed Atheists, that every thing proceeds (is created) fromits own nature and that once that the first impulse is given by that CreativeForce inherent in the \"Self-created substance,\" or Sephira, everything evolvesout of itself, following its pattern, the more spiritual prototype whichprecedes it in the scale of infinite creation. \"The indivisible point which hasno limit, and cannot be comprehended (for it is absolute), expanded from within,and formed a brightness which served as a garment (a veil) to the indivisiblepoints. . . . It, too, expanded from within. . . . Thus, everything originatedthrough a constant upheaving agitation, and thus finally the worldoriginated.\" *** In the later Zoroastrian books, after that Darius had restored both the worshipof Ormazd and added to it the purer Magianism of the primitive Secret Wisdom--[images/00053.jpg], of which, as the inscription tells us, he was himself ahierophant, we see again reappearing the Zeru-ana, or boundless time,represented by the Brahmans in the chakkra, or a circle; that we see figuring onthe uplifted finger of the principal deities. Further on, we will show therelation in which it stands to the Pythagorean, mystical numbers--the first andthe last--which is a zero (0), and to the greatest of the Mystery-Gods IAO. Theidentity of this symbol alone, in all the old religions, is sufficient to showtheir common descent from one primitive Faith. **** This term of \"boundlesstime,\" which can be applied but to the ONE who has neither beginning nor end, iscalled by the Zoroastrians Zeruana-Akarene, because he has always existed. \"Hisglory,\" they say, is too exalted, his light too resplendent for either humanintellect or mortal eyes to grasp and see. His primal emanation is eternal lightwhich, from having been previously concealed in darkness, was called out tomanifest itself, and thus was formed Ormazd, \"the King of Life.\" He is thefirst-born of boundless time, but like his own antitype, or preexistingspiritual idea, has lived within primitive darkness from all eternity. His Logoscreated the pure intellectual world. After the lapse of three grand cycles * hecreated the material world in six periods. The six Amshaspands, or primitivespiritual men, whom Ormazd created in his own image, are the mediators betweenthis world and himself. Mithras is an emanation of the Logos and the chief ofthe twenty-eight izeds, who are the tutelary angels over the spiritual portionof mankind--the souls of men. The Ferouers are infinite in number. They are theideas or rather the ideal conceptions of things which formed themselves in themind of Ormazd or Ahuramazda before he willed them to assume a concrete form.They are what Aristotle terms \"privations\" of forms and substances. The religionof Zarathustra, as he is always called in the Avesta, is one from which theancient Jews have the most borrowed. In one of the Yashts, Ahuramazda, theSupreme, gives to the seer as one of his sacred names, Ahmi, \"I am\"; and inanother place, ahmi yat ahmi, \"I am that I am,\" as Jehovah is alleged to havegiven it to Moses. This Cosmogony, adopted with a change of names in the Rabbinical Kabala, foundits way, later, with some additional speculations of Manes, the half-Magus,half-Platonist, into the great body of Gnosticism. The real doctrines of theBasilideans, Valentinians, and the Marcionites cannot be correctly ascertainedin the prejudiced and calumnious writings of the Fathers of the Church; butrather in what remains of the works of the Bardesanesians, known as theNazarenes. It is next to impossible, now that all their manuscripts and booksare destroyed, to assign to any of these sects its due part in dissenting views.But there are a few men still living who have preserved books and directtraditions about the Ophites, although they care little to impart them to theworld. Among the unknown sects of Mount Lebanon and Palestine the truth has beenconcealed for more than a thousand years. And their diagram of the Ophite schemediffers with the description of it given by Origen and hence with the diagram ofMatter. ** The kabalistic trinity is one of the models of the Christian one. \"The ANCIENTwhose name be sanctified, is with three heads, but which make only one.\" *Triacapita exsculpa sunt, unum intra alterum, et alterum supra alterum. \"Three headsare inserted in one another, and one over the other. The first head is theConcealed Wisdom (Sapientia Abscondita). Under this head is the ANCIENT(Pythagorean Monad), the most hidden of mysteries; a head which is no head(caput quod non est caput); no one can know what that is in this head. Nointellect is able to comprehend this wisdom. ** This Senior Sanctissimus issurrounded by the three heads. He is the eternal LIGHT of the wisdom; and thewisdom is the source from which all the manifestations have begun. These threeheads, included in ONE HEAD (which is no head); and these three are bent down(overshadow) SHORT-FACE (the son) and through them all things shine withlight.\" ***\"En-Soph emits a thread from El or Al (the highest God of theTrinity), and the light follows the thread and enters, and passing through makesits exit through Adam Primus (Kadmon), who is concealed until the plan forarranging (statum dispositionis) is ready; it threads through him from his headto his feet; and in him (in the concealed Adam) is the figure of A MAN.\" **** \"Whoso wishes to have an insight into the sacred unity, let him consider a flamerising from a burning coal or a burning lamp. He will see first a two-foldlight--a bright white, and a black or blue light; the white light is above, andascends in a direct light, while the blue, or dark light, is below, and seems asthe chair of the former, yet both are so intimately connected together that theyconstitute only one flame. The seat, however, formed by the blue or dark light,is again connected with the burning matter which is under it again. The whitelight never changes its color, it always remains white; but various shades areobserved in the lower light, whilst the lowest light, moreover, takes twodirections; above, it is connected with the white light, and below with theburning matter. Now, this is constantly consuming itself, and perpetuallyascends to the upper light, and thus everything merges into a singleunity.\" ***** Such were the ancient ideas of the trinity in the unity, as an abstraction. Man,who is the microcosmos of the macrocosmos, or of the archetypal heavenly man,Adam Kadmon, is likewise a trinity; for he is body, soul, and spirit. \"All that is created by the 'Ancient of the Ancients' can live and exist only bya male and a female,\" says the Sohar. *He alone, to whom no one can say, \"Thou,\"for he is the spirit of the WHITE-HEAD in whom the \"THREE HEADS\" are united, isuncreated. Out of the subtile fire, on one side of the White Head, and of the\"subtile air,\" on the other, emanates Shekinah, his veil (the femininized HolyGhost). \"This air,\" says Idra Rabba, \"is the most occult (occultissimus)attribute of the Ancient of the Days. ** The Ancienter of the Ancienter is theConcealed of the Concealed. *** All things are Himself, and Himself is concealedon every way. **** The cranium of the WHITE-HEAD has no beginning, but its endhas a shining reflection and a roundness which is our universe.\" \"They regard,\" says Klenker, \"the first-born as man and wife, in so far as hislight includes in itself all other lights, and in so far as his spirit of lifeor breath of life includes all other life spirits in itself.\" ***** Thekabalistic Shekinah answers to the Ophite Sophia. Properly speaking, Adam Kadmonis the Bythos, but in this emanation-system, where everything is calculated toperplex and place an obstacle to inquiry, he is the Source of Light, the first\"primitive man,\" and at the same time Ennoia, the Thought of Bythos, the Depth,for he is Pimander. The Gnostics, as well as the Nazarenes, allegorizing on the personification,said that the First and Second man loved the beauty of Sophia, (Sephira) thefirst woman, and thus the Father and the Son fecundated the heavenly \"Woman\"and, from primal darkness procreated the visible light (Sephira is theInvisible, or Spiritual Light), \"whom they called the ANOINTED CHRISTUM, or KingMessiah.\" ****** This Christus is the Adam of Dust before his fall, with thespirit of the Adonai, his Father, and Shekinah Adonai, his mother, upon him; forAdam Primus is Adon, Adonai, or Adonis. The primal existence manifests itself byits wisdom, and produces the Intelligible LOGOS (all visible creation). Thiswisdom was venerated by the Ophites under the form of a serpent. So far we seethat the first and second life are the two Adams, or the first and the secondman. In the former lies Eva, or the yet unborn spiritual Eve, and she is withinAdam Primus, for she is a part of himself, who is androgyne. The Eva of dust,she who will be called in Genesis \"the mother of all that live,\" is within Adamthe Second. And now, from the moment of its first manifestation, the LORD MANO,the Unintelligible Wisdom, disappears from the scene of action. It will manifestitself only as Shekinah, the GRACE; for the CORONA is \"the innermost Light ofall Lights,\" and hence it is darkness's own substance. * In the Kabala, Shekinah is the ninth emanation of Sephira, which contains thewhole of the ten Sephiroth within herself. She belongs to the third triad and isproduced together with Malchuth or \"Kingdom,\" of which she is the femalecounterpart. Otherwise she is held to be higher than any of these; for she isthe \"Divine Glory,\" the \"veil,\" or \"garment,\" of En-Soph. The Jews, whenever sheis mentioned in the Targum, say that she is the glory of Jehovah, which dwelt inthe tabernacle, manifesting herself like a visible cloud; the \"Glory\" restedover the Mercy-Seat in the Sanctum Sanctorum. In the Nazarene or Bardesanian System, which may be termed the Kabala within theKabala, the Ancient of Days--Antiquus Altus, who is the Father of the Demiurgusof the universe, is called the Third Life, or Abatur; and he is the Father ofFetahil, who is the architect of the visible universe, which he calls intoexistence by the powers of his genii, at the order of the \"Greatest\"; the Abaturanswering to the \"Father\" of Jesus in the later Christian theology. These twosuperior Lives then, are the crown within which dwells the greatest Ferho.\"Before any creature came into existence the Lord Ferho existed.\" ** This one isthe First Life, formless and invisible; in whom the living Spirit of LIFEexists, the Highest GRACE. The two are ONE from eternity, for they are the Lightand the CAUSE of the Light. Therefore, they answer to the kabalistic concealedwisdom, and to the concealed Shekinah--the Holy Ghost. \"This light, which ismanifested, is the garment of the Heavenly Concealed,\" says Idra Suta. And the\"heavenly man\" is the superior Adam. \"No one knows his paths exceptMacroprosopus\" (Long-face)--the Superior active god. *** \"Not as I am writtenwill I be read; in this world my name will be written Jehovah and readAdonai,\" **** say the Rabbins, very correctly. Adonai is the Adam Kadmon; he isFATHER and MOTHER both. By this double mediatorship the Spirit of the \"Ancientof the Ancient\" descends upon the Microprosopus (Short-face) or the Adam ofEden. And the \"Lord God breathes into his nostrils the breath of life.\" When the woman separates herself from her androgyne, and becomes a distinctindividuality, the first story is repeated over again. Both the Father and Son,the two Adams, love her beauty; and then follows the allegory of the temptationand fall. It is in the Kabala, as in the Ophite system, in which both the Ophisand the Ophiomorphos are emanations emblematized as serpents, the formerrepresenting Eternity, Wisdom, and Spirit (as in the Chaldean Magism ofAspic-worship and Wisdom-Doctrine in the olden times), and the latter Cunning,Envy, and Matter. Both spirit and matter are serpents; and Adam Kadmon becomesthe Ophis who tempts himself--man and woman--to taste of the \"Tree of Good andEvil,\" in order to teach them the mysteries of spiritual wisdom. Light temptsDarkness, and Darkness attracts Light, for Darkness is matter, and \"the HighestLight shines not in its Tenebrae.\" With knowledge comes the temptation of theOphiomorphos, and he prevails. The dualism of every existing religion is shownforth by the fall. \"I have gotten a man from the Lord,\" exclaims Eve, when theDualism, Cain and Abel--evil and good--is born. \"And the Adam knew Hua, hiswoman (astu), and she became pregnant and bore Kin, and she said:[images/00054.jpg]: Kiniti ais Yava.--I have gained or obtained a husband, evenYava--Is, Ais--man.\" \"Cum arbore peccati Deus creavit seculum.\" And now we will compare this system with that of the Jewish Gnostics--theNazarenes, as well as with other philosophies. The ISH AMON, the pleroma, or the boundless circle within which lie \"all forms,\"is the THOUGHT of the power divine; it works in SILENCE, and suddenly light isbegotten by darkness; it is called the SECOND life; and this one produces, orgenerates the THIRD. This third light is \"the FATHER of all things that live,\"as EUA is the \"mother of all that live.\" He is the Creator who calls inertmatter into life, through his vivifying spirit, and, therefore, is called theancient of the world. Abatur is the Father who creates the first Adam, whocreates in his turn the second. Abatur opens a gate and walks to the dark water(chaos), and looking down into it, the darkness reflects the image of Himself .. . and lo! a SON is formed--the Logos or Demiurge; Fetahil, who is the builderof the material world, is called into existence. According to the Gnostic dogma,this was the Metatron, the Archangel Gabriel, or messenger of life; or, as thebiblical allegory has it, the androgynous Adam-Kadmon again, the SON, who, withhis Father's spirit, produces the ANOINTED, or Adam before his fall. When Swayambhuva, the \"Lord who exists through himself,\" feels impelled tomanifest himself, he is thus described in the Hindu sacred books. Having been impelled to produce various beings from his own divine substance, hefirst manifested the waters which developed within themselves a productive seed. The seed became a germ bright as gold, blazing like the luminary with a thousandbeams; and in that egg he was born himself, in the form of BRAHMA, the greatprinciple of all the beings (Manu, book i., slokas 8, 9). The Egyptian Kneph, or Chnuphis, Divine Wisdom, represented by a serpent,produces an egg from his mouth, from which issues Phtha. In this case Phtharepresents the universal germ, as well as Brahma, who is of the neuter gender,when the final a has a diaresis on it; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu104.htm#fn_431] otherwise it becomessimply one of the names of the Deity. The former was the model of the THREELIVES of the Nazarenes, as that of the kabalistic \"Faces,\" PHARAZUPHA, which, inits turn, furnished the model for the Christian Trinity of Irenaeus and hisfollowers. The egg was the primitive matter which served as a material for thebuilding of the visible universe; it contained, as well as the Gnostic Pleroma,the kabalistic Shekinah, the man and wife, the spirit and life, \"whose lightincludes all other lights\" or life-spirits. This first manifestation wassymbolized by a serpent, which is at first divine wisdom, but, falling intogeneration, becomes polluted. Phtha is the heavenly man, the EgyptianAdam-Kadmon, or Christ, who, in conjunction with the female Holy Ghost, the ZŒ,produces the five elements, air, water, fire, earth, and ether; the latter beinga servile copy from the Buddhist A'd, and his five Dhyana Buddhas, as we haveshown in the preceding chapter. The Hindu Swayambhuva-Nara, develops fromhimself the mother-principle, enclosed within his own divine essence--Nari, theimmortal Virgin, who, when impregnated by his spirit, becomes Tanmatra, themother of the five elements--air, water, fire, earth, and ether. Thus may beshown how from the Hindu cosmogony all others proceed. Knorr von Rosenroth, busying himself with the interpretation of the Kabala,argues that, \"In this first state (of secret wisdom), the infinite God Himselfcan be understood as 'Father' (of the new covenant). But the Light being letdown by the Infinite through a canal into the 'primal Adam,' or Messiah, andjoined with him, can be applied to the name SON. And the influx emitted downfrom him (the Son) to the lower parts (of the universe), can be applied to thecharacter of the Holy Ghost.\" ** Sophia-Achamoth, the half-spiritual,half-material LIFE, which vivifies the inert matter in the depths of chaos, isthe Holy Ghost of the Gnostics, and the Spiritus (female) of the Nazarenes. Sheis--be it remembered--the sister of Christos, the perfect emanation, and bothare children or emanations of Sophia, the purely spiritual and intellectualdaughter of Bythos, the Depth. For the elder Sophia is Shekinah, the Face ofGod, \"God's Shekinah, which is his image.\" * \"The Son Zeus-Belus, or Sol-Mithra is an image of the Father, an emanation fromthe Supreme Light,\" says Movers. \"He passed for Creator.\" ** \"Philosophers say the first air is anima mundi. But the garment (Shekinah) ishigher than the first air, since it is joined closer to the En-Soph, theBoundless.\" *** Thus Sophia is Shekinah, and Sophia-Achamoth the anima mundi,the astral light of the kabalists, which contains the spiritual and materialgerms of all that is. For the Sophia-Achamoth, like Eve, of whom she is theprototype, is \"the mother of all that live.\" There are three trinities in the Nazarene system as well as in the Hinduphilosophy of the ante and early Vedic period. While we see the few translatorsof the Kabala, the Nazarene Codex, and other abstruse works, hopelesslyfloundering amid the interminable pantheon of names, unable to agree as to asystem in which to classify them, for the one hypothesis contradicts andoverturns the other, we can but wonder at all this trouble, which could be soeasily overcome. But even now, when the translation, and even the perusal of theancient Sanscrit has become so easy as a point of comparison, they would neverthink it possible that every philosophy--whether Semitic, Hamitic, or Turanian,as they call it, has its key in the Hindu sacred works. Still facts are there,and facts are not easily destroyed. Thus, while we find the Hindu trimurtitriply manifested as Nara (or Para-Pouroucha), Agni, Brahma, the Father,Nari (Mariama), Vaya, Vishnu, the Mother,Viradj (Brahma), Surya, Siva, the Son,and the Egyptian trinity as follows: Kneph (or Amon), Osiris, Ra (Horus), the Father,Maut (or Mut), Isis, Isis, the Mother,Khons, Horus, Malouli, the Son; ****the Nazarene System runs, Ferho (Ish-Amon), Mano, Abatur, the Father,Chaos (dark water), Spiritus (female), Netubto, the Mother,Fetahil, Ledhaio, Lord Jordan, the Son.The first is the concealed or non-manifested trinity--a pure abstraction. Theother the active or the one revealed in the results of creation, proceeding outof the former--its spiritual prototype. The third is the mutilated image of boththe others, crystallized in the form of human dogmas, which vary according tothe exuberance of the national materialistic fancy. The Supreme Lord of splendor and of light, luminous and refulgent, before whichno other existed, is called Corona (the crown); Lord Ferho, the unrevealed lifewhich existed in the former from eternity; and Lord Jordan--the spirit, theliving water of grace. * He is the one through whom alone we can be saved; andthus he answers to the Shekinah, the spiritual garment of En-Soph, or the HolyGhost. These three constitute the trinity abscondito. The second trinity iscomposed of the three lives. The first is the similitude of Lord Ferho, throughwhom he has proceeded forth; and the second Ferho is the King of Light--MANO(Rex Lucis). He is the heavenly life and light, and older than the Architect ofheaven and earth. ** The second life is Ish Amon (Pleroma), the vase ofelection, containing the visible thought of the Iordanus Maximus--the type (orits intelligible reflection), the prototype of the living water, who is the\"spiritual Jordan.\" *** Third life, which is produced by the other two, isABATUR (Ab, the Parent or Father). This is the mysterious and decrepit \"Aged ofthe Aged,\" the \"Ancient Senem sui obtegentem et grandaevum mundi.\" This latterthird Life is the Father of the Demiurge Fetahil, the Creator of the world, whomthe Ophites call Ilda-Baoth, **** though Fetahil is the only-begotten one, thereflection of the Father, Abatur, who begets him by looking into the \"darkwater\"; *****but the Lord Mano, \"the Lord of loftiness, the Lord of all genii,\"is higher than the Father, in this kabalistic Codex--one is purely spiritual,the other material. So, for instance, while Abatur's \"only begotten\" one is thegenius Fetahil, the Creator of the physical world, Lord Mano, the \"Lord ofCelsitude,\" who is the son of Him, who is \"the Father of all who preach theGospel,\" produces also an \"only-begotten\" one, the Lord Lehdaio, \"a just Lord.\"He is the Christos, the anointed, who pours out the \"grace\" of the InvisibleJordan, the Spirit of the Highest Crown. In the Arcanum, \"in the assembly of splendor, lighted by MANO, to whom thescintillas of splendor owe their origin,\" the genii who live in light \"rose,they went to the visible Jordan, and flowing water . . . they assembled for acounsel . . . and called forth the Only-Begotten Son of an imperishable image,and who cannot be conceived by reflection, Lebdaio, the just Lord, and sprungfrom Lebdaio, the just lord, whom the life had produced by his word.\" * Mano is the chief of the seven Æons, who are Mano (Rex Lucis), Aiar Zivo, IgnisVivus, Lux, Vita, Aqua Viva (the living water of baptism, the genius of theJordan), and Ipsa Vita, the chief of the six genii, which form with him themystic seven. The Nazarene Mano is simply the copy of the Hindu first Manu--theemanation of Manu Swayambhuva--from whom evolve in succession the six otherManus, types of the subsequent races of men. We find them all represented by theapostle-kabalist John in the \"seven lamps of fire\" burning before the throne,which are the seven spirits of God,\" ** and in the seven angels bearing theseven vials. Again in Fetahil we recognize the original of the Christiandoctrine. In the Revelation of Joannes Theologos it is said: \"I turned and saw in themidst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man . . . his head andhis hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flameof fire . . . and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace\"(i. 13, 14, 15). John here repeats, as is well known, the words of Daniel andEzekiel. \"The Ancient of Days . . . whose hair was white as pure wool . . .etc.\" And \"the appearance of a man . . . above the throne . . . and theappearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.\" ***The fire being \"theglory of the Lord.\" Fetahil is son of the man, the Third Life, and his upperpart is represented as white as snow, while standing near the throne of theliving fire he has the appearance of a flame. All these \"apocalyptic\" visions are based on the description of the \"white head\"of the Sohar, in whom the kabalistic trinity is united. The white head, \"whichconceals in its cranium the spirit,\" and which is environed by subtile fire. The\"appearance of a man\" is that of Adam Kadmon, through which passes the thread oflight represented by the fire. Fetahil is the Vir Novissimus (the newest man),the son of Abatur, **** the latter being the \"man,\" or the third life, ***** nowthe third personage of the trinity. John sees \"one like unto the son of man,\"holding in his right hand seven stars, and standing between \"seven goldencandlesticks\" (Revelation i.). Fetahil takes his \"stand on high,\" according tothe will of his father, \"the highest Æon who has seven sceptres,\" and sevengenii, who astronomically represent the seven planets or stars. He stands\"shining in the garment of the Lord's, resplendent by the agency of thegenii.\" * He is the Son of his Father, Life, and his mother, Spirit, orLight. ** The Logos is represented in the Gospel according to John as one inwhom was \"Life, and the life was the light of men\" (i. 4). Fetahil is theDemiurge, and his father created the visible universe of matter throughhim. ***In the Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians (iii. 9), God is said to have\"created all things by Jesus.\" In the Codex the Parent-LIFE says: \"Arise, go,our son first-begotten, ordained for all creatures.\" **** \"As the living fatherhath sent me,\" says Christ, \"God sent his only-begotten son that we mightlive.\" ***** Finally, having performed his work on earth, Fetahil reascends tohis father Abatur. \"Et qui, relicto quem procreavit mundo, ad Abatur suum patremcontendit,\" ****** \"My father sent me . . . I go to the Father,\" repeats Jesus. Laying aside the theological disputes of Christianity which try to blendtogether the Jewish Creator of the first chapter of Genesis with the \"Father\" ofthe New Testament, Jesus states repeatedly of his Father that \"He is in secret.\"Surely he would not have so termed the ever-present \"Lord God\" of the Mosaicbooks, who showed Himself to Moses and the Patriarchs, and finally allowed allthe elders of Israel to look on Himself. ******* When Jesus is made to speak ofthe temple at Jerusalem as of his \"Father's house,\" he does not mean thephysical building, which he maintains he can destroy and then again rebuild inthree days, but of the temple of Solomon; the wise kabalist, who indicates inhis Proverbs that every man is the temple of God, or of his own divine spirit.This term of the \"Father who is in secret,\" we find used as much in the Kabalaas in the Codex Nazaraeus, and elsewhere. No one has ever seen the wisdomconcealed in the \"Cranium,\" and no one has beheld the \"Depth\" (Bythos). Simon,the Magician, preached \"one Father unknown to all.\" ******** We can trace this appellation of a \"secret\" God still farther back. In theKabala the \"Son\" of the concealed Father who dwells in light and glory, is the\"Anointed,\" the Seir-Anpin, who unites in himself all the Sephiroth, he isChristos, or the Heavenly man. It is through Christ that the Pneuma, or the HolyGhost, creates \"all things\" (Ephesians iii. 9), and produces the four elements,air, water, fire, and earth. This assertion is unquestionable, for we findIrenaeus basing on this fact his best argument for the necessity of there beingfour gospels. There can be neither more nor fewer than four--he argues. \"For asthere are four quarters of the world, and four general winds (Καθολικα Πνευματα). . . it is right that she (the Church) should have four pillars. From which itis manifest that the Word, the maker of all, he who sitteth upon the Cherubim .. . as David says, supplicating his advent, 'Thou that sittest between theCherubim, shine forth!' For the Cherubim also are four-faced and their faces aresymbols of the working of the Son of God.\" * We will not stop to discuss at length the special holiness of the four-facedCherubim, although we might, perhaps, show their origin in all the ancientpagodas of India, in the vehans (or vehicles) of their chief gods; as likewisewe might easily attribute the respect paid to them to the kabalistic wisdom,which, nevertheless, the Church rejects with great horror. But, we cannot resistthe temptation to remind the reader that he may easily ascertain the severalsignificances attributed to these Cherubs by reading the Kabala. \"When the soulsare to leave their abode,\" says the Sohar, holding to the doctrine of thepre-existence of souls in the world of emanations, \"each soul separately appearsbefore the Holy King, dressed in a sublime form, with the features in which itis to appear in this world. It is from this sublime form that the imageproceeds\" (Sohar, iii., p. 104 ab). Then it goes on to say that the types orforms of these faces \"are four in number--those of the angel or man, of thelion, the bull, and the eagle.\" Furthermore, we may well express our wonder thatIrenaeus should not have re-enforced his argument for the four gospels--byciting the whole Pantheon of the four-armed Hindu gods! Ezekiel in representing his four animals, now called Cherubim, as types of thefour symbolical beings, which, in his visions support the throne of Jehovah, hadnot far to go for his models. The Chaldeo-Babylonian protecting genii werefamiliar to him; the Sed, Alap or Kirub (Cherubim), the bull, with the humanface; the Nirgal, human-headed lion; Oustour the Sphinx-man; and the Nathga,with its eagle's head. The religion of the masters--the idolatrous Babyloniansand Assyrians--was transferred almost bodily into the revealed Scripture of theCaptives, and from thence came into Christianity. Already, we find Ezekiel addressed by the likeness of the glory of the Lord, \"asSon of man.\" This peculiar title is used repeatedly throughout the whole book ofthis prophet, which is as kabalistic as the \"roll of a book\" which the \"Glory\"causes him to eat. It is written within and without; and its real meaning isidentical with that of the Apocalypse. It appears strange that so much stressshould be laid on this peculiar appellation, said to have been applied by Jesusto himself, when, in the symbolical or kabalistic language, a prophet is soaddressed. It is as extraordinary to see Irenaeus indulging in such graphicdescriptions of Jesus as to show him, \"the maker of all, sitting upon aCherubim,\" unless he identifies him with Shekinah, whose usual place was amongthe Charoubs of the Mercy Seat. We also know that the Cherubim and Seraphim aretitles of the \"Old Serpent\" (the orthodox Devil) the Seraphs being the burningor fiery serpents, in kabalistic symbolism. The ten emanations of Adam Kadmon,called the Sephiroth, have all emblems and titles corresponding to each. So, forinstance, the last two are Victory, or Jehovah-Sabaoth, whose symbol is theright column of Solomon, the Pillar Jachin; while GLORY is the left Pillar, orBoaz, and its name is \"the Old Serpent,\" and also \"Seraphim and Cherubim.\" * The \"Son of man\" is an appellation which could not be assumed by any one but akabalist. Except, as shown above, in the Old Testament, it is used but by oneprophet--Ezekiel, the kabalist. In their mysterious and mutual relations, theÆons or Sephiroth are represented in the Kabala by a great number of circles,and sometimes by the figure of a MAN, which is symbolically formed out of suchcircles. This man is Seir-Anpin, and the 243 numbers of which his figureconsists relate to the different orders of the celestial hierarchy. The originalidea of this figure, or rather the model, may have been taken from the HinduBrahma, and the various castes typified by the several parts of his body, asKing suggests in his Gnostics. In one of the grandest and most beautifulcave-temples at Ellora, Nasak, dedicated to Vishvakarma, son of Brahma, is arepresentation of this God and his attributes. To one acquainted with Ezekiel'sdescription of the \"likeness of four living creatures,\" every one of which hadfour faces and the hands of a man under its wings, etc., ** this figure atEllora must certainly appear absolutely biblical. Brahma is called the father of\"man,\" as well as Jupiter and other highest gods. It is in the Buddhistic representations of Mount Meru, called by the BurmeseMye-nmo, and by the Siamese Sineru, that we find one of the originals of theAdam Kadmon, Seir-Anpin, the \"heavenly man,\" and of all the Æons, Sephiroth,Powers, Dominions, Thrones, Virtues, and Dignities of the Kabala. Between twopillars, which are connected by an arch, the key-stone of the latter isrepresented by a crescent. This is the domain in which dwells the Supreme Wisdomof A'di Buddha, the Supreme and invisible Deity. Beneath this highest centralpoint comes the circle of the direct emanation of the Unknown--the circle ofBrahma with some Hindus, of the first avatar of Buddha, according to others.This answers to Adam Kadmon and the ten Sephiroth. Nine of the emanations areencircled by the tenth, and occasionally represented by pagodas, each of whichbears a name which expresses one of the chief attributes of the manifestedDeity. Then below come the seven stages, or heavenly spheres, each sphere beingencircled by a sea. These are the celestial mansions of the devatas, or gods,each losing somewhat in holiness and purity as it approaches the earth. Thencomes Meru itself, formed of numberless circles within three large ones,typifying the trinity of man; and for one acquainted with the numerical value ofthe letters in biblical names, like that of the \"Great Beast,\" or that of MithraΜιθρας αβραχας, and others, it is an easy matter to establish the identity ofthe Meru-gods with the emanations or Sephiroth of the kabalists. Also the geniiof the Nazarenes, with their special missions, are all found on this mostancient mythos, a most perfect representation of the symbolism of the \"secretdoctrine,\" as taught in archaic ages. King gives a few hints--though doubtless too insufficient to teach anythingimportant, for they are based upon the calculations of Bishop Newton *--as tothis mode of finding out mysteries in the value of letters. However, we findthis great archaeologist, who has devoted so much time and labor to the study ofGnostic gems, corroborating our assertion. He shows that the entire theory isHindu, and points out that the durga, or female counterpart of each Asiatic god,is what the kabalists term active Virtue ** in the celestial hierarchy, a termwhich the Christian Fathers adopted and repeated, without fully appreciating,and the meaning of which the later theology has utterly disfigured. But toreturn to Meru. The whole is surrounded by the Maha Samut, or the great sea--the astral lightand ether of the kabalists and scientists; and within the central circlesappears \"the likeness of a man.\" He is the Achadoth of the Nazarenes, thetwofold unity, or the androgyne man; the heavenly incarnation, and a perfectrepresentation of Seir-Anpin (short-face), the son, of Arich Anpin(long-face). * This likeness is now represented in many lamaseries byGautama-Buddha, the last of the incarnated avatars. Still lower, under the Meru,is the dwelling of the great Naga, who is called Rajah Naga, theking-serpent--the serpent of Genesis, the Gnostic Ophis--and the goddess of theearth, Bhumay Nari, or Yama, who waits upon the great dragon, for she is Eve,\"the mother of all that live.\" Still lower is the eighth sphere, the infernalregions. The uppermost regions of Brahma are surrounded by the sun, moon, andplanets, the seven stellars of the Nazarenes, and just as they are described inthe Codex. \"The seven impostor-Daemons who deceive the sons of Adam. The name of one isSol; of another Spiritus Venereus, Astro; of the third Nebu, Mercurius a falseMessiah; . . . the name of a fourth is Sin Luna; the fifth is Kiun, Saturnus;the sixth, Bel-Zeus; the seventh, Nerig-Mars.\" **Then there are \"Seven Livesprocreated,\" seven good Stellars, \"which are from Cabar Zio, and are thosebright ones who shine in their own form and splendor that pours from on high. .. . At the gate of the HOUSE OF LIFE the throne is fitly placed for the Lord ofSplendor, and there are THREE habitations.\" *** The habitations of the Trimurti,the Hindu trinity, are placed beneath the key-stone--the golden crescent, in therepresentation of Meru. \"And there was under his feet (of the God of Israel) asit were a paved work of a sapphire-stone\" (Exodus xxiv. 10). Under the crescentis the heaven of Brahma, all paved with sapphires. The paradise of Indra isresplendent with a thousand suns; that of Siva (Saturn), is in the northeast;his throne is formed of lapis-lazuli and the floor of heaven is of fervid gold.\"When he sits on the throne he blazes with fire up to the loins.\" At Hurdwar,during the fair, in which he is more than ever Mahadeva, the highest god, theattributes and emblems sacred to the Jewish \"Lord God,\" may be recognized one byone in those of Siva. The Binlang stone, **** sacred to this Hindu deity, is anunhewn stone like the Beth-el, consecrated by the Patriarch Jacob, and set up byhim \"for a pillar,\" and like the latter Binlang is anointed. We need hardlyremind the student that the linga, the emblem sacred to Siva and whose templesare modelled after this form, is identical in shape, meaning, and purpose withthe \"pillars\" set up by the several patriarchs to mark their adoration of theLord God. In fact, one of these patriarchal lithoi might even now be carried inthe Sivaitic processions of Calcutta, without its Hebrew derivation beingsuspected. The four arms of Siva are often represented with appendages likewings; he has three eyes and a fourth in the crescent, obtained by him at thechurning of the ocean, as Pancha Mukhti Siva has four heads. In this god we recognize the description given by Ezekiel, in the first chapterof his book, of his vision, in which he beholds the \"likeness of a man\" in thefour living creatures, who had \"four faces, four wings,\" who had one pair of\"straight feet . . . which sparkled like the color of burnished brass . . . andtheir rings were full of eyes round about them four.\" It is the throne andheaven of Siva that the prophet describes in saying \" . . . and there was thelikeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone . . . and I saw asthe color of amber (gold) as the appearance of fire around about . . . from hisloins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw asit were the appearance of fire\" (Ezekiel i. 27). \"And his feet like unto finebrass, as if they burned in a furnace\" (Revelation i. 15). \"As for their faces .. . one had the face of a cherub, and the face of a lion . . . they also had theface of an ox and the face of an eagle\" (Ezekiel i. 10, x. 14). This fourfoldappearance which we find in the two cherubims of gold on the two ends of theark; these symbolic four faces being adopted, moreover, later, one by eachevangelist, as may be easily ascertained from the pictures of Matthew, Mark,Luke, and John, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu104.htm#fn_464] prefixedto their respective gospels in the Roman Vulgate and Greek Bibles. \"Taaut, the great god of the Phoenicians,\" says Sanchoniathon, \"to express thecharacter of Saturn or Kronos, made his image having four eyes . . . two before,two behind, open and closed, and four wings, two expanded, two folded. The eyesdenote that the god sees in sleep, and sleeps in waking; the position of thewings that he flies in rest, and rests in flying.\" The identity of Saturn with Siva is corroborated still more when we consider theemblem of the latter, the damara, which is an hour-glass, to show the progressof time, represented by this god in his capacity of a destroyer. The bull Nardi,the vehan of Siva and the most sacred emblem of this god, is reproduced in theEgyptian Apis; and in the bull created by Ormazd and killed by Ahriman. Thereligion of Zoroaster, all based upon the \"secret doctrine,\" is found held bythe people of Eritene; it was the religion of the Persians when they conqueredthe Assyrians. From thence it is easy to trace the introduction of this emblemof LIFE represented by the Bull, in every religious system. The college of theMagians had accepted it with the change of dynasty; * Daniel is described as aRabbi, the chief of the Babylonian astrologers and Magi; ** therefore we see theAssyrian little bulls and the attributes of Siva reappearing under a hardlymodified form in the cherubs of the Talmudistic Jews, as we have traced the bullApis in the sphinxes or cherubs of the Mosaic Ark; and as we find it severalthousand years later in the company of one of the Christian evangelists, Luke. Whoever has lived in India long enough to acquaint himself even superficiallywith the native deities, must detect the similarity between Jehovah and othergods besides Siva. As Saturn, the latter was always held in great respect by theTalmudists. He was held in reverence by the Alexandrian kabalists as the directinspirer of the law and the prophets; one of the names of Saturn was Israel, andwe will show, in time, his identity in a certain way with Abram, which Moversand others hinted at long since. Thus it cannot be wondered at if Valentinus,Basilides, and the Ophite Gnostics placed the dwelling of their Ilda-Baoth, alsoa destroyer as well as a creator, in the planet Saturn; for it was he who gavethe law in the wilderness and spoke through the prophets. If more proof shouldbe required we will show it in the testimony of the canonical Bible itself. InAmos the \"Lord\" pours vials of wrath upon the people of Israel. He rejects theirburnt-offerings and will not listen to their prayers, but inquires of Amos,\"have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years,O house of Israel?\" \"But ye have borne the tabernacles of your Moloch and Chiunyour images, the star of your god\" (v. 25, 26). Who are Moloch and Chiun butBaal--Saturn--Siva, and Chiun, Kivan, the same Saturn whose star the Israeliteshad made to themselves? There seems no escape in this case; all these deitiesare identical. The same in the case of the numerous Logoi. While the Zoroastrian Sosiosh isframed on that of the tenth Brahmanical Avatar, and the fifth Buddha of thefollowers of Gautama; and we find the former, after having passed part andparcel into the kabalistic system of king Messiah, reflected in the ApostleGabriel of the Nazarenes, and Æbel-Zivo, the Legatus, sent on earth by the Lordof Celsitude and Light; all of these --Hindu and Persian, Buddhist and Jewish,the Christos of the Gnostics and the Philonean Logos--are found combined in \"theWord made flesh\" of the fourth Gospel. Christianity includes all these systems,patched and arranged to meet the occasion. Do we take up the Avesta--we findthere the dual system so prevalent in the Christian scheme. The struggle betweenAhriman, * Darkness, and Ormazd, Light, has been going on in the worldcontinually since the beginning of time. When the worst arrives and Ahriman willseem to have conquered the world and corrupted all mankind, then will appear theSaviour of mankind, Sosiosh. He will come seated upon a white horse and followedby an army of good genii equally mounted on milk-white steeds. ** And this wefind faithfully copied in the Revelation: \"I saw heaven opened, and beheld awhite horse; and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true. . . . Andthe armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses\" (Revelation xix.11, 14). Sosiosh himself is but a later Persian permutation of the Hindu Vishnu.The figure of this god may be found unto this day representing him as theSaviour, the \"Preserver\" (the preserving spirit of God), in the temple of Rama.The picture shows him in his tenth incarnation--the Kalki avatar, which is yetto come--as an armed warrior mounted upon a white horse. Waving over his headthe sword destruction, he holds in his other hand a discus, made up of ringsencircled in one another, an emblem of the revolving cycles or great ages, ***for Vishnu will thus appear but at the end of the Kaliyug, answering to the endof the world expected by our Adventists. \"And out of his mouth goeth a sharpsword . . . on his head were many crowns\" (Revelation xix. 12). Vishnu is oftenrepresented with several crowns superposed on his head. \"And I saw an angelstanding on the Sun\" (17). The white horse is the horse of the Sun. ****Sosiosh, the Persian Saviour, is also born of a virgin, ***** and at the end ofdays he will come as a Redeemer to regenerate the world, but he will be precededby two prophets, who will come to announce him. ****** Hence the Jews who hadMoses and Elias, are now waiting for the Messiah. \"Then comes the generalresurrection, when the good will immediately enter into this happy abode--theregenerated earth; and Ahriman and his angels (the devils), * and the wicked, bepurified by immersion in a lake of molten metal. . . . Henceforward, all willenjoy unchangeable happiness, and, headed by Sosiosh, ever sing the praises ofthe Eternal One.\" ** The above is a perfect repetition of Vishnu in his tenthavatar, for he will then throw the wicked into the infernal abodes in which,after purifying themselves, they will be pardoned--even those devils whichrebelled against Brahma, and were hurled into the bottomless pit by Siva, *** asalso the \"blessed ones\" will go to dwell with the gods, over the Mount Meru. Having thus traced the similarity of views respecting the Logos, Metatron, andMediator, as found in the Kabala and the Codex of the Christian Nazarenes andGnostics, the reader is prepared to appreciate the audacity of the Patristicscheme to reduce a purely metaphysical figure into concrete form, and make itappear as if the finger of prophecy had from time immemorial been pointing downthe vista of ages to Jesus as the coming Messiah. A theomythos intended tosymbolize the coming day, near the close of the great cycle, when the \"gladtidings\" from heaven should proclaim the universal brotherhood and common faithof humanity, the day of regeneration--was violently distorted into anaccomplished fact. \"Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is God,\" says Jesus.Is this the language of a God? of the second person in the Trinity, who isidentical with the First? And if this Messiah, or Holy Ghost of the Gnostic andPagan Trinities, had come in his person, what did he mean by distinguishingbetween himself the \"Son of man,\" and the Holy Ghost? \"And whosoever shall speaka word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but unto him thatblasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven,\" he says. **** Andhow account for the marvellous identity of this very language, with the preceptsenunciated, centuries before, by the Kabalists and the \"Pagan\" initiates? Thefollowing are a few instances out of many. \"No one of the gods, no man or Lord, can be good, but only God alone,\" saysHermes. ***** \"To be a good man is impossible, God alone possesses this privilege,\" repeatsPlato, with a slight variation. * Six centuries before Christ, the Chinese philosopher Confucius said that hisdoctrine was simple and easy to comprehend (Lun-yu, chap. 5, § 15). To which oneof his disciples added: \"The doctrine of our Master consists in having aninvariable correctness of heart, and in doing toward others as we would thatthey should do to us.\" ** \"Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles,\" *** exclaimsPeter, long after the scene of Calvary. \"There was a man sent from God, whosename was John,\" **** says the fourth Gospel, thus placing the Baptist on anequality with Jesus. John the Baptist, in one of the most solemn acts of hislife, that of baptizing Christ, thinks not that he is going to baptize a God,but uses the word man. \"This is he of whom I said, after me cometh a man.\" *****Speaking of himself, Jesus says, \"You seek to kill me, a man that hath told youthe truth, which I have heard of God. ****** Even the blind man of Jerusalem,healed by the great thaumaturgist, full of gratitude and admiration for hisbenefactor, in narrating the miracle does not call Jesus God, but simply says,\". . . a man that is called Jesus, made clay.\" ******* We do not close the list for lack of other instances and proofs, but simplybecause what we now say has been repeated and demonstrated by others, many timesbefore us. But there is no more incurable evil than blind and unreasoningfanaticism. Few are the men who, like Dr. Priestley, have the courage to write,\"We find nothing like divinity ascribed to Christ before Justin Martyr (A. D.141), who, from being a philosopher, became a Christian.\" ******** Mahomet appeared nearly six hundred years ********* after the presumed deicide.The Graeco-Roman world was still convulsed with religious dissensions,withstanding all the past imperial edicts and forcible Christianization. Whilethe Council of Trent was disputing about the Vulgate, the unity of God quietlysuperseded the trinity, and soon the Mahometans outnumbered the Christians. Why?Because their prophet never sought to identify himself with Allah. Otherwise, itis safe to say, he would not have lived to see his religion flourish. Till thepresent day Mahometanism has made and is now making more proselytes thanChristianity. Buddha Siddhartha came as a simple mortal, centuries beforeChrist. The religious ethics of this faith are now found to far exceed in moralbeauty anything ever dreamed of by the Tertullians and Augustines. The true spirit of Christianity can alone be fully found in Buddhism; partially,it shows itself in other \"heathen\" religions. Buddha never made of himself agod, nor was he deified by his followers. The Buddhists are now known to faroutnumber Christians; they are enumerated at nearly 500,000,000. While cases ofconversion among Buddhists, Brahmanists, Mahometans, and Jews become so rare asto show how sterile are the attempts of our missionaries, atheism andmaterialism spread their gangrenous ulcers and gnaw every day deeper at the veryheart of Christianity. There are no atheists among heathen populations, andthose few among the Buddhists and Brahmans who have become infected withmaterialism may always be found to belong to large cities densely thronged withEuropeans, and only among educated classes. Truly says Bishop Kidder: \"Were awise man to choose his religion from those who profess it, perhaps Christianitywould be the last religion he would choose!\" In an able little pamphlet from the pen of the popular lecturer, J. M. Peebles,M.D., the author quotes, from the London Athenaeum, an article in which aredescribed the welfare and civilization of the inhabitants of Yarkand andKashgar, \"who seem virtuous and happy.\" \"Gracious Heavens!\" fervently exclaimsthe honest author, who himself was once a Universalist clergyman, \"Grant to keepChristian missionaries away from 'happy' and heathen Tartary!\" * From the earliest days of Christianity, when Paul upbraided the Church ofCorinth for a crime \"as is not so much as named among the Gentiles--that oneshould have his father's wife\"; and for their making a pretext of the \"Lord'sSupper\" for debauch and drunkenness (1 Corinthians, v. 1), the profession of thename of Christ has ever been more a pretext than the evidence of holy feeling.However, a correct form of this verse is: \"Everywhere the lewd practice amongyou is heard about, such a lewd practice as is nowhere among the heathennations--even the having or marrying of the father's wife.\" The Persianinfluence would seem to be indicated in this language. The practice existed\"nowhere among the nations,\" except in Persia, where it was esteemed especiallymeritorious. Hence, too, the Jewish stories of Abraham marrying his sister,Nahor, his niece, Amram his father's sister, and Judah his son's widow, whosechildren appear to have been legitimate. The Aryan tribes esteemed endogamicmarriages, while the Tartars and all barbarous nations required all alliances tobe exogamous. There was but one apostle of Jesus worthy of that name, and that was Paul.However disfigured were his Epistles by dogmatic hands before being admittedinto the Canon, his conception of the great and divine figure of the philosopherwho died for his idea can still be traced in his addresses to the variousGentile nations. Only, he who would understand him better yet must study thePhilonean Logos reflecting now and then the Hindu Sabda (logos) of the Mimansaschool. As to the other apostles, those whose names are prefixed to the Gospels--wecannot well believe in their veracity when we find them attributing to theirMaster miracles surrounded by circumstances, recorded, if not in the oldestbooks of India, at least in such as antedated Christianity, and in the veryphraseology of the traditions. Who, in his days of simple and blind credulity,but marvelled at the touching narrative given in the Gospels according to Markand Luke of the resurrection of the daughter of Jairus? Who has ever doubted itsoriginality? And yet the story is copied entirely from the Hari-Purana, and isrecorded among the miracles attributed to Christna. We translate it from theFrench version: \"The King Angashuna caused the betrothal of his daughter, the beautifulKalavatti, with the young son of Vamadeva, the powerful King of Antarvedi, namedGovinda, to be celebrated with great pomp. \"But as Kalavatti was amusing herself in the groves with her companions, she wasstung by a serpent and died. Angashuna tore his clothes, covered himself withashes, and cursed the day when he was born. \"Suddenly, a great rumor spread through the palace, and the following cries wereheard, a thousand times repeated: 'Pacya pitaram; pacya gurum!' 'The Father, theMaster!' Then Christna approached, smiling, leaning on the arm of Ardjuna. . . .'Master!' cried Angashuna, casting himself at his feet, and sprinkling them withhis tears, 'See my poor daughter!' and he showed him the body of Kalavatti,stretched upon a mat. . . . \" 'Why do you weep?' replied Christna, in a gentle voice. 'Do you not see thatshe is sleeping? Listen to the sound of her breathing, like the sigh of thenight wind which rustles the leaves of the trees. See, her cheeks resuming theircolor, her eyes, whose lids tremble as if they were about to open; her lipsquiver as if about to speak; she is sleeping, I tell you; and hold! see, shemoves, Kalavatti! Rise and walk!' \"Hardly had Christna spoken, when the breathing, warmth, movement, and lifereturned little by little, into the corpse, and the young girl, obeying theinjunction of the demi-god, rose from her couch and rejoined her companions. Butthe crowd marvelled and cried out: 'This is a god, since death is no more forhim than sleep!' \" * All such parables are enforced upon Christians, with the addition of dogmaswhich, in their extraordinary character, leave far behind them the wildestconceptions of heathenism. The Christians, in order to believe in a Deity, havefound it necessary to kill their God, that they themselves should live! And now, the Supreme, unknown one, the Father of grace and mercy, and hiscelestial hierarchy are managed by the Church as though they were so manytheatrical stars and supernumeraries under salary! Six centuries before theChristian era, Xenophanes had disposed of such anthropomorphism by an immortalsatire, recorded and preserved by Clement of Alexandria. \"There is one God Supreme. . . . . . . . .Whose form is not like unto man's, and as unlike his nature;But vain mortals imagine that gods like themselves are begottenWith human sensations, and voice, and corporeal members;So if oxen or lions had hands and could work in man's fashionAnd trace out with chisel or brush their conception of GodheadThen would horses depict gods like horses, and oxen like oxen,Each kind the Divine with its own form and nature endowing.\" **And hear Vyasa--the poet-pantheist of India, who, for all the scientists canprove, may have lived, as Jacolliot has it, some fifteen thousand yearsago--discoursing on Maya, the illusion of the senses: \"All religious dogmas only serve to obscure the intelligence of man. . . .Worship of divinities, under the allegories of which, is hidden respect fornatural laws, drives away truth to the profit of the basest superstitions\"(Vyasa Maya). It was given to Christianity to paint us God Almighty after the model of thekabalistic abstraction of the \"Ancient of Days.\" From old frescos on cathedralceilings; Catholic missals, and other icons and images, we now find him depictedby the poetic brush of Gustave Dore. The awful, unknown majesty of Him, whom no\"heathen\" dared to reproduce in concrete form, is figuring in our own century inDore's Illustrated Bible. Treading upon clouds that float in mid-air, darknessand chaos behind him and the world beneath his feet, a majestic old man stands,his left hand gathering his flowing robes about him, and his right raised in thegesture of command. He has spoken the Word, and from his towering person streamsan effulgence of Light--the Shekinah. As a poetic conception, the compositiondoes honor to the artist, but does it honor God? Better, the chaos behind Him,than the figure itself; for there, at least, we have a solemn mystery. For ourpart, we prefer the silence of the ancient heathens. With such a gross,anthropomorphic, and, as we conceive, blasphemous representation of the FirstCause, who can feel surprised at any iconographic extravagance in therepresentation of the Christian Christ, the apostles, and the putative Saints?With the Catholics St. Peter becomes quite naturally the janitor of Heaven, andsits at the door of the celestial kingdom--a ticket-taker to the Trinity! In a religious disturbance which recently occurred in one of theSpanish-American provinces, there were found upon the bodies of some of thekilled, passports signed by the Bishop of the Diocese and addressed to St.Peter; bidding him \"admit the bearer as a true son of the Church.\" It wassubsequently ascertained that these unique documents were issued by the Catholicprelate just before his deluded parishioners went into the fight at theinstigation of their priests. In their immoderate desire to find evidence for the authenticity of the NewTestament, the best men, the most erudite scholars even among Protestantdivines, but too often fall into deplorable traps. We cannot believe that such alearned commentator as Canon Westcott could have left himself in ignorance as toTalmudistic and purely kabalistic writings. How then is it that we find himquoting, with such serene assurance as presenting \"striking analogies to theGospel of St. John,\" passages from the work of The Pastor of Hermas, which arecomplete sentences from the kabalistic literature? \"The view which Hermas givesof Christ's nature and work is no less harmonious with apostolic doctrine, andit offers striking analogies to the Gospel of St. John. . . . He (Jesus) is arock higher than the mountains, able to hold the whole world, ancient, and yethaving a new gate! . . . He is older than creation, so that he took counsel withthe Father about the creation which he made. . . . No one shall enter in untohim otherwise than by his Son.\" * Now while--as the author of Supernatural Religion well proves --there is nothingin this which looks like a corroboration of the doctrine taught in the fourthgospel, he omits to state that nearly everything expressed by the pseudo-Hermasin relation to his parabolic conversation with the \"Lord\" is a plain quotation,with repeated variations, from the Sohar and other kabalistic books. We may aswell compare, so as to leave the reader in no difficulty to judge for himself. \"God,\" says Hermas, \"planted the vineyard, that is, He created the people andgave them to His Son; and the Son . . . himself cleansed their sins, etc.\";i.e., the Son washed them in his blood, in commemoration of which Christiansdrink wine at the communion. In the Kabala it is shown that the Aged of theAged, or \"Long-Face,\" plants a vineyard, the latter typifying mankind; and avine, meaning Life. The Spirit of \"King Messiah\" is, therefore, shown as washinghis garments in the wine from above, from the creation of the world. * Adam, orA-Dam is \"blood.\" The life of the flesh is in the blood (nephesh--soul),Leviticus xvii. And Adam-Kadmon is the Only-Begotten. Noah also plants avineyard--the allegorical hot-bed of future humanity. As a consequence of theadoption of the same allegory, we find it reproduced in the Nazarene Codex.Seven vines are procreated, which spring from Iukabar Ziva, and Ferho (orParcha) Raba waters them. ** When the blessed will ascend among the creatures ofLight, they shall see Iavar-Zivo, Lord of LIFE, and the First VINE! *** Thesekabalistic metaphors are thus naturally repeated in the Gospel according to John(xv. 1): \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.\" In Genesis(xlix.), the dying Jacob is made to say, \"The sceptre shall not depart fromJudah (the lion's whelp), nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh(Siloh) comes. . . . Binding his colt unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto thechoice vine, he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood ofgrapes.\" Shiloh is \"King Messiah,\" as well as the Shiloh in Ephraim, which wasto be made the capital and the place of the sanctuary. In The Targum of Onkelos,the Babylonian, the words of Jacob read: \"Until the King Messiah shall come.\"The prophecy has failed in the Christian as well as in the kabalistico-Jewishsense. The sceptre has departed from Judah, whether the Messiah has already orwill come, unless we believe, with the kabalists, that Moses was the firstMessiah, who transferred his soul to Joshua--Jesus. **** Says Hermas: \"And, in the middle of the plain, he showed me a great white rock,which had risen out of the plain, and the rock was higher than the mountains,rectangular, so as to be able to hold the whole world; but that rock was old,having a gate hewn out of it, and the hewing out of the gate seemed to me to berecent.\" In the Sohar, we find: \"To 40,000 superior worlds the white of theskull of His Head (of the most Sacred Ancient in absconditus) is extended. * . .. When Seir (the first reflection and image of his Father, the Ancient of theAncient) will, through the mystery of the seventy names of Metatron, descendinto Iezirah (the third world), he will open a new gate. . . . The SpiritusDecisorius will cut and divide the garment (Shekinah) into two parts. ** . . .At the coming of King Messiah, from the sacred cubical stone of the Temple awhite light will be arising during forty days. This will expand, until itencloses the whole world. . . . At that time King Messiah will allow himself tobe revealed, and will be seen coming out of the gate of the garden of Odan(Eden). 'He will be revealed in the land Galil.' *** . . . When 'he has madesatisfaction for the sins of Israel, he will lead them on through a new gate tothe seat of judgment.' **** At the Gate of the House of Life, the throne isprepared for the Lord of Splendor.\" ***** Further on, the commentator introduces the following quotation: \"This rock andthis gate are the Son of God. 'How, Lord,' I said, 'is the rock old and the gatenew?' 'Listen,' He said, 'and understand, thou ignorant man. The Son of God isolder than all of his creation, so that he was a Councillor with the Father inHis works of creation; and for this is he old.' \" ****** Now, these two assertions are not only purely kabalistic, without even so muchas a change of expression, but Brahmanical and Pagan likewise. \"Vidi virumexcellentem coeli terraeque conditore natu majorem. . . . I have seen the mostexcellent (superior) MAN, who is older by birth than the maker of heaven andearth,\" says the kabalistic Codex. ******* The Eleusinian Dionysus, whoseparticular name was Iacchos (Iaccho, Iahoh) ********--the God from whom theliberation of souls was expected--was considered older than the Demiurge. At themysteries of the Anthesteria at the lakes (the Limnae), after the usual baptismby purification of water, the Mystae were made to pass through to another door(gate), and one particularly for that purpose, which was called \"the gate ofDionysus,\" and that of \"the purified.\" In the Sohar, the kabalists are told that the work-master, the Demiurge, said tothe Lord: \"Let us make man after our image.\" * In the original texts of thefirst chapter of Genesis, it stands: \"And the Elohim (translated as the SupremeGod), who are the highest gods or powers, said: Let us make man in our (?)image, after our likeness.\" In the Vedas, Brahma holds counsel with Parabrahma,as to the best mode to proceed to create the world. Canon Westcott, quoting Hermas, shows him asking: \"And why is the gate new,Lord? I said. 'Because,' he replied, 'he was manifested at the last of the daysof the dispensation; for this cause the gate was made new, in order that theywho shall be saved might enter by it into the Kingdom of God.' \" ** There aretwo peculiarities worthy of note in this passage. To begin with, it attributesto \"the Lord\" a false statement of the same character as that so emphasized bythe Apostle John, and which brought, at a later period, the whole of theorthodox Christians, who accepted the apostolic allegories as literal, to suchinconvenient straits. Jesus, as Messiah, was not manifested at the last of thedays; for the latter are yet to come, notwithstanding a number ofdivinely-inspired prophecies, followed by disappointed hopes, as a result, totestify to his immediate coming. The belief that the \"last times\" had come, wasnatural, when once the coming of King Messiah had been acknowledged. The secondpeculiarity is found in the fact that the prophecy could have been accepted atall, when even its approximate determination is a direct contradiction of Mark,who makes Jesus distinctly state that neither the angels, nor the Son himself,know of that day or that hour. *** We might add that, as the belief undeniablyoriginated with the Apocalypse, it ought to be a self-evident proof that itbelonged to the calculations peculiar to the kabalists and the Pagansanctuaries. It was the secret computation of a cycle, which, according to theirreckoning, was ending toward the latter part of the first century. It may alsobe held as a corroborative proof, that the Gospel according to Mark, as well asthat ascribed to John, and the Apocalypse, were written by men, of whom neitherwas sufficiently acquainted with the other. The Logos was first definitelycalled petra (rock) by Philo; the word, moreover, as we have shown elsewhere,means, in Chaldaic and Phoenician, \"interpreter.\" Justin Martyr calls him,throughout his works, \"angel,\" and makes a clear distinction between the Logosand God the Creator. \"The Word of God is His Son . . . and he is also called Angel and Apostle, forhe declares whatever we ought to know (interprets), and is sent to declarewhatever is disclosed.\" * \"Adan Inferior is distributed into its own paths, into thirty-two sides ofpaths, yet it is not known to any one but Seir. But no one knows the SUPERIORADAN nor His paths, except that Long Face\"--the Supreme God. ** Seir is theNazarene \"genius,\" who is called Æbel Zivo; and Gabriel Legatus--also \"ApostleGabriel.\" *** The Nazarenes held with the kabalists that even the Messiah whowas to come did not know the \"Superior Adan,\" the concealed Deity; no one exceptthe Supreme God; thus showing that above the Supreme Intelligible Deity, thereis one still more secret and unrevealed. Seir-Anpin is the third God, while\"Logos,\" according to Philo Judaeus, is the second one. **** This is distinctlyshown in the Codex. \"The false Messiah shall say: \"I am Deus, son of Deus; myFather sent me here. . . . I am the first Legate, I am Æbel Zivo, I am come fromon high! But distrust him; for he will not be Æbel Zivo. Æbel Zivo will notpermit himself to be seen in this age.\" ***** Hence the belief of some Gnosticsthat it was not Æbel Zivo (Archangel Gabriel) who \"overshadowed\" Mary, butIlda-Baoth, who formed the material body of Jesus; Christos uniting himself withhim only at the moment of baptism in the Jordan. Can we doubt Nork's assertion that \"the Bereshith Rabba, the oldest part of theMidrash Rabboth, was known to the Church Fathers in a Greek translation\"? ****** But if, on the one hand, they were sufficiently acquainted with the differentreligious systems of their neighbors to have enabled them to build a newreligion alleged to be distinct from all others, their ignorance of the OldTestament itself, let alone the more complicated questions of Grecianmetaphysics, is now found to have been deplorable. \"So, for instance, in Matthewxxvii. 9 f., the passage from Zechariah xi. 12, 13, is attributed to Jeremiah,\"says the author of Supernatural Religion. \"In Mark i. 2, a quotation fromMalachi iii. 1, is ascribed to Isaiah. In 1 Corinthians, ii. 9, a passage isquoted as Holy Scripture, which is not found in the Old Testament at all, butwhich is taken, as Origen and Jerome state, from an apocryphal work, TheRevelation of Elias (Origen: Tract. xxxv.), and the passage is similarly quotedby the so-called Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians (xxxiv.). How reliableare the pious Fathers in their explanations of divers heresies may beillustrated in the case of Epiphanius, who mistook the Pythagorean sacredTetrad, called in the Valentinian Gnosis, Kol-Arbas, for a heretic leader. *What with the involuntary blunders, and deliberate falsifications of theteachings of those who differed in views with them; the canonization of themythological Aura Placida (gentle breeze), into a pair of Christian martyrs--St.Aura and St. Placida; ** the deification of a spear and a cloak, under the namesof SS. Longimus and Amphibolus; ***and the Patristic quotations from prophets,of what was never in those prophets at all; one may well ask in blank amazementwhether the so-called religion of Christ has ever been other than an incoherentdream, since the death of the Great Master. So malicious do we find the holy Fathers in their unrelenting persecution ofpretended \"haeresies,\" **** that we see them telling, without hesitation themost preposterous untruths, and inventing entire narratives, the better toimpress their own otherwise unsupported arguments upon ignorance. If the mistakein relation to the tetrad had at first originated as a simple consequence of anunpremeditated blunder of Hippolytus, the explanations of Epiphanius and otherswho fell into the same absurd error ***** have a less innocent look. WhenHippolytus gravely denounces the great heresy of the Tetrad, Kol-Arbas, andstates that the imaginary Gnostic leader is, \"Kolarbasus, who endeavors toexplain religion by measures and numbers,\" * we may simply smile. But whenEpiphanius, with abundant indignation, elaborates upon the theme, \"which isHeresy XV.,\" and pretending to be thoroughly acquainted with the subject, adds:\"A certain Heracleon follows after Colarbasus, which is Heresy XVI.,\" ** then helays himself open to the charge of deliberate falsification. If this zealous Christian can boast so unblushingly of having caused \"by hisinformation seventy women, even of rank, to be sent into exile, through theseductions of some in whose number he had himself been drawn into joining theirsect,\" he has left us a fair standard by which to judge him. C. W. King remarks,very aptly, on this point, that \"it may reasonably be suspected that this worthyrenegade had in this case saved himself from the fate of his fellow-religionistsby turning evidence against them, on the opening of the persecution.\" *** And thus, one by one, perished the Gnostics, the only heirs to whose share hadfallen a few stray crumbs of the unadulterated truth of primitive Christianity.All was confusion and turmoil during these first centuries, till the moment whenall these contradictory dogmas were finally forced upon the Christian world, andexamination was forbidden. For long ages it was made a sacrilege, punishablewith severe penalties, often death, to seek to comprehend that which the Churchhad so conveniently elevated to the rank of divine mystery. But since biblicalcritics have taken upon themselves to \"set the house in order,\" the cases havebecome reversed. Pagan creditors now come from every part of the globe to claimtheir own, and Christian theology begins to be suspected of complete bankruptcy.Such is the sad result of the fanaticism of the \"orthodox\" sects, who, to borrowan expression of the author of \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" neverwere, like the Gnostics, \"the most polite, the most learned, and most wealthy ofthe Christian name.\" And, if not all of them \"smelt garlic,\" as Renan will haveit, on the other hand, none of these Christian saints have ever shrunk fromspilling their neighbor's blood, if the views of the latter did not agree withtheir own. And so all our philosophers were swept away by the ignorant and superstitiousmasses. The Philaletheians, the lovers of truth, and their eclectic school,perished; and there, where the young Hypatia had taught the highestphilosophical doctrines; and where Ammonius Saccas had explained that \"the wholewhich Christ had in view was to reinstate and restore to its primitive integritythe wisdom of the ancients--to reduce within bounds the universally prevailingdominion of superstition . . . and to exterminate the various errors that hadfound their way into the different popular religions\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu104.htm#fn_520]--there, we say, freelyraved the ὁι πολλοι of Christianity. No more precepts from the mouth of the\"God-taught philosopher,\" but others expounded by the incarnation of a mostcruel, fiendish superstition. \"If thy father,\" wrote St. Jerome, \"lies down across thy threshold, if thymother uncovers to thine eyes the bosom which suckled thee, trample on thyfather's lifeless body, trample on thy mother's bosom, and, with eyesunmoistened and dry, fly to the Lord who calleth thee\"! ! This sentence is equalled, if not outrivalled, by this other, pronounced in alike spirit. It emanates from another father of the early Church, the eloquentTertullian, who hopes to see all the \"philosophers\" in the gehenna fire of Hell.\"What shall be the magnitude of that scene! . . . How shall I laugh! How shall Irejoice! How shall I triumph when I see so many illustrious kings who were saidto have mounted into heaven, groaning with Jupiter, their god, in the lowestdarkness of hell! Then shall the soldiers who have persecuted the name of Christburn in more cruel fire than any they had kindled for the saints!\" ** These murderous expressions illustrate the spirit of Christianity till this day.But do they illustrate the teachings of Christ? By no means. As Eliphas Levisays, \"The God in the name of whom we would trample on our mother's bosom wemust see in the hereafter, a hell gaping widely at his feet, and anexterminating sword in his hand. . . . Moloch burned children but a few seconds;it was reserved to the disciples of a god who is alleged to have died to redeemhumanity on the cross, to create a new Moloch whose burning stake iseternal!\" *** That this spirit of true Christian love has safely crossed nineteen centuriesand rages now in America, is fully instanced in the case of the rabid Moody, therevivalist, who exclaims: \"I have a son, and no one but God knows how I lovehim; but I would see those beautiful eyes dug out of his head to-night, ratherthan see him grow up to manhood and go down to the grave without Christ andwithout hope!!\" To this an American paper, of Chicago, very justly responds: \"This is the spiritof the inquisition, which we are told is dead. If Moody in his zeal would 'digout' the eyes of his darling son, to what lengths may he not go with the sons ofothers, whom he may love less? It is the spirit of Loyola, gibbering in thenineteenth century, and prevented from lighting the fagot flame and heatingred-hot the instruments of torture only by the arm of law.\" [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES212:* \"Kabbala Denudata\"; preface to the \"Sohar,\" ii., p. 242. 212:** See Champollion's \"Egypte.\" 212:*** \"Idra Rabba,\" vi., p. 58. 213:* Idra Suta: \"Sohar,\" ii. 214:* Idra Suta: \"Sohar,\" iii., p. 288 a. 214:** Ego sum qui sum (see \"Bible\"). 214:*** See \"Institutes of Manu,\" translated by Sir William Jones. 214:**** Champollion. 214:***** We are fully aware that some Christian kabalists term En-Soph the\"Crown,\" p. 215 identify him with Sephira; call En-Soph \"an emanation from God,\"and make the ten Sephiroth comprise \"En-Soph\" as a unity. They also veryerroneously reverse the first two emanations of Sephira--Chochma and Binah. Thegreatest kabalists have always held Chochma (Wisdom) as a male and activeintelligence, Jah [images/00043.jpg], and placed it under the No. 2 on the rightside of the triangle, whose apex is the crown, while Binah (Intelligence) or[images/00039.jpg], is under No. 3 on the left hand. But the latter, beingrepresented by its divine name as Jehovah [images/00024.jpg], very naturallyshowed the God of Israel as only a third emanation, as well as a feminine,passive principle. Hence when the time came for the Talmudists to transformtheir multifarious deities into one living God, they resorted to their Masoreticpoints and combined to transform Jehovah into Adonai, \"the Lord.\" This, underthe persecution of the Mediaeval kabalists by the Church, also forced some ofthe former to change their female Sephiroth into male, and vice versa, so as toavoid being accused of disrespect and blasphemy to Jehovah; whose name,moreover, by mutual and secret agreement they accepted as a substitute for Jah,or the mystery name IAO. Alone the initiated knew of it, but later it gave riseto a great confusion among the uninitiated. It would be worth while--were it notfor lack of space--to quote a few of the many passages in the oldest Jewishauthorities, such as Rabbi Akiba, and the \"Sohar,\" which corroborate ourassertion. Chochma-Wisdom is a male principle everywhere, and Binah-Jehovah, afemale potency. The writings of Irenaeus, Theodoret, and Epiphanius, teemingwith accusations against the Gnostics and \"Haeresies,\" repeatedly show SimonMagus and Cerinthus making of Binah the feminine divine Spirit which inspiredSimon. Binah is Sophia, and the Sophia of the Gnostics is surely not a malepotency, but simply the feminine Wisdom, or Intelligence. (See any ancient\"Arbor Kabbalistica,\" or Tree of the Sephiroth.) Eliphas Levi, in the \"Rituel dela Haute Magie,\" vol. i., pp. 223 and 231, places Chochma as No. 2 and as a maleSephiroth on the right hand of the Tree. In the \"Kabala\" the three maleSephiroth--Chochma, Chesed, Netsah--are known as the Pillar of Mercy; and thethree feminine on the left, namely, Binah, Geburah, Hod, are named the Pillar ofJudgment; while the four Sephiroth of the centre--Kether, Tiphereth, Jesod, andMalchuth--are called the Middle Pillar. And, as Mackenzie, in the \"Royal MasonicCyclopaedia,\" shows, \"there is an analogy in these three pillars to the threePillars of Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty in a Craft Lodge of Masonry, while theEn-Soph forms the mysterious blazing star, or mystic light of the East\" (p.407). 216:* Justin: \"Cum.

Unable toagree as to which were the most divinely-inspired of the numerous gospels extantin its time, the mysterious Council of Nicea concluded to leave the decision ofthe puzzling question to miraculous intervention. This Nicean Council may wellbe called mysterious. There was a mystery, first, in the mystical number of its318 bishops, on which Barnabas (viii. 11, 12, 13) lays such a stress; added tothis, there is no agreement among ancient writers as to the time and place ofits assembly, nor even as to the bishop who presided. Notwithstanding thegrandiloquent eulogium of Constantine, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu105.htm#fn_523] Sabinus, the Bishop ofHeraclea, affirms that \"except Constantine, the emperor, and Eusebius Pamphilus,these bishops were a set of illiterate, simple creatures, that understoodnothing\"; which is equivalent to saying that they were a set of fools. Such wasapparently the opinion entertained of them by Pappus, who tells us of the bit ofmagic resorted to to decide which were the true gospels. In his Synodicon tothat Council Pappus says, having \"promiscuously put all the books that werereferred to the Council for determination under a communion-table in a church,they (the bishops) besought the Lord that the inspired writings might get uponthe table, while the spurious ones remained underneath, and it happenedaccordingly.\" But we are not told who kept the keys of the council chamber overnight! On the authority of ecclesiastical eye-witnesses, therefore, we are at libertyto say that the Christian world owes its \"Word of God\" to a method ofdivination, for resorting to which the Church subsequently condemned unfortunatevictims as conjurers, enchanters, magicians, witches, and vaticinators, andburnt them by thousands! In treating of this truly divine phenomenon of theself-sorting manuscripts, the Fathers of the Church say that God himselfpresides over the Sortes. As we have shown elsewhere, Augustine confesses thathe himself used this sort of divination. But opinions, like revealed religions,are liable to change. That which for nearly fifteen hundred years was imposed onChristendom as a book, of which every word was written under the directsupervision of the Holy Ghost; of which not a syllable, nor a comma could bechanged without sacrilege, is now being retranslated, revised, corrected, andclipped of whole verses, in some cases of entire chapters. And yet, as soon asthe new edition is out, its doctors would have us accept it as a new\"Revelation\" of the nineteenth century, with the alternative of being held as aninfidel. Thus, we see that, no more within than without its precincts, is theinfallible Church to be trusted more than would be reasonably convenient. Theforefathers of our modern divines found authority for the Sortes in the versewhere it is said: \"The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereofis of the Lord\"; * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu105.htm#fn_524] andnow, their direct heirs hold that \"the whole disposing thereof is of the Devil.\"Perhaps, they are unconsciously beginning to endorse the doctrine of the SyrianBardesanes, that the actions of God, as well as of man, are subject tonecessity? It was no doubt, also, according to strict \"necessity\" that the Neoplatonistswere so summarily dealt with by the Christian mob. In those days, the doctrinesof the Hindu naturalists and antediluvian Pyrrhonists were forgotten, if theyever had been known at all, to any but a few philosophers; and Mr. Darwin, withhis modern discoveries, had not even been mentioned in the prophesies. In thiscase the law of the survival of the fittest was reversed; the Neo-platonistswere doomed to destruction from the day when they openly sided with Aristotle. At the beginning of the fourth century crowds began gathering at the door of theacademy where the learned and unfortunate Hypatia expounded the doctrines of thedivine Plato and Plotinus, and thereby impeded the progress of Christianproselytism. She too successfully dispelled the mist hanging over the religious\"mysteries\" invented by the Fathers, not to be considered dangerous. This alonewould have been sufficient to imperil both herself and her followers. It wasprecisely the teachings of this Pagan philosopher, which had been so freelyborrowed by the Christians to give a finishing touch to their otherwiseincomprehensible scheme, that had seduced so many into joining the new religion;and now the Platonic light began shining so inconveniently bright upon the piouspatchwork, as to allow every one to see whence the \"revealed\" doctrines werederived. But there was a still greater peril. Hypatia had studied underPlutarch, the head of the Athenian school, and had learned all the secrets oftheurgy. While she lived to instruct the multitude, no divine miracles could beproduced before one who could divulge the natural causes by which they tookplace. Her doom was sealed by Cyril, whose eloquence she eclipsed, and whoseauthority, built on degrading superstitions, had to yield before hers, which waserected on the rock of immutable natural law. It is more than curious that Cave,the author of the Lives of the Fathers, should find it incredible that Cyrilsanctioned her murder on account of his \"general character.\" A saint who willsell the gold and silver vessels of his church, and then, after spending themoney, lie at his trial, as he did, may well be suspected of anything. Besides,in this case, the Church had to fight for her life, to say nothing of her futuresupremacy. Alone, the hated and erudite Pagan scholars, and the no less learnedGnostics, held in their doctrines the hitherto concealed wires of all thesetheological marionettes. Once the curtain should be lifted, the connectionbetween the old Pagan and the new Christian religions would be exposed; andthen, what would have become of the Mysteries into which it is sin and blasphemyto pry? With such a coincidence of the astronomical allegories of various Paganmyths with the dates adopted by Christianity for the nativity, crucifixion, andresurrection, and such an identity of rites and ceremonies, what would have beenthe fate of the new religion, had not the Church, under the pretext of servingChrist, got rid of the too-well-informed philosophers? To guess what, if thecoup d'etat had then failed, might have been the prevailing religion in our owncentury would indeed, be a hard task. But, in all probability, the state ofthings which made of the middle ages a period of intellectual darkness, whichdegraded the nations of the Occident, and lowered the European of those daysalmost to the level of a Papuan savage--could not have occurred. The fears of the Christians were but too well founded, and their pious zeal andprophetic insight was rewarded from the very first. In the demolition of theSerapeum, after the bloody riot between the Christian mob and the Paganworshippers had ended with the interference of the emperor, a Latin cross, of aperfect Christian shape, was discovered hewn upon the granite slabs of theadytum. This was a lucky discovery, indeed; and the monks did not fail to claimthat the cross had been hallowed by the Pagans in a \"spirit of prophecy.\" Atleast, Sozomen, with an air of triumph, records the fact. * But, archeology andsymbolism, those tireless and implacable enemies of clerical false pretences,have found in the hieroglyphics of the legend running around the design, atleast a partial interpretation of its meaning. According to King and other numismatists and archaeologists, the cross wasplaced there as the symbol of eternal life. Such a Tau, or Egyptian cross, wasused in the Bacchic and Eleusinian Mysteries. Symbol of the dual generativepower, it was laid upon the breast of the initiate, after his \"new birth\" wasaccomplished, and the Mystae had returned from their baptism in the sea. It wasa mystic sign that his spiritual birth had regenerated and united his astralsoul with his divine spirit, and that he was ready to ascend in spirit to theblessed abodes of light and glory--the Eleusinia. The Tau was a magic talismanat the same time as a religious emblem. It was adopted by the Christians throughthe Gnostics and kabalists, who used it largely, as their numerous gems testify,and who had the Tau (or handled cross) from the Egyptians, and the Latin crossfrom the Buddhist missionaries, who brought it from India, where it can be founduntil now, two or three centuries B.C. The Assyrians, Egyptians, ancientAmericans, Hindus, and Romans had it in various, but very slight modificationsof shape. Till very late in the mediaeval ages, it was considered a potent spellagainst epilepsy and demoniacal possession; and the \"signet of the living God,\"brought down in St. John's vision by the angel ascending from the east to \"sealthe servants of our God in their foreheads,\" was but the same mystic Tau--theEgyptian cross. In the painted glass of St. Dionysus (France), this angel isrepresented as stamping this sign on the forehead of the elect; the legendreads, SIGNVM TAY. In King's Gnostics, the author reminds us that \"this mark iscommonly borne by St. Anthony, an Egyptian recluse.\" ** What the real meaning ofthe Tau was, is explained to us by the Christian St. John, the Egyptian Hermes,and the Hindu Brahmans. It is but too evident that, with the apostle, at least,it meant the \"Ineffable Name,\" as he calls this \"signet of the living God,\" afew chapters further on, *** the \"Father's name written in their foreheads.\" The Brahmatma, the chief of the Hindu initiates, had on his headgear two keys,symbol of the revealed mystery of life and death, placed cross-like; and, insome Buddhist pagodas of Tartary and Mongolia, the entrance of a chamber withinthe temple, generally containing the staircase which leads to the innerdaghoba, * and the porticos of some Prachida ** are ornamented with a crossformed of two fishes, and as found on some of the zodiacs of the Buddhists. Weshould not wonder at all at learning that the sacred device in the tombs in theCatacombs, at Rome, the \"Vesica piscis,\" was derived from the said Buddhistzodiacal sign. How general must have been that geometrical figure in theworld-symbols, may be inferred from the fact that there is a Masonic traditionthat Solomon's temple was built on three foundations, forming the \"triple Tau,\"or three crosses. In its mystical sense, the Egyptian cross owes its origin, as an emblem, to therealization by the earliest philosophy of an androgynous dualism of everymanifestation in nature, which proceeds from the abstract ideal of a likewiseandrogynous deity, while the Christian emblem is simply due to chance. Had theMosaic law prevailed, Jesus should have been lapidated. *** The crucifix was aninstrument of torture, and utterly common among Romans as it was unknown amongSemitic nations. It was called the \"Tree of Infamy.\" It is but later that it wasadopted as a Christian symbol; but, during the first two decades, the apostleslooked upon it with horror. *** It is certainly not the Christian Cross thatJohn had in mind when speaking of the \"signet of the living God,\" but the mysticTau--the Tetragrammaton, or mighty name, which, on the most ancient kabalistictalismans, was represented by the four Hebrew letters composing the Holy Word. The famous Lady Ellenborough, known among the Arabs of Damascus, and in thedesert, after her last marriage, as Hanoum Medjouye, had a talisman in herpossession, presented to her by a Druze from Mount Lebanon. It was recognized bya certain sign on its left corner, to belong to that class of gems which isknown in Palestine as a \"Messianic\" amulet, of the second or third century, B.C. It is a green stone of a pentagonal form; at the bottom is engraved a fish;higher, Solomon's seal; ***** and still higher, the four Chaldaic letters--Jod,He, Vau, He, IAHO, which form the name of the Deity. These are arranged in quitean unusual way, running from below upward, in reversed order, and forming theEgyptian Tau. Around these there is a legend which, as the gem is not ourproperty, we are not at liberty to give. The Tau, in its mystical sense, as wellas the crux ansata, is the Tree of Life. It is well known, that the earliest Christian emblems--before it was everattempted to represent the bodily appearance of Jesus--were the Lamb, the GoodShepherd, and the Fish. The origin of the latter emblem, which has so puzzledthe archaeologists, thus becomes comprehensible. The whole secret lies in theeasily-ascertained fact that, while in the Kabala, the King Messiah is called\"Interpreter,\" or Revealer of the mystery, and shown to be the fifth emanation,in the Talmud--for reasons we will now explain--the Messiah is very oftendesignated as \"DAG,\" or the Fish. This is an inheritance from the Chaldees, andrelates--as the very name indicates--to the Babylonian Dagon, the man-fish, whowas the instructor and interpreter of the people, to whom he appeared. Abarbanelexplains the name, by stating that the sign of his (Messiah's) coming \"is theconjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the sign Pisces.\" *Therefore, as theChristians were intent upon identifying their Christos with the Messiah of theOld Testament, they adopted it so readily as to forget that its true originmight be traced still farther back than the Babylonian Dagon. How eagerly andclosely the ideal of Jesus was united, by the early Christians, with everyimaginable kabalistic and Pagan tenet, may be inferred from the language ofClemens, of Alexandria, addressed to his brother co-religionists. [images/00056.jpg] When they were debating upon the choice of the most appropriate symbol to remindthem of Jesus, Clemens advised them in the following words: \"Let the engravingupon the gem of your ring be either a dove, or a ship running before the wind(the Argha), or a fish.\" Was the good father, when writing this sentence,laboring under the recollection of Joshua, son of Nun (called Jesus in the Greekand Slavonian versions); or had he forgotten the real interpretation of thesePagan symbols? Joshua, son of Nun, or Nave (Navis), could have with perfect propriety adoptedthe image of a ship, or even of a fish, for Joshua means Jesus, son of thefish-god; but it was really too hazardous to connect the emblems of Venus,Astarte, and all the Hindu goddesses--the argha, dove, and fish--with the\"immaculate\" birth of their god! This looks very much as if in the early days ofChristianity but little difference was made between Christ, Bacchus, Apollo, andthe Hindu Christna, the incarnation of Vishnu, with whose first avatar thissymbol of the fish originated. In the Hari-purana, in the Bagaved-gitta, as well as in several other books, thegod Vishnu is shown as having assumed the form of a fish with a human head, inorder to reclaim the Vedas lost during the deluge. Having enabled Visvamitra toescape with all his tribe in the ark, Vishnu, pitying weak and ignoranthumanity, remained with them for some time. It was this god who taught them tobuild houses, cultivate the land, and to thank the unknown Deity whom herepresented, by building temples and instituting a regular worship; and, as heremained half-fish, half-man, all the time, at every sunset he used to return tothe ocean, wherein he passed the night. \"It is he,\" says the sacred book, \"who taught men, after the diluvium, all thatwas necessary for their happiness. \"One day he plunged into the water and returned no more, for the earth hadcovered itself again with vegetation, fruit, and cattle. \"But he had taught the Brahmas the secret of all things\" (Hari-purana). So far, we see in this narrative the double of the story given by the BabylonianBerosus about Oannes, the fish-man, who is no other than Vishnu--unless, indeed,we have to believe that it was Chaldea which civilized India! We say again, we desire to give nothing on our sole authority. Therefore we citeJacolliot, who, however criticised and contradicted on other points, and howeverloose he may be in the matter of chronology (though even in this he is nearerright than those scientists who would have all Hindu books written since theCouncil of Nicea), at least cannot be denied the reputation of a good Sanscritscholar. And he says, while analyzing the word Oan, or Oannes, that O inSanscrit is an interjection expressing an invocation, as O, Swayambhuva! O, God!etc.; and An is a radical, signifying in Sanscrit a spirit, a being; and, wepresume, what the Greeks meant by the word Daemon, a semi-god. \"What an extraordinary antiquity,\" he remarks, \"this fable of Vishnu, disguisedas a fish, gives to the sacred books of the Hindus; especially in presence ofthe fact that the Vedas and Manu reckon more than twenty-five thousand years ofexistence, as proved by the most serious as the most authentic documents. Fewpeoples, says the learned Halled, have their annals more authentic or seriousthan the Hindus.\" * We may, perhaps, throw additional light upon the puzzling question of thefish-symbol by reminding the reader that according to Genesis the first createdof living beings, the first type of animal life, was the fish. \"And the Elohimsaid: 'Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life'. . . and God created great whales . . . and the morning and the evening werethe fifth day.\" Jonah is swallowed by a big fish, and is cast out again threedays later. This the Christians regard as a premonition of the three days'sepulture of Jesus which preceded his resurrection--though the statement of thethree days is as fanciful as much of the rest, and adopted to fit the well-knownthreat to destroy the temple and rebuild it again in three days. Between hisburial and alleged resurrection there intervened but one day--the JewishSabbath--as he was buried on Friday evening and rose to life at dawn on Sunday.However, whatever other circumstance may be regarded as a prophecy, the story ofJonah cannot be made to answer the purpose. \"Big Fish\" is Cetus, the latinized form of Keto--Κετος and keto is Dagon,Poseidon, the female gender of it being Keton Atar-gatis--the Syrian goddess,and Venus, of Askalon. The figure or bust of Der-Keto or Astarte was generallyrepresented on the prow of the ships. Jonah (the Greek Iona, or dove sacred toVenus) fled to Jaffa, where the god Dagon, the man-fish, was worshipped, anddared not go to Nineveh, where the dove was revered. Hence, some commentatorsbelieve that when Jonah was thrown overboard and was swallowed by a fish, wemust understand that he was picked up by one of these vessels, on the prow ofwhich was the figure of Keto. But the kabalists have another legend, to thiseffect: They say that Jonah was a run-away priest from the temple of the goddesswhere the dove was worshipped, and desired to abolish idolatry and institutemonotheistic worship. That, caught near Jaffa, he was held prisoner by thedevotees of Dagon in one of the prison-cells of the temple, and that it is thestrange form of the cell which gave rise to the allegory. In the collection ofMose de Garcia, a Portuguese kabalist, there is a drawing representing theinterior of the temple of Dagon. In the middle stands an immense idol, the upperportion of whose body is human, and the lower fish-like. Between the belly andthe tail is an aperture which can be closed like the door of a closet. In it thetransgressors against the local deity were shut up until further disposal. Thedrawing in question was made from an old tablet covered with curious drawingsand inscriptions in old Phoenician characters, describing this Venetianoubliette of biblical days. The tablet itself was found in an excavation a fewmiles from Jaffa. Considering the extraordinary tendency of Oriental nations forpuns and allegories, is it not barely possible that the \"big fish\" by whichJonah was swallowed was simply the cell within the belly of Dagon? It is significant that this double appellation of \"Messiah\" and \"Dag\" (fish), ofthe Talmudists, should so well apply to the Hindu Vishnu, the \"Preserving\"Spirit, and the second personage of the Brahmanic trinity. This deity, havingalready manifested itself, is still regarded as the future Saviour of humanity,and is the selected Redeemer, who will appear at its tenth incarnation oravatar, like the Messiah of the Jews, to lead the blessed onward, and restore tothem the primitive Vedas. At his first avatar, Vishnu is alleged to haveappeared to humanity, in form like a fish. In the temple of Rama, there is arepresentation of this god which answers perfectly to that of Dagon, as given byBerosus. He has the body of a man issuing from the mouth of a fish, and holds inhis hands the lost Veda. Vishnu, moreover, is the water-god, in one sense, theLogos of the Parabrahm, for as the three persons of the manifested god-headconstantly interchange their attributes, we see him in the same templerepresented as reclining on the seven-headed serpent, Ananta (eternity), andmoving, like the Spirit of God, on the face of the primeval waters. Vishnu is evidently the Adam Kadmon of the kabalists, for Adam is the Logos orthe first Anointed, as Adam Second is the King Messiah. Lakmy, or Lakshmi, the passive or feminine counterpart of Vishnu, the creatorand the preserver, is also called Ada Maya. She is the \"Mother of the World,\"Damatri, the Venus Aphrodite of the Greeks: also Isis and Eve. While Venus isborn from the sea-foam, Lakmy springs out from the water at the churning of thesea; when born, she is so beautiful that all the gods fall in love with her. TheJews, borrowing their types wherever they could get them, made their first womanafter the pattern of Lakmy. It is curious that Viracocha, the Supreme Being inPeru, means, literally translated, \"foam of the sea.\" Eugene Burnouf, the great authority of the French school, announces his opinionin the same spirit: \"We must learn one day,\" he observes, \"that all ancienttraditions disfigured by emigration and legend, belong to the history of India.\"Such is the opinion of Colebrooke, Inman, King, Jacolliot, and many otherOrientalists. We have said above, that, according to the secret computation peculiar to thestudents of the hidden science, Messiah is the fifth emanation, or potency. Inthe Jewish Kabala, where the ten Sephiroth emanate from Adam Kadmon (placedbelow the crown), he comes fifth. So in the Gnostic system; so in theBuddhistic, in which the fifth Buddha--Maitree, will appear at his last adventto save mankind before the final destruction of the world. If Vishnu isrepresented in his forthcoming and last appearance as the tenth avatar orincarnation, it is only because every unit held as an androgyne manifests itselfdoubly. The Buddhists who reject this dual-sexed incarnation reckon but five.Thus, while Vishnu is to make his last appearance in his tenth, Buddha is saidto do the same in his fifth incarnation. * The better to illustrate the idea, and show how completely the real meaning ofthe avatars, known only to the students of the secret doctrine was misunderstoodby the ignorant masses, we elsewhere give the diagrams of the Hindu andChaldeo-Kabalistic avatars and emanations. ** This basic and true fundamentalstone of the secret cycles, shows on its very face, that far from taking theirrevealed Vedas and Bible literally, the Brahman-pundits, and the Tanaim--thescientists and philosophers of the pre-Christian epochs--speculated on thecreation and development of the world quite in a Darwinian way, bothanticipating him and his school in the natural selection of species, gradualdevelopment, and transformation. We advise every one tempted to enter an indignant protest against thisaffirmation to read more carefully the books of Manu, even in the incompletetranslation of Sir William Jones, and the more or less careless one ofJacolliot. If we compare the Sanchoniathon Phoenician Cosmogony, and the recordof Berosus with the Bhagavatta and Manu, we will find enunciated exactly thesame principles as those now offered as the latest developments of modernscience. We have quoted from the Chaldean and Phoenician records in our firstvolume; we will now glance at the Hindu books. \"When this world had issued out of darkness, the subtile elementary principlesproduced the vegetal seed which animated first the plants; from the plants, lifepassed into fantastical bodies which were born in the ilus of the waters; then,through a series of forms and various animals, it reached MAN.\" *** \"He (man, before becoming such) will pass successively through plants, worms,insects, fish, serpents, tortoises, cattle, and wild animals; such is theinferior degree.\" \"Such, from Brahma down to the vegetables, are declared the transmigrationswhich take place in this world.\" **** In the Sanchoniathonian Cosmogony, men are also evolved out of the ilus of thechaos, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu105.htm#fn_539] and the sameevolution and transformation of species are shown. And now we will leave the rostrum to Mr. Darwin: \"I believe that animals havedescended from at most only four or five progenitors.\" ** Again: \"I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings whichhave ever lived on this earth, have descended from some one primordialform. ***. . . I view all beings, not as special creations, but as the linealdescendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of theSilurian system was deposited.\" **** In short, they lived in the Sanchoniathonian chaos, and in the ilus of Manu.Vyasa and Kapila go still farther than Darwin and Manu. \"They see in Brahma butthe name of the universal germ; they deny the existence of a First Cause; andpretend that everything in nature found itself developed only in consequence ofmaterial and fatal forces,\" says Jacolliot. ***** Correct as may be this latter quotation from Kapila, it demands a few words ofexplanation. Jacolliot repeatedly compares Kapila and Veda Vyasa with Pyrrho andLittre. We have nothing against such a comparison with the Greek philosopher,but we must decidedly object to any with the French Comtist; we find it anunmerited fling at the memory of the great Aryan sage. Nowhere does thisprolific writer state the repudiation by either ancient or modern Brahmans ofGod--the \"unknown,\" universal Spirit; nor does any other Orientalist accuse theHindus of the same, however perverted the general deductions of our savantsabout Buddhistic atheism. On the contrary, Jacolliot states more than once thatthe learned Pundits and educated Brahmans have never shared the popularsuperstitions; and affirms their unshaken belief in the unity of God and thesoul's immortality, although most assuredly neither Kapila, nor the initiatedBrahmans, nor the followers of the Vedanta school would ever admit the existenceof an anthropomorphic creator, a \"First Cause\" in the Christian sense.Jacolliot, in his Indo-European and African Traditions, is the first to make anonslaught on Professor Muller, for remarking that the Hindu gods were \"maskswithout actors . . . names without being, and not beings without names.\" ******Quoting, in support of his argument, numerous verses from the sacred Hindubooks, he adds: \"Is it possible to refuse to the author of these stanzas adefinite and clear conception of the divine force, of the Unique Being, masterand Sovereign of the Universe? . . . Were the altars then built to ametaphor?\" * The latter argument is perfectly just, so far as Max Muller's negation isconcerned. But we doubt whether the French rationalist understands Kapila's andVyasa's philosophy better than the German philologist does the \"theologicaltwaddle,\" as the latter terms the Atharva-Veda. Professor Muller and Jacolliotmay have ever so great claims to erudition, and be ever so familiar withSanscrit and other ancient Oriental languages, but both lack the key to thethousand and one mysteries of the old secret doctrine and its philosophy. Only,while the German philologist does not even take the trouble to look into thismagical and \"theological twaddle,\" we find the French Indianis never losing anopportunity to investigate. Moreover, he honestly admits his incompetency toever fathom this ocean of mystical learning. In its existence he not only firmlybelieves, but throughout his works he incessantly calls the attention of scienceto its unmistakable traces at every step in India. Still, though the learnedPundits and Brahmans--his \"revered masters\" of the pagodas of Villenoor andChelambrum in the Carnatic, ** as it seems, positively refused to reveal to himthe mysteries of the magical part of the Agrouchada-Parikshai, *** and ofBrahmatma's triangle, **** he persists in the honest declaration that everythingis possible in Hindu metaphysics, even to the Kapila and Vyasa systems havingbeen hitherto misunderstood. M. Jacolliot weakens his assertion immediately afterward with the followingcontradiction: \"We were one day inquiring of a Brahman of the pagoda of Chelambrum, whobelonged to the skeptical school of the naturalists of Vyasa, whether hebelieved in the existence of God. He answered us, smiling: 'Aham eva paramBrahma'--I am myself a god. \" 'What do you mean by that?' \" 'I mean that every being on earth, however humble, is an immortal portion ofthe immortal matter.' \" ***** The answer is one which would suggest itself to every ancient philosopher,Kabalist and Gnostic, of the early days. It contains the very spirit of thedelphic and kabalistic commandment, for esoteric philosophy solved, ages ago,the problem of what man was, is, and will be. If persons believing the Bibleverse which teaches that the \"Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, andbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life,\" reject at the same time the ideathat every atom of this dust, as every particle of this \"living soul,\" contains\"God\" within itself, then we pity the logic of that Christian. He forgets theverses which precede the one in question. God blesses equally every beast of thefield and every living creature, in the water as in the air, and He endows themall with life, which is a breath of His own Spirit, and the soul of the animal.Humanity is the Adam Kadmon of the \"Unknown,\" His microcosm, and His onlyrepresentative on earth, and every man is a god on earth. We would ask this French scholar, who seems so familiar with every sloka of thebooks of Manu, and other Vedic writers, the meaning of this sentence so wellknown to him: \"Plants and vegetation reveal a multitude of forms because of their precedentactions; they are surrounded by darkness, but are nevertheless endowed with aninterior soul, and feel equally pleasure and pain\" (Manu, book i.). If the Hindu philosophy teach the presence of a degree of soul in the lowestforms of vegetable life, and even in every atom in space, how is it possiblethat it should deny the same immortal principle to man? And if it once admit theimmortal spirit in man, how can it logically deny the existence of the parentsource--I will not say the first, but the eternal Cause? Neither rationalistsnor sensualists, who do not comprehend Indian metaphysics, should estimate theignorance of Hindu metaphysicians by their own. The grand cycle, as we have heretofore remarked, includes the progress ofmankind from its germ in the primordial man of spiritual form to the deepestdepth of degradation he can reach--each successive step in the descent beingaccompanied by a greater strength and grossness of the physical form than itsprecursor--and ends with the Flood. But while the grand cycle, or age, isrunning its course, seven minor cycles are passed, each marking the evolution ofa new race out of the preceding one, on a new world. And each of these races, orgrand types of humanity, breaks up into subdivisions of families, and they againinto nations and tribes, as we see the earth's inhabitants subdivided to-dayinto Mongols, Caucasians, Indians, etc. Before proceeding to show by diagrams the close resemblance between the esotericphilosophies of all the ancient peoples, however geographically remote from eachother, it will be useful to briefly explain the real ideas which underlie allthose symbols and allegorical representations and have hitherto so puzzled theuninitiated commentators. Better than anything, it may show that religion andscience were closer knit than twins in days of old; that they were one in twoand two in one from the very moment of their conception. With mutuallyconvertible attributes, science was spiritual and religion was scientific. Likethe androgyne man of the first chapter of Genesis--\"male and female,\" passiveand active; created in the image of the Elohim. Omniscience developedomnipotency, the latter called for the exercise of the former, and thus thegiant had dominion given him over all the four kingdoms of the world. But, likethe second Adam, these androgynes were doomed to \"fall and lose their powers\" assoon as the two halves of the duality separated. The fruit of the Tree ofKnowledge gives death without the fruit of the Tree of Life. Man must knowhimself before he can hope to know the ultimate genesis even of beings andpowers less developed in their inner nature than himself. So with religion andscience; united two in one they were infallible, for the spiritual intuition wasthere to supply the limitations of physical senses. Separated, exact sciencerejects the help of the inner voice, while religion becomes merely dogmatictheology--each is but a corpse without a soul. The esoteric doctrine, then, teaches, like Buddhism and Brahmanism, and even thepersecuted Kabala, that the one infinite and unknown Essence exist from alleternity, and in regular and harmonious successions is either passive or active.In the poetical phraseology of Manu these conditions are called the \"day\" andthe \"night\" of Brahma. The latter is either \"awake\" or \"asleep.\" TheSvabhavikas, or philosophers of the oldest school of Buddhism (which stillexists in Nepaul), speculate but upon the active condition of this \"essence,\"which they call Svabhavat, and deem it foolish to theorize upon the abstract and\"unknowable\" power in its passive condition. Hence they are called atheists byboth Christian theology and modern scientists; for neither of the two are ableto understand the profound logic of their philosophy. The former will allow ofno other God than the personified secondary powers which have blindly worked outthe visible universe, and which became with them the anthropomorphic God of theChristians--the Jehovah, roaring amid thunder and lightning. In its turn,rationalistic science greets the Buddhists and the Svabhavikas as the\"positivists\" of the archaic ages. If we take a one-sided view of the philosophyof the latter, our materialists may be right in their own way. The Buddhistsmaintain that there is no Creator but an infinitude of creative powers, whichcollectively form the one eternal substance, the essence of which isinscrutable--hence not a subject for speculation for any true philosopher.Socrates invariably refused to argue upon the mystery of universal being, yet noone would ever have thought of charging him with atheism, except those who werebent upon his destruction. Upon inaugurating an active period, says the SecretDoctrine, an expansion of this Divine essence, from within outwardly, occurs inobedience to eternal and immutable law, and the phenomenal or visible universeis the ultimate result of the long chain of cosmical forces thus progressivelyset in motion. In like manner, when the passive condition is resumed, acontraction of the Divine essence takes place, and the previous work of creationis gradually and progressively undone. The visible universe becomesdisintegrated, its material dispersed; and \"darkness,\" solitary and alone,broods once more over the face of the \"deep.\" To use a metaphor which willconvey the idea still more clearly, an outbreathing of the \"unknown essence\"produces the world; and an inhalation causes it to disappear. This process hasbeen going on from all eternity, and our present universe is but one of aninfinite series which had no beginning and will have no end. Thus we are enabled to build our theories solely on the visible manifestationsof the Deity, on its objective natural phenomena. To apply to these creativeprinciples the term God is puerile and absurd. One might as well call by thename of Benvenuto Cellini the fire which fuses the metal, or the air that coolsit when it is run in the mould. If the inner and ever-concealed spiritual, andto our minds abstract, Essence within these forces can ever be connected withthe creation of the physical universe, it is but in the sense given to it byPlato. IT may be termed, at best, the framer of the abstract universe whichdeveloped gradually in the Divine Thought within which it had lain dormant. In Chapter VIII. we will attempt to show the esoteric meaning of Genesis, andits complete agreement with the ideas of other nations. The six days of creationwill be found to have a meaning little suspected by the multitude ofcommentators, who have exercised their abilities to the full extent inattempting to reconcile them by turns with Christian theology and un-Christiangeology. Disfigured as the Old Testament is, yet in its symbolism is preservedenough of the original in its principal features to show the family likeness tothe cosmogonies of older nations than the Jews. We here give the diagrams of the Hindu and the Chaldeo-Jewish cosmogonies. Theantiquity of the diagram of the former may be inferred from the fact that manyof the Brahmanical pagodas are designed and built on this figure, called the\"Sri-Iantara.\" * And yet we find the highest honors paid to it by the Jewish andmediaeval kabalists, who call it \"Solomon's seal.\" It will be quite an easymatter to trace it to its origin, once we are reminded of the history of theking-kabalist and his transaction with King Hiram and Ophir--the country ofpeacocks, gold, and ivory--for which land we have to search in old India."},{"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF THE TWO DIAGRAMS"},{"pageContent":"REPRESENTING THE CHAOTIC AND THE FORMATIVE PERIODS, BEFORE AND AFTER OURUNIVERSE BEGAN TO BE EVOLVED."},{"pageContent":"FROM THE ESOTERIC BRAHMANICAL, BUDDHISTIC, AND CHALDEAN STANDPOINTS, WHICH AGREEIN EVERY RESPECT WITH THE EVOLUTIONARY THEORY OF MODERN SCIENCE.

He will become the latter when the period ofcreation shall have compelled him to expand the Force within himself, accordingto the Law of which he is the embodiment and essence. \"Whosoever acquaints himself with the Mercaba and the lahgash (secret speech orincantation), * will learn the secret of secrets.\" Both \"THIS\" and En-Soph, in their first manifestation of Light, emerging fromwithin Darkness, may be summarized in the Svabhavat, the Eternal and theuncreated Self-existing Substance which produces all; while everything which isof its essence produces itself out of its own nature. The Space Around the Upper Triangle. When the \"Night of Brahma\" was ended, and the time came for the Self-Existent tomanifest Itself by revelation, it made its glory visible by sending forth fromits Essence an active Power, which, female at first, subsequently becomes The Space Around the Upper Triangle. When the active period had arrived, En-Soph sent forth from within his owneternal essence, Sephira, the active Power, called the Primordial Point, and theCrown, Keter. It is only through her that the \"Un-bounded Wisdom\" could androgyne. It is Aditi, the \"Infinite,\" *the Boundless, or rather the\"Unbounded.\" Aditi is the \"mother\" of all the gods, and Aditi is the Father andthe Son. **\"Who will give us back to the great Aditi, that I may see father andmother?\" *** It is in conjunction with the latter female, Force, that the Divinebut latent Thought produces the great \"Deep\"--water. \"Water is born from atransformation of light . . . and from a modification of the water is born theearth,\" says Manu (book i.). \"Ye are born of Aditi from the water, you who are born of the earth, hear ye allmy call.\" **** In this water (or primeval chaos) the \"Infinite\" androgyne, which, with theEternal Cause, forms the first abstract Triad, rendered by AUM, deposited thegerm of universal life. It is the Mundane Egg, in which took place the gestationof Purusha, or the manifested Brahma.

Two sides of the upper triangle,the right side and the base, are composed of unbroken lines; the third, the leftside, is dotted. It is through the latter that emerges Sephira. Spreading inevery direction, she finally encompasses the whole triangle. In this emanationof the female active principle from the left side of the mystic triangle, isforeshadowed the creation of Eve from Adam's left rib. Adam is the Microcosm ofthe Macrocosm, and is created in the image of the Elohim. In the Tree of Lifethe triple triad is disposed in such a manner that the three male Sephiroth areon the right, the three female on the left, and the four uniting principles inthe centre. From the Invisible Dew falling from the Higher \"Head\" Sephiracreates primeval water, or chaos taking shape. It is the first step toward thesolidification of Spirit, which through various modifications will produceearth. *b \"It requires earth and water to make a living soul,\" says Moses. When Sephira emerges like an active power from within the latent Deity, she is earth (both yet in their ideal, not their manifested form). Thus, this second triad, only another name for the first one (never pronouncedaloud), and which is the real pre-Vedic and primordial secret Trimurti,consisted of Nara, Father-Heaven,Nari, Mother-Earth,Viradj, the Son--or Universe. The Trimurti, comprising Brahma, the Creator, Vishnu, the Preserver, and Siva,the Destroyer and Regenerator, belongs to a later period. It is ananthropomorphic afterthought, invented for the more popular comprehension of theuninitiated masses. The Dikshita, the initiate, knew better. Thus, also, theprofound allegory under the colors of a ridiculous fable, given in the AytareyaBrahmana,*which resulted in the representations in some temples of Brahm-Nara,assuming the form of a bull, and his daughter, Aditi-Nari, that of a heifer,contains the same metaphysical idea as the \"fall of man,\" or that of the Spiritinto generation--matter. The All-pervading Divine Spirit embodied under thesymbols of Heaven, the Sun, and Heat (fire)--the correlation of cosmicforces--fecundates Matter or Nature, the daughter of Spirit. And Para-Brahmahimself has to submit to and bear the penance of the curses of the other gods(Elohim) for such an incest. (See corresponding column.) According to theimmutable, and, therefore, fatal law, both Nara and Nari are mutually Father andMother, as well as Father and Daughter. ** Matter, through infinitetransformation, is the gradual product of Spirit. The unification of one EternalSupreme Cause required such a correlation; and if nature be female; when she assumes the office of a creator, she becomes a male; hence, sheis androgyne. She is the \"Father and Mother Aditi,\" of the Hindu Cosmogony.After brooding over the \"Deep,\" the Spirit of God\" produces its own image in thewater, the Universal Womb, symbolized in Manu by the Golden Egg. In thekabalistic Cosmogony, Heaven and Earth are personified by Adam Kadmon and thesecond Adam. The first Ineffable Triad, contained in the abstract idea of the\"Three Heads,\" was a \"mystery name.\" It was composed of En-Soph, Sephira, andAdam Kadmon, the Protogonos, the latter being identical with the former, whenbisexual. *b. In every triad there is a male, a female, and an androgyne.Adam-Sephira is the Crown (Keter). It sets itself to the work of creation, byfirst producing Chochmah, Male Wisdom, a masculine active potency, representedby [images/00043.jpg], jah, or the Wheels of Creation, [images/00060.jpg], fromwhich proceeds Binah, Intelligence, female and passive potency, which isJehovah, [images/00024.jpg], whom we find in the Bible figuring as the Supreme.But this Jehovah is not the kabalistic Jodcheva. The binary is the fundamentalcorner-stone of Gnosis. As the binary is the Unity multiplying itself andself-creating, the kabalists show the \"Unknown\" passive En-Soph, as emanatingfrom himself, Sephira, which, becoming visible light, is said to produce AdamKadmon. But, in the hidden sense, Sephira and Adam are one and the same light,only latent and active, invisible and visible. The second Adam, as the humantetragram, produces in his turn Eve, out of his side. It is this second triad,with which the kabalists have hitherto dealt, hardly hinting at the Supreme andIneffable One, and never committing anything to writing. All knowledgeconcerning the latter was imparted orally. It is the second Adam, then, who isthe unity represented by Jod, emblem of the kabalistic male principle, and, atthe same time, he is Chochmah, Wisdom, while Binah or Jehovah is Eve; the first the product or effect of that Cause, in its turn it has to be fecundated by thesame divine Ray which produced nature itself. The most absurd cosmogonicalallegories, if analyzed without prejudice, will be found built on strict andlogical necessarianism. \"Being was born from not-being,\" says a verse in the Rig-Veda. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu105.htm#fn_563] The first being had tobecome androgyne and finite, by the very fact of its creation as a being. Andthus even the sacred Trimurti, containing Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva will have anend when the \"night\" of Para-Brahma succeeds the present \"day,\" or period ofuniversal activity. The second, or rather the first, triad--as the highest one is a pureabstraction--is the intellectual world. The Vach which surrounds it is a moredefinite transformation of Aditi. Besides its occult significance in the secretMantram, Vach is personified as the active power of Brahma proceeding from him.In the Vedas she is made to speak of herself as the supreme and universal soul.\"I bore the Father on the head of the universal mind, and my origin is in themidst of the ocean; and therefore do I pervade all beings. . . . Originating allbeings, I pass like the breeze (Holy Ghost). I am above this heaven, beyond thisearth; and what is the Great One that am I.\" ** Literally, Vach is speech, thepower of awakening, through the metrical arrangement contained in the number andsyllables of the Mantras, *** corresponding powers in the invisible world. Inthe sacrificial Mysteries Vach stirs up the Brahma (Brahma jinvati), or thepower lying latent at the bottom of every magical operation. It existed frometernity as the Yajna (its latent form), lying dormant in Brahma from\"no-beginning,\" and proceeded forth from him as Vach (the active power). It isthe key to the \"Trai vidya,\" Chochmah issuing from Keter, or the androgyne, Adam Kadmon, and the second,Binah, from Chochmah. If we combine with Jod the three letters which form thename of Eve, we will have the divine tetragram pronounced IEVO-HEVAH, Adam andEve, [images/00024.jpg], Jehovah, male and female, or the idealization ofhumanity embodied in the first man. Thus is it that we can prove that, while theJewish kabalists, in common with their initiated masters, the Chaldeans and theHindus, adored the Supreme and Unknown God, in the sacred silence of theirsanctuaries, the ignorant masses of every nation were left to adore somethingwhich was certainly less than the Eternal Substance of the Buddhists, theso-called Atheists. As Brahma, the deity manifested in the mythical Manu, or thefirst man (born of Swayambhuva, or the Self-existent), is finite, so Jehovah,embodied in Adam and Eve, is but a human god. He is the symbol of humanity, amixture of good with a portion of unavoidable evil; of spirit fallen intomatter. In worshipping Jehovah, we simply worship nature, as embodied in man,half-spiritual and half-material, at best: we are Pantheists, when not fetichworshippers, like the idolatrous Jews, who sacrificed on high places, in groves,to the personified male and female principle, ignorant of IAO, the Supreme\"Secret Name\" of the Mysteries. Shekinah is the Hindu Vach, and praised in the same terms as the latter. Thoughshown in the kabalistic Tree of Life as proceeding from the ninth Sephiroth, yetShekinah is the \"veil\" of En-Soph, and the \"garment\" of Jehovah. The \"veil,\" forit succeeded for long ages in concealing the real supreme God, the universalSpirit, and masking Jehovah, the exoteric deity, made the Christians accept himas the \"father\" of the initiated Jesus. Yet the kabalists, as well as the HinduDikshita, know the power of the Shekinah or Vach, and call it the \"secretwisdom,\" [images/00061.jpg]. The triangle played a prominent part in the religious symbolism of every greatnation; for everywhere it represented the three great principles--spirit, force,and matter; or the active (male), passive (female), and the dual or correlativeprinciple which partakes of both and binds the two together. It was the Arba ormystic the thrice sacred science which teaches the Yajus (the sacrificial Mysteries). * Having done with the unrevealed triad, and the first triad of the Sephiroth,called the \"intellectual world,\" little remains to be said. In the greatgeometrical figure which has the double triangle in it, the central circlerepresents the world within the universe. The double triangle belongs to one ofthe most important, if it is not in itself the most important, of the mysticfigures in India. It is the emblem of the Trimurti three in one. The trianglewith its apex upward indicates the male principle, downward the female; the twotypifying, at the same time, spirit and matter. This world within the infiniteuniverse is the microcosm within the macrocosm, as in the Jewish Kabala. It isthe symbol of the womb of the universe, the terrestrial egg, whose archetype isthe golden mundane egg. It is from within this spiritual bosom of mother naturethat proceed all the great saviours of the universe--the avatars of theinvisible Deity. \"Of him who is and yet is not, from the not-being, Eternal Cause, is born thebeing Pouroucha,\" says Manu, the legislator. Pouroucha is the \"divine male,\" thesecond god, and the avatar, or the Logos of Para-Brahma and his divine son, whoin his turn produced Viradj, the son, or the ideal type of the universe. \"Viradjbegins the work of creation by producing the ten Pradjapati, 'the lords of allbeings.' \" According to the doctrine of Manu, the universe is subjected to a periodical andnever-ending succession of creations and dissolutions, which periods of creationare named Manvantara. \"It is the germ (which the Divine Spirit produced from its own substance) whichnever perishes in the being, for it becomes the soul of Being, and at the periodof pralaya (dissolution) it returns to absorb itself again into the DivineSpirit, which itself rests from all eternity \"four,\" *bthe mystery-gods, the Kabeiri, summarized in the unity of one supremeDeity. It is found in the Egyptian pyramids, whose equal sides tower up untillost in one crowning point. In the kabalistic diagram the central circle of theBrahmanical figure is replaced by the cross; the celestial perpendicular and theterrestrial horizontal base line. **b But the idea is the same: Adam Kadmon isthe type of humanity as a collective totality within the unity of the creativeGod and the universal spirit. within Swayambhuva, the 'Self-Existent' \" (Institute of Manu, book i.). As we have shown, neither the Svabhavikas, Buddhist philosophers--nor theBrahmans believe in a creation of the universe ex nihilo, but both believe inthe Prakriti, the indestructibility of matter. The evolution of species, and the successive appearance of various new types isvery distinctly shown in Manu. \"From earth, heat, and water, are born all creatures, whether animate orinanimate, produced by the germ which the Divine Spirit drew from its ownsubstance. Thus has Brahma established the series of transformations from theplant up to man, and from man up to the primordial essence. . . . Among themeach succeeding being (or element) acquires the quality of the preceding; and inas many degrees as each of them is advanced, with so many properties is it saidto be endowed\" (Manu, book i., sloka 20). * This, we believe, is the veritable theory of the modern evolutionists. \"Of him who is formless, the non-existent (also the eternal, but not FirstCause), is born the heavenly man.\" But after he created the form of the heavenlyman [images/00062.jpg], he \"used it as a vehicle wherein to descend,\" says theKabala. Thus Adam Kadmon is the avatar of the concealed power. After that theheavenly Adam creates or engenders by the combined power of the Sephiroth, theearthly Adam. The work of creation is also begun by Sephira in the creation ofthe ten Sephiroth (who are the Pradjapatis of the Kabala, for they are likewisethe Lords of all beings). The Sohar asserts the same. According to the kabalistic doctrine there were oldworlds (see Idra Suta: Sohar, iii., p. 292b). Everything will return some day tothat from which it first proceeded. \"All things of which this world consists,spirit as well as body, will return to their principal, and the roots from whichthey proceeded\" (Sohar, ii., 218b). The kabalists also maintain theindestructibility of matter, albeit their doctrine is shrouded still morecarefully than that of the Hindus. The creation is eternal, and the universe isthe \"garment,\" or \"the veil of God\"--Shekinah; and the latter is immortal andeternal as Him within whom it has ever existed. Every world is made after thepattern of its predecessor, and each more gross and material than the precedingone. In the Kabala all were called sparks. Finally, our present grosslymaterialistic world was formed. In the Chaldean account of the period which preceded the Genesis of our world,Berosus speaks of a time when there existed nothing but darkness, and an abyssof waters, filled with hideous monsters, \"produced of a two-fold principle. . .. These were creatures in which were combined the limbs of every species ofanimals. In addition to these fishes, reptiles, serpents, with other monstrousanimals, which assumed each other's shape and countenance.\" *b In the first book of Manu, we read: \"Know that the sum of 1,000 divine ages,composes the totality of one day of Brahma; and that one night is equal to thatday.\" One thousand divine ages is equal to 4,320,000,000 of human years, in theBrahmanical calculations. \"At the expiration of each night, Brahma, who has been asleep, awakes, andthrough the sole energy of the motion causes to emanate from himself the spirit,which in its essence is, and yet is not.\" \"Prompted by the desire to create, the Spirit (first of the emanations) operatesthe creation and gives birth to ether, which the sages consider as having thefaculty of transmitting sound. \"Ether begets air whose property is tangible, and which is necessary to life. \"Through a transformation of the air, light is produced. \"From air and light, which begets heat, water is formed, and the water is thewomb of all the living germs.\" Throughout the whole immense period of progressive creation, covering4,320,000,000 years, ether, air, water and fire (heat), are constantly formingmatter under the never-ceasing impulse of the Spirit, or the unrevealed God whofills up the whole creation, for he is in all, and all is in him. Thiscomputation, which was secret and which is hardly hinted at even now, ledHiggins into the error of dividing every ten ages into 6,000 years. Had he addeda few more ciphers to his sums he might have come nearer to a correctexplanation of the neroses, or secret cycles. * In the Sepher Jezireh, the kabalistic Book of Creation, the author has evidentlyrepeated the words of Manu. In it, the Divine Substance is represented as havingalone existed from the eternity, boundless and absolute; and emitted from itselfthe Spirit. \"One is the Spirit of the living God, blessed be His Name, wholiveth for ever! Voice, Spirit, and Word, this is the Holy Spirit\"; ** and thisis the kabalistic abstract Trinity, so unceremoniously anthropomorphized by theFathers. From this triple ONE emanated the whole Cosmos. First from ONE emanatednumber TWO, or Air, the creative element; and then number THREE, Water,proceeded from the air; Ether or Fire complete the mystic four, the Arba-il. ***\"When the Concealed of the Concealed wanted to reveal Himself, he first made apoint (primordial point, or the first Sephira, air or Holy Ghost), shaped itinto a sacred form (the ten Sephiroth, or the Heavenly man), and covered it witha rich and splendid garment, that is the world.\" ****\"He maketh the wind Hismessengers, flaming Fire his servants,\" says the Jezireh, showing the cosmicalcharacter of the later euhemerized angels, * and that the Spirit permeates everyminutest atom of the Cosmos. ** When the cycle of creation is run down, the energy of the manifested word isweakening. He alone, the Unconceivable, is unchangeable (ever latent), but theCreative Force, though also eternal, as it has been in the former from \"nobeginning,\" yet must be subject to periodical cycles of activity and rest; as ithad a beginning in one of its aspects, when it first emanated, therefore mustalso have an end. Thus, the evening succeeds the day, and the night of the deityapproaches. Brahma is gradually falling asleep. In one of the books of Sohar, weread the following: \"As Moses was keeping a vigil on Mount Sinai, in company with the Deity, who wasconcealed from his sight by a cloud, he felt a great fear overcome him andsuddenly asked: 'Lord, where art Thou . . . sleepest thou, O Lord?' And theSpirit answered him: 'I never sleep; were I to fall asleep for a moment beforemy time, all the Creation would crumble into dissolution in one instant.' \" AndVamadeva-Modely describes the \"Night of Brahma,\" or the second period of theDivine Unknown existence, thus: \"Strange noises are heard, proceeding from every point. . . . These are theprecursors of the Night of Brahma; dusk rises at the horizon and the Sun passesaway behind the thirtieth degree of Macara (sign of the zodiac), and will reachno more the sign of the Minas (zodiacal pisces, or fish). The gurus of thepagodas appointed to watch the ras-chakr (Zodiac), may now break their circleand instruments, for they are henceforth useless. \"Gradually light pales, heat diminishes, uninhabitable spots multiply on theearth, the air becomes more and more rarefied; the springs of waters dry up, thegreat rivers see their waves exhausted, the ocean shows its sandy bottom, andplants die. Men and animals decrease in size daily. Life and motion lose theirforce, planets can hardly gravitate in space; they are extinguished one by one,like a lamp which the hand of the chokra (servant) neglects to replenish. Sourya(the Sun) flickers and goes out, matter falls into dissolution (pralaya), andBrahma merges back into Dyaus, the Unrevealed God, and his task beingaccomplished, he falls asleep. Another day is passed, night sets in andcontinues until the future dawn. \"And now again re-enter into the golden egg of His Thought, the germs of allthat exist, as the divine Manu tells us. During His peaceful rest, the animatedbeings, endowed with the principles of action, cease their functions, and allfeeling (manas) becomes dormant. When they are all absorbed in the SUPREME SOUL,this Soul of all the beings sleeps in complete repose, till the day when itresumes its form, and awakes again from its primitive darkness.\" * If we now examine the ten mythical avatars of Vishnu, we find them recorded inthe following progression: 1. Matsya-Avatar: as a fish. It will also be his tenth and last avatar, at theend of the Kali-yug.2. Kurm-Avatar: as a tortoise.3. Varaha: as a boar.4. Nara-Sing: as a man-lion; last animal stage.5. Vamuna: as a dwarf; first step toward the human form.6. Parasu-Rama: as a hero, but yet an imperfect man.7. Rama-Chandra: as the hero of Ramayana. Physically a perfect man; his next ofkin, friend and ally Hanouma, the monkey-god. The monkey endowed with speech. ** 8. Christna-Avatar: the Son of the Virgin Devanaguy (or Devaki) one formedby God, or rather by the manifested Deity Vishnu, who is identical with AdamKadmon. *** Christna is also called Kaneya, the Son of the Virgin.9. Gautama-Buddha, Siddhartha, or Sakya-muni. (The Buddhists reject thisdoctrine of their Buddha being an incarnation of Vishnu.)10. This avatar has not yet occurred. It is expected in the future, like theChristian Advent, the idea of which was undoubtedly copied from the Hindu. WhenVishnu appears for the last time he will come as a \"Saviour.\" According to theopinion of some Brahmans he will appear himself under the form of the horseKalki. Others maintain that he will be mounting it. This horse is the envelopeof the spirit of evil, and Vishnu will mount it, invisible to all, till he hasconquered it for the last time. The \"Kalki-Avataram,\" or the last incarnation,divides Brahmanism into two sects. That of the Vaihnava refuses to recognize theincarnations of their god Vishnu in animal forms literally. They claim thatthese must be understood as allegorical. In this diagram of avatars we see traced the gradual evolution andtransformation of all species out of the ante-Silurian mud of Darwin and theilus of Sanchoniathon and Berosus. Beginning with the Azoic time, correspondingto the ilus in which Brahma implants the creative germ, we pass through thePalaeozoic and Mesozoic times, covered by the first and second incarnations asthe fish and tortoise; and the Cenozoic, which is embraced by the incarnationsin the animal and semi-human forms of the boar and man-lion; and we come to thefifth and crowning geological period, designated as the \"era of mind, or age ofman,\" whose symbol in the Hindu mythology is the dwarf--the first attempt ofnature at the creation of man. In this diagram we should follow the main idea,not judge the degree of knowledge of the ancient philosophers by the literalacceptance of the popular form in which it is presented to us in the grandepical poem of Maha-Bharata and its chapter the Bagaved-gitta. Even the four ages of the Hindu chronology contain a far more philosophical ideathan appears on the surface. It defines them according to both the psychologicalor mental and the physical states of man during their period. Crita-yug, thegolden age, the \"age of joy,\" or spiritual innocence of man; Treta-yug, the ageof silver, or that of fire--the period of supremacy of man and of giants and ofthe sons of God; Dwapara-yug, the age of bronze--a mixture already of purity andimpurity (spirit and matter) the age of doubt; and at last our own, theKali-yug, or age of iron, of darkness, misery, and sorrow. In this age, Vishnuhad to incarnate himself in Christna, in order to save humanity from the goddessKali, consort of Siva, the all-annihilating--the goddess of death, destruction,and human misery. Kali is the best emblem to represent the \"fall of man\"; thefalling of spirit into the degradation of matter, with all its terrific results.We have to rid ourselves of Kali before we can ever reach \"Moksha,\" or Nirvana,the abode of blessed Peace and Spirit. With the Buddhists the last incarnation is the fifth. When Maitree-Buddha comes,then our present world will be destroyed; and a new and a better one willreplace it. The four arms of every Hindu Deity are the emblems of the fourpreceding manifestations of our earth from its invisible state, while its headtypifies the fifth and last Kalki-Avatar, when this would be destroyed, and thepower of Budh--Wisdom (with the Hindus, of Brahma), will be again called intorequisition to manifest itself--as a Logos--to create the future world. In this diagram, the male gods typify Spirit in its deific attributes whiletheir female counterparts--the Sakti, represent the active energies of theseattributes. The Durga (active virtue), is a subtile, invisible force, whichanswers to Shekinah--the garment of En-Soph. She is the Sakti through which thepassive \"Eternal\" calls forth the visible universe from its first idealconception. Every one of the three personages of the exoteric Trimurti are shownas using their Sakti as a Vehan (vehicle). Each of them is for the time beingthe form which sits upon the mysterious wagon of Ezekiel. Nor do we see less clearly carried out in this succession of avatars, the trulyphilosophical idea of a simultaneous spiritual and physical evolution ofcreatures and man. From a fish the progress of this dual transformation carrieson the physical form through the shape of a tortoise, a boar, and a man-lion;and then, appearing in the dwarf of humanity, it shows Parasu Rama physically, aperfect, spiritually, an undeveloped entity, until it carries mankindpersonified by one god-like man, to the apex of physical and spiritualperfection--a god on earth. In Christna and the other Saviours of the world wesee the philosophical idea of the progressive dual development understood and asclearly expressed in the Sohar. The \"Heavenly man,\" who is the Protogonos,Tikkun, the first-born of God, or the universal Form and Idea, engenders Adam.Hence the latter is god-born in humanity, and endowed with the attributes of allthe ten Sephiroth. These are: Wisdom, Intelligence, Justice, Love, Beauty,Splendor, Firmness, etc. They make him the Foundation or basis, \"the mightyliving one,\" [images/00063.jpg], and the crown of creation, thus placing him asthe Alpha and Omega to reign over the \"kingdom\"--Malchuth. \"Man is both theimport and the highest degree of creation,\" says the Sohar. \"As soon as man wascreated, everything was complete, including the upper and nether worlds, foreverything is comprised in man. He unites in himself all forms\" (iii., p. 48 a). But this does not relate to our degenerated mankind; it is only occasionallythat men are born who are the types of what man should be, and yet is not. Thefirst races of men were spiritual, and their protoplastic bodies were notcomposed of the gross and material substances of which we see them composednow-a-day. The first men were created with all the faculties of the Deity, andpowers far transcending those of the angelic host; for they were the directemanations of Adam Kadmon, the primitive man, the Macrocosm; while the presenthumanity is several degrees removed even from the earthly Adam, who was theMicrocosm, or \"the little world.\" Seir Anpin, the mystical figure of the Man,consists of 243 numbers, and we see in the circles which follow each other thatit is the angels which emanated from the \"Primitive Man,\" not the Sephiroth fromangels. Hence, man was intended from the first to be a being of both aprogressive and retrogressive nature. Beginning at the apex of the divine cycle,he gradually began receding from the centre of Light, acquiring at every new andlower sphere of being (worlds each inhabited by a different race of humanbeings) a more solid physical form and losing a portion of his divine faculties. In the \"fall of Adam\" we must see, not the personal transgression of man, butsimply the law of the dual evolution. Adam, or \"Man,\" begins his career ofexistences by dwelling in the garden of Eden, \"dressed in the celestial garment,which is a garment of heavenly light\" (Sohar, ii., 229 b); but when expelled heis \"clothed\" by God, or the eternal law of Evolution or necessarianism, withcoats of skin. But even on this earth of material degradation--in which thedivine spark (Soul, a corruscation of the Spirit) was to begin its physicalprogression in a series of imprisonments from a stone up to a man's body--if hebut exercise his WILL and call his deity to his help, man can transcend thepowers of the angel. \"Know ye not that we shall judge angels?\" asks Paul (1Corinthians, vi. 3). The real man is the Soul (Spirit), teaches the Sohar. \"Themystery of the earthly man is after the mystery of the heavenly man . . . thewise can read the mysteries in the human face\" (ii., 76 a). This is still another of the many sentences by which Paul must be recognized asan initiate. For reasons fully explained, we give far more credit forgenuineness to certain Epistles of the apostles, now dismissed as apocryphal,than to many suspicious portions of the Acts. And we find corroboration of thisview in the Epistle of Paul to Seneca. In this message Paul styles Seneca \"myrespected master,\" while Seneca terms the apostle simply \"brother.\" No more than the true religion of Judaic philosophy can be judged by theabsurdities of the exoteric Bible, have we any right to form an opinion ofBrahmanism and Buddhism by their nonsensical and sometimes disgusting popularforms. If we only search for the true essence of the philosophy of both Manu andthe Kabala, we will find that Vishnu is, as well as Adam Kadmon, the expressionof the universe itself; and that his incarnations are but concrete and variousembodiments of the manifestations of this \"Stupendous Whole.\" \"I am the Soul, O,Arjuna. I am the Soul which exists in the heart of all beings; and I am thebeginning and the middle, and also the end of existing things,\" says Vishnu tohis disciple, in Bagaved-gitta (ch. x., p. 71). \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. . . . I am the first and thelast,\" says Jesus to John (Rev. i. 6, 17). Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva are a trinity in a unity, and, like the Christiantrinity, they are mutually convertible. In the esoteric doctrine they are oneand the same manifestation of him \"whose name is too sacred to be pronounced,and whose power is too majestic and infinite to be imagined.\" Thus by describingthe avatars of one, all others are included in the allegory, with a change ofform but not of substance. It is out of such manifestations that emanated themany worlds that were, and that will emanate the one--which is to come. Coleman, followed in it by other Orientalists, presents the seventh avatar ofVishnu in the most caricatured way. * Apart from the fact that the Ramayana isone of the grandest epic poems in the world--the source and origin of Homer'sinspiration--this avatar conceals one of the most scientific problems of ourmodern day. The learned Brahmans of India never understood the allegory of thefamous war between men, giants, and monkeys, otherwise than in the light of thetransformation of species. It is our firm belief that were European academiciansto seek for information from some learned native Brahmans, instead ofunanimously and incontinently rejecting their authority, and were they, likeJacolliot--against whom they have nearly all arrayed themselves--to seek forlight in the oldest documents scattered about the country in pagodas, they mightlearn strange but not useless lessons. Let any one inquire of an educatedBrahman the reason for the respect shown to monkeys--the origin of which feelingis indicated in the story of the valorous feats of Hanouma, the generalissimoand faithful ally of the hero of Ramayana, ** and he would soon be disabused ofthe erroneous idea that the Hindus accord deific honors to a monkey-god. Hewould, perhaps, learn--were the Brahman to judge him worthy of anexplanation--that the Hindu sees in the ape but what Manu desired he should: thetransformation of species most directly connected with that of the humanfamily--a bastard branch engrafted on their own stock before the finalperfection of the latter. *** He might learn, further, that in the eyes of theeducated \"heathen\" the spiritual or inner man is one thing, and his terrestrial,physical casket another. That physical nature, the great combination of physicalcorrelations of forces ever creeping on toward perfection, has to avail herselfof the material at hand; she models and remodels as she proceeds, and finishingher crowning work in man, presents him alone as a fit tabernacle for theovershadowing of the Divine spirit. But the latter circumstance does not giveman the right of life and death over the animals lower than himself in the scaleof nature, or the right to torture them. Quite the reverse. Besides beingendowed with a soul--of which every animal, and even plant, is more or lesspossessed--man has his immortal rational soul, or nous, which ought to make himat least equal in magnanimity to the elephant, who treads so carefully, lest heshould crush weaker creatures than himself. It is this feeling which promptsBrahman and Buddhist alike to construct hospitals for sick animals, and eveninsects, and to prepare refuges wherein they may finish their days. It is thissame feeling, again, which causes the Jain sectarian to sacrifice one-half ofhis life-time to brushing away from his path the helpless, crawling insects,rather than recklessly deprive the smallest of life; and it is again from thissense of highest benevolence and charity toward the weaker, however abject thecreature may be, that they honor one of the natural modifications of their owndual nature, and that later the popular belief in metempsychosis arose. No traceof the latter is to be found in the Vedas; and the true interpretation of thedoctrine, discussed at length in Manu and the Buddhistic sacred books, havingbeen confined from the first to the learned sacerdotal castes, the false andfoolish popular ideas concerning it need occasion no surprise. Upon those who, in the remains of antiquity, see evidence that modern times canlay small claim to originality, it is common to charge a disposition toexaggerate and distort facts. But the candid reader will scarcely aver that theabove is an example in point. There were evolutionists before the day when themythical Noah is made, in the Bible, to float in his ark; and the ancientscientists were better informed, and had their theories more logically definedthan the modern evolutionists. Plato, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras, the Eleatic schools of Greece, as well as the oldChaldean sacerdotal colleges, all taught the doctrine of the dual evolution; thedoctrine of the transmigration of souls referring only to the progress of manfrom world to world, after death here. Every philosophy worthy of the name,taught that the spirit of man, if not the soul, was preexistent. \"The Essenes,\"says Josephus, \"believed that the souls were immortal, and that they descendedfrom the ethereal spaces to be chained to bodies.\" * In his turn, Philo Judaeussays, the \"air is full of them (of souls); those which are nearest the earth,descending to be tied to mortal bodies, παλινδρομουσιν αυθις, return to otherbodies, being desirous to live in them.\" ** In the Sohar, the soul is made toplead her freedom before God: \"Lord of the Universe! I am happy in this world,and do not wish to go into another world, where I shall be a handmaid, and beexposed to all kinds of pollutions.\" *** The doctrine of fatal necessity, theeverlasting immutable Law, is asserted in the answer of the Deity: \"Against thywill thou becomest an embryo, and against thy will thou art born.\" **** Lightwould be incomprehensible without darkness, to make it manifest by contrast;good would be no good without evil, to show the priceless nature of the boon;and so, personal virtue could claim no merit, unless it had passed through thefurnace of temptation. Nothing is eternal and unchangeable, save the ConcealedDeity. Nothing that is finite--whether because it had a beginning, or must havean end--can remain stationary. It must either progress or recede; and a soulwhich thirsts after a reunion with its spirit, which alone confers upon itimmortality, must purify itself through cyclic transmigrations, onward towardthe only Land of Bliss and Eternal Rest, called in the Sohar, \"The Palace ofLove,\" [images/00064.jpg]; in the Hindu religion, \"Moksha\"; among the Gnostics,the \"Pleroma of eternal Light\"; and by the Buddhists, Nirvana. The Christiancalls it the \"Kingdom of Heaven,\" and claims to have alone found the truth,whereas he has but invented a new name for a doctrine which is coeval with man. The proof that the transmigration of the soul does not relate to man's conditionon this earth after death, is found in the Sohar, notwithstanding the manyincorrect renderings of its translators. \"All souls which have alienatedthemselves in heaven from the Holy One--blessed be His Name--have thrownthemselves into an abyss at their very existence, and have anticipated the timewhen they are to descend on earth. ***** . . . Come and see when the soul reaches the abode of Love. . . . The soul could notbear this light, but for the luminous mantle which she puts on. For, just as thesoul, when sent to this earth, puts on an earthly garment to preserve herselfhere, so she receives above a shining garment, in order to be able to lookwithout injury into the mirror, whose light proceeds from the Lord of Light.\" *Moreover, the Sohar teaches that the soul cannot reach the abode of bliss,unless she has received the \"holy kiss,\" or the re-union of the soul with thesubstance from which she emanated--spirit. All souls are dual, and, while thelatter is a feminine principle, the spirit is masculine. While imprisoned inbody, man is a trinity, unless his pollution is such as to have caused hisdivorce from the spirit. \"Woe to the soul which prefers to her divine husband(spirit), the earthly wedlock with her terrestrial body,\" records a text of theBook of the Keys. ** These ideas on the transmigrations and the trinity of man, were held by many ofthe early Christian Fathers. It is the jumble made by the translators of the NewTestament and ancient philosophical treatises between soul and spirit, that hasoccasioned the many misunderstandings. It is also one of the many reasons whyBuddha, Plotinus, and so many other initiates are now accused of having longedfor the total extinction of their souls--\"absorption unto the Deity,\" or\"reunion with the universal soul,\" meaning, according to modern ideas,annihilation. The animal soul must, of course, be disintegrated of itsparticles, before it is able to link its purer essence forever with the immortalspirit. But the translators of both the Acts and the Epistles, who laid thefoundation of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the modern commentators on the BuddhistSutra of the Foundation of the Kingdom of Righteousness, have muddled the senseof the great apostle of Christianity, as of the great reformer of India. Theformer have smothered the word ψυχικος, so that no reader imagines it to haveany relation with soul; and with this confusion of soul and spirit together,Bible readers get only a perverted sense of anything on the subject; and theinterpreters of the latter have failed to understand the meaning and object ofthe Buddhist four degrees of Dhyana. In the writings of Paul, the entity of man is divided into a trine--flesh,psychical existence or soul, and the overshadowing and at the same time interiorentity or SPIRIT. His phraseology is very definite, when he teaches theanastasis, or the continuation of life of those who have died. He maintains thatthere is a psychical body which is sown in the corruptible, and a spiritual bodythat is raised in incorruptible substance. \"The first man is of the earth earthy, the second man from heaven.\" Even James(iii. 15) identifies the soul by saying that its \"wisdom descendeth not from theabove but is terrestrial, psychical, demoniacal\" (see Greek text). Plato,speaking of the Soul (psuche), observes that \"when she allies herself to thenous (divine substance, a god, as psuche is a goddess), she does everythingaright and felicitously; but the case is otherwise when she attaches herself toAnnoia.\" What Plato calls nous, Paul terms the Spirit; and Jesus makes the heartwhat Paul says of the flesh. The natural condition of mankind was called inGreek αποστασια the new condition αναστασις. In Adam came the former (death), inChrist the latter (resurrection), for it is he who first publicly taught mankindthe \"Noble Path\" to Eternal life, as Gautama pointed the same Path to Nirvana.To accomplish both ends there was but one way, according to the teachings ofboth. \"Poverty, chastity, contemplation or inner prayer; contempt for wealth andthe illusive joys of this world.\" \"Enter on this Path and put an end to sorrow; verily the Path has been preachedby me, who have found out how to quench the darts of grief. You yourselves mustmake the effort; the Buddhas are only preachers. The thoughtful who enter thePath are freed from the bondage of the Deceiver (Mara).\" * \"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way thatleadeth to destruction. . . . Follow me. . . . Every one that heareth thesesayings and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man\" (Matthew vii.and viii.). \"I can of mine own self do nothing\" (John v. 30). \"The care of thisworld, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word\" (Matthew xiii. 22), saythe Christians; and it is only by shaking off all delusions that the Buddhistenters on the \"Path\" which will lead him \"away from the restless tossing wavesof the ocean of life,\" and take him \"to the calm City of Peace, to the real joyand rest of Nirvana.\" The Greek philosophers are alike made misty instead of mystic by their toolearned translators. The Egyptians revered the Divine Spirit, the One-Only One,as NOUT. It is most evident that it is from that word that Anaxagoras borrowedhis denominative nous, or, as he calls it, Νους αυτοκρατες--the Mind or Spiritself-potent, the αρ{! 0x63 c !}cηετες κινεσεος. \"All things,\" says he, \"were inchaos; then came Nous and introduced order.\" He also denominated this Nous theOne that ruled the many. In his idea Nous was God; and the Logos was man, theemanation of the former. The external powers perceived phenomena; the nous alonerecognized noumena or subjective things. This is purely Buddhistic and esoteric. Here Socrates took his clew and followed it, and Plato after him, with the wholeworld of interior knowledge. Where the old Ionico-Italian world culminated inAnaxagoras, the new world began with Socrates and Plato. Pythagoras made theSoul a self-moving unit, with three elements, the nous, the phren and thethumos; the latter two, shared with the brutes; the former only, being hisessential self. So the charge that he taught transmigration is refuted; hetaught no more than Gautama-Buddha ever did, whatever the popular superstitionof the Hindu rabble made of it after his death. Whether Pythagoras borrowed fromBuddha, or Buddha from somebody else, matters not; the esoteric doctrine is thesame. The Platonic School is even more distinct in enunciating all this. The real selfhood was at the basis of all. Socrates therefore taught that he hada daimonion, a spiritual something which put him in the road to wisdom. Hehimself knew nothing, but this put him in the way to learn all. Plato followed him with a full investigation of the principles of being. Therewas an Agathon, Supreme God, who produced in his own mind a paradeigma of allthings. He taught that in man was \"the immortal principle of the soul,\" a mortal body,and a \"separate mortal kind of soul,\" which was placed in a separate receptacleof the body from the other; the immortal part was in the head (Timaeus xix.,xx.) the other in the trunk (xliv.). Nothing is plainer than that Plato regarded the interior man as constituted oftwo parts--one always the same, formed of the same entity as Deity, and onemortal and corruptible. \"Plato and Pythagoras,\" says Plutarch, \"distribute the soul into two parts, therational (noetic) and irrational (agnoia); that that part of the soul of manwhich is rational, is eternal; for though it be not God, yet it is the productof an eternal deity, but that part of the soul which is divested of reason(agnoia) dies.\" \"Man,\" says Plutarch, \"is compound; and they are mistaken who think him to becompounded of two parts only. For they imagine that the understanding is a partof the soul, but they err in this no less than those who make the soul to be apart of the body, for the understanding (nous) as far exceeds the soul, as thesoul is better and diviner than the body. Now this composition of the soul(ψυχε) with the understanding (νουσ) makes reason; and with the body, passion;of which the one is the beginning or principle of pleasure and pain, and theother of virtue and vice. Of these three parts conjoined and compacted together,the earth has given the body, the moon the soul, and the sun the understandingto the generation of man. \"Now of the deaths we die, the one makes man two of three, and the other, one of(out of) two. The former is in the region and jurisdiction of Demeter, whencethe name given to the Mysteries τελειν resembled that given to death, τελευταν.The Athenians also heretofore called the deceased sacred to Demeter. As for theother death it is in the moon or region of Persephone. And as with the one theterrestrial, so with the other the celestial Hermes doth dwell. This suddenlyand with violence plucks the soul from the body; but Proserpina mildly and in along time disjoins the understanding from the soul. For this reason she iscalled Monogenes, only-begotten, or rather begetting one alone; for the betterpart of man becomes alone when it is separated by her. Now both the one and theother happens thus according to nature. It is ordained by Faith that every soul,whether with or without understanding (νουσ), when gone out of the body, shouldwander for a time, though not all for the same, in the region lying between theearth and moon. For those that have been unjust and dissolute suffer there thepunishment due to their offences; but the good and virtuous are there detainedtill they are purified, and have, by expiation, purged out of them all theinfections they might have contracted from the contagion of the body, as if fromfoul health, living in the mildest part of the air, called the Meadows of Hades,where they must remain for a certain prefixed and appointed time. And then, asif they were returning from a wandering pilgrimage or long exile into theircountry, they have a taste of joy, such as they principally receive who areinitiated into Sacred Mysteries, mixed with trouble, admiration, and each one'sproper and peculiar hope.\" The daemonium of Socrates was this νουσ, mind, spirit, or understanding of thedivine in it. \"The νουσ of Socrates,\" says Plutarch, \"was pure and mixed itselfwith the body no more than necessity required. . . . Every soul hath someportion of νουσ, reason, a man cannot be a man without it; but as much of eachsoul as is mixed with flesh and appetite is changed and through pain or pleasurebecomes irrational. Every soul doth not mix herself after one sort; some plungethemselves into the body, and so, in this life their whole frame is corrupted byappetite and passion; others are mixed as to some part, but the purer part[nous] still remains without the body. It is not drawn down into the body, butit swims above and touches (overshadows) the extremest part of the man's head;it is like a cord to hold up and direct the subsiding part of the soul, as longas it proves obedient and is not overcome by the appetites of the flesh. Thepart that is plunged into the body is called soul. But the incorruptible part iscalled the nous and the vulgar think it is within them, as they likewise imaginethe image reflected from a glass to be in that glass. But the more intelligent,who know it to be without, call it a Daemon\" (a god, a spirit). \"The soul, like to a dream, flies quick away, which it does not immediately, assoon as it is separated from the body, but afterward, when it is alone anddivided from the understanding (nous). . . . The soul being moulded and formedby the understanding (nous), and itself moulding and forming the body, byembracing it on every side, receives from it an impression and form; so thatalthough it be separated both from the understanding and the body, itnevertheless so retains still its figure and resemblance for a long time, thatit may, with good right, be called its image. \"And of these souls the moon is the element, because souls resolve into her, asthe bodies of the deceased do into earth. Those, indeed, who have been virtuousand honest, living a quiet and philosophical life, without embroiling themselvesin troublesome affairs, are quickly resolved; because, being left by the nous,understanding, and no longer using the corporeal passions, they incontinentlyvanish away.\" We find even Irenaeus, that untiring and mortal enemy of every Grecian and\"heathen\" heresy, explain his belief in the trinity of man. The perfect man,according to his views, consists of flesh, soul, and spirit. \". . . carne,anima, spiritu, altero quidem figurante, spiritu, altero quod formatur, carne.Id vero quod inter haec est duo, est anima, quae aliquando subsequens spiritumelevatur ab eo, aliquando autem consentiens carni in terrenas concupiscentias\"(Irenaeus v., 1). And Origen, in his Sixth Epistle to the Romans, says: \"There is a threefoldpartition of man, the body or flesh, the lowest part of our nature, on which theold serpent by original sin inscribed the law of sin, and by which we aretempted to vile things, and as oft as we are overcome by temptations are joinedfast to the Devil; the spirit, in or by which we express the likeness of thedivine nature in which the very Best Creator, from the archetype of his ownmind, engraved with his finger (that is, his spirit), the eternal law ofhonesty; by this we are joined (conglutinated) to God and made one with God. Inthe third, the soul mediates between these, which, as in a factious republic,cannot but join with one party or the other, is solicited this way and that andis at liberty to choose the side to which it will adhere. If, renouncing theflesh, it betakes itself to the party of the spirit it will itself becomespiritual, but if it cast itself down to the cupidities of the flesh it willdegenerate itself into body.\" Plato (in Laws x.) defines soul as \"the motion that is able to move itself.\"\"Soul is the most ancient of all things, and the commencement of motion.\" \"Soulwas generated prior to body, and body is posterior and secondary, as being,according to nature, ruled over by the ruling soul.\" \"The soul which administersall things that are moved in every way, administers likewise the heavens.\" \"Soul then leads everything in heaven, and on earth, and in the sea, by itsmovements--the names of which are, to will, to consider, to take care of, toconsult, to form opinions true and false, to be in a state of joy, sorrow,confidence, fear, hate, love, together with all such primary movements as areallied to these . . . being a goddess herself, she ever takes as an ally NOUS, agod, and disciplines all things correctly and happily; but when with Annoia--notnous--it works out everything the contrary.\" In this language, as in the Buddhist texts, the negative is treated as essentialexistence. Annihilation comes under a similar exegesis. The positive state, isessential being but no manifestation as such. When the spirit, in Buddhisticparlance, entered nirvana, it lost objective existence but retained subjective.To objective minds this is becoming absolute nothing; to subjective, NO-thing,nothing to be displayed to sense. These rather lengthy quotations are necessary for our purpose. Better thananything else, they show the agreement between the oldest \"Pagan\"philosophies--not \"assisted by the light of divine revelation,\" to use thecurious expression of Laboulaye in relation to Buddha--and the earlyChristianity of some Fathers. Both Pagan philosophy and Christianity, however,owe their elevated ideas on the soul and spirit of man and the unknown Deity toBuddhism and the Hindu Manu. No wonder that the Manicheans maintained that Jesuswas a permutation of Gautama; that Buddha, Christ, and Mani were one and thesame person, * for the teachings of the former two were identical. It was thedoctrine of old India that Jesus held to when preaching the completerenunciation of the world and its vanities in order to reach the kingdom ofHeaven, Nirvana, where \"men neither marry nor are given in marriage, but livelike the angels.\" It is the philosophy of Siddhartha-Buddha again that Pythagoras expounded, whenasserting that the ego (νουσ) was eternal with God, and that the soul onlypassed through various stages (Hindu Rupa-locas) to arrive at the divineexcellence; meanwhile the thumos returned to the earth, and even the phren waseliminated. Thus the metempsychosis was only a succession of disciplines throughrefuge-heavens (called by the Buddhists Zion), ** to work off the exterior mind,to rid the nous of the phren, or soul, the Buddhist \"Winyanaskandaya,\" thatprinciple that lives from Karma and the Skandhas (groups). It is the latter, themetaphysical personations of the \"deeds\" of man, whether good or bad, which,after the death of his body, incarnate themselves, so to say, and form theirmany invisible but never-dying compounds into a new body, or rather into anethereal being, the double of what man was morally. It is the astral body of thekabalist and the \"incarnated deeds\" which form the new sentient self as hisAhancara (the ego, self-consciousness), given to him by the sovereign Master(the breath of God) can never perish, for it is immortal per se as a spirit;hence the sufferings of the newly-born self till he rids himself of everyearthly thought, desire, and passion. We now see that the \"four mysteries\" of the Buddhist doctrine have been aslittle understood and appreciated as the \"wisdom\" hinted at by Paul, and spoken\"among them that are perfect\" (initiated), the \"mystery-wisdom\" which \"none ofthe Archons of this world knew.\" * The fourth degree of the Buddhist Dhyana, thefruit of Samadhi, which leads to the utmost perfection, to Viconddham, a termcorrectly rendered by Burnouf in the verb \"perfected,\" ** is whollymisunderstood by others, as well as in himself. Defining the condition ofDhyana, St. Hilaire argues thus: \"Finally, having attained the fourth degree, the ascetic possesses no more thisfeeling of beatitude, however obscure it may be . . . he has also lost allmemory . . . he has reached impassibility, as near a neighbor of Nirvana as canbe. . . . However, this absolute impassibility does not hinder the ascetic fromacquiring, at this very moment, omniscience and the magical power; a flagrantcontradiction, about which the Buddhists no more disturb themselves than aboutso many others.\" *** And why should they, when these contradictions are, in fact, no contradictionsat all? It ill behooves us to speak of contradictions in other peoples'religions, when those of our own have bred, besides the three great conflictingbodies of Romanism, Protestantism, and the Eastern Church, a thousand and onemost curious smaller sects. However it may be, we have here a term applied toone and the same thing by the Buddhist holy \"mendicants\" and Paul, the Apostle.When the latter says: \"If so be that I might attain the resurrection from amongthe dead [the Nirvana], not as though I had already attained, or were alreadyperfect\" (initiated), **** he uses an expression common among the initiatedBuddhists. When a Buddhist ascetic has reached the \"fourth degree,\" he isconsidered a rahat. He produces every kind of phenomena by the sole power of hisfreed spirit. A rahat, say the Buddhists, is one who has acquired the power offlying in the air, becoming invisible, commanding the elements, and working allmanner of wonders, commonly, and as erroneously, called meipo (miracles). He isa perfect man, a demi-god. A god he will become when he reaches Nirvana; for,like the initiates of both Testaments, the worshippers of Buddha know that they\"are gods.\" \"Genuine Buddhism, overleaping the barrier between finite and infinite mind,urges its followers to aspire, by their own efforts, to that divineperfectibility of which it teaches that man is capable, and by attaining whichman becomes a god,\" says Brian Houghton Hodgson. * Dreary and sad were the ways, and blood-covered the tortuous paths by which theworld of the Christians was driven to embrace the Irenaean and EusebianChristianity. And yet, unless we accept the views of the ancient Pagans, whatclaim has our generation to having solved any of the mysteries of the \"kingdomof heaven\"? What more does the most pious and learned of Christians know of thefuture destiny and progress of our immortal spirits than the heathen philosopherof old, or the modern \"Pagan\" beyond the Himalaya? Can he even boast that heknows as much, although he works in the full blaze of \"divine\" revelation? Wehave seen a Buddhist holding to the religion of his fathers, both in theory andpractice; and, however blind may be his faith, however absurd his notions onsome particular doctrinal points, later engraftings of an ambitious clergy, yetin practical works his Buddhism is far more Christ-like in deed and spirit thanthe average life of our Christian priests and ministers. The fact alone that hisreligion commands him to \"honor his own faith, but never slander that of otherpeople,\" ** is sufficient. It places the Buddhist lama immeasurably higher thanany priest or clergyman who deems it his sacred duty to curse the \"heathen\" tohis face, and sentence him and his religion to \"eternal damnation.\" Christianitybecomes every day more a religion of pure emotionalism. The doctrine of Buddhais entirely based on practical works. A general love of all beings, human andanimal, is its nucleus. A man who knows that unless he toils for himself he hasto starve, and understands that he has no scapegoat to carry the burden of hisiniquities for him, is ten times as likely to become a better man than one whois taught that murder, theft, and profligacy can be washed in one instant aswhite as snow, if he but believes in a God who, to borrow an expression ofVolney, \"once took food upon earth, and is now himself the food of his people.\" [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES251:* Socrates; \"Scol.

Heis--as we shall show in Chapter VIII.--Noah, and his six sons, or subsequentgenerations are the originals of the post-diluvian and mythical patriarchs ofthe Bible. 271:*b Cory's \"Ancient Fragments.\" 272:* See Vol. I., chap. i., pp. 33, 34, of this work. 272:** \"Sepher Jezireh,\" chap. i., Mishna ixth. 272:*** Ibid. 272:**** \"Sohar,\" i., 2 a. 273:* \"Sepher Jezireh,\" Mishna ix., 10. 273:** It is interesting to recall Hebrews i. 7, in connection with thispassage. \"Who maketh his angels (messengers) spirits, and his ministers(servants, those who minister) a flame of fire.\" The resemblance is too strikingfor us to avoid the conclusion that the author of \"Hebrews\" was as familiar withthe \"Kabala\" as adepts usually are. 274:* \"The Sons of God\"; \"The India of the Brahmans,\" p. 230. 274:** May it not be that Hanouma is the representative of that link of beingshalf-man, half-monkeys, which, according to the theories of Messrs.

That,in the beginning, mankind were, morally and physically, the types and prototypesof our present race and of human dignity, by their beauty of form, regularity offeature, cranial development, nobility of sentiments, heroic impulses, andgrandeur of ideal conceptions. This is a purely Brahmanic, Buddhistic, andkabalistic philosophy. His book is copiously illustrated p. 279 with diagrams,tables, etc. He says that the gradual debasement and degradation of man, morallyand physically, can be readily traced throughout the ethnologicaltransformations down to our times. And, as one portion has already degeneratedinto apes, so the civilized man of the present day will at last, under theaction of the inevitable law of necessity, be also succeeded by likedescendants.

Glancing rapidly at the Ophites and Nazareans, we shall pass to their scionswhich yet exist in Syria and Palestine, under the name of Druzes of MountLebanon; and near Basra or Bassorah, in Persia, under that of Mendaeans, orDisciples of St. John. All these sects have an immediate connection with oursubject, for they are of kabalistic parentage and have once held to the secret\"Wisdom Religion,\" recognizing as the One Supreme, the Mystery-God of theIneffable Name. Noticing these numerous secret societies of the past, we willbring them into direct comparison with several of the modern. We will concludewith a brief survey of the Jesuits, and of that venerable nightmare of the RomanCatholic Church--modern Freemasonry. All of these modern as well as ancientfraternities--present Freemasonry excepted--were and are more or less connectedwith magic--practically, as well as theoretically; and, every one ofthem--Freemasonry not excepted--was and still is accused of demonolatry,blasphemy, and licentiousness. Our object is not to write the history of either of them; but only to comparethese sorely-abused communities with the Christian sects, past and present, andthen, taking historical facts for our guidance, to defend the secret science aswell as the men who are its students and champions against any unjustimputation. One by one the tide of time engulfed the sects of the early centuries, until ofthe whole number only one survived in its primitive integrity. That one stillexists, still teaches the doctrine of its founder, still exemplifies its faithin works of power. The quicksands which swallowed up every other outgrowth ofthe religious agitation of the times of Jesus, with its records, relics, andtraditions, proved firm ground for this. Driven from their native land, itsmembers found refuge in Persia, and to-day the anxious traveller may conversewith the direct descendants of the \"Disciples of John,\" who listened, on theJordan's shore, to the \"man sent from God,\" and were baptized and believed. Thiscurious people, numbering 30,000 or more, are miscalled \"Christians of St.John,\" but in fact should be known by their old name of Nazareans, or their newone of Mendaeans. To term them Christians, is wholly unwarranted. They neither believe in Jesus asChrist, nor accept his atonement, nor adhere to his Church, nor revere its \"HolyScriptures.\" Neither do they worship the Jehovah-God of the Jews and Christians,a circumstance which of course proves that their founder, John the Baptist, didnot worship him either. And if not, what right has he to a place in the Bible,or in the portrait-gallery of Christian saints? Still further, if Ferho was hisGod, and he was \"a man sent by God,\" he must have been sent by Lord Ferho, andin his name baptized and preached? Now, if Jesus was baptized by John, theinference is that he was baptized according to his own faith; therefore, Jesustoo, was a believer in Ferho, or Faho, as they call him; a conclusion that seemsthe more warranted by his silence as to the name of his \"Father.\" And why shouldthe hypothesis that Faho is but one of the many corruptions of Fho or Fo, as theThibetans and Chinese call Buddha, appear ridiculous? In the North of Nepaul,Buddha is more often called Fo than Buddha. The Book of Mahawansa shows howearly the work of Buddhistic proselytism began in Nepaul; and history teachesthat Buddhist monks crowded into Syria *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu106.htm#fn_599] and Babylon in the centurypreceding our era, and that Buddhasp (Bodhisatva) the alleged Chaldean, was thefounder of Sabism or baptism. * What the actual Baptists, el-Mogtasila, or Nazareans, do believe, is fully setforth in other places, for they are the very Nazarenes of whom we have spoken somuch, and from whose Codex we have quoted. Persecuted and threatened withannihilation, they took refuge in the Nestorian body, and so allowed themselvesto be arbitrarily classed as Christians, but as soon as opportunity offered,they separated, and now, for several centuries have not even nominally deservedthe appellation. That they are, nevertheless, so called by ecclesiasticalwriters, is perhaps not very difficult to comprehend. They know too much ofearly Christianity to be left outside the pale, to bear witness against it withtheir traditions, without the stigma of heresy and backsliding being fastenedupon them to weaken confidence in what they might say. But where else can science find so good a field for biblical research as amongthis too neglected people? No doubt of their inheritance of the Baptist'sdoctrine; their traditions are without a break. What they teach now, theirforefathers taught at every epoch where they appear in history. They are thedisciples of that John who is said to have foretold the advent of Jesus,baptized him, and declared that the latchet of his shoe he (John) was not worthyto unloose. As they two--the Messenger and the Messiah--stood in the Jordan, andthe elder was consecrating the younger--his own cousin, too, humanlyspeaking--the heavens opened and God Himself, in the shape of a dove, descendedin a glory upon his \"Beloved Son\"! How then, if this tale be true, can weaccount for the strange infidelity which we find among these survivingNazareans? So far from believing Jesus the Only Begotten Son of God, theyactually told the Persian missionaries, who, in the seventeenth century, firstdiscovered them to Europeans, that the Christ of the New Testament was \"a falseteacher,\" and that the Jewish system, as well as that of Jesus (?), came fromthe realm of darkness! Who knows better than they? Where can more competentliving witnesses be found? Christian ecclesiastics would force upon us ananointed Saviour heralded by John, and the disciples of this very Baptist, fromthe earliest centuries, have stigmatized this ideal personage as an impostor,and his putative Father, Jehovah, \"a spurious God,\" the Ilda-Baoth of theOphites! Unlucky for Christianity will be the day when some fearless and honestscholar shall persuade their elders to let him translate the contents of theirsecret books and compile their hoary traditions! It is a strange delusion thatmakes some writers think that the Nazareans have no other sacred literature, noother literary relics than four doctrinal works, and that curious volume full ofastrology and magic which they are bound to peruse at the sunset hour, on everySol's day (Sunday). This search after truth leads us, indeed, into devious ways. Many are theobstacles that ecclesiastical cunning has placed in the way of our finding theprimal source of religious ideas. Christianity is on trial, and has been, eversince science felt strong enough to act as Public Prosecutor. A portion of thecase we are drafting in this book. What of truth is there in this Theology?Through what sects has it been transmitted? Whence was it primarily derived? Toanswer, we must trace the history of the World Religion, alike through thesecret Christian sects as through those of other great religious subdivisions ofthe race; for the Secret Doctrine is the Truth, and that religion is nearestdivine that has contained it with least adulteration. Our search takes us hither and thither, but never aimlessly do we bring sectswidely separated in chronological order, into critical juxtaposition. There isone purpose in our work to be kept constantly in view--the analysis of religiousbeliefs, and the definition of their descent from the past to the present. Whathas most blocked the way is Roman Catholicism; and not until the secretprinciples of this religion are uncovered can we comprehend the iron staff uponwhich it leans to steady its now tottering steps. We will begin with the Ophites, Nazareans, and the modern Druzes. The personalviews of the author, as they will be presented in the diagrams, will be mostdecidedly at variance with the prejudiced speculations of Irenaeus, Theodoret,and Epiphanius (the sainted renegade, who sold his brethren), inasmuch as theywill reflect the ideas of certain kabalists in close relations with themysterious Druzes of Mount Lebanon. The Syrian okhals, or Spiritualists, as theyare sometimes termed, are in possession of a great many ancient manuscripts andgems, bearing upon our present subject. The first scheme--that of the Ophites--from the very start, as we have shown,varies from the description given by the Fathers, inasmuch as it makes Bythos ordepth, a female emanation, and assigns her a place answering to that of Pleroma,only in a far superior region; whereas, the Fathers assure us that the Gnosticsgave the name of Bythos to the First Cause. As in the kabalistic system, itrepresents the boundless and infinite void within which is concealed in darknessthe Unknown Primal motor of all. It envelops HIM like a veil: in short werecognize again the \"Shekinah\" of the En-Soph. Alone, the name of ΙΑΟ, Iao,marks the upper centre, or rather the presumed spot where the Unknown One may besupposed to dwell. Around the Iao, runs the legend, ΚΕΜΕΚ ΕΙΛΑΜ ΑΒΡΑΣΑΧ. \"Theeternal Sun-Abrasax\" (the Central Spiritual Sun of all the kabalists,represented in some diagrams of the latter by the circle of Tiphereth). From this region of unfathomable Depth, issues forth a circle formed of spirals;which, in the language of symbolism, means a grand cycle, κυκλοσ, composed ofsmaller ones. Coiled within, so as to follow the spirals, lies theserpent--emblem of wisdom and eternity--the Dual Androgyne: the cyclerepresenting Ennoia or the Divine mind, and the Serpent--the Agathodaimon,Ophis--the Shadow of the Light. Both were the Logoi of the Ophites; or the unityas Logos manifesting itself as a double principle of good and evil; for,according to their views, these two principles are immutable, and existed fromall eternity, as they will ever continue to exist. This symbol accounts for the adoration by this sect of the Serpent, as theSaviour, coiled either around the Sacramental loaf or a Tau. As a unity, Ennoiaand Ophis are the Logos; when separated, one is the Tree of Life (Spiritual);the other, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Therefore, we find Ophisurging the first human couple--the material production of Ilda-Baoth, but whichowed its spiritual principle to Sophia-Achamoth--to eat of the forbidden fruit,although Ophis represents Divine Wisdom. The Serpent, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree of Life, areall symbols transplanted from the soil of India. The Arasa-Maram, the banyantree, so sacred with the Hindus, since Vishnu, during one of his incarnations,reposed under its mighty shade, and there taught humanity philosophy andsciences, is called the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life. Under theprotective umbrage of this king of the forests, the Gurus teach their pupilstheir first lessons on immortality and initiate them in the mysteries of lifeand death. The Java-ALEIM of the Sacerdotal College are said, in the Chaldeantradition, to have taught the sons of men to become like one of them. To thepresent day Foh-tchou, * who lives in his Foh-Maeyu, or temple of Buddha, on thetop of \"Kouin-long-sang,\" * the great mountain, produces his greatest religiousmiracles under a tree called in Chinese Sung-Ming-Shu, or the Tree of Knowledgeand the Tree of Life, for ignorance is death, and knowledge alone givesimmortality. This marvellous display takes place every three years, when animmense concourse of Chinese Buddhists assemble in pilgrimage at the holy place. Ilda-Baoth, the \"Son of Darkness,\" and the creator of the material world, wasmade to inhabit the planet Saturn, which identifies him still more with theJewish Jehovah, who was Saturn himself, according to the Ophites, and is by themdenied his Sinaitic name. From Ilda-Baoth emanate six spirits, who respectivelydwell with their father in the seven planets. These are Saba--or Mars;Adonai--Sol, or the Sun; ** Ievo--the Moon; Eloi--Jupiter; Astaphoi--Mercury(spirit of water); and Ouraios--Venus, spirit of fire. *** In their functions and description as given, these seven planets are identicalwith the Hindu Sapta-Loca, the seven places or spheres, or the superior andinferior worlds; for they represent the kabalistic seven spheres. With theOphites, they belong to the lower spheres. The monograms of these Gnosticplanets are also Buddhistic, the latter differing, albeit slightly, from thoseof the usual astrological \"houses.\" In the explanatory notes which accompany thediagram, the names of Cirenthius (the disciple of Simon Magus), of Menander, andof certain other Gnostics, whose names are not to be met with in the Patristicwritings, are often mentioned; such as Parcha (Ferho), for instance. ****[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu106.htm#fn_605] The author of the diagram claims, moreover, for his sect, the greatestantiquity, bringing forward, as a proof, that their \"forefathers\" were thebuilders of all the \"Dracontia\" temples, even of those beyond \"the greatwaters.\" He asserts that the \"Just One,\" who was the mouth-piece of the EternalAEon (Christos), himself sent his disciples into the world, placing them underthe double protection of Sige (Silence, the Logos), and Ophis, the Agathodaemon.The author alludes no doubt, to the favorite expression of Jesus, \"be wise asserpents, and harmless as doves.\" On the diagram, Ophis is represented as theEgyptian Cnuphis or Kneph, called Dracontiae. He appears as a serpent standingerect on its tail, with a lion's head, crowned and radiated, and bearing on thepoint of each ray one of the seven Greek vowels--symbol of the seven celestialspheres. This figure is quite familiar to those who are acquainted with theGnostic gems, * and is borrowed from the Egyptian Hermetic books. Thedescription given in the Revelation, of one \"like unto the Son of Man,\" with hisseven stars, and who is the Logos, is another form of Ophis. The Nazarene diagram, except in a change of names, is identical with that of theGnostics, who evidently borrowed their ideas from it, adding a few appellationsfrom the Basilidean and Valentinian systems. To avoid repetition, we will nowsimply present the two in parallel. Thus, we find that, in the Nazarene Cosmogony, the names of their powers andgenii stand in the following relations to those of the Gnostics: NAZARENE. First Trinity. Lord FERHO--the Life which is no Life--the Supreme God. The Cause which producesthe Light, or the Logos in abscondito. The water of Jordanus Maximus--the waterof Life, or Ajar, the feminine principle. Unity in a Trinity, enclosed withinthe ISH AMON. Second Trinity.(The manifestation of the first.) 1. Lord MANO--the King of Life and Light--Rex Lucis. First LIFE, or theprimitive man.2. Lord Jordan--manifestation or emanation of Jordan Maximus--the waters ofgrace. Second LIFE.3. The Superior Father--Abatur. Third LIFE. This Trinity produces also a duad--Lord Ledhoio, and Fetahil, the genius (theformer, a perfect emanation, the latter, imperfect). GNOSTIC-OPHITE. First Unity in a Trinity. IAO--the Ineffable Name of the Unknown Deity--Abraxas, and the \"EternalSpiritual Sun.\" Unity enclosed within the Depth, Bythos, feminine principle--theboundless circle, within which lie all ideal forms. From this Unity emanates the Second Trinity.(Idem.) 1. Ennoia--mind.2. Ophis, the Agathodaemon.3. Sophia Androgyne--wisdom; who, in her turn--fecundated with the DivineLight--produces Christos and Sophia-Achamoth (one perfect, the other imperfect), as anemanation. Lord Jordan--\"the Lord of all Jordans,\" manifests NETUBTO (Faith withoutWorks). * Sophia-Achamoth emanates Ilda-Baoth--the Demiurge, who produces material andsoulless creation. \"Works without Faith\" (or grace). * Moreover, the Ophite seven planetary genii, who emanated one from the other, arefound again in the Nazarene religion, under the name of the \"sevenimpostor-daemons,\" or stellars, who \"will deceive all the sons of Adam.\" Theseare Sol; Spiritus Venereus (Holy Spirit, in her material aspect), ** the motherof the \"seven badly-disposed stellars,\" answering to the Gnostic Achamoth; Nebu,or Mercury, \"a false Messiah, who will deprave the ancient worship of God\"; ***[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu106.htm#fn_609] SIN (or Luna, or Shuril);KIUN (Kivan, or Saturn); Bel-Jupiter; and the seventh, Nerig, Mars (CodexNazaraeus, p. 57). The Christos of the Gnostics is the chief of the seven AEons, St. John's sevenspirits of God; the Nazarenes have also their seven genii or good Eons, whosechief is Rex Lucis, MANO, their Christos. The Sapta Rishis, the seven sages ofIndia, inhabit the Sapta-Poura, or the seven celestial cities. What less or more do we find in the Universal Ecclesia, until the days of theReformation, and in the Roman Popish Church after the separation? We havecompared the relative value of the Hindu Cosmogony; the Chaldeo, Zoroastrian,Jewish Kabala; and that of the so-termed Haeretics. A correct diagram of theJudaico-CHRISTIAN religion, to enforce which on the heathen who have furnishedit, are expended such great sums every year, would still better prove theidentity of the two; but we lack space and are also spared the necessity ofproving what is already thoroughly demonstrated. In the Ophite gems of King (Gnostics), we find the name of Iao repeated, andoften confounded with that of Ievo, while the latter simply represents one ofthe genii antagonistic to Abraxas. In order that these names may not be taken asidentical with the name of the Jewish Jehovah we will at once explain this word.It seems to us surpassingly strange that so many learned archaeologists shouldhave so little insisted that there was more than one Jehovah, and disclaimedthat the name originated with Moses. Iao is certainly a title of the SupremeBeing, and belongs partially to the Ineffable Name; but it neither originatedwith nor was it the sole property of the Jews. Even if it had pleased Moses tobestow the name upon the tutelar \"Spirit,\" the alleged protector and nationaldeity of the \"Chosen people of Israel,\" there is yet no possible reason whyother nationalities should receive Him as the Highest and One-living God. But wedeny the assumption altogether. Besides, there is the fact that Yaho or Iao wasa \"mystery name\" from the beginning, [images/00024.jpg]and[images/00043.jpg]never came into use before King David. Anterior to his time,few or no proper names were compounded with iah or jah. It looks rather asthough David, being a sojourner among the Tyrians and Philistines (2 Samuel),brought thence the name of Jehovah. He made Zadok high-priest, from whom camethe Zadokites or Sadducees. He lived and ruled first at Hebron[images/00068.jpg], Habir-on or Kabeir-town, where the rites of the four(mystery-gods) were celebrated. Neither David nor Solomon recognized eitherMoses or the law of Moses. They aspired to build a temple to [images/00024.jpg],like the structures erected by Hiram to Hercules and Venus, Adon and Astarte. Says Furst: \"The very ancient name of God, Yaho, written in the Greek Ιαο,appears, apart from its derivation, to have been an old mystic name of theSupreme deity of the Shemites. (Hence it was told to Moses when initiated atHOR-EB--the cave, under the direction of Jethro, the Kenite or Cainite priest ofMidian.) In an old religion of the Chaldeans, whose remains are to be foundamongst the Neo-platonists, the highest divinity enthroned above the sevenheavens, representing the Spiritual Light-Principle (nous)* and also conceivedas Derniurgus, **was called Ιαο [images/00069.jpg], who was, like the HebrewYaho, mysterious and unmentionable, and whose name was communicated to theinitiated. The Phoenicians had a Supreme God whose name was trilateral andsecret, and he was Ιαο.\" *** But while Furst insists that the name has a Semitic origin, there are otherscholars who trace it farther than he does, and look back beyond theclassification of the Caucasians. In Sanscrit we have Jah and Jaya, or Jaa and Ja-ga, and this throws light on theorigin of the famous festival of the car of Jaga-nath, commonly calledJaggernath. Javhe means \"he who is,\" and Dr. Spiegel traces even the Persianname of God, \"Ahura,\" to the root ah, ****which in Sanscrit is pronounced as, tobreathe, and asu, became, therefore, in time, synonymous with \"Spirit.\" *Rawlinson strongly supports the opinion of an Aryan or Vedic influence on theearly Babylonian mythology. We have given, a few pages back, the strongestpossible proofs of the identity of Vishnu with Dag-on. The same may be adducedfor the title of Ιαο, and its Sanscrit root traced in every country. JU or Jovisis the oldest Latin name for God. \"As male he is Ju-piter, or Ju, the father,pitar being Sanscrit for father; as feminine, Ju-no or Ju, the comforter--[images/00070.jpg]being the Phoenician word for rest and comfort.\" **ProfessorMax Muller shows that although \"Dyaus,\" sky, does not occur as a masculine inthe ordinary Sanscrit, yet it does occur in the Veda, \"and thus bears witness tothe early Aryan worship of Dyaus, the Greek Zeus\" (The Veda). To grasp the real and primitive sense of the term ΙΑΟ, and the reason of itsbecoming the designation for the most mysterious of all deities, we must searchfor its origin in the figurative phraseology of all the primitive people. Wemust first of all go to the most ancient sources for our information. In one ofthe Books of Hermes, for instance, we find him saying that the number TEN is themother of the soul, and that the life and light are therein united. For \"thenumber 1 (one) is born from the spirit, and the number 10 (ten) frommatter\"; *** \"the unity has made the TEN, the TEN the unity.\" **** The kabalistic gematria--one of the methods for extracting the hidden meaningfrom letters, words, and sentences--is arithmetical. It consists in applying tothe letters of a word the sense they bear as numbers, in outward shape as wellas in their individual sense. Moreover, by the Themura (another method used bythe kabalists) any word could be made to yield its mystery out of its anagram.Thus, we find the author of Sepher Jezira saying, one or two centuries beforeour era: ***** \"ONE, the spirit of the Alahim of Lives.\" ****** So again, in theoldest kabalistic diagrams, the ten Sephiroth are represented as wheels orcircles, and Adam Kadmon, the primitive man, as an upright pillar. \"Wheels andseraphim and the holy creatures\" (chioth), says Rabbi Akiba. * In another systemof the same branch of the symbolical Kabala, called Athbach--which arranges theletters of the alphabet by pairs in three rows--all the couples in the first rowbear the numerical value ten; and in the system of Simeon Ben-Shetah, ** theuppermost couple--the most sacred of all, is preceded by the Pythagorean cipher,one and a nought, or zero--10. If we can once appreciate the fact that, among all the peoples of the highestantiquity, the most natural conception of the First Cause manifesting itself inits creatures, and that to this they could not but ascribe the creation of all,was that of an androgyne deity; that the male principle was considered thevivifying invisible spirit, and the female, mother nature; we shall be enabledto understand how that mysterious cause came at first to be represented (in thepicture-writings, perhaps) as the combination of the Alpha and Omega of numbers,a decimal, then as IAO, a trilateral name, containing in itself a deep allegory. IAO, in such a case, would--etymologically considered--mean the \"Breath ofLife,\" generated or springing forth between an upright male and an egg-shapedfemale principle of nature; for, in Sanscrit, as means \"to be,\" \"to live orexist\"; and originally it meant \"to breathe.\" \"From it,\" says Max Muller, \"inits original sense of breathing, the Hindus formed 'asu,' breath, and 'asura,'the name of God, whether it meant the breathing one or the giver of breath.\" ***It certainly meant the latter. In Hebrew, \"Ah\" and \"Iah\" mean life. CorneliusAgrippa, in his treatise on the Preeminence of Woman, shows that \"the word Evesuggests comparison with the mystic symbols of the kabalists, the name of thewoman having affinity with the ineffable Tetragrammaton, the most sacred name ofthe divinity.\" Ancient names were always consonant with the things theyrepresented. In relation to the mysterious name of the Deity in question, thehitherto inexplicable hint of the kabalists as to the efficacy of the letter H,\"which Abram took away from his wife Sarah\" and \"put into the middle of his ownname,\" becomes clear. It may perhaps be argued, by way of objection, that it is not ascertained as yetat what period of antiquity the nought occurs for the first time in Indianmanuscripts or inscriptions. Be that as it may, the case presents circumstantialevidence of too strong a character not to carry a conviction of probability withit. According to Max Muller \"the two words 'cipher' and 'zero,' which are inreality but one . . . are sufficient to prove that our figures are borrowed fromthe Arabs.\" *Cipher is the Arabic \"cifron,\" and means empty, a translation ofthe Sanscrit name of the nought \"synya,\" he says. The Arabs had their figuresfrom Hindustan, and never claimed the discovery for themselves. ** As to thePythagoreans, we need but turn to the ancient manuscripts of Boethius'sGeometry, composed in the sixth century, to find in the Pythagorean numerals ***the 1 and the nought, as the first and final cipher. And Porphyry, who quotesfrom the Pythagorean Moderatus, **** says that the numerals of Pythagoras were\"hieroglyphical symbols, by means whereof he explained ideas concerning thenature of things.\" Now, if the most ancient Indian manuscripts show as yet no trace of decimalnotation in them, Max Muller states very clearly that until now he has found butnine letters (the initials of the Sanscrit numerals) in them--on the other handwe have records as ancient to supply the wanted proof. We speak of thesculptures and the sacred imagery in the most ancient temples of the far East.Pythagoras derived his knowledge from India; and we find Professor Max Mullercorroborating this statement, at least so far as allowing the Neo-Pythagoreansto have been the first teachers of \"ciphering\" among the Greeks and Romans; that\"they, at Alexandria, or in Syria, became acquainted with the Indian figures,and adapted them to the Pythagorean abacus\" (our figures). This cautiousallowance implies that Pythagoras himself was acquainted with but nine figures.So that we might reasonably answer that although we possess no certain proofthat the decimal notation was known to Pythagoras, who lived on the very closeof the archaic ages, ***** we yet have sufficient evidence to show that the fullnumbers, as given by Boethius, were known to the Pythagoreans, even beforeAlexandria was built. ****** This evidence we find in Aristotle, who says that\"some philosophers hold that ideas and numbers are of the same nature, andamount to TEN in all.\" ******* This, we believe, will be sufficient to show thatthe decimal notation was known among them at least as early as four centuriesB.C., for Aristotle does not seem to treat the question as an innovation of the\"Neo-Pythagoreans.\" Besides, as we have remarked above, the representations of the archaic deities,on the walls of the temples, are of themselves quite suggestive enough. So, forinstance, Vishnu is represented in the Kurmavatara (his second avatar) as atortoise sustaining a circular pillar, on which the semblance of himself (Maya,or the illusion) sits with all his attributes. HEBREWS. While one hand holds a flower, another a club, the third a shell, the fourth,generally the upper one, or at the right--holds on his forefinger, extended asthe cipher 1, the chakra, or discus, which resembles a ring, or a wheel, andmight be taken for the nought. In his first avatar, the Matsyavatam, whenemerging from the fish's mouth, he is represented in the same position. *Theten-armed Durga of Bengal; the ten-headed Ravana, the giant; Parvati--as Durga,Indra, and Indrani, are found with this attribute, which is a perfectrepresentation of the May-pole. ** The holiest of the temples among the Hindus, are those of Jaggarnath. This deityis worshipped equally by all the sects of India, and Jaggarnath is named \"TheLord of the World.\" He is the god of the Mysteries, and his temples, which aremost numerous in Bengal, are all of a pyramidal form. There is no other deity which affords such a variety of etymologies as Iaho, nora name which can be so variously pronounced. It is only by associating it withthe Masoretic points that the later Rabbins succeeded in making Jehovah read\"Adonai\"--or Lord. Philo Byblus spells it in Greek letters ΙΕΥΟ--IEVO. Theodoretsays that the Samaritans pronounced it Iabe (Yahva) and the Jews Yaho; whichwould make it as we have shown I-ah-O. Diodorus states that \"among the Jews theyrelate that Moses called the God Ιαο.\" It is on the authority of the Bibleitself, therefore, that we maintain that before his initiation by Jethro, hisfather-in-law, Moses had never known the word Iaho. The future Deity of the sonsof Israel calls out from the burning bush and gives His name as \"I am that Iam,\" and specifies carefully that He is the \"Lord God of the Hebrews\" (Exod.iii. 18), not of the other nations. Judging him by his own acts, throughout theJewish records, we doubt whether Christ himself, had he appeared in the days ofthe Exodus, would have been welcomed by the irascible Sinaitic Deity. However,\"The Lord God,\" who becomes, on His own confession, Jehovah only in the 6thchapter of Exodus (verse 3) finds his veracity put to a startling test inGenesis xxii. 14, in which revealed passage Abraham builds an altar toJehovah-jireh. It would seem, therefore, but natural to make a difference between themystery-God Ιαο, adopted from the highest antiquity by all who participated inthe esoteric knowledge of the priests, and his phonetic counterparts, whom wefind treated with so little reverence by the Ophites and other Gnostics. Oncehaving burdened themselves like the Azazel of the wilderness with the sins andiniquities of the Jewish nation, it now appears hard for the Christians to haveto confess that those whom they thought fit to consider the \"chosen people\" ofGod--their sole predecessors in monotheism--were, till a very late period, asidolatrous and polytheistic as their neighbors. The shrewd Talmudists haveescaped the accusation for long centuries by screening themselves behind theMasoretic invention. But, as in everything else, truth was at last brought tolight. We know now that Ihoh [images/00024.jpg]must be read Iahoh and Iah, notJehovah. Iah of the Hebrews is plainly the Iacchos (Bacchus) of the Mysteries;the God \"from whom the liberation of souls was expected--Dionysus, Iacchos,Iahoh, Iah.\" *Aristotle then was right when he said: \"Joh [images/00024.jpg]wasOromasdes and Ahriman Pluto, for the God of heaven, Ahura-mazda, rides on achariot which the Horse of the Sun follows.\" **And Dunlap quotes Psalm lxviii.4, which reads: \"Praise him by his name Iach ( [images/00043.jpg]),Who rides upon the heavens, as on a horse,\"and then shows that \"the Arabs represented Iauk (Iach) by a horse. The Horse ofthe Sun (Dionysus).\" *** Iah is a softening of Iach, \"he explains.\"[images/00071.jpg]ch and [images/00072.jpg]h interchange; so s softens to h. TheHebrews express the idea of LIFE both by a ch and an h; as chiach, to be, hiah,to be; Iach, God of Life, Iah, \"I am.\" **** Well then may we repeat these linesof Ausonius: \"Ogugia calls me Bacchus; Egypt thinks me Osiris;The Musians name me Ph'anax; the Indi consider me Dionysus;The Roman Mysteries call me Liber; the Arabian race Adonis!\"And the chosen people Adoni and Jehovah--we may add. How little the philosophy of the old secret doctrine was understood, isillustrated in the atrocious persecutions of the Templars by the Church, and inthe accusation of their worshipping the Devil under the shape of thegoat--Baphomet! Without going into the old Masonic mysteries, there is not aMason--of those we mean who do know something--but has an idea of the truerelation that Baphomet bore to Azaze, the scapegoat of the wilderness, *****whose character and meaning are entirely perverted in the Christiantranslations. \"This terrible and venerable name of God,\" says Lanci, * librarianto the Vatican, \"through the pen of biblical glossers, has been a devil, amountain, a wilderness, and a he-goat.\" In Mackenzie's Royal MasonicCyclopaedia, the author very correctly remarks that \"this word should be dividedinto Azaz and El,\" for \"it signifies God of Victory, but is here used in thesense of author of Death, in contrast to Jehovah, the author of Life; the latterreceived a dead goat as an offering.\" ** The Hindu Trinity is composed of threepersonages, which are convertible into one. The Trimurti is one, and in itsabstraction indivisible, and yet we see a metaphysical division taking placefrom the first, and while Brahma, though collectively representing the three,remains behind the scenes, Vishnu is the Life-Giver, the Creator, and thePreserver, and Siva is the Destroyer, and the Death-giving deity. \"Death to theLife-Giver, life to the Death-dealer. The symbolical antithesis is grand andbeautiful,\" says Gliddon. *** \"Deus est Daemon inversus\" of the kabalists nowbecomes clear. It is but the intense and cruel desire to crush out the lastvestige of the old philosophies by perverting their meaning, for fear that theirown dogmas should not be rightly fathered on them, which impels the CatholicChurch to carry on such a systematic persecution in regard to Gnostics,Kabalists, and even the comparatively innocent Masons. Alas, alas! How little has the divine seed, scattered broadcast by the hand ofthe meek Judean philosopher, thrived or brought forth fruit. He, who himself had shunned hypocrisy, warned against public prayer, showingsuch contempt for any useless exhibition of the same, could he but cast hissorrowful glance on the earth, from the regions of eternal bliss, would see thatthis seed fell neither on sterile rock nor by the way-side. Nay, it took deeproot in the most prolific soil; one enriched even to plethora with lies andhuman gore! \"For, if the truth of God hath more abounded, through my lie unto his glory; whyyet am I also judged as a sinner?\" naively inquires Paul, the best and sincerestof all the apostles. And he then adds: \"Let us do evil, that good may come!\"(Romans iii. 7, 8). This is a confession which we are asked to believe as havingbeen a direct inspiration from God! It explains, if it does not excuse, themaxim adopted later by the Church that \"it is an act of virtue to deceive andlie, when by such means the interests of the Church might be promoted.\" **** Amaxim applied in its fullest sense by that accomplished professor in forgery,the Armenian Eusebius; or yet, that innocent-lookingbible-kaleidoscopist--Irenaeus. And these men were followed by a whole army ofpious assassins, who, in the meanwhile, had improved upon the system of deceit,by proclaiming that it was lawful even to kill, when by murder they couldenforce the new religion. Theophilus, \"that perpetual enemy of peace andvirtue,\" as the famous bishop was called; Cyril, Athanasius, the murderer ofArius, and a host of other canonized \"Saints,\" were all but too worthysuccessors of Saint Constantine, who drowned his wife in boiling water;butchered his little nephew; murdered, with his own pious hand, two of hisbrothers-in-law; killed his own son Crispus, bled to death several men andwomen, and smothered in a well an old monk. However, we are told by Eusebiusthat this Christian Emperor was rewarded by a vision of Christ himself, bearinghis cross, who instructed him to march to other triumphs, inasmuch as he wouldalways protect him! It is under the shade of the Imperial standard, with its famous sign, \"In hocsigno vinces,\" that \"visionary\" Christianity, which had crept on since the daysof Irenaenus, arrogantly proclaimed its rights in the full blaze of the sun. TheLabarum had most probably furnished the model for the true cross, which was\"miraculously,\" and agreeably to the Imperial will, found a few years later.Nothing short of such a remarkable vision, impiously doubted by some severecritics--Dr. Lardner for one--and a fresh miracle to match, could have resultedin the finding of a cross where there had never before been one. Still, we haveeither to believe the phenomenon or dispute it at the risk of being treated asinfidels; and this, notwithstanding that upon a careful computation we wouldfind that the fragments of the \"true Cross\" had multiplied themselves even moremiraculously than the five loaves in the invisible bakery, and the two fishes.In all cases like this, where miracles can be so conveniently called in, thereis no room for dull fact. History must step out that fiction may step in. If the alleged founder of the Christian religion is now, after the lapse ofnineteen centuries, preached--more or less unsuccessfully however--in everycorner of the globe, we are at liberty to think that the doctrines attributed tohim would astonish and dismay him more than any one else. A system of deliberatefalsification was adopted from the first. How determined Irenaeus was to crushtruth and build up a Church of his own on the mangled remains of the sevenprimitive churches mentioned in the Revelation, may be inferred from his quarrelwith Ptolemaeus. And this is again a case of evidence against which no blindfaith can prevail. Ecclesiastical history assures us that Christ's ministry wasbut of three years' duration. There is a decided discrepancy on this pointbetween the first three synoptics and the fourth gospel; but it was left forIrenaeus to show to Christian posterity that so early as A.D. 180--the probabletime when this Father wrote his works against heresies--even such pillars of theChurch as himself either knew nothing certain about it, or deliberately lied andfalsified dates to support their own views. So anxious was the worthy Father tomeet every possible objection against his plans, that no falsehood, nosophistry, was too much for him. How are we to understand the following; and whois the falsifier in this case? The argument of Ptolemaeus was that Jesus was tooyoung to have taught anything of much importance; adding that \"Christ preachedfor one year only, and then suffered in the twelfth month.\" In this Ptolemaeuswas very little at variance with the gospels. But Irenaeus, carried by hisobject far beyond the limits of prudence, from a mere discrepancy between oneand three years, makes it ten and even twenty years! \"Destroying his (Christ's)whole work, and robbing him of that age which is both necessary and morehonorable than any other; that more advanced age, I mean, during which also, asa teacher, he excelled all others.\" And then, having no certain data to furnish,he throws himself back on tradition, and claims that Christ had preached forover TEN years! (book ii., c. 22, pp. 4, 5). In another place he makes Jesusfifty years old. But we must proceed in our work of showing the various origins of Christianity,as also the sources from which Jesus derived his own ideas of God and humanity. The Koinobi lived in Egypt, where Jesus passed his early youth. They wereusually confounded with the Therapeutae, who were a branch of this widely-spreadsociety. Such is the opinion of Godfrey Higgins and De Rebold. After thedownfall of the principal sanctuaries, which had already begun in the days ofPlato, the many different sects, such as the Gymnosophists and the Magi--fromwhom Clearchus very erroneously derives the former--the Pythagoreans, the Sufis,and the Reshees of Kashmere, instituted a kind of international and universalFreemasonry, among their esoteric societies. \"These Rashees,\" says Higgins, \"arethe Essenians, Carmelites, or Nazarites of the temple.\" * \"That occult scienceknown by ancient priests under the name of regenerating fire,\" says FatherRebold, \" . . . a science that for more than 3,000 years was the peculiarpossession of the Indian and Egyptian priesthood, into the knowledge of whichMoses was initiated at Heliopolis, where he was educated; and Jesus among theEssenian priests of Egypt or Judea; and by which these two great reformers,particularly the latter, wrought many of the miracles mentioned in theScriptures.\" * Plato states that the mystic Magian religion, known under the name ofMachagistia, is the most uncorrupted form of worship in things divine. Later,the Mysteries of the Chaldean sanctuaries were added to it by one of theZoroasters and Darius Hystaspes. The latter completed and perfected it stillmore with the help of the knowledge obtained by him from the learned ascetics ofIndia, whose rites were identical with those of the initiated Magi. ** Ammian,in his history of Julian's Persian expedition, gives the story by stating thatone day Hystaspes, as he was boldly penetrating into the unknown regions ofUpper India, had come upon a certain wooded solitude, the tranquil recesses ofwhich were \"occupied by those exalted sages, the Brachmanes (or Shamans).Instructed by their teaching in the science of the motions of the world and ofthe heavenly bodies, and in pure religious rites . . . he transfused them intothe creed of the Magi. The latter, coupling these doctrines with their ownpeculiar science of foretelling the future, have handed down the whole throughtheir descendants to succeeding ages.\" *** It is from these descendants that theSufis, chiefly composed of Persians and Syrians, acquired their proficientknowledge in astrology, medicine, and the esoteric doctrine of the ages. \"TheSufi doctrine,\" says C. W. King, \"involved the grand idea of one universal creedwhich could be secretly held under any profession of an outward faith; and, infact, took virtually the same view of religious systems as that in which theancient philosophers had regarded such matters.\" **** The mysterious Druzes ofMount Lebanon are the descendants of all these. Solitary Copts, earnest studentsscattered hither and thither throughout the sandy solitudes of Egypt, Arabia,Petraea, Palestine, and the impenetrable forests of Abyssinia, though rarely metwith, may sometimes be seen. Many and various are the nationalities to whichbelong the disciples of that mysterious school, and many the side-shoots of thatone primitive stock. The secresy preserved by these sub-lodges, as well as bythe one and supreme great lodge, has ever been proportionate to the activity ofreligious persecutions; and now, in the face of the growing materialism, theirvery existence is becoming a mystery. * But it must not be inferred, on that account, that such a mysterious brotherhoodis but a fiction, not even a name, though it remains unknown to this day.Whether its affiliates are called by an Egyptian, Hindu, or Persian name, itmatters not. Persons belonging to one of these sub-brotherhoods have been met bytrustworthy, and not unknown persons, besides the present writer, who states afew facts concerning them, by the special permission of one who has a right togive it. In a recent and very valuable work on secret societies, K. R. H.Mackenzie's Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia, we find the learned author himself, anhonorary member of the Canongate Kilwinning Lodge, No. 2 (Scotland), and a Masonnot likely to be imposed upon, stating the following, under the head, HermeticBrothers of Egypt: \"An occult fraternity, which has endured from very ancient times, having ahierarchy of officers, secret signs, and passwords, and a peculiar method ofinstruction in science, religion, and philosophy. . . . If we may believe thosewho, at the present time, profess to belong to it, the philosopher's stone, theelixir of life, the art of invisibility, and the power of communication directlywith the ultramundane life, are parts of the inheritance they possess. Thewriter has met with only three persons who maintained the actual existence ofthis body of religious philosophers, and who hinted that they themselves wereactually members. There was no reason to doubt the good faith of theseindividuals--apparently unknown to each other, and men of moderate competence,blameless lives, austere manners, and almost ascetic in their habits. They all appeared to be men of forty to forty-five years of age, and evidentlyof vast erudition . . . their knowledge of languages not to be doubted. . . .They never remained long in any one country, but passed away without creatingnotice.\" * Another of such sub-brotherhoods is the sect of the Pitris, in India. Known byname, now that Jacolliot has brought it into public notice, it yet is morearcane, perhaps, than the brotherhood that Mr. Mackenzie names the \"HermeticBrothers.\" What Jacolliot learned of it, was from fragmentary manuscriptsdelivered to him by Brahmans, who had their reasons for doing so, we mustbelieve. The Agrouchada Parikshai gives certain details about the association,as it was in days of old, and, when explaining mystic rites and magicalincantations, explains nothing at all, so that the mystic L'om, L'Rhum, Sh'hrum,and Sho-rim Ramaya-Namaha, remain, for the mystified writer, as much a puzzle asever. To do him justice, though, he fully admits the fact, and does not enterupon useless speculations. Whoever desires to assure himself that there now exists a religion which hasbaffled, for centuries, the impudent inquisitiveness of missionaries, and thepersevering inquiry of science, let him violate, if he can, the seclusion of theSyrian Druzes. He will find them numbering over 80,000 warriors, scattered fromthe plain east of Damascus to the western coast. They covet no proselytes, shunnotoriety, keep friendly--as far as possible--with both Christians andMahometans, respect the religion of every other sect or people, but will neverdisclose their own secrets. Vainly do the missionaries stigmatize them asinfidels, idolaters, brigands, and thieves. Neither threat, bribe, nor any otherconsideration will induce a Druze to become a convert to dogmatic Christianity.We have heard of two in fifty years, and both have finished their careers inprison, for drunkenness and theft. They proved to be \"real Druzes,\" ** said oneof their chiefs, in discussing the subject. There never was a case of aninitiated Druze becoming a Christian. As to the uninitiated, they are neverallowed to even see the sacred writings, and none of them have the remotest ideawhere these are kept. There are missionaries in Syria who boast of having intheir possession a few copies. The volumes alleged to be the correct expositionsfrom these secret books (such as the translation by Petis de la Croix, in 1701,from the works presented by Nasr-Allah to the French king), are nothing morethan a compilation of \"secrets,\" known more or less to every inhabitant of thesouthern ranges of Lebanon and Anti-Libanus. They were the work of an apostateDervish, who was expelled from the sect Hanafi, for improper conduct--theembezzlement of the money of widows and orphans. The Expose de la Religion desDruzes, in two volumes, by Sylvestre de Sacy (1828), is another net-work ofhypotheses. A copy of this work was to be found, in 1870, on the window-sill ofone of their principal Holowey, or place of religious meeting. To theinquisitive question of an English traveller, as to their rites, the Okhal, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu106.htm#fn_649] a venerable old man, whospoke English as well as French, opened the volume of de Sacy, and, offering itto his interlocutor, remarked, with a benevolent smile: \"Read this instructiveand truthful book; I could explain to you neither better nor more correctly thesecrets of God and our blessed Hamsa, than it does.\" The traveller understoodthe hint. Mackenzie says they settled at Lebanon about the tenth century, and \"seem to bea mixture of Kurds, Mardi-Arabs, and other semi-civilized tribes. Their religionis compounded of Judaism, Christianity, and Mahometanism. They have a regularorder of priesthood and a kind of hierarchy . . . there is a regular system ofpasswords and signs. . . . Twelve month's probation, to which either sex isadmitted, preceded initiation.\" We quote the above only to show how little even persons as trustworthy as Mr.Mackenzie really know of these mystics. Mosheim, who knows as much, or we should rather say as little, as any others, isentitled to the merit of candidly admitting that \"their religion is peculiar tothemselves, and is involved in some mystery.\" We should say it was--rather! That their religion exhibits traces of Magianism and Gnosticism is natural, asthe whole of the Ophite esoteric philosophy is at the bottom of it. But thecharacteristic dogma of the Druzes is the absolute unity of God. He is theessence of life, and although incomprehensible and invisible, is to be knownthrough occasional manifestations in human form. * Like the Hindus they holdthat he was incarnated more than once on earth. Hamsa was the precursor of thelast manifestation to be (the tenth avatar) **not the inheritor of Hakem, who isyet to come. Hamsa was the personification of the \"Universal Wisdom.\" Bohaeddinin his writings calls him Messiah. The whole number of his disciples, or thosewho at different ages of the world have imparted wisdom to mankind, which thelatter as invariably have forgotten and rejected in course of time, is onehundred and sixty-four (164, the kabalistic s d k). Therefore, their stages ordegrees of promotion after initiation are five; the first three degrees aretypified by the \"three feet of the candlestick of the inner Sanctuary, whichholds the light of the five elements\"; the last two degrees, the most importantand terrifying in their solemn grandeur belonging to the highest orders; and thewhole five degrees emblematically represent the said five mystic Elements. The\"three feet are the holy Application, the Opening, and the Phantom,\" says one oftheir books; on man's inner and outer soul, and his body, a phantom, a passingshadow. The body, or matter, is also called the \"Rival,\" for \"he is the ministerof sin, the Devil ever creating dissensions between the Heavenly Intelligence(spirit) and the soul, which he tempts incessantly.\" Their ideas ontransmigration are Pythagorean and kabalistic. The spirit, or Temeami (thedivine soul), was in Elijah and John the Baptist; and the soul of Jesus was thatof H'amsa; that is to say, of the same degree of purity and sanctity. Untiltheir resurrection, by which they understand the day when the spiritual bodiesof men will be absorbed into God's own essence and being (the Nirvana of theHindus), the souls of men will keep their astral forms, except the few chosenones who, from the moment of their separation from their bodies, begin to existas pure spirits. The life of man they divide into soul, body, and intelligence,or mind. It is the latter which imparts and communicates to the soul the divinespark from its H'amsa (Christos). They have seven great commandments which are imparted equally to all theuninitiated; and yet, even these well-known articles of faith have been so mixedup in the accounts of outside writers, that, in one of the best Cyclopaedias ofAmerica (Appleton's), they are garbled after the fashion that may be seen in thecomparative tabulation below; the spurious and the true order parallel: CORRECT VERSION OF THE COMMANDMENTS AS IMPARTED ORALLY BY THE TEACHERS. * 1. The unity of God, or the infinite oneness of Deity. 2. The essential excellence of Truth. 3. Toleration; right given to all men and women to freely express their opinionson religious matters, and make the latter subservient to reason. 4. Respect to all men and women according to their character and conduct. 5. Entire submission to God's decrees. 6. Chastity of body, mind, and soul. 7. Mutual help under all conditions. GARBLED VERSION REPORTED BY THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES AND GIVEN IN PRETENDEDEXPOSITIONS. ** 1. (2) \" 'Truth in words,' meaning in practice, only truth to the religion andto the initiated; it is lawful to act and to speak falsehood to men of anothercreed.\" *** 2. (7) \"Mutual help, watchfulness, and protection.\" 3. (?) \"To renounce all other religions.\" **** 4. (?) \"To be separate from infidels of every kind, not externally but only inheart.\" ***** 5. (1) \"Recognize God's eternal unity.\" 6. (5) \"Satisfied with God's acts.\" 7. (5) \"Resigned to God's will.\" As will be seen, the only expose in the above is that of the great ignorance,perhaps malice, of the writers who, like Sylvestre de Sacy, undertake toenlighten the world upon matters concerning which they know nothing. \"Chastity, honesty, meekness, and mercy,\" are thus the four theological virtuesof all Druzes, besides several others demanded from the initiates: \"murder,theft, cruelty, covetousness, slander,\" the five sins, to which several othersins are added in the sacred tablets, but which we must abstain from giving. Themorality of the Druzes is strict and uncompromising. Nothing can tempt one ofthese Lebanon Unitarians to go astray from what he is taught to consider hisduty. Their ritual being unknown to outsiders, their would-be historians havehitherto denied them one. Their \"Thursday meetings\" are open to all, but nointerloper has ever participated in the rites of initiation which take placeoccasionally on Fridays in the greatest secresy. Women are admitted to them aswell as men, and they play a part of great importance at the initiation of men.The probation, unless some extraordinary exception is made, is long and severe.Once, in a certain period of time, a solemn ceremony takes place, during whichall the elders and the initiates of the highest two degrees start out for apilgrimage of several days to a certain place in the mountains. They meet withinthe safe precincts of a monastery said to have been erected during the earliesttimes of the Christian era. Outwardly one sees but old ruins of a once grandedifice, used, says the legend, by some Gnostic sects as a place of worshipduring the religious persecutions. The ruins above ground, however, are but aconvenient mask; the subterranean chapel, halls, and cells, covering an area ofground far greater than the upper building; while the richness of ornamentation,the beauty of the ancient sculptures, and the gold and silver vessels in thissacred resort, appear like \"a dream of glory,\" according to the expression of aninitiate. As the lamaseries of Mongolia and Thibet are visited upon grandoccasions by the holy shadow of \"Lord Buddha,\" so here, during the ceremonial,appears the resplendent ethereal form of Hamsa, the Blessed, which instructs thefaithful. The most extraordinary feats of what would be termed magic take placeduring the several nights that the convocation lasts; and one of the greatestmysteries--faithful copy of the past--is accomplished within the discreet bosomof our mother earth; not an echo, nor the faintest sound, not a glimmer of lightbetrays without the grand secret of the initiates. Hamsa, like Jesus, was a mortal man, and yet \"Hamsa\" and \"Christos\" aresynonymous terms as to their inner and hidden meaning. Both are symbols of theNous, the divine and higher soul of man--his spirit. The doctrine taught by theDruzes on that particular question of the duality of spiritual man, consistingof one soul mortal, and another immortal, is identical with that of theGnostics, the older Greek philosophers, and other initiates. Outside the East we have met one initiate (and only one), who, for some reasonsbest known to himself, does not make a secret of his initiation into theBrotherhood of Lebanon. It is the learned traveller and artist, Professor A. L.Rawson, of New York City. This gentleman has passed many years in the East, fourtimes visited Palestine, and has travelled to Mecca. It is safe to say that hehas a priceless store of facts about the beginnings of the Christian Church,which none but one who had had free access to repositories closed against theordinary traveller could have collected. Professor Rawson, with the truedevotion of a man of science, noted down every important discovery he made inthe Palestinian libraries, and every precious fact orally communicated to him bythe mystics he encountered, and some day they will see the light. He has mostobligingly sent us the following communication, which, as the reader willperceive, fully corroborates what is above written from our personal experienceabout the strange fraternity incorrectly styled the Druzes: \"34 BOND ST., NEW YORK, June 6, 1877.\". . . Your note, asking me to give you an account of my initiation into asecret order among the people commonly known as Druzes, in Mount Lebanon, wasreceived this morning. I took, as you are fully aware, an obligation at thattime to conceal within my own memory the greater part of the 'mysteries,' withthe most interesting parts of the 'instructions'; so that what is left may notbe of any service to the public. Such information as I can rightfully give, youare welcome to have and use as you may have occasion.\"The probation in my case was, by special dispensation, made one month, duringwhich time I was 'shadowed' by a priest, who served as my cook, guide,interpreter, and general servant, that he might be able to testify to the factof my having strictly conformed to the rules in diet, ablutions, and othermatters. He was also my instructor in the text of the ritual, which we recitedfrom time to time for practice, in dialogue or in song, as it may have been.Whenever we happened to be near a Druze village, on a Thursday, we attended the'open' meetings, where men and women assembled for instruction and worship, andto expose to the world generally their religious practices. I was never presentat a Friday 'close' meeting before my initiation, nor do I believe any one else,man or woman, ever was, except by collusion with a priest, and that is notprobable, for a false priest forfeits his life. The practical jokers among themsometimes 'fool' a too curious 'Frank' by a sham initiation, especially if sucha one is suspected of having some connection with the missionaries at Beirut orelsewhere.\"The initiates include both women and men, and the ceremonies are of so peculiara nature that both sexes are required to assist in the ritual and 'work.' The'furniture' of the 'prayer-house' and of the 'vision-chamber' is simple, andexcept for convenience may consist of but a strip of carpet. In the 'Gray Hall'(the place is never named, and is underground, not far from Bayt-ed-Deen) thereare some rich decorations and valuable pieces of ancient furniture, the work ofArab silversmiths five or six centuries ago, inscribed and dated. The day ofinitiation must be a continual fast from daylight to sunset in winter, or sixo'clock in summer, and the ceremony is from beginning to end a series of trialsand temptations, calculated to test the endurance of the candidate underphysical and mental pressure. It is seldom that any but the young man or womansucceeds in 'winning' all the 'prizes,' since nature will sometimes exert itselfin spite of the most stubborn will, and the neophyte fail of passing some of thetests. In such a case the probation is extended another year, when another trialis had.\"Among other tests of the neophyte's self-control are the following: Choicepieces of cooked meat, savory soup, pilau, and other appetizing dishes, withsherbet, coffee, wine, and water, are set, as if accidentally, in his way, andhe is left alone for a time with the tempting things. To a hungry and faintingsoul the trial is severe. But a more difficult ordeal is when the sevenpriestesses retire, all but one, the youngest and prettiest, and the door isclosed and barred on the outside, after warning the candidate that he will beleft to his 'reflections,' for half an hour. Wearied by the long-continuedceremonial, weak with hunger, parched with thirst, and a sweet reaction comingafter the tremendous strain to keep his animal nature in subjection, this momentof privacy and of temptation is brimful of peril. The beautiful young vestal,timidly approaching, and with glances which lend a double magnetic allurement toher words, begs him in low tones to 'bless her.' Woe to him if he does! Ahundred eyes see him from secret peep-holes, and only to the ignorant neophyteis there the appearance of concealment and opportunity.\"There is no infidelity, idolatry, or other really bad feature in the system.They have the relics of what was once a grand form of nature-worship, which hasbeen contracted under a despotism into a secret order, hidden from the light ofday, and exposed only in the smoky glare of a few burning lamps, in some dampcave or chapel under ground. The chief tenets of their religious teachings arecomprised in seven 'tablets,' which are these, to state them in general terms:\"1. The unity of God, or the infinite oneness of deity.\"2. The essential excellence of truth.\"3. The law of toleration as to all men and women in opinion.\"4. Respect for all men and women as to character and conduct.\"5. Entire submission to God's decrees as to fate.\"6. Chastity of body and mind and soul.\"7. Mutual help under all conditions.\"These tenets are not printed or written. Another set is printed or written tomislead the unwary, but with these we are not concerned.\"The chief results of the initiation seemed to be a kind of mental illusion orsleep-waking, in which the neophyte saw, or thought he saw, the images of peoplewho were known to be absent, and in some cases thousands of miles away. Ithought (or perhaps it was my mind at work) I saw friends and relatives that Iknew at the time were in New York State, while I was then in Lebanon. How theseresults were produced I cannot say. They appeared in a dark room, when the'guide' was talking, the 'company' singing in the next 'chamber,' and near theclose of the day, when I was tired out with fasting, walking, talking, singing,robing, unrobing, seeing a great many people in various conditions as to dressand undress, and with great mental strain in resisting certain physicalmanifestations that result from the appetites when they overcome the will, andin paying close attention to the passing scenes, hoping to remember them--sothat I may have been unfit to judge of any new and surprising phenomena, andmore especially of those apparently magical appearances which have alwaysexcited my suspicion and distrust. I know the various uses of the magic-lantern,and other apparatus, and took care to examine the room where the 'visions'appeared to me the same evening, and the next day, and several times afterwards,and knew that, in my case, there was no use made of any machinery or other meansbesides the voice of the 'guide and instructor.' On several occasions afterward,when at a great distance from the 'chamber,' the same or similar visions wereproduced, as, for instance, in Hornstein's Hotel at Jerusalem. A daughter-in-lawof a well-known Jewish merchant in Jerusalem is an initiated 'sister,' and canproduce the visions almost at will on any one who will live strictly accordingto the rules of the Order for a few weeks, more or less, according to theirnature, as gross or refined, etc.\"I am quite safe in saying that the initiation is so peculiar that it could notbe printed so as to instruct one who had not been 'worked' through the'chamber.' So it would be even more impossible to make an expose of them than ofthe Freemasons. The real secrets are acted and not spoken, and require severalinitiated persons to assist in the work.\"It is not necessary for me to say how some of the notions of that people seemto perpetuate certain beliefs of the ancient Greeks--as, for instance, the ideathat a man has two souls, and many others--for you probably were made familiarwith them in your passage through the 'upper' and 'lower chamber.' If I ammistaken in supposing you an 'initiate,' please excuse me. I am aware that theclosest friends often conceal that 'sacred secret' from each other; and evenhusband and wife may live--as I was informed in Dayr-el-Kamar was the fact inone family there--for twenty years together and yet neither know anything of theinitiation of the other. You, undoubtedly, have good reasons for keeping yourown counsel,\"Yours truly,\"A. L. RAWSON.\"Before we close the subject we may add that if a stranger ask for admission to a\"Thursday\" meeting he will never be refused. Only, if he is a Christian, theokhal will open a Bible and read from it; and if a Mahometan, he will hear a fewchapters of the Koran, and the ceremony will end with this. They will wait untilhe is gone, and then, shutting well the doors of their convent, take to theirown rites and books, passing for this purpose into their subterraneansanctuaries. \"The Druzes remain, even more than the Jews, a peculiar people,\"says Colonel Churchill, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu106.htm#fn_657]one of the few fair and strictly impartial writers. \"They marry within their ownrace; they are rarely if ever converted; they adhere tenaciously to theirtraditions, and they baffle all efforts to discover their cherished secrets. . .. The bad name of that caliph whom they claim as their founder is fairlycompensated by the pure lives of many whom they honor as saints, and by theheroism of their feudal leaders.\" And yet the Druzes may be said to belong to one of the least esoteric of secretsocieties. There are others far more powerful and learned, the existence ofwhich is not even suspected in Europe. There are many branches belonging to thegreat \"Mother Lodge\" which, mixed up with certain communities, may be termedsecret sects within other sects. One of them is the sect commonly known as thatof Laghana-Sastra. It reckons several thousand adepts who are scattered about insmall groups in the south of the Dekkan, India. In the popular superstition,this sect is dreaded on account of its great reputation for magic and sorcery.The Brahmans accuse its members of atheism and sacrilege, for none of them willconsent to recognize the authority of either the Vedas or Manu, except so far asthey conform to the versions in their possession, and which they maintain areprofessedly the only original texts; the Laghana-Sastra have neither temples norpriests, but, twice a month, every member of the community has to absent himselffrom home for three days. Popular rumor, originated among their women, ascribessuch absences to pilgrimages performed to their places of fortnightly resort. Insome secluded mountainous spots, unknown and inaccessible to other sects, hiddenfar from sight among the luxurious vegetation of India, they keep theirbungalows, which look like small fortresses, encircled as they are by lofty andthick walls. These, in their turn, are surrounded by the sacred trees calledassonata, and in Tamul arassa maram. These are the \"sacred groves,\" theoriginals of those of Egypt and Greece, whose initiates also built their templeswithin such \"groves\" inaccessible to the profane. * It will not be found without interest to see what Mr. John Yarker, Jr., has tosay on some modern secret societies among the Orientals. \"The nearestresemblance to the Brahmanical Mysteries, is probably found in the very ancient'Paths' of the Dervishes, which are usually governed by twelve officers, theoldest 'Court' superintending the others by right of seniority. Here the masterof the 'Court' is called 'Sheik,' and has his deputies, 'Caliphs,' orsuccessors, of which there may be many (as, for instance, in the brevet degreeof a Master Mason). The order is divided into at least four columns, pillars, ordegrees. The first step is that of 'Humanity,' which supposes attention to thewritten law, and 'annihilation in the Sheik.' The second is that of the 'Path,'in which the 'Murid,' or disciple, attains spiritual powers and'self-annihilation' into the 'Peer' or founder of the 'Path.' The third stage iscalled 'Knowledge,' and the 'Murid' is supposed to become inspired, called'annihilation into the Prophet.' The fourth stage leads him even to God, when hebecomes a part of the Deity and sees Him in all things. The first and secondstages have received modern subdivisions, as 'Integrity,' 'Virtue,''Temperance,' 'Benevolence.' After this the Sheik confers upon him the grade of'Caliph,' or Honorary Master, for in their mystical language, 'the man must diebefore the saint can be born.' It will be seen that this kind of mysticism isapplicable to Christ as founder of a 'Path.' \" To this statement, the author adds the following on the Bektash Dervishes, who\"often initiated the Janizaries. They wear a small marble cube spotted withblood. Their ceremony is as follows: Before reception a year's probation isrequired, during which false secrets are given to test the candidate; he has twogodfathers and is divested of all metals and even clothing; from the wool of asheep a cord is made for his neck, and a girdle for his loins; he is led intothe centre of a square room, presented as a slave, and seated upon a large stonewith twelve escallops; his arms are crossed upon his breast, his body inclinedforward, his right toes extended over his left foot; after various prayers he isplaced in a particular manner, with his hand in a peculiar way in that of theSheik, who repeats a verse from the Koran: 'Those who on giving thee their handswear to thee an oath, swear it to God, the hand of God is placed in their hand;whoever violates this oath, will do so to his hurt, and to whoever remainsfaithful God will give a magnificent reward.' Placing the hand below the chin istheir sign, perhaps in memory of their vow. All use the double triangles. TheBrahmans inscribe the angles with their trinity, and they possess also theMasonic sign of distress as used in France.\" * From the very day when the first mystic found the means of communication betweenthis world and the worlds of the invisible host, between the sphere of matterand that of pure spirit, he concluded that to abandon this mysterious science tothe profanation of the rabble was to lose it. An abuse of it might lead mankindto speedy destruction; it was like surrounding a group of children withexplosive batteries, and furnishing them with matches. The first self-made adeptinitiated but a select few, and kept silence with the multitudes. He recognizedhis God and felt the great Being within himself. The \"Atman,\" the Self, ** themighty Lord and Protector, once that man knew him as the \"I am,\" the \"Ego Sum,\"the \"Ahmi,\" showed his full power to him who could recognize the \"still smallvoice.\" From the days of the primitive man described by the first Vedic poet,down to our modern age, there has not been a philosopher worthy of that name,who did not carry in the silent sanctuary of his heart the grand and mysterioustruth. If initiated, he learnt it as a sacred science; if otherwise, then, likeSocrates repeating to himself, as well as to his fellow-men, the nobleinjunction, \"O man, know thyself,\" he succeeded in recognizing his God withinhimself. \"Ye are gods,\" the king-psalmist tells us, and we find Jesus remindingthe scribes that the expression, \"Ye are gods,\" was addressed to other mortalmen, claiming for himself the same privilege without any blasphemy. *And, as afaithful echo, Paul, while asserting that we are all \"the temple of the livingGod,\" ** cautiously adds, that after all these things are only for the \"wise,\"and it is \"unlawful\" to speak of them. Therefore, we must accept the reminder, and simply remark that even in thetortured and barbarous phraseology of the Codex Nazaraeus, we detect throughoutthe same idea. Like an undercurrent, rapid and clear, it runs without mixing itscrystalline purity with the muddy and heavy waves of dogmatism. We find it inthe Codex, as well as in the Vedas, in the Avesta, as in the Abhidharma, and inKapila's Sankhya Sutras not less than in the Fourth Gospel. We cannot attain the\"Kingdom of Heaven,\" unless we unite ourselves indissolubly with our Rex Lucis,the Lord of Splendor and of Light, our Immortal God. We must first conquerimmortality and \"take the Kingdom of Heaven by violence,\" offered to ourmaterial selves. \"The first man is of the earth earthy; the second man is fromheaven. . . . Behold, I show you a mystery,\" says Paul (1 Corinthians, xv. 47).In the religion of Sakya-Muni, which learned commentators have delighted so muchof late to set down as purely nihilistic, the doctrine of immortality is veryclearly defined, notwithstanding the European or rather Christian ideas aboutNirvana. In the sacred Jaina books, of Patuna, the dying Gautama-Buddha is thusaddressed: \"Arise into Nirvi (Nirvana) from this decrepit body into which thouhast been sent. Ascend into thy former abode, O blessed Avatar!\" This seems tous the very opposite of Nihilism. If Gautama is invited to reascend into his\"former abode,\" and this abode is Nirvana, then it is incontestable thatBuddhistic philosophy does not teach final annihilation. As Jesus is alleged tohave appeared to his disciples after death, so to the present day is Gautamabelieved to descend from Nirvana. And if he has an existence there, then thisstate cannot be a synonym for annihilation. Gautama, no less than all other great reformers, had a doctrine for his \"elect\"and another for the outside masses, though the main object of his reformconsisted in initiating all, so far as it was permissible and prudent to do,without distinction of castes or wealth, to the great truths hitherto kept sosecret by the selfish Brahmanical class. Gautama-Buddha it was whom we see thefirst in the world's history, moved by that generous feeling which locks thewhole humanity within one embrace, inviting the \"poor,\" the \"lame,\" and the\"blind\" to the King's festival table, from which he excluded those who hadhitherto sat alone, in haughty seclusion. It was he, who, with a bold hand,first opened the door of the sanctuary to the pariah, the fallen one, and allthose \"afflicted by men\" clothed in gold and purple, often far less worthy thanthe outcast to whom their finger was scornfully pointing. All this didSiddhartha six centuries before another reformer, as noble and as loving, thoughless favored by opportunity, in another land. If both, aware of the great dangerof furnishing an uncultivated populace with the double-edged weapon of knowledgewhich gives power, left the innermost corner of the sanctuary in the profoundestshade, who, that is acquainted with human nature, can blame them for it? Butwhile one was actuated by prudence, the other was forced into such a course.Gautama left the esoteric and most dangerous portion of the \"secret knowledge\"untouched, and lived to the ripe old age of eighty, with the certainty of havingtaught the essential truths, and having converted to them one-third of theworld; Jesus promised his disciples the knowledge which confers upon man thepower of producing far greater miracles than he ever did himself, and he died,leaving but a few faithful men, only half way to knowledge, to struggle with theworld to which they could impart but what they half-knew themselves. Later,their followers disfigured truth still more than they themselves had done. It is not true that Gautama never taught anything concerning a future life, orthat he denied the immortality of the soul. Ask any intelligent Buddhist hisideas on Nirvana, and he will unquestionably express himself, as the well-knownWong-Chin-Fu, the Chinese orator, now travelling in this country, did in arecent conversation with us about Niepang (Nirvana). \"This condition,\" heremarked, \"we all understand to mean a final reunion with God, coincident withthe perfection of the human spirit by its ultimate disembarrassment of matter.It is the very opposite of personal annihilation.\" Nirvana means the certitude of personal immortality in Spirit, not in Soul,which, as a finite emanation, must certainly disintegrate its particles acompound of human sensations, passions, and yearning for some objective kind ofexistence, before the immortal spirit of the Ego is quite freed, and henceforthsecure against further transmigration in any form. And how can man ever reachthis state so long as the Upadana, that state of longing for life, more life,does not disappear from the sentient being, from the Ahancara clothed, however,in a sublimated body? It is the \"Upadana\" or the intense desire which producesWILL, and it is will which develops force, and the latter generates matter, oran object having form. Thus the disembodied Ego, through this sole undyingdesire in him, unconsciously furnishes the conditions of his successiveself-procreations in various forms, which depend on his mental state and Karma,the good or bad deeds of his preceding existence, commonly called \"merit anddemerit.\" This is why the \"Master\" recommended to his mendicants the cultivationof the four degrees of Dhyana, the noble \"Path of the Four Truths,\" i.e., thatgradual acquirement of stoical indifference for either life or death; that stateof spiritual self-contemplation during which man utterly loses sight of hisphysical and dual individuality, composed of soul and body; and uniting himselfwith his third and higher immortal self the real and heavenly man merges, so tosay, into the divine Essence, whence his own spirit proceeded like a spark fromthe common hearth. Thus the Arhat, the holy mendicant, can reach Nirvana whileyet on earth; and his spirit, totally freed from the trammels of the \"psychical,terrestrial, devilish wisdom,\" as James calls it, and being in its own natureomniscient and omnipotent, can on earth, through the sole power of his thought,produce the greatest of phenomena. \"It is the missionaries in China and India, who first started this falsehoodabout Niepang, or Niepana (Nirvana),\" says Wong-Chin-Fu. Who can deny the truthof this accusation after reading the works of the Abbe Dubois, for instance? Amissionary who passes forty years of his life in India, and then writes that the\"Buddhists admit of no other God but the body of man, and have no other objectbut the satisfaction of their senses,\" utters an untruth which can be proved onthe testimony of the laws of the Talapoins of Siam and Birmah; laws, whichprevail unto this very day and which sentence a sahan, or punghi (a learned man;from the Sanscrit pundit), as well as a simple Talapoin, to death bydecapitation, for the crime of unchastity. No foreigner can be admitted intotheir Kyums, or Viharas (monasteries); and yet there are French writers,otherwise impartial and fair, who, speaking of the great severity of the rulesto which the Buddhist monks are subjected in these communities, and withoutpossessing one single fact to corroborate their skepticism, bluntly say, that\"notwithstanding the great laudations bestowed upon them (Talapoins) by certaintravellers, merely on the strength of appearances, I do not believe at all intheir chastity.\" * Fortunately for the Buddhist talapoins, lamas, sahans, upasampadas, ** and evensamenairas, *** they have popular records and facts for themselves, which areweightier than the unsupported personal opinion of a Frenchman, born in Catholiclands, whom we can hardly blame for having lost all faith in clerical virtue.When a Buddhist monk becomes guilty (which does not happen once in a century,perhaps) of criminal conversation, he has neither a congregation oftender-hearted members, whom he can move to tears by an eloquent confession ofhis guilt, nor a Jesus, on whose overburdened, long-suffering bosom are flung,as in a common Christian dust-box, all the impurities of the race. No Buddhisttransgressor can comfort himself with visions of a Vatican, within whosesin-encompassing walls black is turned into white, murderers into sinlesssaints, and golden or silvery lotions can be bought at the confessional tocleanse the tardy penitent of greater or lesser offenses against God and man. Except a few impartial archaeologists, who trace a direct Buddhistic element inGnosticism, as in all those early short-lived sects we know of very few authors,who, in writing upon primitive Christianity, have accorded to the question itsdue importance. Have we not facts enough to, at least, suggest some interest inthat direction? Do we not learn that, as early as in the days of Plato, therewere \"Brachmans\"--read Buddhist, Samaneans, Saman, or Shaman missionaries--inGreece, and that, at one time, they had overflowed the country? Does not Plinyshow them established on the shores of the Dead Sea, for \"thousands of ages\"?After making every necessary allowance for the exaggeration, we still haveseveral centuries B.C. left as a margin. And is it possible that their influenceshould not have left deeper traces in all these sects than is generally thought?We know that the Jaina sect claims Buddhism as derived from its tenets--thatBuddhism existed before Siddhartha, better known as Gautama-Buddha. The HinduBrahmans who, by the European Orientalists, are denied the right of knowinganything about their own country, or understanding their own language andrecords better than those who have never been in India, on the same principle asthe Jews are forbidden, by the Christian theologians, to interpret their ownScriptures--the Brahmans, we say, have authentic records. And these show theincarnation from the Virgin Avany of the first Buddha--divine light--as havingtaken place more than some thousands of years B.C., on the island of Ceylon. TheBrahmans reject the claim that it was an avatar of Vishnu, but admit theappearance of a reformer of Brahmanism at that time. The story of the VirginAvany and her divine son, Sakyamuni, is recorded in one of the sacred books ofthe Cinghalese Buddhists--the Nirdhasa; and the Brahmanic chronology fixes thegreat Buddhistic revolution and religious war, and the subsequent spread ofSakya-muni's doctrine in Thibet, China, Japan, and other places at 4,620 yearsB.C. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu106.htm#fn_666] It is clear that Gautama-Buddha, the son of the King of Kapilavastu, and thedescendant of the first Sakya, through his father, who was of the Kshatriya, orwarrior-caste, did not invent his philosophy. Philanthropist by nature, hisideas were developed and matured while under the tuition of Tir-thankara, thefamous guru of the Jaina sect. The latter claim the present Buddhism as adiverging branch of their own philosophy, and themselves, as the only followersof the first Buddha who were allowed to remain in India, after the expulsion ofall other Buddhists, probably because they had made a compromise, and admittedsome of the Brahmanic notions. It is, to say the least, curious, that threedissenting and inimical religions, like Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Jainism,should agree so perfectly in their traditions and chronology, as to Buddhism,and that our scientists should give a hearing but to their own unwarrantedspeculations and hypotheses. If the birth of Gautama may, with some show ofreason, be placed at about 600 B. C., then the preceding Buddhas ought to havesome place allowed them in chronology. The Buddhas are not gods, but simplyindividuals overshadowed by the spirit of Buddha--the divine ray. Or is itbecause, unable to extricate themselves from the difficulty by the help of theirown researches only, our Orientalists prefer to obliterate and deny the whole,rather than accord to the Hindus the right of knowing something of their ownreligion and history? Strange way of discovering truths! The common argument adduced against the Jaina claim, of having been the sourceof the restoration of ancient Buddhism, that the principal tenet of the latterreligion is opposed to the belief of the Jainas, is not a sound one. Buddhists,say our Orientalists, deny the existence of a Supreme Being; the Jainas admitone, but protest against the assumption that the \"He\" can ever interfere in theregulation of the universe. We have shown in the preceding chapter that theBuddhists do not deny any such thing. But if any disinterested scholar couldstudy carefully the Jaina literature, in their thousands of books preserved--orshall we say hidden--in Rajpootana, Jusselmere, at Patun, and other places; *and especially if he could but gain access to the oldest of their sacredvolumes, he would find a perfect identity of philosophical thought, if not ofpopular rites, between the Jainas and the Buddhists. The Adi-Buddha and Adinatha(or Adiswara) are identical in essence and purpose. And now, if we trace theJainas back, with their claims to the ownership of the oldest cave-temples(those superb specimens of Indian architecture and sculpture), and their recordsof an almost incredible antiquity, we can hardly refuse to view them in thelight which they claim for themselves. We must admit, that in all probabilitythey are the only true descendants of the primitive owners of old India,dispossessed by those conquering and mysterious hordes of white-skinned Brahmanswhom, in the twilight of history, we see appearing at the first as wanderers inthe valleys of Jumna and Ganges. The books of the Srawacs--the only descendantsof the Arhatas or earliest Jainas, the naked forest-hermits of the days of old,might throw some light, perhaps, on many a puzzling question. But will ourEuropean scholars, so long as they pursue their own policy, ever have access tothe right volumes? We have our doubts about this. Ask any trustworthy Hindu howthe missionaries have dealt with those manuscripts which unluckily fell intotheir hands, and then see if we can blame the natives for trying to save fromdesecration the \"gods of their fathers.\" To maintain their ground Irenaeus and his school had to fight hard with theGnostics. Such, also, was the lot of Eusebius, who found himself hopelesslyperplexed to know how the Essenes should be disposed of. The ways and customs ofJesus and his apostles exhibited too close a resemblance to this sect to allowthe fact to pass unexplained. Eusebius tried to make people believe that theEssenes were the first Christians. His efforts were thwarted by Philo Judaeus,who wrote his historical account of the Essenes and described them with theminutest care, long before there had appeared a single Christian in Palestine.But, if there were no Christians, there were Christians long before the era ofChristianity; and the Essenes belonged to the latter as well as to all otherinitiated brotherhoods, without even mentioning the Christnites of India.Lepsius shows that the word Nofre means Chrestos, \"good,\" and that one of thetitles of Osiris, \"Onnofre,\" must be translated \"the goodness of God mademanifest.\" * \"The worship of Christ was not universal at this early date,\"explains Mackenzie, \"by which I mean that Christolatry had not been introduced;but the worship of Chrestos--the Good Principle--had preceded it by manycenturies, and even survived the general adoption of Christianity, as shown onmonuments still in existence. . . . Again, we have an inscription which ispre-Christian on an epitaphial tablet (Spon. Misc. Erud., Ant., x. xviii. 2).Υα{! 0x63 c !}cηιντηε Λαρισαιον Δεμοσιε Εροσ {! 0x43 C !}Cηρεστε {! 0x43 C!}Cηαιρε, and de Rossi (Roma Sotteranea, tome i. tav. xxi.) gives us anotherexample from the catacombs--'AElia Chreste, in Pace.' \" ** And, Kris, asJacolliot shows, means in Sanscrit \"sacred.\" The meritorious stratagems of the trustworthy Eusebius thus proved lost labor.He was triumphantly detected by Basnage, who, says Gibbon, \"examined with theutmost critical accuracy the curious treatise of Philo, which describes theTherapeutae,\" and found that \"by proving it was composed as early as the time ofAugustus, he has demonstrated, in spite of Eusebius and a crowd of modernCatholics, that the Therapeutae were neither Christians nor monks.\" As a last word, the Christian Gnostics sprang into existence toward thebeginning of the second century, and just at the time when the Essenes mostmysteriously faded away, which indicated that they were the identical Essenes,and moreover pure Christists, viz.: they believed and were those who bestunderstood what one of their own brethren had preached. In insisting that theletter Iota, mentioned by Jesus in Matthew (v. 18), indicated a secret doctrinein relation to the ten aeons, it is sufficient to demonstrate to a kabalist thatJesus belonged to the Free-masonry of those days; for I, which is Iota in Greek,has other names in other languages; and is, as it was among the Gnostics ofthose days, a pass-word, meaning the SCEPTRE of the FATHER, in Easternbrotherhoods which exist to this very day. But in the early centuries these facts, if known, were purposely ignored, andnot only withheld from public notice as much as possible, but vehemently deniedwhenever the question was forced upon discussion. The denunciations of theFathers were rendered bitter in proportion to the truth of the claim which theyendeavored to refute. \"It comes to this,\" writes Irenaeus, complaining of the Gnostics, \"they neitherconsent to Scripture nor tradition.\" *And why should we wonder at that, wheneven the commentators of the nineteenth century, with nothing but fragments ofthe Gnostic manuscripts to compare with the voluminous writings of theircalumniators, have been enabled to detect fraud on nearly every page? How muchmore must the polished and learned Gnostics, with all their advantages ofpersonal observation and knowledge of fact, have realized the stupendous schemeof fraud that was being consummated before their very eyes! Why should theyaccuse Celsus of maintaining that their religion was all based on thespeculations of Plato, with the difference that his doctrines were far more pureand rational than theirs, when we find Sprengel, seventeen centuries later,writing the following?--\"Not only did they (the Christians) think to discoverthe dogmas of Plato in the books of Moses, but, moreover, they fancied that, byintroducing Platonism into Christianity, they would elevate the dignity of thisreligion and make it more popular among the nations.\" ** They introduced it so well, that not only was the Platonic philosophy selectedas a basis for the trinity, but even the legends and mythical stories which hadbeen current among the admirers of the great philosopher--as a time-honoredcustom required in the eyes of his posterity such an allegorical homage to everyhero worthy of deification--were revamped and used by the Christians. Withoutgoing so far as India, did they not have a ready model for the \"miraculousconception,\" in the legend about Periktione, Plato's mother? In her case it wasalso maintained by popular tradition that she had immaculately conceived him,and that the god Apollo was his father. Even the annunciation by an angel toJoseph \"in a dream,\" the Christians copied from the message of Apollo toAriston, Periktione's husband, that the child to be born from her was theoffspring of that god. So, too, Romulus was said to be the son of Mars, by thevirgin Rhea Sylvia. It is generally held by all the symbolical writers that the Ophites were foundguilty of practicing the most licentious rites during their religious meetings.The same accusation was brought against the Manichaeans, the Carpocratians, thePaulicians, the Albigenses--in short, against every Gnostic sect which had thetemerity to claim the right to think for itself. In our modern days, the 160American sects and the 125 sects of England are not so often troubled with suchaccusations; times are changed, and even the once all-powerful clergy have toeither bridle their tongues or prove their slanderous accusations. We have carefully looked over the works of such authors as Payne Knight, C. W.King, and Olshausen, which treat of our subject; we have reviewed the bulkyvolumes of Irenaeus, Tertullian, Sozomen, Theodoret; and in none but those ofEpiphanius have we found any accusation based upon direct evidence of aneye-witness. \"They say\"; \"Some say\"; \"We have heard\"--such are the general andindefinite terms used by the patristic accusers. Alone Epiphanius, whose worksare invariably referred to in all such cases, seems to chuckle with delightwhenever he couches a lance. We do not mean to take upon ourselves to defend thesects which inundated Europe at the eleventh century, and which brought to lightthe most wonderful creeds; we limit our defense merely to those Christian sectswhose theories were usually grouped under the generic name of Gnosticism. Theseare those which appeared immediately after the alleged crucifixion, and lastedtill they were nearly exterminated under the rigorous execution of theConstantinian law. The greatest guilt of these were their syncretistic views,for at no other period of the world's history had truth a poorer prospect oftriumph than in those days of forgery, lying, and deliberate falsification offacts. But before we are forced to believe the accusations, may we not be permitted toinquire into the historical characters of their accusers? Let us begin byasking, upon what ground does the Church of Rome build her claim of supremacyfor her doctrines over those of the Gnostics? Apostolic succession, undoubtedly.The succession traditionally instituted by the direct Apostle Peter. But what ifthis prove a fiction? Clearly, the whole superstructure supported upon this oneimaginary stilt would fall in a tremendous crash. And when we do inquirecarefully, we find that we must take the word of Irenaeus alone for it--ofIrenaeus, who did not furnish one single valid proof of the claim which he soaudaciously advanced, and who resorted for that to endless forgeries. He givesauthority neither for his dates nor his assertions. This Smyrniote worthy hasnot even the brutal but sincere faith of Tertullian, for he contradicts himselfat every step, and supports his claims solely on acute sophistry. Though he wasundoubtedly a man of the shrewdest intellect and great learning, he fears not,in some of his assertions and arguments, to even appear an idiot in the eyes ofposterity, so long as he can \"carry the situation.\" Twitted and cornered atevery step by his not less acute and learned adversaries, the Gnostics, heboldly shields himself behind blind faith, and in answer to their mercilesslogic falls upon imaginary tradition invented by himself. Reber wittily remarks:\"As we read his misapplications of words and sentences, we would conclude thathe was a lunatic if we did not know that he was something else.\" * So boldly mendacious does this \"holy Father\" prove himself in many instances,that he is even contradicted by Eusebius, more cautious if not more truthfulthan himself. He is driven to that necessity in the face of unimpeachableevidence. So, for instance, Irenaeus asserts that Papias, Bishop of Hierapolis,was a direct hearer of St. John; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu106.htm#fn_673] and Eusebius is compelledto show that Papias never pretended to such a claim, but simply stated that hehad received his doctrine from those who had known John. ** In one point, the Gnostics had the best of Irenaeus. They drove him, throughmere fear of inconsistency, to the recognition of their kabalistic doctrine ofatonement; unable to grasp it in its allegorical meaning, Irenaeus presented,with Christian theology as we find it in its present state of \"original sinversus Adam,\" a doctrine which would have filled Peter with pious horror if hehad been still alive. The next champion for the propagation of Apostolic Succession, is Eusebiushimself. Is the word of this Armenian Father any better than that of Irenaeus?Let us see what the most competent critics say of him. And before we turn tomodern critics at all, we might remind the reader of the scurrilous terms inwhich Eusebius is attacked by George Syncellus, the Vice-Patriarch ofConstantinople (eighth century), for his audacious falsification of the EgyptianChronology. The opinion of Socrates, an historian of the fifth century, is nomore flattering. He fearlessly charges Eusebius with perverting historicaldates, in order to please the Emperor Constantine. In his chronographic work,before proceeding to falsify the synchronistic tables himself, in order toimpart to Scriptural chronology a more trustworthy appearance, Syncellus coversEusebius with the choicest of monkish Billingsgate. Baron Bunsen has verifiedthe justness if not justified the politeness of this abusive reprehension. Hiselaborate researches in the rectification of the Egyptian List of Chronology, byManetho, led him to confess that throughout his work, the Bishop of Caesarea\"had undertaken, in a very unscrupulous and arbitrary spirit, to mutilatehistory.\" \"Eusebius,\" he says, \"is the originator of that systematic theory ofsynchronisms which has so often subsequently maimed and mutilated history in itsprocrustean bed.\" *** To this the author of the Intellectual Development ofEurope adds: \"Among those who have been the most guilty of this offense, thename of the celebrated Eusebius, the Bishop of Caesarea . . . should bedesignated!\" **** It will not be amiss to remind the reader that it is the same Eusebius who ischarged with the interpolation of the famous paragraph concerning Jesus, * whichwas so miraculously found, in his time, in the writings of Josephus, thesentence in question having till that time remained perfectly unknown. Renan, inhis Life of Jesus, expresses a contrary opinion. \"I believe,\" says he, \"thepassage respecting Jesus to be authentic. It is perfectly in the style ofJosephus; and, if this historian had made mention of Jesus, it is thus that hemust have spoken of him.\" Begging this eminent scholar's pardon, we must again contradict him. Layingaside his cautious \"if,\" we will merely show that though the short paragraph maypossibly be genuine, and \"perfectly in the style of Josephus,\" its severalparentheses are most palpably later forgeries; and \"if\" Josephus had made anymention of Christ at all, it is not thus that he would \"have spoken of him.\" Thewhole paragraph consists of but a few lines, and reads: \"At this time wasIasous, a 'WISE MAN,' ** if, at least, it is right to call him a man! (ανδρα)for he was a doer of surprising works, and a teacher of such men as receive 'thetruths' with pleasure. . . . This was the ANOINTED (!!). And, on an accusationby the first men among us, having been condemned by Pilate to the cross, theydid not stop loving him who loved them. For he appeared to them on the third dayalive, and the divine prophets having said these and many other wonderful thingsconcerning him.\" This paragraph (of sixteen lines in the original) has two unequivocal assertionsand one qualification. The latter is expressed in the following sentence: \"If,at least, it is right to call him a man.\" The unequivocal assertions arecontained in \"This is the ANOINTED,\" and in that Jesus \"appeared to them on thethird day alive.\" History shows us Josephus as a thorough, uncompromising,stiff-necked, orthodox Jew, though he wrote for \"the Pagans.\" It is well toobserve the false position in which these sentences would have placed atrue-born Jew, if they had really emanated from him. Their \"Messiah\" was thenand is still expected. The Messiah is the Anointed, and vice versa. And Josephusis made to admit that the \"first men\" among them have accused and crucifiedtheir Messiah and Anointed!! No need to comment any further upon such apreposterous incongruity, ***even though supported by so ripe a scholar asRenan. As to that patristic fire-brand, Tertullian, whom des Mousseaux apotheosizes incompany with his other demi-gods, he is regarded by Reuss, Baur, and Schweigler,in quite a different light. The untrustworthiness of statement and inaccuracy ofTertullian, says the author of Supernatural Religion, are often apparent. Reusscharacterizes his Christianism as \"apre, insolent, brutal, ferrailleur.\" It iswithout unction and without charity, sometimes even without loyalty, when hefinds himself confronted with opposition. \"If,\" remarks this author, \"in thesecond century all parties except certain Gnostics were intolerant, Tertullianwas the most intolerant of all!\" The work begun by the early Fathers was achieved by the sophomorical Augustine.His supra-transcendental speculations on the Trinity; his imaginary dialogueswith the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, and the disclosures and covertallusions about his ex-brethren, the Manicheans, have led the world to loadGnosticism with opprobrium, and have thrown into a deep shadow the insultedmajesty of the one God, worshipped in reverential silence by every \"heathen.\" And thus is it that the whole pyramid of Roman Catholic dogmas rests not uponProof, but upon assumption. The Gnostics had cornered the Fathers too cleverly,and the only salvation of the latter was a resort to forgery. For nearly fourcenturies, the great historians nearly cotemporary with Jesus had not taken theslightest notice either of his life or death. Christians wondered at such anunaccountable omission of what the Church considered the greatest events in theworld's history. Eusebius saved the battle of the day. Such are the men who haveslandered the Gnostics. The first and most unimportant sect we hear of is that of the Nicolaitans, ofwhom John, in the Apocalypse, makes the voice in his vision say that he hatestheir doctrine. *These Nicolaitans were the followers, however, of Nicolas ofAntioch, one of the \"seven\" chosen by the \"twelve\" to make distribution from thecommon fund to the proselytes at Jerusalem (Acts ii. 44, 45, vi. 1-5), hardlymore than a few weeks, or perhaps months, after the Crucifixion; ** and a man\"of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom\" (verse 3). Thus it wouldappear that the \"Holy Ghost and wisdom\" from on high, were no more a shieldagainst the accusation of \"haeresy\" than though they had never overshadowed the\"chosen ones\" of the apostles. It would be but too easy to detect what kind of heresy it was that offended,even had we not other and more authentic sources of information in thekabalistic writings. The accusation and the precise nature of the \"abomination\"are stated in the second chapter of the book of Revelation, verses 14, 15. Thesin was merely--marriage. John was a \"virgin\"; several of the Fathers assert thefact on the authority of tradition. Even Paul, the most liberal and high-mindedof them all, finds it difficult to reconcile the position of a married man withthat of a faithful servant of God. There is also \"a difference between a wifeand a virgin.\" * The latter cares \"for the things of the Lord,\" and the formeronly for \"how she may please her husband.\" \"If any man think that he behavethuncomely towards his virgin . . . let them marry. Nevertheless, he that standethsteadfast in his heart, and hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed .. . that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.\" So that he who marries \"doethwell . . . but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.\" \"Art thouloosed from a wife?\" he asks, \"seek not a wife\" (27). And remarking thataccording to his judgment, both will be happier if they do not marry, he adds,as a weighty conclusion: \"And I think also that I have the spirit of God\" (40).Far from this spirit of tolerance are the words of John. According to his visionthere are \"but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed fromthe earth,\" and \"these are they which were not defiled with women; for they werevirgins.\" ** This seems conclusive; for except Paul there is not one of theseprimitive Nazari, there \"set apart\" and vowed to God, who seemed to make a greatdifference between \"sin\" within the relationship of legal marriage, and the\"abomination\" of adultery. With such views and such narrow-mindedness, it was but natural that thesefanatics should have begun by casting this iniquity as a slur in the faces ofbrethren, and then \"bearing on progressively\" with their accusations. As we havealready shown, it is only Epiphanius whom we find giving such minute details asto the Masonic \"grips\" and other signs of recognition among the Gnostics. He hadonce belonged to their number, and therefore it was easy for him to furnishparticulars. Only how far the worthy Bishop is to be relied upon is a very gravequestion. One need fathom human nature but very superficially to find that thereseldom was yet a traitor, a renegade, who, in a moment of danger turned \"State'sevidence,\" who would not lie as remorselessly as he betrayed. Men never forgiveor relent toward those whom they injure. We hate our victims in proportion tothe harm we do them. This is a truth as old as the world. On the other hand, itis preposterous to believe that such persons as the Gnostics, who, according toGibbon, were the wealthiest, proudest, most polite, as well as the most learned\"of the Christian name,\" were guilty of the disgusting, libidinous actions ofwhich Epiphanius delights to accuse them. Were they even like that \"set oftatterde-malions, almost naked, with fierce looks,\" that Lucian describes asPaul's followers, * we would hesitate to believe such an infamous story. Howmuch less probable then that men who were Platonists, as well as Christians,should have ever been guilty of such preposterous rites. Payne Knight seems never to suspect the testimony of Epiphanius. He argues that\"if we make allowance for the willing exaggerations of religious hatred, andconsequent popular prejudice, the general conviction that these sectarians hadrites and practices of a licentious character appears too strong to be entirelydisregarded.\" If he draws an honest line of demarcation between the Gnostics ofthe first three centuries and those mediaeval sects whose doctrines \"ratherclosely resembled modern communism,\" we have nothing to say. Only, we would begevery critic to remember that if the Templars were accused of that most\"abominable crime\" of applying the \"holy kiss\" to the root of Baphomet'stail, **St. Augustine is also suspected, and on very good grounds, too, ofhaving allowed his community to go somewhat astray from the primitive way ofadministering the \"holy kiss\" at the feast of the Eucharist. The holy Bishopseems quite too anxious as to certain details of the ladies' toilet for the\"kiss\" to be of a strictly orthodox nature. *** Wherever there lurks a true andsincere religious feeling, there is no room for worldly details. Considering the extraordinary dislike exhibited from the first by Christians toall manner of cleanliness, we cannot enough wonder at such a strange solicitudeon the part of the holy Bishop for his female parishioners, unless, indeed, wehave to excuse it on the ground of a lingering reminiscence of Manichean rites! It would be hard, indeed, to blame any writer for entertaining such suspicionsof immorality as those above noticed, when the records of many historians are athand to help us to make an impartial investigation. \"Haeretics\" are accused ofcrimes in which the Church has more or less openly indulged even down to thebeginning of our century. In 1233 Pope Gregory IX. issued two bulls against theStedingers \"for various heathen and magical practices,\" **** and the latter, asa matter of course, were exterminated in the name of Christ and his Holy Mother.In 1282 a parish priest of Inverkeithing, named John, performed rites on Easterday by far worse than \"magical.\" Collecting a crowd of young girls, he forcedthem to enter into \"divine ecstasies\" and Bacchanalian fury, dancing the oldAmazonian circle-dance around the figure of the heathen \"god of the gardens.\"Notwithstanding that upon the complaint of some of his parishioners he was citedbefore his bishop, he retained his benefice because he proved that such was thecommon usage of the country. * The Waldenses, those \"earliest Protestants,\" wereaccused of the most unnatural horrors; burned, butchered, and exterminated forcalumnies heaped upon them by their accusers. Meanwhile the latter, in opentriumph, forming their heathen processions of \"Corpus Christi,\" with emblemsmodelled on those of Baal-Peor and \"Osiris,\" and every city in Southern Francecarrying, in yearly processions on Easter days, loaves and cakes fashioned likethe so-much-decried emblems of the Hindu Sivites and Vishnites, as late as1825! ** Deprived of their old means for slandering Christian sects whose religious viewsdiffer from their own, it is now the turn of the \"heathen,\" Hindus, Chinese, andJapanese, to share with the ancient religions the honor of having cast in theirteeth denunciations of their \"libidinous religions.\" Without going far for proofs of equal if not surpassing immorality, we wouldremind Roman Catholic writers of certain bas-reliefs on the doors of St. Peter'sCathedral. They are as brazen-faced as the door itself; but less so than anyauthor, who, knowing all this, feigns to ignore historical facts. A longsuccession of Popes have reposed their pastoral eyes upon these brazen picturesof the vilest obscenity, through those many centuries, without ever finding theslightest necessity for removing them. Quite the contrary; for we might namecertain Popes and Cardinals who made it a life-long study to copy these heathensuggestions of \"nature-gods,\" in practice as well as in theory. In Polish Podolia there was some years ago, in a Roman Catholic Church, a statueof Christ, in black marble. It was reputed to perform miracles on certain days,such as having its hair and beard grow in the sight of the public, and indulgingin other less innocent wonders. This show was finally prohibited by the RussianGovernment. When in 1585 the Protestants took Embrun (Department of the UpperAlps), they found in the churches of this town relics of such a character, that,as the Chronicle expresses it \"old Huguenot soldiers were seen to blush, severalweeks after, at the bare mention of the discovery.\" In a corner of the Church ofSt. Fiacre, near Monceaux, in France, there was--and it still is there, if wemistake not--a seat called \"the chair of St. Fiacre,\" which had the reputationof conferring fecundity upon barren women. A rock in the vicinity of Athens, notfar from the so-called \"Tomb of Socrates,\" is said to be possessed of the samevirtue. When, some twenty years since, the Queen Amelia, perhaps in a merrymoment, was said to have tried the experiment, there was no end of mostinsulting abuse heaped upon her, by a Catholic Padre, on his way through Syra tosome mission. The Queen, he declared, was a \"superstitious heretic!\" \" anabominable witch!\" \"Jezebel using magic arts.\" Much more the zealous missionarywould doubtless have added, had he not found himself, right in the middle of hisvituperations, landed in a pool of mud, outside the window. The virtuouselocutionist was forced to this unusual transit by the strong arm of a Greekofficer, who happened to enter the room at the right moment. There never was a great religious reform that was not pure at the beginning. Thefirst followers of Buddha, as well as the disciples of Jesus, were all men ofthe highest morality. The aversion felt by the reformers of all ages to viceunder any shape, is proved in the cases of Sakya-muni, Pythagoras, Plato, Jesus,St. Paul, Ammonius Sakkas. The great Gnostic leaders--if less successful--werenot less virtuous in practice nor less morally pure. Marcion, Basilides, *Valentinus, were renowned for their ascetic lives. The Nicolaitans, who, if theydid not belong to the great body of the Ophites, were numbered among the smallsects which were absorbed in it at the beginning of the second century, owetheir origin, as we have shown, to Nicolas of Antioch, \"a man of honest report,full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom.\" How absurd the idea that such men would haveinstituted \"libidinous rites.\" As well accuse Jesus of having promoted thesimilar rites which we find practiced so extensively by the mediaeval orthodoxChristians behind the secure shelter of monastic walls. If, however, we are asked to credit such an accusation against the Gnostics, anaccusation transferred with tenfold acrimony, centuries later, to theunfortunate heads of the Templars, why should we not believe the same of theorthodox Christians? Minucius Felix states that \"the first Christians wereaccused by the world of inducing, during the ceremony of the \"Perfect Passover,\"each neophyte, on his admission, to plunge a knife into an infant concealedunder a heap of flour; the body then serving for a banquet to the wholecongregation. After they had become the dominant party, they (the Christians)transferred this charge to their own dissenters.\" ** The real crime of heterodoxy is plainly stated by John in his Epistles andGospel. \"He that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . . . isa deceiver and an antichrist\" (2 Epistle 7). In his previous Epistle, he teacheshis flock that there are two trinities (7, 8)--in short, the Nazarene system. The inference to be drawn from all this is, that the made-up and dogmaticChristianity of the Constantinian period is simply an offspring of the numerousconflicting sects, half-castes themselves, born of Pagan parents. Each of thesecould claim representatives converted to the so-called orthodox body ofChristians. And, as every newly-born dogma had to be carried out by the majorityof votes, every sect colored the main substance with its own hue, till themoment when the emperor enforced this revealed olla-podrida, of which heevidently did not himself understand a word, upon an unwilling world as thereligion of Christ. Wearied in the vain attempt to sound this fathomless bog ofinternational speculations, unable to appreciate a religion based on the purespirituality of an ideal conception, Christendom gave itself up to the adorationof brutal force as represented by a Church backed up by Constantine. Since then,among the thousand rites, dogmas, and ceremonies copied from Paganism, theChurch can claim but one invention as thoroughly original with her--namely, thedoctrine of eternal damnation, and one custom, that of the anathema. The Pagansrejected both with horror. \"An execration is a fearful and grievous thing,\" saysPlutarch. \"Wherefore, the priestess at Athens was commended for refusing tocurse Alkibiades (for desecration of the Mysteries) when the people required herto do it; for, she said, that she was a priestess of prayers and not ofcurses.\" * \"Deep researches would show,\" says Renan, \"that nearly everything inChristianity is mere baggage brought from the Pagan Mysteries. The primitiveChristian worship is nothing but a mystery. The whole interior police of theChurch, the degrees of initiation, the command of silence, and a crowd ofphrases in the ecclesiastical language, have no other origin. . . . Therevolution which overthrew Paganism seems at first glance . . . an absoluterupture with the past . . . but the popular faith saved its most familiarsymbols from shipwreck. Christianity introduced, at first, so little change intothe habits of private and social life, that with great numbers in the fourth andfifth centuries it remains uncertain whether they were Pagans or Christians;many seem even to have pursued an irresolute course between the two worships.\"Speaking further of Art, which formed an essential part of the ancient religion,he says that \"it had to break with scarce one of its traditions. PrimitiveChristian art is really nothing but Pagan art in its decay, or in its lowerdepartments. The Good Shepherd of the catacombs in Rome is a copy from theAristeus, or from the Apollo Nomius, which figure in the same posture on thePagan sarcophagi, and still carries the flute of Pan in the midst of the fourhalf-naked seasons. On the Christian tombs of the Cemetery of St. Calixtus,Orpheus charms the animals. Elsewhere, the Christ as Jupiter-Pluto, and Mary asProserpina, receive the souls that Mercury, wearing the broad-brimmed hat andcarrying in his hand the rod of the soul-guide (psychopompos), brings to them,in presence of the three fates. Pegasus, the symbol of the apotheosis; Psyche,the symbol of the immortal soul; Heaven, personified by an old man, the riverJordan; and Victory, figure on a host of Christian monuments.\" As we have elsewhere shown, the primitive Christian community was composed ofsmall groups scattered about and organized in secret societies, with passwords,grips, and signs. To avoid the relentless persecutions of their enemies, theywere obliged to seek safety and hold meetings in deserted catacombs, thefastnesses of mountains, and other safe retreats. Like disabilities werenaturally encountered by each religious reform at its inception. From the veryfirst appearance of Jesus and his twelve disciples, we see them congregatingapart, having secure refuges in the wilderness, and among friends in Bethany,and elsewhere. Were Christianity not composed of \"secret communities,\" from thestart, history would have more facts to record of its founder and disciples thanit has. How little Jesus had impressed his personality upon his own century, iscalculated to astound the inquirer. Renan shows that Philo, who died toward theyear 50, and who was born many years earlier than Jesus, living all the while inPalestine while the \"glad tidings\" were being preached all over the country,according to the Gospels, had never heard of him! Josephus, the historian, whowas born three or four years after the death of Jesus, mentions his execution ina short sentence, and even those few words were altered \"by a Christian hand,\"says the author of the Life of Jesus. Writing at the close of the first century,when Paul, the learned propagandist, is said to have founded so many churches,and Peter is alleged to have established the apostolic succession, which theIrenaeo-Eusebian chronology shows to have already included three bishops ofRome, * Josephus, the painstaking enumerator and careful historian of even themost unimportant sects, entirely ignores the existence of a Christian sect.Suetonius, secretary of Adrian, writing in the first quarter of the secondcentury, knows so little of Jesus or his history as to say that the EmperorClaudius \"banished all the Jews, who were continually making disturbances, atthe instigation of one Crestus\" meaning Christ, we must suppose. * The EmperorAdrian himself, writing still later, was so little impressed with the tenets orimportance of the new sect, that in a letter to Servianus he shows that hebelieves the Christians to be worshippers of Serapis. ** \"In the secondcentury,\" says C. W. King, \"the syncretistic sects that had sprung up inAlexandria, the very hot-bed of Gnosticism, found out in Serapis a prophetictype of Christ as the Lord and Creator of all, and Judge of the living and thedead.\" *** Thus, while the \"Pagan\" philosophers had never viewed Serapis, orrather the abstract idea which was embodied in him, as otherwise than arepresentation of the Anima Mundi, the Christians anthropomorphized the \"Son ofGod\" and his \"Father,\" finding no better model for him than the idol of a Paganmyth! \"There can be no doubt,\" remarks the same author, \"that the head ofSerapis, marked, as the face is, by a grave and pensive majesty, supplied thefirst idea for the conventional portraits of the Saviour.\" **** In the notes taken by a traveller--whose episode with the monks on Mount Athoswe have mentioned elsewhere--we find that, during his early life, Jesus hadfrequent intercourse with the Essenes belonging to the Pythagorean school, andknown as the Koinobi. We believe it rather hazardous on the part of Renan toassert so dogmatically, as he does, that Jesus \"ignored the very name of Buddha,of Zoroaster, of Plato\"; that he had never read a Greek nor a Buddhistic book,\"although he had more than one element in him, which, unawares to himself,proceeded from Buddhism, Parsism, and the Greek wisdom.\" ***** This is concedinghalf a miracle, and allowing as much to chance and coincidence. It is an abuseof privilege, when an author, who claims to write historical facts, drawsconvenient deductions from hypothetical premises, and then calls it abiography--a Life of Jesus. No more than any other compiler of legendsconcerning the problematical history of the Nazarene prophet, has Renan one inchof secure foothold upon which to maintain himself; nor can any one else assert aclaim to the contrary, except on inferential evidence. And yet, while Renan hasnot one solitary fact to show that Jesus had never studied the metaphysicaltenets of Buddhism and Parsism, or heard of the philosophy of Plato, hisopponents have the best reasons in the world to suspect the contrary. When theyfind that--1, all his sayings are in a Pythagorean spirit, when not verbatimrepetitions; 2, his code of ethics is purely Buddhistic; 3, his mode of actionand walk in life, Essenean; and 4, his mystical mode of expression, hisparables, and his ways, those of an initiate, whether Grecian, Chaldean, or,Magian (for the \"Perfect,\" who spoke the hidden wisdom, were of the same schoolof archaic learning the world over), it is difficult to escape from the logicalconclusion that he belonged to that same body of initiates. It is a poorcompliment paid the Supreme, this forcing upon Him four gospels, in which,contradictory as they often are, there is not a single narrative, sentence, orpeculiar expression, whose parallel may not be found in some older doctrine orphilosophy. Surely, the Almighty--were it but to spare future generations theirpresent perplexity--might have brought down with Him, at His first and onlyincarnation on earth, something original--something that would trace a distinctline of demarcation between Himself and the score or so of incarnate Pagan gods,who had been born of virgins, had all been saviours, and were either killed, orotherwise sacrificed themselves for humanity. Too much has already been conceded to the emotional side of the story. What theworld needs is a less exalted, but more faithful view of a personage, in whosefavor nearly half of Christendom has dethroned the Almighty. It is not theerudite, world-famous scholar, whom we question for what we find in his Vie deJesus, nor is it one of his historical statements. We simply challenge a fewunwarranted and untenable assertions that have found their way past theemotional narrator, into the otherwise beautiful pages of the work--a life builtaltogether on mere probabilities, and yet that of one who, if accepted as anhistorical personage, has far greater claims upon our love and veneration,fallible as he is with all his greatness, than if we figure him as an omnipotentGod. It is but in the latter character that Jesus must be regarded by everyreverential mind as a failure. Notwithstanding the paucity of old philosophical works now extant, we could findno end of instances of perfect identity between Pythagorean, Hindu, and NewTestament sayings. There is no lack of proofs upon this point. What is needed isa Christian public that will examine what will be offered, and show commonhonesty in rendering its verdict. Bigotry has had its day, and done its worst.\"We need not be frightened,\" says Professor Muller, \"if we discover traces oftruth, traces even of Christian truth, among the sages and lawgivers of othernations.\" After reading the following philosophical aphorisms, who can believe that Jesusand Paul had never read the Grecian and Indian philosophers? SENTENCES FROM SEXTUS, THE PYTHAGOREAN, AND OTHER HEATHEN. 1. \"Possess not treasures, but those things which no one can take from you.\" 2. \"It is better for a part of the body which contains purulent matter, andthreatens to infect the whole, to be burnt, than to continue so in another state(life).\" 3. \"You have in yourself something similar to God, and therefore use yourself asthe temple of God.\" 4. \"The greatest honor which can be paid to God, is to know and imitate hisperfection.\" 5. \"What I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men\" (Analectsof Confucius, p. 76; See Max Muller's The Works of Confucius). 6. \"The moon shines even in the house of the wicked\" (Manu). 7. \"They who give, have things given to them; those who withhold, have thingstaken from them\" (Ibid.). 8. \"Purity of mind alone sees God\" (Ibid.)--still a popular saying in India. VERSES FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu106.htm#fn_699] 1. \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust dothcorrupt, and where thieves break through and steal\" (Matthew vi. 19). 2. \"And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter untolife maimed, than go to hell,\" etc. (Mark ix. 43). 3. \"Know ye not ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth inyou?\" (1 Corinthians, iii. 16). 4. \"That ye may be the children of your Father, which is in Heaven, be yeperfect even as your Father is perfect\" (Matthew v. 45-48). 5. \"Do ye unto others as ye would that others should do to you.\" 6. \"He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain onthe just and on the unjust\" (Matthew v. 45). 7. \"Whosoever hath, to him shall be given . . . but whosoever hath not, from himshall be taken away\" (Matthew xiii. 12). 8. \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God\" (Matthew v. 8). Plato did not conceal the fact that he derived his best philosophical doctrinesfrom Pythagoras, and that himself was merely the first to reduce them tosystematic order, occasionally interweaving with them metaphysical speculationsof his own. But Pythagoras himself got his recondite doctrines, first from thedescendants of Mochus, and later, from the Brahmans of India. He was alsoinitiated into the Mysteries among the hierophants of Thebes, the Persian andChaldean Magi. Thus, step by step do we trace the origin of most of ourChristian doctrines to Middle Asia. Drop out from Christianity the personalityof Jesus, so sublime, because of its unparalleled simplicity, and what remains?History and comparative theology echo back the melancholy answer, \"A crumblingskeleton formed of the oldest Pagan myths!\" While the mythical birth and life of Jesus are a faithful copy of those of theBrahmanical Christna, his historical character of a religious reformer inPalestine is the true type of Buddha in India. In more than one respect theirgreat resemblance in philanthropic and spiritual aspirations, as well asexternal circumstances is truly striking. Though the son of a king, while Jesuswas but a carpenter, Buddha was not of the high Brahmanical caste by birth. LikeJesus, he felt dissatisfied with the dogmatic spirit of the religion of hiscountry, the intolerance and hypocrisy of the priesthood, their outward show ofdevotion, and their useless ceremonials and prayers. As Buddha broke violentlythrough the traditional laws and rules of the Brahmans, so did Jesus declare waragainst the Pharisees, and the proud Sadducees. What the Nazarene did as aconsequence of his humble birth and position, Buddha did as a voluntary penance.He travelled about as a beggar; and--again like Jesus--later in life he soughtby preference the companionship of publicans and sinners. Each aimed at a socialas well as at a religious reform; and giving a death-blow to the old religionsof his countries, each became the founder of a new one. \"The reform of Buddha,\" says Max Muller, \"had originally much more of a socialthan of a religious character. The most important element of Buddhist reform hasalways been its social and moral code, not its metaphysical theories. That moralcode is one of the most perfect which the world has ever known . . . and hewhose meditations had been how to deliver the soul of man from misery and thefear of death, had delivered the people of India from a degrading thraldom andfrom priestly tyranny.\" Further, the lecturer adds that were it otherwise,\"Buddha might have taught whatever philosophy he pleased, and we should hardlyhave heard his name. The people would not have minded him, and his system wouldonly have been a drop in the ocean of philosophic speculation by which India wasdeluged at all times.\" * The same with Jesus. While Philo, whom Renan calls Jesus's elder brother,Hillel, Shammai, and Gamaliel, are hardly mentioned--Jesus has become a God! Andstill, pure and divine as was the moral code taught by Christ, it never couldhave borne comparison with that of Buddha, but for the tragedy of Calvary. Thatwhich helped forward the deification of Jesus was his dramatic death, thevoluntary sacrifice of his life, alleged to have been made for the sake ofmankind, and the later convenient dogma of the atonement, invented by theChristians. In India, where life is valued as of no account, the crucifixionwould have produced little effect, if any. In a country where--as all theIndianists are well aware--religious fanatics set themselves to dying by inches,in penances lasting for years; where the most fearful macerations areself-inflicted by fakirs; where young and delicate widows, in a spirit ofbravado against the government, as much as out of religious fanaticism, mountthe funeral pile with a smile on their face; where, to quote the words of thegreat lecturer, \"Men in the prime of life throw themselves under the car ofJuggernath, to be crushed to death by the idol they believe in; where theplaintiff who cannot get redress starves himself to death at the door of hisjudge; where the philosopher who thinks he has learned all which this world canteach him, and who longs for absorption into the Deity, quietly steps into theGanges, in order to arrive at the other shore of existence,\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu106.htm#fn_701] in such a country even avoluntary crucifixion would have passed unnoticed. In Judea, and even amongbraver nations than the Jews--the Romans and the Greeks--where every one clungmore or less to life, and most people would have fought for it with desperation,the tragical end of the great Reformer was calculated to produce a profoundimpression. The names of even such minor heroes as Mutius Scaevola, HoratiusCocles, the mother of the Gracchi, and others, have descended to posterity; and,during our school-days, as well as later in life, their histories have awakenedour sympathy and commanded a reverential admiration. But, can we ever forget thescornful smile of certain Hindus, at Benares, when an English lady, the wife ofa clergyman, tried to impress them with the greatness of the sacrifice of Jesus,in giving his life for us? Then, for the first time the idea struck us how muchthe pathos of the great drama of Calvary had to do with subsequent events in thefoundation of Christianity. Even the imaginative Renan was moved by this feelingto write in the last chapter of his Vie de Jesus, a few pages of singular andsympathetic beauty. ** Apollonius, a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth, was, like him, an enthusiasticfounder of a new spiritual school. Perhaps less metaphysical and more practicalthan Jesus, less tender and perfect in his nature, he nevertheless inculcatedthe same quintessence of spirituality, and the same high moral truths. His greatmistake was to confine them too closely to the higher classes of society. Whileto the poor and the humble Jesus preached \"Peace on earth and good will to men,\"Apollonius was the friend of kings, and moved with the aristocracy. He was bornamong the latter, and himself a man of wealth, while the \"Son of man,\"representing the people, \"had not where to lay his head\"; nevertheless, the two\"miracle-workers\" exhibited striking similarity of purpose. Still earlier thanApollonius had appeared Simon Magus, called \"the great Power of God.\" His\"miracles\" are both more wonderful, more varied, and better attested than thoseeither of the apostles or of the Galilean philosopher himself. Materialismdenies the fact in both cases, but history affirms. Apollonius followed both;and how great and renowned were his miraculous works in comparison with those ofthe alleged founder of Christianity as the kabalists claim, we have historyagain, and Justin Martyr, to corroborate. * Like Buddha and Jesus, Apollonius was the uncompromising enemy of all outwardshow of piety, all display of useless religious ceremonies and hypocrisy. If,like the Christian Saviour, the sage of Tyana had by preference sought thecompanionship of the poor and humble; and if instead of dying comfortably, atover one hundred years of age, he had been a voluntary martyr, proclaimingdivine Truth from a cross, ** his blood might have proved as efficacious for thesubsequent dissemination of spiritual doctrines as that of the ChristianMessiah. The calumnies set afloat against Apollonius, were as numerous as they werefalse. So late as eighteen centuries after his death he was defamed by BishopDouglas in his work against miracles. In this the Right Reverend bishop crushedhimself against historical facts. If we study the question with a dispassionatemind, we will soon perceive that the ethics of Gautama-Buddha, Plato,Apollonius, Jesus, Ammonius Sakkas, and his disciples, were all based on thesame mystic philosophy. That all worshipped one God, whether they considered Himas the \"Father\" of humanity, who lives in man as man lives in Him, or as theIncomprehensible Creative Principle; all led God-like lives. Ammonius, speakingof his philosophy, taught that their school dated from the days of Hermes, whobrought his wisdom from India. It was the same mystical contemplationthroughout, as that of the Yogin: the communion of the Brahman with his ownluminous Self--the \"Atman.\" And this Hindu term is again kabalistic, parexcellence. Who is \"Self\"? is asked in the Rig-Veda; \"Self is the Lord of allthings . . . all things are contained in this Self; all selves are contained inthis Self. Brahman itself is but Self,\" * is the answer. Says Idra Rabba: \"Allthings are Himself, and Himself is concealed on every side.\" ** The \"Adam Kadmonof the kabalists contains in himself all the souls of the Israelites, and he ishimself in every soul,\" says the Sohar. *** The groundwork of the EclecticSchool was thus identical with the doctrines of the Yogin, the Hindu mystics,and the earlier Buddhism of the disciples of Gautama. And when Jesus assured hisdisciples that \"the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive because itseeth Him not, neither knoweth Him,\" dwells with and in them, who \"are in Himand He in them,\" * he but expounded the same tenet that we find running throughevery philosophy worthy of that name. Laboulaye, the learned and skeptical French savant, does not believe a word ofthe miraculous portion of Buddha's life; nevertheless, he has the candor tospeak of Gautama as being only second to Christ in the great purity of hisethics and personal morality. For both of these opinions he is respectfullyrebuked by des Mousseaux. Vexed at this scientific contradiction of hisaccusations of demonolatry against Gautama-Buddha, he assures his readers that\"ce savant distingue n'a point etudie cette question.\" ** \"I do not hesitate to say,\" remarks in his turn Barthelemy St. Hilaire, \"that,except Christ alone, there is not among the founders of religions, a figureeither more pure or more touching than that of Buddha. His life is spotless. Hisconstant heroism equals his convictions. . . . He is the perfect model of allthe virtues he preaches; his abnegation, his charity, his unalterable sweetnessof disposition, do not fail him for one instant. He abandoned, at the age oftwenty-nine, his father's court to become a monk and a beggar . . . and when hedies in the arms of his disciples, it is with the serenity of a sage whopracticed virtue all his life, and who dies convinced of having found thetruth.\" *** This deserved panegyric is no stronger than the one which Laboulayehimself pronounced, and which occasioned des Mousseaux's wrath. \"It is more thandifficult,\" adds the former, \"to understand how men not assisted by revelationcould have soared so high and approached so near the truth.\" **** Curious thatthere should be so many lofty souls \"not assisted by revelation\"! And why should any one feel surprised that Gautmna could die with philosophicalserenity? As the kabalists justly say, \"Death does not exist, and man neversteps outside of universal life. Those whom we think dead live still in us, aswe live in them. . . . The more one lives for his kind, the less need he fear todie.\" *****And, we might add, that he who lives for humanity does even more thanhim who dies for it. The Ineffable name, in the search for which so many kabalists--unacquainted withany Oriental or even European adept--vainly consume their knowledge and lives,dwells latent in the heart of every man. This mirific name which, according tothe most ancient oracles, \"rushes into the infinite worlds α{! 0x63 c !}cηοιμετοσροπηαλιγνι,\" can be obtained in a twofold way: by regular initiation, andthrough the \"small voice\" which Elijah heard in the cave of Horeb, the mount ofGod. And \"when Elijah heard it he wrapped his face in his mantle and stood inthe entering of the cave. And behold there came the voice.\" When Apollonius of Tyana desired to hear the \"small voice,\" he used to wraphimself up entirely in a mantle of fine wool, on which he placed both his feet,after having performed certain magnetic passes, and pronounced not the \"name\"but an invocation well known to every adept. Then he drew the mantle over hishead and face, and his translucid or astral spirit was free. On ordinaryoccasions he wore wool no more than the priests of the temples. The possessionof the secret combination of the \"name\" gave the hierophant supreme power overevery being, human or otherwise, inferior to himself in soul-strength. Hence,when Max Muller tells us of the Quiche \"Hidden majesty which was never to beopened by human hands,\" the kabalist perfectly understands what was meant by theexpression, and is not at all surprised to hear even this most eruditephilologist exclaim: \"What it was we do not know!\" We cannot too often repeat that it is only through the doctrines of the moreancient philosophies that the religion preached by Jesus may be understood. Itis through Pythagoras, Confucius, and Plato, that we can comprehend the ideawhich underlies the term \"Father\" in the New Testament. Plato's ideal of theDeity, whom he terms the one everlasting, invisible God, the Fashioner andFather of all things, * is rather the \"Father\" of Jesus. It is this Divine Beingof whom the Grecian sage says that He can neither be envious nor the originatorof evil, for He can produce nothing but what is good and just, ** is certainlynot the Mosaic Jehovah, the \"jealous God,\" but the God of Jesus, who \"alone isgood.\" He extols His all-embracing, divine power, *** and His omnipotence, butat the same time intimates that, as He is unchangeable, He can never desire tochange his laws, i.e., to extirpate evil from the world through a miracle. ****He is omniscient, and nothing escapes His watchful eye. *****His justice, whichwe find embodied in the law of compensation and retribution, will leave no crimewithout punishment, no virtue without its reward; ****** and therefore hedeclares that the only way to honor God is to cultivate moral purity. He utterlyrejects not only the anthropomorphic idea that God could have a material body,*but \"rejects with disgust those fables which ascribe passions, quarrels, andcrimes of all sorts to the minor gods.\" ** He indignantly denies that God allowsHimself to be propitiated, or rather bribed, by prayers and sacrifices. *** The Phaedrus of Plato displays all that man once was, and that which he may yetbecome again. \"Before man's spirit sank into sensuality and was embodied with itthrough the loss of his wings, he lived among the gods in the airy [spiritual]world where everything is true and pure.\" In the Timaeus he says that \"there wasa time when mankind did not perpetuate itself, but lived as pure spirits.\" Inthe future world, says Jesus, \"they neither marry nor are given in marriage,\"but \"live as the angels of God in Heaven.\" The researches of Laboulaye, Anquetil Duperron, Colebrooke, Barthelemy St.Hilaire, Max Muller, Spiegel, Burnouf, Wilson, and so many other linguists, havebrought some of the truth to light. And now that the difficulties of theSanscrit, the Thibetan, the Singhalese, the Zend, the Pehlevi, the Chinese, andeven of the Burmese, are partially conquered, and the Vedas, and theZend-Avesta, the Buddhist texts, and even Kapila's Sutras are translated, a dooris thrown wide open, which, once passed, must close forever behind anyspeculative or ignorant calumniators of the old religions. Even till the presenttime, the clergy have, to use the words of Max Muller--\"generally appealed tothe deviltries and orgies of heathen worship . . . but they have seldom, ifever, endeavored to discover the true and original character of the strangeforms of faith and worship which they call the work of the devil.\" **** When weread the true history of Buddha and Buddhism, by Muller, and the enthusiasticopinions of both expressed by Barthelemy St. Hilaire, and Laboulaye; and when,finally, a Popish missionary, an eye-witness, and one who least of all can beaccused of partiality to the Buddhists--the Abbe Huc, we mean--finds occasionfor nothing but admiration for the high individual character of these\"devil-worshippers\"; we must consider Sakya-muni's philosophy as something morethan the religion of fetishism and atheism, which the Catholics would have usbelieve it. Huc was a missionary and it was his first duty to regard Buddhism asno better than an outgrowth of the worship of Satan. The poor Abbe was struckoff the list of missionaries at Rome, ***** after his book of travels waspublished. This illustrates how little we may expect to learn the truth aboutthe religions of other people, through missionaries, when their accounts arefirst revised by the superior ecclesiastical authorities, and the formerseverely punished for telling the truth. When these men who have been and still are often termed \"the obscene ascetics,\"the devotees of different sects of India in short, generally termed \"Yogi,\" wereasked by Marco Polo, \"how it comes that they are not ashamed to go stark nakedas they do?\" they answered the inquirer of the thirteenth century as amissionary of the nineteenth was answered. \"We go naked,\" they say, \"becausenaked we came into the world, and we desire to have nothing about us that is ofthis world. Moreover, we have no sin of the flesh to be conscious of, andtherefore, we are not ashamed of our nakedness any more than you are to showyour hand or your face. You who are conscious of the sins of the flesh, do wellto have shame, and to cover your nakedness.\" * One could make a curious list of the excuses and explanations of the clergy toaccount for similarities daily discovered between Romanism and heathenreligions. Yet the summary would invariably lead to one sweeping claim: Thedoctrines of Christianity were plagiarized by the Pagans the world over! Platoand his older Academy stole the ideas from the Christian revelation--said theAlexandrian Fathers!! The Brahmans and Manu borrowed from the Jesuitmissionaries, and the Bhagaved-gita was the production of Father Calmet, whotransformed Christ and John into Christna and Arjuna to fit the Hindu mind!! Thetrifling fact that Buddhism and Platonism both antedated Christianity, and theVedas had already degenerated into Brahmanism before the days of Moses, makes nodifference. The same with regard to Apollonius of Tyana. Although histhaumaturgical powers could not be denied in the face of the testimony ofemperors, their courts, and the populations of several cities; and although fewof these had ever heard of the Nazarene prophet whose \"miracles\" had beenwitnessed by a few apostles only, whose very individualities remain to this daya problem in history, yet Apollonius has to be accepted as the \"monkey ofChrist.\" If of really pious, good, and honest men, many are yet found among the Catholic,Greek, and Protestant clergy, whose sincere faith has the best of theirreasoning powers, and who having never been among heathen populations, areunjust only through ignorance, it is not so with the missionaries. Theinvariable subterfuge of the latter is to attribute to demonolatry the reallyChrist-like life of the Hindu and Buddhist ascetics and many of the lamas. Yearsof sojourn among \"heathen\" nations, in China, Tartary, Thibet, and Hindustanhave furnished them with ample evidence how unjustly the so-called idolatorshave been slandered. The missionaries have not even the excuse of sincere faithto give the world that they mislead; and, with very few exceptions, one mayboldly paraphrase the remark made by Garibaldi, and say that: \"A priest knowshimself to be an impostor, unless he be a fool, or have been taught to lie fromboyhood.\" [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES290:* Not only did the Buddhist missionaries make their way to the MesopotamianValley, but they even went so far west as Ireland. The Rev. Dr. Lundy, in hiswork on \"Monumental Christianity,\" referring to an Irish Round Tower, observes:\"Henry O'Brien explains this Round Tower Crucifixion as that of Buddha; theanimals as the elephant and the bull, sacred to Buddha, and into which his soulentered after death; the two figures standing beside the cross as Buddha'svirgin mother, and Kama his favorite disciple. The whole picture bears a closelikeness to the Crucifixion, in the cemetery of Pope Julius, except the animals,which are conclusive proof that it cannot be Christian. It came ultimately fromthe far East to Ireland, with the Phoenician colonists, who erected the RoundTowers as symbols of the life-giving and preserving power of man and nature, andhow that universal life is produced through suffering and death.\" When a Protestant clergyman is thus forced to confess the pre-Christianexistence of the crucifix in Ireland, its Buddhistic character, and thepenetration of the missionaries of that faith even to that then remote portionof the earth, we need not wonder that in the minds of the Nazareancontemporaries of Jesus and their descendants, he should not have beenassociated with that universally known emblem in the character of a Redeemer. In noticing this admission of Dr. Lundy, Mr. Charles Sotheran remarked, in alecture before the American Philological Society, that both legends andarchaeological remains unite in proving beyond question \"that Ireland, likeevery other nation, once listened to the propagandists of Siddhartha-Buddha.\" 291:* \"The religion of multiplied baptisms, the scion of the still existent sectnamed the 'Christians of St. John,' or Mendaecans, whom the Arabs callel-Mogtasila and Baptists.

In the \"Life ofManes,\" given by Epiphanius, in his \"Haer.,\" lxvi., is mentioned a certainpriest of Mithras, a friend of the great Haeresiarch Manes, named Parchus. 295:* Its description is found in one of the magic books of the Egyptian KingNechepsos, and its use prescribed on green jasper stones, as a potent amulet.Galen mentions it in his work, \"De Simp.

We see the same in the EleusinianMysteries. Belonging to every temple there were attached the \"hierophants\" ofthe inner sanctuary, and the secular clergy who were not even instructed in theMysteries. It is against the absurdities and superstitions of the latter thatDarius revolted, and \"crushed them,\" for the inscription of his tomb shows thathe was a \"hierophant\" and a Magian himself. It is also but the exoteric rites ofthis class of Magi which descended to posterity, for the great secresy in whichwere preserved the \"Mysteries\" of the true Chaldean Magi was never violated,however much guess-work may have been expended on them. 306:***xxiii., 6. 306:****\"The Gnostics and their Remains,\" p. 185. 307:*These are truths which cannot fail to impress themselves upon the minds ofearnest thinkers. While the Ebionites, Nazarites, Hemerobaptists, Lampseans,Sabians, and the many other earliest sects which wavered later between thevarying dogmatisms suggested to them by the esoteric and misunderstood parablesof the Nazarene teacher, whom they justly regarded as a prophet, there were men,for whose names we would vainly search history, who preserved the secretdoctrines of Jesus as pure and unadulterated as they had been received. Andstill, even all these above-mentioned and conflicting sects were far moreorthodox in their Christianity, or rather Christism, than the Churches ofConstantine and Rome. \"It was a strange fate that befell these unfortunatepeople\" (the Ebionites), says Lord Amberley, \"when, overwhelmed by the flood ofheathenism that had swept into the Church, they were condemned as heretics. Yet,there is no evidence that they had ever swerved from the doctrines of Jesus, orof the disciples who knew him in his lifetime. . . . Jesus himself wascircumcised . . . reverenced the temple at Jerusalem as 'a house of prayer forall nations.' . . . But the torrent of progress swept past the Ebionites, andleft them stranded on the shore\" (\"An Analysis of Religious Beliefs,\" byViscount Amberley, vol. i., p. 446). 308:* What will, perhaps, still more astonish American readers, is the factthat, in the United States, a mystical fraternity now exists, which claims anintimate relationship with one of the oldest and most powerful of EasternBrotherhoods. It is known as the Brotherhood of Luxor, and its faithful membershave the custody of very important secrets of science. Its ramifications extendwidely throughout the great Republic of the West. Though this brotherhood hasbeen long and hard at work, the secret of its existence has been jealouslyguarded. Mackenzie describes it as having \"a Rosicrucian basis, and numberingmany members\" (\"Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia,\" p. 461). But, in this, the author ismistaken; it has no Rosicrucian basis. The name Luxor is primarily derived fromthe ancient Beloochistan city of Looksur, which lies between Bela and Kedgee,and also gave its name to the Egyptian city. 308:** These people do not accept the name of Druzes, but regard the appellationas an insult. They call themselves the \"disciples of Hamsa,\" their Messiah, whocame to them, in the tenth century, from the \"Land of the Word of God,\" and,together with his disciple, Mochtana Boha-eddin, committed this Word to writing,and entrusted it p. 309 to the care of a few initiates, with the injunction ofthe greatest secresy. They are usually called Unitarians. 309:*The Okhal (from the Arabic akl--intelligence or wisdom) are the initiated,or wise men of this sect.

The okhals nevercountenance deliberate falsehood in any form, although the laymen have many atime got rid of the spies sent by the Christians to discover their secrets, bydeceiving them with sham initiations.

In the hymns of the \"Veda\" we see manleft to himself to solve the riddle of this world. . . . He invokes the godsaround him, he praises, he worships them. But still with all these gods . . .beneath him, and above him, the early poet seems ill at rest within himself.There, too, in his own breast, he has discovered a power that is never mute whenhe prays, never absent when he fears and trembles. It seems to inspire hisprayers, and yet to listen to them; it seems to live in him, and yet to supporthim and all around him. The only name he can find for this mysterious power is'Brahman'; for brahman meant originally force, will, wish, and the propulsivepower of creation. But this impersonal brahman, too, as soon as it is named,grows into something strange and divine. It ends by being one of many gods, oneof the great triad, worshipped to the present day. And still the thought withinhim has no real name; that power which is nothing but itself, which supports thegods, the heavens, and every living being, floats before his mind, conceived butnot expressed. At last he calls it 'Atman,' for Atman, originally breath orspirit, comes to mean Self, p. 318 and Self alone; Self, whether Divine orhuman; Self, whether creating or suffering; Self, whether one or all; but alwaysSelf, independent and free. 'Who has seen the first-born,' says the poet, whenhe who had no bones (i.e., form) bore him that had bones? Where was the life,the blood, the Self of the world? Who went to ask this from any one who knewit?\" (\"Rig-Veda,\" i., 164, 4). This idea of a divine Self, once expressed,everything else must acknowledge its supremacy; \"Self is the Lord of all things,Self is the King of all things. As all the spokes of a wheel are contained inthe nave and the circumference, all things are contained in this Self; allSelves are contained in this Self.

Few of those who,while rejecting the divinity of the Nazarene prophet, still believe that he isno myth, can read the work without experiencing an uneasy, and even angryfeeling at such a psychological mutilation. He makes of Jesus a sort ofsentimental ninny, a theatrical simpleton, enamored of his own poeticaldivagations and speeches, wanting every one to adore him, and finally caught inthe snares of his enemies. Such was not Jesus, the Jewish philanthropist, theadept and mystic of a school now forgotten by the Christians and the Church--ifit ever was known to her; the hero, who preferred even to risk death, ratherthan withhold some truths which he believed would benefit humanity. We preferStrauss who openly names him an impostor and a pretender, occasionally callingin doubt his very existence; but who at least spares him that ridiculous colorof sentimentalism in which Renan paints him. 341:* See Chap. iii., p. 97. 341:**In a recent work, called the \"World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors\" (by Mr.Kersey Graves) which attracted our notice by its title, we were indeed startledas we were forewarned on the title-page we should be by historical evidences tobe found neither in history nor tradition. Apollonius, who is represented in itas one of these sixteen \"saviours,\" is shown by the author as finally \"crucified. . . having risen from the dead . . . appearing to his disciples after hisresurrection, and\"--like Christ again--\"convincing a Tommy (?) Didymus\" bygetting him to feel the print of the nails on his hands and feet (see note, p.268). To begin with, neither Philostratus, the biographer of Apollonius, norhistory says any such thing. Though the precise time of his death is unknown, nodisciple of Apollonius ever said that he was either crucified, or appeared tothem. So much for one \"Saviour.\" After that we are told that Gautama-Buddha,whose life and death have been so minutely described by several authorities,Barthelemy St. Hilaire included--was also \"crucified by his enemies near thefoot of the Nepal mountains\" (see p. 107); while the Buddhist books, history,and scientific research tell us, through the lips of Max Muller and a host ofOrientalists, that \"Gautama-Buddha, (Sakya-muni) died near the Ganges. . . . Hehad nearly reached the city of Kusinagara, when his vital strength began tofail. He halted in a forest, and while sitting under a sal tree he gave up theghost\" (Max Muller: \"Chips from a German Workshop,\" vol. i., p. 213). Thereferences of Mr. Graves to Higgins and Sir W. Jones, in some of his hazardousspeculations, prove nothing. Max Muller shows some antiquated authoritieswriting elaborate books \" . . . in order to prove that Buddha had been inreality the Thoth of the Egyptians; that he was Mercury, or Wodan, or Zoroaster,or Pythagoras. . . . Even Sir W. Jones . . . identified Buddha first with Odinand afterwards with Shishak.\" We are in the nineteenth century, not in theeighteenth; and though to write books on the authority of the earliestOrientalists may in one sense be viewed as a mark of respect for old age, it isnot always safe to try the experiment in our times. Hence this highlyinstructive volume lacks one important feature which would have made it stillmore interesting. The author should have added after Prometheus the \"Roman,\" andAlcides the Egyptian god (p. 266) a seventeenth \"crucified Saviour\" to the list,\"Venus, god of the war,\" introduced to an admiring world by Mr. Artemus Ward the\"showman\"! 342:* \"Khandogya-upanishad,\" viii., 3, 4; Max Muller: \"Veda.\" 342:** \"Idra Rabba,\" x., 117. 342:*** Introd. in \"Sohar,\" pp. 305-312. 343:*John xiv. 343:** \"Les Hauts Phenomenes de la Magie,\" p. 74. 343:*** Barthelemy St. Hilaire: \"Le Buddha et sa Religion,\" Paris, 1860. 343:**** \"Journal des Debats,\" Avril, 1853. 343:***** \"Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie.\" 344:* \"Timaeus\"; \"Tolit.,\" 269, E. 344:**\"Timaeus,\" 29; \"Phaedrus,\" 182, 247; \"Repub.,\" ii., 379, B. 344:*** \"Laws,\" iv., 715, E.; x., 901, C. 344:**** \"Repub.,\" ii., 381; \"Thaet.,\" 176, A. 344:***** \"Laws,\" x., 901, D. 344:****** \"Laws,\" iv., 716, A.; \"Repub.,\" x., 613, A. 345:* \"Phaedrus,\" 246, C. 345:** E.

Warden.--It is the first hour of the day, the time when the veilof the temple was rent asunder, when darkness and consternation were spread overthe earth--when the light was darkened--when the implements of Masonry werebroken--when the flaming star disappeared--when the cubic stone was broken--whenthe 'WORD' was lost.\"--Magna est Veritas et Praevalebit.[images/00073.jpg]-- JAH-BUH-LUN. THE greatest of the kabalistic works of the Hebrews--Sohar--was compiled byRabbi Simeon Ben-Iochai. According to some critics, this was done years beforethe Christian era; according to others only after the destruction of the temple.However, it was completed only by the son of Simeon, Rabbi Eleazar, and hissecretary, Rabbi Abba; for the work is so immense and the subjects treated soabstruse that even the whole life of this Rabbi, called the Prince of kabalists,did not suffice for the task. On account of its being known that he was inpossession of this knowledge, and of the Mercaba, which insured the reception ofthe \"Word,\" his very life was endangered, and he had to fly to the wilderness,where he lived in a cave for twelve years, surrounded by faithful disciples, andfinally died there amid signs and wonders. * But voluminous as is the work, and containing as it does the main points of thesecret and oral tradition, it still does not embrace it all. It is well knownthat this venerable kabalist never imparted the most important points of hisdoctrine otherwise than orally, and to a very limited number of friends anddisciples, including his only son. Therefore, without the final initiation intothe Mercaba the study of the Kabala will be ever incomplete, and the Mercaba canbe taught only in \"darkness, in a deserted place, and after many and terrifictrials.\" Since the death of Simeon Ben-Iochai this hidden doctrine has remainedan inviolate secret for the outside world. Delivered only as a mystery, it wascommunicated to the candidate orally, \"face to face and mouth to ear.\" This Masonic commandment, \"mouth to ear, and the word at low breath,\" is aninheritance from the Tanaim and the old Pagan Mysteries. Its modern use mustcertainly be due to the indiscretion of some renegade kabalist, though the\"word\" itself is but a \"substitute\" for the \"lost word,\" and is a comparativelymodern invention, as we will further show. The real sentence has remainedforever in the sole possession of the adepts of various countries of the Easternand Western hemispheres. Only a limited number among the chiefs of the Templars,and some Rosicrucians of the seventeenth century, always in close relations withArabian alchemists and initiates, could really boast of its possession. From theseventh to the fifteenth centuries there was no one who could claim it inEurope; and although there had been alchemists before the days of Paracelsus, hewas the first who had passed through the true initiation, that last ceremonywhich conferred on the adept the power of travelling toward the \"burning bush\"over the holy ground, and to \"burn the golden calf in the fire, grind it topowder, and strow it upon the water.\" Verily, then, this magic water, and the\"lost word,\" resuscitated more than one of the pre-Mosaic Adonirams, Gedaliahs,and Hiram Abiffs. The real word now substituted by Mac Benac and Mah was usedages before its pseudo-magical effect was tried on the \"widow's sons\" of thelast two centuries. Who was, in fact, the first operative Mason of anyconsequence? Elias Ashmole, the last of the Rosicrucians and alchemists.Admitted to the freedom of the Operative Masons' Company in London, in 1646, hedied in 1692. At that time Masonry was not what it became later; it was neithera political nor a Christian institution, but a true secret organization, whichadmitted into the ties of fellowship all men anxious to obtain the pricelessboon of liberty of conscience, and avoid clerical persecution. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_726] Not until about thirtyyears after his death did what is now termed modern Freemasonry see the light.It was born on the 24th day of June, 1717, in the Apple-tree Tavern, CharlesStreet, Covent Garden, London. And it was then, as we are told in Anderson'sConstitutions, that the only four lodges in the south of England elected AnthonySayer first Grand Master of Masons. Notwithstanding its great youth, this grandlodge has ever claimed the acknowledgment of its supremacy by the whole body ofthe fraternity throughout the whole world, as the Latin inscription on the plateput beneath the corner-stone of Freemasons' Hall, London, in 1775, would tell tothose who could see it. But of this more anon. In Die Kabbala, by Franck, the author, following its \"esoteric ravings,\" as heexpresses it, gives us, in addition to the translations, his commentaries.Speaking of his predecessors, he says that Simeon Ben-Iochai mentions repeatedlywhat the \"companions\" have taught in the older works. And the author cites one\"Ieba, the old, and Hamnuna, the old.\" * But what the two \"old\" ones mean, orwho they were, in fact, he tells us not, for he does not know himself. Among the venerable sect of the Tanaim, or rather the Tananim, the wise men,there were those who taught the secrets practically and initiated some disciplesinto the grand and final Mystery. But the Mishna Hagiga, 2d section, say thatthe table of contents of the Mercaba \"must only be delivered to wise oldones.\" **The Gemara is still more dogmatic. \"The more important secrets of theMysteries were not even revealed to all priests. Alone the initiates had themdivulged.\" And so we find the same great secresy prevalent in every ancientreligion. But, as we see, neither the Sohar nor any other kabalistic volume containsmerely Jewish wisdom. The doctrine itself being the result of whole millenniumsof thought, is therefore the joint property of adepts of every nation under thesun. Nevertheless, the Sohar teaches practical occultism more than any otherwork on that subject; not as it is translated though, and commented upon by itsvarious critics, but with the secret signs on its margins. These signs containthe hidden instructions, apart from the metaphysical interpretations andapparent absurdities so fully credited by Josephus, who was never initiated, andgave out the dead letter as he had received it. *** The real practical magic contained in the Sohar and other kabalistic works, isonly of use to those who read it within. The Christian apostles--at least, thosewho are said to have produced \"miracles\" at will *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_730]--had to be acquainted withthis science. It ill-behooves a Christian to look with horror or derision upon\"magic\" gems, amulets, and other talismans against the \"evil eye,\" which serveas charms to exercise a mysterious influence, either on the possessor, or theperson whom the magician desires to control. There are still extant a number ofsuch charmed amulets in public and private collections of antiquities.Illustrations of convex gems, with mysterious legends--the meaning of whichbaffles all scientific inquiry--are given by many collectors. King shows severalsuch in his Gnostics, and he describes a white carnelian (chalcedony), coveredon both sides with interminable legends, to interpret which would ever prove afailure; yes, in every case, perhaps, but that of a Hermetic student or anadept. But we refer the reader to his interesting work, and the talismansdescribed in his plates, to show that even the \"Seer of Patmos\" himself waswell-versed in this kabalistic science of talismans and gems. St. John clearlyalludes to the potent \"white carnelian\"--a gem well-known among adepts, as the\"alba petra,\" or the stone of initiation, on which the word \"prize\" is generallyfound engraved, as it was given to the candidate who had successfully passedthrough all the preliminary trials of a neophyte. The fact is, that no less thanthe Book of Job, the whole Revelation, is simply an allegorical narrative of theMysteries and initiation therein of a candidate, who is John himself. No highMason, well versed in the different degrees, can fail to see it. The numbersseven, twelve, and others are all so many lights thrown over the obscurity ofthe work. Paracelsus maintained the same some centuries ago. And when we findthe \"one like unto the Son of man\" saying (chap. ii. 17): \"To him thatovercometh, will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a WHITESTONE, and in the stone a new name written\"--the word--which no man knowethsaving he that receiveth it, what Master Mason can doubt but it refers to thelast head-line of this chapter? In the pre-Christian Mithraic Mysteries, the candidate who fearlessly overcamethe \"twelve Tortures,\" which preceded the final initiation, received a smallround cake or wafer of unleavened bread, symbolizing, in one of its meanings,the solar disk and known as the heavenly bread or \"manna,\" and having figurestraced on it. A lamb, or a bull was killed, and with the blood the candidate hadto be sprinkled, as in the case of the Emperor Julian's initiation. The sevenrules or mysteries were then delivered to the \"newly-born\" that are representedin the Revelation as the seven seals which are opened \"in order\" (see chap. v.and vi.). There can be no doubt that the Seer of Patmos referred to thisceremony. The origin of the Roman Catholic amulets and \"relics\" blessed by the Pope, isthe same as that of the \"Ephesian Spell,\" or magical characters engraved eitheron a stone or drawn on a piece of parchment; the Jewish amulets with verses outof the Law, and called phylacteria, Φυλακτερια, and the Mahometan charms withverses of the Koran. All these were used as protective magic spells; and worn bythe believers on their persons. Epiphanius, the worthy ex-Marcosian, who speaksof these charms when used by the Manicheans as amulets, that is to say, thingsworn round the neck (Periapta), and \"incantations and such-like trickery,\"cannot well throw a slur upon the \"trickery\" of the Pagans and Gnostics, withoutincluding the Roman Catholic and Popish amulets. But consistency is a virtue which we fear is losing, under Jesuit influence, theslight hold it may ever have had on the Church. That crafty, learned,conscienceless, terrible soul of Jesuitism, within the body of Romanism, isslowly but surely possessing itself of the whole prestige and spiritual powerthat clings to it. For the better exemplification of our theme it will benecessary to contrast the moral principles of the ancient Tanaim and Theurgistswith those professed by the modern Jesuits, who practically control Romanismto-day, and are the hidden enemy that would-be reformers must encounter andovercome. Throughout the whole of antiquity, where, in what land, can we findanything like this Order or anything even approaching it? We owe a place to theJesuits in this chapter on secret societies, for more than any other they are asecret body, and have a far closer connection with actual Masonry--in France andGermany at least--than people are generally aware of. The cry of an outragedpublic morality was raised against this Order from its very birth. *Barelyfifteen years had elapsed after the bull approving its constitution waspromulgated, when its members began to be driven away from one place to theother. Portugal and the Low Countries got rid of them, in 1578; France in 1594;Venice in 1606; Naples in 1622. From St. Petersburg they were expelled in 1815,and from all Russia in 1820. It was a promising child from its very teens. What it grew up to be every oneknows well. The Jesuits have done more moral harm in this world than all thefiendish armies of the mythical Satan. Whatever extravagance may seem to beinvolved in this remark, will disappear when our readers in America, who nowknow little about them, are made acquainted with their principles (principia)and rules as they appear in various works written by the Jesuits themselves. Webeg leave to remind the public that every one of the statements which follow inquotation marks are extracted from authenticated manuscripts, or folios printedby this distinguished body. Many are copied from the large Quarto * published bythe authority of, and verified and collated by the Commissioners of the FrenchParliament. The statements therein were collected and presented to the King, inorder that, as the \"Arrest du Parlement du 5 Mars, 1762,\" expresses it, \"theelder son of the Church might be made aware of the perversity of this doctrine.. . . A doctrine authorizing Theft, Lying, Perjury, Impurity, every Passion andCrime, teaching Homicide, Parricide, and Regicide, overthrowing religion inorder to substitute for it superstition, by favoring Sorcery, Blasphemy,Irreligion, and Idolatry . . . etc.\" Let us then examine the ideas on magic ofthe Jesuits. Writing on this subject in his secret instructions, AnthonyEscobart ** [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_733] says: \"It is lawful . . . to make use of the science acquired through the assistanceof the Devil, provided the preservation and use of that knowledge do not dependupon the Devil, for the knowledge is good in itself, and the sin by which it wasacquired has gone by.\" *** Hence, why should not a Jesuit cheat the Devil aswell as he cheats every layman? \"Astrologers and soothsayers are either bound, or are not bound, to restore thereward of their divination, if the event does not come to pass. I own,\" remarksthe good Father Escobar, \"that the former opinion does not at all please me,because, when the astrologer or diviner has exerted all the diligence in thediabolic art which is essential to his purpose, he has fulfilled his duty,whatever may be the result. As the physician . . . is not bound to restore hisfee . . . if his patient should die; so neither is the astrologer bound torestore his charge . . . except where he has used no effort, or was ignorant ofhis diabolic art; because, when he has used his endeavors he has notdeceived.\" * Further, we find the following on astrology: \"If any one affirms, throughconjecture founded upon the influence of the stars and the character,disposition of a man, that he will be a soldier, an ecclesiastic, or a bishop,this divination may be devoid of all sin; because the stars and the dispositionof the man may have the power of inclining the human will to a certain lot orrank, but not of constraining it.\" ** Busembaum and Lacroix, in Theologia Moralis, ***say, \"Palmistry may beconsidered lawful, if from the lines and divisions of the hands it can ascertainthe disposition of the body, and conjecture, with probability, the propensitiesand affections of the soul.\" **** This noble fraternity, which many preachers have of late so vehemently denied tohave ever been a secret one, has been sufficiently proved as such. Theirconstitutions were translated into Latin by the Jesuit Polancus, and printed inthe college of the Society at Rome, in 1558. \"They were jealously kept secret,the greater part of the Jesuits themselves knowing only extracts fromthem. *****They were never produced to the light until 1761, when they werepublished by order of the French Parliament in 1761, 1762, in the famous processof Father Lavalette.\" The degrees of the Order are: I. Novices; II. LayBrothers, or temporal Coadjutors; III. Scholastics; IV. Spiritual Coadjutors; V.Professed of Three Vows; VI. Professed of Five Vows. \"There is also a secretclass, known only to the General and a few faithful Jesuits, which, perhaps morethan any other, contributed to the dreaded and mysterious power of the Order,\"says Niccolini. The Jesuits reckon it among the greatest achievements of theirOrder that Loyola supported, by a special memorial to the Pope, a petition forthe reorganization of that abominable and abhorred instrument of wholesalebutchery--the infamous tribunal of the Inquisition. This Order of Jesuits is now all-powerful in Rome. They have been reinstalled inthe Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, in the Department ofthe Secretary of State, and in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The PontificalGovernment was for years previous to Victor Emanuel's occupation of Romeentirely in their hands. The Society now numbers 8,584 members. But we must seewhat are their chief rules. By what is seen above, in becoming acquainted withtheir mode of action, we may ascertain what the whole Catholic body is likely tobe. Says Mackenzie: \"The Order has secret signs and passwords, according to thedegrees to which the members belong, and as they wear no particular dress, it isvery difficult to recognize them, unless they reveal themselves as members ofthe Order; for they may appear as Protestants or Catholics, democrats oraristocrats, infidels or bigots, according to the special mission with whichthey are entrusted. Their spies are everywhere, of all apparent ranks ofsociety, and they may appear learned and wise, or simple or foolish, as theirinstructions run. There are Jesuits of both sexes, and all ages, and it is awell-known fact that members of the Order, of high family and delicate nurture,are acting as menial servants in Protestant families, and doing other things ofa similar nature in aid of the Society's purposes. We cannot be too much on ourguard, for the whole Society, being founded on a law of unhesitating obedience,can bring its force on any given point with unerring and fatal accuracy.\" * The Jesuits maintain that \"the Society of Jesus is not of human invention, butit proceeded from him whose name it bears. For Jesus himself described that ruleof life which the Society follows, first by his example, and afterwards by hiswords.\" ** Let, then, all pious Christians listen and acquaint themselves with this alleged\"rule of life\" and precepts of their God, as exemplified by the Jesuits. PeterAlagona (St. Thomae Aquinatis Summae Theologiae Compendium) says: \"By thecommand of God it is lawful to kill an innocent person, to steal, or commit . .. (Ex mandato Dei licet occidere innocentem, furari, fornicari); because he isthe Lord of life and death, and all things, and it is due to him thus to fulfilhis command\" (Ex prima secundae, Quaest., 94). \"A man of a religious order, who for a short time lays aside his habit for asinful purpose, is free from heinous sin, and does not incur the penalty ofexcommunication\" (Lib. iii., sec. 2., Probl. 44, D. 212). *** John Baptist Taberna (Synopsis Theologiae Practicae), propounds the followingquestion: \"Is a judge bound to restore the bribe which he has received forpassing sentence?\" Answer: \"If he has received the bribe for passing an -unjustsentence, it is probable that he may keep it. . . . This opinion is maintainedand defended by fifty-eight doctors\" *(Jesuits). We must abstain at present from proceeding further. So disgustingly licentious,hypocritical, and demoralizing are nearly all of these precepts, that it wasfound impossible to put many of them in print, except in the Latin language. **We will return to some of the more decent as we proceed, for the sake ofcomparison. But what are we to think of the future of the Catholic world, if itis to be controlled in word and deed by this villainous society? And that it isto be so, we can hardly doubt, as we find the Cardinal Archbishop of Cambrailoudly proclaiming the same to all the faithful? His pastoral has made a certainnoise in France; and yet, as two centuries have rolled away since the expose ofthese infamous principles, the Jesuits have had ample time to lie sosuccessfully in denying the just charges, that most Catholics will never believesuch a thing. The infallible Pope, Clement XIV. (Ganganelli), suppressed them onthe 23d of July, 1773, and yet they came to life again; and another equallyinfallible Pope, Pius VII., reestablished them on the 7th of August, 1814. But we will hear what Monseigneur of Cambrai is swift to proclaim in 1876. Wequote from a secular paper: \"Among other things, he maintains that Clericalism, Ultramontanism, andJesuitism are one and the same thing--that is to say, Catholicism--and that thedistinctions between them have been created by the enemies of religion. Therewas a time, he says, when a certain theological opinion was commonly professedin France concerning the authority of the Pope. It was restricted to our nation,and was of recent origin. The civil power during a century and a half imposedofficial instruction. Those who profess these opinions were called Gallicans,and those who protested were called Ultramontanes, because they had theirdoctrinal centre beyond the Alps, at Rome. To-day the distinction between thetwo schools is no longer admissible. Theological Gallicanism can no longerexist, since this opinion has ceased to be tolerated by the Church. It has beensolemnly condemned, past all return, by the OEcumenical Council of the Vatican.One cannot now be Catholic without being Ultramontane--and Jesuit.\" *** This settles the question. We leave inferences for the present, and proceed tocompare some of the practices and precepts of the Jesuits, with those ofindividual mystics and organized castes and societies of the ancient time. Thusthe fair-minded reader may be placed in a position to judge between them as tothe tendency of their doctrines to benefit or degrade humanity. Rabbi Jehoshua Ben Chananea, who died about A. D. 72, openly declared that hehad performed \"miracles\" by means of the Book of Sepher Jezireh, and challengedevery skeptic. * Franck, quoting from the Babylonian Talmud, names two otherthaumaturgists, Rabbis Chanina and Oshoi. ** Simon Magus was doubtless a pupil of the Tanaim of Samaria, the reputation whichhe left behind, together with the title given to him of \"the Great Power ofGod,\" testifies strongly in favor of the ability of his teachers. The calumniesso zealously disseminated against him by the unknown authors and compilers ofthe Acts and other writings, could not cripple the truth to such an extent as toconceal the fact that no Christian could rival him in thaumaturgic deeds. Thestory told about his falling during an aerial flight, breaking both his legs,and then committing suicide, is ridiculous. Instead of praying mentally that itshould so happen, why did not the apostles pray rather that they should beallowed to outdo Simon in wonders and miracles, for then they might have provedtheir case far more easily than they did, and so converted thousands toChristianity. Posterity has heard but one side of the story. Were the disciplesof Simon to have a chance, we might find, perhaps, that it was Peter who brokeboth his legs, had we not known that this apostle was too prudent ever toventure himself in Rome. On the confession of several ecclesiastical writers, noapostle ever performed such \"supernatural wonders.\" Of course pious people willsay this only the more proves that it was the \"Devil\" who worked through Simon. Simon was accused of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, because he introduced itas the \"Holy Spiritus, the Mens (Intelligence), or the mother of all.\" But wefind the same expression used in the Book of Enoch, in which, incontradistinction to the \"Son of Man,\" he says \"Son of the Woman.\" In the Codexof the Nazarenes, and in the Sohar, as well in the Books of Hermes, theexpression is usual; and even in the apocryphal Evangelium of the Hebrews weread that Jesus himself admitted the sex of the Holy Ghost by using theexpression, \"My mother, the Holy Pneuma.\" But what is the heresy of Simon, or what the blasphemies of all the heretics, incomparison with that of the same Jesuits who have now so completely mastered thePope, ecclesiastical Rome, and the entire Catholic world? Listen again to theirprofession of faith. \"Do what your conscience tells you to be good and commanded: if, throughinvincible error, you believe lying or blasphemy to be commanded by God,blaspheme.\" * \"Omit to do what your conscience tells you is forbidden: omit the worship ofGod, if you invincibly believe it to be prohibited by God.\" ** \"There is an implied law . . . obey an invincibly erroneous dictate ofconscience. As often as you believe invincibly that a lie iscommanded--lie.\" *** \"Let us suppose a Catholic to believe invincibly that the worship of images isforbidden: in such a case our Lord Jesus Christ will be obliged to say to him,'Depart from me thou cursed . . . because thou hast worshipped mine image.' So,neither, is there any absurdity in supposing that Christ may say, 'Come thoublessed . . . because thou hast lied, believing invincibly, that in such a caseI commanded the lie.'\" **** Does not this--but no! words fail to do justice to the emotions that theseastonishing precepts must awaken in the breast of every honest person. Letsilence, resulting from invincible disgust, be our only adequate tribute to suchunparalleled moral obliquity. The popular feeling in Venice (1606), when the Jesuits were driven out from thatcity, expressed itself most forcibly. Great crowds had accompanied the exiles tothe sea-shore, and the farewell cry which resounded after them over the waves,was, \"Ande in malora!\" (Get away! and woe be to you.) \"That cry was echoedthroughout the two following centuries\"; says Michelet, who gives thisstatement, \"in Bohemia in 1618 . . . in India in 1623 . . . and throughout allChristendom in 1773.\" In what particular was then Simon Magus a blasphemer, if he only did that whichhis conscience invincibly told him was true? And in what particular were everthe \"Heretics,\" or even infidels of the worst kind more reprehensible than theJesuits--those of Caen, ***** for instance--who say the following: \"The Christian religion is . . . evidently credible, but not evidently true. Itis evidently credible; for it is evident that whoever embraces it is prudent. Itis not evidently true; for it either teaches obscurely or the things which itteaches are obscure. And they who affirm that the Christian religion isevidently true, are obliged to confess that it is evidently false.\" \"Infer from hence -- \"1. That it is not evident that there is now any true religion in the world. \"2. That it is not evident that of all religions existing upon the earth, theChristian religion is the most true; for have you travelled over all countriesof the world, or do you know that others have? . . . . . . . . . . . \"4. That it is not evident that the predictions of the prophets were given byinspiration of God; for what refutation will you bring against me, if I denythat they were true prophecies, or assert that they were only conjectures? \"5. That it is not evident that the miracles were real, which are recorded tohave been wrought by Christ; although no one can prudently deny them (Position6). \"Neither is an avowed belief in Jesus Christ, in the Trinity, in all thearticles of Faith, and in the Decalogue, necessary to Christians. The onlyexplicit belief which was necessary to the former (Jews) and is necessary to thelatter (Christians) is 1, of God; 2, of a rewarding God\" (Position 8). Hence, it is also more than \"evident\" that there are moments in the life of thegreatest liar when he may utter some truths. It is in this case so perfectlyexemplified by the \"good Fathers,\" that we can see more clearly than ever whenceproceeded the solemn condemnations at the OEcumenical Council of 1870, ofcertain \"heresies,\" and the enforcement of other articles of faith in which nonebelieved less than those who inspired the Pope to issue them. History has yetperhaps to learn that the octogenarian Pope, intoxicated with the fumes of hisnewly-enforced infallibility, was but the faithful echo of the Jesuits. \"An oldman is raised trembling upon the pavois of the Vatican\"; says Michelet, \"everything becomes absorbed and confined in him. . . . For fifteen centuriesChristendom had submitted to the spiritual yoke of the Church. . . . But thatyoke was not sufficient for them; they wanted the whole world to bend under thehand of one master. Here my own words are too weak; I shall borrow those ofothers. They (the Jesuits) wanted (this is the accusation flung in their facesby the Bishop of Paris in the full Council of Trent) faire de l'epouse de JesusChrist une prostituee aux volontes d'un homme.\" * They have succeeded. The Church is henceforth an inert tool, and the Pope a poorweak instrument in the hands of this Order. But for how long Until the endcomes, well may sincere Christians remember the prophetic lamentations of thethrice-great Trismegistus over his own country: \"Alas, alas, my son, a day willcome when the sacred hieroglyphics will become but idols. The world will mistakethe emblems of science for gods, and accuse grand Egypt of having worshippedhell-monsters. But those who will calumniate us thus, will themselves worshipDeath instead of Life, folly in place of wisdom; they will denounce love andfecundity, fill their temples with dead men's bones, as relics, and waste theiryouth in solitude and tears. Their virgins will be widows (nuns) before beingwives, and consume themselves in grief; because men will have despised andprofaned the sacred mysteries of Isis.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_754] How correct this prophecy has proved we find in the following Jesuit precept,which again we extract from the Report of the Commissioners to the Parliament ofParis: \"The more true opinion is, that all inanimate and irrational things may belegitimately worshipped,\" says Father Gabriel Vasquez, treating of Idolatry. \"Ifthe doctrine which we have established be rightly understood, not only may apainted image and every holy thing, set forth by public authority for theworship of God, be properly adored with God as the image of Himself, but alsoany other thing of this world, whether it be inanimate and irrational, or in itsnature rational.\" ** \"Why may we not adore and worship with God, apart from danger, anythingwhatsoever of this world; for God is in it according to His essence . . . [Thisis precisely what the Pantheist and Hindu philosophy maintains.] and preservesit continually by His power; and when we bow down ourselves before it andimpress it with a kiss, we present ourselves before God, the author of it, withthe whole soul, as unto the prototype of the image [follow instances of relics,etc.] . . . . To this we may add that, since everything of this world is thework of God, and God is always abiding and working in it, we may more readilyconceive Him to be in it than a saint in the vesture which belonged to him. And,therefore, without regarding in any way the dignity of the thing created, todirect our thoughts to God, while we give to the creature the sign and mark ofsubmission by a kiss or prostration, is neither vain nor superstitious, but anact of the purest religion.\" *** A precept this, which, whether or not doing honor to the Christian Church, mayat least be profitably quoted by any Hindu, Japanese, or other heathen whenrebuked for his worship of idols. We purposely quote it for the benefit of ourrespected \"heathen\" friends who will see these lines. The prophecy of Hermes is less equivocal than either of the alleged propheciesof Isaiah, which have furnished a pretext for saying that the gods of all thenations were demons. Only, facts are stronger, sometimes, than the strongestfaith. All that the Jews learned, they had from older nations than themselves.The Chaldean Magi were their masters in the secret doctrine, and it was duringthe Babylonian captivity that they learned its metaphysical as well as practicaltenets. Pliny mentions three schools of Magi: one that he shows to have beenfounded at an unknown antiquity; the other established by Osthanes andZoroaster; the third by Moses and Jambres. And all the knowledge possessed bythese different schools, whether Magian, Egyptian, or Jewish, was derived fromIndia, or rather from both sides of the Himalayas. Many a lost secret liesburied under wastes of sand, in the Gobi Desert of Eastern Turkestan, and thewise men of Khotan have preserved strange traditions and knowledge of alchemy. Baron Bunsen shows that the origin of the ancient prayers and hymns of theEgyptian Book of the Dead is anterior to Menes, and belongs, probably, to thepre-Menite Dynasty of Abydos, between 3100 and 4500 B.C. The learnedEgyptologist makes the era of Menes, or National Empire, as not later than 3059B.C., and demonstrates that \"the system of Osirian worship and mythology wasalready formed\" * before this era of Menes. We find in the hymns of this scientifically-established pre-Edenic epoch (forBunsen carries us back several centuries beyond the year of the creation of theworld, 4004 B.C., as fixed by biblical chronology) precise lessons of morality,identical in substance, and nearly so in form of expression, with those preachedby Jesus in his Sermon on the Mount. We give the authority of the most eminentEgyptologists and hierologists for our statement. \"The inscriptions of thetwelfth Dynasty are filled with ritualistic formulae,\" says Bunsen. Extractsfrom the Hermetic books are found on monuments of the earliest dynasties, and\"on those of the twelfth (dynasty) portions of an earlier ritual are by no meansuncommon. . . . To feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked,bury the dead . . . formed the first duty of a pious man. . . . The doctrine ofthe immortality of the soul is as old as this period\" (Tablet, Brit. Mus.,562). ** And far older, perhaps. It dates from the time when the soul was an objectivebeing, hence when it could hardly be denied by itself; when humanity was aspiritual race and death existed not. Toward the decline of the cycle of life,the ethereal man-spirit then fell into the sweet slumber of temporaryunconsciousness in one sphere, only to find himself awakening in the stillbrighter light of a higher one. But while the spiritual man is ever striving toascend higher and higher toward its source of being, passing through the cyclesand spheres of individual life, physical man had to descend with the great cycleof universal creation until it found itself clothed with the terrestrialgarments. Thenceforth the soul was too deeply buried under physical clothing toreassert its existence, except in the cases of those more spiritual natures,which, with every cycle, became more rare. And yet none of the pre-historicalnations ever thought of denying either the existence or the immortality of theinner man, the real \"self.\" Only, we must bear in mind the teachings of the oldphilosophies: the spirit alone is immortal--the soul, per se, is neither eternalnor divine. When linked too closely with the physical brain of its terrestrialcasket, it gradually becomes a finite mind, a simple animal and sentientlife-principle, the nephesh of the Hebrew Bible. * The doctrine of man's triune nature is as clearly defined in the Hermetic booksas it is in Plato's system, or again in that of the Buddhist and Brahmanicalphilosophies. And this is one of the most important as well as least understoodof the doctrines of Hermetic science. The Egyptian Mysteries, so imperfectlyknown by the world, and only through the few brief allusions to them in theMetamorphoses of Apuleius, taught the greatest virtues. They unveiled to theaspirant in the \"higher\" mysteries of initiation that which many of our modernHermetic students vainly search for in the kabalistic books, and which noobscure teachings of the Church, under the guidance of the Order of Jesuits,will ever be able to unveil. To compare, then, the ancient secret societies ofthe hierophants with the artificially-produced hallucinations of those fewfollowers of Loyola, who were, perchance, sincere at the beginning of theircareer, is to insult the former. And yet, in justice to them, we are compelledto do so. One of the most unconquerable obstacles to initiation, with the Egyptians aswith the Greeks, was any degree of murder. One of the greatest titles toadmission in the Order of Jesuits is a murder in defence of Jesuitism. \"Childrenmay kill their parents if they compel them to abandon the Catholic faith.\" \"Christian and Catholic sons,\" says Stephen Fagundez, \"may accuse their fathersof the crime of heresy if they wish to turn them from the faith, although theymay know that their parents will be burned with fire, and put to death for it,as Tolet teaches. . . . And not only may they refuse them food . . . but theymay also justly kill them.\" * It is well known that Nero, the Emperor, had never dared seek initiation intothe Mysteries on account of the murder of Agrippina! Under Section XIV. of the Principles of the Jesuits, we find on Homicide thefollowing Christian principles inculcated by Father Henry Henriquez, in SummaeTheologiae Moralis. Tomus 1, Venetiis, 1600 (Ed. Coll. Sion): \"If an adulterer,even though he should be an ecclesiastic . . . being attacked by the husband,kills his aggressor . . . he is not considered irregular: non rideturirregularis\" (Lib. XIV., de Irregularitae, c. 10, § 3). \"If a father were obnoxious to the State (being in banishment), and to thesociety at large, and there were no other means of averting such an injury, thenI should approve of this\" (for a son to kill his father), says Sec. XV., onParricide and Homicide. ** \"It will be lawful for an ecclesiastic, or one of the religious order, to kill acalumniator who threatens to spread atrocious accusations against himself or hisreligion,\" *** is the rule set forth by the Jesuit Francis Amicus. So far, good. We are informed by the highest authorities what a man in theCatholic communion may do that the common law and public morality stamp ascriminal, and still continue in the odor of Jesuitical sanctity. Now suppose weagain turn the medal and see what principles were inculcated by Pagan Egyptianmoralists before the world was blessed with these modern improvements in ethics. In Egypt every city of importance was separated from its burial place by asacred lake. The same ceremony of judgment which the Book of the Dead describesas taking place in the world of Spirit, took place on earth during the burial ofthe mummy. Forty-two judges or assessors assembled on the shore and judged thedeparted \"soul\" according to its actions when in the body, and it was only upona unanimous approval of this post-mortem jury that the boatman, who representedthe Spirit of Death, could convey the justified defunct's body to its lastresting-place. After that the priests returned within the sacred precincts andinstructed the neophytes upon the probable solemn drama which was then takingplace in the invisible realm whither the soul had fled. The immortality of thespirit was strongly inculcated by the Al-om-jah. * In the Crata Repoa **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_764] the following is describedas the seven degrees of the initiation. After a preliminary trial at Thebes, where the neophyte had to pass through manytrials, called the \"Twelve Tortures,\" he was commanded to govern his passionsand never lose for a moment the idea of his God. Then as a symbol of thewanderings of the unpurified soul, he had to ascend several ladders and wanderin darkness in a cave with many doors, all of which were locked. When he hadovercome the dreadful trials, he received the degree of Pastopkoris, the secondand third degrees being called the Neocoris, and the Melanephoris. Brought intoa vast subterranean chamber thickly furnished with mummies lying in state, hewas placed in presence of the coffin which contained the mutilated body ofOsiris covered with blood. This was the hall called \"Gates of Death,\" and it ismost certainly to this mystery that the passages in the Book of Job (xxxviii.17) and other portions of the Bible allude when these gates are spoken of. ***In chapter x., we give the esoteric interpretation of the \"Book of Job,\" whichis the poem of initiation par excellence. \"Have the gates of death been opened to thee?Hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?\"asks the \"Lord\"--i.e., the Al-om-jah, the Initiator--of Job, alluding to thisthird degree of initiation. When the neophyte had conquered the terrors of this trial, he was conducted tothe \"Hall of Spirits,\" to be judged by them. Among the rules in which he wasinstructed, he was commanded \"never to either desire or seek revenge; to bealways ready to help a brother in danger, even unto the risk of his own life; tobury every dead body; to honor his parents above all; respect old age andprotect those weaker than himself; and finally, to ever bear in mind the hour ofdeath, and that of resurrection, in a new and imperishable body.\" *Purity andchastity were highly recommended, and adultery threatened with death. Then the Egyptian neophyte was made a Kristophores. In this degree themystery-name of IAO was communicated to him. The fifth degree was that ofBalahala, and he was instructed by Horus, in alchemy, the \"word\" being chemia.In the sixth, the priestly dance in the circle was taught him, in which he wasinstructed in astronomy, for it represented the course of the planets. In theseventh degree, he was initiated into the final Mysteries. After a finalprobation in a building set apart for it, the Astronomus, as he was now called,emerged from these sacred apartments called Manneras, and received a cross--theTau, which, at death, had to be laid upon his breast. He was a hierophant. We have read above the rules of these holy initiates of the Christian Society ofJesus. Compare them with those enforced upon the Pagan postulant, and Christian(!) morality with that inculcated in those mysteries of the Pagans upon whichall the thunders of an avenging Deity are invoked by the Church. Had the latterno mysteries of its own? Or were they in any wise purer, nobler, or moreinciting to a holy, virtuous life? Let us hear what Niccolini has to say, in hisable History of the Jesuits, of the modern mysteries of the Christiancloister. ** \"In most monasteries, and more particularly in those of the Capuchins andreformed (reformati), there begins at Christmas a series of feasts, whichcontinues till Lent. All sorts of games are played, the most splendid banquetsare given, and in the small towns, above all, the refectory of the convent isthe best place of amusement for the greater number of the inhabitants. Atcarnivals, two or three very magnificent entertainments take place; the board soprofusely spread that one might imagine that Copia had here poured forth thewhole contents of her horn. It must be remembered that these two orders live byalms. *** The somber silence of the cloister is replaced by a confused sound ofmerry-making, and its gloomy vaults now echo with other songs than those of thepsalmist. A ball enlivens and terminates the feast; and, to render it still moreanimated, and perhaps to show how completely their vow of chastity haseradicated all their carnal appetite, some of the young monks appearcoquettishly dressed in the garb of the fair sex, and begin the dance, alongwith others, transformed into gay cavaliers. To describe the scandalous scenewhich ensues would be but to disgust my readers. I will only say that I havemyself often been a spectator at such saturnalia.\" The cycle is moving down, and, as it descends, the physical and bestial natureof man develops more and more at the expense of the Spiritual Self. * With whatdisgust may we not turn from this religious farce called modern Christianity, tothe noble faiths of old! In the Egyptian Funeral Ritual found among the hymns of the Book of the Dead,and which is termed by Bunsen \"that precious and mysterious book,\" we read anaddress of the deceased, in the character of Horus, detailing all that he hasdone for his father Osiris. Among other things the deity says: \"30. I have given thee thy Spirit.31. I have given thee thy Soul.32. I have given thee thy force (body),\" etc.In another place the entity, addressed as \"Father\" by the disembodied soul, isshown to mean the \"spirit\" of man; for the verse says: \"I have made my soul comeand speak with his Father,\" its Spirit. * The Egyptians regarded their Ritual as essentially a Divine inspiration; inshort, as modern Hindus do the Vedas, and modern Jews their Mosaic books. Bunsenand Lepsius show that the term Hermetic means inspired; for it is Thoth, theDeity itself, that speaks and reveals to his elect among men the will of God andthe arcana of divine things. Portions of them are expressly stated \"to have beenwritten by the very finger of Thoth himself\"; to have been the work andcomposition of the great God. ** \"At a later period their Hermetic character isstill more distinctly recognized, and on a coffin of the 26th Dynasty, Horusannounces to the deceased that Thoth himself has brought him the books of hisdivine words, or Hermetic writings.\" *** Since we are aware that Moses was an Egyptian priest, or at least that he waslearned in all their wisdom, we need not be astonished that he should write inDeuteronomy (ix. 10). \"And the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stoneswritten with the finger of GOD\"; or to find in Exodus xxxi., \"And he (the Lord)gave unto Moses . . . two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with thefinger of God.\" In the Egyptian notions, as in those of all other faiths founded on philosophy,man was not merely, as with the Christians, a union of soul and body; he was atrinity when spirit was added to it. Besides, that doctrine made him consist ofkha--body; khaba--astral form, or shadow; ka--animal soul or life-principle;ba--the higher soul; and akh--terrestrial intelligence. They had also a sixthprinciple named Sah--or mummy; but the functions of this one commenced onlyafter the death of the body. After due purification, during which the soul,separated from its body, continued to revisit the latter in its mummifiedcondition, this astral soul \"became a God,\" for it was finally absorbed into\"the Soul of the world.\" It became transformed into one of the creative deities,\"the god of Phtah,\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_773] theDemiurgos, a generic name for the creators of the world, rendered in the Bibleas the Elohim. In the Ritual the good or purified soul, \"in conjunction with itshigher or uncreated spirit, is more or less the victim of the dark influence ofthe dragon Apophis. If it has attained the final knowledge of the heavenly andthe infernal mysteries--the gnosis, i.e., complete reunion with the spirit, itwill triumph over its enemies; if not the soul could not escape its seconddeath. It is 'the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone' (elements), intowhich those that are cast undergo a 'second death' \" ** (Apocalypse). This deathis the gradual dissolution of the astral form into its primal elements, alludedto several times already in the course of this work. But this awful fate can beavoided by the knowledge of the \"Mysterious Name\"--the \"Word,\" *** say thekabalists. And what then was the penalty attached to the neglect of it? When man leads anaturally pure, virtuous life, there is none whatever; except delay in the worldof spirits, until he finds himself sufficiently purified to receive it from hisSpiritual \"Lord,\" one of the mighty Host. But if otherwise, the \"soul,\" as ahalf animal principle, becomes paralyzed, and grows unconscious of itssubjective half--the Lord--and in proportion to the sensuous development of thebrain and nerves, sooner or later, it finally loses sight of its divine missionon earth. Like the Vourdalak, or Vampire, of the Servian tale, the brain feedsand lives and grows in strength and power at the expense of its spiritualparent. Then the already half-unconscious soul, now fully intoxicated by thefumes of earthly life, becomes senseless, beyond hope of redemption. It ispowerless to discern the splendor of its higher spirit, to hear the warningvoice of its \"guardian Angel,\" and its \"God.\" It aims but at the development andfuller comprehension of natural, earthly life; and thus, can discover but themysteries of physical nature. Its grief and fear, hope and joy, are all closelyblended with its terrestrial existence. It ignores all that cannot bedemonstrated by either its organs of action, or sensation. It begins by becomingvirtually dead; it dies at last completely. It is annihilated. Such acatastrophe may often happen long years before the final separation of thelife-principle from the body. When death arrives, its iron and clammy graspfinds work with life as usual; but there is no more a soul to liberate. Thewhole essence of the latter has been already absorbed by the vital system of thephysical man. Grim death frees but a spiritual corpse; at best an idiot. Unableeither to soar higher or awaken from lethargy, it is soon dissolved in theelements of the terrestrial atmosphere. Seers, righteous men, who had attained to the highest science of the inner manand the knowledge of truth, have, like Marcus Antoninus, received instructions\"from the gods,\" in sleep and otherwise. Helped by the purer spirits, those thatdwell in \"regions of eternal bliss,\" they have watched the process and warnedmankind repeatedly. Skepticism may sneer; faith, based on knowledge andspiritual science, believes and affirms. Our present cycle is preeminently one of such soul-deaths. We elbow soulless menand women at every step in life. Neither can we wonder, in the present state ofthings, at the gigantic failure of Hegel's and Schelling's last efforts at somemetaphysical construction of a system. When facts, palpable and tangible factsof phenomenal Spiritualism happen daily and hourly, and yet are denied by themajority of \"civilized\" nations, little chance is there for the acceptance ofpurely abstract metaphysics by the ever-growing crowd of materialists. In the book called by Champollion La Manifestation a la Lumiere, there is achapter on the Ritual which is full of mysterious dialogues, with addresses tovarious \"Powers\" by the soul. Among these dialogues there is one which is morethan expressive of the potentiality of the \"Word.\" The scene is laid in the\"Hall of the Two Truths.\" The \"Door,\" the \"Hall of Truth,\" and even the variousparts of the gate, address the soul which presents itself for admission. Theyall forbid it entrance unless it tells them their mystery, or mystic names. Whatstudent of the Secret Doctrines can fail to recognize in these names an identityof meaning and purpose with those to be met with in the Vedas, the later worksof the Brahmans, and the Kabala? Magicians, Kabalists, Mystics, Neo-platonists and Theurgists of Alexandria, whoso surpassed the Christians in their achievements in the secret science;Brahmans or Samaneans (Shamans) of old; and modern Brahmans, Buddhists, andLamaists, have all claimed that a certain power attaches to these various names,pertaining to one ineffable Word. We have shown from personal experience howdeeply the belief is rooted to this day in the popular mind all over Russia, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_776] that the Word works\"miracles\" and is at the bottom of every magical feat. Kabalists mysteriouslyconnect Faith with it. So did the apostles, basing their assertions on the wordsof Jesus, who is made to say: \"If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed . . .nothing shall be impossible unto you,\" and Paul, repeating the words of Moses,tells that \"the WORD is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is,the word of faith\" (Romans x. 8). But who, except the initiates, can boast ofcomprehending its full significance? In our days it is as it was in olden times, to believe in the biblical\"miracles\" requires faith; but to be enabled to produce them one's self demandsa knowledge of the esoteric meaning of the \"word.\" \"If Christ,\" say Dr. Farrarand Canon Westcott, \"wrought no miracles, then the gospels are untrustworthy.\"But even supposing that he did work them, would that prove that gospels writtenby others than himself are any more trustworthy? And if not, to what purpose isthe argument? Besides, such a line of reasoning would warrant the analogy thatmiracles performed by other religionists than Christians ought to make theirgospels trustworthy. Does not this imply at least an equality between theChristian Scriptures and the Buddhist sacred books? For these equally aboundwith phenomena of the most astounding character. Moreover, the Christians haveno longer genuine miracles produced through their priests, for they have lostthe Word. But many a Buddhist Lama or Siamese Talapoin--unless all travellershave conspired to lie--has been and now is able to duplicate every phenomenondescribed in the New Testament, and even do more, without any pretence ofsuspension of natural law or divine intervention either. In fact, Christianityproves that it is as dead in faith as it is dead in works, while Buddhism isfull of vitality and supported by practical proofs. The best argument in favor of the genuineness of Buddhist \"miracles\" lies in thefact that Catholic missionaries, instead of denying them or treating them assimple jugglery--as some Protestant missionaries do, have often found themselvesin such straits as to be forced to adopt the forlorn alternative of laying thewhole on the back of the Devil. And so belittled do the Jesuits feel themselvesin the presence of these genuine servants of God, that with an unparalleledcunning, they concluded to act in the case of the Talapoins and Buddhists asMahomet is said to have acted with the mountain. \"And seeing that it would notmove toward him, the Prophet moved himself toward the mountain.\" Finding thatthey could not catch the Siamese with the birdlime of their pernicious doctrinesin Christian garb, they disguised themselves, and for centuries appeared amongthe poor, ignorant people as Talapoins, until exposed. They have even voted andadopted a resolution forthwith, which has now all the force of an ancientarticle of faith. \"Naaman, the Syrian,\" say the Jesuits of Caen, \"did notdissemble his faith when he bowed the knee with the king in the house of Rimmon;neither do the Fathers of the Society of Jesus dissemble, when they adopt theinstitute and the habit of the Talapoins of Siam\" (nec dissimulant Patres S. J.Talapoinorum Siamensium institutum vestemque affectantes.--Position 9, 30 Jan.,1693). The potency contained in the Mantras and the Vach of the Brahmans is as muchbelieved in at this day as it was in the early Vedic period. The \"IneffableName\" of every country and religion relates to that which the Masons affirm tobe the mysterious characters emblematic of the nine names or attributes by whichthe Deity was known to the initiates. The Omnific Word traced by Enoch on thetwo deltas of purest gold, on which he engraved two of the mysteriouscharacters, is perhaps better known to the poor, uneducated \"heathen\" than tothe highly accomplished Grand High Priests and Grand Z.'s of the SupremeChapters of Europe and America. Only why the companions of the Royal Arch shouldso bitterly and constantly lament its loss, is more than we can understand. Thisword of M. M. is, as they will tell themselves, entirely composed of consonants.Hence, we doubt whether any of them could ever have mastered its pronunciation,had it even been \"brought to light from the secret vault,\" instead of itsseveral corruptions. However, it is to the land of Mizraim that the grandson ofHam is credited with having carried the sacred delta of the Patriarch Enoch.Therefore, it is in Egypt, and in the East alone that the mysterious \"Word\" mustbe sought. But now that so many of the most important secrets of Masonry have been divulgedby friend and foe, may we not say, without suspicion of malice or ill-feeling,that since the sad catastrophe of the Templars, no \"Lodge\" in Europe, still lessin America, has ever known anything worth concealing. Reluctant to bemisunderstood, we say no Lodge, leaving a few chosen brethren entirely out ofquestion. The frantic denunciations of the Craft by Catholic and Protestantwriters appear simply ridiculous, as also the affirmation of the Abbe Barruelthat everything \"betrays our Freemasons as the descendants of those proscribedKnights\" Templars of 1314. The Memoirs of Jacobinism by this Abbe, aneye-witness to the horrors of the first Revolution, is devoted in great measureto the Rosicrucians and other Masonic fraternities. The fact alone that hetraces the modern Masons to the Templars, and points them out as secretassassins, trained to political murder, shows how little he knew of them, buthow ardently he desired, at the same time, to find in these societies convenientscape-goats for the crimes and sins of another secret society which, since itsexistence, has harbored more than one dangerous political assassin--the Societyof Jesus. The accusations against Masons have been mostly half guess-work,half-unquenchable malice and predetermined vilification. Nothing conclusive andcertain of a criminal character has been directly proven against them. Eventheir abduction of Morgan has remained a matter of conjecture. The case was usedat the time as a political convenience by huckstering politicians. When anunrecognizable corpse was found in Niagara River, one of the chiefs of thisunscrupulous class, being informed that the identity was exceedinglyquestionable, unguardedly exposed the whole plot by saying: \"Well, no matter,he's a good enough Morgan until after the election!\" On the other hand, we findthe Order of the Jesuits not only permitting, in certain cases, but actuallyteaching and inciting to \"High treason and Regicide.\" * A series of Lectures upon Freemasonry and its dangers, as delivered in 1862, byJames Burton Robertson, Professor of Modern History in the Dublin University,are lying before us. In them the lecturer quotes profusely as his authoritiesthe said Abbe (Barruel, a natural enemy of the Masons, who cannot be caught atthe confessional), and Robison, a well-known apostate-Mason of 1798. As usualwith every party, whether belonging to the Masonic or anti-Masonic side, thetraitor from the opposing camp is welcomed with praise and encouragement, andgreat care is taken to whitewash him. However convenient for certain politicalreasons the celebrated Committee of the Anti-Masonic Convention of 1830 (U. S.of America) may have found it to adopt this most Jesuitical proposition ofPuffendorf that \"oaths oblige not when they are absurd and impertinent,\" andthat other which teaches that \"an oath obliges not if God does not accept it,\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_778] yet no truly honest manwould accept such sophistry. We sincerely believe that the better portion ofhumanity will ever bear in mind that there exists a moral code of honor far morebinding than an oath, whether on the Bible, Koran, or Veda. The Essenes neverswore on anything at all, but their \"ayes\" and \"nays\" were as good and farbetter than an oath. Besides, it seems surpassingly strange to find nations thatcall themselves Christian instituting customs in civil and ecclesiastical courtsdiametrically opposed to the command of their God, ** who distinctly forbids anyswearing at all, \"neither by heaven . . .nor by the earth . . . nor by thehead.\" It seems to us that to maintain that \"an oath obliges not if God does notaccept it,\" besides being an absurdity--as no man living, whether he be fallibleor infallible, can learn anything of God's secret thoughts--is anti-Christian inthe full sense of the word. * The argument is brought forward only because it isconvenient and answers the object. Oaths will never be binding till each manwill fully understand that humanity is the highest manifestation on earth of theUnseen Supreme Deity, and each man an incarnation of his God; and when the senseof personal responsibility will be so developed in him that he will considerforswearing the greatest possible insult to himself, as well as to humanity. Nooath is now binding, unless taken by one who, without any oath at all, wouldsolemnly keep his simple promise of honor. Therefore, to bring forward asauthorities such men as Barruel or Robison is simply obtaining the publicconfidence under false pretenses. It is not the \"spirit of Masonic malice whoseheart coins slanders like a mint,\" but far more that of the Catholic clergy andtheir champions; and a man who would reconcile the two ideas of honor andperjury, in any case whatever, is not to be trusted himself. Loud is the claim of the nineteenth century to preeminence in civilization overthe ancients, and still more clamorous that of the churches and their sycophantsthat Christianity has redeemed the world from barbarism and idolatry. How littleboth are warranted, we have tried to prove in these two volumes. The light ofChristianity has only served to show how much more hypocrisy and vice itsteachings have begotten in the world since its advent, and how immenselysuperior were the ancients over us in every point of honor. ** The clergy, byteaching the helplessness of man, his utter dependence on Providence, and thedoctrine of atonement, have crushed in their faithful followers every atom ofself-reliance and self-respect. So true is this, that it is becoming an axiomthat the most honorable men are to be found among atheists and the so-called\"infidels.\" We hear from Hipparchus that in the days of heathenism \"the shameand disgrace that justly attended the violation of his oath threw the poorwretch into a fit of madness and despair, so that he cut his throat and perishedby his own hands, and his memory was so abhorred after his death that his bodylay upon the shore of the island of Samos, and had no other burial than thesands of the sea.\" *** But in our own century we find ninety-six delegates tothe United States Anti-Masonic Convention, every one doubtless a member of someProtestant Church, and claiming the respect due to men of honor and gentlemen,offering the most Jesuitical arguments against the validity of a Masonic oath.The Committee, pretending to quote the authority of \"the most distinguishedguides in the philosophy of morals, and claiming the most ample support of theinspired * . . . who wrote before Freemasonry existed,\" resolved that, as anoath was \"a transaction between man on one part and the Almighty Judge on theother,\" and the Masons were all infidels and \"unfit for civil trust,\" thereforetheir oaths had to be considered illegal and not binding. ** But we will return to these Lectures of Robertson and his charges againstMasonry. The greatest accusation brought against the latter is that Masonsreject a personal God (this on the authority of Barruel and Robison), and thatthey claim to be in possession of a \"secret to make men better and happier thanChrist, his apostles and his Church have made them.\" Were the latter accusationbut half true, it might yet allow the consoling hope that they had really foundthat secret by breaking off entirely from the mythical Christ of the Church andthe official Jehovah. But both the accusations are simply as malicious as theyare absurd and untrue; as we shall presently see. Let it not be imagined that we are influenced by personal feeling in any of ourreflections upon Masonry. So far from this being the case we unhesitatinglyproclaim our highest respect for the original purposes of the Order and some ofour most valued friends are within its membership. We say naught against Masonryas it should be, but denounce it as, thanks to the intriguing clergy, bothCatholic and Protestant, it now begins to be. Professedly the most absolute ofdemocracies, it is practically the appanage of aristocracy, wealth, and personalambition. Professedly the teacher of true ethics, it is debased into apropaganda of anthropomorphic theology. The half-naked apprentice, broughtbefore the master during the initiation of the first degree, is taught that atthe door of the lodge every social distinction is laid aside, and the poorestbrother is the peer of every other, though a reigning sovereign or an imperialprince. In practice, the Craft turns lickspittle in every monarchical country,to any regal scion who may deign, for the sake of using it as a political tool,to put on the once symbolical lambskin. How far gone is the Masonic Fraternity in this direction, we can judge from thewords of one of its highest authorities. John Yarker, Junior, of England; PastGrand Warden of the Grand Lodge of Greece; Grand Master of the Rite ofSwedenborg; also Grand Master of the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Masonry, andHeaven only knows what else, * says that Masonry could lose nothing by \"theadoption of a higher (not pecuniary) standard of membership and morality, withexclusion from the 'purple' of all who inculcate frauds, sham, historicaldegrees, and other immoral abuses\" (page 158). And again, on page 157: \"As theMasonic Fraternity is now governed, the Craft is fast becoming the paradise ofthe bon vivant; of the 'charitable' hypocrite, who forgets the version of St.Paul, and decorates his breast with the 'charity jewel' (having by thisjudicious expenditure obtained the 'purple' he metes out judgment to otherbrethren of greater ability and morality but less means); the manufacturer ofpaltry Masonic tinsel; the rascally merchant who swindles in hundreds, and eventhousands, by appealing to the tender consciences of those few who do regardtheir O. B.'s; and the Masonic 'Emperors' and other charlatans who make power ormoney out of the aristocratic pretensions which they have tacked on to ourinstitution--ad captandum vulgus.\" We have no wish to make a pretence of exposing secrets long since hawked aboutthe world by perjured Masons. Everything vital, whether in symbolicalrepresentations, rites, or passwords, as used in modern Freemasonry, is known inthe Eastern fraternities; though there seems to be no intercourse or connectionbetween them. If Medea is described by Ovid as having \"arm, breast, and kneemade bare, left foot slipshod\"; and Virgil, speaking of Dido, shows this \"Queenherself . . . now resolute on death, having one foot bare, etc.,\" **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_786] why doubt that there arein the East real \"Patriarchs of the sacred Vedas,\" explaining the esotericism ofpure Hindu theology and Brahmanism quite as thoroughly as European \"Patriarchs\"? But, if there are a few Masons who, from study of kabalistic and other rareworks, and coming in personal communication with \"Brothers\" from the far-awayEast, have learned something of esoteric Masonry, it is not the case with thehundreds of American Lodges. While engaged on this chapter, we have receivedmost unexpectedly, through the kindness of a friend, a copy of Mr. Yarker'svolume, from which passages are quoted above. It is brimful of learning and,what is more, of knowledge, as it seems to us. It is especially valuable at thismoment, since it corroborates, in many particulars, what we have said in thiswork. Thus, we read in it the following: \"We think we have sufficiently established the fact of the connection ofFreemasonry with other speculative rites of antiquity, as well as the antiquityand purity of the old English Templar-Rite of seven degrees, and the spuriousderivation of many of the other rites therefrom.\" * Such high Masons need not be told, though Craftsmen in general do, that the timehas come to remodel Masonry, and restore those ancient landmarks, borrowed fromthe early sodalities, which the eighteenth century founders of speculativeFreemasonry meant to have incorporated in the fraternity. There are no longerany secrets left unpublished; the Order is degenerating into a convenience forselfish men to use, and bad men to debase. It is but recently that a majority of the Supreme Councils of the Ancient andAccepted Rite assembled at Lausanne, justly revolting against such a blasphemousbelief as that in a personal Deity, invested with all human attributes,pronounced the following words: \"Freemasonry proclaims, as it has proclaimedfrom its origin, the existence of a creative principle, under the name of thegreat Architect of the universe.\" Against this, a small minority has protested,urging that \"belief in a creative principle is not the belief in God, whichFreemasonry requires of every candidate before he can pass its very threshold.\" This confession does not sound like the rejection of a personal God. Could wehave had the slightest doubt upon the subject, it would be thoroughly dispelledby the words of General Albert Pike, **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_788] perhaps the greatestauthority of the day, among American Masons, who raises himself most violentlyagainst this innovation. We cannot do better than quote his words: \"This Principe Createur is no new phrase--it is but an old term revived. Ouradversaries, numerous and formidable, will say, and will have the right to say,that our Principe Createur is identical with the Principe Genateur of theIndians and Egyptians, and may fitly be symbolized as it was symbolizedanciently, by the Lingae. . . . To accept this, in lieu of a personal God, is TOABANDON CHRISTIANITY, and the worship of Jehovah, and return to wallow in thestyes of Paganism.\" And are those of Jesuitism, then, so much cleaner? \"Our adversaries, numerousand formidable.\" That sentence says all. Who these so formidable enemies are, isuseless to inquire. They are the Roman Catholics, and some of the ReformedPresbyterians. To read what the two factions respectively write, we may well askwhich adversary is the more afraid of the other. But, what shall it profit anyone to organize against a fraternity that does not even dare to have a belief ofits own for fear of giving offense? And pray, how, if Masonic oaths meananything, and Masonic penalties are regarded as more than burlesque, can anyadversaries, numerous or few, feeble or strong, know what goes on inside thelodge, or penetrate beyond that \"brother terrible, or the tiler, who guards,with a drawn sword, the portals of the lodge\"? Is, then, this \"brother terrible\"no more formidable than Offenbach's General Boum, with his smoking pistol,jingling spurs, and towering panache? Of what use the millions of men that makeup this great fraternity, the world over, if they cannot be so cemented togetheras to bid defiance to all adversaries? Can it be that the \"mystic tie\" is but arope of sand, and Masonry but a toy to feed the vanity of a few leaders whorejoice in ribbons and regalia? Is its authority as false as its antiquity? Itseems so, indeed; and yet, as \"even the fleas have smaller fleas to bite 'em,\"there are Catholic alarmists, even here, who pretend to fear Masonry! And yet, these same Catholics, in all the serenity of their traditionalimpudence, publicly threaten America, with its 500,000 Masons, and 34,000,000Protestants, with a union of Church and State under the direction of Rome! Thedanger which threatens the free institutions of this republic, we are told, willcome from \"the principles of Protestantism logically developed.\" The presentSecretary of the Navy--the Hon. R. W. Thompson, of Indiana, having actuallydared, in his own free Protestant country, to publish a book recently on Papacyand the Civil Power, in which his language is as moderate as it is gentlemanlyand fair, a Roman Catholic priest, at Washington, D. C.--the very seat ofGovernment--denounces him with violence. What is better, a representative memberof the Society of Jesus, Father F. X. Weninger, D. D., pours upon his devotedhead a vial of wrath that seems to have been brought direct from the Vaticancellars. \"The assertions,\" he says, \"which Mr. Thompson makes on the necessaryantagonism between the Catholic Church and free institutions, are characterizedby pitiful ignorance and blind audacity. He is reckless of logic, of history, ofcommon sense, of charity; and presents himself before the loyal American peopleas a narrow-minded bigot. No scholar would venture to repeat the stale calumnieswhich have so often been refuted. . . . In answer to his accusations against theChurch as the enemy of liberty, I tell him that, if ever this country shouldbecome a Catholic country, that is, if Catholics should ever be in the majority,and have the control of political power, then he would see the principles of ourConstitution carried out to the fullest extent; he would see that these Stateswould be in very deed United. He would behold a people living in peace andharmony; joined in the bonds of one faith, their hearts beating in unison withlove of their fatherland, with charity and forbearance toward all, andrespecting the rights and consciences even of their slanderers.\" In behalf of this \"Society of Jesus,\" he advises Mr. Thompson to send his bookto the Czar, Alexander II., and to Frederick William, Emperor of Germany. He mayexpect from them, as a token of their sympathy, the orders of St. Andrew and ofthe Black Eagle. \"From clear-minded, self-thinking, patriotic Americans, hecannot expect anything but the decoration of their contempt. As long as Americanhearts will beat in American bosoms, and the blood of their fathers shall flowin their veins, such efforts as Thompson's shall not succeed. True, genuineAmericans will protect the Catholic Church in this country and will finally joinit.\" After that, having thus, as he seems to think, left the corpse of hisimpious antagonist upon the field, he marches off emptying the dregs of hisexhausted bottle after the following fashion: \"We leave the volume, whoseargument we have killed, as a carcass to be devoured by those Texanbuzzards--those stinking birds--we mean that kind of men who love to feed oncorruption, calumnies, and lies, and are attracted by the stench of them.\" This last sentence is worthy to be added as an appendix to the Discorsi delSommo Pontifice Pio IX., by Don Pasquale di Franciscis, immortalized in thecontempt of Mr. Gladstone.--Tel maitre tel Valet! Moral: This will teach fair-minded, sober, and gentlemanly writers that even sowell-bred an antagonist as Mr. Thompson has shown himself in his book, cannothope to escape the only available weapon in the Catholic armory--Billingsgate.The whole argument of the author shows that while forcible, he intends to befair; but he might as well have attacked with a Tertullianistic violence, forhis treatment would not have been worse. It will doubtless afford him someconsolation to be placed in the same category with schismatic and infidelemperors and kings. While Americans, including Masons, are now warned to prepare themselves to jointhe Holy Apostolic and Roman Catholic Church, we are glad to know that there aresome as loyal and respected as any in Masonry who support our views. Conspicuousamong them is our venerable friend, Mr. Leon Hyneman, P. M., and a member of theGrand Lodge of Pennsylvania. For eight or nine years he was editor of theMasonic Mirror and Keystone, and is an author of repute. He assures uspersonally that for over thirty years he has combated the design to erect into aMasonic dogma, belief in a personal God. In his work, Ancient York and LondonGrand Lodges, he says (p. 169): \"Masonry, instead of unfolding professionallywith the intellectual advancement of scientific knowledge and generalintelligence, has departed from the original aims of the fraternity, and isapparently inclining towards a sectarian society. That is plainly to be seen . .. in the persistent determination not to expunge the sectarian innovationsinterpolated in the Ritual. . . . It would appear that the Masonic fraternity ofthis country are as indifferent to ancient landmarks and usages of Masonry, asthe Masons of the past century, under the London Grand Lodge were.\" It was thisconviction which prompted him, in 1856, when Jacques Etienne Marconis de Negre,Grand Hierophant of the Rite of Memphis, came to America and tendered him theGrand Mastership of the Rite in the United States, and the Ancient and AcceptedRite offered him an Honorary 33d--to refuse both. The Temple was the last European secret organization which, as a body, had inits possession some of the mysteries of the East. True, there were in the pastcentury (and perhaps still are) isolated \"Brothers\" faithfully and secretlyworking under the direction of Eastern Brotherhoods. But these, when they didbelong to European societies, invariably joined them for objects unknown to theFraternity, though at the same time for the benefit of the latter. It is throughthem that modern Masons have all they know of importance; and the similarity nowfound between the Speculative Rites of antiquity, the mysteries of the Essenes,Gnostics, and the Hindus, and the highest and oldest of the Masonic degrees wellprove the fact. If these mysterious brothers became possessed of the secrets ofthe societies, they could never reciprocate the confidence, though in theirhands these secrets were safer, perhaps, than in the keeping of European Masons.When certain of the latter were found worthy of becoming affiliates of theOrient, they were secretly instructed and initiated, but the others were nonethe wiser for that. No one could ever lay hands on the Rosicrucians, and notwithstanding the allegeddiscoveries of \"secret chambers,\" vellums called \"T,\" and of fossil knights withever-burning lamps, this ancient association and its true aims are to this day amystery. Pretended Templars and sham Rose-Croix, with a few genuine kabalists,were occasionally burned, and some unlucky Theosophists and alchemists soughtand put to the torture; delusive confessions even were wrung from them by themost ferocious means, but yet, the true Society remains to-day as it has everbeen, unknown to all, especially to its cruelest enemy--the Church. As to the modern Knights Templar and those Masonic Lodges which now claim adirect descent from the ancient Templars, their persecution by the Church was afarce from the beginning. They have not, nor have they ever had any secrets,dangerous to the Church. Quite the contrary; for we find J. G. Findel sayingthat the Scottish degrees, or the Templar system, only dates from 1735-1740, and\"following its Catholic tendency, took up its chief residence in the JesuitCollege of Clermont, in Paris, and hence was called the Clermont system.\" Thepresent Swedish system has also something of the Templar element in it, but freefrom Jesuits and interference with politics; however, it asserts that it hasMolay's Testament in the original, for a Count Beaujeu, a nephew of Molay, neverheard of elsewhere--says Findel--transplanted Templarism into Freemasonry, andthus procured for his uncle's ashes a mysterious sepulchre. It is sufficient toprove this a Masonic fable that on this pretended monument the day of Molay'sfuneral is represented as March 11, 1313, while the day of his death was March19, 1313. This spurious production, which is neither genuine Templarism, norgenuine Freemasonry, has never taken firm root in Germany. But the case isotherwise in France. Writing upon this subject, we must hear what Wilcke has to say of thesepretensions: \"The present Knight Templars of Paris will have it, that they are directdescendants from the ancient Knights, and endeavor to prove this by documents,interior regulations, and secret doctrines. Foraisse says the Fraternity ofFreemasons was founded in Egypt, Moses communicating the secret teaching to theIsraelites, Jesus to the Apostles, and thence it found its way to the KnightTemplars. Such inventions are necessary . . . to the assertion that the ParisianTemplars are the offspring of the ancient order. All these asseverations,unsupported by history, were fabricated in the High Chapter of Clermont(Jesuits), and preserved by the Parisian Templars as a legacy left them by thosepolitical revolutionists, the Stuarts and the Jesuits.\" Hence we find theBishops Gregoire * and Munter ** supporting them. Connecting the modern with the ancient Templars, we can at best, therefore,allow them an adoption of certain rites and ceremonies of purely ecclesiasticalcharacter after they had been cunningly inoculated into that grand and antiqueOrder by the clergy. Since this desecration, it gradually lost its primitive andsimple character, and went fast to its final ruin. Founded in 1118 by theKnights Hugh de Payens and Geoffrey de St. Omer, nominally for the protection ofthe pilgrims, its true aim was the restoration of the primitive secret worship.The true version of the history of Jesus, and the early Christianity wasimparted to Hugh de Payens, by the Grand-Pontiff of the Order of the Temple (ofthe Nazarene or Johanite sect), one named Theocletes, after which it was learnedby some Knights in Palestine, from the higher and more intellectual members ofthe St. John sect, who were initiated into its mysteries. * Freedom ofintellectual thought and the restoration of one and universal religion was theirsecret object. Sworn to the vow of obedience, poverty, and chastity, they wereat first the true Knights of John the Baptist, crying in the wilderness andliving on wild honey and locusts. Such is the tradition and the true kabalisticversion. It is a mistake to state that the Order became only later anti-Catholic. It wasso from the beginning, and the red cross on the white mantle, the vestment ofthe Order, had the same significance as with the initiates in every othercountry. It pointed to the four quarters of the compass, and was the emblem ofthe universe. ** When, later, the Brotherhood was transformed into a Lodge, theTemplars had, in order to avoid persecution, to perform their own ceremonies inthe greatest secresy, generally in the hall of the chapter, more frequently inisolated caves or country houses built amidst woods, while the ecclesiasticalform of worship was carried on publicly in the chapels belonging to the Order. Though of the accusations brought against them by order of Philip IV., many wereinfamously false, the main charges were certainly correct, from the stand-pointof what is considered by the Church, heresy. The present-day Templars, adheringstrictly as they do to the Bible, can hardly claim descent from those who didnot believe in Christ, as God-man, or as the Saviour of the world; who rejectedthe miracle of his birth, and those performed by himself; who did not believe intransubstantiation, the saints, holy relics, purgatory, etc. The Christ Jesuswas, in their opinion, a false prophet, but the man Jesus a Brother. Theyregarded John the Baptist as their patron, but never viewed him in the light inwhich he is presented in the Bible. They reverenced the doctrines of alchemy,astrology, magic, kabalistic talismans, and adhered to the secret teachings oftheir chiefs in the East. \"In the last century,\" says Findel, \"when Freemasonryerroneously supposed herself the daughter of Templarism, great pains were takento regard the Order of Knights-Templars as innocent. . . . For this purpose notonly legends and unrecorded events were fabricated, but pains were taken torepress the truth. The Masonic admirers of the Knights-Templars bought up thewhole of the documents of the lawsuit published by Moldenwaher, because theyproved the culpability of the Order.\" * This culpability consisted in their \"heresy\" against the Roman Catholic Church.While the real \"Brothers\" died an ignominious death, the spurious Order whichtried to step into their shoes became exclusively a branch of the Jesuits underthe immediate tutelage of the latter. True-hearted, honest Masons, ought toreject with horror any connection, let alone descent from these. \"The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem,\" writes Commander Gourdin, ** \"sometimescalled the Knights Hospitallers, and the Knights of Malta, were not Freemasons.On the contrary, they seem to have been inimical to Freemasonry, for in 1740,the Grand Master of the Order of Malta caused the Bull of Pope Clement XII. tobe published in that island, and forbade the meetings of the Freemasons. On thisoccasion several Knights and many citizens left the island; and in 1741, theInquisition persecuted the Freemasons at Malta. The Grand Master proscribedtheir assemblies under severe penalties, and six Knights were banished from theisland in perpetuity for having assisted at a meeting. In fact, unlike theTemplars, they had not even a secret form of reception. Reghellini says that hewas unable to procure a copy of the secret Ritual of the Knights of Malta. Thereason is obvious--there was none!\" And yet American Templarism comprises three degrees. 1, Knight of the Red Cross;2, Knight Templar; and 3, Knight of Malta. It was introduced from France intothe United States, in 1808, and the first Grand Encampment General was organizedon June 20, 1816, with Governor De Witt Clinton, of New York, as Grand Master. This inheritance of the Jesuits should hardly be boasted of. If the KnightsTemplar desire to make good their claims, they must choose between a descentfrom the \"heretical,\" anti-Christian, kabalistic, primitive Templars, or connectthemselves with the Jesuits, and nail their tesselated carpets directly on theplatform of ultra-Catholicism! Otherwise, their claims become a mere pretense. So impossible does it become for the originators of the ecclesiasticalpseudo-order of Templars, invented, according to Dupuy, in France, by theadherents of the Stuarts, to avoid being considered a branch of the Order of theJesuits, that we are not surprised to see an anonymous author, rightly suspectedof belonging to the Jesuit Chapter at Clermont, publishing a work in 1751, inBrussels, on the lawsuit of the Knights Templar. In this volume, in sundrymutilated notes, additions, and commentaries, he represents the innocence of theTemplars of the accusation of \"heresy,\" thus robbing them of the greatest titleto respect and admiration that these early free-thinkers and martyrs have won! This last pseudo-order was constituted at Paris, on the 4th of November, 1804,by virtue of a forged Constitution, and ever since it has \"contaminated genuineFreemasonry,\" as the highest Masons themselves tell us. La Charte detransmission (tabula aurea Larmenii) presents the outward appearance of suchextreme antiquity \"that Gregoire confesses that if all the other relics of theParisian treasury of the Order had not silenced his doubts as to their ancientdescent, the sight of this charter would at the very first glance have persuadedhim.\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_795] The first GrandMaster of this spurious Order was a physician of Paris, Dr. Fahre-Palaprat, whoassumed the name of Bernard Raymond. Count Ramsay, a Jesuit, was the first to start the idea of the Templars beingjoined to the Knights of Malta. Therefore, we read from his pen the following: \"Our forefathers (! ! !), the Crusaders, assembled in the Holy Land from allChristendom, wished to unite in a fraternity embracing all nations, that whenbound together, heart and soul, for mutual improvement, they might, in thecourse of time, represent one single intellectual people.\" This is why the Templars are made to join the St. John's Knights, and the lattergot into the craft of Masonry known as St. John's Masons. In the Sceau Rompu, in 1745, we find, therefore, the following most impudentfalsehood, worthy of the Sons of Loyola: \"The lodges were dedicated to St. John,because the Knights-Masons had in the holy wars in Palestine joined the Knightsof St. John.\" In 1743, the Kadosh degree was invented at Lyons (so writes Thory, at least),and \"it represents the revenge of the Templars.\" And here we find Findel sayingthat \"the Order of Knights Templars had been abolished in 1311, and to thatepoch they were obliged to have recourse when, after the banishment of severalKnights from Malta, in 1740, because they were Freemasons, it was no longerpossible to keep up a connection with the Order of St. John, or Knights ofMalta, then in the plenitude of their power under the sovereignty of the Pope.\" Turning to Clavel, one of the best Masonic authorities, we read: \"It is clearthat the erection of the French Order of the Knight Templars is not more ancientthan the year 1804, and that it cannot lay any legitimate claim to being thecontinuation of the so-called society of 'la petite Resurrection des Templiers,'nor this latter, either, extend back to the ancient Order of the KnightsTemplars.\" Therefore, we see these pseudo-Templars, under the guidance of theworthy Father Jesuits, forging in Paris, 1806, the famous charter of Larmenius.Twenty years later, this nefast and subterranean body, guiding the hand ofassassins, directed it toward one of the best and greatest princes in Europe,whose mysterious death, unfortunately for the interests of truth and justice,has never been--for political reasons--investigated and proclaimed to the worldas it ought to have been. It is this prince, a Freemason himself, who was thelast depository of the secrets of the true Knights Templar. For long centuriesthese had remained unknown and unsuspected. Holding their meetings once everythirteen years, at Malta, and their Grand Master advising the European brothersof the place of rendezvous but a few hours in advance, these representatives ofthe once mightiest and most glorious body of Knights assembled on the fixed day,from various points of the earth. Thirteen in number, in commemoration of theyear of the death of Jacques Molay (1313), the now Eastern brothers, among whomwere crowned heads, planned together the future religious and political fate ofthe nations; while the Popish Knights, their murderous and bastard successors,slept soundly in their beds, without a dream disturbing their guiltyconsciences. \"And yet,\" says Rebold, \"notwithstanding the confusion they had created(1736-72), the Jesuits had accomplished but one of their designs, viz.:denaturalyzing and bringing into disrepute the Masonic Institution. Havingsucceeded, as they believed, in destroying it in one form, they were determinedto use it in another. With this determination, they arranged the systems styled'Clerkship of the Templars,' an amalgamation of the different histories, events,and characteristics of the crusades mixed with the reveries of the alchemists.In this combination Catholicism governed all, and the whole fabrication movedupon wheels, representing the great object for which the Society of Jesus wasorganized.\" * Hence, the rites and symbols of Masonry which though \"Pagan\" in origin, are allapplied to and all flavor of Christianity. A Mason has to declare his belief ina personal God, Jehovah, and in the Encampment degrees also in Christ, before hecan be accepted in the Lodge, while the Johanite Templars believed in theunknown and invisible Principle, whence proceeded the Creative Powers misnamedgods, and held to the Nazarene version of Ben-Panther being the sinful father ofJesus, who thus proclaimed himself \"the son of god and of humanity.\" * This alsoaccounts for the fearful oaths of the Masons taken on the Bible, and for theirlectures servilely agreeing with the Patriarcho-Biblical Chronology. In theAmerican Order of Rose Croix, for instance, when the neophyte approaches thealtar, the \"Sir Knights are called to order, and the captain of the guard makeshis proclamation.\" \"To the glory of the sublime architect of the universe(Jehovah-Binah?), under the auspices of the Sovereign Sanctuary of Ancient andPrimitive Freemasonry,\" etc., etc. Then the Knight Orator strikes 1 and tellsthe neophyte that the antique legends of Masonry date back FORTY centuries;claiming no greater antiquity for the oldest of them than 622 A.M., at whichtime he says Noah was born. Under the circumstances this will be regarded as aliberal concession to chronological preferences. After that Masons ** areapprised that it was about the year 2188 B.C., that Mizraim led colonies intoEgypt, and laid the foundation of the Kingdom of Egypt, which kingdom lasted1,663 years (! ! !). Strange chronology, which, if it piously conforms with thatof the Bible, disagrees entirely with that of history. The mythical nine namesof the Deity, imported into Egypt, according to the Masons, only in thetwenty-second century B.C., are found on monuments reckoned twice as old by thebest Egyptologists. Nevertheless we must take at the same time intoconsideration, that the Masons are themselves ignorant of these names. The simple truth is that modern Masonry is a sadly different thing from what theonce universal secret fraternity was in the days when the Brahma-worshippers ofthe AUM, exchanged grips and passwords with the devotees of TUM, and the adeptsof every country under the sun were \"Brothers.\" What was then that mysterious name, that mighty \"word\" through whose potency theHindu as well as the Chaldean and Egyptian initiate performed his wonders? Inchapter cxv. of the Egyptian Funeral Ritual, entitled \"The chapter of coming outto the Heaven . . . and of knowing the Spirits of An\" (Heliopolis), Horus says:\"I knew the Spirits of An. The greatly glorious does not pass over it . . .unless the gods give me the WORD.\" In another hymn the soul, transformed,exclaims: \"Make road for me to Rusta. I am the Great One, dressed as the GreatOne. I have come! I have come! Delicious to me are the kings of Osiris. I amcreating the water (through the power of the Word). . . . Have I not seen thehidden secrets . . . I have given truth to the Sun. I am clear. I am adored formy purity\" (cxvii.--cxix. The chapters of the going into and coming out from theRusta). In another place the mummy's roll expresses the following: \"I am theGreat God (spirit) existing of myself, the creator of His Name. . . . I know thename of this Great God that is there.\" Jesus is accused by his enemies of having wrought miracles, and shown by his ownapostles to have expelled demons by the power of the INEFFABLE NAME. The formerfirmly believed that he had stolen it in the Sanctuary. \"And he cast the spiritswith his word . . . and healed all that were sick\" (Matthew xviii. 16). When theJewish rulers ask Peter (Acts iv. 7): \"By what power, or by what name, have yedone this?\" Peter replies, \"By the NAME of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.\" But doesthis mean the name of Christ, as the interpreters would make us believe; or doesit signify, \"'by the NAME which was in the possession of Jesus of Nazareth,\" theinitiate, who was accused by the Jews to have learned it but who had it reallythrough initiation? Besides, he states repeatedly that all that he does he doesin \"His Father's Name,\" not in his own. But who of the modern Masons has ever heard it pronounced? In their own Ritual,they confess that they never have. The \"Sir Orator\" tells the \"Sir Knight,\" thatthe passwords which he received in the preceding degrees are all \"so manycorruptions\" of the true name of God engraved on the triangle; and thattherefore they have adopted a \"substitute\" for it. Such also is the case in theBlue Lodge, where the Master, representing King Solomon, agrees with King Hiramthat the Word ****** \"shall be used as a substitute for the Master's word, untilwiser ages shall discover the true one.\" What Senior Deacon, of all thethousands who have assisted in bringing candidates from darkness to light; orwhat Master who has whispered this mystic \"word\" into the ears of supposititiousHiram Abiffs, while holding them on the five points of fellowship, has suspectedthe real meaning of even this substitute, which they impart \"at low breath\"? Howfew new-made Master Masons but go away imagining that it has some occultconnection with the \"marrow in the bone.\" What do they know of that mysticalpersonage known to some adepts as the \"venerable MAH,\" or of the mysteriousEastern Brothers who obey him, whose name is abbreviated in the first syllableof the three which compose the Masonic substitute--The MAH, who lives at thisvery day in a spot unknown to all but initiates, and the approaches to which arethrough trackless wildernesses, untrodden by Jesuit or missionary foot, for itis beset by dangers fit to appall the most courageous explorers? And yet, forgenerations this meaningless jingle of vowels and consonants has been repeatedin noviciate ears, as though it possessed even so much potency as would deflectfrom its course a thistledown floating in the air! Like Christianity,Freemasonry is a corpse from which the spirit long ago fled. In this connection, place may well be given to a letter from Mr. CharlesSotheran, Corresponding Secretary of the New York Liberal Club, which wasreceived by us on the day after the date it bears. Mr. Sotheran is known as awriter and lecturer on antiquarian, mystical, and other subjects. In Masonry, hehas taken so many of the degrees as to be a competent authority as regards theCraft. He is 32 [images/00074.jpg]A. and P. R., and P. R., 94[images/00074.jpg]Memphis, K. R [images/00075.jpg], K. Kadosh, M. M. 104, Eng.,etc. He is also an initiate of the modern English Brotherhood of the Rosie Crossand other secret societies, and Masonic editor of the New York Advocate.Following is the letter, which we place before the Masons as we desire that theyshould see what one of their own number has to say: \"NEW YORK PRESS CLUB, January 11th, 1877.\"In response to your letter, I willingly furnish the information desired withrespect to the antiquity and present condition of Freemasonry. This I do themore cheerfully since we belong to the same secret societies, and you can thusbetter appreciate the necessity for the reserve which at times I shall beobliged to exhibit. You rightly refer to the fact that Freemasonry, no less thanthe effete theologies of the day, has its fabulous history to narrate. Cloggedup as the Order has been by the rubbish and drift of absurd biblical legends, itis no wonder that its usefulness has been impaired and its work as a civilizerhampered. Fortunately the great anti-Masonic excitement that raged in the UnitedStates during a portion of this century, forced a considerable band of workersto delve into the true origin of the Craft, and bring about a healthier state ofthings. The agitation in America also spread to Europe and the literary effortsof Masonic authors on both sides of the Atlantic, such as Rebold, Findel,Hyneman, Mitchell, Mackenzie, Hughan, Yarker and others well-known to thefraternity, is now a matter of history. One effect of their labors has been, ina great measure, to bring the history of Masonry into an open daylight, whereeven its teachings, jurisprudence, and ritual are no longer secret from those ofthe 'profane,' who have the wit to read as they run.\"You are correct in saying that the Bible is the 'great light' of European andAmerican Masonry. In consequence of this the theistic conception of God and thebiblical cosmogony have been ever considered two of its great corner-stones. Itschronology seems also to have been based upon the same pseudo-revelation. ThusDr. Dalcho, in one of his treatises asserts that the principles of the MasonicOrder were presented at and coeval with the creation. It is therefore notastonishing that such a pundit should go on to state that God was the firstGrand Master, Adam the second, and the last named initiated Eve into the GreatMystery, as I suppose many a Priestess of Cybele and 'Lady' Kadosh wereafterward. The Rev. Dr. Oliver, another Masonic authority, gravely records whatmay be termed the minutes of a Lodge where Moses presided as Grand Master,Joshua as Deputy Grand Master, and Aholiab and Bezaleel as Grand Wardens! Thetemple at Jerusalem, which recent archaeologists have shown to be a structurewith nothing like the pretended antiquity of its erection, and incorrectlycalled after a monarch whose name proves his mystical character, Sol-Om-On (thename of the sun in three languages), plays, as you correctly observe, aconsiderable share in Masonic mystery. Such fables as these, and the traditionalMasonic colonization of ancient Egypt, have given the Craft the credit of anillustrious origin to which it has no right, and before whose forty centuries oflegendary history, the mythologies of Greece and Rome fade into insignificance.The Egyptian, Chaldean, and other theories necessary to each fabricator of 'highdegrees' have also each had their short period of prominence. The last 'axe togrind' has consecutively been the fruitful mother of unproductiveness.\"We both agree that all the ancient priesthoods had their esoteric doctrines andsecret ceremonies. From the Essenic brotherhood, an evolution of the HinduGymnosophists, doubtless proceeded the Solidarities of Greece and Rome asdescribed by so-called 'Pagan' writers. Founded on these and copying them in thematter of ritual, signs, grips, passwords, etc., were developed the mediaevalguilds. Like the present livery companies of London, the relics of the Englishtrade-guilds, the operative Masons were but a guild of workmen with higherpretensions. From the French name 'Macon,' derived from 'Mas,' an old Normannoun meaning 'a house,' comes our English 'Mason,' a house builder. As theLondon companies alluded to present now and again the Freedom of the 'Liveries'to outsiders, so we find the trade-guilds of Masons doing the same. Thus thefounder of the Ashmolean Museum was made free of the Masons at Warrington, inLancashire, England, on the 16th October, 1646. The entrance of such men asElias Ashmole into the Operative Fraternity paved the way for the great 'MasonicRevolution of 1717,' when SPECULATIVE Masonry came into existence. TheConstitutions of 1723 and 1738, by the Masonic impostor Anderson, were writtenup for the newly-fledged and first Grand Lodge of 'Free and Accepted Masons' ofEngland, from which body all others over the world hail to-day.\"These bogus constitutions, written by Anderson, were compiled about then, andin order to palm off his miserable rubbish yclept history, on the Craft, he hadthe audacity to state that nearly all the documents relating to Masonry inEngland had been destroyed by the 1717 reformers. Happily, in the BritishMuseum, Bodleian Library, and other public institutions, Rebold, Hughan andothers have discovered sufficient evidence in the shape of old Operative Masoniccharges to disprove this statement.\"The same writers, I think, have conclusively upset the tenability of two otherdocuments palmed upon Masonry, namely, the spurious charter of Cologne of 1535,and the forged questions, supposed to have been written by Leylande, theantiquary, from a MS. of King Henry VI. of England. In the last named,Pythagoras is referred to as having--'formed a great lodge, at Crotona, and mademany Masons, some of whom travelled into France, and there made many, fromwhence, in process of time, the art passed into England.' Sir Christopher Wren,architect of St. Paul's Cathedral, London, often called the 'Grand Master ofFreemasons,' was simply the Master or President of the London Operative MasonsCompany. If such a tissue of fable could interweave itself into the history ofthe Grand Lodges which now have charge of the first three symbolical degrees, itis hardly astonishing that the same fate should befall nearly all of the HighMasonic Degrees which have been aptly termed 'an incoherent medley of oppositeprinciples.'\"It is curious to note too that most of the bodies which work these, such as theAncient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the Rite of Avignon, the Order of theTemple, Fessler's Rite, the 'Grand Council of the Emperors of the East andWest--Sovereign Prince Masons,' etc., etc., are nearly all the offspring of thesons of Ignatius Loyola. The Baron Hundt, Chevalier Ramsay, Tschoudy,Zinnendorf, and numerous others who founded the grades in these rites, workedunder instructions from the General of the Jesuits. The nest where these highdegrees were hatched, and no Masonic rite is free from their baleful influencemore or less, was the Jesuit College of Clermont at Paris.\"That bastard foundling of Freemasonry, the 'Ancient and Accepted ScottishRite,' which is unrecognized by the Blue Lodges was the enunciation, primarily,of the brain of the Jesuit Chevalier Ramsay. It was brought by him to England in1736-38, to aid the cause of the Catholic Stuarts. The rite in its present formof thirty-three degrees was reorganized at the end of the eighteenth century bysome half dozen Masonic adventurers at Charleston, South Carolina. Two of these,Pirlet a tailor, and a dancing master named Lacorne, were fitting predecessorsfor a later resuscitation by a gentleman of the name of Gourgas, employed in thearistocratic occupation of a ship's clerk, on a boat trading between New Yorkand Liverpool. Dr. Crucefix, alias Goss, the inventor of certain patentmedicines of an objectionable character, ran the institution in England. Thepowers under which these worthies acted was a document claimed to have beensigned by Frederick the Great at Berlin, on May 1st, 1786, and by which wererevised the Masonic Constitution and Status of the High Degrees of the Ancientand Accepted Rite. This paper was an impudent forgery and necessitated theissuing of a protocol by the Grand Lodges of the Three Globes of Berlin, whichconclusively proved the whole arrangement to be false in every particular. Onclaims supported by this supposititious document, the Ancient and Accepted Ritehave swindled their confiding brothers in the Americas and Europe out ofthousands of dollars, to the shame and discredit of humanity.\"The modern Templars, whom you refer to in your letter, are but mere magpies inpeacock's plumes. The aim of the Masonic Templars is the sectarianization, orrather the Christianizing of Masonry, a fraternity which is supposed to admitthe Jew, Parsee, Mahometan, Buddhist, in fact every religionist within itsportals who accepts the doctrine of a personal god, and spirit-immortality.According to the belief of a section, if not all the Israelites, belonging tothe Craft in America--Templarism is Jesuitism.\"It seems strange, now that the belief in a personal God is becoming extinct,and that even the theologian has transformed his deity into an indescribablenondescript, that there are those who stand in the way of the generalacceptation of the sublime pantheism of the primeval Orientals, of Jacob Boehme,of Spinoza. Often in the Grand Lodge and subordinate lodges of this and otherjurisdictions, the old doxology is sung, with its 'Praise Father, Son, and HolyGhost,' to the disgust of Israelites and free-thinking brethren, who are thusunnecessarily insulted. This could never occur in India, where the great lightin a lodge may be the Koran, the Zend-Avesta, or one of the Vedas. The sectarianChristian spirit in Masonry must be put down. To-day there are German GrandLodges which will not allow Jews to be initiated, or Israelites from foreigncountries to be accepted as brethren within their jurisdiction. The FrenchMasons have, however, revolted against this tyranny, and the Grand Orient ofFrance does now permit the atheist and materialist to fellowship in the Craft. Astanding rebuke upon the claimed universality of Masonry is the fact that theFrench brethren are now repudiated.\"Notwithstanding its many faults--and speculative Masonry is but human, andtherefore fallible--there is no institution that has done so much, and is yetcapable of such great undertakings in the future, for human, religious, andpolitical improvement. In the last century the Illuminati taught, 'peace withthe cottage, war with the palace,' throughout the length and breadth of Europe.In the last century the United States was freed from the tyranny of the mothercountry by the action of the Secret Societies more than is commonly imagined.Washington, Lafayette, Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, were Masons. And in thenineteenth century it was Grand Master Garibaldi, 33, who unified Italy, workingin accordance with the spirit of the faithful brotherhood, as the Masonic, orrather carbonari, principles of 'liberty, equality, humanity, independence,unity,' taught for years by brother Joseph Mazzini.\"Speculative Masonry has much, too, within its ranks to do. One is to acceptwoman as a co-worker of man in the struggle of life, as the Hungarian Masonshave done lately by initiating the Countess Haideck. Another important thing isalso to recognize practically the brotherhood of all humanity by refusing noneon account of color, race, position, or creed. The dark-skinned should not beonly theoretically the brother of the light. The colored Masons who have beenduly and regularly raised stand at every lodge-door in America cravingadmission, and they are refused. And there is South America to be conquered to aparticipation in the duties of humanity.\"If Masonry be, as claimed, a progressive science and a school of pure religion,it should ever be found in the advance guard of civilization, not in the rear.If it be but an empirical effort, a crude attempt of humanity to solve some ofthe deepest problems of the race, and no more, then it must give place to fittersuccessors, perchance one of those that you and I know of, one that may haveacted the prompter at the side of the chiefs of the Order, during its greatesttriumphs, whispering to them as the daemon did in the ear of Socrates.\"Yours most Sincerely,\"CHARLES SOTHERAN.\"Thus falls to ruins the grand epic poem of Masons, sung by so many mysteriousKnights as another revealed gospel. As we see, the Temple of Solomon is beingundermined and brought to the ground by its own chief \"Master Masons,\" of thiscentury. But if, following the ingenious exoteric description of the Bible,there are yet Masons who persist in regarding it as once an actual structure,who, of the students of the esoteric doctrine will ever consider this mythictemple otherwise than an allegory, embodying the secret science? Whether or notthere ever was a real temple of that name, we may well leave to archaeologiststo decide; but that the detailed description thereof in 1 Kings is purelyallegorical, no serious scholar, proficient in the ancient as well as mediaevaljargon of the kabalists and alchemists, can doubt. The building of the Temple ofSolomon is the symbolical representation of the gradual acquirement of thesecret wisdom, or magic; the erection and development of the spiritual from theearthly; the manifestation of the power and splendor of the spirit in thephysical world, through the wisdom and genius of the builder. The latter, whenhe has become an adept, is a mightier king than Solomon himself, the emblem ofthe sun or Light himself--the light of the real subjective world, shining in thedarkness of the objective universe. This is the \"Temple\" which can be rearedwithout the sound of the hammer, or any tool of iron being heard in the housewhile it is \"in building.\" In the East, this science is called, in some places, the \"seven-storied,\" inothers, the \"nine-storied\" Temple; every story answers allegorically to a degreeof knowledge acquired. Throughout the countries of the Orient, wherever magicand the wisdom-religion are studied, its practitioners and students are knownamong their craft as Builders--for they build the temple of knowledge, of secretscience. Those of the adepts who are active, are styled practical or operativeBuilders, while the students, or neophytes are classed as speculative ortheoretical. The former exemplify in works their control over the forces ofinanimate as well as animate nature; the latter are but perfecting themselves inthe rudiments of the sacred science. These terms were evidently borrowed at thebeginning by the unknown founders of the first Masonic guilds. In the now popular jargon, \"Operative Masons\" are understood to be thebricklayers and the handicraftsmen, who composed the Craft down to SirChristopher Wren's time; and \"Speculative Masons,\" all members of the Order, asnow understood. The sentence attributed to Jesus, \"Thou art Peter . . . uponthis rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevailagainst it,\" disfigured, as it is, by mistranslation and misinterpretation,plainly indicates its real meaning. We have shown the signification of Pater andPetra, with the hierophants--the interpretation traced on the tables of stone ofthe final initiation, was handed by the initiator to the chosen futureinterpreter. Having acquainted himself with its mysterious contents, whichrevealed to him the mysteries of creation, the initiated became a builderhimself, for he was made acquainted with the dodecahedron, or the geometricalfigure on which the universe was built. To what he had learned in previousinitiations of the use of the rule and of architectural principles, was added across, the perpendicular and horizontal lines of which were supposed to form thefoundation of the spiritual temple, by placing them across the junction, orcentral primordial point, the element of all existences, * representing thefirst concrete idea of deity. Henceforth he could, as a Master builder (see 1Corinthians, iii. 10), erect a temple of wisdom on that rock of Petra, forhimself; and having laid a sure foundation, let \"another build thereon.\" The Egyptian hierophant was given a square head-dress, which he had to wearalways, and a square (see Mason's marks), without which he could never goabroad. The perfect Tau formed of the perpendicular (descending male ray, orspirit) a horizontal line (or matter, female ray), and the mundane circle was anattribute of Isis, and, it is but at his death that the Egyptian cross was laidon the breast of his mummy. These square hats are worn unto this day by theArmenian priests. The claim that the cross is purely a Christian symbolintroduced after our era, is strange indeed, when we find Ezekiel stamping theforeheads of the men of Judah, who feared the Lord (Ezekiel ix. 4), with thesigna Thau, as it is translated in the Vulgate. In the ancient Hebrew this signwas formed thus [images/00076.jpg]but in the original Egyptian hieroglyphics asa perfect Christian cross [images/00077.jpg]. In the Revelation, also, the\"Alpha and Omega\" (spirit and matter), the first and the last, stamps the nameof his Father in the foreheads of the elect. And if our statements are wrong, if Jesus was not an initiate, a Master-builder,or Master-Mason as it is now called, how comes it, that on the most ancientcathedrals we find his figure with Mason's marks about his person? In theCathedral of Santa Croce, Florence, over the main portal can be seen the figureof Christ holding a perfect square in his hand. The surviving \"Master-builders\" of the operative craft of the true Temple, maygo literally half-naked and wander slipshod for ever--now not for the sake of apuerile ceremony, but because, like the \"Son of man,\" they have not where to laytheir heads--and yet be the only surviving possessors of the \"Word.\" Their\"cable-tow\" is the sacred triple cord of certain Brahman-Sannyasi, or the stringon which certain lamas hang their yu-stone; but with these apparently valuelesstalismans, not one of them would part for all the wealth of Solomon and Sheba.The seven-knotted bamboo stick of the fakir can become as powerful as the rod ofMoses \"which was created between the evenings, and on which was engraven and setforth the great and glorious NAME, with which he was to do the wonders inMizraim.\" But these \"operative workmen\" have no fear that their secrets will be disclosedby treacherous ex-high priests of chapters, though their generation may havereceived them through others than \"Moses, Solomon, and Zerubbabel.\" Had MosesMichael Hayes, the Israelite Brother who introduced Royal Arch Masonry into thiscountry (in December, 1778), *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_800] had a propheticpresentiment of future treasons, he might have instituted more efficaciousobligations than he has. Truly, the grand omnific Royal Arch word, \"long lost but now found,\" hasfulfilled its prophetic promise. The password of that degree is no more \"I AMTHAT I AM.\" It is now simply \"I was but am no more!\" [images/00078.jpg] That we may not be accused of vain boasting, we shall give the keys to severalof the secret ciphers of the most exclusive and important of the so-calledhigher Masonic degrees. If we mistake not, these have never before been revealedto the outside world (except that of the Royal Arch Masons, in 1830), but havebeen most jealously guarded within the various Orders. We are under neitherpromise, obligation, nor oath; and therefore violate no confidence. Our purposeis not to gratify an idle curiosity; we wish merely to show Masons and theaffiliates of all other Western societies--the Company of Jesus included--thatit is impossible for them to be secure in the possession of any secrets that itis worth an Eastern Brotherhood's while to discover. Inferentially, it may alsoshow them that if the latter can lift the masks of European societies, they arenevertheless successful in wearing their own visors; for, if any one thing isuniversally acknowledged, it is that the real secrets of not a single survivingancient brotherhood are in possession of the profane. Some of these ciphers were used by the Jesuits in their secret correspondence atthe time of the Jacobin conspiracy, and when Masonry (the alleged successor tothe Temple) was employed by the Church for political purposes. Findel says (see his History of Freemasonry, p. 253) that in the eighteenthcentury, \"besides the modern Knights Templar, we see the Jesuits . . .disfiguring the fair face of Freemasonry. Many Masonic authors, who were fullycognizant of the period, and knew exactly all the incidents occurring,positively assert that then and still later the Jesuits exercised a perniciousinfluence, or at least endeavored to do so, upon the fraternity.\" Of theRosicrucian Order he remarks, upon the authority of Prof. Woog, that its \"aim atfirst . . . was nothing less than the support and advancement of Catholicism.When this religion manifested a determination entirely to repress liberty ofthought . . . the Rosicrucians enlarged their designs likewise to check, ifpossible, the progress of this widely-spreading enlightenment.\" In the Sincerus Renatus (the truly converted) of S. Richter, of Berlin (1714),we note that laws were communicated for the government of the \"GoldenRosicrucians,\" which \"bear unmistakable evidences of Jesuitical intervention.\" We will begin with the cryptographs of the \"Sovereign Princes Rose Croix,\" alsostyled Knights of St. Andrew, Knights of the Eagle and Pelican, Heredom, RosaeCrucis, Rosy Cross, Triple Cross, Perfect Brother, Prince Mason, and so on. The\"Heredom Rosy Cross\" also claims a Templar origin, in 1314. * [images/00079.jpg] The Knights Kadosh have another cipher--or rather hieroglyph--which, in thiscase, is taken from the Hebrew, possibly to be the more in keeping with theBible Kadeshim of the Temple. * [images/00080.jpg] As for the Royal Arch cipher, it has been exposed before now, but we may as wellpresent it slightly amplified. This cipher consists of certain combinations of right angles, with or withoutpoints or dots. Following is the basis of its Formation. [images/00081.jpg] Now, the alphabet consists of twenty-six letters, and these two signs beingdissected, form thirteen distinct characters, thus: [images/00082.jpg] Let this suffice. We might, if we chose, give the cipher alphabets with theirkeys, of another method of the Royal Arch Masons, strongly resembling a certainHindu character; of the G [images/00074.jpg]El [images/00074.jpg]of the MysticCity; of a well-known form of the Devanagari script of the (French) Sages of thePyramids; and of the Sublime Master of the Great Work, and others. But werefrain; only, be it understood, for the reason that some of these alone of allthe side branches of the original Blue Lodge Freemasonry, contain the promise ofa useful future. As for the rest, they may and will go to the ash-heap of time.High Masons will understand what we mean. We must now give some proofs of what we have stated, and demonstrate that theword Jehovah, if Masonry adheres to it, will ever remain as a substitute, neverbe identical with the lost mirific name. This is so well known to the kabalists,that in their careful etymology of the [images/00024.jpg]they show it beyonddoubt to be only one of the many substitutes for the real name, and composed ofthe two-fold name of the first androgyne--Adam and Eve, Jod (or Yodh), Vau andHe-Va--the female serpent as a symbol of Divine Intelligence proceeding from theONE-Generative or Creative Spirit. * Thus, Jehovah is not the sacred name atall. Had Moses given to Pharaoh the true \"name,\" the latter would not haveanswered as he did, for the Egyptian King-Initiates knew it as well as Moses,who had learned it with them. The \"name\" was at that time the common property ofthe adepts of all the nations in the world, and Pharaoh knew certainly the\"name\" of the Highest God mentioned in the Book of the Dead. But instead ofthat, Moses (if we accept the allegory of Exodus literally), gives Pharaoh thename of Yeva, the expression or form of the Divine name used by all the Targumsas passed by Moses. Hence Pharaoh's reply: \"And who is that Yeva ** that Ishould obey his voice?\" \"Jehovah\" dates only from the Masoretic innovation. When the Rabbis, for fearthat they should lose the keys to their own doctrines, then written exclusivelyin consonants, began to insert their vowel-points in their manuscripts, theywere utterly ignorant of the true pronunciation of the NAME. Hence, they gave itthe sound of Adonah, and made it read Ja-ho-vah. Thus the latter is simply afancy, a perversion of the Holy Name. And how could they know it? Alone, out ofall their nation the high priests had it in their possession, and respectivelypassed it to their successors, as the Hindu Brahmatma does before his death.Once a year only, on the day of atonement, the high priest was allowed topronounce it in a whisper. Passing behind the veil into the inner chamber of thesanctuary, the Holy of Holies, with trembling lips and downcast eyes he calledupon the dreaded NAME. The bitter persecution of the kabalists, who received theprecious syllables after deserving the favor by a whole life of sanctity, wasdue to a suspicion that they misused it. At the opening of this chapter we havetold the story of Simeon Ben-Iochai, one of the victims to this pricelessknowledge, and see how little he deserved his cruel treatment. The Book of Jasher, a work--as we are told by a very learned Hebrew divine, ofNew York--composed in Spain in the twelfth century as \"a popular tale,\" and thathad not \"the sanction of the Rabbinical College of Venice,\" is full ofkabalistical, alchemical, and magical allegories. Admitting so much, it muststill be said that there are few popular tales but are based on historicaltruths. The Norsemen in Iceland, by Dr. G. W. Dasent, is also a collection ofpopular tales, but they contain the key to the primitive religious worship ofthat people. So with the Book of Jasher. It contains the whole of the OldTestament in a condensed form, and as the Samaritans held, i.e., the five Booksof Moses, without the Prophets. Although rejected by the orthodox Rabbis, wecannot help thinking that, as in the case of the apocryphal Gospels, which werewritten earlier than the canonical ones, the Book of Jasher is the true originalfrom which the subsequent Bible was in part composed. Both the apocryphalGospels and Jasher, are a series of religious tales, in which miracle is heapedupon miracle, and which narrate the popular legends as they first originated,without any regard to either chronology or dogma. Still both are corner-stonesof the Mosaic and Christian religions. That there was a Book of Jasher prior tothe Mosaic Pentateuch is clear, for it is mentioned in Joshua, Isaiah, and 2Samuel. Nowhere is the difference between the Elohists and Jehovists so clearly shown asin Jasher. Jehovah is here spoken of as the Ophites held him to be, a Son ofIlda-Baoth, or Saturn. In this Book, the Egyptian Magi, when asked by Pharaoh\"Who is he, of whom Moses speaks as the I am?\" reply that the God of Moses \"wehave learned, is the Son of the Wise, the Son of ancient kings\" (ch. lxxix.45). * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_805] Now, those whoassert that Jasher is a forgery of the twelfth century--and we readily believeit--should nevertheless explain the curious fact that, while the above text isnot to be found in the Bible, the answer to it is, and is, moreover, couched inunequivocal terms. At Isaiah xix. 11, the \"Lord God\" complains of it verywrathfully to the prophet, and says: \"Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, thecounsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish; how say ye untoPharaoh, I am the Son of the Wise, the Son of ancient kings?\" which is evidentlya reply to the above. At Joshua x. 13, Jasher is referred to in corroboration ofthe outrageous assertion that the sun stood still, and the moon stayed until thepeople had avenged themselves. \"Is not this written in the Book of Jasher?\" saysthe text. And at 2 Samuel, i. 19, the same book is again quoted. \"Behold,\" itsays, \"it is written in the Book of Jasher.\" Clearly, Jasher must have existed;it must have been regarded as authority; must have been older than Joshua; and,since the verse in Isaiah unerringly points to the passage above quoted, we haveat least as much reason to accept the current edition of Jasher as atranscription, excerpt, or compilation of the original work, as we have torevere the Septuagint Pentateuch, as the primitive Hebraic sacred records. At all events, Jehovah is not the ancient of the ancient, or \"aged of the aged,\"of the Sohar; for we find him, in this book, counselling with God the Father asto the creation of the world. \"The work-master spoke to the Lord. Let us makeman after our image\" (Sohar i., fol. 25). Jehovah is but the Metatron, andperhaps, not even the highest, but only one of the AEons; for he whom Onkeloscalls Memro, the \"Word,\" is not the exoteric Jehovah of the Bible, nor is heJahve [images/00083.jpg]the Existing One. It was the secresy of the early kabalists, who were anxious to screen the realMystery name of the \"Eternal\" from profanation, and later the prudence which themediaeval alchemists and occultists were compelled to adopt to save their lives,that caused the inextricable confusion of divine names. This is what led thepeople to accept the Jehovah of the Bible as the name of the \"One living God.\"Every Jewish elder, prophet, and other man of any importance knew thedifference; but as the difference lay in the vocalization of the \"name,\" and itsright pronunciation led to death, the common people were ignorant of it, for noinitiate would risk his life by teaching it to them. Thus the Sinaitic deitycame gradually to be regarded as identical with \"Him whose name is known but tothe wise.\" When Capellus translates: \"Whosoever shall pronounce the name ofJehovah, shall suffer death,\" he makes two mistakes. The first is in adding thefinal letter h to the name, if he wants this deity to be considered either maleor androgynous, for the letter makes the name feminine, as it really should be,considering it is one of the names of Binah, the third emanation; his seconderror is in asserting that the word nokeb means only to pronounce distinctly. Itmeans to pronounce correctly. Therefore, the biblical name Jehovah may be considered simply a substitute,which, as belonging to one of the \"powers\" got to be viewed as that of the\"Eternal.\" There is an evident mistake (one of the very many), in one of thetexts in Leviticus, which has been corrected by Cahen, and which proves that theinterdiction did not at all concern the name of the exoteric Jehovah, whosenumerous other names could also be pronounced without any penalty beingincurred. * In the vicious English version, the translation runs thus: \"And hethat blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall surely be put to death,\" Levit.xxiv. 16. Cahen renders it far more correctly, thus: \"And he that blasphemeththe name of the Eternal shall die,\" etc. The \"Eternal\" being something higherthan the exoteric and personal \"Lord.\" ** As with the Gentile nations, the symbols of the Israelites were ever bearing,directly or indirectly, upon sun-worship. The exoteric Jehovah of the Bible is adual god, like all the other gods; and the fact that David--who is entirelyignorant of Moses--praises his \"Lord,\" and assures him that the \"Lord is a greatGod, and a great King above all gods,\" may be of a very great importance to thedescendants of Jacob and David, but their national God concerns us in no wise.We are quite ready to show the \"Lord God\" of Israel the same respect as we do toBrahma, Zeus, or any other secondary deity. But we decline, most emphatically,to recognize in him either the Deity worshipped by Moses, or the \"Father\" ofJesus, or yet the \"Ineffable Name\" of the kabalists. Jehovah is, perhaps, one ofthe Elohim, who was concerned in the formation (which is not creation) of theuniverse, one of the architects who built from pre-existing matter, but he neverwas the \"Unknowable\" Cause that created \"bara,\" in the night of the Eternity.These Elohim first form and bless; then they curse and destroy; as one of thesePowers, Jehovah is therefore by turns beneficent and malevolent; at one momenthe punishes and then repents. He is the antitype of several of thepatriarchs--of Esau and of Jacob, the allegorical twins, emblems of the evermanifest dual principle in nature. So Jacob, who is Israel, is the leftpillar--the feminine principle of Esau, who is the right pillar and the maleprinciple. When he wrestles with Malach-Iho, the Lord, it is the latter whobecomes the right pillar, and Jacob-Israel names God; although theBible-interpreters have endeavored to transform him into a mere \"angel of theLord\" (Genesis xxxii.), Jacob conquers him--as matter will but too often conquerspirit--but his thigh is put out of joint in the fight. The name of Israel has its derivation from Isaral or Asar, the Sun-God, who isknown as Suryal, Surya, and Sur. Isra-el means \"striving with God.\" The \"sunrising upon Jacob-Israel,\" is the Sun-God Isaral, fecundating matter or earth,represented by the female-Jacob. As usual, the allegory has more than one hiddenmeaning in the Kabala. Esau, AEsaou, Asu, is also the sun. Like the \"Lord,\" Esaufights with Jacob and prevails not. The God-Sun first strives against, and thenrises on him in covenant. \"And as he passed over Penuel, the sun rose upon him, and he (Jacob) halted uponhis thigh\" (Genesis xxxii. 31). Israel Jacob, opposed by his brother Esau, isSamael, and \"the names of Samael are Azazel and Satan\" (the opposer). If it will be argued that Moses was unacquainted with the Hindu philosophy and,therefore, could not have taken Siva, the regenerator and the destroyer, as hismodel for Jehovah, then we must admit that there was some miraculousinternational intuition which prompted every nation to choose for its exotericnational deity the dual type we find in the \"Lord God\" of Israel. All thesefables speak for themselves. Siva, Jehovah, Osiris, are all the symbols of theactive principle in nature par excellence. They are the forces which preside atthe formation or regeneration of matter and its destruction. They are the typesof Life and Death, ever fecundating and decomposing under the never-ceasinginflux of the anima mundi, the Universal intellectual Soul, the invisible butever-present spirit which is behind the correlation of the blind forces. Thisspirit alone is immutable, and therefore the forces of the universe, cause andeffect, are ever in perfect harmony with this one great Immutable Law. SpiritualLife is the one primordial principle above; Physical Life is the primordialprinciple below, but they are one under their dual aspect. When the Spirit iscompletely untrammelled from the fetters of correlation, and its essence hasbecome so purified as to be re-united with its CAUSE, it may--and yet who cantell whether it really will--have a glimpse of the Eternal Truth. Till then, letus not build ourselves idols in our own image, and accept the shadows for theEternal Light. The greatest mistake of the age was to attempt a comparison of the relativemerits of all the ancient religions, and scoff at the doctrines of the Kabalaand other superstitions. But truth is stranger than fiction; and this world-old adage finds itsapplication in the case in hand. The \"wisdom\" of the archaic ages or the \"secretdoctrine\" embodied in the Oriental Kabala, of which, as we have said, theRabbinical is but an abridgment, did not die out with the Philaletheans of thelast Eclectic school. The Gnosis lingers still on earth, and its votaries aremany, albeit unknown. Such secret brotherhoods have been mentioned beforeMackenzie's time, by more than one great author. If they have been regarded asmere fictions of the novelist, that fact has only helped the \"brother-adepts\" tokeep their incognito the more easily. We have personally known several of themwho, to their great merriment had had the story of their lodges, the communitiesin which they lived, and the wondrous powers which they had exercised for manylong years, laughed at and denied by unsuspecting skeptics to their very faces.Some of these brothers belong to the small groups of \"travellers.\" Until theclose of the happy Louis-Philippian reign, they were pompously termed by theParisian garcon and trader the nobles etrangers, and as innocently believed tobe \"Boyards,\" Valachian \"Gospodars,\" Indian \"Nabobs,\" and Hungarian \"Margraves,\"who had gathered at the capital of the civilized world to admire its monumentsand partake of its dissipations. There are, however, some insane enough toconnect the presence of certain of these mysterious guests in Paris with thegreat political events that subsequently took place. Such recall at least asvery remarkable coincidences, the breaking out of the Revolution of '93, and theearlier explosion of the South Sea Bubble, soon after the appearance of \"nobleforeigners,\" who had convulsed all Paris for more or less longer periods, byeither their mystical doctrines or \"supernatural gifts.\" The St. Germains andCagliostros of this century, having learned bitter lessons from thevilifications and persecutions of the past, pursue different tactics now-a-days. But there are numbers of these mystic brotherhoods which have naught to do with\"civilized\" countries; and it is in their unknown communities that are concealedthe skeletons of the past. These \"adepts\" could, if they chose, lay claim tostrange ancestry, and exhibit verifiable documents that would explain many amysterious page in both sacred and profane history. Had the keys to the hieraticwritings and the secret of Egyptian and Hindu symbolism been known to theChristian Fathers, they would not have allowed a single monument of old to standunmutilated. And yet, if we are well informed--and we think we are--there wasnot one such in all Egypt, but the secret records of its hieroglyphics werecarefully registered by the sacerdotal caste. These records still exist, though\"not extant\" for the general public, though perhaps the monuments may havepassed away for ever out of human sight. Of forty-seven tombs of the kings, near Gornore, recorded by the Egyptianpriests on their sacred registers, only seventeen were known to the public,according to Diodorus Siculus, who visited the place about sixty years B.C.Notwithstanding this historical evidence, we assert that the whole number existto this day, and the royal tomb discovered by Belzoni among the sandstonemountains of Biban-el-Melook (Melech?) is but a feeble specimen of the rest. Wewill add, furthermore, that the Arab-Christians, the monks, scattered around intheir poor, desolate convents on the borderland of the great Lybian Desert, knowof the existence of such unbetrayed relics. But they are Copts, sole remnants ofthe true Egyptian race, and the Copt predominating over the Christian monk intheir natures, they keep silent; for what reason it is not for us to tell. Thereare some who believe that their monkish attire is but a blind, and that theyhave chosen these desolate homes among arid deserts and surrounded by Mahometantribes, for some ulterior purposes of their own. Be it as it may, they are heldin great esteem by the Greek monks of Palestine; and there is a rumor currentamong the Christian pilgrims of Jerusalem, who throng the Holy Sepulchre atevery Easter, that the holy fire from heaven will never descend so miraculouslyas when these monks of the desert are present to draw it down by theirprayers. * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu107.htm#fn_808] \"The kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.\"Many are the candidates at the doors of those who are supposed to know the paththat leads to the secret brotherhoods. The great majority are refusedadmittance, and these turn away interpreting the refusal as an evidence of thenon-existence of any such secret society. Of the minority accepted, more thantwo-thirds fail upon trial. The seventh rule of the ancient Rosicrucianbrotherhoods, which is universal among all true secret societies: \"the Rosy-Cruxbecomes and is not made,\" is more than the generality of men can bear to haveapplied to them. But let no one suppose that of the candidates who fail, anywill divulge to the world even the trifle they may have learned, as some Masonsdo. None know better than themselves how unlikely it is that a neophyte shouldever talk of what was imparted to him. Thus these societies will go on and hearthemselves denied without uttering a word until the day shall come for them tothrow off their reserve and show how completely they are masters of thesituation.

Truly, unless we read the \"Old Testament\" kabalistically and comprehend thehidden meaning thereof, it is very little we can learn from it as regards thesoul's immortality. The common people among Hebrews had not the slightest ideaof soul and spirit, and made no difference between life, blood, and soul,calling the latter the \"breath of life.\" And King James's translators have madesuch a jumble of it that no one but a kabalist can restore the Bible to itsoriginal form. 363:* In \"Praecepta Decalogi \" (Edit. of Sion Library), Tom. i., lib. iv., c. 2,n. 7, 8. 363:** Opinion of John de Dicastille, Sect. xv., \"De Justitia et Jure,\" etc.,cens. pp. 319, 320. 363:*** \"Cursus Theologici,\" Tomus v., Duaci, 1642, Disp. 36, Sect. 5, n. 118. 364:*Name of the highest Egyptian hierophants. 364:** \"Crata Repoa, or the Mysteries of the Ancient Egyptian Priests.\" 364:*** See Matthew xvi. 18, where it is mistranslated \"the gates of Hell.\" 365:* Humberto Malhandrini: \"Ritual of Initiations,\" p. 105.

We do not say thiswith reference to the above-quoted author, earnest scholar and noble championthat he is, of freedom in the Christian Church, but generally. Baron Bunsen haswell found for himself that a man cannot remain an honest scientist and pleasethe clerical party. Even the little concessions he made in favor of theantiquity of mankind, brought on him, in 1859, the most insolent denunciations,such as \"We lose all faith in the author's judgment . . . he has yet to learnthe very first principles of historical criticisms . . . extravagant andunscientific exaggeration,\" and so on--the pious vituperator closing his learneddenunciations by assuring the public that Baron Bunsen \"cannot even construct aGreek sentence (\"Quarterly Review,\" 1859; see also \"Egypt's Place in UniversalHistory,\" chap. on Egyptological Works and English Reviews). But we do regretthat Baron Bunsen had no better opportunity to examine the \"Kabala\" and theBrahmanical books of the Zodiacs. 367:* \"The Funeral Ritual of the Deeds of Horus.\" 367:** Bunsen: \"Egypt's Place in Universal History,\" vol. v., p. 133. 367:*** Lepsius: \"Abth.,\" iii.; Bl., 276; Bunsen, 134. 368:* In the eighty-first chapter of the \"Ritual\" the soul is called the germ oflights and in the seventy-ninth the Demiurgos, or one of the creators. 368:** \"Ritual,\" vi, 44; Champollion: \"Manifestations to the Light\"; Lepsius:\"Book of the Dead\"; Bunsen: \"Egypt's Place in Universal History.\" 368:*** We cannot help quoting a remark by Baron Bunsen in relation to the\"Word\" being identical with the \"Ineffable Name\" of the Masons and thekabalists. While explaining the \"Ritual,\" some of the details of which \"resemblerather the enchantments of a magician than solemn rites, although a hidden andmystical meaning must have been attached to them\" (the honest admission of thismuch, at least, is worth something), the author observes: \"The mystery of names,the knowledge of which was a sovereign virtue, and which, at a later period,degenerated into the rank heresy (?) of the Gnostics and the magic ofenchanters, appears to have existed not only in Egypt but elsewhere. Traces ofit are found in the 'Cabala' . . . it prevailed in the Greek and Asiaticmythology\" (\"Egypt's Place, etc.,\" p. 147). We then see the representatives of Science agreeing upon this one point, atleast. The initiates of all countries had the same \"mystery name.\" And now itremains with the scholars to prove that every adept, hierophant, magician, orenchanter (Moses and Aaron included) as well as every kabalist, from theinstitution of the Mysteries down to the present age, has been either a knave ora fool, for believing in the efficacy of this name. 370:* See Chap. I., pp. 42, 43, note, of this volume. 372:* See \"The Principles of the Jesuits, Developed in a Collection of Extractsfrom their own Authors,\" London: J. G. and F.

In \"De Rege et Regis Institutione, Libri Tres,\" 1640 (Edit. Mus.

But the most delicate piece of Christian teaching is found in the precept ofthis Jesuit when he argues upon the best and surest way of killing kings andstatesmen. \"In my own opinion,\" he says, \"deleterious drugs should not be givento an enemy, neither should a deadly poison be mixed with his food or in his cup. . . Yet it will indeed be lawful to use this method in the case in question(that he who should kill the tyrant would be highly esteemed, both in favor andin praise,\" for \"it is a glorious thing to exterminate this pestilent andmischievous race from the community of men), not to constrain the person who isto be killed to take of himself the poison which, inwardly received, woulddeprive him of life, but to cause it to be outwardly applied by another withouthis intervention; as, when there is so much strength in the poison, that ifspread upon a seat or on the clothes it would be sufficiently powerful to causedeath\" (Ibid., lib. i., c. f., p. 67). \"It was thus that Squire attempted thelife of Queen Elizabeth, at the instigation of the Jesuit Walpole.\"--Pasquier:\"Catechisme des Jesuites\" (1677, p. 350, etc.), and \"Rapin\" (fol., Lond., 1733,vol. ii., book xvii., p. 148). 373:* Puffendorf: \"Droit de la Nat.,\" book iv., ch. 1. 373:** \"Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, thoushalt not forswear thyself. . . .

In the following pages we will endeavor to show how much these have beenmisinterpreted by the widely-different, yet intimately-related systemsenumerated above, in fitting them to their individual needs. Thus not only willa benefit be conferred upon the student, but a long-deferred, and nowmuch-needed act of justice will be done to those earlier generations whosegenius has laid the whole human race under obligation. Let us begin by once morecomparing the myths of the Bible with those of the sacred books of othernations, to see which is the original, which copies. There are but two methods which, correctly explained, can help us to thisresult. They are--the Vedas, Brahmanical literature and the Jewish Kabala. Theformer has, in a most philosophical spirit, conceived these grandiose myths; thelatter borrowing them from the Chaldeans and Persians, shaped them into ahistory of the Jewish nation, in which their spirit of philosophy was buriedbeyond the recognition of all but the elect, and under a far more absurd formthan the Aryan had given them. The Bible of the Christian Church is the latestreceptacle of this scheme of disfigured allegories which have been erected intoan edifice of superstition, such as never entered into the conceptions of thosefrom whom the Church obtained her knowledge. The abstract fictions of antiquity,which for ages had filled the popular fancy with but flickering shadows anduncertain images, have in Christianity assumed the shapes of real personages,and become accomplished facts. Allegory, metamorphosed, becomes sacred history,and Pagan myth is taught to the people as a revealed narrative of God'sintercourse with His chosen people. \"The myths,\" says Horace in his Ars Poetica, \"have been invented by wise men tostrengthen the laws and teach moral truths.\" While Horace endeavored to makeclear the very spirit and essence of the ancient myths, Euhemerus pretended, onthe contrary, that \"myths were the legendary history of kings and heroes,transformed into gods by the admiration of the nations.\" It is the latter methodwhich was inferentially followed by Christians when they agreed upon theacceptation of euhemerized patriarchs, and mistook them for men who had reallylived. But, in opposition to this pernicious theory, which has brought forth suchbitter fruit, we have a long series of the greatest philosophers the world hasproduced: Plato, Epicharmus, Socrates, Empedocles, Plotinus, and Porphyry,Proclus, Damascenus, Origen, and even Aristotle. The latter plainly stated thisverity, by saying that a tradition of the highest antiquity, transmitted toposterity under the form of various myths, teaches us that the first principlesof nature may be considered as \"gods,\" for the divine permeates all nature. Allthe rest, details and personages, were added later for the clearer comprehensionof the vulgar, and but too often with the object of supporting laws invented inthe common interest. Fairy tales do not exclusively belong to nurseries; all mankind--except thosefew who in all ages have comprehended their hidden meaning and tried to open theeyes of the superstitious--have listened to such tales in one shape or the otherand, after transforming them into sacred symbols, called the product RELIGION! We will try to systematize our subject as much as the ever-recurring necessityto draw parallels between the conflicting opinions that have been based on thesame myths will permit. We will begin by the book of Genesis, and seek for itshidden meaning in the Brahmanical traditions and the Chaldeo-Judaic Kabala. The first Scripture lesson taught us in our infancy is that God created theworld in six days, and rested on the seventh. Hence, a peculiar solemnity issupposed to attach to the seventh day, and the Christians, adopting the rigidobservances of the Jewish sabbath, have enforced it upon us with thesubstitution of the first, instead of the seventh day of the week. All systems of religious mysticism are based on numerals. With Pythagoras, theMonas or unity, emanating the duad, and thus forming the trinity, and thequaternary or Arba-il (the mystic four), compose the number seven. Thesacredness of numbers begins with the great First--the ONE, and ends only withthe nought or zero--symbol of the infinite and boundless circle which representsthe universe. All the intervening figures, in whatever combination, or howevermultiplied, represent philosophical ideas, from vague outlines down to adefinitely-established scientific axiom, relating either to a moral or aphysical fact in nature. They are a key to the ancient views on cosmogony, inits broad sense, including man and beings, and the evolution of the human race,spiritually as well as physically. The number seven is the most sacred of all, and is, undoubtedly, of Hinduorigin. Everything of importance was calculated by and fitted into this numberby the Aryan philosophers--ideas as well as localities. Thus they have the Sapta-Rishi, or seven sages, typifying the seven diluvian primitive races(post-diluvian as some say). Sapta-Loka, the seven inferior and superior worlds, whence each of these Rishisproceeded, and whither he returned in glory before reaching the final bliss ofMoksha. * Sapta-Kula, or seven castes--the Brahmans assuming to represent the directdescendants of the highest of them. ** Then, again, the Sapta-Pura (seven holy cities); Sapta-Duipa (seven holyislands); Sapta-Samudra (the seven holy seas); Sapta-Parvata (the seven holymountains); Sapta-Arania (the seven deserts); Sapta-Vruksha (the seven sacredtrees); and so on. In the Chaldeo-Babylonian incantation, this number reappears again asprominently as among the Hindus. The number is dual in its attributes, i.e.,holy in one of its aspects it becomes nefast under other conditions. Thus thefollowing incantation we find traced on the Assyrian tablets, now so correctlyinterpreted. \"The evening of evil omen, the region of the sky, which produces misfortune. . .. \"Message of pest.\"Deprecators of Nin-Ki-gal.\"The seven gods of the vast sky.\"The seven gods of the vast earth.\"The seven gods of blazing spheres.\"The seven gods of celestial legion.\"The seven gods maleficent.\"The seven phantoms--bad.\"The seven phantoms of maleficent flames. . . .\"Bad demon, bad alal, bad gigim, bad telal . . . bad god, bad maskim.\"Spirit of seven heavens remember . . . Spirit of seven earths remember . . .etc.\" This number reappears likewise on almost every page of Genesis, and throughoutthe Mosaic books, and we find it conspicuous (see following chapter) in the Bookof Job and the Oriental Kabala. If the Hebrew Semitics adopted it so readily, wemust infer that it was not blindly, but with a thorough knowledge of its secretmeaning; hence, that they must have adopted the doctrines of their \"heathen\"neighbors as well. It is but natural, therefore, that we should seek in heathenphilosophy for the interpretation of this number, which again reappeared inChristianity with its seven sacraments, seven churches in Asia Minor, sevencapital sins, seven virtues (four cardinal and three theological), etc. Have the seven prismatic colors of the rainbow seen by Noah no other meaningthan that of a covenant between God and man to refresh the memory of the former?To the kabalist, at least, they have a significance inseparable from the sevenlabors of magic, the seven upper spheres, the seven notes of the musical scale,the seven numerals of Pythagoras, the seven wonders of the world, the sevenages, and even the seven steps of the Masons, which lead to the Holy of Holies,after passing the flights of three and five. Whence the identity then of these enigmatical, ever-recurring numerals that arefound in every page of the Jewish Scriptures, as in every ola and sloka ofBuddhistic and Brahmanical books? Whence these numerals that are the soul of thePythagorean and Platonic thought, and that no unilluminated Orientalist norbiblical student has ever been able to fathom? And yet they have a key ready in their hand, did they but know how to use it.Nowhere is the mystical value of human language and its effects on human actionso perfectly understood as in India, nor any better explained than by theauthors of the oldest Brahmanas. Ancient as their epoch is now found to be, theyonly try to express, in a more concrete form, the abstract metaphysicalspeculations of their own ancestors. Such is the respect of the Brahmans for the sacrificial mysteries, that theyhold that the world itself sprang into creation as a consequence of a\"sacrificial word\" pronounced by the First Cause. This word is the \"Ineffablename\" of the kabalists, fully discussed in the last chapter. The secret of the Vedas, \"Sacred Knowledge\" though they may be, is impenetrablewithout the help of the Brahmanas. Properly speaking, the Vedas (which arewritten in verse and comprised in four books) constitute that portion called theMantra, or magical prayer, and the Brahmanas (which are in prose) contain theirkey. While the Mantra part is alone holy, the Brahmana portion contains all thetheological exegesis, and the speculations and explanations of the sacerdotal.Our Orientalists, we repeat, will make no substantial progress toward acomprehension of Vedic literature until they place a proper valuation upon worksnow despised by them; as, for instance, the Aitareya and Kaushitaki Brahmanas,which belong to the Rig-Veda. Zoroaster was called a Manthran, or speaker of Mantras, and, according to Haug,one of the earliest names for the Sacred Scriptures of the Parsis wasManthra-spenta. The power and significance of the Brahman who acts as theHotri-priest at the Soma-Sacrifice, consists in his possession and fullknowledge of the uses of the sacred word or speech--Vach. The latter ispersonified in Sara-isvati, the wife of Brahma, who is the goddess of the sacredor \"Secret Knowledge.\" She is usually depicted as riding upon a peacock with itstail all spread. The eyes upon the feathers of the bird's tail, symbolize thesleepless eyes that see all things. To one who has the ambition of becoming anadept of the \"Secret doctrines,\" they are a reminder that he must have thehundred eyes of Argus to see and comprehend all things. And this is why we say that it is not possible to solve fully the deep problemsunderlying the Brahmanical and Buddhistic sacred books without having a perfectcomprehension of the esoteric meaning of the Pythagorean numerals. The greatestpower of this Vach, or Sacred Speech, is developed according to the form whichis given to the Mantra by the officiating Hotri, and this form consists whollyin the numbers and syllables of the sacred metre. If pronounced slowly and in acertain rhythm, one effect is produced; if quickly and with another rhythm,there is a different result. \"Each metre,\" says Haug, \"is the invisible masterof something visible in this world; it is, as it were, its exponent and ideal.This great significance of the metrical speech is derived from the number ofsyllables of which it consists, for each thing has (just as in the Pythagoreansystem) a certain numerical proportion. All these things, metres (chhandas),stomas, and prishthas, are liable to be as eternal and divine as the wordsthemselves they contain. The earliest Hindu divines did not only believe in aprimitive revelation of the words of the sacred texts, but even in that of thevarious forms. These forms, along with their contents, the everlastingVeda-words, are symbols expressive of things of the invisible world, and inseveral respects comparable to the Platonic ideas.\" This testimony from an unwilling witness shows again the identity between theancient religions as to their secret doctrine. The Gayatri metre, for example,consists of thrice eight syllables, and is considered the most sacred of metres.It is the metre of Agni, the fire-god, and becomes at times the emblem of Brahmahimself, the chief creator, and \"fashioner of man\" in his own image. NowPythagoras says that \"The number eight, or the Octad, is the first cube, that isto say, squared in all senses, as a die, proceeding from its base two, or evennumber; so is man four-square or perfect.\" Of course few, except thePythagoreans and kabalists, can fully comprehend this idea; but the illustrationwill assist in pointing out the close kinship of the numerals with the VedicMantras. The chief problems of every theology lie concealed beneath this imageryof fire and the varying rhythm of its flames. The burning bush of the Bible, theZoroastrian and other sacred fires, Plato's universal soul, and the Rosicruciandoctrines of both soul and body of man being evolved out of fire, the reasoningand immortal element which permeates all things, and which, according toHerakleitus, Hippocrates, and Parmenides, is God, have all the same meaning. Each metre in the Brahmanas corresponds to a number, and as shown by Haug, as itstands in the sacred volumes, is a prototype of some visible form on earth, andits effects are either good or evil. The \"sacred speech\" can save, but it cankill as well; its many meanings and faculties are well known but to the Dikshita(the adept), who has been initiated into many mysteries, and whose \"spiritualbirth\" is completely achieved; the Vach of the mantra is a spoken power, whichawakes another corresponding and still more occult power, each allegoricallypersonified by some god in the world of spirits, and, according as it is used,responded to either by the gods or the Rakshasas (bad spirits). In theBrahmanical and Buddhist ideas, a curse, a blessing, a vow, a desire, an idlethought, can each assume a visible shape and so manifest itself objectively tothe eyes of its author, or to him that it concerns. Every sin becomes incarnated, so to say, and like an avenging fiend persecutesits perpetrator. There are words which have a destructive quality in their very syllables, asthough objective things; for every sound awakens a corresponding one in theinvisible world of spirit, and the repercussion produces either a good or badeffect. Harmonious rhythm, a melody vibrating softly in the atmosphere, createsa beneficent and sweet influence around, and acts most powerfully on thepsychological as well as physical natures of every living thing on earth; itreacts even on inanimate objects, for matter is still spirit in its essence,invisible as it may seem to our grosser senses. So with the numerals. Turn wherever we will, from the Prophets to theApocalypse, and we will see the biblical writers constantly using the numbersthree, four, seven, and twelve. And yet we have known some partisans of the Bible who maintained that the Vedaswere copied from the Mosaic books! *The Vedas, which are written in Sanscrit, alanguage whose grammatical rules and forms, as Max Muller and other scholarsconfess, were completely established long before the days when the great wave ofemigration bore it from Asia all over the Occident, are there to proclaim theirparentage of every philosophy, and every religious institution developed lateramong Semitic peoples. And which of the numerals most frequently occur in theSanscrit chants, those sublime hymns to creation, to the unity of God, and thecountless manifestations of His power? ONE, THREE, and SEVEN. Read the hymn byDirghatamas. \"TO HIM WHO REPRESENTS ALL THE GODS.\" \"The God here present, our blessed patron, our sacrificer, has a brother whospreads himself in mid-air. There exists a third Brother whom we sprinkle withour libations. . . . It is he whom I have seen master of men and armed withseven rays.\" ** And again: \"Seven Bridles aid in guiding a car which has but ONE wheel, and which is drawnby a single horse that shines with seven rays. The wheel has three limbs, animmortal wheel, never-wearying, whence hang all the worlds.\" \"Sometimes seven horses drag a car of seven wheels, and seven personages mountit, accompanied by seven fecund nymphs of the water.\" And the following again, in honor of the fire-god--Agni, who is so clearly shownbut a spirit subordinate to the ONE God. \"Ever ONE, although having three forms of double nature (androgynous)--he rises!and the priests offer to God, in the act of sacrifice, their prayers which reachthe heavens, borne aloft by Agni.\" Is this a coincidence, or, rather, as reason tells us, the result of thederivation of many national cults from one primitive, universal religion? Amystery for the uninitiated, the unveiling of the most sublime (because correctand true) psychological and physiological problems for the initiate. Revelationsof the personal spirit of man which is divine because that spirit is not onlythe emanation of the ONE Supreme God, but is the only God man is able, in hisweakness and helplessness, to comprehend--to feel within himself. This truth theVedic poet clearly confesses, when saying: \"The Lord, Master of the universe and full of wisdom, has entered with me (intome)--weak and ignorant--and has formed me of himself in that place *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_813] where the spirits obtain,by the help of Science, the peaceful enjoyment of the fruit, as sweet asambrosia.\" Whether we call this fruit \"an apple\" from the Tree of Knowledge, or the pippalaof the Hindu poet, it matters not. It is the fruit of esoteric wisdom. Ourobject is to show the existence of a religious system in India for manythousands of years before the exoteric fables of the Garden of Eden and theDeluge had been invented. Hence the identity of doctrines. Instructed in them,each of the initiates of other countries became, in his turn, the founder ofsome great school of philosophy in the West. Who of our Sanscrit scholars has ever felt interested in discovering the realsense of the following hymns, palpable as it is: \"Pippala, the sweet fruit ofthat tree upon which come spirits who love the science (?) and where the godsproduce all marvels. This is a mystery for him who knows not the Father of theworld.\" Or this one again: \"These stanzas bear at their head a title which announces that they areconsecrated to the Viswadevas (that is to say, to all the gods). He who knowsnot the Being whom I sing in all his manifestations, will comprehend nothing ofmy verses; those who do know HIM are not strangers to this reunion.\" This refers to the reunion and parting of the immortal and mortal parts of man.\"The immortal Being,\" says the preceding stanza, \"is in the cradle of the mortalBeing. The two eternal spirits go and come everywhere; only some men know theone without knowing the other\" (Dirghatamas). Who can give a correct idea of Him of whom the Rig-Veda says: \"That which is One the wise call it in divers manners.\" That One is sung by theVedic poets in all its manifestations in nature; and the books considered\"childish and foolish\" teach how at will to call the beings of wisdom for ourinstruction. They teach, as Porphyry says: \"a liberation from all terreneconcerns . . . a flight of the alone to the ALONE.\" Professor Max Muller, whose every word is accepted by his school as philologicalgospel, is undoubtedly right in one sense when in determining the nature of theHindu gods, he calls them \"masks without an actor . . . names without being, notbeings without names.\" * For he but proves thereby the monotheism of the ancientVedic religion. But it seems to us more than dubious whether he or any scientistof his school needed hope to fathom the old Aryan ** thought, without anaccurate study of those very \"masks.\" To the materialist, as to the scientist,who for various reasons endeavors to work out the difficult problem ofcompelling facts to agree with either their own hobbies or those of the Bible,they may seem but the empty shells of phantoms. Yet such authorities will everbe, as in the past, the unsafest of guides, except in matters of exact science.The Bible patriarchs are as much \"masks without actors,\" as the pragapatis, andyet, if the living personage behind these masks is but an abstract shadow thereis an idea embodied in every one of them which belongs to the philosophical andscientific theories of ancient wisdom. *** And who can render better service inthis work than the native Brahmans themselves, or the kabalists? To deny, point-blank, any sound philosophy in the later Brahmanical speculationsupon the Rig-Veda, is equivalent to refusing to ever correctly understand themother-religion itself, which gave rise to them, and which is the expression ofthe inner thought of the direct ancestors of these later authors of theBrahmanas. If learned Europeans can so readily show that all the Vedic gods arebut empty masks, they must also be ready to demonstrate that the Brahmanicalauthors were as incapable as themselves to discover these \"actors\" anywhere.This done, not only the three other sacred books which Max Muller says \"do notdeserve the name of Vedas,\" but the Rig-Veda itself becomes a meaningless jumbleof words; for what the world-renowned and subtile intellect of the ancient Hindusages failed to understand, no modern scientist, however learned, can hope tofathom. Poor Thomas Taylor was right in saying that \"philology is notphilosophy.\" It is, to say the least, illogical to admit that there is a hidden thought inthe literary work of a race perhaps ethnologically different from our own; andthen, because it is utterly unintelligible to us whose spiritual developmentduring the several thousand intervening years has bifurcated into quite acontrary direction--deny that it has any sense in it at all. But this isprecisely what, with all due respect for erudition, Professor Max Muller and hisschool do in this instance, at least. First of all, we are told that, albeitcautiously and with some effort, yet we may still walk in the footsteps of theseauthors of the Vedas. \"We shall feel that we are brought face to face and mindto mind with men yet intelligible to us after we have freed ourselves from ourmodern conceits. We shall not succeed always; words, verses, nay whole hymns inthe Rig-Veda, will and must remain to us a dead letter. . . . For, with a fewexceptions . . . the whole world of the Vedic ideas is so entirely beyond ourown intellectual horizon, that instead of translating, we can as yet only guessand combine.\" * And yet, to leave us in no possible doubt as to the true value of his words, thelearned scholar, in another passage, expresses his opinion on these same Vedas(with one exception) thus: \"The only important, the only real Veda, is theRig-Veda--the other so-called Vedas deserve the name of Veda no more than theTalmud deserves the name of Bible.\" Professor Muller rejects them as unworthy ofthe attention of any one, and, as we understand it, on the ground that theycontain chiefly \"sacrificial formulas, charms, and incantations.\" ** And now, a very natural question: Are any of our scholars prepared todemonstrate that, so far, they are intimately acquainted with the hidden senseof these perfectly absurd \"sacrificial formulas, charms, and incantations\" andmagic nonsense of Atharva-Veda? We believe not, and our doubt is based on theconfession of Professor Muller himself, just quoted. If \"the whole world of theVedic ideas [the Rig-Veda cannot be included alone in this world, we suppose] isso entirely beyond our own [the scientists'] intellectual horizon that, insteadof translating, we can as yet only guess and combine\"; and the Yagur-Veda,Sama-Veda, and Atharva-Veda are \"childish and foolish\"; *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_819] and the Brahmanas, theSutras Yaska, and Sayana, \"though nearest in time to the hymns of the Rig-Veda,indulge in the most frivolous and ill-judged interpretations,\" how can eitherhimself or any other scholar form any adequate opinion of either of them? If,again, the authors of the Brahmanas, the nearest in time to the Vedic hymns,were already incompetent to offer anything better than \"ill-judgedinterpretations,\" then at what period of history, where, and by whom, werewritten these grandiose poems, whose mystical sense has died with theirgenerations? Are we, then, so wrong in affirming that if sacred texts are foundin Egypt to have become--even to the priestly scribes of 4,000 years ago--whollyunintelligible, ** [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_820] and theBrahmanas offer but \"childish and foolish\" interpretations of the Rig-Veda, atleast as far back as that, then, 1st, both the Egyptian and Hindu religiousphilosophies are of an untold antiquity, far antedating ages cautiously assignedthem by our students of comparative mythology; and, 2d, the claims of ancientpriests of Egypt and modern Brahmans, as to their age, are, after all, correct. We can never admit that the three other Vedas are less worthy of their name thanthe Rig-hymns, or that the Talmud and the Kabala are so inferior to the Bible.The very name of the Vedas (the literal meaning of which is knowledge or wisdom)shows them to belong to the literature of those men who, in every country,language, and age, have been spoken of as \"those who know.\" In Sanscrit thethird person singular is veda (he knows), and the plural is vida (they know).This word is synonymous with the Greek Τηεοσεβεια, which Plato uses whenspeaking of the wise--the magicians; and with the Hebrew Hakamin,[images/00084.jpg](wise men). Reject the Talmud and its old predecessor theKabala, and it will be simply impossible ever to render correctly one word ofthat Bible so much extolled at their expense. But then it is, perhaps, just whatits partisans are working for. To banish the Brahmanas is to fling away the keythat unlocks the door of the Rig-Veda. The literal interpretation of the Biblehas already borne its fruits; with the Vedas and the Sanscrit sacred books ingeneral it will be just the same, with this difference, that the absurdinterpretation of the Bible has received a time-honored right of eminent domainin the department of the ridiculous; and will find its supporters, against lightand against proof. As to the \"heathen\" literature, after a few more years ofunsuccessful attempts at interpretation, its religious meaning will be relegatedto the limbo of exploded superstitions, and people will hear no more of it. We beg to be clearly understood before we are blamed and criticised for theabove remarks. The vast learning of the celebrated Oxford professor can hardlybe questioned by his very enemies, yet we have a right to regret hisprecipitancy to condemn that which he himself confesses \"entirely beyond our ownintellectual horizon.\" Even in what he considers a ridiculous blunder on thepart of the author of the Brahmanas, other more spiritually-disposed persons maysee quite the reverse. \"Who is the greatest of the gods? Who shall first bepraised by our songs?\" says an ancient Rishi of the Rig-Veda; mistaking (asProf. M. imagines) the interrogative pronoun \"Who\" for some divine name. Saysthe Professor: \"A place is allotted in the sacrificial invocations to a god'Who,' and hymns addressed to him are called 'Whoish hymns.' \" And is a god\"Who\" less natural as a term than a god \"I am\"? or \"Whoish\" hymns lessreverential than \"I-amish\" psalms? And who can prove that this is really ablunder, and not a premeditated expression? Is it so impossible to believe thatthe strange term was precisely due to a reverential awe which made the poethesitate before giving a name, as form to that which is justly considered as thehighest abstraction of metaphysical ideals--God? Or that the same feeling madethe commentator who came after him to pause and so leave the work ofanthropomorphizing the \"Unknown,\" the \"WHO,\" to future human conception? \"Theseearly poets thought more for themselves--than for others,\" remarks Max Mullerhimself. \"They sought rather, in their language, to be true to their own thoughtthan to please the imagination of their hearers.\" * Unfortunately it is thisvery thought which awakes no responsive echo in the minds of our philologists. Farther, we read the sound advice to students of the Rig-Veda hymns, to collect,collate, sift, and reject. \"Let him study the commentaries, the Sutras, theBrahmanas, and even later works, in order to exhaust all the sources from whichinformation can be derived. He [the scholar] must not despise the traditions ofthe Brahmans, even where their misconceptions . . . are palpable. . . . Not acorner in the Brahmanas, the Sutras, Yaska, and Sayana, should be leftunexplored before we propose a rendering of our own. . . . When the scholar hasdone his work, the poet and philosopher must take it up and finish it.\" ** Poor chance for a \"philosopher\" to step into the shoes of a learned philologistand presume to correct his errors! We would like to see what sort of a receptionthe most learned Hindu scholar in India would have from the educated public ofEurope and America, if he should undertake to correct a savant, after he hadsifted, accepted, rejected, explained, and declared what was good, and what\"absurd and childish\" in the sacred books of his forefathers. That which wouldfinally be declared \"Brahmanic misconceptions,\" by the conclave of European andespecially German savants, would be as little likely to be reconsidered at theappeal of the most erudite pundit of Benares or Ceylon, as the interpretation ofJewish Scripture by Maimonides and Philo-Judaeus, by Christians after theCouncils of the Church had accepted the mistranslations and explanations ofIrenaeus and Eusebius. What pundit, or native philosopher of India should knowhis ancestral language, religion, or philosophy as well as an Englishman or aGerman? Or why should a Hindu be more suffered to expound Brahmanism, than aRabbinical scholar to interpret Judaism or the Isaian prophecies? Safer, and farmore trustworthy translators can be had nearer home. Nevertheless, let us stillhope that we may find at last, even though it be in the dim future, a Europeanphilosopher to sift the sacred books of the wisdom-religion, and not becontradicted by every other of his class. Meanwhile, unmindful of any alleged authorities, let us try to sift forourselves a few of these myths of old. We will search for an explanation withinthe popular interpretation, and feel our way with the help of the magic lamp ofTrismegistus--the mysterious number seven. There must have been some reason whythis figure was universally accepted as a mystic calculation. With every ancientpeople, the Creator, or Demiurge, was placed over the seventh heaven. \"And wereI to touch upon the initiation into our sacred Mysteries,\" says Emperor Julian,the kabalist, \"which the Chaldean bacchised respecting the seven-rayed God,lifting up the souls through Him, I should say things unknown, and very unknownto the rabble, but well known to the blessed Theurgists.\" * In Lydus it is saidthat \"The Chaldeans call the God IAO, and SABAOTH he is often called, as He whois over the seven orbits (heavens, or spheres), that is the Demiurge.\" ** One must consult the Pythagoreans and Kabalists to learn the potentiality ofthis number. Exoterically the seven rays of the solar spectrum are representedconcretely in the seven-rayed god Heptaktis. These seven rays epitomized intoTHREE primary rays, namely, the red, blue, and yellow, form the solar trinity,and typify respectively spirit-matter and spirit-essence. Science has alsoreduced of late the seven rays to three primary ones, thus corroborating thescientific conception of the ancients of at least one of the visiblemanifestations of the invisible deity, and the seven divided into a quaternaryand a trinity. The Pythagoreans called the number seven the vehicle of life, as it containedbody and soul. They explained it by saying, that the human body consisted offour principal elements, and that the soul is triple, comprising reason,passion, and desire. The ineffable WORD was considered the Seventh and highestof all, for there are six minor substitutes, each belonging to a degree ofinitiation. The Jews borrowed their Sabbath from the ancients, who called itSaturn's day and deemed it unlucky, and not the latter from the Israelites whenChristianized. The people of India, Arabia, Syria, and Egypt observed weeks ofseven days; and the Romans learned the hebdomadal method from these foreigncountries when they became subject to the Empire. Still it was not until thefourth century that the Roman kalends, nones, and ides were abandoned, and weekssubstituted in their place; and the astronomical names of the days, such as diesSolis (day of the Sun), dies Lunae (day of the Moon), dies Martis (day of Mars);dies Mercurii (day of Mercury), dies Jovis (day of Jupiter), dies Veneris (dayof Venus), and dies Saturni (day of Saturn), prove that it was not from the Jewsthat the week of seven days was adopted. Before we examine this numberkabalistically, we propose to analyse it from the standpoint of theJudaico-Christian Sabbath. When Moses instituted the yom shaba, or Shebang (Shabbath), the allegory of theLord God resting from his work of creation on the seventh day was but a cloak,or, as the Sohar expresses it, a screen, to hide the true meaning. The Jews reckoned then, as they do now, their days by number, as, day the first;day the second; and so on; yom ahad; yom sheni; yom shelisho; yom rebis; yomshamishi; yom shishehi; Yom SHABA. \"The Hebrew seven [images/00085.jpg], consisting of three letters, S. B. O., hasmore than one meaning. First of all, it means age or cycle, Shab-ang; Sabbath[images/00086.jpg]can be translated old age, as well as rest, and in the oldCoptic, Sabe means wisdom, learning. Modern archaeologists have found that as inHebrew Sab [images/00087.jpg]also means gray-headed, and that therefore theSaba-day was the day on which the \"gray-headed men, or 'aged fathers' of atribe, were in the habit of assembling for councils or sacrifices.\" * \"Thus, the week of six days and the seventh, the Saba or Sapta-day period, is ofthe highest antiquity. The observance of the lunar festivals in India, showsthat that nation held hebdomadal meetings as well. With every new quarter themoon brings changes in the atmosphere, hence certain changes are also producedthroughout the whole of our universe, of which the meteorological ones are themost insignificant. On this day of the seventh and most powerful of theprismatic days, the adepts of the \"Secret Science\" meet as they met thousands ofyears ago, to become the agents of the occult powers of nature (emanations ofthe working God), and commune with the invisible worlds. It is in thisobservance of the seventh day by the old sages--not as the resting day of theDeity, but because they had penetrated into its occult power, that lies theprofound veneration of all the heathen philosophers for the number seven whichthey term the \"venerable,\" the sacred number. The Pythagorean Tetraktis, reveredby the Platonists, was the square placed below the triangle; the latter, or theTrinity embodying the invisible Monad--the unity, and deemed too sacred to bepronounced except within the walls of a Sanctuary. The ascetic observance of the Christian Sabbath by Protestants is pure religioustyranny, and does more harm, we fear, than good. It really dates only from theenactment (in 1678) of the 29th of Charles II., which prohibited any \"tradesman,artificer, workman, laborer, or other person,\" to \"do or exercise any worldlylabor, etc., etc., upon the Lord's day.\" The Puritans carried this thing toextremes, apparently to mark their hatred of Catholicism, both Roman andEpiscopal. That it was no part of the plan of Jesus that such a day should beset apart, is evident not only from his words but acts. It was not observed bythe early Christians. When Trypho, the Jew, reproached the Christians for not having a Sabbath, whatdoes the martyr answer him? \"The new law will have you keep a perpetual Sabbath.You, when you have passed a day in idleness, think you are religious. The Lordis not pleased with such things as these. If any be guilty of perjury or fraud,let him reform; if he be an adulterer, let him repent; and he will then havekept the kind of Sabbath truly pleasing to God. . . . The elements are neveridle, and keep no Sabbath. There was no need of the observance of Sabbathsbefore Moses, neither now is there any need of them after Jesus Christ.\" The Heptaktis is not the Supreme Cause, but simply an emanation from Him--thefirst visible manifestation of the Unrevealed Power. \"His Divine Breath, which,violently breaking forth, condensed itself, shining with radiance until itevolved into Light, and so became cognizant to external sense,\" says JohnReuchlin. * This is the emanation of the Highest, the Demiurge, a multiplicityin a unity, the Elohim, whom we see creating our world, or rather fashioning it,in six days, and resting on the seventh. And who are these Elohim but theeuhemerized powers of nature, the faithful manifested servants, the laws of Himwho is immutable law and harmony Himself? They remain over the seventh heaven (or spiritual world), for it is they who,according to the kabalists, formed in succession the six material worlds, orrather, attempts at worlds, that preceded our own, which, they say, is theseventh. If, in laying aside the metaphysico-spiritual conception, we give ourattention but to the religio-scientific problem of creation in \"six days,\" overwhich our best biblical scholars have vainly pondered so long, we might,perchance, be on the way to the true idea underlying the allegory. The ancientswere philosophers, consistent in all things. Hence, they taught that each ofthese departed worlds, having performed its physical evolution, andreached--through birth, growth, maturity, old age, and death--the end of itscycle, had returned to its primitive subjective form of a spiritual earth.Thereafter it had to serve through all eternity as the dwelling of those who hadlived on it as men, and even animals, but were now spirits. This idea, were iteven as incapable of exact demonstration as that of our theologians relating toParadise, is, at least, a trifle more philosophical. As well as man, and every other living thing upon it, our planet has had itsspiritual and physical evolution. From an impalpable ideal thought under thecreative Will of Him of whom we know nothing, and but dimly conceive inimagination, this globe became fluidic and semi-spiritual, then condensed itselfmore and more, until its physical development--matter, the temptingdemon--compelled it to try its own creative faculty. Matter defied SPIRIT, andthe earth, too, had its \"Fall.\" The allegorical curse under which it labors, isthat it only procreates, it does not create. Our physical planet is but thehandmaiden, or rather the maid-of-all-work, of the spirit, its master. \"Cursedbe the ground . . . thorns and thistles shall it bring,\" the Elohim are made tosay. \"In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children.\" The Elohim say this both tothe ground and the woman. And this curse will last until the minutest particleof matter on earth shall have outlived its days, until every grain of dust has,by gradual transformation through evolution, become a constituent part of a\"living soul,\" and, until the latter shall reascend the cyclic arc, and finallystand--its own Metatron, or Redeeming Spirit--at the foot of the upper step ofthe spiritual worlds, as at the first hour of its emanation. Beyond that liesthe great \"Deep\"--A MYSTERY! It must be remembered that every cosmogony has a trinity of workers at itshead--Father, spirit; Mother, nature, or matter; and the manifested universe,the Son or result of the two. The universe, also, as well as each planet whichit comprehends, passes through four ages, like man himself. All have theirinfancy, youth, maturity, and old age, and these four added to the other threemake the sacred seven again. The introductory chapters of Genesis were never meant to present even a remoteallegory of the creation of our earth. They embrace (chapter i.) a metaphysicalconception of some indefinite period in the eternity, when successive attemptswere being made by the law of evolution at the formation of universes. This ideais plainly stated in the Sohar: \"There were old worlds, which perished as soonas they came into existence, were formless, and were called sparks. Thus, thesmith, when hammering the iron, lets the sparks fly in all directions. Thesparks are the primordial worlds which could not continue, because the SacredAged (Sephira) had not as yet assumed its form (of androgyne or opposite sexes)of king and queen (Sephira and Kadmon) and the Master was not yet at hiswork.\" * The six periods or \"days\" of Genesis refer to the same metaphysical belief. Fivesuch ineffectual attempts were made by the Elohim, but the sixth resulted inworlds like our own (i.e., all the planets and most of the stars are worlds, andinhabited, though not like our earth). Having formed this world at last in thesixth period, the Elohim rested in the seventh. Thus the \"Holy One,\" when hecreated the present world, said: \"This pleases me; the previous ones did notplease me.\" **And the Elohim \"saw everything that he had made, and behold it wasvery good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\"--Genesis i. The reader will remember that in Chapter IV. an explanation was given of the\"day\" and \"night\" of Brahma. The former represents a certain period of cosmicalactivity, the latter an equal one of cosmical repose. In the one, worlds arebeing evolved, and passing through their allotted four ages of existence; in thelatter the \"inbreathing\" of Brahma reverses the tendency of the natural forces;everything visible becomes gradually dispersed; chaos comes; and a long night ofrepose reinvigorates the cosmos for its next term of evolution. In the morningof one of these \"days\" the formative processes are gradually reaching theirclimax of activity; in the evening imperceptibly diminishing the same until thepralaya arrives, and with it \"night.\" One such morning and evening do, in fact,constitute a cosmic day; and it was a \"day of Brahma\" that the kabalistic authorof Genesis had in mind each time when he said: \"And the evening and the morningwere the first (or fifth or sixth, or any other) day.\" Six days of gradualevolution, one of repose, and then--evening! Since the first appearance of manon our earth there has been an eternal Sabbath or rest for the Demiurge. The cosmogonical speculations of the first six chapters of Genesis are shown inthe races of \"sons of God,\" \"giants,\" etc., of chapter vi. Properly speaking,the story of the formation of our earth, or \"creation,\" as it is very improperlycalled, begins with the rescue of Noah from the deluge. The Chaldeo-Babyloniantablets recently translated by George Smith leave no doubt of that in the mindsof those who read the inscriptions esoterically. Ishtar, the great goddess,speaks in column iii. of the destruction of the sixth world and the appearanceof the seventh, thus: \"Six days and nights the wind, deluge, and storm overwhelmed.\"On the seventh day, in its course was calmed the storm, and all the deluge,\"which had destroyed like an earthquake, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_829] \"quieted. The sea hecaused to dry, and the wind and deluge ended. . . .\"I perceived the shore at the boundary of the sea. . . .\"to the country of Nizir went the ship (argha, or the moon).\"the mountain of Nizir stopped the ship. . . .\"the first day, and the second day, the mountain of Nizir the same.\"the fifth and the sixth, the mountain of Nizir the same.\"on the seventh day, in the course of it\"I sent forth a dove, and it left. The dove went and turned, and . . . the ravenwent . . . and did not return.\"I built an altar on the peak of the mountain.\"by seven herbs I cut, at the bottom of them I placed reeds, pines, and simgar.. . .\"the gods like flies over the sacrifice gathered.\"from of old also the great God in his course. \"the great brightness (the sun) of Anu had created. * When the glory of thosegods the charm round my neck would not repel,\" etc. All this has a purely astronomical, magical, and esoteric relation. One whoreads these tablets will recognize at a glance the biblical account; and judge,at the same time, how disfigured is the great Babylonian poem by euhemericpersonages--degraded from their exalted positions of gods into simplepatriarchs. Space prevents our entering fully into this biblical travesty of theChaldean allegories. We shall therefore but remind the reader that by theconfession of the most unwilling witnesses--such as Lenormant, first theinventor and then champion of the Akkadians--the Chaldeo-Babylonian triad placedunder Ilon, the unrevealed deity, is composed of Anu, Nuah, and Bel. Anu is theprimordial chaos, the god time and world at once, χρομος and Κοσμος, theuncreated matter issued from the one and fundamental principle of all things. Asto Nuah, he is, according to the same Orientalist: \". . . the intelligence, we will willingly say the verbum, which animates andfecundates matter, which penetrates the universe, directs and makes it live; andat the same time Nuah is the king of the humid principle; the Spirit moving onthe waters.\" Is not this evident? Nuah is Noah, floating on the waters, in his ark; thelatter being the emblem of the argha, or moon, the feminine principle; Noah isthe \"spirit\" falling into matter. We find him as soon as he descends upon theearth, planting a vineyard, drinking of the wine, and getting drunk on it; i.e.,the pure spirit becoming intoxicated as soon as it is finally imprisoned inmatter. The seventh chapter of Genesis is but another version of the first.Thus, while the latter reads: \" . . . and darkness was upon the face of thedeep. And the spirit (of God) moved upon the face of the waters,\" in chapterseventh, it is said: \" . . . and the waters prevailed . . . and the ark went(with Noah--the spirit) upon the face of the waters.\" Thus Noah, if the ChaldeanNuah, is the spirit vivifying matter, chaos represented by the deep or waters ofthe flood. In the Babylonian legend it is Istar (Astoreth, the moon) which isshut up in the ark, and sends out a dove (emblem of Venus and other lunargoddesses) in search of dry land. And whereas in the Semitic tablets it isXisuthrus or Hasisadra who is \"translated to the company of the gods for hispiety,\" in the Bible it is Enoch who walks with, and being taken up by God, \"wasno more.\" The successive existence of an incalculable number of worlds before thesubsequent evolution of our own, was believed and taught by all the ancientpeoples. The punishment of the Christians for despoiling the Jews of theirrecords and refusing the true key to them began from the earliest centuries. Andthus is it that we find the holy Fathers of the Church laboring through animpossible chronology and the absurdities of literal interpretation, while thelearned rabbis were perfectly aware of the real significance of theirallegories. So not only in the Sohar, but also in other kabalistic worksaccepted by Talmudists, such as Midrash Berasheth, or the universal Genesis,which, with the Merkaba (the chariot of Ezekiel), composes the Kabala, may befound the doctrine of a whole series of worlds evolving out of the chaos, andbeing destroyed in succession. The Hindu doctrines teach of two Pralayas or dissolutions; one universal, theMaha-Pralaya, the other partial, or the minor Pralaya. This does not relate tothe universal dissolution which occurs at the end of every \"Day of Brahma,\" butto the geological cataclysms at the end of every minor cycle of our globe. Thishistorical and purely local deluge of Central Asia, the traditions of which canbe traced in every country, and which, according to Bunsen, happened about theyear 10,000 B.C., had naught to do with the mythical Noah, or Nuah. A partialcataclysm occurs at the close of every \"age\" of the world, they say, which doesnot destroy the latter, but only changes its general appearance. New races ofmen and animals and a new flora evolve from the dissolution of the precedentones. The allegories of the \"fall of man\" and the \"deluge,\" are the two most importantfeatures of the Pentateuch. They are, so to say, the Alpha and Omega, thehighest and the lowest keys of the scale of harmony on which resounds themajestic hymns of the creation of mankind; for they discover to him whoquestions the Zura (figurative Gematria), the process of man's evolution fromthe highest spiritual entity unto the lowest physical--the post-diluvian man, asin the Egyptian hieroglyphics, every sign of the picture writing which cannot bemade to fit within a certain circumscribed geometrical figure may be rejected asonly intended by the sacred hierogrammatist for a premeditated blind--so many ofthe details in the Bible must be treated on the same principle, that portiononly being accepted which answers to the numerical methods taught in the Kabala. The deluge appears in the Hindu books only as a tradition. It claims no sacredcharacter, and we find it but in the Mahabharata, the Puranas, and still earlierin the Satapatha, one of the latest Brahmanas. It is more than probable thatMoses, or whoever wrote for him, used these accounts as the basis of his ownpurposely disfigured allegory, adding to it moreover the Chaldean Berosiannarrative. In Mahabharata, we recognize Nimrod under the name of King Daytha.The origin of the Grecian fable of the Titans scaling Olympus, and the other ofthe builders of the Tower of Babel who seek to reach heaven, is shown in theimpious Daytha, who sends imprecations against heaven's thunder, and threatensto conquer heaven itself with his mighty warriors, thereby bringing uponhumanity the wrath of Brahma. \"The Lord then resolved,\" says the text, \"tochastise his creatures with a terrible punishment which should serve as awarning to survivors, and to their descendants.\" Vaivasvata (who in the Bible becomes Noah) saves a little fish, which turns outto be an avatar of Vishnu. The fish warns that just man that the globe is aboutto be submerged, that all that inhabit it must perish, and orders him toconstruct a vessel in which he shall embark, with all his family. When the shipis ready, and Vaivasvata has shut up in it with his family the seeds of plantsand pairs of all animals, and the rain begins to fall, a gigantic fish, armedwith a horn, places itself at the head of the ark. The holy man, following itsorders, attaches a cable to this horn, and the fish guides the ship safelythrough the raging elements. In the Hindu tradition the number of days duringwhich the deluge lasted agrees exactly with that of the Mosaic account. When theelements were calmed, the fish landed the ark on the summit of the Himalayas. This fable is considered by many orthodox commentators to have been borrowedfrom the Mosaic Scriptures. * But surely if such a universal cataclysm had evertaken place within man's memory, some of the monuments of the Egyptians, ofwhich many are of such a tremendous antiquity, would have recorded thatoccurrence, coupled with that of the disgrace of Ham, Canaan, and Mizraim, theiralleged ancestors. But, till now, there has not been found the remotest allusionto such a calamity, although Mizraim certainly belongs to the first generationafter the deluge, if not actually an antediluvian himself. On the other hand theChaldeans preserved the tradition, as we find Berosus testifying to it, and theancient Hindus possess the legend as given above. Now, there is but oneexplanation of the extraordinary fact that of two contemporary and civilizednations like Egypt and Chaldea, one has preserved no tradition of it whatever,although it was the most directly interested in the occurrence--if we credit theBible--and the other has. The deluge noticed in the Bible, in one of theBrahmanas, and in the Berosus Fragment, relates to the partial flood which,about 10,000 years B.C., according to Bunsen, and according to the Brahmanicalcomputations of the Zodiac also changed the whole face of Central Asia. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_832] Thus the Babylonians andthe Chaldeans might have learned of it from their mysterious guests, christenedby some Assyriologists Akkadians, or what is still more probable they,themselves, perhaps, were the descendants of those who had dwelt in thesubmerged localities. The Jews had the tale from the latter as they hadeverything else; the Brahmans may have recorded the traditions of the landswhich they first invaded, and had perhaps inhabited before they possessedthemselves of the Punjab. But the Egyptians, whose first settlers had evidentlycome from Southern India, had less reason to record the cataclysm, since it hadperhaps never affected them except indirectly, as the flood was limited toCentral Asia. Burnouf, noticing the fact that the story of the deluge is found only in one ofthe most modern Brahmanas, also thinks that it might have been borrowed by theHindus from the Semitic nations. Against such an assumption are ranged all thetraditions and customs of the Hindus. The Aryans, and especially the Brahmans,never borrowed anything at all from the Semitists, and here we are corroboratedby one of those \"unwilling witnesses,\" as Higgins calls the partisans of Jehovahand Bible. \"I have never seen anything in the history of the Egyptians andJews,\" writes Abbe Dubois, forty years a resident of India, \"that would induceme to believe that either of these nations, or any other on the face of theearth, have been established earlier than the Hindus, and particularly theBrahmans; so I cannot be induced to believe that the latter have drawn theirrites from foreign nations. On the contrary, I infer that they have drawn themfrom an original source of their own. Whoever knows anything of the spirit andcharacter of the Brahmans, their stateliness, their pride, and extreme vanity,their distance, and sovereign contempt for everything that is foreign, and ofwhich they cannot boast to have been the inventors, will agree with me that sucha people cannot have consented to draw their customs and rules of conduct froman alien country.\" * This fable which mentions the earliest avatar--the Matsya--relates to anotheryuga than our own, that of the first appearance of animal life; perchance, whoknows, to the Devonian age of our geologists? It certainly answers better to thelatter than the year 2348 B.C.! Apart from this, the very absence of all mentionof the deluge from the oldest books of the Hindus suggests a powerful argumentwhen we are left utterly to inferences as in this case. \"The Vedas and Manu,\"says Jacolliot, \"those monuments of the old Asiatic thought, existed far earlierthan the diluvian period; this is an incontrovertible fact, having all the valueof an historical truth, for, besides the tradition which shows Vishnu himself assaving the Vedas from the deluge--a tradition which, notwithstanding itslegendary form, must certainly rest upon a real fact--it has been remarked thatneither of these sacred books mention the cataclysm, while the Puranas and theMahabharata, and a great number of other more recent works, describe it with theminutest detail, which is a proof of the priority of the former. The Vedascertainly would never have failed to contain a few hymns on the terribledisaster which, of all other natural manifestations, must have struck theimagination of the people who witnessed it.\" \"Neither would Manu, who gives us a complete narrative of the creation, with achronology from the divine and heroical ages, down to the appearance of man onearth--have passed in silence an event of such importance.\" Manu (book i., sloka35), gives the names of ten eminent saints whom he calls pradjapatis (morecorrectly pragapatis), in whom the Brahman theologians see prophets, ancestorsof the human race, and the Pundits simply consider as ten powerful kings wholived in the Krita-yug, or the age of good (the golden age of the Greeks). The last of these pragapatis is Brighou. \"Enumerating the succession of these eminent beings who, according to Manu, havegoverned the world, the old Brahmanical legislator names as descending fromBrighou: Swarotchica, Ottami, Tamasa, Raivata, the glorious Tchakchoucha, andthe son of Vivasvat, every one of the six having made himself worthy of thetitle of Manu (divine legislator), a title which had equally belonged to thePradjapatis, and every great personage of primitive India. The genealogy stopsat this name. \"Now, according to the Puranas and the Mahabharata it was under a descendant ofthis son of Vivaswata, named Vaivaswata that occurred the great cataclysm, theremembrance of which, as will be seen, has passed into a tradition, and beencarried by emigration into all the countries of the East and West which Indiahas colonized since then. . . . \"The genealogy given by Manu stopping, as we have seen, at Vivaswata, it followsthat this work (of Manu) knew nothing either of Vaivaswata or the deluge.\" * The argument is unanswerable; and we commend it to those official scientists,who, to please the clergy, dispute every fact proving the tremendous antiquityof the Vedas and Manu. Colonel Vans Kennedy has long since declared thatBabylonia was, from her origin, the seat of Sanscrit literature and Brahmanlearning. And how or why should the Brahmans have penetrated there, unless itwas as the result of intestine wars and emigration from India? The fullestaccount of the deluge is found in the Mahabharata of Vedavyasa, a poem in honorof the astrological allegories on the wars between the Solar and the Lunarraces. One of the versions states that Vivaswata became the father of all thenations of the earth through his own progeny, and this is the form adopted forthe Noachian story; the other states that--like Deukalion and Pyrrha--he had butto throw pebbles into the ilus left by the retiring waves of the flood, toproduce men at will. These two versions--one Hebrew, the other Greek--allow usno choice. We must either believe that the Hindus borrowed from pagan Greeks aswell as from monotheistic Jews, or--what is far more probable--that the versionsof both of these nations are derived from the Vedic literature through theBabylonians. History tells us of the stream of immigration across the Indus, and later of itsoverflowing the Occident; and of populations of Hindu origin passing from AsiaMinor to colonize Greece. But history says not a single word of the \"chosenpeople,\" or of Greek colonies having penetrated India earlier than the 5th and4th centuries B.C., when we first find vague traditions that make some of theproblematical lost tribes of Israel, take from Babylon the route to India. Buteven were the story of the ten tribes to find credence, and the tribesthemselves be proved to have existed in profane as well as in sacred history,this does not help the solution at all. Colebrooke, Wilson, and other eminentIndianists show the Mahabharata, if not the Satapatha-brahmana, in which thestory is also given, as by far antedating the age of Cyrus, hence, the possibletime of the appearance of any of the tribes of Israel in India. ** Orientalists accord the Mahabharata an antiquity of between twelve and fifteenhundred years B.C.; as to the Greek version it bears as little evidence as theother, and the attempts of the Hellenists in this direction have as signallyfailed. The story of the conquering army of Alexander penetrating into NorthernIndia, itself becomes more doubted every day. No Hindu national record, not theslightest historical memento, throughout the length and breadth of India offersthe slightest trace of such an invasion. If even such historical facts are now found to have been all the while fictions,what are we to think of narratives which bear on their very face the stamp ofinvention? We cannot help sympathizing at heart with Professor Muller when heremarks that it seems \"blasphemy to consider these fables of the heathen worldas corrupted and misinterpreted fragments of divine Revelation once granted tothe whole race of mankind.\" Only, can this scholar be held perfectly impartialand fair to both parties, unless he includes in the number of these fables thoseof the Bible? And is the language of the Old Testament more pure or moral thanthe books of the Brahmans? Or any fables of the heathen world more blasphemousand ridiculous than Jehovah's interview with Moses (Exodus xxxiii. 23)? Are anyof the Pagan gods made to appear more fiendish than the same Jehovah in a scoreof passages? If the feelings of a pious Christian are shocked at the absurditiesof Father Kronos eating his children and maiming Uranos; or of Jupiter throwingVulcan down from heaven and breaking his leg; on the other hand he cannot feelhurt if a non-Christian laughs at the idea of Jacob boxing with the Creator, who\"when he saw that he prevailed not against him,\" dislocated Jacob's thigh, thepatriarch still holding fast to God and not allowing Him to go His way,notwithstanding His pleading. Why should the story of Deukalion and Pyrrha, throwing stones behind them, andthus creating the human race, be deemed more ridiculous than that of Lot's wifebeing changed into a pillar of salt, or of the Almighty creating men of clay andthen breathing the breath of life into them? The choice between the latter modeof creation and that of the Egyptian ram-horned god fabricating man on apotter's wheel is hardly perceptible. The story of Minerva, goddess of wisdom,ushered into existence after a certain period of gestation in her father'sbrain, is at least suggestive and poetical, as an allegory. No ancient Greek wasever burned for not accepting it literally; and, at all events, \"heathen\" fablesin general are far less preposterous and blasphemous than those imposed uponChristians, ever since the Church accepted the Old Testament, and the RomanCatholic Church opened its register of thaumaturgical saints. \"Many of the natives of India,\" continues Professor Muller, \"confess that theirfeelings revolt against the impurities attributed to the gods by what they calltheir sacred writings; yet there are honest Brahmans who will maintain thatthese stories have a deeper meaning; that immorality being incompatible with adivine being, a mystery must be supposed to be concealed in these time-hallowedfables, a mystery which an inquiring and reverent mind may hope to fathom.\" This is precisely what the Christian clergy maintain in attempting to explainthe indecencies and incongruities of the Old Testament. Only, instead ofallowing the interpretation to those who have the key to these seemingincongruities, they have assumed to themselves the office and right, by divineproxy, to interpret these in their own way. They have not only done that buthave gradually deprived the Hebrew clergy of the means to interpret theirScriptures as their fathers did; so that to find among the Rabbis in the presentcentury a well-versed kabalist, is quite rare. The Jews have themselvesforgotten the key! How could they help it? Where are the original manuscripts?The oldest Hebrew manuscript in existence is said to be the Bodleian Codex,which is not older than between eight and nine hundred years. * The breakbetween Ezra and this Codex is thus fifteen centuries. In 1490 the Inquisitioncaused all the Hebrew Bibles to be burned; and Torquemada alone destroyed 6,000volumes at Salamanca. Except a few manuscripts of the Tora Ketubim and Nebiim,used in the synagogues, and which are of quite a recent date, we do not thinkthere is one old manuscript in existence which is not punctuated,hence--completely misinterpreted and altered by the Masorets. Were it not forthis timely invention of the Masorah, no copy of the Old Testament couldpossibly be tolerated in our century. It is well known that the Masorets whiletranscribing the oldest manuscripts put themselves to task to take out, exceptin a few places which they have probably overlooked, all the immodest words andput in places sentences of their own, often changing completely the sense of theverse. \"It is clear,\" says Donaldson, \"that the Masoretic school at Tiberiaswere engaged in settling or unsettling the Hebrew text until the finalpublication of the Masorah itself.\" Therefore, had we but the originaltexts--judging by the present copies of the Bible in our possession--it would bereally edifying to compare the Old Testament with the Vedas and even with theBrahmanical books. We verily believe that no faith, however blind, could standbefore such an avalanche of crude impurities and fables. If the latter are notonly accepted but enforced upon millions of civilized persons who find itrespectable and edifying to believe in them as divine revelation, why should wewonder that Brahmans believe their books to be equally a Sruti, a revelation? Let us thank the Masorets by all means, but let us study at the same time bothsides of the medal. Legends, myths, allegories, symbols, if they but belong to the Hindu, Chaldean,or Egyptian tradition, are thrown into the same heap of fiction. Hardly are theyhonored with a superficial search into their possible relations to astronomy orsexual emblems. The same myths--when and because mutilated--are accepted asSacred Scriptures, more--the Word of God! Is this impartial history? Is thisjustice to either the past, the present, or the future? \"Ye cannot serve God andMammon,\" said the Reformer, nineteen centuries ago. \"Ye cannot serve truth andpublic prejudice,\" would be more applicable to our own age. Yet our authoritiespretend they serve the former. There are few myths in any religious system but have an historical as well as ascientific foundation. Myths, as Pococke ably expresses it, \"are now proved tobe fables, just in proportion as we misunderstand them; truths, in proportion asthey were once understood. Our ignorance it is which has made a myth of history;and our ignorance is an Hellenic inheritance, much of it the result of Hellenicvanity.\" * Bunsen and Champollion have already shown that the Egyptian sacred books are byfar older than the oldest parts of the Book of Genesis. And now a more carefulresearch seems to warrant the suspicion--which with us amounts to a certainty,that the laws of Moses are copies from the code of the Brahmanic Manu. Thus,according to every probability, Egypt owes her civilization, her civilinstitutions, and her arts, to India. But against the latter assumption we havea whole army of \"authorities\" arrayed, and what matters if the latter do denythe fact at present? Sooner or later they will have to accept it, whether theybelong to the German or French school. Among, but not of those who so readilycompromise between interest and conscience, there are some fearless scholars,who may bring out to light incontrovertible facts. Some twenty years since, MaxMuller, in a letter to the Editor of the London Times, April, 1857, maintainedmost vehemently that Nirvana meant annihilation, in the fullest sense of theword. (See Chips, etc., vol. i., p. 287, on the meaning of Nirvana.) But in1869, in a lecture before the general meeting of the Association of GermanPhilologists at Kiel, \"he distinctly declares his belief that the nihilismattributed to Buddha's teaching forms no part of his doctrine, and that it iswholly wrong to suppose that Nirvana means annihilation.\" (Trubner's Americanand Oriental Literary Record, Oct. 16, 1869; also Inman's Ancient Faiths andModern, p. 128.) Yet if we mistake not, Professor Muller was as much of anauthority in 1857 as in 1869. \"It will be difficult to settle,\" says (now) this great scholar, \"whether theVedas is the oldest of books, and whether some of the portions of the OldTestament may not be traced back to the same or even an earlier date than theoldest hymns of the Veda.\" * But his retraction about the Nirvana allows us ahope that he may yet change his opinion on the question of Genesis likewise, sothat the public may have simultaneously the benefit of truth, and the sanctionof one of Europe's greatest authorities. It is well known how little the Orientalists have come to anything like anagreement about the age of Zoroaster, and until this question is settled, itwould be safer perhaps to trust implicitly in the Brahmanical calculations bythe Zodiac, than to the opinions of scientists. Leaving the profane horde ofunrecognized scholars, those we mean who yet wait their turn to be chosen forpublic worship as idols symbolical of scientific leadership, where can we find,among the sanctioned authorities of the day, two that agree as to this age?There's Bunsen, who places Zoroaster at Baktra, and the emigration of Baktriansto the Indus at 3784 B.C., ** and the birth of Moses at 1392. ***Now it israther difficult to place Zoroaster anterior to the Vedas, considering that thewhole of his doctrine is that of the earlier Vedas. True, he remained inAfghanistan for a period more or less problematical before crossing into thePunjab; but the Vedas were begun in the latter country. They indicate theprogress of the Hindus, as the Avesta that of the Iranians. And there is Haugwho assigns to the Aitareya Brahmanam--a Brahmanical speculation and commentaryupon the Rig-Veda of a far later date than the Veda itself--between 1400 and1200 B.C., while the Vedas are placed by him between 2,000 and 2,400 years B.C.Max Muller cautiously suggests certain difficulties in this chronologicalcomputation, but still does not altogether deny it. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_841] Let it, however, be as itmay, and supposing that the Pentateuch was written by Moseshimself--notwithstanding that he would thereby be made to twice record his owndeath--still, if Moses was born, as Bunsen finds, in 1392 B.C., the Pentateuchcould not have been written before the Vedas. Especially if Zoroaster was born3784 B.C. If, as Dr. Haug **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_842] tells us, some of thehymns of the Rig-Veda were written before Zoroaster accomplished his schism,something like thirty-seven centuries B.C., and Max Muller says himself that\"the Zoroastrians and their ancestors started from India during the Vaidicperiod,\" how can some of the portions of the Old Testament be traced back to thesame or even \"an earlier date than the oldest hymns of the Veda\"? It has generally been agreed among Orientalists that the Aryans, 3,000 yearsB.C., were still in the steppes east of the Caspian, and united. Rawlinsonconjectures that they \"flowed east\" from Armenia as a common centre; while twokindred streams began to flow, one northward over the Caucasus, and the otherwestward over Asia Minor and Europe. He finds the Aryans, at a period anteriorto the fifteenth century before our era, \"settled in the territory watered bythe Upper Indus.\" Thence Vedic Aryans migrated to the Punjab, and Zendic Aryanswestward, establishing the historical countries. But this, like the rest, is ahypothesis, and only given as such. Again, Rawlinson, evidently following Max Muller, says: \"The early history ofthe Aryans is for many ages an absolute blank.\" But many learned Brahmans,however, have declared that they found trace of the existence of the Vedas asearly as 2100 B.C.; and Sir William Jones, taking for his guide the astronomicaldata, places the Yagur-Veda 1580 B.C. This would be still \"before Moses.\" It is upon the supposition that the Aryans did not leave Afghanistan for thePunjab prior to 1500 B.C. that Max Muller and other Oxford savants have supposedthat portions of the Old Testament may be traced back to the same or even anearlier date than the oldest hymns of the Veda. Therefore, until theOrientalists can show us the correct date at which Zoroaster flourished, noauthority can be regarded as better for the ages of the Vedas than the Brahmansthemselves. As it is a recognized fact that the Jews borrowed most of their laws from theEgyptians, let us examine who were the Egyptians. In our opinion--which is but apoor authority, of course--they were the ancient Indians, and in our firstvolume we have quoted passages from the historian Collouca-Batta that supportsuch a theory. What we mean by ancient India is the following: No region on the map--except it be the ancient Scythia--is more uncertainlydefined than that which bore the designation of India. Æthiopia is perhaps theonly parallel. It was the home of the Cushite or Hamitic races, and lay to theeast of Babylonia. It was once the name of Hindustan, when the dark races,worshippers of Bala-Mahadeva and Bhavani-Mahidevi, were supreme in that country.The India of the early sages appears to have been the region at the sources ofthe Oxus and Jaxartes. Apollonius of Tyana crossed the Caucasus, or Hindu Kush,where he met with a king who directed him to the abode of the sages--perhaps thedescendants of those whom Ammianus terms the \"Brahmans of Upper India,\" and whomHystaspes, the father of Darius (or more probably Darius Hystaspes himself)visited; and, having been instructed by them, infused their rites and ideas intothe Magian observances. This narrative about Apollonius seems to indicateKashmere as the country which he visited, and the Nagas--after their conversionto Buddhism--as his teachers. At this time Aryan India did not extend beyond thePunjab. To our notion, the most baffling impediment in the way of ethnological progresshas always been the triple progeny of Noah. In the attempt to reconcilepostdiluvian races with a genealogical descent from Shem, Ham, and Japhet, theChristianesque Orientalists have set themselves a task impossible ofaccomplishment. The biblical Noachian ark has been a Procrustean bed to whichthey had to make everything fit. Attention has therefore been diverted fromveritable sources of information as to the origin of man, and a purely localallegory mistaken for a historical record emanating from an inspired source.Strange and unfortunate choice! Out of all the sacred writings of all the branchnations, sprung from the primitive stock of mankind, Christianity must choosefor its guidance the national records and scriptures of a people perhaps theleast spiritual of the human family--the Semitic. A branch that has never beenable to develop out of its numerous tongues a language capable of embodyingideas of a moral and intellectual world; whose form of expression and drift ofthought could never soar higher than the purely sensual and terrestrial figuresof speech; whose literature has left nothing original, nothing that was notborrowed from the Aryan thought; and whose science and philosophy are utterlywanting in those noble features which characterize the highly spiritual andmetaphysical systems of the Indo-European (Japetic) races. Bunsen shows Khamism (the language of Egypt) as a very ancient deposit fromWestern Asia, containing the germs of the Semitic, and thus bearing \"witness tothe primitive cognate unity of the Semitic and Aryan races.\" We must remember,in this connection, that the peoples of Southwestern and Western Asia, includingthe Medes, were all Aryans. It is yet far from being proved who were theoriginal and primitive masters of India. That this period is now beyond thereach of documentary history, does not preclude the probability of our theorythat it was the mighty race of builders, whether we call them EasternÆthiopians, or dark-skinned Aryans (the word meaning simply \"noble warrior,\" a\"brave\"). They ruled supreme at one time over the whole of ancient India,enumerated later by Manu as the possession of those whom our scientists term theSanscrit-speaking people. These Hindus are supposed to have entered the country from the northwest; theyare conjectured by some to have brought with them the Brahmanical religion, andthe language of the conquerors was probably the Sanscrit. On these three meagredata our philologists have worked ever since the Hindustani and its immenseSanscrit literature was forcibly brought into notice by Sir William Jones--allthe time with the three sons of Noah clinging around their necks. This is exactscience, free from religious prejudices! Verily, ethnology would have been thegainer if this Noachian trio had been washed overboard and drowned before theark reached land! The Æthiopians are generally classed in the Semitic group; but we have to seehow far they have a claim to such a classification. We will also consider howmuch they might have had to do with the Egyptian civilization, which, as awriter expresses it, seems referable in the same perfection to the earliestdates, and not to have had a rise and progress, as was the case with that ofother peoples. For reasons that we will now adduce, we are prepared to maintainthat Egypt owes her civilization, commonwealth and arts--especially the art ofbuilding, to pre-Vedic India, and that it was a colony of the dark-skinnedAryans, or those whom Homer and Herodotus term the eastern Æthiopians, i.e., theinhabitants of Southern India, who brought to it their ready-made civilizationin the ante-chronological ages, of what Bunsen calls the pre-Menite, butnevertheless epochal history. In Pococke's India in Greece, we find the following suggestive paragraph: \"Theplain account of the wars carried on between the solar chiefs, Oosras (Osiris)the prince of the Guclas, and 'TU-PHOO' is the simple historical fact of thewars of the Apians, or Sun-tribes of Oude, with the people of 'TU-PHOO' orTHIBET, who were, in fact, the lunar race, mostly Buddhists * and opposed byRama and the 'AITYO-PIAS' or people of Oude, subsequently the AITH-IO-PIANS ofAfrica.\" ** We would remind the reader in this connection, that Ravan, the giant, who, inthe Ramayana, wages such a war with Rama Chandra, is shown as King of Lanka,which was the ancient name for Ceylon; and that Ceylon, in those days, perhapsformed part of the main-land of Southern India, and was peopled by the \"EasternÆthiopians.\" Conquered by Rama, the son of Dasarata, the Solar King of ancientOude, a colony of these emigrated to Northern Africa. If, as many suspect,Homer's Iliad and much of his account of the Trojan war is plagiarized from theRamayana, then the traditions which served as a basis for the latter must datefrom a tremendous antiquity. Ample margin is thus left in pre-chronologicalhistory for a period, during which the \"Eastern Æthiopians\" might haveestablished the hypothetical Mizraic colony, with their high Indian civilizationand arts. Science is still in the dark about cuneiform inscriptions. Until these arecompletely deciphered, especially those cut in rocks found in such abundancewithin the boundaries of the old Iran, who can tell the secrets they may yetreveal? There are no Sanscrit monumental inscriptions older than Chandragupta(315 B.C.), and the Persepolitan inscriptions are found 220 years older. Thereare even now some manuscripts in characters utterly unknown to philologists andpalaeographists, and one of them is, or was, some time since in the library ofCambridge, England. Linguistic writers class the Semitic with the Indo-Europeanlanguage, generally including the Æthiopian and the ancient Egyptian in theclassification. But if some of the dialects of the modern Northern Africa, andeven the modern Gheez or Æthiopian, are now so degenerated and corrupted as toadmit of false conclusions as to the genetical relationship between them and theother Semitic tongues, we are not at all sure that the latter have any claim tosuch a classification, except in the case of the old Coptic and the ancientGheez. That there is more consanguinity between the Æthiopians and the Aryan,dark-skinned races, and between the latter and the Egyptians, is something whichyet may be proved. It has been lately found that the ancient Egyptians were ofthe Caucasian type of mankind, and the shape of their skulls is purelyAsiatic. * If they were less copper-colored than the Æthiopians of our modernday, the Æthiopians themselves might have had a lighter complexion in days ofold. The fact that, with the Æthiopian kings, the order of succession gave thecrown to the nephew of the king, the son of his sister, and not to his own son,is extremely suggestive. It is an old custom which prevails until now inSouthern India. The Rajah is not succeeded by his own sons, but by his sister'ssons. ** Of all the dialects and tongues alleged to be Semitic, the Æthiopian alone iswritten from left to right like the Sanscrit and the Indo-Aryan people. *** Thus, against the origin of the Egyptians being attributed to an ancient Indiancolony, there is no graver impediment than Noah's disrespectfulson--Ham--himself a myth. But the earliest form of Egyptian religious worshipand government, theocratic and sacerdotal, and her habits and customs allbespeak an Indian origin. The earliest legends of the history of India mention two dynasties now lost inthe night of time; the first was the dynasty of kings, of \"the race of the sun,\"who reigned in Ayodhia (now Oude); the second that of the \"race of the moon,\"who reigned in Pruyag (Allahabad). Let him who desires information on thereligious worship of these early kings read the Book of the Dead, of theEgyptians, and all the peculiarities attending this sun-worship and thesun-gods. Neither Osiris nor Horus are ever mentioned without being connectedwith the sun. They are the \"Sons of the Sun\"; \"the Lord and Adorer of the Sun\"is his name. \"The sun is the creator of the body, the engenderer of the gods whoare the successors of the Son.\" Pococke, in his most ingenious work, stronglyadvocates the same idea, and endeavors to establish still more firmly theidentity of the Egyptian, Greek, and Indian mythology. He shows the head of theRajpoot Solar race--in fact the great Cuclo-pos (Cyclop or builder)--called \"Thegreat sun,\" in the earliest Hindu tradition. This Gok-la Prince, the patriarchof the vast bands of Inachienses, he says, \"this Great Sun was deified at hisdeath, and according to the Indian doctrine of the metempsychosis, his Soul wassupposed to have transmigrated into the bull 'Apis,' the Sera-pis of the Greeks,and the SOORAPAS, or 'Sun-Chief' of the Egyptians. . . . Osiris, properlyOosras, signifies both 'a bull,' and 'a ray of light.' Soora-pas (Serapis) thesun chief,\" for the Sun in Sanscrit is Surya. Champollion's Manifestation to theLight, reminds in every chapter of the two Dynasties of the Kings of the Sun andthe Moon. Later, these kings became all deified and transformed after death intosolar and lunar deities. Their worship was the earliest corruption of the greatprimitive faith which justly considered the sun and its fiery life-giving raysas the most appropriate symbol to remind us of the universal invisible presenceof Him who is master of Life and Death. And now it can be traced all around theglobe. It was the religion of the earliest Vedic Brahmans, who call, in theoldest hymns of the Rig-Veda, Surya (the sun) and Agni (fire) \"the ruler of theuniverse,\" \"the lord of men,\" and the \"wise king.\" It was the worship of theMagians, the Zoroastrians, the Egyptians and Greeks, whether they called himMithra, or Ahura-Mazda, or Osiris, or Zeus, keeping in honor of his next of kin,Vesta, the pure celestial fire. And this religion is found again in the Peruviansolar-worship; in the Sabianism and heliolatry of the Chaldees, in the Mosaic\"burning bush,\" the hanging of the heads or chiefs of the people toward theLord, the \"Sun,\" and even in the Abrahamic building of fire-altars and thesacrifices of the monotheistic Jews, to Astarte the Queen of Heaven. To the present moment, with all the controversies and researches, History andScience remain as much as ever in the dark as to the origin of the Jews. Theymay as well be the exiled Tchandalas, or Pariahs, of old India, the\"bricklayers\" mentioned by Vina-Svati, Veda-Vyasa and Manu, as the Phoeniciansof Herodotus, or the Hyk-sos of Josephus, or descendants of Pali shepherds, or amixture of all these. The Bible names the Tyrians as a kindred people, andclaims dominion over them. * There is more than one important character in the Bible, whose biography proveshim a mythical hero. Samuel is indicated as the personage of the HebrewCommonwealth. He is the doppel of Samson, of the Book of Judges, as will beseen--being the son of Anna and EL-KAINA, as Samson was of Manua or Manoah. Bothwere fictitious characters, as now represented in the revealed book; one was theHebrew Hercules, and the other Ganesa. Samuel is credited with establishing therepublic, as putting down the Canaanite worship of Baal and Astarte, or Adonisand Venus, and setting up that of Jehovah. Then the people demanded a king, andhe anointed Saul, and after him David of Bethlehem. David is the Israelitish King Arthur. He did great achievements and establisheda government in all Syria and Idumea. His dominion extended from Armenia andAssyria on the north and north-east, the Syrian Desert and Persian Gulf on theEast, Arabia on the south, and Egypt and the Levant on the west. Only Phoeniciawas excepted. His friendship with Hiram seems to indicate that he made his first expeditionfrom that country into Judea; and his long residence at Hebron, the city of theKabeiri (Arba or four), would seem likewise to imply that he established a newreligion in the country. After David came Solomon, powerful and luxurious, who sought to consolidate thedominion which David had won. As David was a Jehovah-worshipper, a temple ofJehovah (Tukt Suleima) was built in Jerusalem, while shrines of Moloch-Hercules,Khemosh, and Astarte were erected on Mount Olivet. These shrines remained tillJosiah. There were conspiracies formed. Revolts took place in Idumea and Damascus; andAhijah the prophet led the popular movement which resulted in deposing the houseof David and making Jeroboam king. Ever after the prophets dominated in Israel,where the calf-worship prevailed; the priests ruled over the weak dynasty ofDavid, and the lascivious local worship existed over the whole country. Afterthe destruction of the house of Ahab, and the failure of Jehu and hisdescendants to unite the country under one head, the endeavor was made in Judah.Isaiah had terminated the direct line in the person of Ahaz (Isaiah vii. 9), andplaced on the throne a prince from Bethlehem (Micah v. 2, 5). This was Hezekiah.On ascending the throne, he invited the chiefs of Israel to unite in alliancewith him against Assyria (2 Chronicles, xxx. 1, 21; xxxi. 1, 5; 2 Kings, xviii.7). He seems to have established a sacred college (Proverbs xxv. 1), and to haveutterly changed the worship. Aye, even unto breaking into pieces the brazenserpent that Moses had made. This makes the story of Samuel and David and Solomon mythical. Most of theprophets who were literate seem to have begun about this time to write. The country was finally overthrown by the Assyrians, who found the same peopleand institutions as in the Phoenician and other countries. Hezekiah was not the lineal, but the titular son of Ahaz. Isaiah, the prophet,belonged to the royal family, and Hezekiah was reputed his son-in-law. Ahazrefused to ally himself with the prophet and his party, saying: \"I will nottempt (depend on) the Lord\" (Isaiah vii. 12). The prophet had declared: \"If youwill not believe, surely you shall not be established\"--foreshadowing thedeposition of his direct language. \"Ye weary my God,\" replied the prophet, andpredicted the birth of a child by an alma, or temple-woman, and that before itshould attain full age (Hebrews v. 14; Isaiah vii. 16; viii. 4), the king ofAssyria should overcome Syria and Israel. This is the prophecy which Irenaeustook such pains to connect with Mary and Jesus, and made the reason why themother of the Nazarene prophet is represented as belonging to the temple, andconsecrated to God from her infancy. In a second song, Isaiah celebrated the new chief, to sit on the throne of David(ix. 6, 7; xi. 1), who should restore to their homes the Jews whom theconfederacy had led captive (Isaiah viii. 2-12; Joel iii. 1-7; Obadiah 7, 11,14). Micah--his contemporary--also announced the same event (iv. 7-13; v. 1-7).The Redeemer was to come out of Bethlehem; in other words, was of the house ofDavid; and was to resist Assyria to whom Ahaz had sworn allegiance, and also toreform religion (2 Kings, xviii. 4-8). This Hezekiah did. He was grandson ofZechariah the seer (2 Chronicles, xxix. 1; xxvi. 5), the counsellor of Uzziah;and as soon as he ascended the throne he restored the religion of David, anddestroyed the last vestiges of that of Moses, i.e., the esoteric doctrine,declaring \"our fathers have trespassed\" (2 Chron., xxix. 6-9). He next attempteda reunion with the northern monarchy,there being an interregnum in Israel (2Chron., xxx. 1, 2, 6; xxxi. 1, 6, 7). It was successful, but resulted in aninvasion by the king of Assyria. But it was a new regime; and all this shows thecourse of two parallel streams in the religious worship of the Israelites; onebelonging to the state religion and adopted to fit political exigencies; theother pure idolatry, resulting from ignorance of the true esoteric doctrinepreached by Moses. For the first time since Solomon built them \"the high placeswere taken away.\" It was Hezekiah who was the expected Messiah of the exoteric state-religion. Hewas the scion from the stem of Jesse, who should recall the Jews from adeplorable captivity, about which the Hebrew historians seem to be very silent,carefully avoiding all mention of this particular fact, but which the irascibleprophets imprudently disclose. If Hezekiah crushed the exoteric Baal-worship, healso tore violently away the people of Israel from the religion of theirfathers, and the secret rites instituted by Moses. It was Darius Hystaspes who was the first to establish a Persian colony inJudea, Zoro-Babel was perhaps the leader. \"The name Zoro-babel means 'the seedor son of Babylon'--as Zoro-aster [images/00088.jpg]is the seed, son, or princeof Ishtar.\" * The new colonists were doubtless Judaei. This is a designationfrom the East. Even Siam is called Judia, and there was an Ayodia in India. Thetemples of Solom or Peace were numerous. Throughout Persia and Afghanistan thenames of Saul and David are very common. The \"Law\" is ascribed in turn toHezekiah, Ezra, Simon the Just, and the Asmonean period. Nothing definite;everywhere contradictions. When the Asmonean period began, the chief supportersof the Law were called Asideans or Khasdim (Chaldeans), and afterward Phariseesor Pharsi (Parsis). This indicates that Persian colonies were established inJudea and ruled the country; while all the people that are mentioned in thebooks of Genesis and Joshua lived there as a commonalty (see Ezra ix. 1). There is no real history in the Old Testament, and the little historicalinformation one can glean is only found in the indiscreet revelations of theprophets. The book, as a whole, must have been written at various times, orrather invented as an authorization of some subsequent worship, the origin ofwhich may be very easily traced partially to the Orphic Mysteries, and partiallyto the ancient Egyptian rites in familiarity with which Moses was brought upfrom his infancy. Since the last century the Church has been gradually forced into concessions ofusurped biblical territory to those to whom it of right belonged.Inch by inchhas been yielded, and one personage after another been proved mythical andPagan. But now, after the recent discovery of George Smith, the much-regrettedAssyriologist, one of the securest props of the Bible has been pulled down.Sargon and his tablets are about demonstrated to be older than Moses. Like theaccount of Exodus, the birth and story of the lawgiver seem to have been\"borrowed\" from the Assyrians, as the \"jewels of gold and jewels of silver\" weresaid to be from the Egyptians. On page 224 of Assyrian Discoveries, Mr. George Smith says: \"In the palace ofSennacherib at Kouyunjik, I found another fragment of the curious history ofSargon, a translation of which I published in the Transactions of the Society ofBiblical Archaeology, vol. i., part i., page 46. This text relates that Sargon,an early Babylonian monarch, was born of royal parents, but concealed by hismother, who placed him on the Euphrates in an ark of rushes, coated withbitumen, like that in which the mother of Moses hid her child (see Exodus ii.).Sargon was discovered by a man named Akki, a water-carrier, who adopted him ashis son; and he afterward became King of Babylonia. The capital of Sargon wasthe great city of Agadi--called by the Semites Akkad--mentioned in Genesis as acapital of Nimrod (Genesis x. l0), and here he reigned for forty-five years. *Akkad lay near the city of Sippara, ** on the Euphrates and north of Babylon.\"The date of Sargon, who may be termed the Babylonian Moses, was in thesixteenth century and perhaps earlier.\" G. Smith adds in his Chaldean Account that Sargon I. was a Babylonian monarchwho reigned in the city of Akkad about 1600 B.C. The name of Sargon signifiesthe right, true, or legitimate king. This curious story is found on fragments oftablets from Kouyunjik, and reads as follows: 1. Sargona, the powerful king, the king of Akkad am I.2. My mother was a princess, my father I did not know, a brother of my fatherruled over the country.3. In the city of Azupirana, which is by the side of the river Euphrates,4. My mother, the princess, conceived me; in difficulty she brought me forth.5. She placed me in an ark of rushes, with bitumen my exit she sealed up.6. She launched me in the river which did not drown me.7. The river carried me to Akki, the water-carrier it brought me.8. Akki, the water-carrier, in tenderness of bowels, lifted me, etc., etc.And now Exodus (ii.): \"And when she (Moses' mother) could not longer hide him,she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch,and put the child therein, and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.\" The story, says Mr. G. Smith, \"is supposed to have happened about 1600 B.C.,rather earlier than the supposed age of Moses * as we know that the fame ofSargon reached Egypt, it is quite likely that this account had a connection withthe event related in Exodus ii., for every action, when once performed, has atendency to be repeated.\" The \"ages\" of the Hindus differ but little from those of the Greeks, Romans, andeven the Jews. We include the Mosaic computation advisedly, and with intent toprove our position. The chronology which separates Moses from the creation ofthe world by only four generations seems ridiculous, merely because theChristian clergy would enforce it upon the world literally. ** The kabalistsknow that these generations stand for ages of the world. The allegories which,in the Hindu calculations, embrace the whole stupendous sweep of the four ages,are cunningly made in the Mosaic books, through the obliging help of theMasorah, to cram into the small period of two millenniums and a half (2513)! The exoteric plan of the Bible was made to answer also to four ages. Thus, theyreckon the Golden Age from Adam to Abraham; the silver, from Abraham to David;copper, from David to the Captivity; thenceforward, the iron. But the secretcomputation is quite different, and does not vary at all from the zodiacalcalculations of the Brahmans. We are in the Iron Age, or Kali-Yug, but it beganwith Noah, the mythical ancestor of our race. Noah, or Nuah, like all the euhemerized manifestations of the UnrevealedOne--Swayambhuva (or Swayambhu), was androgyne. Thus, in some instances, hebelonged to the purely feminine triad of the Chaldeans, known as \"Nuah, theuniversal Mother.\" We have shown, in another chapter, that every male triad hadits feminine counterpart, one in three, like the former. It was the passivecomplement of the active principle, its reflection. In India, the male trimurtyis reproduced in the Sakti-trimurti, the feminine; and in Chaldea, Ana, Belitaand Davkina answered to Anu, Bel, Nuah. The former three resumed in one--Belita,were called: \"Sovereign goddess, lady of the nether abyss, mother of gods, queen of theearth, queen of fecundity.\" As the primordial humidity, whence proceeded all, Belita is Tamti, or the sea,the mother of the city of Erech (the great Chaldean necropolis), therefore, aninfernal goddess. In the world of stars and planets she is known as Istar orAstoreth. Hence, she is identical with Venus, and every other queen of heaven,to whom cakes and buns were offered in sacrifice, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_854] and, as all thearchaeologists know, with Eve, the mother of all that live, and with Mary. The Ark, in which are preserved the germs of all living things necessary torepeople the earth, represents the survival of life, and the supremacy of spiritover matter, through the conflict of the opposing powers of nature. In theAstro-Theosophic chart of the Western Rite, the Ark corresponds with the navel,and is placed at the sinister side, the side of the woman (the moon), one ofwhose symbols is the left pillar of Solomon's temple--Boaz. The umbilicus isconnected with the receptacle in which are fructified the germs of the race. **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_855] The Ark is the sacredArgha of the Hindus, and thus, the relation in which it stands to Noah's ark maybe easily inferred, when we learn that the Argha was an oblong vessel, used bythe high priests as a sacrificial chalice in the worship of Isis, Astarte, andVenus-Aphrodite, all of whom were goddesses of the generative powers of nature,or of matter--hence, representing symbolically the Ark containing the germs ofall living things. We admit that Pagans had and now have--as in India--strange symbols, which, tothe eyes of the hypocrite and Puritan, seem scandalously immoral. But did notthe ancient Jews copy most of these symbols? We have described elsewhere theidentity of the lingham with Jacob's pillar, and we could give a number ofinstances from the present Christian rites, bearing the same origin, did butspace permit, and were not all these noticed fully by Inman and others (SeeInman's Ancient Faiths Embodied in Ancient Names). Describing the worship of the Egyptians, Mrs. Lydia Maria Child says: \"Thisreverence for the production of life, introduced into the worship of Osiris, thesexual emblems so common in Hindustan. A colossal image of this kind waspresented to his temple in Alexandria, by King Ptolemy Philadelphus. . . .Reverence for the mystery of organized life led to the recognition of amasculine and feminine principle in all things, spiritual or material. . . . Thesexual emblems, everywhere conspicuous in the sculptures of their temples, wouldseem impure in description, but no clean and thoughtful mind could so regardthem while witnessing the obvious simplicity and solemnity with which thesubject is treated.\" * Thus speaks this respected lady and admirable writer, and no truly pure man orwoman would ever think of blaming her for it. But such a perversion of theancient thought is but natural in an age of cant and prudery like our own. The water of the flood when standing in the allegory for the symbolic \"sea,\"Tamti, typifies the turbulent chaos, or matter, called \"the great dragon.\"According to the Gnostic and Rosicrucian medaeival doctrine, the creation ofwoman was not originally intended. She is the offspring of man's own impurefancy, and, as the Hermetists say, \"an obtrusion.\" Created by an unclean thoughtshe sprang into existence at the evil \"seventh hour,\" when the \"supernatural\"real worlds had passed away and the \"natural\" or delusive worlds began evolvingalong the \"descending Microcosmos,\" or the arc of the great cycle, in plainerphraseology. First \"Virgo,\" the Celestial Virgin of the Zodiac, she became\"Virgo-Scorpio.\" But in evolving his second companion, man had unwittinglyendowed her with his own share of Spirituality; and the new being whom his\"imagination\" had called into life became his \"Saviour\" from the snares ofEve-Lilith, the first Eve, who had a greater share of matter in her compositionthan the primitive \"spiritual\" man. ** Thus woman stands in the cosmogony in relation to \"matter\" or the great deep, asthe \"Virgin of the Sea,\" who crushes the \"Dragon\" under her foot. The \"Flood\" isalso very often shown, in symbolical phraseology, as the \"great Dragon.\" For oneacquainted with these tenets it becomes more than suggestive to learn that withthe Catholics the Virgin Mary is not only the accepted patroness of Christiansailors, but also the \"Virgin of the Sea.\" So was Dido the patroness of thePhoenician mariners; * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_858] andtogether with Venus and other lunar goddesses--the moon having such a stronginfluence over the tides--was the \"Virgin of the Sea.\" Mar, the Sea, is the rootof the name Mary. The blue color, which was with the ancients symbolical of the\"Great Deep\" or the material world, hence--of evil, is made sacred to our\"Blessed Lady.\" It is the color of \"Notre Dame de Paris.\" On account of itsrelation to the symbolical serpent this color is held in the deepest aversion bythe ex-Nazarenes, disciples of John the Baptist, now the Mendaeans of Basra. Among the beautiful plates of Maurice, there is one representing Christnacrushing the head of the Serpent. A three-peaked mitre is on his head (typifyingthe trinity), and the body and tail of the conquered serpent encircles thefigure of the Hindu god. This plate shows whence proceeded the inspiration forthe \"make up\" of a later story extracted from an alleged prophecy. \"I will putenmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shallbruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\" The Egyptian Orante is also shown with his arms extended as on a crucifix, andtreading upon the \"Serpent\"; and Horus (the Logos) is represented piercing thehead of the dragon, Typhon or Aphophis. All this gives us a clew to the biblicalallegory of Cain and Abel. Cain was held as the ancestor of the Hivites, theSerpents, and the twins of Adam are an evident copy from the fable of Osiris andTyphon. Apart from the external form of the allegory, however, it embodied thephilosophical conception of the eternal struggle of good and evil. But how strangely elastic, how adaptable to any and every thing this mysticalphilosophy proved after the Christian era! When were ever facts, irrefutable,irrefragable, and beyond denial, less potential for the reestablishment of truththan in our century of casuistry and Christian cunning? Is Christna proved tohave been known as the \"Good Shepherd\" ages before the year A.D. 1, to havecrushed the Serpent Kalinaga, and to have been crucified--all this was but aprophetic foreshadowing of the future! Are the Scandinavian Thor, who bruisedthe head of the Serpent with his cruciform mace, and Apollo, who killed Python,likewise shown to present the most striking similarities with the heroes of theChristian fables; they become but original conceptions of \"heathen\" minds,\"working upon the old Patriarchal prophecies respecting the Christ, as they werecontained in the one universal and primeval Revelation\"! * The flood, then, is the \"Old Serpent\" or the great deep of matter, Isaiah's\"dragon in the sea\" (xxvii. 1), over which the ark safely crosses on its way tothe mount of Salvation. But, if we have heard of the ark and Noah, and the Bibleat all, it is because the mythology of the Egyptians was ready at hand for Moses(if Moses ever wrote any of the Bible), and that he was acquainted with thestory of Horus, standing on his boat of a serpentine form, and killing theSerpent with his spear; and with the hidden meaning of these fables, and theirreal origin. This is also why we find in Leviticus, and other parts of hisbooks, whole pages of laws identical with those of Manu. The animals shut up in the ark are the human passions. They typify certainordeals of initiation, and the mysteries which were instituted among manynations in commemoration of this allegory. Noah's ark rested on the seventeenthof the seventh month. Here we have again the number; as also in the \"cleanbeasts\" that he took by sevens into the ark. Speaking of the water-mysteries ofByblos, Lucian says: \"On the top of one of the two pillars which Bacchus set up,a man remains seven days.\" ** He supposes this was done to honor Deukalion.Elijah, when praying on the top of Mount Carmel, sends his servant to look for acloud toward the sea, and repeats, \"go again seven times. And it came to pass atthe seventh time, behold there arose a little cloud out of the sea like a man'shand.\" *** \"Noah is a revolutio of Adam, as Moses is a revolutio of Abel and Seth,\" saysthe Kabala; that is to say, a repetition or another version of the same story.The greatest proof of it is the distribution of the characters in the Bible. Forinstance, beginning with Cain, the first murderer, every fifth man in his lineof descent is a murderer. Thus there come Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methuselah, andthe fifth is Lamech, the second murderer, and he is Noah's father. By drawingthe five-pointed star of Lucifer (which has its crown-point downward) andwriting the name of Cain beneath the lowest point, and those of his descendantssuccessively at each of the other points, it will be found that each fifthname--which would be written beneath that of Cain--is that of a murderer. In theTalmud this genealogy is given complete, and thirteen murderers range themselvesin line below the name of Cain. This is no coincidence. Siva is the Destroyer,but he is also the Regenerator. Cain is a murderer, but he is also the creatorof nations, and an inventor. This star of Lucifer is the same one that John seesfalling down to earth in his Apocalypse. In Thebes, or Theba, which means ark--TH-ABA being synonymous with Kartha orTyre, Astu or Athens and Urbs or Rome, and meaning also the city--are found thesame foliations as described on the pillars of the temple of Solomon. Thebicolored leaf of the olive, the three-lobed figleaf, and the lanceolate-shapedlaurel-leaf, had all esoteric as well as popular or vulgar meanings with theancients. The researches of Egyptologists present another corroboration of the identity ofthe Bible-allegories with those of the lands of the Pharaohs and Chaldeans. Thedynastic chronology of the Egyptians, recorded by Herodotus, Manetho,Eratosthenes, Diodorus Siculus, and accepted by our antiquarians, divided theperiod of Egyptian history under four general heads: the dominion of gods,demi-gods, heroes, and mortal men. By combining the demi-gods and heroes intoone class, Bunsen reduces the periods to three: the ruling gods, the demi-godsor heroes--sons of gods, but born of mortal mothers--and the Manes, who were theancestors of individual tribes. These subdivisions, as any one may perceive,correspond perfectly with the biblical Elohim, sons of God, giants, and mortalNoachian men. Diodorus of Sicily and Berosus give us the names of the twelve great gods whopresided over the twelve months of the year and the twelve signs of the zodiac.These names, which include Nuah, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_862] are too well known torequire repetition. The double-faced Janus was also at the head of twelve gods,and in his representations of him he is made to hold the keys to the celestialdomains. All these having served as models for the biblical patriarchs, havedone still further service--especially Janus--by furnishing copy to St. Peterand his twelve apostles, the former also double-faced in his denial, and alsorepresented as holding the keys of Paradise. This statement that the story of Noah is but another version in its hiddenmeaning of the story of Adam and his three sons, gathers proof on every page ofthe book of Genesis. Adam is the prototype of Noah. Adam falls because he eatsof the forbidden fruit of celestial knowledge; Noah, because he tastes of theterrestrial fruit: the juice of the grape representing the abuse of knowledge inan unbalanced mind. Adam gets stripped of his spiritual envelope; Noah of histerrestrial clothing; and the nakedness of both makes them feel ashamed. Thewickedness of Cain is repeated in Ham. But the descendants of both are shown asthe wisest of races on earth; and they are called on this account \"snakes,\" andthe \"sons of snakes,\" meaning the sons of wisdom, and not of Satan, as somedivines would be pleased to have the world understand the term. Enmity has beenplaced between the \"snake\" and the \"woman\" only in this mortal phenomenal \"worldof man\" as \"born of woman.\" Before the carnal fall, the \"snake\" was Ophis, thedivine wisdom, which needed no matter to procreate men, humanity being utterlyspiritual. Hence the war between the snake and the woman, or between spirit andmatter. If, in its material aspect, the \"old serpent\" is matter, and representsOphiomorphos, in its spiritual meaning it becomes Ophis-Christos. In the magicof the old Syro-Chaldeans both are conjoint in the zodiacal sign of theandrogyne of Virgo-Scorpio, and may be divided or separated whenever needed.Thus as the origin of \"good and evil,\" the meaning of the S.S. and Z.Z. hasalways been interchangeable; and if upon some occasions the S.S. on sigils andtalismans are suggestive of serpentine evil influence and denote a design ofblack magic upon others, the double S.S. are found on the sacramental cups ofthe Church and mean the presence of the Holy Ghost, or pure wisdom. The Midianites were known as the wise men, or sons of snakes, as well asCanaanites and Hamites; and such was the renown of the Midianites, that we findMoses, the prophet, led on, and inspired by \"the Lord,\" humbling himself beforeHobab, the son of Raguel, the Midianite, and beseeching him to remain with thepeople of Israel: \"Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how weare to encamp IN THE WILDERNESS, thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.\" *Further, when Moses sends spies to search out the land of Canaan, they bring asa proof of the wisdom (kabalistically speaking) and goodness of the land, abranch with one cluster of grapes, which they are compelled to bear between twomen on a staff. Moreover, they add: \"we saw the children of ANAK there.\" They are the giants, the sons of Anak, \"which come of the giants, * and we werein our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.\" ** Anak is Enoch, the patriarch, who dies not, and who is the first possessor ofthe \"mirific name,\" according to the Kabala, and the ritual of Freemasonry. Comparing the biblical patriarchs with the descendants of Vaiswasvata, the HinduNoah, and the old Sanscrit traditions about the deluge in the BrahmanicalMahabharata, we find them mirrored in the Vaidic patriarchs who are theprimitive types upon which all the others were modelled. But before comparisonis possible, the Hindu myths must be comprehended in their true significance.Each of these mythical personages bears, besides an astronomical significance, aspiritual or moral, and an anthropological or physical meaning. The patriarchsare not only euhemerized gods--the prediluvian answering to the twelve greatgods of Berosus, and to the ten Pradjapati, and the postdiluvian to the sevengods of the famous tablet in the Ninevean Library, but they stand also as thesymbols of the Greek Æons, the kabalistic Sephiroth, and the zodiacal signs, astypes of a series of human races. *** This variation from ten to twelve will beaccounted for presently, and proved on the very authority of the Bible. Only,they are not the first gods described by Cicero, * which belong to a hierarchyof higher powers, the Elohim--but appertain rather to the second class of the\"twelve gods,\" the Dii minores, and who are the terrestrial reflections of thefirst, among whom Herodotus places Hercules. ** Alone, out of the group oftwelve, Noah, by reason of his position at the transitional point, belongs tothe highest Babylonian triad, Noah, the spirit of the waters. The rest areidentical with the inferior gods of Assyria and Babylonia, who represented thelower order of emanations, introduced around Bel, the Demiurge, and help him inhis work, as the patriarchs are shown to assist Jehovah--the \"Lord God.\" Besides these, many of which were local gods, the protecting deities of riversand cities, there were the four classes of genius, we see Ezekiel making themsupport the throne of Jehovah in his vision. A fact which, if it identifies theJewish \"Lord God\" with one of the Babylonian trinity, connects, at the sametime, the present Christian God with the same triad, inasmuch as it is thesefour cherubs, if the reader will remember, on which Irenaeus makes Jesus ride,and which are shown as the companions of the evangelists. The Hindu kabalistic derivation of the books of Ezekiel and Revelation are shownin nothing more plainly than in this description of the four beasts, whichtypify the four elementary kingdoms--earth, air, fire, and water. As is wellknown, they are the Assyrian sphinxes, but these figures are also carved on thewalls of nearly every Hindu pagoda. The author of the Revelation copies faithfully in his text (see chap. iv., verse7) the Pythagorean pentacle, of which Levi's admirable sketch is reproduced onpage 452. The Hindu goddess Adanari (or as it might be more properly written, Adonari,since the second a is pronounced almost like the English o) is represented assurrounded by the same figures. It fits exactly Ezekiel's \"wheel of the Adonai,\"known as \"the Cherub of Jeheskiel,\" and indicates, beyond question, the sourcefrom which the Hebrew seer drew his allegories. For convenience of comparison wehave placed the figure in the pentacle. (See page 453.) Above these beasts were the angels or spirits, divided in two groups: the Igili,or celestial beings, and the Am-anaki, or terrestrial spirits, the giants,children of Anak, of whom the spies complained to Moses. The Kabbala Denudata gives to the kabalists a very clear, to the profane a verymuddled account of permutations or substitutions of one person for another. So,for instance, it says, that \"the scintilla\" (spiritual spark or soul) of Abrahamwas taken from Michael, the chief [images/00089.jpg] of the Æons, and highest emanation of the Deity; so high indeed that in the eyesof the Gnostics, Michael was identical with Christ. And yet Michael and Enochare one and the same person. Both occupy the junction-point of the cross of theZodiac as \"man.\" The scintilla of Isaac was that of Gabriel, the chief of theangelic host, and the scintilla of Jacob was taken from Uriel, named \"the fireof God\"; the sharpest sighted spirit in all Heaven. Adam is not the Kadmon butAdam Primus, the Microprosopus. In one of his aspects the latter is Enoch, theterrestrial patriarch and father of Methuselah. He that \"walked with God\" and\"did not die\" is the spiritual Enoch, who typified humanity, eternal in spiritand as eternal in flesh, though the latter does die. Death is but a new birth,and spirit is immortal; thus humanity can never die, for the Destroyer hasbecome the Creator, Enoch is the type of the dual man, spiritual andterrestrial. Hence his place in the centre of the astronomical cross. [images/00090.jpg] But was this idea original with the Hebrews? We think not. Every nation whichhad an astronomical system, and especially India, held the cross in the highestreverence, for it was the geometrical basis of the religious symbolism of theiravatars; the manifestation of the Deity, or of the Creator in his creature MAN;of God in humanity and humanity in God, as spirits. The oldest monuments ofChaldea, Persia, and India disclose the double or eight-pointed cross. Thissymbol, which very naturally is found, like every other geometrical figure innature, in plants as well as in the snowflakes, has led Dr. Lundy, in hissuper-Christian mysticism, to name such cruciform flowers as form aneight-pointed star by the junction of the two crosses--\"the Prophetic Star ofthe Incarnation, which joined heaven and earth, God and man together.\" * Thelatter sentence is perfectly expressed; only, the old kabalist axiom, \"as above,so below,\" answers still better, as it discloses to us the same God for allhumanity, not alone for the handful of Christians. It is the Mundane cross ofHeaven repeated on earth by plants and dual man: the physical man supersedingthe \"spiritual,\" at the junction-point of which stands the mythicalLibra-Hermes-Enoch. The gesture of one hand pointing to Heaven, is balanced bythe other pointing down to the earth; boundless generations below, boundlessregenerations above; the visible but the manifestation of the invisible; the manof dust abandoned to dust, the man of spirit reborn in spirit; thus it is finitehumanity which is the Son of the Infinite God. Abba--the Father; Amoria--theMother; the Son, the Universe. This primitive triad is repeated in all thetbeogonies. Adam Kadmon, Hermes, Enoch, Osiris, Christna, Ormazd, or Christosare all one. They stand as Metatrons between body and soul--eternal spiritswhich redeem flesh by the regeneration of flesh below, and soul by theregeneration above, where humanity walks once more with God. We have shown elsewhere that the symbol of the cross or Egyptian Tau,[images/00011.jpg], was by many ages earlier than the period assigned toAbraham, the alleled forefather of the Israelites, for otherwise Moses could nothave learned it of the priests. And that the Tau was held as sacred by the Jewsas by other \"Pagan\" nations is proved by a fact admitted now by Christiandivines as well as by infidel archeologists. Moses, in Exodus xii. 22, ordershis people to mark their door-posts and lintels with blood, lest the \"Lord God\"should make a mistake and smite some of his chosen people, instead of the doomedEgyptians. ** And this mark is a tau! The identical Egyptian handled cross, withthe half of which talisman Horus raised the dead, as is shown on a sculpturedruin at Philae. *** How gratuitous is the idea that all such crosses and symbolswere so many unconscious prophecies of Christ, is fully exemplified in the caseof the Jews upon whose accusation Jesus was put to death. For instance, the samelearned author remarks in Monumental Christianity that \"the Jews themselvesacknowledged this sign of salvation until they rejected Christ\"; and in anotherplace he asserts that the rod of Moses, used in his miracles before Pharaoh,\"was, no doubt, this crux ansata, or something like it, also used by theEgyptian priests.\" * Thus the logical inference would be, that 1, if the Jewsworshipped the same symbols as the Pagans, then they were no better than they;and 2, if, being so well versed as they were in the hidden symbolism of thecross, in the face of their having waited for centuries for the Messiah, theyyet rejected both the Christian Messiah and Christian Cross, then there musthave been something wrong about both. Those who \"rejected\" Jesus as the \"Son of God,\" were neither the people ignorantof religious symbols, nor the handful of atheistical Sadducees who put him todeath; but the very men who were instructed in the secret wisdom, who knew theorigin as well as the meaning of the cruciform symbol, and who put aside boththe Christian emblem and the Saviour suspended from it, because they could notbe parties to such a blasphemous imposition upon the common people. Nearly all the prophecies about Christ are credited to the patriarchs andprophets. If a few of the latter may have existed as real personages, every oneof the former is a myth. We will endeavor to prove it by the hiddeninterpretation of the Zodiac, and the relations of its signs to theseantediluvian men. If the reader will keep in mind the Hindu ideas of cosmogony, as given inchapter vi., he will better understand the relation between the biblicalantediluvian patriarchs, and that puzzle of commentators--\"Ezekiel's wheel.\"Thus, be it remembered 1, that the universe is not a spontaneous creation, butan evolution from pre-existent matter; 2, that it is only one of an endlessseries of universes; 3, that eternity is pointed off into grand cycles, in eachof which twelve transformations of our world occur, following its partialdestruction by fire and water, alternately. So that when a new minor period setsin, the earth is so changed, even geologically, as to be practically a newworld; 4, that of these twelve transformations, the earth after each of thefirst six is grosser, and everything on it--man included--more material, thanafter the preceding one: while after each of the remaining six the contrary istrue, both earth and man growing more and more refined and spiritual with eachterrestrial change; 5, that when the apex of the cycle is reached, a gradualdissolution takes place, and every living and objective form is destroyed. Butwhen that point is reached, humanity has become fitted to live subjectively aswell as objectively. And not humanity alone, but also animals, plants, and everyatom. After a time of rest, say the Buddhists, when a new world becomesself-formed, the astral souls of animals, and of all beings, except such as havereached the highest Nirvana; will return on earth again to end their cycles oftransformations, and become men in their turn. This stupendous conception, the ancients synthesized for the instruction of thecommon people, into a single pictorial design--the Zodiac, or celestial belt.Instead of the twelve signs now used, there were originally but ten known to thegeneral public, viz.: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo-Scorpio,Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_873] These were exoteric. Butin addition there were two mystical signs inserted, which none but initiatescomprehended, viz.: at the middle or junction-point where now stands Libra, andat the sign now called Scorpio, which follows Virgo. When it was found necessaryto make them exoteric, these two secret signs were added under their presentappellations as blinds to conceal the true names which gave the key to the wholesecret of creation, and divulged the origin of \"good and evil.\" The true Sabean astrological doctrine secretly taught that within this doublesign was hidden the explanation of the gradual transformation of the world, fromits spiritual and subjective, into the \"two-sexed\" sublunary state. The twelvesigns were therefore divided into two groups. The first six were called theascending, or the line of Macrocosm (the great spiritual world); the last six,the descending line, or the Microcosm (the little secondary world)--the merereflection of the former, so to say. This division was called Ezekiel's wheel,and was completed in the following way: First came the ascending five signs(euphemerized into patriarchs), Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, and thegroup concluded with Virgo-Scorpio. Then came the turning-point, Libra. Afterwhich, the first half of the sign Virgo-Scorpio, was duplicated and transferredto lead the lower, or descending group of Microcosm which ran down to Pisces, orNoah (deluge). To make it clearer, the sign Virgo-Scorpio, which appearedoriginally thus [images/00091.jpg], became simply Virgo, and the duplication,[images/00092.jpg], or Scorpio, was placed between Libra, the seventh sign(which is Enoch, or the angel Metatron, or Mediator between spirit and matter,or God and man). It now became Scorpio (or Cain), which sign or patriarch ledmankind to destruction, according LINES of GENERATIONS. Sethite. (Good Principle) 1. Adam.2. Seth.3. Enos.4. Cainan.5. Mahalaleel.6. Jared.7. Enoch.8. Methuselah.9 . Lamech.10. Noah. Kenite. (Evil Principle) 1. Adam.2. Cain.3. Enoch.4. Irad.5. Mehujael.6. Methusael.7. Lamech.8. Jubal.9. Jabal.10. Tubal Cain. The above are the ten biblical patriarchs, identical with Hindu Pragapatis(Pradjapatis), and the Sephiroth of the Kabala. We say ten patriarchs, nottwenty, for the Kenite line was devised for no other purpose than, 1, to carryout the idea of dualism, on which is founded the philosophy of every religion;for these two genealogical tables represent simply the opposing powers orprinciples of good and evil; and 2, as a blind for the uninitiated masses.Suppose we restore them to their primitive form, by erasing these premeditatedblinds. These are so transparent as to require but a small amount ofperspicacity to select, even though one should use only his unaided judgment,and were not, as we are, enabled to apply the test of the secret doctrine. By ridding ourselves, therefore, of the Kenite names that are mere duplicationsof the Sethite, or of each other, we get rid of Adam; of Enoch--who, in onegenealogy, is shown the father of Irad, and in the other, the son of Jared; ofLamech, son of Methusael, whereas he, Lamech, is son of Methuselah in theSethite line; of Irad (Jared), * Jubal and Jabal, who, with Tubal-Cain, form atrinity in one, and that one the double of Cain; of Mehujael (who is butMahalaleel differently spelled), and Methusael (Methuselah). This leaves us inthe Kenite genealogy of chapter iv., one only, Cain, who--the first murderer andfratricide-- De Rossi, of Parma, says of the Massoretes, in his \"Compendis,\" vol. iv., p. 7:\"It is known with what carefulness Esdras, the most excellent critic they havehad, had reformed [the text] and corrected it, and restored it to its primarysplendor. Of the many revisions undertaken after him, none are more celebratedthan that of the Massoretes, who came after the sixth century . . . and all themost zealous adorers and defenders of the \"Masorah,\" Christians and Jews . . .ingenuously accord and confess that it, such as it exists, is deficient,imperfect, interpolated, full of errors, and a most unsafe guide.\" The squareletter was not invented till after the third century. is made to stand in his line as father of Enoch, the most virtuous of men, whodoes not die, but is translated alive. Turn we now to the Sethite table, and wefind that Enos, or Enoch, comes second from Adam, and is father to Cain (an).This is no accident. There was an evident reason for this inversion ofpaternity; a palpable design--that of creating confusion and baffling inquiry. We say, then, that the patriarchs are simply the signs of the Zodiac, emblems,in their manifold aspects, of the spiritual and physical evolution of humanraces, of ages, and of divisions of time. In astrology, the first four of the\"Houses,\" in the diagrams of the \"Twelve Houses of Heaven\"--namely, the first,tenth, seventh, and fourth, or the second inner square placed with its anglesupward and downward, are termed angles, as being of the greatest strength andpower. They answer to Adam, Noah, Cain-an, and Enoch, Alpha, Omega, evil andgood, leading the whole. Furthermore, when divided (including the two secretnames) into four trigons or triads, viz.: fiery, airy, earthy, and watery, wefind the latter corresponding to Noah. Enoch and Lamech were doubled in the table of Cain, to fill out the requirednumber ten in both \"generations\" in the Bible, instead of employing the \"SecretName\"; and, in order that the patriarchs should correspond with the tenkabalistic Sephiroth, and fit at the same time the ten, and, subsequently,twelve signs of the Zodiac, in a manner comprehensible only to the kabalists. And now, Abel having disappeared out of that line of descent, he is replaced bySeth, who was clearly an afterthought suggested by the necessity of not havingthe human race descend entirely from a murderer. This dilemma being apparentlyfirst noticed when the Kenite table had been completed, Adam is made (after allthe generations had appeared) to beget this son, Seth. It is a suggestive factthat, whereas the double-sexed Adam of chapter v. is made in the likeness of theElohim (see Genesis chapter i. 27 and v. 1 of the same), Seth (v. 3) is begottenin Adam's \"own likeness,\" thus signifying that there were men of differentraces. Also, it is most noticeable that neither the age nor a single otherparticular respecting the patriarchs in the Kenite table is given, whereas thereverse is the case with those in the Sethite line. Most assuredly, no one could expect to find, in a work open to the public, thefinal mysteries of that which was preserved for countless ages as the grandestsecret of the sanctuary. But, without divulging the key to the profane, or beingtaxed with undue indiscretion, we may be allowed to lift a corner of the veilwhich shrouds the majestic doctrines of old. Let us then write down thepatriarchs as they ought to stand in their relation to the Zodiac, and see howthey correspond with the signs. The following diagram represents Ezekiel's Wheel, as given in many works, amongothers, in Hargrave Jennings' Rosicrucians: EZEKIEL'S WHEEL (exoteric). [images/00093.jpg] These signs are (follow numbers): 1, Aries; 2, Taurus; 3, Gemini; 4, Cancer; 5, Leo; 6, Virgo, or the ascendingline of the grand cycle of creation. After this comes 7, Libra--\"man,\" which,though it is found right in the middle, or the intersection point, leads downthe numbers:8, Scorpio; 9, Sagittarius; 10, Capricornus; 11, Aquarius; and 12, Pisces.While discussing the double sign of Virgo-Scorpio and Libra, Hargrave Jenningsobserves (p. 65): \"All this is incomprehensible, except in the strange mysticism of the Gnosticsand the kabalists; and the whole theory requires a key of explanation to renderit intelligible; which key is only darkly referred to as possible, but refusedabsolutely, by these extraordinary men, as not permissible to be disclosed.\" The said key must be turned seven times before the whole system is divulged. Wewill give it but one turn, and thereby allow the profane one glimpse into themystery. Happy he, who understands the whole! EZEKIEL'S WHEEL (esoteric). [images/00094.jpg] To explain the presence of Jodheva (or Yodheva), or what is generally termed thetetragram [images/00024.jpg], and of Adam and Eve, it will suffice to remind thereader of the following verses in Genesis, with their right meaning inserted inbrackets. 1. \"And God [Elohim] created man in his [their] own image . . . male and femalecreated he them [him]\"--(ch. 1. 27).2. \"Male and female created he them [him] . . . and called their [his] nameADAM\"--(v. 2).When the ternary is taken in the beginning of the tetragram, it expresses thedivine creation spiritually, i.e., without any carnal sin: taken at its oppositeend it expresses the latter; it is feminine. The name of Eve is composed ofthree letters, that of the primitive or heavenly Adam, is written with one letter, Jod or Yodh; therefore it must not be readJehova but Ieva, or Eve. The Adam of the first chapter is the spiritual,therefore pure androgyne, Adam Kadmon. When woman issues from the left rib ofthe second Adam (of dust), the pure Virgo is separated, and falling \"intogeneration,\" or the downward cycle, becomes Scorpio, * emblem of sin and matter.While the ascending cycle points at the purely spiritual races, or the tenprediluvian patriarchs (the Pradjapatis, and Sephiroth) ** are led on by thecreative Deity itself, who is Adam Kadmon or Yodcheva, the lower one is that ofthe terrestrial races, led on by Enoch or Libra, the seventh; who, because he ishalf-divine, half-terrestrial, is said to have been taken by God alive. Enoch,or Hermes, or Libra are one. All are the scales of universal harmony; justiceand equilibrium are placed at the central point of the Zodiac. The grand circleof the heavens, so well discoursed upon by Plato, in his Timaeus, symbolizes theunknown as a unity; and the smaller circles which form the cross, by theirdivision on the plane of the Zodiacal ring--typify, at the point of theirintersection, life. The centripetal and centrifugal forces, as symbols of Goodand Evil, Spirit and Matter, Life and Death, are also those of the Creator andthe Destroyer,--Adam and Eve, or God and the Devil, as they say in commonparlance. In the subjective, as well as in the objective worlds, they are thetwo powers, which through their eternal conflict keep the universe of spirit andmatter in harmony. They force the planets to pursue their paths, and keep themin their elliptical orbits, thus tracing the astronomical cross in theirrevolution through the Zodiac. In their conflict the centripetal force, were itto prevail, would drive the planets and living souls into the sun, type of theinvisible Spiritual Sun, the Paraatma or great universal Soul, their parent;while the centrifugal force would chase both planets and souls into the drearyspace, far from the luminary of the objective universe, away from the spiritualrealm of salvation and eternal life, and into the chaos of final cosmicdestruction, and individual annihilation. But the balance is there, eversensitive at the intersection point. It regulates the action of the twocombatants, and the combined effort of both, causes planets and \"living souls\"to pursue a double diagonal line in their revolution through Zodiac and Life;and thus preserving strict harmony, in visible and invisible heaven and earth,the forced unity of the two reconciles spirit and matter, and Enoch is said tostand a \"Metatron\" before God. Reckoning from him down to Noah and his threesons, each of these represent a new \"world,\" i.e., our earth, which is theseventh * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_881] after everyperiod of geological transformation, gives birth to another and distinct race ofmen and beings. Cain leads the ascending line, or Macrocosm, for he is the Son of the \"Lord,\"not of Adam (Genesis iv. 1). The \"Lord\" is Adam Kadmon, Cain, the Son of sinfulthought, not the progeny of flesh and blood, Seth on the other hand is theleader of the races of earth, for he is the Son of Adam, and begotten \"in hisown likeness, after his image\" (Genesis v. 3). Cain is Kenu, Assyrian, and meanseldest, while the Hebrew word [images/00095.jpg]means a Smith, an artificer. Our science shows that the globe has passed through five distinct geologicalphases, each characterized by a different stratum, and these are in reverseorder, beginning with the last: 1. The Quaternary period, in which man appearsas a certainty; 2. The Tertiary period, in which he may have appeared; 3.Secondary period, that of gigantic saurians, the megalosaurus, icthyosaurus, andplesiosaurus--no vestige of man; 4. The Palaeozoic period, that of giganticcrustacea; 5 (or first). The Azoic period, during which science asserts organiclife had not yet appeared. And is there no possibility that there was a period, and several periods, whenman existed, and yet was not an organic being--therefore could not have left anyvestige of himself for exact science? Spirit leaves no skeletons or fossilsbehind, and yet few are the men on earth who doubt that man can live bothobjectively and subjectively. At all events, the theology of the Brahmans, hoarywith antiquity, and which divides the formative periods of the earth into fourages, and places between each of these a lapse of 1,728,000 years, far moreagrees with official science and modern discovery than the absurd chronologicalnotions promulgated by the Councils of Nice and Trent. The names of the patriarchs were not Hebrew, though they may have been Hebraizedlater; they are evidently of Assyrian or Aryan origin. Thus Adam, for instance, stands in the explained Kabala as a convertible term,and applies nearly to every other patriarch, as every Sephiroth to each Sephira,and vice versa. Adam, Cain, and Abel form the first triad of the twelve. Theycorrespond in the Sephiral tree to the Crown, Wisdom, and Intelligence; and inastrology to the three trigons--the fiery, the earthy, and the airy; which fact,were we allowed to devote more space than we have to its elucidation, wouldperhaps show that astrology deserves the name of science as well as any other.Adam (Kadmon) or Aries (ram) is identical with the Egyptian ram-headed god Amun,fabricating man on the potter's wheel. His duplication, therefore--or the Adamof dust--is also Aries, Amon, when standing at the head of his generations, forhe fabricates mortals also in \"his own likeness.\" In astrology the planetJupiter is connected with the \"first house\" (Aries). The color of Jupiter, asseen in the \"stages of the seven spheres,\" on the tower of Borsippa, or BirsNimrud, was red; * and in Hebrew Adam means [images/00096.jpg]\"red\" as well as\"man.\" The Hindu god Agni, who presides at the sign of Pisces, next to that ofAries in their relation to the twelve months (February and March), ** is paintedof a deep red color, with two faces (male and female), three legs, and sevenarms; the whole forming the number twelve. So, also, Noah (Pisces), who appearsin the generations as the twelfth patriarch, counting Cain and Abel, is Adamagain under another name, for he is the forefather of a new race of mankind; andwith his \"three sons,\" one bad, one good, and one partaking of both qualities,is the terrestrial reflection of the super-terrestrial Adam and his three sons.Agni is represented mounted on a ram, with a tiara surmounted by a cross. *** Kain, presiding over the Taurus (Bull) of the Zodiac, is also very suggestive.Taurus belongs to the earthy trigon, and in connection with this sign it willnot be amiss to remind the student of an allegory from the Persian Avesta. Thestory goes that Ormazd produced a being--source and type of all the universalbeings--called LIFE, or Bull in the Zend. Ahriman (Cain) kills this being(Abel), from the seed of which (Seth) new beings are produced. Abel, inAssyrian, means son, but in Hebrew [images/00097.jpg]it means somethingephemeral, not long-lived, valueless, and also a \"Pagan idol,\" * as Kain means aHermaic statue (a pillar, the symbol of generation). Likewise, Abel is thefemale counterpart of Cain (male), for they are twins and probably androgynous;the latter answering to Wisdom, the former to Intelligence. So with all other patriarchs. Enos, [images/00098.jpg], is Homo again--a man, orthe same Adam, and Enoch in the bargain; and [images/00095.jpg]Kain-an isidentical with Cain. Seth, [images/00099.jpg], is Teth, or Thoth, or Hermes; andthis is the reason, no doubt, why Josephus, in his first book (ch. 3) shows Sethso proficient in astrology, geometry, and other occult sciences. Foreseeing theflood, he says, he engraved the fundamental principles of his art on two pillarsof brick and stone, the latter of which \"he saw himself [Josephus] to remain inSyria in his own time.\" Thus is it that Seth is identified also with Enoch, towhom kabalists and Masons attribute the same feat; and, at the same time, withHermes, or Kadmus again, for Enoch is identical with the former;[images/00100.jpg]He-NOCH means a teacher, an initiator, or an initiate; inGrecian mythology, Inachus. We have seen the part he is made to play in theZodiac. Mahalaleel, if we divide the word and write [images/00101.jpg], ma-ha-la, meanstender, merciful; and therefore is he made to correspond with the fourthSephira, Love or Mercy, emanated from the first triad. ** Irad,[images/00102.jpg], or Iared, is (minus the vowels) precisely the same. If fromthe verb [images/00103.jpg], it means descent; if from [images/00104.jpg], arad,it means offspring, and thus corresponds perfectly with the kabalisticemanations. Lamech, [images/00105.jpg], is not Hebrew, but Greek. Lam-ach means Lam--thefather, and Ou-Lom-Ach is the father of the age; or the father of him (Noah) whoinaugurates a new era or period of creation after the pralaya of the deluge;Noah being the symbol of a new world, the Kingdom (Malchuth) of the Sephiroth;hence his father, corresponding to the ninth Sephiroth, is the Foundation. ***Furthermore, both father and son answer to Aquarius and Pisces in the Zodiac;and thus the former belonging to the airy and the latter to the watery trigons,they close the list of the biblical myths. But if, as we see, every patriarch represents, in one sense, like each of thePradjapatis, a new race of antediluvian human beings; and if, as it may aseasily be proved, they are the copies of the Babylonian Saros, or ages, thelatter themselves copies of the Hindu ten dynasties of the \"Lords of beings,\" *yet, however we may regard them, they are among the profoundest allegories everconceived by philosophical minds. In the Nuctemeron, ** the evolution of the universe and its successive periodsof formation, together with the gradual development of the human races, areillustrated as fully as possible in the twelve \"hours\" into which the allegoryis divided. Each \"hour\" typifies the evolution of a new man, and in its turn isdivided into four quarters or ages. This work shows how thoroughly was theancient philosophy imbued with the doctrines of the early Aryans, who were thefirst to divide the life on our planet into four ages. If one would trace thisdoctrine from its source in the night of the traditional period down to the Seerof Patmos, he need not go astray among the religious systems of all nations. TheBabylonians he would find teaching that in four different periods four Oannes(or suns) appeared; the Hindus asserting their four Yuga; the Greeks, Romans,and others firmly believing in the golden, silver, brazen, and iron ages, eachof the epochs being heralded by the appearance of a saviour. The four Buddhas ofthe Hindus and the three prophets of the Zoroastrians--Oshedar-Cami,Oshedar-mah, and Sosiosh--preceded by Zarotushtra, are the types of these ages. In the Bible, the very opening tells us that before the sons of God saw thedaughters of men, the latter lived from 365 to 969 years. But when the \"LordGod\" saw the iniquities of mankind, He concluded to allow them at most 120 yearsof life (Genesis vi. 3). To account for such a violent oscillation in the humanmortality-table is only possible by tracing this decision of the \"Lord God\" toits origin. Such incongruities as we meet at every step in the Bible can be onlyattributed to the facts that the book of Genesis and the other books of Moseswere tampered with and remodelled by more than one author; and, that in theiroriginal state they were, with the exception of the external form of theallegories, faithful copies from the Hindu sacred books. In Manu, book i., wefind the following: \"In the first age, neither sickness nor suffering were known. Men lived fourcenturies.\" This was in the Krita or Satya yug. \"The Krita-yug is the type of justice. The bull which stands firm on its fourlegs is its image; man adheres to truth, and evil does not as yet direct hisactions.\" *But in each of the following ages primitive human life losesone-fourth of its duration, that is to say, in Treta-yug man lives 300, inDwapara-yug 200, and in Kali-yug, or our own age, but 100 years generally, atthe most. Noah, son of Lamech--Oulom-Ach, or father of the age--is the distortedcopy of Manu, son of Swayambhu, and the six Manus or Rishis issued from theHindu \"first man\" are the originals of Terah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, andMoses, the Hebrew sages, who beginning with Terah were all alleged to have beenastrologers, alchemists, inspired prophets, and soothsayers; or in a moreprofane but plainer language--magicians. If we consult the Talmudistic Mishna we find therein the first emanated divinecouple, the androgyne Demiurge Chochmah (or Hachma Achamoth) and Binah buildingthemselves a house with seven pillars. They are the architects of God--Wisdomand Intelligence--and His \"compass and square.\" The seven columns are the futureseven worlds, or the typical seven primordial \"days\" of creation. \"Chochmah immolates her victims.\" These victims are the numberless forces ofnature which must \"die\" (expend themselves) in order that they should live; whenone force dies out, it is but to give birth to another force, its progeny. Itdies but lives in its children, and resuscitates at every seventh generation.The servants of Chochmah, or wisdom, are the souls of H-Adam, for in him are allthe souls of Israel. There are twelve hours in the day, says the Mishna, and it is during these hoursthat is accomplished the creation of man. Would this be comprehensible, unlesswe had Manu to teach us that this \"day\" embraces the four ages of the world andhas a duration of twelve thousand divine years of the Devas? \"The Creators (Elohim) outline in the second\" hour \"the shape of a morecorporeal form of man. They separate it into two and prepare the sexes to becomedistinct from each other. Such is the way the Elohim proceeded in reference toevery created thing.\" ** \"Every fish, fowl, plant, beast and man was androgyneat the first hour.\" Says the commentator, the great Rabbi Simeon: \"O, companions, companions, man as emanation was both man and woman; as well onthe side of the FATHER as on the side of the MOTHER. And this is the sense ofthe words, and Elohim spoke, Let there be Light and it was Light! . . . And thisis the 'two-fold man'!\" * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu108.htm#fn_892] A spiritual woman was necessary as a contrast for the spiritual man. Harmony isthe universal law. In Taylor's translation, Plato's discourse upon creation isrendered so as to make him say of this universe that \"He caused it to move withcircular motion. . . . When, therefore, that God who is a perpetually reasoningDivinity, cogitated about that God (man) who was destined to subsist at somecertain period of time, He produced his body smooth and even, and every way evenand whole from the centre, and made it perfect. This perfect circle of thecreated God, He decussated in the form of the letter X.\" The italics of both these sentences from Timaeus belong to Dr. Lundy, the authorof that remarkable work mentioned once before, Monumental Christianity; andattention is drawn to the words of the Greek philosopher, with the evidentpurpose of giving them the prophetic character which Justin Martyr applied tothe same, when accusing Plato of having borrowed his \"physiological discussionin the Timaeus . . . concerning the Son of God placed crosswise in theuniverse,\" from Moses and his serpent of brass. The learned author seems tofully accord an unpremeditated prophecy to these words; although he does nottell us whether he believes that like Plato's created god, Jesus was originallya sphere \"smooth and even, and every way even and whole from the centre.\" Evenif Justin Martyr were excusable for his perversion of Plato, Dr. Lundy ought toknow that the day for that sort of casuistry is long gone by. What thephilosopher meant was man, who before being encased in matter had no use forlimbs, but was a pure spiritual entity. Hence if the Deity, and his universe,and the stellar bodies are to be conceived as spheroidal, this shape would bearchetypal man's. As his enveloping shell grew heavier, there came the necessityfor limbs, and the limbs sprouted. If we fancy a man with arms and legsnaturally extended at the same angle, by backing him against the circle thatsymbolizes his prior shape as a spirit, we would have the very figure describedby Plato--the X cross within the circle. All the legends of the creation, the fall of man, and the resultant deluge,belong to universal history, and are no more the property of the Israelites thanthat of any other nation. What specially belongs to them (kabalists excepted)are the disfigured details of every tradition. The Genesis of Enoch is by faranterior to the books of Moses, ** and Guillaume Postel has presented it to theworld, explaining the allegories as far as he dared; but the ground-work isstill unexposed. For the Jews, the Book of Enoch is as canonical as the Mosaicbooks; and if the Christians accepted the latter as an authority, we do not seewhy they should reject the former as an apocrypha. No more can the age of onethan that of the other be determined with anything like certainty. At the timeof the separation, the Samaritans recognized only the books of Moses and that ofJoshua, says Dr. Jost. * In 168 B.C., Jerusalem had its temple plundered, andall the sacred books were destroyed; ** therefore, the few MSS. that remainedwere to be found only among the \"teachers of tradition.\" The kabalistic Tanaim,and their initiates and prophets had always practised its teachings in commonwith the Canaanites, the Hamites, Midianites, Chaldeans, and all other nations.The story of Daniel is a proof of it. There was a sort of Brotherhood, or Freemasonry among the kabalists scatteredall over the world, since the memory of man; and, like some societies of themediaeval Masonry of Europe, they called themselves Companions *** andInnocents. **** It is a belief (founded on knowledge) among the kabalists, thatno more than the Hermetic rolls are the genuine sacred books of the seventy-twoelders--books which contained the \"Ancient Word\"--lost, but that they have allbeen preserved from the remotest times among secret communities. EmanuelSwedenborg says as much, and his words are based, he says, on the information hehad from certain spirits, who assured him that \"they performed their worshipaccording to this Ancient Word.\" \"Seek for it in China,\" adds the great seer,\"peradventure you may find it in Great Tartary!\" Other students of occultsciences have had more than the word of \"certain spirits\" to rely upon in thisspecial case--they have seen the books. We must choose therefore perforce between two methods--either to accept theBible exoterically or esoterically. Against the former we have the followingfacts: That, after the first copy of the Book of God has been edited andlaunched on the world by Hilkiah, this copy disappears, and Ezra has to make anew Bible, which Judas Maccabeus finishes; that when it was copied from thehorned letters into square letters, it was corrupted beyond recognition; thatthe Masorah completed the work of destruction; that, finally, we have a text,not 900 years old, abounding with omissions, interpolations, and premeditatedperversions; and that, consequently, as this Masoretic Hebrew text hasfossilized its mistakes, and the key to the \"Word of God\" is lost, no one has aright to enforce upon so-called \"Christians\" the divagations of a series ofhallucinated and, perhaps, spurious prophets, under the unwarranted anduntenable assumption that the author of it was the \"Holy Ghost\" in propriapersonae. Hence, we reject this pretended monotheistic Scripture, made up just when thepriests of Jerusalem found their political profit in violently breaking off allconnection with the Gentiles. It is at this moment only that we find thempersecuting kabalists, and banning the \"old wisdom\" of both Pagans and Jews. Thereal Hebrew Bible was a secret volume, unknown to the masses, and even theSamaritan Pentateuch is far more ancient than the Septuagint. As for the former,the Fathers of the Church never even heard of it. We prefer decidedly to takethe word of Swedenborg that the \"Ancient Word\" is somewhere in China or theGreat Tartary. The more so, as the Swedish seer is declared, at least by oneclergyman, namely, the Reverend Dr. R. L. Tafel, of London, to have been in astate of \"inspiration from God,\" while writing his theological works. He isgiven even the superiority over the penmen of the Bible, for, while the latterhad the words spoken to them in their ears, Swedenborg was made to understandthem rationally and was, therefore, internally and not externally illuminated.\"When,\" says the reverend author, \"a conscientious member of the New Churchhears any charges made against the divinity and the infallibility of either thesoul or the body of the doctrines of the New Jerusalem, he must at once placehimself on the unequivocal declaration made in those doctrines, that the Lordhas effected His second coming in and by means of those writings which werepublished by Emanuel Swedenborg, as His servant, and that, therefore, thosecharges are not and cannot be true.\" And if it is \"the Lord\" that spoke throughSwedenborg, then there is a hope for us that at least one divine willcorroborate our assertions, that the ancient \"word of God\" is nowhere but in theheathen countries, especially Buddhistic Tartary, Thibet, and China! \"The primitive history of Greece is the primitive history of India,\" exclaimsPococke in his India in Greece. In view of subsequent fruits of criticalresearch, we may paraphrase the sentence and say: \"The primitive history ofJudea is a distortion of Indian fable engrafted on that of Egypt.\" Manyscientists, encountering stubborn facts, and being reluctant to contrast thenarratives of the \"divine\" revelation with those of the Brahmanical books,merely present them to the reading public. Meanwhile they limit theirconclusions to criticisms and contradictions of each other. So Max Mulleropposes the theories of Spiegel, and some one else; and Professor Whitney thoseof the Oxford Orientalist; and Dr. Haug made onslaughts on Spiegel, while Dr.Spiegel chose some other victim; and now even the time-honored Akkadians andTuranians have had their day of glory. The Proto-Kasdeans, Kasdeo-Scyths,Sumirians, and what not, have to make room for some other fictions. Alas! forthe Akkads, Halevy, the Assyriologist attacks the Akkado-Sumirian language ofold Babylon, and Chabas, the Egyptologist, not content with dethroning theTuranian speech, which has rendered such eminent services to Orientalists whenperplexed, calls the venerable parent of the Akkadians--FrancoisLenormant--himself, a charlatan. Profiting by the learned turmoil, the Christianclergy take heart for their fantastic theology on the ground that when the jurydisagree there is a gain of time at least for the indicted party. And thus isoverlooked the vital question whether Christendom would not be the better foradopting Christism in place of Christianity, with its Bible, its vicariousatonement and its Devil. But to so important a personage as the latter, we couldnot do less than devote a special chapter. [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES407:* The Rishi are identical with Manu. The ten Pragapati, sons of Viradj,called Maritchi, Atri, Angira, Polastya, Poulaha, Kratu, Pratcheta, Vasishta,Brighu, and Narada, are euhemerized Powers, the Hindu Sephiroth. These emanatethe seven Rishi, or Manus, the chief of whom issued himself from the\"uncreated.\" He is the Adam of earth, and signifies man. His \"sons,\" thefollowing six Manus, represent each a new race of men, and in the total they arehumanity passing gradually through the primitive seven stages of evolution. 407:** In days of old, when the Brahmans studied more than they do now thehidden sense of their philosophy, they explained that each of these six distinctraces which preceded ours had disappeared. But now they pretend that a specimenwas preserved which was not destroyed with the rest, but reached the presentseventh stage. Thus they, the Brahmans are the specimens of the heavenly Manu,and issued from the mouth of Brahma; while the Sudra was created from his foot. 411:* To avoid discussion we adopt the palaeographical conclusions arrived at byMartin Haug and some other cautious scholars.

It is curious that Professor Max Muller, such a profound scholarin Comparative Mythology, should be found saying of the pragapatis and Hindugods that they are masks without actors; and of Abraham and other mythicalpatriarchs that they were real living men; of Abraham especially, we are told(see \"Semitic Monotheism\") that he \"stands before us as a figure second only toone in the whole history of the world.\" 414:* The italics are our own. \"The Vedas,\" lecture by Max Muller, p. 75. 414:** \"Chips,\" vol. i., p. 8. 415:* We believe that we have elsewhere given the contrary opinion, on thesubject of \"Atharva-Veda,\" of Prof. Whitney, of Yale College. 415:** See Baron Bunsen's \"Egypt,\" vol. v. 416:*”Chips,\" vol. i.; \"The Vedas.\" 416:** Max Muller: Lecture on \"The Vedas.\" 417:* Julian: \"In Matrem,\" p. 173; Julian: \"Oratio,\" v., 172. 417:** Lyd.: \"De Mensibus,\" iv., 38-74; \"Movers,\" p. 550; Dunlap: \"Saba,\" p. 3. 418:* \"Westminster Review\": Septenary Institutions; \"Stone Him to Death.\" 419:*\"Di Verbo Mirifico.\" 421:* Idra Suta: \"Sohar,\" book iii., p. 292 b.

Hilkiah and Josiah had to commune withHuldah, the prophetess, hence resort to magic to understand the word of the\"Lord God of Israel,\" most conveniently found by Hilkiah (2 Kings, xxiii.); andthat it has passed still later through more than one revision and remodelling isbut too well proved by its frequent incongruities, repetitions, andcontradictions. 422:* This assimilation of the deluge to an earthquake on the Assyrian tabletswould go to prove that the antediluvian nations were well acquainted with othergeological cataclysms besides the deluge, which is represented in the Bible asthe first calamity which befel humanity, and a punishment. 423:* George Smith notes in the tablets, first the creation of the moon, andthen of the sun: \"Its beauty and perfection are extolled, and the regularity ofits orbit, which led to its being considered the type of a judge and theregulator of the world.\" Did this story of the deluge relate simply to acosmogonical cataclysm--even were it universal--why should the goddess Ishtaraor Astoreth (the moon) speak of the creation of the sun after the deluge? Thewaters might have reached as high as the mountain of Nizir (Chaldean version),or Jebel-Djudi (the deluge-mountains of the Arabian legends), or yet Ararat (ofthe biblical narrative), and even Himalaya of the Hindu tradition, and yet notreach the sun--even the Bible itself stopped short of such a miracle. It isevident that the deluge of the people who first recorded it had another meaning,less problematical and far more philosophical than that of a universal deluge,of which there are no geological traces whatever. 425:* he \"dead letter that killeth,\" is magnificently illustrated in the case ofthe Jesuit de Carriere, quoted in the \"Bible dans l'Inde.\" The followingdissertation represents the spirit of the whole Catholic world: \"So that thecreation of the world,\" writes this faithful son of Loyola, explaining thebiblical chronology of Moses, \"and all that is recorded in Genesis, might havebecome known to Moses through recitals personally made to him by his fathers.Perhaps, even, the memories yet existed among the Israelites, and from thoserecollections he may have recorded the dates of births and deaths of thepatriarchs, the numbering of their children, and the names of the differentcountries in which each became established under the guidance of the holyspirit, which we must always regard as the chief author of the sacred books\"!!! 426:*See chapter xv. and last of Part I. 427:* \"Description, etc., of the People of India,\" by the Abbe J.

Moreover, all the ancientauthorities corroborate our assertion still more. Philostratus makes the BrahminIarchus say (V.A., iii., 6) that the Æthiopians were originally an Indian race,compelled to emigrate from the mother-land for sacrilege and regicide (seePococke's \"India,\" etc., ii., p. 206). An Egyptian is made to remark, that hehad heard from his father, that the Indians were the wisest of men, and that theÆthiopians, a colony of the Indians, preserved the wisdom and usages of theirfathers, and acknowledged their ancient origin. Julius Africanus (in Eusebiusand Syncellus), makes the same statement. And Eusebius writes: \"The Æthiopians,emigrating from the river Indus, settled in the vicinity of Egypt\" (Lemp.,Barker's edition, \"Meroe\"). 439:* They might have been also, as Pococke thinks, simply the tribes of the\"Oxus,\" a name derived from the \"Ookshas,\" those people whose wealth lay in the\"Ox,\" for he shows Ookshan to be a crude form of Ooksha, an ox (in Sanscrit oxis as in English). He believes that it was they, \"the lords of the Oxus,\" whogave their name to the sea around which they ruled in many a country, the Euxineor Ooksh-ine. Pali means a shepherd, and s'than is a land. \"The warlike tribesof the Oxus penetrated into Egypt, then swept onward to Palestine (PALI-STAN),the land of the Palis or shepherds, and there effected more permanentsettlements\" (\"India in Greece\"). Yet, if even so, it would only the moreconfirm our opinion that the Jews are a hybrid race, for the \"Bible\" shows themfreely intermarrying, not alone with the Canaanites, but with every other nationor race they come in contact with. 441:* Prof. A. Wilder: \"Notes.\" 442:*Moses reigned over the people of Israel in the wilderness for over fortyyears. 442:** The name of the wife of Moses was Zipporah (Exodus ii.). 443:* About 1040, the Jewish doctors removed their schools from Babylonia toSpain, and of the four great rabbis that flourished during the next fourcenturies, their works all show different readings, and abound with mistakes inthe manuscripts. The \"Masorah\" made things still worse. Many things that thenexisted in the manuscripts are there no longer, and their works teem withinterpolations as well as with lacunae. The oldest Hebrew manuscript belongs tothis period. Such is the divine revelation we are to credit. 443:** No chronology was accepted by the rabbis as authoritative till thetwelfth century. The 40 and 1,000 are not exact numbers, but have been crammedin to answer monotheism and the exigencies of a religion calculated to appeardifferent from that of the Pagans. (\"Chron. Orth.,\" p. 238). One finds in the\"Pentateuch\" only events occurring about two years before the fabled \"Exodus\"and the last year. The rest of the chronology is nowhere, and can be followedonly through kabalistic computations, with a key to them in the hand. 444:* The Gnostics, called Collyridians, had transferred from Astoreth theirworship to Mary, also Queen of Heaven. They were persecuted and put to death bythe orthodox Christians as heretics. But if these Gnostics had established herworship by offering her sacrifices of cakes, cracknels, or fine wafers, it wasbecause they imagined her to have been born of an immaculate virgin, as Christis alleged to have been born of his mother. And now, the Pope's infallibilityhaving been recognized and accepted, its first practical manifestation is therevival of the Collyridian belief as an article of faith (See \"Apocryphal NewTestament\"; Hone: \"The Gospel of Mary attributed to Matthew\"). 444:** Hargrave Jennings: \"Rosicrucians.\" 445:*\"Progress of Religious Ideas.\" 445:**Lilith was Adam's first wife \"before he married Eve,\" of whom \"he begatnothing but devils\"; which strikes us as a very novel, if pious, way ofexplaining a very philosophical allegory. 446:* It is in commemoration of the Ark of the Deluge that the Phoenicians,those bold explorers of the \"deep,\" carried, fixed on the prow of their ships,the image of the goddess Astarte, who is Elissa, Venus Erycina of Sicily, andDido, whose name is the feminine of David. 447:* Dr. Lundy: \"Monumental Christianity.\" 447:** Lucian, iv. 276. 447:*** 1 Kings xviii.

There was a time, and that less than two centuriesago, when they themselves exhibited the most fervent desire to relapse into sunand star worship. This pious and curious attempt was denounced but a few monthssince by Camille Flammarion, the French astronomer. He shows two AugsburgianJesuits, Schiller and Bayer, who felt quite anxious to change the names of thewhole Sabean host of the starry heaven, and worship them again under Christiannames! Having anathematized the idolatrous sun-worshippers for over fifteencenturies, the Church now seriously proposed to continue heliolatry--to theletter this time--as their idea was to substitute for Pagan myths biblical and(in their ideas) real personages. They would have called the sun, Christ; themoon, Virgin Mary; Saturn, Adam; Jupiter, Moses (!); Mars, Joshua; Venus, Johnthe Baptist; and Mercury, Elias. And very proper substitutes too, showing thegreat familiarity of the Catholic Church with ancient Pagan and kabalisticlearning, and its readiness, perhaps, to at last confess the source whence cametheir own myths. For is not king Messiah the sun, the Demiurge of theheliolaters, under various names? Is he not the Egyptian Osiris and the GrecianApollo? And what more appropriate name than Virgin Mary for the PaganDiana-Astarte, \"the Queen of Heaven,\" against which Jeremiah exhausted a wholevocabulary of imprecations? Such an adoption would have been historically aswell as religiously correct. Two large plates were prepared, says Flammarion, ina recent number of \"La Nature,\" and represented the heavens with Christianconstellations instead of Pagan. Apostles, popes, saints, martyrs, andpersonages of the Old and New Testament completed this Christian Sabeanism. \"Thedisciples of Loyola used every exertion to make this plan succeed.\" It iscurious to find in India among the Mussulmans the name of Terah, Abraham'sfather, Azar or Azarh, and Azur, which also means fire, and is, at the sametime, the name of the Hindu third solar month (from June to July), during whichthe sun is in Gemini, and the full moon near Sagittarius. 451:* Cicero: \"De Nat.

C., to which, if you add 1790 years since Christ, it appears that 16,984years have elapsed since the origin of the Zodiac. to exoteric theology; but, according to the true doctrine of thewisdom-religion, it indicated the degradation of the whole universe in itscourse of evolution downward from the subjective to the objective. The sign of Libra is credited as a later invention by the Greeks, but it is notgenerally stated that those among them who were initiated had only made a changeof names conveying the same idea as the secret name to those \"who knew,\" leavingthe masses as unwise as ever. Yet it was a beautiful idea of theirs, this Libra,or the balance, expressing as much as could possibly be done without unveilingthe whole and ultimate truth. They intended it to imply that when the course ofevolution had taken the worlds to the lowest point of grossness, where theearths and their products were coarsest, and their inhabitants most brutish, theturning-point had been reached--the forces were at an even balance. At thelowest point, the still lingering divine spark of spirit within began to conveythe upward impulse. The scales typified that eternal equilibrium which is thenecessity of a universe of harmony, of exact justice, of the balance ofcentripetal and centrifugal forces, darkness and light, spirit and matter. These additional signs of the Zodiac warrant us in saying that the Book ofGenesis as we now find it, must be of later date than the invention of Libra bythe Greeks; for we find the chapters of the genealogies remodelled to fit thenew Zodiac, instead of the latter being made to correspond with the list ofpatriarchs. And it is this addition and the necessity of concealing the truekey, that led the Rabbinical compilers to repeat the names of Enoch and Lamechtwice, as we see them now in the Kenite table. Alone, among all the books of theBible, Genesis belongs to an immense antiquity. The others are all lateradditions, the earliest of which appeared with Hilkiah, who evidently concoctedit with the help of Huldah, the prophetess. As there is more than one meaning attached to the stories of the creation anddeluge, we say, therefore, that the biblical account cannot be comprehendedapart from the Babylonian story of the same; while neither will be thoroughlyclear without the Brahmanical esoteric interpretation of the deluge, as found inthe Mahabharata and the Satapatha-Brahmana. It is the Babylonians who weretaught the \"mysteries,\" the sacerdotal language, and their religion by theproblematical Akkadians who--according to Rawlinson came from Armenia--not theformer who emigrated to India. Here the evidence becomes clear. The BabylonianXisuthrus is shown by Movers to have represented the \"sun\" in the Zodiac, in thesign of Aquarius, and Oannes, the man-fish, the semi-demon, is Vishnu in hisfirst avatar; thus giving the key to the double source of the biblicalrevelation. Oannes is the emblem of priestly, esoteric wisdom; he comes out from the sea,because the \"great deep,\" the water, typifies, as we have shown, the secretdoctrine. For this same reason Egyptians deified the Nile, apart from its beingregarded, in consequence of its periodical overflows, as the \"Saviour\" of thecountry. They even held the crocodiles as sacred, from having their abode in the\"deep.\" The \"Hamites,\" so called, have always preferred to settle near riversand oceans. Water was the first-created element, according to some oldcosmogonies. This name of Oannes is held in the greatest reverence, in theChaldean records. The Chaldean priests wore a head-gear like a fish's head, anda shadbelly coat, representing the body of a fish. * \"Thales,\" says Cicero, \"assures that water is the principle of all things; andthat God is that Mind which shaped and created all things from water.\" ** \"In the Beginning, SPIRIT within strengthens Heaven and Earth,The watery fields, and the lucid globe of Luna, and then --Titan stars; and mind infused through the limbsAgitates the whole mass, and mixes itself with GREAT MATTER.\" **Thus water represents the duality of both the Macrocosmos and the Microcosmos,in conjunction with the vivifying SPIRIT, and the evolution of the little worldfrom the universal cosmos. The deluge then, in this sense, points to that finalstruggle between the conflicting elements, which brought the first great cycleof our planet to a close. These periods gradually merged into each other, orderbeing brought out of chaos, or disorder, and the successive types of organismbeing evolved only as the physical conditions of nature were prepared for theirappearance; for our present race could not have breathed on earth, during thatintermediate period, not having as yet the allegorical coats of skin. **** In chapters iv. and v. of Genesis, we find the so-called generations of Cain andSeth. Let us glance at them in the order in which they stand: 458:* See cuts in Inman's \"Ancient Faiths.\" 458:** Cicero: \"De Nat. Deorum,\" i., 10. 458:*** Virgil: \"Æneid,\" vi., 724 ff. 458:**** The term \"coats of skin,\" is the more suggestive when we learn that theHebrew word \"skin\" used in the original text, means human skin. The text says:\"And Java Aleim made for Adam and his wife [images/00106.jpg]CHITONUTT OUR. Thefirst Hebrew word is the same as the Greek χιτον--chiton--coat. Parkhurstdefines it as the skin of men or animals [images/00107.jpg], and[images/00108.jpg], OUR, OR, or ORA. The same word is used at Exodus xxxiv. 30,35, when the skin of Moses \"shone\" (A. Wilder). 459:* Here, again, the \"Masorah,\" by converting one name into another, hashelped to falsify the little that was left original in the primitive Scriptures. 463:* Scorpio is the astrological sign of the organs of reproduction. 463:** The patriarchs are all convertible in their numbers as well asinterchangeable. According to what they relate, they become ten, five, seven,twelve, and even fourteen. The whole system is so complicated that it is anutter impossibility in a work like this to do more than hint at certain matters. 464:* See vol. I. of the present work, p. 32. Alone, the Hindu calculation bythe Zodiac, can give a key to the Hebrew chronologies and the ages of thepatriarchs. If we bear in mind that, according to the former astronomical andchronological calculations, out of the fourteen manwantara (or divine ages),each of which composed of twelve thousand years of the devas, multiplied byseventy-one, forms one period of creation--not quite seven are yet passed, theHebrew calculation will become more clear. To help, as much as possible, thosewho will be sure to get a good deal bewildered in this calculation, we willremind the reader that the Zodiac is divided into 360 degrees, and every signinto thirty degrees; that in the Samaritan Bible the age of Enoch is fixed at360 years; that in \"Manu,\" the divisions of time are given thus: \"The day andthe night are composed of thirty Mouhourta. A mouhourta contains thirty kalas. Amonth of the mortals is of thirty days, but it is but one day of the pitris. . .. A year of the mortals is one day of the Devas.\" 465:* See Rawlinson's \"Diagrams.\" 465:** In the Brahmanical Zodiac the signs are all presided over by anddedicated to one of the twelve great gods. So, 1. Mecha (Aries) is dedicated toVaruna; 2. Vricha (Taurus), to Yama; 3. Mithuna (Gemini), to Pavana; 4.Karcataca (Cancer), to Surya; 5. Sinha (Leo), to Soma; 6. Kanya (Virgo), toKartikeia; 7. Toulha (Libra), to Kouvera; 8. Vristchica (Scorpio), to Kama; 9.Dhanous (Sagittarius), to Ganesa; 10. Makara (Capricornus), to Poulhar; 11.Kumbha (Aquarius), to Indra; and, 12. Minas (Pisces), to Agni. 465:*** Moor's \"Hindu Pantheon,\" pp. 295-302. 466:* Apollo was also Abelius, or Bel. 466:** Halal is a name of Apollo. The name of Mahalal-Eliel would then be theautumnal sun, of July, and this patriarch presides over Leo (July) the zodiacalsign. 466:*** See description of the Sephiroth, in chapter iv. 467:* How servile was this Chaldean copy may be seen in comparing the Hinduchronology with that of the Babylonians. According to Manu, the antediluviandynasties of the Pradjapatis reigned 4,320,000 human years, a whole divine ageof the devas in short, or that length of time which invariably occurs betweenlife on earth and the dissolution of that life, or pralaya. The Chaldeans, intheir turn, give precisely the same figures, minus one cipher, to wit: they maketheir 120 saros yield a total of 432,000 years. 467:** Eliphas Levi gives it both in the Greek and Hebrew versions, but socondensed and arbitrarily that it is impossible for one who knows less thanhimself to understand him. 468:* See Rabbi Simeon's dissertation on the primitive Man-Bull and the horns.\"Sohar.\" 468:** \"The Nuctameron of the Hebrews\"; see Eliphas Levi, vol. ii. 469:* \"Auszuge aus dem Sohar,\" p. 13, 15. 469:** Such is the opinion of the erudite Dr. Jost and Donaldson. \"The OldTestament. p. 470 Books, as we now find them, seem to have been concluded about150 years B.C. . . .

Amen.\"Does this offend? Does it seem extravagant, cruel, blasphemous? Listen. In thecity of New York, on the ninth day of April, 1877--that is to say, in the lastquarter of what is proudly styled the century of discovery and the age ofillumination--the following scandalous ideas were broached. We quote from thereport in the Sun of the following morning: \"The Baptist preachers met yesterday in the Mariners' Chapel, in Oliver Street.Several foreign missionaries were present. The Rev. John W. Sarles, of Brooklyn,read an essay, in which he maintained the proposition that all adult heathen,dying without the knowledge of the Gospel, are damned eternally. Otherwise, thereverend essayist argued, the Gospel is a curse instead of a blessing, the menwho crucified Christ served him right, and the whole structure of revealedreligion tumbles to the ground. \"Brother Stoddard, a missionary from India, indorsed the views of the Brooklynpastor. The Hindus were great sinners. One day, after he had preached in themarket place, a Brahman got up and said: 'We Hindus beat the world in lying, butthis man beats us. How can he say that God loves us? Look at the poisonousserpents, tigers, lions, and all kinds of dangerous animals around us. If Godloves us, why doesn't He take them away?' \"The Rev. Mr. Pixley, of Hamilton, N. Y., heartily subscribed to the doctrine ofBrother Sarles's essay, and asked for $5,000 to fit out young men for theministry.\" And these men--we will not say teach the doctrine of Jesus, for that would be toinsult his memory, but--are paid to teach his doctrine! Can we wonder thatintelligent persons prefer annihilation to a faith encumbered by such amonstrous doctrine? We doubt whether any respectable Brahman would haveconfessed to the vice of lying--an art cultivated only in those portions ofBritish India where the most Christians are found. * But we challenge any honest man in the wide world to say whether he thinks theBrahman was far from the truth in saying of the missionary Stoddard, \"this manbeats us all\" in lying. What else would he say, if the latter preached to themthe doctrine of eternal damnation, because, indeed, they had passed their liveswithout reading a Jewish book of which they never heard, or asked salvation of aChrist whose existence they never suspected! But Baptist clergymen who need afew thousand dollars must devise terrifying sensations to fire thecongregational heart. We abstain, as a rule, from giving our own experience when we can callacceptable witnesses, and so, upon reading missionary Stoddard's outrageousremarks, we requested our acquaintance, Mr. William L. D. O'Grady, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu109.htm#fn_900] to give a fair opinionupon the missionaries. This gentleman's father and grandfather were British armyofficers, and he himself was born in India, and enjoyed life-long opportunitiesto learn what the general opinion among the English is of these religiouspropagandists. Following is his communication in reply to our letter: \"You ask me for my opinion of the Christian missionaries in India. In all theyears I spent there, I never spoke to a single missionary. They were not insociety, and, from what I heard of their proceedings and could see for myself, Idon't wonder at it. Their influence on the natives is bad. Their converts areworthless, and, as a rule, of the lowest class; nor do they improve byconversion. No respectable family will employ Christian servants. They lie, theysteal, they are unclean--and dirt is certainly not a Hindu vice; they drink--andno decent native of any other belief ever touches intoxicating liquor; they areoutcasts from their own people and utterly despicable. Their new teachers setthem a poor example of consistency. While holding forth to the Pariah that Godmakes no distinction of persons, they boast intolerably over the stray Brahmans,who, very much \"off color,\" occasionally, at long intervals, fall into theclutches of these hypocrites.\"The missionaries get very small salaries, as publicly stated in the proceedingsof the societies that employ them, but, in some unaccountable way, manage tolive as well as officials with ten times their income. When they come home torecover their health, shattered, as they say, by their arduous labors--whichthey seem to be able to afford to do quite frequently, when supposed richerpeople cannot--they tell childish stories on platforms, exhibit idols asprocured with infinite difficulty, which is quite absurd, and give an account oftheir imaginary hardships which is perfectly harrowing but untrue from beginningto end. I lived some years in India myself, and nearly all my blood-relationshave passed or will pass the best years of their lives there. I know hundreds ofBritish officials, and I never heard from one of them a single word in favor ofthe missionaries. Natives of any position look on them with the supremestcontempt, although suffering chronic exasperation from their arrogantaggressiveness; and the British Government, which continues endowments toPagodas, granted by the East India Company, and which supports unsectarianeducation, gives them no countenance whatever. Protected from personal violence,they yelp and bark at natives and Europeans alike, after the fashion ofill-conditioned curs. Often recruited from the poorest specimens of theologicalfanaticism, they are regarded on all sides as mischievous. Their rabid,reckless, vulgar, and offensive propagandism caused the great Mutiny of 1857.They are noisome humbugs.\"WM. L. D. O'GRADY.\"NEW YORK, June 12, 1877.\"The new creed therefore, with which we opened this chapter, coarse as it maysound, embodies the very essence of the belief of the Church as inculcated byher missionaries. It is regarded as less impious, less infidel, to doubt thepersonal existence of the Holy Ghost, or the equal Godhead of Jesus, than toquestion the personality of the Devil. But a summary of Koheleth is well-nighforgotten. * Who ever quotes the golden words of the prophet Micah, ** or seemsto care for the exposition of the Law, as given by Jesus himself? ***The \"bull'seye\" in the target of Modern Christianity is in the simple phrase to \"fear theDevil.\" The Catholic clergy and some of the lay champions of the Roman Church fightstill more for the existence of Satan and his imps. If Des Mousseaux maintainsthe objective reality of spiritual phenomena with such an unrelenting ardor, itis because, in his opinion, the latter are the most direct evidence of the Devilat work. The Chevalier is more Catholic than the Pope; and his logic anddeductions from never-to-be and non-established premises are unique, and proveonce more that the creed offered by us is the one which expresses the Catholicbelief most eloquently. \"If magic and spiritualism,\" he says, \"were both but chimeras, we would have tobid an eternal farewell to all the rebellious angels, now troubling the world;for thus, we would have no more demons down here. . . . And if we lost ourdemons, we would LOSE OUR SAVIOUR likewise. For, from whom did that Saviour cometo save us? And then, there would be no more Redeemer; for from whom or whatcould that Redeemer redeem us? Hence, there would be no moreChristianity!!\" **** Oh, Holy Father of Evil; Sainted Satan! We pray thee do notabandon such pious Christians as the Chevalier des Mousseaux and some Baptistclergymen!! For our part, we would rather remember the wise words of J. C. Colquhoun, * whosays that \"those persons who, in modern times, adopt the doctrine of the Devilin its strictly literal and personal application, do not appear to be aware thatthey are in reality polytheists, heathens, idolaters.\" Seeking supremacy in everything over the ancient creeds, the Christians claimthe discovery of the Devil officially recognized by the Church. Jesus was thefirst to use the word \"legion\" when speaking of them; and it is on this groundthat M. des Mousseaux thus defends his position in one of his demonologicalworks. \"Later,\" he says, \"when the synagogue expired, depositing its inheritancein the hands of Christ, were born into the world and shone, the Fathers of theChurch, who have been accused by certain persons of a rare and preciousignorance, of having borrowed their ideas as to the spirits of darkness from thetheurgists.\" Three deliberate, palpable, and easily-refuted errors--not to use a harsherword--occur in these few lines. In the first place, the synagogue, far fromhaving expired, is flourishing at the present day in nearly every town ofEurope, America, and Asia; and of all churches in Christian cities, it is themost firmly established, as well as the best behaved. Further--while no one willdeny that many Christian Fathers were born into the world (always, of course,excepting the twelve fictitious Bishops of Rome, who were never born at all),every person who will take the trouble to read the works of the Platonists ofthe old Academy, who were theurgists before Iamblichus, will recognize thereinthe origin of Christian Demonology as well as the Angelology, the allegoricalmeaning of which was completely distorted by the Fathers. Then it could hardlybe admitted that the said Fathers ever shone, except, perhaps, in the refulgenceof their extreme ignorance. The Reverend Dr. Shuckford, who passed the betterpart of his life trying to reconcile their contradictions and absurdities, wasfinally driven to abandon the whole thing in despair. The ignorance of thechampions of Plato must indeed appear rare and precious by comparison with thefathomless profundity of Augustine, \"the giant of learning and erudition,\" whoscouted the sphericity of the earth, for, if true, it would prevent theantipodes from seeing the Lord Christ when he descended from heaven at thesecond advent; or, of Lactantius, who rejects with pious horror Pliny'sidentical theory, on the remarkable ground that it would make the trees at theother side of the earth grow and the men walk with their heads downward; or,again, of Cosmas-Indicopleustes, whose orthodox system of geography is embalmedin his \"Christian topography\"; or, finally, of Bede, who assured the world thatthe heaven \"is tempered with glacial waters, lest it should be set on fire\" *--abenign dispensation of Providence, most likely to prevent the radiance of theirlearning from setting the sky ablaze! Be this as it may, these resplendent Fathers certainly did borrow their notionsof the \"spirits of darkness\" from the Jewish kabalists and Pagan theurgists,with the difference, however, that they disfigured and outdid in absurdity allthat the wildest fancy of the Hindu, Greek, and Roman rabble had ever created.There is not a dev in the Persian Pandaimonion half so preposterous, as aconception, as des Mousseaux's Incubus revamped from Augustine. Typhon,symbolized as an ass, appears a philosopher in comparison with the devil caughtby the Normandy peasant in a key-hole; and it is certainly not Ahriman or theHindu Vritra who would run away in rage and dismay, when addressed as St. Satan,by a native Luther. The Devil is the patron genius of theological Christianity. So \"holy andreverend is his name\" in modern conception, that it may not, except occasionallyfrom the pulpit, be uttered in ears polite. In like manner, anciently, it wasnot lawful to speak the sacred names or repeat the jargon of the Mysteries,except in the sacred cloister. We hardly know the names of the Samothraciangods, but cannot tell precisely the number of the Kabeiri. The Egyptiansconsidered it blasphemous to utter the title of the gods of their secret rites.Even now, the Brahman only pronounces the syllable Om in silent thought, and theRabbi, the Ineffable Name, [images/00024.jpg]. Hence, we who exercise no suchveneration, have been led into the blunders of miscalling the names of HISIRISand YAVA by the mispronunciations, Osiris and Jehovah. A similar glamour bidsfair, it will be perceived, to gather round the designation of the darkpersonage of whom we are treating; and in the familiar handling, we shall bevery likely to shock the peculiar sensibilities of many who will consider a freementioning of the Devil's names as blasphemy--the sin of sins, that \"hath neverforgiveness.\" ** Several years ago an acquaintance of the author wrote a newspaper article todemonstrate that the diabolos or Satan of the New Testament denoted thepersonification of an abstract idea, and not a personal being. He was answeredby a clergyman, who concluded the reply with the deprecatory expression, \"I fearthat he has denied his Saviour.\" In his rejoinder he pleaded, \"Oh, no! we onlydenied the Devil.\" But the clergyman failed to perceive the difference. In hisconception of the matter, the denying of the personal objective existence of theDevil was itself \"the sin against the Holy Ghost.\" This necessary Evil, dignified by the epithet of \"Father of Lies,\" was,according to the clergy, the founder of all the world-religions of ancient time,and of the heresies, or rather heterodoxies, of later periods, as well as theDeus ex Machina of modern Spiritualism. In the exceptions which we take to thisnotion, we protest that we do not attack true religion or sincere piety. We areonly carrying on a controversy with human dogmas. Perhaps in doing this weresemble Don Quixote, because these things are only windmills. Nevertheless, letit be remembered that they have been the occasion and pretext for theslaughtering of more than fifty millions of human beings since the words wereproclaimed: \"LOVE YOUR ENEMIES.\" * It is a late day for us to expect the Christian clergy to undo and amend theirwork. They have too much at stake. If the Christian Church should abandon oreven modify the dogma of an anthropomorphic devil, it would be like pulling thebottom card from under a castle of cards. The structure would fall. Theclergymen to whom we have alluded perceived that upon the relinquishing of Satanas a personal devil, the dogma of Jesus Christ as the second deity in theirtrinity must go over in the same catastrophe. Incredible, or even horrifying, asit may seem, the Roman Church bases its doctrine of the godhood of Christentirely upon the satanism of the fallen archangel. We have the testimony ofFather Ventura, who proclaims the vital importance of this dogma to theCatholics. The Reverend Father Ventura, the illustrious ex-general of the Theatins,certifies that the Chevalier des Mousseaux, by his treatise, Moeurs et Pratiquesdes Demons, has deserved well of mankind, and still more of the most HolyCatholic and Apostolic Church. With this voucher, the noble Chevalier, it willbe perceived, \"speaks as one having authority.\" He asserts explicitly, that tothe Devil and his angels we are absolutely indebted for our Saviour; and thatbut for them we would have no Redeemer, no Christianity. Many zealous and earnest souls have revolted at the monstrous dogma of JohnCalvin, the popekin of Geneva, that sin is the necessary cause of the greatestgood. It was bolstered up, nevertheless, by logic like that of des Mousseaux,and illustrated by the same dogmas. The execution of Jesus, the god-man, on thecross, was the most prodigious crime in the universe, yet it was necessary thatmankind--those predestinated to ever-lasting life--might be saved. D'Aubigneecites the quotation by Martin Luther from the canon, and makes him exclaim, inecstatic rapture: \"O beata culpa, qui talem meruisti redemptorem!\" O blessedsin, which didst merit such a Redeemer. We now perceive that the dogma which hadappeared so monstrous is, after all, the doctrine of Pope, Calvin, and Lutheralike--that the three are one. Mahomet and his disciples, who held Jesus in great respect as a prophet, remarksEliphas Levi, used to utter, when speaking of Christians, the followingremarkable words: \"Jesus of Nazareth was verily a true prophet of Allah and agrand man; but lo! his disciples all went insane one day, and made a god ofhim.\" Max Muller kindly adds: \"It was a mistake of the early Fathers to treat theheathen gods as demons or evil spirits, and we must take care not to commit thesame error with regard to the Hindu gods.\" * But we have Satan presented to us as the prop and mainstay of sacerdotism--anAtlas, holding the Christian heaven and cosmos upon his shoulders. If he falls,then, in their conception, all is lost, and chaos must come again. This dogma of the Devil and redemption seems to be based upon two passages inthe New Testament: \"For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that hemight destroy the works of the Devil.\" ** \"And there was war in heaven; Michaeland his angels fought against the Dragon; and the Dragon fought, and his angels,and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And thegreat Dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, whichdeceiveth the whole world.\" Let us, then, explore the ancient Theogonies, inorder to ascertain what was meant by these remarkable expressions. The first inquiry is whether the term Devil, as here used, actually representsthe malignant Deity of the Christians, or an antagonistic, blind force--the darkside of nature. By the latter we are not to understand the manifestation of anyevil principle that is malum in se, but only the shadow of the Light, so to say.The theories of the kabalists treat of it as a force which is antagonistic, butat the same time essential to the vitality, evolving, and vigor of the goodprinciple. Plants would perish in their first stage of existence, if they werekept exposed to a constant sunlight; the night alternating with the day isessential to their healthy growth and development. Goodness, likewise, wouldspeedily cease to be such, were it not alternated by its opposite. In humannature, evil denotes the antagonism of matter to the spiritual, and each isaccordingly purified thereby. In the cosmos, the equilibrium must be preserved;the operation of the two contraries produce harmony, like the centripetal andcentrifugal forces, and are necessary to each other. If one is arrested, theaction of the other will immediately become destructive. This personification, denominated Satan, is to be contemplated from threedifferent planes: the Old Testament, the Christian Fathers, and the ancientGentile altitude. He is supposed to have been represented by the Serpent in theGarden of Eden; nevertheless, the epithet of Satan is nowhere in the Hebrewsacred writings applied to that or any other variety of ophidian. The BrazenSerpent of Moses was worshipped by the Israelites as a god; * being the symbolof Esmun-Asklepius the Phoenician Iao. Indeed, the character of Satan himself isintroduced in the 1st book of Chronicles in the act of instigating King David tonumber the Israelitish people, an act elsewhere declared specifically to havebeen moved by Jehovah himself. ** The inference is unavoidable that the two,Satan and Jehovah, were regarded as identical. Another mention of Satan is found in the prophecies of Zechariah. This book waswritten at a period subsequent to the Jewish colonization of Palestine, andhence, the Asideans may fairly be supposed to have brought the personificationthither from the East. It is well-known that this body of sectaries were deeplyimbued with the Mazdean notions; and that they represented Ahriman orAnra-manyas by the god-names of Syria. Set or Sat-an, the god of the Hittitesand Hyk-sos, and Beel-Zebub the oracle-god, afterward the Grecian Apollo. Theprophet began his labors in Judea in the second year of Darius Hystaspes, therestorer of the Mazdean worship. He thus describes the encounter with Satan: \"Heshowed me Joshua the high-priest standing before the angel of the Lord, andSatan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. And the Lord said untoSatan: 'The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalemrebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?' \" *** We apprehend that this passage which we have quoted is symbolical. There are twoallusions in the New Testament that indicate that it was so regarded. TheCatholic Epistle of Jude refers to it in this peculiar language: \"Yet Michaelthe archangel, when contending with the Devil, he disputed about the body ofMoses, did not venture to utter to him a reviling judgment (Κρισιν επενεγκεινΒλασπηεμιας), but said, 'The Lord rebuke thee.' \" * The archangel Michael isthus mentioned as identical with the [images/00024.jpg]Lord, or angel of theLord, of the preceding quotation, and thus is shown that the Hebrew Jehovah hada twofold character, the secret and that manifested as the angel of the Lord, orMichael the archangel. A comparison between these two passages renders it plainthat \"the body of Moses\" over which they contended was Palestine, which as \"theland of the Hittites\" ** was the peculiar domain of Seth, their tutelar god. ***Michael, as the champion of the Jehovah-worship, contended with the Devil orAdversary, but left judgment to his superior. Belial is not entitled to the distinction of either god or devil. The term[images/00109.jpg], BELIAL, is defined in the Hebrew lexicons to mean adestroying, waste, uselessness; or the phrase [images/00110.jpg]AIS-BELIAL orBelial-man signifies a wasteful, useless man. If Belial must be personified toplease our religious friends, we would be obliged to make him perfectly distinctfrom Satan, and to consider him as a sort of spiritual \"Diakka.\" Thedemonographers, however, who enumerate nine distinct orders of daimonia, makehim chief of the third class--a set of hobgoblins, mischievous andgood-for-nothing. Asmodeus is no Jewish spirit at all, his origin being purely Persian. Breal, theauthor of Hercule et Cacus, shows that he is the Parsi Eshem-Dev, or Aeshma-dev,the evil spirit of concupiscence, whom Max Muller tells us \"is mentioned severaltimes in the Avesta as one of the Devs, ****originally gods, who became evilspirits.\" In the same fargard of the \"Vendidad\" the Brahman divinities are involved in thesame denunciation with Æshma-daeva: \"I combat India, I combat Sauru, I combat p.483 the Daeva Naonhaiti.\" The annotator explains them to be the Vedic gods,Indus, Gaurea, or Siva, and the two Aswins. There must be some mistake, however,for Siva, at the time the \"Vedas\" were completed, was an aboriginal or ÆthiopianGod, the Bala or Bel of Western Asia. He was not an Aryan or Vedic deity.Perhaps Surya was the divinity intended.} Samael is Satan; but Bryan and a good many other authorities show it to be thename of the \"Simoun\"--the wind of the desert, * and the Simoun is calledAtabul-os or Diabolos. Plutarch remarks that by Typhon was understood anything violent, unruly, anddisorderly. The overflowing of the Nile was called by the Egyptians Typhon.Lower Egypt is very flat, and any mounds built along the river to prevent thefrequent inundations, were called Typhonian or Taphos; hence, the origin ofTyphon. Plutarch, who was a rigid, orthodox Greek, and never known to muchcompliment the Egyptians, testifies in his Isis and Osiris, to the fact that,far from worshipping the Devil (of which Christians accused them), they despisedmore than they dreaded Typhon. In his symbol of the opposing, obstinate power ofnature, they believed him to be a poor, struggling, half-dead divinity. Thus,even at that remote age, we see the ancients already too enlightened to believein a personal devil. As Typhon was represented in one of his symbols under thefigure of an ass at the festival of the sun's sacrifices, the Egyptian priestsexhorted the faithful worshippers not to carry gold ornaments upon their bodiesfor fear of giving food to the ass! ** Three and a half centuries before Christ, Plato expressed his opinion of evil bysaying that \"there is in matter a blind, refractory force, which resists thewill of the Great Artificer.\" This blind force, under Christian influx, was madeto see and become responsible; it was transformed into Satan! His identity with Typhon can scarcely be doubted upon reading the account in Jobof his appearance with the sons of God, before the Lord. He accuses Job of areadiness to curse the Lord to his face upon sufficient provocation. So Typhon,in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, figures as the accuser. The resemblanceextends even to the names, for one of Typhon's appellations was Seth, or Seph;as Satan, in Hebrew, means an adversary. In Arabic the word is Shatana--to beadverse, to persecute, and Manetho says he had treacherously murdered Osiris andallied himself with the Shemites (the Israelites). This may possibly haveoriginated the fable told by Plutarch, that, from the fight between Horus andTyphon, Typhon, overcome with fright at the mischief he had caused, \"fled sevendays on an ass, and escaping, begat the boys Ierosolumos and Ioudaios (Jerusalemand Judea).\" Referring to an invocation of Typhon-Seth, Professor Reuvens says that theEgyptians worshipped Typhon under the form of an ass; and according to him Seth\"appears gradually among the Semites as the background of their religiousconsciousness.\" * The name of the ass in Coptic, AO, is a phonetic of IAO, andhence the animal became a pun-symbol. Thus Satan is a later creation, sprungfrom the overheated fancy of the Fathers of the Church. By some reverse offortune, to which the gods are subjected in common with mortals, Typhon-Sethtumbled down from the eminence of the deified son of Adam Kadmon, to thedegrading position of a subaltern spirit, a mythical demon--ass. Religiousschisms are as little free from the frail pettiness and spiteful feelings ofhumanity as the partisan quarrels of laymen. We find a strong instance of theabove in the case of the Zoroastrian reform, when Magianism separated from theold faith of the Brahmans. The bright Devas of the Veda became, under thereligious reform of Zoroaster, daevas, or evil spirits, of the Avesta. EvenIndra, the luminous god, was thrust far back into the dark shadow ** in order toshow off, in a brighter light, Ahura-mazda, the Wise and Supreme Deity. The strange veneration in which the Ophites held the serpent which representedChristos may become less perplexing if the students would but remember that atall ages the serpent was the symbol of divine wisdom, which kills in order toresurrect, destroys but to rebuild the better. Moses is made a descendant ofLevi, a serpent-tribe. Gautama-Buddha is of a serpent-lineage, through the Naga(serpent) race of kings who reigned in Magadha. Hermes, or the god Taaut(Thoth), in his snake-symbol is Tet; and, according to the Ophite legends, Jesusor Christos is born from a snake (divine wisdom, or Holy Ghost), i.e., he becamea Son of God through his initiation into the \"Serpent Science.\" Vishnu,identical with the Egyptian Kneph, rests on the heavenly seven-headed serpent. The red or fiery dragon of the ancient time was the military ensign of theAssyrians. Cyrus adopted it from them when Persia became dominant. The Romansand Byzantines next assumed it; and so the \"great red dragon,\" from being thesymbol of Babylon and Nineveh, became that of Rome. *** The temptation, or probation, **** of Jesus is, however, the most dramaticoccasion in which Satan appears. As if to prove the designation of Apollo,Æsculapius, and Bacchus, Diobolos, or son of Zeus, he is also styled Diabolos,or accuser. The scene of the probation was the wilderness. In the desert aboutthe Jordan and Dead Sea were the abodes of the \"sons of the prophets,\" and theEssenes. *These ascetics used to subject their neophytes to probations,analogous to the tortures of the Mithraic rites; and the temptation of Jesus wasevidently a scene of this character. Hence, in the Gospel according to Luke, itis stated that \"the Diabolos, having completed the probation, left him for aspecific time, αχρι καιρου, and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit intoGalilee.\" But the διαβολος, or Devil, in this instance is evidently no malignantprinciple, but one exercising discipline. In this sense the terms Devil andSatan are repeatedly employed. ** Thus, when Paul was liable to undue elation byreason of the abundance of revelations or epoptic disclosures, there was givenhim \"a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satanas,\" to check him. *** The story of Satan in the Book of Job is of a similar character. He isintroduced among the \"Sons of God,\" presenting themselves before the Lord, as ina Mystic initiation. Micaiah the prophet describes a similar scene, where he\"saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of Heaven standing byHim,\" with whom He took counsel, which resulted in putting \"a lying spirit intothe mouth of the prophets of Ahab.\" **** The Lord counsels with Satan, and giveshim carte blanche to test the fidelity of Job. He is stripped of his wealth andfamily, and smitten with a loathsome disease. In his extremity, his wife doubtshis integrity, and exhorts him to worship God, as he is about to die. Hisfriends all beset him with accusations, and finally the Lord, the chiefhierophant Himself, taxes him with the uttering of words in which there is nowisdom, and with contending with the Almighty. To this rebuke Job yielded,making this appeal: \"I will demand of thee, and thou shalt declare unto me:wherefore do I abhor myself and mourn in dust and ashes?\" Immediately he wasvindicated. \"The Lord said unto Eliphaz . . . ye have not spoken of me the thingthat is right, as my servant Job hath.\" His integrity had been asserted, and hisprediction verified: \"I know that my Champion liveth, and that he will stand upfor me at a later time on the earth; and though after my skin my body itself becorroded away, yet even then without my flesh shall I see God.\" The predictionwas accomplished: \"I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mineeye seeth thee. . . . And the Lord turned the captivity of Job.\" In all these scenes there is manifested no such malignant diabolism as issupposed to characterize \"the adversary of souls.\" It is an opinion of certain writers of merit and learning, that the Satan of thebook of Job is a Jewish myth, containing the Mazdean doctrine of the EvilPrinciple. Dr. Haug remarks that \"the Zoroastrian religion exhibits a closeaffinity, or rather identity with the Mosaic religion and Christianity, such asthe personality and attributes of the Devil, and the resurrection of thedead.\" * The war of the Apocalypse between Michael and the Dragon, can be tracedwith equal facility to one of the oldest myths of the Aryans. In the Avesta weread of war between Thraetaona and Azhi-Dahaka, the destroying serpent. Burnoufhas endeavored to show that the Vedic myth of Ahi, or the serpent, fightingagainst the gods, has been gradually euhemerized into \"the battle of a pious managainst the power of evil,\" in the Mazdean religion. By these interpretationsSatan would be made identical with Zohak or Azhi-Dahaka, who is a three-headedserpent, with one of the heads a human one. ** Beel-Zebub is generally distinguished from Satan. He seems, in the ApocryphalNew Testament, to be regarded as the potentate of the underworld. The name isusually rendered \"Baal of the Flies,\" which may be a designation of theScarabaei or sacred beetles. *** More correctly it shall be read, as it isalways given in the Greek text of the Gospels, Beelzebul, or lord of thehousehold, as is indeed intimated in Matthew x. 25: \"If they have called themaster of the house Beelzebul, how much more shall they call them of hishousehold.\" He was also styled the prince or archon of daemons. Typhon figures in the Book of the Dead, as the Accuser of souls when they appearfor judgment, as Satan stood up to accuse Joshua, the high-priest, before theangel, and as the Devil came to Jesus to tempt or test him during his great fastin the wilderness. He was also the deity denominated Baal-Tsephon, or god of thecrypt, in the book of Exodus, and Seth, or the pillar. During this period, theancient or archaic worship was more or less under the ban of the government; infigurative language, Osiris had been treacherously slain and cut in fourteen(twice seven) pieces, and coffined by his brother Typhon, and Isis had gone toByblos in quest of his body. We must not forget in this relation that Saba or Sabazios, of Phrygia andGreece, was torn by the Titans into seven pieces, and that he was, likeHeptaktis of the Chaldeans, the seven-rayed god. Siva, the Hindu, is representedcrowned with seven serpents, and he is the god of war and destruction. TheHebrew Jehovah the Sabaoth is also called the Lord of hosts, Seba or Saba,Bacchus or Dionysus Sabazios; so that all these may easily be proved identical. Finally the princes of the older regime, the gods who had, on the assault of thegiants, taken the forms of animals and hidden in Æthiopia, returned and expelledthe shepherds. According to Josephus, the Hyk-sos were the ancestors of the Israelites. * Thisis doubtless substantially true. The Hebrew Scriptures, which tell a somewhatdifferent story, were written at a later period, and underwent severalrevisions, before they were promulgated with any degree of publicity. Typhonbecame odious in Egypt, and shepherds \"an abomination.\" \"In the course of thetwentieth dynasty he was suddenly treated as an evil demon, insomuch that hiseffigies and name are obliterated on all the monuments and inscriptions thatcould be reached.\" ** In all ages the gods have been liable to be euhemerizedinto men. There are tombs of Zeus, Apollo, Hercules, and Bacchus, which areoften mentioned to show that originally they were only mortals. Shem, Ham, andJaphet, are traced in the divinities Shamas of Assyria, Kham of Egypt, andIapetos the Titan. Seth was god of the Hyk-sos, Enoch, or Inachus, of theArgives; and Abraham, Isaac, and Judah have been compared with Brahma, Ikshwaka,and Yadu of the Hindu pantheon. Typhon tumbled down from godhead to devilship,both in his own character as brother of Osiris, and as the Seth, or Satan ofAsia. Apollo, the god of day, became, in his older Phoenician garb, no more BaalZebul, the Oracle-god, but prince of demons, and finally the lord of theunderworld. The separation of Mazdeanism from Vedism, transformed the devas orgods into evil potencies. Indra, also, in the Vendidad is set forth as thesubaltern of Ahriman, * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu109.htm#fn_933]created by him out of the materials of darkness, ** together with Siva (Surya)and the two Aswins. Even Jahi is the demon of Lust--probably identical withIndra. The several tribes and nations had their tutelar gods, and vilified those ofinimical peoples. The transformation of Typhon, Satan and Beelzebub are of thischaracter. Indeed, Tertullian speaks of Mithra, the god of the Mysteries, as adevil. In the twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse, Michael and his angels overcame theDragon and his angels: \"and the Great Dragon was cast out, that Archaic Ophis,called Diabolos and Satan, that deceiveth the whole world.\" It is added: \"Theyovercame him by the blood of the Lamb.\" The Lamb, or Christ, had to descendhimself to hell, the world of the dead, and remain there three days before hesubjugated the enemy, according to the myth. Michael was denominated by the kabalists and the Gnostics, \"the Saviour,\" theangel of the Sun, and angel of Light. ( [images/00111.jpg], probably, from[images/00112.jpg]to manifest and [images/00113.jpg]God.) He was the first ofthe Æons, and was well-known to antiquarians as the \"unknown angel\" representedon the Gnostic amulets. The writer of the Apocalypse, if not a kabalist, must have been a Gnostic.Michael was not a personage originally exhibited to him in his vision (epopteia)but the Saviour and Dragon-slayer. Archaeological explorations have indicatedhim as identical with Anubis, whose effigy was lately discovered upon anEgyptian monument, with a cuirass and holding a spear, like St. Michael and St.George. He is also represented as slaying a Dragon, that has the head and tailof a serpent. *** The student of Lepsius, Champollion, and other Egyptologists will quicklyrecognize Isis as the \"woman with child,\" \"clothed with the Sun and with theMoon under her feet,\" whom the \"great fiery Dragon\" persecuted, and to whom\"were given two wings of the Great Eagle that she might fly into thewilderness.\" Typhon was red-skinned. * The Two Brothers, the Good and Evil Principles, appear in the Myths of the Bibleas well as those of the Gentiles, and Cain and Abel, Typhon and Osiris, Esau andJacob, Apollo and Python, etc., Esau or Osu, is represented, when born, as \"redall over like an hairy garment.\" He is the Typhon or Satan, opposing hisbrother. From the remotest antiquity the serpent was held by every people in the greatestveneration, as the embodiment of Divine wisdom and the symbol of spirit, and weknow from Sanchoniathon that it was Hermes or Thoth who was the first to regardthe serpent as \"the most spirit-like of all the reptiles\"; and the Gnosticserpent with the seven vowels over the head is but the copy of Ananta, theseven-headed serpent on which rests the god Vishnu. We have experienced no little surprise to find upon reading the latest Europeantreatises upon serpent-worship, that the writers confess that the public is\"still almost in the dark as to the origin of the superstition in question.\" Mr.C. Staniland Wake, M.A.I., from whom we now quote, says: \"The student ofmythology knows that certain ideas were associated by the peoples of antiquitywith the serpent, and that it was the favorite symbol of particular deities; butwhy that animal rather than any other was chosen for the purpose is yetuncertain.\" ** Mr. James Fergusson, F.R.S., who has gathered together such an abundance ofmaterial upon this ancient cult, seems to have no more suspicion of the truththan the rest. *** Our explanation of the myth may be of little value to students of symbology, andyet we believe that the interpretation of the primitive serpent-worship as givenby the initiates is the correct one. In Vol. i., p. 10, we quote from theserpent Mantra, in the Aytareya-Brahmana, a passage which speaks of the earth asthe Sarpa Rajni, the Queen of the Serpents, and \"the mother of all that moves.\"These expressions refer to the fact that before our globe had become egg-shapedor round it was a long trail of cosmic dust or fire-mist, moving and writhinglike a serpent. This, say the explanations, was the Spirit of God moving on thechaos until its breath had incubated cosmic matter and made it assume theannular shape of a serpent with its tail in its mouth--emblem of eternity in itsspiritual and of our world in its physical sense. According to the notions ofthe oldest philosophers, as we have shown in the preceding chapter, the earth,serpent-like, casts off its skin and appears after every minor pralaya in arejuvenated state, and after the great pralaya resurrects or evolves again fromits subjective into objective existence. Like the serpent, it not only \"puts offits old age,\" says Sanchoniathon, \"but increases in size and strength.\" This iswhy not only Serapis, and later, Jesus, were represented by a great serpent, buteven why, in our own century, big snakes are kept with sacred care in Moslemmosques; for instance, in that of Cairo. In Upper Egypt a famous saint is saidto appear under the form of a large serpent; and in India in some children'scradles a pair of serpents, male and female, are reared with the infant, andsnakes are often kept in houses, as they are thought to bring (a magnetic auraof) wisdom, health, and good luck. They are the progeny of Sarpa Rajni, theearth, and endowed with all her virtues. In the Hindu mythology Vasaki, the Great Dragon, pours forth upon Durga, fromhis mouth, a poisonous fluid which overspreads the ground, but her consort Sivacaused the earth to open her mouth and swallow it. Thus the mystic drama of the celestial virgin pursued by the dragon seeking todevour her child, was not only depicted in the constellations of heaven, as hasbeen mentioned, but was represented in the secret worship of the temples. It wasthe mystery of the god Sol, and inscribed on a black image of Isis. * The DivineBoy was chased by the cruel Typhon. ** In an Egyptian legend the Dragon is saidto pursue Thuesis (Isis) while she is endeavoring to protect her son. *** Oviddescribes Dione (the consort of the original Pelasgian Zeus, and mother ofVenus) as flying from Typhon to the Euphrates, **** thus identifying the myth asbelonging to all the countries where the Mysteries were celebrated. Virgil singsthe victory: \"Hail, dear child of gods, great son of Jove!Receive the honors great; the time is at hand;The Serpent will die!\" *****Albertus Magnus, himself an alchemist and student of occult science, as well asa bishop of the Roman Catholic Church, in his enthusiasm for astrology, declaredthat the zodiacal sign of the celestial virgin rises above the horizon on thetwenty-fifth of December, at the moment assigned by the Church for the birth ofthe Saviour. ****** The sign and myth of the mother and child were known thousands of years beforethe Christian era. The drama of the Mysteries of Demeter representsPersephoneia, her daughter, as carried away by Pluto or Hades into the world ofthe dead; and when the mother finally discovers her there, she has beeninstalled as queen of the realm of Darkness. This myth was transcribed by theChurch into the legend of St. Anna *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu109.htm#fn_945] going in quest of herdaughter Mary, who has been conveyed by Joseph into Egypt. Persephone isdepicted with two ears of wheat in her hand; so is Mary in the old pictures; sowas the Celestial Virgin of the constellation. Albumazar the Arabian indicatesthe identity of the several myths as follows: \"In the first decan of the Virgin rises a maid, called in Arabic Aderenosa[Adha-nari?], that is, pure immaculate virgin, ** graceful in person, charmingin countenance, modest in habit, with loosened hair, holding in her hands twoears of wheat, sitting upon an embroidered throne, nursing a boy, and rightlyfeeding him in the place called Hebraea; a boy, I say, named Iessus by certainnations, which signifies Issa, whom they also call Christ in Greek.\" *** At this time Grecian, Asiatic, and Egyptian ideas had undergone a remarkabletransformation. The Mysteries of Dionysus-Sabazius had been replaced by therites of Mithras, whose \"caves\" superseded the crypts of the former god, fromBabylon to Britain. Serapis, or Sri-Apa, from Pontus, had usurped the place ofOsiris. The king of Eastern Hindustan, Asoka, had embraced the religion ofSiddhartha, and sent missionaries clear to Greece, Asia, Syria, and Egypt, topromulgate the evangel of wisdom. The Essenes of Judea and Arabia, theTherapeutists **** of Egypt, and the Pythagorists ***** of Greece and MagnaGraecia, were evidently religionists of the new faith. The legends of Gautamasuperseded the myths of Horus, Anubis, Adonis, Atys, and Bacchus. These werewrought anew into the Mysteries and Gospels, and to them we owe the literatureknown as the Evangelists and the Apocryphal New Testament. They were kept by theEbionites, Nazarenes, and other sects as sacred books, which they might \"showonly to the wise\"; and were so preserved till the overshadowing influence of theRoman ecclesiastical polity was able to wrest them from those who kept them. At the time that the high-priest Hilkiah is said to have found the Book of theLaw, the Hindu Puranas (Scriptures) were known to the Assyrians. These last hadfor many centuries held dominion from the Hellespont to the Indus, and probablycrowded the Aryans out of Bactriana into the Punjab. The Book of the Law seemsto have been a purana. \"The learned Brahmans,\" says Sir William Jones, \"pretendthat five conditions are requisite to constitute a real purana: \"1. To treat of the creation of matter in general.\"2. To treat of the creation or production of secondary material and spiritualbeings.\"3. To give a chronological abridgment of the great periods of time.\"4. To give a genealogical abridgment of the principal families that reignedover the country.\"5. Lastly, to give the history of some great man in particular.\"It is pretty certain that whoever wrote the Pentateuch had this plan before him,as well as those who wrote the New Testament had become thoroughly wellacquainted with Buddhistic ritualistic worship, legends and doctrines, throughthe Buddhist missionaries who were many in those days in Palestine and Greece. But \"no Devil, no Christ.\" This is the basic dogma of the Church. We must huntthe two together. There is a mysterious connection between the two, more closethan perhaps is suspected, amounting to identity. If we collect together themythical sons of God, all of whom were regarded as \"first-begotten,\" they willbe found dovetailing together and blending in this dual character. Adam Kadmonbifurcates from the spiritual conceptive wisdom into the creative one, whichevolves matter. The Adam made from dust is both son of God and Satan; and thelatter is also a son of God, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu109.htm#fn_950] according to Job. Hercules was likewise \"the First-Begotten.\" He is also Bel, Baal, and Bal, andtherefore Siva, the Destroyer. Bacchus was styled by Euripides, \"Bacchus, theSon of God.\" As a child, Bacchus, like the Jesus of the Apocryphal Gospels, wasgreatly dreaded. He is described as benevolent to mankind; nevertheless he wasmerciless in punishing whomever failed of respect to his worship. Pentheus, theson of Cadmus and Hermione, was, like the son of Rabbi Hannon, destroyed for hiswant of piety. The allegory of Job, which has been already cited, if correctly understood, willgive the key to this whole matter of the Devil, his nature and office; and willsubstantiate our declarations. Let no pious individual take exception to thisdesignation of allegory. Myth was the favorite and universal method of teachingin archaic times. Paul, writing to the Corinthians, declared that the entirestory of Moses and the Israelites was typical; * and in his Epistle to theGalatians, asserted that the whole story of Abraham, his two wives, and theirsons was an allegory. ** Indeed, it is a theory amounting to certitude, that thehistorical books of the Old Testament were of the same character. We take noextraordinary liberty with the Book of Job when we give it the same designationwhich Paul gave the stories of Abraham and Moses. But we ought, perhaps, to explain the ancient use of allegory and symbology. Thetruth in the former was left to be deduced; the symbol expressed some abstractquality of the Deity, which the laity could easily apprehend. Its higher senseterminated there; and it was employed by the multitude thenceforth as an imageto be employed in idolatrous rites. But the allegory was reserved for the innersanctuary, when only the elect were admitted. Hence the rejoinder of Jesus whenhis disciples interrogated him because he spoke to the multitude in parables.\"To you,\" said he, \"it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,but to them it is not given. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and heshall have more abundance; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken awayeven that he hath.\" In the minor Mysteries a sow was washed to typify thepurification of the neophyte; as her return to the mire indicated thesuperficial nature of the work that had been accomplished. \"The Mythus is the undisclosed thought of the soul. The characteristic trait ofthe myth is to convert reflection into history (a historical form). As in theepos, so in the myth, the historical element predominates. Facts (externalevents) often constitute the basis of the myth, and with these, religious ideasare interwoven.\" The whole allegory of Job is an open book to him who understands thepicture-language of Egypt as it is recorded in the Book of the Dead. In theScene of Judgment, Osiris is represented sitting on his throne, holding in onehand the symbol of life, \"the hook of attraction,\" and in the other the mysticBacchic fan. Before him are the sons of God, the forty-two assessors of thedead. An altar is immediately before the throne, covered with gifts andsurmounted with the sacred lotus-flower, upon which stand four spirits. By theentrance stands the soul about to be judged, whom Thmei, the genius of Truth, iswelcoming to this conclusion of the probation. Thoth holding a reed, makes arecord of the proceedings in the Book of Life. Horus and Anubis, standing by thescales, inspect the weight which determines whether the heart of the deceasedbalances the symbol of truth, or the latter preponderates. On pedestal sits abitch--the symbol of the Accuser. Initiation into the Mysteries, as every intelligent person knows, was dramaticrepresentation of scenes in the underworld. Such was the allegory of Job. Several critics have attributed the authorship of this book to Moses. But it isolder than the Pentateuch. Jehovah is not mentioned in the poem itself; and ifthe name occurs in the prologue, the fact must be attributed to either an errorof the translators, or the premeditation exacted by the later necessity totransform polytheism into a monotheistic religion. The plan adopted was the verysimple one of attributing the many names of the Elohim (gods) to a single god.So in one of the oldest Hebrew texts of Job (in chapter xii. 9) there stands thename of Jehovah, whereas all other manuscripts have \"Adonai.\" But in theoriginal poem Jehovah is absent. In place of this name we find Al, Aleim, Ale,Shaddai, Adonai, etc. Therefore, we must conclude that either the prologue andepilogue were added at a later period, which is inadmissible for many reasons,or that it has been tampered with like the rest of the manuscripts. Then, wefind in this archaic poem no mention whatever of the Sabbatical Institution; buta great many references to the sacred number seven, of which we will speakfurther, and a direct discussion upon Sabeanism, the worship of the heavenlybodies prevailing in those days in Arabia. Satan is called in it a \"Son of God,\"one of the council which presents itself before God, and he leads him intotempting Job's fidelity. In this poem, clearer and plainer than anywhere else,do we find the meaning of the appellation, Satan. It is a term for the office orcharacter of public accuser. Satan is the Typhon of the Egyptians, barking hisaccusations in Amenthi; an office quite as respectable as that of the publicprosecutor, in our own age; and if, through the ignorance of the firstChristians, he became later identical with the Devil, it is through noconnivance of his own. The Book of Job is a complete representation of ancient initiation, and thetrials which generally precede this grandest of all ceremonies. The neophyte perceives himself deprived of everything he valued, and afflictedwith foul disease. His wife appeals to him to adore God and die; there was nomore hope for him. Three friends appear on the scene by mutual appointment:Eliphaz, the learned Temanite, full of the knowledge \"which wise men have toldfrom their fathers--to whom alone the earth was given\"; Bildad, theconservative, taking matters as they come, and judging Job to have donewickedly, because he was afflicted; and Zophar, intelligent and skilful with\"generalities\" but not interiorly wise. Job boldly responds: \"If I have erred,it is a matter with myself. You magnify yourselves and plead against me in myreproach; but it is God who has overthrown me. Why do you persecute me and arenot satisfied with my flesh thus wasted away? But I know that my Champion lives,and that at a coming day he will stand for me in the earth; and though, togetherwith my skin, all this beneath it shall be destroyed, yet without my flesh Ishall see God. . . . Ye shall say: 'Why do we molest him?' for the root of thematter is found in me!\" This passage, like all others in which the faintest allusions could be found toa \"Champion,\" \"Deliverer,\" or \"Vindicator,\" was interpreted into a directreference to the Messiah; but apart from the fact that in the Septuagint thisverse is translated: \"For I know that He is eternalWho is about to deliver me on earth,To restore this skin of mine which endures these things,\" etc.In King James's version, as it stands translated, it has no resemblance whateverto the original. * The crafty translators have rendered it, \"I know that myRedeemer liveth,\" etc. And yet Septuagint, Vulgate, and Hebrew original, haveall to be considered as an inspired Word of God. Job refers to his own immortalspirit which is eternal, and which, when death comes, will deliver him from hisputrid earthly body and clothe him with a new spiritual envelope. In theMysteries of Eleusinia, in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and all other workstreating on matters of initiation, this \"eternal being\" has a name. With theNeo-platonists it was the Nous, the Augoeides; with the Buddhists it is Aggra;and with the Persians, Ferwer. All of these are called the \"Deliverers,\" the\"Champions,\" the \"Metatrons,\" etc. In the Mithraic sculptures of Persia, theferwer is represented by a winged figure hovering in the air above its \"object\"or body. ** It is the luminous Self--the Atman of the Hindus, our immortalspirit, who alone can redeem our soul; and will, if we follow him instead ofbeing dragged down by our body. Therefore, in the Chaldean texts, the abovereads, \"My deliverer, my restorer,\" i.e., the Spirit who will restore thedecayed body of man, and transform it into a clothing of ether. And it is thisNous, Augoeides, Ferwer, Aggra, Spirit of himself, that the triumphant Job shallsee without his flesh--i.e., when he has escaped from his bodily prison, andthat the translators call \"God.\" Not only is there not the slightest allusion in the poem of Job to Christ, butit is now well proved that all those versions by different translators, whichagree with that of King James, were written on the authority of Jerome, who hastaken strange liberties in his Vulgate. He was the first to cram into the textthis verse of his own fabrication: \"I know that my Redeemer lives,And at the last day I shall arise from the earth,And again shall be surrounded with my skin,And in my flesh I shall see my God.\"All of which might have been a good reason for himself to believe in it since heknew it, but for others who did not, and who moreover found in the text a quitedifferent idea, it only proves that Jerome had decided, by one moreinterpolation, to enforce the dogma of a resurrection \"at the last day,\" and inthe identical skin and bones which we had used on earth. This is an agreeableprospect of \"restoration\" indeed. Why not the linen also, in which the bodyhappens to die? And how could the author of the Book of Job know anything of the New Testament,when evidently he was utterly ignorant even of the Old one? There is a totalabsence of allusion to any of the patriarchs; and so evidently is it the work ofan Initiate, that one of the three daughters of Job is even called by adecidedly \"Pagan\" mythological name. The name of Kerenhappuch is rendered invarious ways by the many translators. The Vulgate has \"horn of antimony\"; andthe LXX has the \"horn of Amalthea,\" the nurse of Jupiter, and one of theconstellations, emblem of the \"horn of plenty.\" The presence in the Septuagintof this heroine of Pagan fable, shows the ignorance of the transcribers of itsmeaning as well as the esoteric origin of the Book of Job. Instead of offering consolations, the three friends of the suffering Job seek tomake him believe that his misfortune must have come in punishment of someextraordinary transgressions on his part. Hurling back upon them all theirimputations, Job swears that while his breath is in him he will maintain hiscause. He takes in view the period of his prosperity \"when the secret of God wasupon his tabernacles,\" and he was a judge \"who sat chief, and dwelt as a king inthe army, or one that comforteth the mourners,\" and compares with it the presenttime--when vagrant Bedouins held him in derision, men \"viler than the earth,\"when he was prostrated by misfortune and foul disease. Then he asserts hissympathy for the unfortunate, his chastity, his integrity, his probity, hisstrict justice, his charities, his moderation, his freedom from the prevalentsun-worship, his tenderness to enemies, his hospitality to strangers, hisopenness of heart, his boldness for the right, though he encountered themultitude and the contempt of families; and invokes the Almighty to answer him,and his adversary to write down of what he had been guilty. To this there was not, and could not be, any answer. The three had sought tocrush Job by pleadings and general arguments, and he had demanded considerationfor his specific acts. Then appeared the fourth; Elihu, the son of Barachel theBuzite, of the kindred of Ram. * Elihu is the hierophant; he begins with a rebuke, and the sophisms of Job'sfalse friends are swept away like the loose sand before the west wind. \"And Elihu, the son of Barachel, spoke and said: 'Great men are not always wise. . . there is a spirit in man; the spirit within me constraineth me. . . . Godspeaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not. In a dream; in a vision ofthe night, when deep sleep falleth upon man, in slumberings upon the bed; thenhe openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction. O Job, hearken untome; hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee WISDOM.' \" And Job, who to the dogmatic fallacies of his three friends in the bitterness ofhis heart had exclaimed: \"No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall diewith you. . . . Miserable comforters are ye all. . . . Surely I would speak tothe Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. But ye are forgers of lies, yeare physicians of no value!\" The sore-eaten, visited Job, who in the face of theofficial clergy--offering for all hope the necessarianism of damnation, had inhis despair nearly wavered in his patient faith, answered: \"What ye know, thesame do I know also; I am not inferior unto you. . . . Man cometh forth like aflower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. . . .Man dieth, and wasteth away, yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? . .. If a man die shall he live again? . . . When a few years are come then I shallgo the way whence I shall not return. . . . O that one might plead for a manwith God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbor!\" Job finds one who answers to his cry of agony. He listens to the WISDOM ofElihu, the hierophant, the perfected teacher, the inspired philosopher. From hisstern lips comes the just rebuke for his impiety in charging upon the SUPREMEBeing the evils of humanity. \"God,\" says Elihu, \"is excellent in power, and injudgment, and in plenty of justice; HE will not afflict.\" So long as the neophyte was satisfied with his own worldly wisdom and irreverentestimate of the Deity and His purposes; so long as he gave ear to the pernicioussophistries of his advisers, the hierophant kept silent. But, when this anxiousmind was ready for counsel and instruction, his voice is heard, and he speakswith the authority of the Spirit of God that \"constraineth\" him: \"Surely Godwill not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. . . . He respectethnot any that are wise at heart.\" What better commentary than this upon the fashionable preacher, who \"multipliethwords without knowledge!\" This magnificent prophetic satire might have beenwritten to prefigure the spirit that prevails in all the denominations ofChristians. Job hearkens to the words of wisdom, and then the \"Lord\" answers Job \"out of thewhirlwind\" of nature, God's first visible manifestation: \"Stand still, O Job,stand still! and consider the wondrous works of God; for by them alone thoucanst know God. 'Behold, God is great, and we know him not,' Him who 'makethsmall the drops of water; but they pour down rain according to the vaporthereof' \"; * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu109.htm#fn_956] notaccording to the divine whim, but to the once established and immutable laws.Which law \"removeth the mountains and they know not; which shaketh the earth;which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars; . . .which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. . .. Lo, He goeth by me, and I see him not; he passeth on also, but I perceive himnot!\" ** Then, \"Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?\" ***speaks the voice of God through His mouthpiece--nature. \"Where wast thou when Ilaid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hathlaid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? When the morning stars sangtogether, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? . . . Wast thou present whenI said to the seas, 'Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shallthy proud waves be stayed?' . . . Knowest thou who hath caused it to rain on theearth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man. . . . Canstthou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? . ..Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, 'Here we are?'\" * \"Then Job answered the Lord.\" He understood His ways, and his eyes were openedfor the first time. The Supreme Wisdom descended upon him; and if the readerremain puzzled before this final PETROMA of initiation, at least Job, or the man\"afflicted\" in his blindness, then realized the impossibility of catching\"Leviathan by putting a hook into his nose.\" The Leviathan is OCCULT SCIENCE, onwhich one can lay his hand, but \"do no more,\" ** whose power and \"comelyproportion\" God wishes not to conceal. \"Who can discover the face of his garment, or who can come to him with hisdouble bridle? Who can open the doors of his face, 'of him whose scales are hispride, shut up together as with a closed seal?' Through whose 'neesings a lightdoth Shine,' and whose eyes are like the lids of the morning.\" Who \"maketh alight to shine after him,\" for those who have the fearlessness to approach him.And then they, like him, will behold \"all high things, for he is king only overall the children of pride.\" *** Job, now in modest confidence, responded: \"I know that thou canst do everything,And that no thought of thine can be resisted.Who is he that maketh a show of arcane wisdom,Of which he knoweth nothing?Thus have I uttered what I did not comprehend --Things far above me, which I did not know.Hear! I beseech thee, and I will speak;I will demand of thee, and do thou answer me:I have heard thee with my ears,And now I see thee with my eyes,Wherefore am I loathsome,And mourn in dust and ashes?\"He recognized his \"champion,\" and was assured that the time for his vindicationhad come. Immediately the Lord (\"the priests and the judges,\" Deuteronomy xix.17) saith to his friends: \"My wrath is kindled against thee and against thy twofriends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Jobhath.\" So \"the Lord turned the captivity of Job,\" and \"blessed the latter end ofJob more than his beginning.\" Then in the judgment the deceased invokes four spirits who preside over the Lakeof Fire, and is purified by them. He then is conducted to his celestial house,and is received by Athar and Isis, and stands before Atum, * the essential God.He is now Turu, the essential man, a pure spirit, and henceforth On-ati, the eyeof fire, and an associate of the gods. This grandiose poem of Job was well understood by the kabalists. While many ofthe mediaeval Hermetists were profoundly religious men, they were, in theirinnermost hearts--like kabalists of every age--the deadliest enemies of theclergy. How true the words of Paracelsus when worried by fierce persecution andslander, misunderstood by friends and foes, abused by clergy and laity, heexclaimed: \"O ye of Paris, Padua, Montpellier, Salerno, Vienna, and Leipzig! Ye are notteachers of the truth, but confessors of lies. Your philosophy is a lie. Wouldyou know what MAGIC really is, then seek it in St. John's Revelation. . . . Asyou cannot yourselves prove your teachings from the Bible and the Revelation,then let your farces have an end. The Bible is the true key and interpreter.John, not less than Moses, Elias, Enoch, David, Solomon, Daniel, Jeremiah, andthe rest of the prophets, was a magician, kabalist, and diviner. If now, all, oreven any of those I have named, were yet living, I do not doubt that you wouldmake an example of them in your miserable slaughter-house, and would annihilatethem there on the spot, and if it were possible, the Creator of all things too!\" That Paracelsus had learned some mysterious and useful things out of Revelationand other Bible books, as well as from the Kabala, was proved by himpractically; so much so, that he is called by many the \"father of magic andfounder of the occult physics of the Kabala and magnetism.\" ** So firm was the popular belief in the supernatural powers of Paracelsus, that tothis day the tradition survives among the simple-minded Alsatians that he is notdead, but \"sleepeth in his grave\" at Strasburg. *** And they often whisper amongthemselves that the green sod heaves with every respiration of that wearybreast, and that deep groans are heard as the great fire-philosopher awakes tothe remembrance of the cruel wrongs he suffered at the hands of his cruelslanderers for the sake of the great truth! It will be perceived from these extended illustrations that the Satan of the OldTestament, the Diabolos or Devil of the Gospels and Apostolic Epistles, were butthe antagonistic principle in matter, necessarily incident to it, and not wickedin the moral sense of the term. The Jews, coming from the Persian country,brought with them the doctrine of two principles. They could not bring theAvesta, for it was not written. But they--we mean the Asidians andPharsi--invested Ormazd with the secret name of [images/00024.jpg], and Ahrimanwith the name of the gods of the land, Satan of the Hittites, and Diabolos, orrather Diobolos, of the Greeks. The early Church, at least the Pauline part ofit, the Gnostics and their successors, further refined upon their ideas; and theCatholic Church adopted and adapted them, meanwhile putting their promulgatorsto the sword. The Protestant is a reaction from the Roman Catholic Church. It is necessarilynot coherent in its parts, but a prodigious host of fragments beating their wayround a common centre, attracting and repelling each other. Parts arecentripetally impelled towards old Rome, or the system which enabled old Rome toexist; parts still recoil under the centrifugal impulse, and seek to rush intothe broad ethereal region beyond Roman, or even Christian influence. The modern Devil is their principal heritage from the Roman Cybele, \"Babylon,the Great Mother of the idolatrous and abominable religions of the earth.\" But it may be argued, perhaps, that Hindu theology, both Brahmanical andBuddhistic, is as strongly impregnated with belief in objective devils asChristianity itself. There is a slight difference. This very subtlety of theHindu mind is a sufficient warrant that the well-educated people, the learnedportion, at least, of the Brahman and Buddhist divines, consider the Devil inanother light. With them the Devil is a metaphysical abstraction, an allegory ofnecessary evil; while with Christians the myth has become a historical entity,the fundamental stone on which Christianity, with its dogma of redemption, isbuilt. He is as necessary--as Des Mousseaux has shown--to the Church as thebeast of the seventeenth chapter of the Apocalypse was to his rider. TheEnglish-speaking Protestants, not finding the Bible explicit enough, haveadopted the Diabology of Milton's celebrated poem, Paradise Lost, embellishingit somewhat from Goethe's celebrated drama of Faust. John Milton, first aPuritan and finally a Quietist and Unitarian, never put forth his greatproduction except as a work of fiction, but it thoroughly dovetailed togetherthe different parts of Scripture. The Ilda-Baoth of the Ophites was transformedinto an angel of light, and the morning star, and made the Devil in the firstact of the Diabolic Drama. Then the twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse wasbrought in for the second act. The great red Dragon was adopted as the sameillustrious personage as Lucifer, and the last scene is his fall, like that ofVulcan-Hephaistos, from Heaven into the island of Lemnos; the fugitive hosts andtheir leader \"coming to hard bottom\" in Pandemonium. The third act is the Gardenof Eden. Satan holds a council in a hall erected by him for his new empire, anddetermines to go forth on an exploring expedition in quest of the new world. Thenext acts relate to the fall of man, his career on earth, the advent of theLogos, or Son of God, and his redemption of mankind, or the elect portion ofthem, as the case may be. This drama of Paradise Lost comprises the unformulated belief ofEnglish-speaking \"evangelical Protestant Christians.\" Disbelief of its mainfeatures is equivalent, in their view, to \"denying Christ\" and \"blasphemingagainst the Holy Ghost.\" If John Milton had supposed that his poem, instead ofbeing regarded as a companion of Dante's Divine Comedy, would have beenconsidered as another Apocalypse to supplement the Bible, and complete itsdemonology, it is more than probable that he would have borne his poverty moreresolutely, and withheld it from the press. A later poet, Robert Pollok, takinghis cue from this work, wrote another, The Course of Time, which bade fair for aseason to take the rank of a later Scripture; but the nineteenth century hasfortunately received a different inspiration, and the Scotch poet is fallinginto oblivion. We ought, perhaps, to make a brief notice of the European Devil. He is thegenius who deals in sorcery, witchcraft, and other mischief. The Fathers takingthe idea from the Jewish Pharisees, made devils of the Pagan gods, Mithras,Serapis, and the others. The Roman Catholic Church followed by denouncing theformer worship as commerce with the powers of darkness. The malefecii andwitches of the middle ages were thus but the votaries of the proscribed worship.Magic in all ancient times had been considered as divine science, wisdom, andthe knowledge of God. The healing art in the temples of Æsculapius, and at theshrines of Egypt and the East, had always been magical. Even Darius Hystaspes,who had exterminated the Median Magi, and even driven out the Chaldeantheurgists from Babylon into Asia Minor, had also been instructed by theBrahmans of Upper Asia, and, finally, while establishing the worship of Ormazd,was also himself denominated the instituter of magism. All was now changed.Ignorance was enthroned as the mother of devotion. Learning was denounced, andsavants prosecuted the sciences in peril of their lives. They were compelled toemploy a jargon to conceal their ideas from all but their own adepts, and toaccept opprobrium, calumny, and poverty. The votaries of the ancient worship were persecuted and put to death on chargesof witchcraft. The Albigenses, descendants of the Gnostics, and the Waldenses,precursors of the Protestants, were hunted and massacred under like accusations.Martin Luther himself was accused of companionship with Satan in proper person.The whole Protestant world still lies under the same imputation. There is nodistinction in the judgments of the Church between dissent, heresy, andwitchcraft. And except where civil authority protects, they are alike capitaloffences. Religious liberty the Church regards as intolerance. But the reformers were nursed with the milk of their mother. Luther was asbloodthirsty as the Pope; Calvin more intolerant than Leo or Urban. Thirty yearsof war depopulated whole districts of Germany, Protestants and Catholics cruelalike. The new faith too opened its batteries against witchcraft. The statutebooks became crimsoned with bloody legislation in Sweden, Denmark, Germany,Holland, Great Britain, and the North American Commonwealth. Whosoever was moreliberal, more intelligent, more free speaking than his fellows was liable toarrest and death. The fires that were extinguished at Smithfield were kindledanew for magicians; it was safer to rebel against a throne than to pursueabstruse knowledge outside the orthodox dead-line. In the seventeenth century Satan made a sortie in New England, New Jersey, NewYork, and several of the Southern colonies of North America, and Cotton Mathergives us the principal chronicles of his manifestation. A few years later hevisited the Parsonage of Mora, in Sweden, and Life in Dalecarlia was diversifiedwith the burning alive of young children, and the whipping of others at thechurch-doors on Sabbath-days. The skepticism of modern times has, however,pretty much driven the belief in witchcraft into Coventry; and the Devil inpersonal anthropomorphic form, with his Bacchus-foot, and his Pan-like goat'shorns, holds place only in the Encyclical Letters, and other effusions of theRoman Catholic Church. Protestant respectability does not allow him to be namedat all except with bated breath in a pulpit-enclosure. Having now set forth the biography of the Devil from his first advent in Indiaand Persia, his progress through Jewish, and both early and later ChristianTheology down to the latest phases of his manifestation, we now turn back toreview certain of the opinions extant in the earlier Christian centuries. Avatars or incarnations were common to the old religions. India had them reducedto a system. The Persians expected Sosiosh, and the Jewish writers looked for adeliverer. Tacitus and Suetonius relate that the East was full of expectation ofthe Great Personage about the time of Octavius. \"Thus doctrines obvious toChristians were the highest arcana of Paganism.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu109.htm#fn_965] The Maneros of Plutarchwas a child of Palestine; * his mediator Mithras, the Saviour Osiris is theMessiah. In our present \"Canonical Scriptures\" are to be traced the vestigia ofthe ancient worships; and in the rites and ceremonies of the Roman CatholicChurch we find the forms of the Buddhistical worship, its ceremonies andhierarchy. The first Gospels, once as canonical as any of the present four,contain pages taken almost entire from Buddhistical narratives, as we areprepared to show. After the evidence furnished by Burnouf, Asoma, Korosi, Beal,Hardy, Schmidt, and translations from the Tripitaka, it is impossible to doubtthat the whole Christian scheme emanated from the other. The \"MiraculousConception\" miracles and other incidents are found in full in Hardy's Manual ofBuddhism. We can readily realize why the Roman Catholic Church is anxious tokeep the common people in utter ignorance of the Hebrew Bible and the Greekliterature. Philology and comparative Theology are her deadliest enemies. Thedeliberate falsifications of Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Eusebius and Tertullian hadbecome a necessity. The Sibylline Books at that period seem to have been regarded with extraordinaryfavor. One can easily perceive that they were inspired from the same source asthose of the Gentile nations. Here is a leaf from Gallaeus: \"New Light has arisen:Coming from Heaven, it assumed a mortal form. . . .-- Virgin, receive God in thy pure bosom --And the Word flew into her womb:Becoming incarnate in Time, and animated by her body,It was found in a mortal image, and a Boy was createdBy a Virgin. . . . The new God-sent Star was adored by the Magi,The infant swathed was shown in a manger. . . .And Bethlehem was called \"God-called country of the Word.\" **This looks at first-sight like a prophecy of Jesus. But could it not mean aswell some other creative God? We have like utterances concerning Bacchus andMithras. \"I, son of Deus, am come to the land of the Thebans--Bacchus, whom formerlySemele (the Virgin), the daughter of Kadmus (the man from the East) bringsforth--being delivered by the lightning-bearing flame; and having taken a mortalform instead of God's, I have arrived.\" *** The Dionysiacs, written in the fifth century, serve to render this matter veryclear, and even to show its close connection with the Christian legend of thebirth of Jesus: Kore-Persephoneia* . . . you were wived as the Dragon's spouse,When Zeus, very coiled, his form and countenance changed,A Dragon-Bridegroom, coiled in love-inspiring fold . . .Glided to dark Kore's maiden couch . . .Thus, by the alliance with the Dragon of Æther,The womb of Persephone became alive with fruit,Bearing Zagreus, ** the Horned Child.\" ***Here we have the secret of the Ophite worship, and the origin of the Christianlater-revised fable of the immaculate conception. The Gnostics were the earliestChristians with anything like a regular theological system, and it is only tooevident that it was Jesus who was made to fit their theology as Christos, andnot their theology that was developed out of his sayings and doings. Theirancestors had maintained, before the Christian era, that the GreatSerpent--Jupiter, the Dragon of Life, the Father and \"Good Divinity,\" had glidedinto the couch of Semele, and now, the post-Christian Gnostics, with a verytrifling change, applied the same fable to the man Jesus, and asserted that thesame \"Good Divinity,\" Saturn (Ilda-Baoth), had, in the shape of the Dragon ofLife, glided over the cradle of the infant Mary. **** In their eyes the Serpentwas the Logos--Christos, the incarnation of Divine Wisdom, through his FatherEnnola and Mother Sophia. \"Now my mother, the Holy Spirit (Holy Ghost) took me,\" Jesus is made to say inthe Gospel of the Hebrews, ***** thus entering upon his part of Christos--theSon of Sophia, the Holy Spirit. ****** \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the POWER of the Highest shallovershadow thee; therefore, that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall becalled Son of God,\" says the angel (Luke i. 35). \"God . . . hath at the last of these days spoken to us by a Son,whom he hathappointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the Æons\" (Paul: Heb. i.). * All such expressions are so many Christian quotations from the Nonnus verse \" .. . through the Ætherial Draconteum,\" for Ether is the Holy Ghost or thirdperson of the Trinity--the Hawk-headed Serpent, the Egyptian Kneph, emblem ofthe Divine Mind ** and Plato's universal soul. \"I, Wisdom, came out of the mouth of the Most High, and covered the earth as acloud.\" *** Pimander, the Logos, issues from the Infinite Darkness, and covers the earthwith clouds which, serpentine-like, spread all over the earth (See Champollion'sEgypte). The Logos is the oldest image of God, and he is the active Logos, saysPhilo. **** The Father is the Latent Thought. This idea being universal, we find an identical phraseology to express it, amongPagans, Jews, and early Christians. The Chaldeo-Persian Logos is theOnly-Begotten of the Father in the Babylonian cosmogony of Eudemus. \"Hymn now,ELI, child of Deus,\" begins a Homeric hymn to the sun. ***** Sol-Mithra is an\"image of the Father,\" as the kabalistic Seir-Anpin. That of all the various nations of antiquity, there never was one which believedin a personal devil more than liberal Christians in the nineteenth century,seems hardly credible, and yet such is the sorrowful fact. Neither theEgyptians, whom Porphyry terms \"the most learned nation of the world,\" ******nor Greece, its faithful copyist, were ever guilty of such a crowning absurdity.We may add at once that none of them, not even the ancient Jews, believed inhell or an eternal damnation any more than in the Devil, although our Christianchurches are so liberal in dealing it out to the heathen. Wherever the word\"hell\" occurs in the translations of the Hebrew sacred texts, it is unfortunate.The Hebrews were ignorant of such an idea; but yet the gospels contain frequentexamples of the same misunderstanding. So, when Jesus is made to say (Matthewxvi. 18) \". . . and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it,\" in theoriginal text it stands \"the gates of death.\" Never is the word \"hell\"--as applied to the state of damnation, either temporaryor eternal--used in any passage of the Old Testament, all hellists to thecontrary, notwithstanding. \"Tophet,\" or \"the Valley of Hinnom\" (Isaiah lxvi. 24)bears no such interpretation. The Greek term \"Gehenna\" has also quite adifferent meaning, as it has been proved conclusively by more than one competentwriter, that \"Gehenna\" is identical with the Homeric Tartarus. In fact, we have Peter himself as authority for it. In his second Epistle (ii.2) the Apostle, in the original text, is made to say of the sinning angels thatGod \"cast them down into Tartarus.\" This expression too inconveniently recallingthe war of Jupiter and the Titans, was altered, and now it reads, in KingJames's version: \"cast them down to hell.\" In the Old Testament the expressions \"gates of death,\" and the \"chambers ofdeath,\" simply allude to the \"gates of the grave,\" which are specificallymentioned in the Psalms and Proverbs. Hell and its sovereign are both inventionsof Christianity, coeval with its accession to power and resort to tyranny. Theywere hallucinations born of the nightmares of the SS. Anthonys in the desert.Before our era the ancient sages knew the \"Father of Evil,\" and treated him nobetter than an ass, the chosen symbol of Typhon, \"the Devil.\" * Sad degenerationof human brains! As Typhon was the dark shadow of his brother Osiris, so Python is the evil sideof Apollo, the bright god of visions, the seer and the soothsayer. He is killedby Python, but kills him in his turn, thus redeeming humanity from sin. It wasin memory of this deed that the priestesses of the sun-god enveloped themselvesin the snake-skin, typical of the fabulous monster. Under its exhilaratinginfluence--the serpent's skin being considered magnetic--the priestesses fellinto magnetic trances, and \"receiving their voice from Apollo,\" they becameprophetic and delivered oracles. Again Apollo and Python are one and morally androgynous. The sun-god ideas areall dual, without exception. The beneficent warmth of the sun calls the germinto existence, but excessive heat kills the plant. While playing on hisseven-stringed planetary lyre, Apollo produces harmony; but, as well as othersun-gods, under his dark aspect he becomes the destroyer, Python. St. John is known to have travelled in Asia, a country governed by Magi andimbued with Zoroastrian ideas, and in those days full of Buddhist missionaries.Had he never visited those places and come in contact with Buddhists, it isdoubtful whether the Revelation would have been written. Besides his ideas ofthe dragon, he gives prophetic narratives entirely unknown to the otherapostles, and which, relating to the second advent, make of Christ a faithfulcopy of Vishnu. Thus Ophios and Ophiomorphos, Apollo and Python, Osiris and Typhon, Christos andthe Serpent, are all convertible terms. They are all Logoi, and one isunintelligible without the other, as day could not be known had we no night. Allare regenerators and saviours, one in a spiritual, the other in a physicalsense. One insures immortality for the Divine Spirit; the other gives it throughregeneration of the seed. The Saviour of mankind has to die, because he unveilsto humanity the great secret of the immortal ego; the serpent of Genesis iscursed because he said to matter, \"Ye shall not die.\" In the world of Paganismthe counterpart of the \"serpent\" is the second Hermes, the reincarnation ofHermes Trismegistus. Hermes is the constant companion and instructor of Osiris and Isis. He is thepersonified wisdom; so is Cain, the son of the \"Lord.\" Both build cities,civilize and instruct mankind in the arts. It has been repeatedly stated by the Christian missionaries in Ceylon and Indiathat the people are steeped in demonolatry; that they are devil-worshippers, inthe full sense of the word. Without any exaggeration we say that they are nomore so than the masses of uneducated Christians. But even were they worshippersof (which is more than believers in) the Devil, yet there is a great differencebetween the teachings of their clergy on the subject of a personal devil and thedogmas of Catholic preachers and many Protestant ministers also. The Christianpriests are bound to teach and impress upon the minds of their flock theexistence of the Devil, and the opening pages of the present chapter show thereason why. But not only will the Cingalese Oepasampala, who belong to thehighest priesthood, not confess to belief in a personal demon but even theSamenaira, the candidates and novices, would laugh at the idea. Everything inthe external worship of the Buddhists is allegorical and is never otherwiseaccepted or taught by the educated pungis (pundits). The accusation that theyallow, and tacitly agree to leave the poor people steeped in the most degradingsuperstitions, is not without foundation; but that they enforce suchsuperstitions, we most vehemently deny. And in this they appear to advantagebeside our Christian clergy, who (at least those who have not allowed theirfanaticism to interfere with their brains), without believing a word of it, yetpreach the existence of the Devil, as the personal enemy of a personal God, andthe evil genius of mankind. St. George's Dragon, which figures so promiscuously in the grandest cathedralsof the Christians, is not a whit handsomer than the King of Snakes, the BuddhistNammadanam-naraya, the great Dragon. If the planetary Demon Rawho, is believed,in the popular superstition of the Cingalese, to endeavor to destroy the moon byswallowing it; and if in China and Tartary the rabble is allowed, withoutrebuke, to beat gongs and make fearful noises to drive the monster away from itsprey during the eclipses, why should the Catholic clergy find fault, or callthis superstition? Do not the country clergy in Southern France do the same,occasionally, at the appearance of comets, eclipses, and other celestialphenomena? In 1456, when Halley's comet made its appearance, \"so tremendous wasits apparition,\" writes Draper, \"that it was necessary for the Pope himself tointerfere. He exorcised and expelled it from the skies. It slunk away into theabysses of space, terror-stricken by the maledictions of Calixtus III., and didnot venture back for seventy-five years!\" * We never heard of any Christian clergyman or Pope trying to disabuse ignorantminds of the belief that the Devil had anything to do with eclipses and comets;but we do find a Buddhist chief priest saying to an official who twitted himwith this superstition: \"Our Cingalese religious books teach that the eclipsesof the sun and moon denote an attack of Rahu ** (one of the nine planets) not bya devil.\" *** The origin of the \"Dragon\" myth so prominent in the Apocalypse and GoldenLegend, and of the fable about Simeon Stylites converting the Dragon, isundeniably Buddhistic and even pre-Buddhistic. It was Gautama's pure doctrineswhich reclaimed to Buddhism the Cashmerians whose primitive worship was theOphite or Serpent worship. Frankincense and flowers replaced the humansacrifices and belief in personal demons. It became the turn of Christianity toinherit the degrading superstition about devils invested with pestilential andmurderous powers. The Mahavansa, oldest of the Ceylonese books, relates thestory of King Covercapal (cobra-de-capello), the snake-god, who was converted toBuddhism by a holy Rahat; **** and it is earlier, by all odds, than the GoldenLegend which tells the same of Simeon the Stylite and his Dragon. The Logos triumphs once more over the great Dragon; Michael, the luminousarchangel, chief of the Æons, conquers Satan. * It is a fact worthy of remark, that so long as the initiate kept silent \"on whathe knew,\" he was perfectly safe. So was it in days of old, and so it is now. Assoon as the Christian God, emanating forth from Silence, manifested himself asthe Word or Logos, the latter became the cause of his death. The serpent is thesymbol of wisdom and eloquence, but it is likewise the symbol of destruction.\"To dare, to know, to will, and be silent,\" are the cardinal axioms of thekabalist. Like Apollo and other gods, Jesus is killed by his Logos; ** he risesagain, kills him in his turn, and becomes his master. Can it be that this oldsymbol has, like the rest of ancient philosophical conceptions, more than oneallegorical and never-suspected meaning? The coincidences are too strange to beresults of mere chance. And now that we have shown this identity between Michael and Satan, and theSaviours and Dragons of other people, what can be more clear than that all thesephilosophical fables originated in India, that universal hot-bed of metaphysicalmysticism? \"The world,\" says Ramatsariar, in his comments upon the Vedas,\"commenced with a contest between the Spirit of Good and the Spirit of Evil, andso must end. After the destruction of matter evil can no longer exist, it mustreturn to naught.\" *** In the Apologia, Tertullian falsifies most palpably every doctrine and belief ofthe Pagans as to the oracles and gods. He calls them, indifferently, demons anddevils, accusing the latter of taking possession of even the birds of the air!What Christian would now dare doubt such an authority? Did not the Psalmistexclaim: \"All the gods of the nations are idols\"; and the Angel of the School,Thomas Aquinas, explains, on his own kabalistic authority, the word idols bydevils? \"They come to men,\" he says, \"and offer themselves to their adoration byoperating certain things which seem miraculous.\" **** The Fathers were prudent as they were wise in their inventions. To be impartial,after having created a Devil, they set to creating apocryphal saints. We havenamed several in preceding chapters; but we must not forget Baronius, who havingread in a work of Chrysostom about the holy Xenoris, the word meaning a pair, acouple, mistook it for the name of a saint, and proceeded forthwith to create ofit a martyr of Antioch, and went on to give a most detailed and authenticbiography of the \"blessed martyr.\" Other theologians made of Apollyon--or ratherApolouon--the anti-Christ. Apolouon is Plato's \"washer,\" the god who purifies,who washes off, and releases us from sin, but he was thus transformed into him\"whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath hisname Apollyon\"--Devil! Max Muller says that the serpent in Paradise is a conception which might havesprung up among the Jews, and \"seems hardly to invite comparison with the muchgrander conceptions of the terrible power of Vritra and Ahriman in the Veda andAvesta.\" With the kabalists the Devil was always a myth--God or good reversed.That modern Magus, Eliphas Levi, calls the Devil l'ivresse astrale. It is ablind force like electricity, he says; and, speaking allegorically, as he alwaysdid, Jesus remarked that he \"bebeld Satan like lightning fall from Heaven.\" The clergy insist that God has sent the Devil to tempt mankind; which would berather a singular way of showing his boundless love to humanity! If the SupremeOne is really guilty of such unfatherly treachery, he is worthy, certainly, ofthe adoration only of a Church capable of singing the Te Deum over a massacre ofSt. Bartholomew, and of blessing Mussulman swords drawn to slaughter GreekChristians! This is at once sound logic and good sound law, for is it not a maxim ofjurisprudence: \"Qui facit per alium, facit per se\"? The great dissimilarity which exists between the various conceptions of theDevil is really often ludicrous. While bigots will invariably endow him withhorns, tail, and every conceivable repulsive feature, even including anoffensive human smell, * Milton, Byron, Goethe, Lermontoff, ** and a host ofFrench novelists have sung his praise in flowing verse and thrilling prose.Milton's Satan, and even Goethe's Mephistopheles, are certainly far morecommanding figures than some of the angels, as represented in the prose ofecstatic bigots. We have but to compare two descriptions. Let us first award thefloor to the incomparably sensational des Mousseaux. He gives us a thrillingaccount of an incubus, in the words of the penitent herself: \"Once,\" she tellsus, \"during the space of a whole half-hour, she saw distinctly near her anindividual with a black, dreadful, horrid body, and whose hands, of an enormoussize, exhibited clawed fingers strangely hooked. The senses of sight, feeling,and smell were confirmed by that of hearing!!\" * And yet, for the space of several years, the damsel suffered herself to be ledastray by such a hero. How far above this odoriferous gallant is the majesticfigure of the Miltonic Satan! Let the reader then fancy, if he can, this superb chimera, this ideal of therebellious angel become incarnate Pride, crawling into the skin of the mostdisgusting of all animals! Notwithstanding that the Christian catechism teachesus that Satan in propria persona tempted our first mother, Eve, in a realparadise, and that in the shape of a serpent, which of all animals was the mostinsinuating and fascinating! God orders him, as a punishment, to crawl eternallyon his belly, and bite the dust. \"A sentence,\" remarks Levi, \"which resembles innothing the traditional flames of hell.\" The more so, that the real zoologicalserpent, which was created before Adam and Eve, crawled on his belly, and bitthe dust likewise, before there was any original sin. Apart from this, was not Ophion the Daimon, or Devil, like God calledDominus? ** The word God (deity) is derived from the Sanscrit word Deva, andDevil from the Persian daeva, which words are substantially alike. Hercules, sonof Jove and Alcmena, one of the highest sun-gods and also Logos manifested, isnevertheless represented under a double nature, as all others. *** The Agathodaemon, the beneficent daemon, **** the same which we find later amongthe Ophites under the appellation of the Logos, or divine wisdom, wasrepresented by a serpent standing erect on a pole, in the BacchanalianMysteries. The hawk-headed serpent is among the oldest of the Egyptian emblems,and represents the divine mind, says Deane. ***** Azazel is Moloch and Samael,says Movers, ****** and we find Aaron, the brother of the great law-giver Moses,making equal sacrifices to Jehovah and Azazel. \"And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord (Ihoh in theoriginal) and one lot for the scape-goat\" (Azazel). In the Old Testament Jehovah exhibits all the attributes of old Saturn, *notwithstanding his metamorphoses from Adoni into Eloi, and God of Gods, Lord ofLords. ** Jesus is tempted on the mountain by the Devil, who promises to him kingdoms andglory if he will only fall down and worship him (Matthew iv. 8, 9). Buddha istempted by the Demon Wasawarthi Mara, who says to him as he is leaving hisfather's palace: \"Be entreated to stay that you may possess the honors that arewithin your reach; go not, go not! \" And upon the refusal of Gautama to accepthis offers, gnashes his teeth with rage, and threatens him with vengeance. LikeChrist, Buddha triumphs over the Devil. *** In the Bacchic Mysteries a consecrated cup was handed around after supper,called the cup of the Agathodaemon. **** The Ophite rite of the same descriptionis evidently borrowed from these Mysteries. The communion consisting of breadand wine was used in the worship of nearly every important deity. ***** In connection with the semi-Mithraic sacrament adopted by the Marcosians,another Gnostic sect, utterly kabalistic and theurgic, there is a strange storygiven by Epiphanius as an illustration of the cleverness of the Devil. In thecelebration of their Eucharist, three large vases of the finest and clearestcrystal were brought among the congregation and filled with white wine. Whilethe ceremony was going on, in full view of everybody, this wine wasinstantaneously changed into a blood-red, a purple, and then into an azure-bluecolor. \"Then the magus,\" says Epiphanius, \"hands one of these vases to a womanin the congregation, and asks her to bless it. When it is done, the magus poursout of it into another vase of much greater capacity with the prayer: \"May thegrace of God, which is above all, inconceivable, inexplicable, fill thy innerman, and augment the knowledge of Him within thee, sowing the grain ofmustard-seed in good ground. * Whereupon the liquor in the larger vase swellsand swells until it runs over the brim.\" ** In connection with several of the Pagan deities which are made after death, andbefore their resurrection to descend into Hell, it will be found useful tocompare the pre-Christian with the post-Christian narratives. Orpheus made thejourney, ** and Christ was the last of these subterranean travellers. In theCredo of the Apostles, which is divided in twelve sentences or articles, eachparticular article having been inserted by each particular apostle, according toSt. Austin **** the sentence \"He descended into hell, the third day he roseagain from the dead,\" is assigned to Thomas; perhaps, as an atonement for hisunbelief. Be it as it may, the sentence is declared a forgery, and there is noevidence \"that this creed was either framed by the apostles, or indeed, that itexisted as a creed in their time.\" ***** It is the most important addition in the Apostle's Creed, and dates since theyear of Christ 600. ****** It was not known in the days of Eusebius. BishopParsons says that it was not in the ancient creeds or rules offaith. *******Irenaeus, Origen, and Tertullian exhibit no knowledge of thissentence. ******** It is not mentioned in any of the Councils before the seventhcentury. Theodoret, Epiphanius, and Socrates are silent about it. It differsfrom the creed in St. Augustine. ********* Ruffinus affirms that in his time itwas neither in the Roman nor in the Oriental creeds (Exposit., in Symbol. Apost.§ 10). But the problem is solved when we learn that ages ago Hermes spoke thusto Prometheus, chained on the arid rocks of the Caucasian mount: \"To such labors look thou for no termination, UNTIL SOME GOD SHALL APPEAR AS ASUBSTITUTE IN THY PANGS, AND SHALL BE WILLING TO GO BOTH TO GLOOMY HADES AND TOTHE MURKY DEPTHS AROUND TARTARUS!\" (ÆSCHYLUS: Prometheus, 1027, ff.). This god was Herakles, the \"Only-Begotten One,\" and the Saviour. And it is hewho was chosen as a model by the ingenious Fathers. Hercules--calledAlexicacos--for he brought round the wicked and converted them to virtue; Soter,or Saviour, also called Neulos Eumelos--the Good Shepherd; Astrochiton, thestar-clothed, and the Lord of Fire. \"He sought not to subject nations by forcebut by divine wisdom and persuasion,\" says Lucian. \"Herakles spread cultivationand a mild religion, and destroyed the doctrine of eternal punishment bydragging Kerberus (the Pagan Devil) from the nether world.\" And, as we see, itwas Herakles again who liberated Prometheus (the Adam of the pagans), by puttingan end to the torture inflicted on him for his transgressions, by descending tothe Hades, and going round the Tartarus. Like Christ he appeared as a substitutefor the pangs of humanity, by offering himself in a self-sacrifice on afunereal-burning pile. \"His voluntary immolation,\" says Bart, \"betokened theethereal new birth of men. . . . Through the release of Prometheus, and theerection of altars, we behold in him the mediator between the old and newfaiths. . . . He abolished human sacrifice wherever he found it practiced. Hedescended into the sombre realm of Pluto, as a shade . . . he ascended as aspirit to his father Zeus in Olympus.\" So much was antiquity impressed by the Heraklean legend, that even themonotheistic (?) Jews of those days, not to be outdone by their contemporaries,put him to use in their manufacture of original fables. Herakles is accused inhis mythobiography of an attempted theft of the Delphian oracle. In SepherToldos Jeschu, the Rabbins accuse Jesus of stealing from their Sanctuary theIncommunicable Name! Therefore it is but natural to find his numerous adventures, worldly andreligious, mirrored so faithfully in the Descent into Hell. For extraordinarydaring of mendacity, and unblushing plagiarism, the Gospel of Nicodemus, onlynow proclaimed apocryphal, surpasses anything we have read. Let the readerjudge. At the beginning of chapter xvi., Satan and the \"Prince of Hell\" are describedas peacefully conversing together. All of a sudden, both are startled by \"avoice as of thunder\" and the rushing of winds, which bids them to lift up theirgates for \"the King of Glory shall come in.\" Whereupon the Prince of Hellhearing this \"begins quarrelling with Satan for minding his duty so poorly, asnot to have taken the necessary precautions against such a visit.\" The quarrelends with the prince casting Satan \"forth from his hell,\" ordering, at the sametime, his impious officers \"to shut the brass gates of cruelty, make them fastwith iron bars, and fight courageously lest we be taken captives.\" But \"when all the company of the saints . . . (in Hell?) heard this, they spokewith a loud voice of anger to the Prince of Darkness, 'Open thy gates, that theKing of Glory may come in,' \" thereby proving that, the prince needed spokesmen. \"And the divine (?) prophet David cried out, saying: 'Did not I, when on earth,truly prophesy?' \" After this, another prophet, namely holy Isaiah spake in likemanner, \"Did not I rightly prophesy?\" etc. Then the company of the saints andprophets, after boasting for the length of a chapter, and comparing notes oftheir prophecies, begin a riot, which makes the Prince of Hell remark that, \"thedead never durst before behave themselves so insolently towards us\" (the devils,xviii. 6); feigning the while to be ignorant who it was claiming admission. Hethen innocently asks again: \"But who is the King of Glory?\" Then David tells himthat he knows the voice well, and understands its words, \"because,\" he adds, \"Ispake them by his Spirit.\" Perceiving finally that the Prince of Hell would notopen the \"brass doors of iniquity,\" notwithstanding the king-psalmist's voucherfor the visitor, he, David, concludes to treat the enemy \"as a Philistine, andbegins shouting: 'And now, thou filthy and stinking prince of hell, open thygates. . . . I tell thee that the King of Glory comes . . . let him enter in.' \" While he was yet quarrelling the \"mighty Lord appeared in the form of a man\" (?)upon which \"impious Death and her cruel officers are seized with fear.\" Thenthey tremblingly begin to address Christ with various flatteries and complimentsin the shape of questions, each of which is an article of creed. For instance:\"And who art thou, so powerful and so great who dost release the captives thatwere held in chains by original sin?\" asks one devil. \"Perhaps, thou art thatJesus,\" submissively says another, \"of whom Satan just now spoke, that by thedeath of the Cross thou wert about to receive the power over death?\" etc.Instead of answering, the King of Glory \"tramples upon Death, seizes the Princeof Hell, and deprives him of his power.\" Then begins a turmoil in Hell which has been graphically described by Homer,Hesiod, and their interpreter Preller, in his account of the AstronomicalHercules Invictus, and his festivals at Tyre, Tarsus, and Sardis. Having beeninitiated in the Attic Eleusinia, the Pagan god descends into Hades and \"when heentered the nether world he spread such terror among the dead that all of themfled!\" * The same words are repeated in Nicodemus. Follows a scene of confusion,horror, and lamenting. Perceiving that the battle is lost, the Prince of Hellturns tail and prudently chooses to side with the strongest. He against whom,according to Jude and Peter, even the Archangel Michael \"durst not bring arailing accusation before the Lord,\" is now shamefully treated by his ex-allyand friend, the \"Prince of Hell.\" Poor Satan is abused and reviled for all hiscrimes both by devils and saints; while the Prince is openly rewarded for histreachery. Addressing him, the King of Glory says thus: \"Beelzebub, the Princeof Hell, Satan the Prince shall now be subject to thy dominion forever, in theroom of Adam and his righteous sons, who are mine . . . Come to me, all ye mysaints, who were created in my image, who were condemned by the tree of theforbidden fruit, and by the Devil and death. Live now by the wood of my cross;the Devil, the prince of this world is overcome (?) and Death is conquered.\"Then the Lord takes hold of Adam by his right hand, of David by the left, and\"ascends from Hell, followed by all the saints,\" Enoch and Elias, and by the\"holy thief.\" * The pious author, perhaps through an oversight, omits to complete the cavalcade,by bringing up the rear with the penitent dragon of Simon Stylites and theconverted wolf of St. Francis, wagging their tails and shedding tears of joy! In the Codex of the Nazarenes it is Tobo who is \"the liberator of the soul ofAdam,\" to bear it from Orcus (Hades) to the place of LIFE. Tobo is Tob-Adonijah,one of the twelve disciples (Levites) sent by Jehosaphat to preach to the citiesof Judah the Book of the Law (2 Chron. xvii.). In the kabalistic books thesewere \"wise men,\" Magi. They drew down the rays of the sun to enlighten the sheol(Hades) Orcus, and thus show the way out of the Tenebrae, the darkness ofignorance, to the soul of Adam, which represents collectively all the \"souls ofmankind.\" Adam (Athamas) is Tamuz or Adonis, and Adonis is the sun Helios. Inthe Book of the Dead (vi. 231) Osiris is made to say: \"I shine like the sun inthe star-house at the feast of the sun.\" Christ is called the \"Sun ofRighteousness,\" \"Helios of Justice\" (Euseb.: Demons. Ev., v. 29), simply arevamping of the old heathen allegories; nevertheless, to have made it serve forsuch a use is no less blasphemous on the part of men who pretended to bedescribing a true episode of the earth-pilgrimage of their God! \"Herakles, who has gone out from the chambers of earth,Leaving the nether house of Plouton!\" **\"At THEE the Stygian lakes trembled; Thee the janitor of OrcusFeared. . . . Thee not even Typhon frightened. . . .Hail true SON of JOVE, GLORY added to the gods!\" *More than four centuries before the birth of Jesus, Aristophanes had written hisimmortal parody on the Descent into Hell, by Herakles. ** The chorus of the\"blessed ones,\" the initiated, the Elysian Fields, the arrival of Bacchus (whois Iacchos--Iaho--and Sabaoth) with Herakles, their reception with lightedtorches, emblems of new life and RESURRECTION from darkness, death unto light,eternal LIFE; nothing that is found in the Gospel of Nicodemus is wanting inthis poem: *** \"Wake, burning torches . . . for thou comestShaking them in thy hand, Iacche,Phosphoric star of the nightly rite!\" ****But the Christians accept these post-mortem adventures of their god, concoctedfrom those of his Pagan predecessors, and derided by Aristophanes four centuriesbefore our era, literally! The absurdities of Nicodemus were read in thechurches, as well as those of the Shepherd of Hermas. Irenaeus quotes the latterunder the name of Scripture, a divinely-inspired \"revelation\"; Jerome andEusebius both insist upon its being publicly read in the churches; andAthanasius observes that the Fathers \"appointed it to be read in confirmation offaith and piety.\" But then comes the reverse of this bright medal, to show oncemore how stable and trustworthy were the opinions of the strongest pillars of aninfallible Church. Jerome, who applauds the book in his catalogue ofecclesiastical writers, in his later comments terms it \"apocryphal and foolish\"!Tertullian, who could not find praise enough for the Shepherd of Hermas when aCatholic, \"began abusing it when a Montanist.\" ***** Chapter xiii. begins with the narrative given by the two resuscitated ghosts ofCharinus and Lenthius, the sons of that Simeon who, in the Gospel according toLuke (ii. 25-32), takes the infant Jesus in his arms and blesses God, saying:\"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace . . . for mine eyes haveseen thy salvation\" ****** These two ghosts have arisen from their cold tombs onpurpose to declare \"the mysteries\" which they saw after death in hell. They areenabled to do so only at the importunate prayer of Annas and Caiaphas, Nicodemus(the author), Joseph (of Arimathaea), and Gamaliel, who beseech them to revealto them the great secrets. Annas and Caiaphas, however, who bring the ghosts tothe synagogue at Jerusalem, take the precaution to make the two resuscitatedmen, who had been dead and buried for years, to swear on the Book of the Law \"byGod Adonai, and the God of Israel,\" to tell them only the truth. Therefore,after making the sign of the cross on their tongues, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu109.htm#fn_1021] they ask for some paperto write their confessions (xii. 21-25). They state how, when \"in the depth ofhell, in the blackness of darkness,\" they suddenly saw \"a substantial,purple-colored light illuminating the place.\" Adam, with the patriarchs andprophets, began thereupon to rejoice, and Isaiah also immediately boasted thathe had predicted all that. While this was going on, Simeon, their father,arrived, declaring that \"the infant he took in his arms in the temple was nowcoming to liberate them.\" After Simeon had delivered his message to the distinguished company in hell,\"there came forth one like a little hermit (?), who proved to be John theBaptist.\" The idea is suggestive and shows that even the \"Precursor\" and \"theProphet of the Most High,\" had not been exempted from drying up in hell to themost diminutive proportions, and that to the extent of affecting his brains andmemory. Forgetting that (Matthew xi.) he had manifested the most evident doubtsas to the Messiahship of Jesus, the Baptist also claims his right to berecognized as a prophet. \"And I, John,\" he says, \"when I saw Jesus coming to me,being moved by the Holy Ghost, I said: 'Behold the Lamb of God, who takes awaythe sins of the world' . . . And I baptized him . . . and I saw the Holy Ghostdescending upon him, and saying, 'This is my Beloved Son,' etc.\" And to think,that his descendants and followers, like the Mandeans of Basra, utterly rejectthese words! Then Adam, who acts as though his own veracity might be questioned in this\"impious company,\" calls his son Seth, and desires him to declare to his sons,the patriarchs and prophets, what the Archangel Michael had told him at the gateof Paradise, when he, Adam, sent Seth \"to entreat God that he would anoint\" hishead when Adam was sick (xiv. 2). And Seth tells them that when he was prayingat the gates of Paradise, Michael advised him not to entreat God for \"the oil ofthe tree of mercy wherewith to anoint father Adam for his headache; because thoucanst not by any means obtain it till the LAST DAY and times, namely till 5,500years be past.\" This little bit of private gossip between Michael and Seth was evidentlyintroduced in the interests of Patristic Chronology; and for the purpose ofconnecting Messiahship still closer with Jesus, on the authority of a recognizedand divinely-inspired Gospel. The Fathers of the early centuries committed aninextricable mistake in destroying fragile images and mortal Pagans, inpreference to the monuments of Egyptian antiquity. These have become the moreprecious to archaeology and modern science since it is found they prove thatKing Menes and his architects flourished between four and five thousand yearsbefore \"Father Adam\" and the universe, according to the biblical chronology,were created \"out of nothing.\" * \"While all the saints were rejoicing, behold Satan, the prince and captain ofdeath,\" says to the Prince of Hell: \"Prepare to receive Jesus of Nazarethhimself, who boasted that he was the Son of God, and yet was a man afraid ofdeath, and said: 'My soul is sorrowful even to death' \" (xv. 1, 2). There is a tradition among the Greek ecclesiastical writers that the \"Haeretics\"(perhaps Celsus) had sorely twitted the Christians on this delicate point. Theyheld that if Jesus were not a simple mortal, who was often forsaken by theSpirit of Christos, he could not have complained in such expressions as areattributed to him; neither would he have cried out with a loud voice: \"My god,My god! why hast thou forsaken me?\" This objection is very cleverly answered inthe Gospel of Nicodemus, and it is the \"Prince of Hell\" who settles thedifficulty. He begins by arguing with Satan like a true metaphysician. \"Who is that sopowerful prince,\" he sneeringly inquires, \"who is he so powerful, and yet a manwho is afraid of death? . . . I affirm to thee that when, therefore, he said hewas afraid of death, he designed to ensnare thee, and unhappy it will be to theefor everlasting ages!\" It is quite refreshing to see how closely the author of this Gospel sticks tohis New Testament text, and especially to the fourth evangelist. How cleverly heprepares the way for seemingly \"innocent\" questions and answers, corroboratingthe most dubious passages of the four gospels, passages more questioned andcross-examined in those days of subtile sophistry of the learned Gnostics thanthey are now; a weighty reason why the Fathers should have been even moreanxious to burn the documents of their antagonists than to destroy their heresy.The following is a good instance. The dialogue is still proceeding between Satanand the metaphysical half-converted Prince of the under world. \"Who, then, is that Jesus of Nazareth,\" naively inquires the prince, \"that byhis word hath taken away the dead from me, without prayers to God?\" (xv. 16). \"Perhaps,\" replies Satan, with the innocence of a Jesuit, \"it is the same whotook away from me LAZARUS, after he had been four days dead, and did both stinkand was rotten? . . . It is the very same person, Jesus of Nazareth. . . . Iadjure thee, by the powers which belong to thee and me, that thou bring him notto me!\" exclaims the prince. \"For when I heard of the power of his word, Itrembled for fear, and all my impious company were disturbed. And we were notable to detain Lazarus, but he gave himself a shake, and with all the signs ofmalice, he immediately went away from us; and the very earth, in which the deadbody of Lazarus was lodged, presently turned him alive.\" \"Yes,\" thoughtfullyadds the Prince of Hell, \"I know now that he is Almighty God, who is mighty inhis dominion, and mighty in his human nature, who is the Saviour of mankind.Bring not therefore this person hither, for he will set at liberty all those Iheld in prison under unbelief, and . . . will conduct them to everlasting life\"(xv. 20). Here ends the post-mortem evidence of the two ghosts. Charinus (ghost No. 1)gives what he wrote to Annas, Caiaphas, and Gamaliel, and Lenthius (ghost No. 2)his to Joseph and Nicodemus, having done which, both change into \"exceedinglywhite forms and were seen no more.\" To show furthermore that the \"ghosts\" had been all the time under the strictest\"test conditions,\" as the modern spiritualists would express it, the author ofthe Gospel adds: \"But what they had wrote was found perfectly to agree, the onenot containing one letter more or less than the other.\" This news spread in all the synagogues, the Gospel goes on to state, that Pilatewent to the temple as advised by Nicodemus, and assembled the Jews together. Atthis historical interview, Caiaphas and Annas are made to declare that theirScriptures testify \"that He (Jesus) is the Son of God and the Lord and King ofIsrael\" (!) and close the confession with the following memorable words: \"And so it appears that Jesus, whom we crucified, is Jesus Christ, the Son ofGod, and true and Almighty God. Amen.\" (!) Notwithstanding such a crushing confession for themselves, and the recognitionof Jesus as the Almighty God himself, the \"Lord God of Israel,\" neither the highpriest, nor his father-in-law, nor any of the elders, nor Pilate, who wrotethose accounts, nor any of the Jews of Jerusalem, who were at all prominent,became Christians. Comments are unnecessary. This Gospel closes with the words: \"In the name of theHoly Trinity [of which Nicodemus could know nothing yet] thus ends the Acts ofour Saviour Jesus Christ, which the emperor Theodosius the Great found atJerusalem, in the hall of Pontius Pilate among the public records\"; and whichhistory purports to have been written in Hebrew by Nicodemus, \"the things beingacted in the nineteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, emperor of the Romans, and inthe seventeenth year of the government of Herod, the son of Herod, king ofGalilee, on the eighth before the calends of April, etc., etc.\" It is the mostbarefaced imposture that was perpetrated after the era of pious forgeries openedwith the first bishop of Rome, whoever he may have been. The clumsy forger seemsto have neither known nor heard that the dogma of the Trinity was not propoundeduntil 325 years later than this pretended date. Neither the Old nor the NewTestament contains the word Trinity, nor anything that affords the slightestpretext for this doctrine (see page 177 of this volume, \"Christ's descent intoHell\"). No explanation can palliate the putting forth of this spurious gospel asa divine revelation, for it was known from the first as a premeditatedimposture. If the gospel itself has been declared apocryphal, nevertheless everyone of the dogmas contained in it was and is still enforced upon the Christianworld. And even the fact that itself is now repudiated, is no merit, for theChurch was shamed and forced into it. And so we are perfectly warranted in repeating the amended Credo of RobertTaylor, which is substantially that of the Christians. I believe in Zeus, the Father Almighty,And in his son, Iasios Christ our Lord,Who was conceived of the Holy Ghost,Born of the Virgin Elektra,Smitten with a thunderbolt,Dead and buried,He descended into Hell,Rose again and ascended up on high,And will return to judge the living and the dead.I believe in the Holy Nous,In the Holy circle of Great Gods,In the Community of Divinities,In the expiation of sins,The immortality of the SoulAnd the Life Everlasting.The Israelites have been proved to have worshipped Baal, the Syrian Bacchus,offered incense to the Sabazian or Æsculapian serpent, and performed theDionysian Mysteries. And how could it be otherwise if Typhon was called TyphonSet, * and Seth, the son of Adam, is identical with Satan or Sat-an; and Sethwas worshipped by the Hittites? Less than two centuries B.C., we find the Jewseither reverencing or simply worshipping the \"golden head of an ass\" in theirtemple; according to Apion, Antiochus Epiphanes carried it off with him. AndZacharias is struck dumb by the apparition of the deity under the shape of anass in the temple! ** In his able article \"Bacchus, the Prophet-God,\" Professor A. Wilder remarks that\"Tacitus was misled into thinking that the Jews worshipped an ass, the symbol ofTyphon or Seth, the Hyk-sos God. The Egyptian name of the ass was co, thephonetic of Iao\"; and hence, probably, he adds, \"a symbol from that merecircumstance.\" We can hardly agree with this learned archaeologist, for the ideathat the Jews reverenced, for some mysterious reason, Typhon under hissymbolical representation rests on more proof than one. And for one we find apassage in the \"Gospel of Mary,\" is cited from Epiphanius, which corroboratesthe fact. It relates to the death of \"Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist,murdered by Herod,\" says the Protevangelion. Epiphanius writes that the cause ofthe death of Zacharias was that upon seeing a vision in the temple he, throughsurprise, was willing to disclose it, but his mouth was stopped. That which hesaw was at the time of his offering incense, and it was a man STANDING IN THEFORM OF AN ASS. When he was gone out, and had a mind to speak thus to thepeople, Woe unto you, whom do ye worship? he who had appeared unto him in thetemple took away the use of his speech. Afterward when he recovered it, and wasable to speak, he declared this to the Jews, and they slew him. They (theGnostics) add in this book, that on this very account the high priest wascommanded by the law-giver (Moses) to carry little bells, that whensoever hewent into the temple to sacrifice, he whom they worshipped, hearing the noise ofthe bells, might have time enough to hide himself, and not be caught in thatugly shape and figure\" (Epiph.). El, the Sun-God of the Syrians, the Egyptians, and the Semites, is declared byPleyte to be no other than Set or Seth, and El is the primeval Saturn--Israel. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu109.htm#fn_1025] Siva is an Æthiopian God,the same as the Chaldean Baal--Bel; thus he is also Saturn. Saturn, El, Seth andKiyun, or the biblical Chiun of Amos, are all one and the same deity, and may beall regarded in their worst aspect as Typhon the Destroyer. When the religiousPantheon assumed a more definite expression, Typhon was separated from hisandrogyne--the good deity, and fell into degradation as a brutal unintellectualpower. Such reactions in the religious feelings of a nation were not unfrequent. TheJews had worshipped Baal or Moloch, the Sun-God Hercules, ** in their earlydays--if they had any days at all earlier than the Persians or Maccabees--andthen made their prophets denounce them. On the other hand, the characteristicsof the Mosaic Jehovah exhibit more of the moral disposition of Siva than of abenevolent, \"long-suffering\" God. Besides, to be identified with Siva is nosmall compliment, for the latter is God of wisdom. Wilkinson depicts him as themost intellectual of the Hindu gods. He is three-eyed, and, like Jehovah,terrible in his resistless revenge and wrath. And, although the Destroyer, \"yethe is the re-creator of all things in perfect wisdom.\" *** He is the type of St.Augustine's God who \"prepares hell for pryers into his mysteries,\" and insistson trying human reason as well as common sense by forcing mankind to view withequal reverence his good and evil acts. Notwithstanding the numerous proofs that the Israelites worshipped a variety ofgods, and even offered human sacrifices until a far later period than theirPagan neighbors, they have contrived to blind posterity in regard to truth. Theysacrificed human life as late as 169 B.C., **** and the Bible contains a numberof such records. At a time when the Pagans had long abandoned the abominablepractice, and had replaced the sacrificial man by the animal, ***** Jephthah isrepresented sacrificing his own daughter to the \"Lord\" for a burnt-offering. The denunciations of their own prophets are the best proofs against them. Theirworship in high places is the same as that of the \"idolaters.\" Theirprophetesses are counterparts of the Pythiae and Bacchantes. Pausanias speaks ofwomen-colleges which superintend the worship of Bacchus, and of the sixteenmatrons of Elis. * The Bible says that \"Deborah, a prophetess . . . judgedIsrael at that time\"; ** and speaks of Huldah, another prophetess, who \"dwelt inJerusalem, in the college\"; *** and 2 Samuel mentions \"wise women\" severaltimes, **** notwithstanding the injunction of Moses not to use either divinationor augury. As to the final and conclusive identification of the \"Lord God\" ofIsrael with Moloch, we find a very suspicious evidence of the case in the lastchapter of Leviticus, concerning things devoted not to be redeemed. . . . A manshall devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast. . . .None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed, but shall surelybe put to death . . . for it is most holy unto the Lord.\" ***** The duality, if not the plurality of the gods of Israel may be inferred from thevery fact of such bitter denunciations. Their prophets never approved ofsacrificial worship. Samuel denied that the Lord had any delight inburnt-offerings and sacrifices (1 Samuel, xv. 22). Jeremiah asserted,unequivocally, that the Lord, Yava Sabaoth Elohe Israel, never commandedanything of the sort, but contrariwise (vii. 21-24). But these prophets who opposed themselves to human sacrifices were all nazarsand initiates. These prophets led a party in the nation against the priests, aslater the Gnostics contended against the Christian Fathers. Hence, when themonarchy was divided, we find the priests at Jerusalem and the prophets in thecountry of Israel. Even Ahab and his sons, who introduced the Tyrian worship ofBaal-Hercules and the Syrian goddess into Israel, were aided and encouraged byElijah and Elisha. Few prophets appeared in Judea till Isaiah, after thenorthern monarchy had been overthrown. Elisha anointed Jehu on purpose that heshould destroy the royal families of both countries, and so unite the peopleinto one civil polity. For the Temple of Solomon, desecrated by the priests, noHebrew prophet or initiate cared a straw. Elijah never went to it, nor Elisha,Jonah, Nahum, Amos, or any other Israelite. While the initiates were holding tothe \"secret doctrine\" of Moses, the people, led by their priests, were steepedin idolatry exactly the same as that of the Pagans. It is the popular views andinterpretations of Jehovah that the Christians have adopted. The question is likely to be asked: \"In the view of so much evidence to showthat Christian theology is only a pot-pourri of Pagan mythologies, how can it beconnected with the religion of Moses?\" The early Christians, Paul and hisdisciples, the Gnostics and their successors generally, regarded Christianityand Judaism as essentially distinct. The latter, in their view, was anantagonistic system, and from a lower origin. \"Ye received the law,\" saidStephen, \"from the ministration of angels,\" or aeons, and not from the Most HighHimself. The Gnostics, as we have seen, taught that Jehovah, the Deity of theJews, was Ilda-Baoth, the son of the ancient Bohu, or Chaos, the adversary ofDivine Wisdom. The question may be more than easily answered. The law of Moses, and theso-called monotheism of the Jews, can hardly be said to have been more than twoor three centuries older than Christianity. The Pentateuch itself, we are ableto show, was written and revised upon this \"new departure,\" at a periodsubsequent to the colonization of Judea under the authority of the kings ofPersia. The Christian Fathers, in their eagerness to make their new systemdovetail with Judaism, and so avoid Paganism, unconsciously shunned Scylla onlyto be caught in the whirlpool of Charybdis. Under the monotheistic stucco ofJudaism was unearthed the same familiar mythology of Paganism. But we should notregard the Israelites with less favor for having had a Moloch and being like thenatives. Nor should we compel the Jews to do penance for their fathers. They hadtheir prophets and their law, and were satisfied with them. How faithfully andnobly they have stood by their ancestral faith under the most diabolicalpersecutions, the present remains of a once-glorious people bear witness. TheChristian world has been in a state of convulsion from the first to the presentcentury; it has been cleft into thousands of sects; but the Jews remainsubstantially united. Even their differences of opinion do not destroy theirunity. The Christian virtues inculcated by Jesus in the sermon on the mount are nowhereexemplified in the Christian world. The Buddhist ascetics and Indian fakirs seemalmost the only ones that inculcate and practice them. Meanwhile the vices whichcoarse-mouthed slanderers have attributed to Paganism, are current everywhereamong Christian Fathers and Christian Churches. The boasted wide gap between Christianity and Judaism, that is claimed on theauthority of Paul, exists but in the imagination of the pious. We are nought butthe inheritors of the intolerant Israelites of ancient days; not the Hebrews ofthe time of Herod and the Roman dominion, who, with all their faults, keptstrictly orthodox and monotheistic, but the Jews who, under the name ofJehovah-Nissi, worshipped Bacchus-Osiris, Dio-Nysos, the multiform Jove ofNyssa, the Sinai of Moses. The kabalistic demons--allegories of the profoundestmeaning--were adopted as objective entities, and a Satanic hierarchy carefullydrawn by the orthodox demonologists. The Rosicrucian motto, \"Igne natura renovatur integra,\" which the alchemistsinterpret as nature renovated by fire, or matter by spirit, is made to beaccepted to this day as Iesus Nazarenus rex Iudaeorum. The mocking satire ofPilate is accepted literally, and the Jews made to unwittingly confess therebythe royalty of Christ; whereas, if the inscription is not a forgery of theConstantinian period, it yet is the action of Pilate, against which the Jewswere first to violently protest. I. H. S. is interpreted Iesus Hominum Salvator,and In hoc signo, whereas ΙΕΣ is one of the most ancient names of Bacchus. Andmore than ever do we begin to find out, by the bright light of comparativetheology, that the great object of Jesus, the initiate of the inner sanctuary,was to open the eyes of the fanatical multitude to the difference between thehighest Divinity--the mysterious and never-mentioned IAO of the ancient Chaldeanand later Neo-platonic initiates--and the Hebrew Yahuh, or Yaho (Jehovah). Themodern Rosicrucians, so violently denounced by the Catholics, now find broughtagainst them, as the most important charge, the fact that they accuse Christ ofhaving destroyed the worship of Jehovah. Would to Heaven he could have beenallowed the time to do so, for the world would not have found itself stillbewildered, after nineteen centuries of mutual massacres, among 300 quarrellingsects, and with a personal Devil reigning over a terrorized Christendom! True to the exclamation of David, paraphrased in King James' Version as \"all thegods of the nations are idols,\" i.e., devils, Bacchus or the \"first-born\" or theOrphic theogony, the Monogenes, or \"only-begotten\" of Father Zeus and Kore, wastransformed, with the rest of the ancient myths, into a devil. By such adegradation, the Fathers, whose pious zeal could only be surpassed by theirignorance, have unwittingly furnished evidence against themselves. They have,with their own hands, paved the way for many a future solution, and greatlyhelped modern students of the science of religions. It was in the Bacchus-myth that lay concealed for long and dreary centuries boththe future vindication of the reviled \"gods of the nations,\" and the last clewto the enigma of Jehovah. The strange duality of Divine and mortalcharacteristics, so conspicuous in the Sinaitic Deity, begins to yield itsmystery before the untiring inquiry of the age. One of the latest contributionswe find in a short but highly-important paper in the Evolution, a periodical ofNew York, the closing paragraph of which throws a flood of light on Bacchus, theJove of Nysa, who was worshipped by the Israelites as Jehovah of Sinai. \"Such was the Jove of Nysa to his worshippers,\" concludes the author. \"Herepresented to them alike the world of nature and the world of thought. He wasthe 'Sun of righteousness, with healing on his wings,' and he not only broughtjoy to mortals, but opened to them hope beyond mortality of immortal life. Bornof a human mother, he raised her from the world of death to the supernal air, tobe revered and worshipped. At once lord of all worlds, he was in them all alikethe Saviour. \"Such was Bacchus, the prophet-god. A change of cultus, decreed by theMurderer-Imperial, the Emperor Theodosius, at the instance of Ghostly-FatherAmbrosius, of Milan, has changed his title to Father of Lies. His worship,before universal, was denominated Pagan or local, and his rites stigmatized aswitchcraft. His orgies received the name of Witches' Sabbath, and his favoritesymbolical form with the bovine foot became the modern representative of theDevil with the cloven hoof. The master of the house having been calledBeelzebub, they of his household were alike denounced as having commerce withthe powers of darkness. Crusades were undertaken; whole peoples massacred.Knowledge and the higher learning were denounced as magic and sorcery. Ignorancebecame the mother of devotion--such as was then cherished. Galileo languishedlong years in prison for teaching that the sun was in the centre of the solaruniverse. Bruno was burned alive at Rome in 1600 for reviving the ancientphilosophy; yet, queerly enough, the Liberalia have become a festival of theChurch, * Bacchus is a saint in the calendar four times repeated, and at many ashrine he may be seen reposing in the arms of his deified mother. The names arechanged; the ideas remain as before.\" ** And now that we have shown that we must indeed \"bid an eternal farewell to allthe rebellious angels,\" we naturally pass to an examination of the God Jesus,who was manufactured out of the man Jesus to redeem us from these very mythicaldevils, as Father Ventura shows us. This labor will of course necessitate oncemore a comparative inquiry into the history of Gautama-Buddha, his doctrines andhis \"miracles,\" and those of Jesus and the predecessor of both--Christna. [images/00002.jpg]FOOTNOTES474:* So firmly established seems to have been the reputation of the Brahmansand Buddhists for the highest morality, and that since time immemorial, that wefind Colonel Henry Yule, in his admirable edition of \"Marco Polo,\" giving thefollowing testimony: \"The high virtues ascribed to the Brahman and Indianmerchants were, perhaps, in part, matter of tradition . . . but the eulogy is soconstant among mediaeval travellers that it must have had a solid foundation. Infact, it would not be difficult to trace a chain of similar testimony fromancient times down to our own. Arrian says no Indian was ever accused offalsehood. Hwen T'sang ascribes to the people of India eminent uprightness,honesty, and disinterestedness. Friar Jordanus (circa 1330) says the people ofLesser India (Sindh and Western India) were true in speech and eminent injustice; and we may also refer to the high character given to the Hindus by AbulFazl. But after 150 years of European trade, indeed, we find a saddeterioration. . . .

It was finally overthrown by Cyrus and Darius Hystaspes, after\"1,000 years\" rule. Yima and Thraetaona, or Jemshid and Feridun, are doubtlesspersonifications.

Of late there has been a touching accord betweenphilologists holding high official positions, and missionaries from heathenlands. Prudence before truth when the latter endangers our sinecures! Besides,how easy to compromise with conscience. A State religion is a prop ofgovernment; all State religions are \"exploded humbugs\"; therefore, since one isas good, or rather as bad, as another, the State religion may as well besupported. Such is the diplomacy of official science. Grote in his History of Greece, assimilates the Pythagoreans to the Jesuits, andsees in their Brotherhood but an ably-disguised object to acquire politicalascendancy. On the loose testimony of Herakleitus and some other writers, whoaccused Pythagoras of craft, and described him as a man \"of extensive research .. . but artful for mischief and destitute of sound judgment,\" some historicalbiographers hastened to present him to posterity in such a character. How then if they must accept the Pythagoras painted by the satirical Timon: \"ajuggler of solemn speech engaged in fishing for men,\" can they avoid judging ofJesus from the sketch that Celsus has embalmed in his satire? Historicalimpartiality has nought to do with creeds and personal beliefs, and exacts asmuch of posterity for one as for the other. The life and doings of Jesus are farless attested than those of Pythagoras, if, indeed, we can say that they areattested at all by any historical proof. For assuredly no one will gainsay thatas a real personage Celsus has the advantage as regards the credibility of histestimony over Matthew, or Mark, or Luke, or John, who never wrote a line of theGospels attributed to them respectively. Withal Celsus is at least as good awitness as Herakleitus. He was known as a scholar and a Neo-platonist to some ofthe Fathers; whereas the very existence of the four Apostles must be taken onblind faith. If Timon regarded the sublime Samian as \"a juggler,\" so did Celsushold Jesus, or rather those who made all the pretenses for him. In his famouswork, addressing the Nazarene, he says: \"Let us grant that the wonders wereperformed by you . . . but are they not common with those who have been taughtby the Egyptians to perform in the middle of the forum for a few oboli.\" And weknow, on the authority of the Gospel according to Matthew, that the Galileanprophet was also a man of solemn speech, and that he called himself and offeredto make his disciples \"fishers of men.\" Let it not be imagined that we bring this reproach to any who revere Jesus asGod. Whatever the faith, if the worshipper be but sincere, it should berespected in his presence. If we do not accept Jesus as God, we revere him as aman. Such a feeling honors him more than if we were to attribute to him thepowers and personality of the Supreme, and credit him at the same time withhaving played a useless comedy with mankind, as, after all, his mission provesscarcely less than a complete failure; 2,000 years have passed, and Christiansdo not reckon one-fifth part of the population of the globe, nor is Christianitylikely to progress any better in the future. No, we aim but at strict justice,leaving all personality aside. We question those who, adoring neither Jesus,Pythagoras, nor Apollonius, yet recite the idle gossip of their contemporaries;those who in their books either maintain a prudent silence, or speak of \"ourSaviour\" and \"our Lord,\" as though they believed any more in the made-uptheological Christ, than in the fabulous Fo of China. There were no Atheists in those days of old; no disbelievers or materialists, inthe modern sense of the word, as there were no bigoted detractors. He who judgesthe ancient philosophies by their external phraseology, and quotes from ancientwritings sentences seemingly atheistical, is unfit to be trusted as a critic,for he is unable to penetrate into the inner sense of their metaphysics. Theviews of Pyrrho, whose rationalism has become proverbial, can be interpretedonly by the light of the oldest Hindu philosophy. From Manu down to the latestSwabhavika, its leading metaphysical feature ever was to proclaim the realityand supremacy of spirit, with a vehemence proportionate to the denial of theobjective existence of our material world--passing phantom of temporary formsand beings. The numerous schools begotten by Kapila, reflect his philosophy noclearer than the doctrines left as a legacy to thinkers by Timon, Pyrrho's\"Prophet,\" as Sextus Empiricus calls him. His views on the divine repose of thesoul, his proud indifference to the opinion of his fellow men, his contempt forsophistry, reflect in an equal degree stray beams of the self-contemplation ofthe Gymnosophists and of the Buddhist Vaibhashika. Notwithstanding that he andhis followers are termed, from their state of constant suspense, \"skeptics,\"\"doubters,\" inquirers, and ephectics, only because they postponed their finaljudgment on dilemmas, with which our modern philosophers prefer dealing,Alexander-like, by cutting the Gordian knot, and then declaring the dilemma asuperstition, such men as Pyrrho cannot be pronounced atheists. No more canKapila, or Giordano Bruno, or again Spinoza, who were also treated as atheists;nor yet, the great Hindu poet, philosopher, and dialectician, Veda-Vyasa, whoseprinciple that all is illusion--save the Great Unknown and His directessence--Pyrrho has adopted in full. These philosophical beliefs extended like a net-work over the wholepre-Christian world; and, surviving persecution and misrepresentations, form thecorner-stone of every now existing religion outside Christianity. Comparative theology is a two-edged weapon, and has so proved itself. But theChristian advocates, unabashed by evidence, force comparison in the serenestway; Christian legends and dogmas, they say, do somewhat resemble the heathen,it is true; but see, while the one teaches us the existence, powers, andattributes of an all-wise, all-good Father-God, Brahmanism gives us a multitudeof minor gods, and Buddhism none whatever; one is fetishism and polytheism, theother bald atheism. Jehovah is the one true God, and the Pope and Martin Lutherare His prophets! This is one edge of the sword, and this the other: Despitemissions, despite armies, despite enforced commercial intercourse, the \"heathen\"find nothing in the teachings of Jesus--sublime though some are--that Christnaand Gautama had not taught them before. And so, to gain over any new converts,and keep the few already won by centuries of cunning, the Christians give the\"heathen\" dogmas more absurd than their own, and cheat them by adopting thehabit of their native priests, and practicing the very \"idolatry and fetishism\"which they so disparage in the \"heathens.\" Comparative theology works both ways. In Siam and Burmah, Catholic missionaries have become perfect Talapoins to allexternal appearance, i.e., minus their virtues; and throughout India, especiallyin the south, they were denounced by their own colleague, the Abbe Dubois. *This was afterward vehemently denied. But now we have living witnesses to thecorrectness of the charge. Among others, Captain O'Grady, already quoted, anative of Madras, writes the following on this systematic method ofdeception: ** \"The hypocritical beggars profess total abstinence and horror offlesh to conciliate converts from Hinduism. . . . I got one father, or rather,he got himself gloriously drunk in my house, time and again, and the way hepitched into roast beef was a caution.\" Further, the author has pretty storiesto tell of \"black-faced Christs,\" \"Virgins on wheels,\" and of Catholicprocessions in general. We have seen such solemn ceremonies accompanied by themost infernal cacophony of a Cingalese orchestra, tam-tam and gongs included,followed by a like Brahmanic procession, which, for its picturesque coloring andmise en scene, looked far more solemn and imposing than the Christiansaturnalias. Speaking of one of these, the same author remarks: \"It was moredevilish than religious. . . . The bishops walked off Romeward, *** with amighty pile of Peter's pence gathered in the minutest sums, with gold ornaments,nose-rings, anklets, elbow bangles, etc., etc., in profusion, recklessly thrownin heaps at the feet of the grotesque copper-colored image of the Saviour, withits Dutch metal halo and gaudily-striped cummerbund and--shade of Raphael!--blueturban.\" **** As every one can see, such voluntary contributions make it quite profitable tomimic the native Brahmans and bonzes. Between the worshippers of Christna andChrist, or Avany and the Virgin Mary, there is less substantial difference, infact, than between the two native sects, the Vishnavites and the Sivites. Forthe converted Hindus, Christ is a slightly modified Christna, that is all.Missionaries carry away rich donations and Rome is satisfied. Then comes a yearof famine; but the nose-rings and gold elbow-bangles are gone and people starveby thousands. What matters it? They die in Christ, and Rome scatters herblessings over their corpses, of which thousands float yearly down the sacredrivers to the ocean. *****So servile are the Catholics in their imitation, andso careful not to give offense to their parishioners, that if they happen tohave a few higher caste converts in a Church, no pariah nor any man of the lowercastes, however good a Christian he may be, can be admitted into the same Churchwith them. And yet they dare call themselves the servants of Him who sought inpreference the society of the publicans and sinners; and whose appeal--\"Comeunto me all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" has opened to himthe hearts of millions of the suffering and the oppressed! Few writers are as bold and outspoken as the late lamented Dr. Thomas Inman, ofLiverpool, England. But however small their number, these men all agreeunanimously, that the philosophy of both Buddhism and Brahmanism must rankhigher than Christian theology, and teach neither atheism or fetishism. \"To myown mind,\" says Inman, \"the assertion that Sakya did not believe in God iswholly unsupported. Nay, his whole scheme is built upon the belief that thereare powers above which are capable of punishing mankind for their sins. It istrue that these gods were not called Elohim, nor Jah, nor Jehovah, nor Jahveh,nor Adonai, nor Ehieh, nor Baalim, nor Ashtoreth--yet, for the son ofSuddhadana, there was a Supreme Being.\" * There are four schools of Buddhist theology, in Ceylon, Thibet, and India. Oneis rather pantheistical than atheistical, but the other three are purelytheistical. On the first the speculations of our philologists are based. As to the second,third, and the fourth, their teachings vary but in the external mode ofexpression. We have fully explained the spirit of it elsewhere. As to practical, not theoretical views on the Nirvana, this is what arationalist and a skeptic says: \"I have questioned at the very doors of theirtemples several hundreds of Buddhists, and have not found one but strove,fasted, and gave himself up to every kind of austerity, to perfect himself andacquire immortality; not to attain final annihilation. \"There are over 300,000,000 of Buddhists who fast, pray, and toil. . . . Whymake of these 300,000,000 of men idiots and fools, macerating their bodies andimposing upon themselves most fearful privations of every nature, in order toreach a fatal annihilation which must overtake them anyhow?\" ** As well as this author we have questioned Buddhists and Brahmanists and studiedtheir philosophy. Apavarg has wholly a different meaning from annihilation. Itis but to become more and more like Him, of whom he is one of the refulgentsparks, that is the aspiration of every Hindu philosopher and the hope of themost ignorant is never to yield up his distinct individuality. \"Else,\" as onceremarked an esteemed correspondent of the author, \"mundane and separateexistence would look like God's comedy and our tragedy; sport to Him that wework and suffer, death to us to suffer it.\" The same with the doctrine of metempsychosis, so distorted by European scholars.But as the work of translation and analysis progresses, fresh religious beautieswill be discovered in the old faiths. Professor Whitney has in his translation of the Vedas passages in which he says,the assumed importance of the body to its old tenant is brought out in thestrongest light. These are portions of hymns read at the funeral services, overthe body of the departed one. We quote them from Mr. Whitney's scholarly work: \"Start onward! bring together all thy members;let not thy limbs be left, nor yet thy body;Thy spirit gone before, now follow after;Wherever it delights thee, go thou thither.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Collect thy body; with its every member;thy limbs with help of rites I fashion for thee.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .If some one limb was left behind by Agni,When to thy Fathers' world he hence conveyed you,That very one I now again supply you;rejoice in heaven with all your limbs, ye Fathers!\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu110.htm#fn_1044]The \"body\" here referred to is not the physical, but the astral one--a verygreat distinction, as may be seen. Again, belief in the individual existence of the immortal spirit of man is shownin the following verses of the Hindu ceremonial of incremation and burial. \"They who within the sphere of earth are stationed,or who are settled now in realms of pleasure,The Fathers who have the earth--the atmosphere--the heaven for their seat,The 'fore-heaven' the third heaven is styled,and where the Fathers have their seat.\"--(Rig-Veda, x.)With such majestic views as these people held of God and the immortality ofman's spirit, it is not surprising that a comparison between the Vedic hymns andthe narrow, unspiritual Mosaic books should result to the advantage of theformer in the mind of every unprejudiced scholar. Even the ethical code of Manuis incomparably higher than that of the Pentateuch of Moses, in the literalmeaning of which all the uninitiated scholars of two worlds cannot find a singleproof that the ancient Jews believed either in a future life or an immortalspirit in man, or that Moses himself ever taught it. Yet, we have eminentOrientalists who begin to suspect that the \"dead letter\" conceals something notapparent at first sight. So Professor Whitney tells us that \"as we look yetfurther into the forms of the modern Hindu ceremonial we discover not a littleof the same discordance between creed and observance; the one is not explainedby the other,\" says this great American scholar. He adds: \"We are forced to theconclusion either that India derived its system of rites from some foreignsource, and practiced them blindly, careless of their true import, or else thatthose rites are the production of another doctrine of older date, and havemaintained themselves in popular usage after the decay of the creed of whichthey were the original expression.\" * This creed has not decayed, and its hidden philosophy, as understood now by theinitiated Hindus, is just as it was 10,000 years ago. But can our scholarsseriously hope to have it delivered unto them upon their first demand? Or dothey still expect to fathom the mysteries of the World-Religion in its popularexoteric rites? No orthodox Brahmans and Buddhists would deny the Christian incarnation; only,they understand it in their own philosophical way, and how could they deny it?The very corner-stone of their religious system is periodical incarnations ofthe Deity. Whenever humanity is about merging into materialism and moraldegradation, a Supreme Spirit incarnates himself in his creature selected forthe purpose. The \"Messenger of the Highest\" links itself with the duality ofmatter and soul, and the triad being thus completed by the union of its Crown, asaviour is born, who helps restore humanity to the path of truth and virtue. Theearly Christian Church, all imbued with Asiatic philosophy, evidently shared thesame belief--otherwise it would have neither erected into an article of faiththe second advent, nor cunningly invented the fable of Anti-Christ as aprecaution against possible future incarnations. Neither could they haveimagined that Melchisedek was an avatar of Christ. They had only to turn to theBagavedgitta to find Christna or Bhagaved saying to Arjuna: \"He who follows meis saved by wisdom and even by works. . . . As often as virtue declines in theworld, I make myself manifest to save it.\" Indeed, it is more than difficult to avoid sharing this doctrine of periodicalincarnations. Has not the world witnessed, at rare intervals, the advent of suchgrand characters as Christna, Sakya-muni, and Jesus? Like the two latterpersonages, Christna seems to have been a real being, deified by his school atsome time in the twilight of history, and made to fit into the frame of thetime-honored religious programme. Compare the two Redeemers, the Hindu and theChristian, the one preceding the other by some thousands of years; place betweenthem Siddhartha Buddha, reflecting Christna and projecting into the night of thefuture his own luminous shadow, out of whose collected rays were shaped theoutlines of the mythical Jesus, and from whose teachings were drawn those of thehistorical Christos; and we find that under one identical garment of poeticallegend lived and breathed three real human figures. The individual merit of eachof them is rather brought out in stronger relief than otherwise by this samemythical coloring; for no unworthy character could have been selected fordeification by the popular instinct, so unerring and just when left untrammeled.Vox populi, vox Dei was once true, however erroneous when applied to the presentpriest-ridden mob. Kapila, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato, Basilides, Marcian, Ammonius and Plotinus,founded schools and sowed the germs of many a noble thought, and disappearingleft behind them the refulgence of demi-gods. But the three personalities ofChristna, Gautama, and Jesus appeared like true gods, each in his epoch, andbequeathed to humanity three religions built on the imperishable rock of ages.That all three, especially the Christian faith, have in time become adulterated,and the latter almost unrecognizable, is no fault of either of the nobleReformers. It is the priestly self-styled husbandmen of the \"vine of the Lord\"who must be held to account by future generations. Purify the three systems ofthe dross of human dogmas, the pure essence remaining will be found identical.Even Paul, the great, the honest apostle, in the glow of his enthusiasm eitherunwittingly perverted the doctrines of Jesus, or else his writings aredisfigured beyond recognition. The Talmud, the record of a people who,notwithstanding his apostasy from Judaism, yet feel compelled to acknowledgePaul's greatness as a philosopher and religionist, says of Aher (Paul), * in theYerushalmi, that \"he corrupted the work of that man\"--meaning Jesus. * Meanwhile, before this smelting is completed by honest science and futuregenerations, let us glance at the present aspect of the legendary threereligions. THE LEGENDS OF THREE SAVIOURS. CHRISTNA. Epoch: Uncertain. European science fears to commit itself. But the Brahmanicalcalculations fix it at about 6,877 years ago. Christna descends of a royal family, but is brought up by shepherds; is calledthe Shepherd God. His birth and divine descent are kept secret from Kansa. An incarnation of Vishnu, the second person of the Trimurti (Trinity). Christnawas worshipped at Mathura, on the river Jumna (See Strabo and Arrian and BamptonLectures, pp. 98-100). Christna is persecuted by Kansa, Tyrant of Madura, but miraculously escapes. Inthe hope of destroying the child, the king has thousands of male innocentsslaughtered. Christna's mother was Devaki, or Devanagui, an immaculate virgin (but had givenbirth to eight sons before Christna). GAUTAMA-BUDDHA. Epoch: According to European science and the Ceylonese calculations, 2,540 yearsago. Gautama is the son of a king. His first disciples are shepherds and mendicants. According to some, an incarnation of Vishnu; according to others, an incarnationof one of the Buddhas, and even of Ad'Buddha, the Highest Wisdom. Buddhist legends are free from this plagiarism, but the Catholic legend thatmakes of him St. Josaphat, shows his father, king of Kapilavastu, slayinginnocent young Christians (!!). (See Golden Legend.) Buddha's mother was Maya, or Mayadeva; married to her husband (yet an immaculatevirgin). JESUS OF NAZARETH. Epoch: Supposed to be 1877 years ago. His birth and royal descent are concealedfrom Herod the tyrant. Descends of the Royal family of David. Is worshipped by shepherds at his birth,and is called the \"Good Shepherd\" (See Gospel according to John). An incarnation of the Holy Ghost, then the second person of the Trinity, now thethird. But the Trinity was not invented until 325 years after his birth. Went toMathura or Matarea, Egypt, and produced his first miracles there (See Gospel ofInfancy). Jesus is persecuted by Herod, King of Judaea, but escapes into Egypt underconduct of an angel. To assure his slaughter, Herod orders a massacre ofinnocents, and 40,000 were slain. Jesus' mother was Mariam, or Miriam; married to her husband, yet an immaculatevirgin, but had several children besides Jesus. (See Matthew xiii. 55, 56.) CHRISTNA.Chistna is endowed with beauty, omniscience, and omnipotence from birth.Produces miracles, cures the lame and blind, and casts out demons. Washes thefeet of the Brahmans, and descending to the lowest regions (hell), liberates thedead, and returns to Vaicontha--the paradise of Vishnu. Christna was the GodVishnu himself in human form.Christna creates boys out of calves, and vice versa (Maurice's IndianAntiquities, vol. ii., p. 332). He crushes the Serpent's head. (Ibid.)Christna is Unitarian. He persecutes the clergy, charges them with ambition andhypocrisy to their faces, divulges the great secrets of the Sanctuary--the Unityof God and immortality of our spirit. Tradition says he fell a victim to theirvengeance. His favorite disciple, Arjuna, never deserts him to the last. Thereare credible traditions that he died on the cross (a tree), nailed to it by anarrow. The best scholars agree that the Irish Cross at Tuam, erected long beforethe Christian era, is Asiatic. (See Round Towers, p. 296, et seq., by O'Brien;also Reli gions GAUTAMA-BUDDHA.Buddha is endowed with the same powers and qualities, and performs similarwonders. Passes his life with mendicants. It is claimed for Gautama that he wasdistinct from all other Avatars, having the entire spirit of Buddha in him,while all others had but a part (ansa) of the divinity in them.Gautama crushes the Serpent's head, i.e., abolishes the Naga worship asfetishism; but, like Jesus, makes the Serpent the emblem of divine wisdom.Buddha abolishes idolatry; divulges the Mysteries of the Unity of God and theNirvana, the true meaning of which was previously known only to the priests.Persecuted and driven out of the country, he escapes death by gathering abouthim some hundreds of thousands of believers in his Buddhaship. Finally, dies,surrounded by a host of disciples, with Ananda, his beloved disciple and cousin,chief among them all. O'Brien believes that the Irish Cross at Tuam is meant forBuddha's, but Gautama was never crucified. He is represented in many temples, assitting JESUS OF NAZARETH.Jesus is similarly endowed. (See Gospels and the Apocryphal Testament.) Passeshis life with sinners and publicans. Casts out demons likewise. The only notabledifference between the three is that Jesus is charged with casting out devils bythe power of Beelzebub, which the others were not. Jesus washes the feet of hisdisciples, dies, descends to hell, and ascends to heaven, after liberating thedead.Jesus is said to have crushed the Serpent's head, agreeably to originalrevelation in Genesis. He also transforms boys into kids, and kids into boys.(Gospel of Infancy.)Jesus rebels against the old Jewish law; denounces the Scribes, and Pharisees,and the synagogue for hypocrisy and dogmatic intolerance. Breaks the Sabbath,and defies the Law. Is accused by the Jews of divulging the secrets of theSanctuary. Is put to death on a cross (a tree). Of the little handful ofdisciples whom he had converted, one betrays him, one denies him, and the othersdesert him at the last, except John--the disciple he loved. Jesus, Christna, andBuddha, all three Saviours, die either on or under trees, and are connected withcrosses which CHRISTNA.de l'Antiquie;Creuzer's Symbolik, vol. i., p. 208; and engraving in Dr. Lundy's MonumentalChristianity, p. 160.Christna ascends to Swarga and becomes Nirguna. GAUTAMA-BUDDHA.under a cruciform tree, which is the \"Tree of Life.\" In another image he issitting on Naga the Raja of Serpents with a cross on his breast. *Buddha ascends to Nirvana. JESUS OF NAZARETH.are symbolical of the three-fold powers of creation.Jesus ascends to Paradise. RESULT. About the middle of the present century, the followers of these three religionswere reckoned as follows: ** OF CHRISTNA.Brahmans, 60,000,000. OF BUDDHA.Buddhists, 450,000,000. OF JESUS.Christians, 260,000,000. Such is the present aspect of these three great religions, of which each is inturn reflected in its successor. Had the Christian dogmatizers stopped there,the results would not have been so disastrous, for it would be hard, indeed, tomake a bad creed out of the lofty teachings of Gautama, or Christna, asBhagaved. But they went farther, and added to pure primitive Christianity thefables of Hercules, Orpheus, and Bacchus. As Mussulmans will not admit thattheir Koran is built on the substratum of the Jewish Bible, so the Christianswill not confess that they owe next to everything to the Hindu religions. Butthe Hindus have chronology to prove it to them. We see the best and most learnedof our writers uselessly striving to show that the extraordinarysimilarities--amounting to identity--between Christna and Christ are due to thespurious Gospels of the Infancy and of St. Thomas having \"probably circulated onthe coast of Malabar, and giving color to the story of Christna.\" *** Why notaccept truth in all sincerity, and reversing matters, admit that St. Thomas,faithful to that policy of proselytism which marked the earliest Christians,when he found in Malabar the original of the mythical Christ in Christna, triedto blend the two; and, adopting in his gospel (from which all others werecopied) the most important details of the story of the Hindu Avatar, engraftedthe Christian heresy on the primitive religion of Christna. For any oneacquainted with the spirit of Brahmanism, the idea of Brahmans acceptinganything from a stranger, especially from a foreigner, is simply ridiculous.That they, the most fanatic people in religious matters, who, during centuries,cannot be compelled to adopt the most simple of European usages, should besuspected of having introduced into their sacred books unverified legends abouta foreign God, is something so preposterously illogical, that it is really wasteof time to contradict the idea! We will not stop to examine the too well-known resemblances between the externalform of Buddhistic worship--especially Lamaism--and Roman Catholicism, fornoticing which poor Huc paid dear--but proceed to compare the most vital points.Of all the original manuscripts that have been translated from the variouslanguages in which Buddhism is expounded, the most extraordinary and interestingare Buddha's Dhammapada, or Path of Virtue, translated from the Pali by ColonelRogers, * and the Wheel of the Law, containing the views of a Siamese Ministerof State on his own and other religions, and translated by Henry Alabaster. **The reading of these two books, and the discovery in them of similarities ofthought and doctrine often amounting to identity, prompted Dr. Inman to writethe many profoundly true passages embodied in one of his last works, AncientFaith and Modern. *** \"I speak with sober earnestness,\" writes thiskind-hearted, sincere scholar, \"when I say that after forty years' experienceamong those who profess Christianity, and those who proclaim . . . more or lessquietly their disagreement with it, I have noticed more sterling virtue andmorality amongst the last than the first. . . . I know personally many pious,good Christian people, whom I honor, admire, and, perhaps, would be glad toemulate or to equal; but they deserve the eulogy thus passed on them, inconsequence of their good sense, having ignored the doctrine of faith to a greatdegree, and having cultivated the practice of good works. . . . In my judgmentthe most praiseworthy Christians whom I know are modified Buddhists, thoughprobably, not one of them ever heard of Siddartha.\" **** Between the Lamaico-Buddhistic and Roman Catholic articles of faith andceremonies, there are fifty-one points presenting a perfect and strikingsimilarity; and four diametrically antagonistic. As it would be useless to enumerate the \"similarities,\" for the reader may findthem carefully noted in Inman's work on Ancient Faith and Modern, pp. 237-240,we will quote but the four dissimilarities, and leave every one to draw his owndeductions therefrom: 1. \"The Buddhists hold that nothing which is contradicted by sound reason can bea true doctrine of Buddha.\" 1. \"The Christians will accept any non-sense, if promulgated by the Church as amatter of faith.\" ***** 2. \"The Buddhists do not adore the mother of Sakya,\" though they honor her as aholy and saint-like woman, chosen to be his mother through her great virtue.3. \"The Buddhists have no sacraments.\"4. The Buddhists do not believe in any pardon for their sins, except after anadequate punishment for each evil deed, and a proportionate compensation to theparties injured. 2. \"The Romanists adore the mother of Jesus, and prayer is made to her for aidand intercession.\" The worship of the Virgin has weakened that of Christ andthrown entirely into the shadow that of the Almighty.3. \"The papal followers have seven.\"4. The Christians are promised that if they only believe in the \"precious bloodof Christ,\" this blood offered by Him for the expiation of the sins of the wholeof mankind (read Christians) will atone for every mortal sin. Which of these theologies most commends itself to the sincere inquirer, is aquestion that may safely be left to the sound judgment of the reader. One offerslight, the other darkness. The Wheel of the Law has the following: \"Buddhists believe that every act, word, or thought has its consequence, whichwill appear sooner or later in the present or in the future state. Evil actswill produce evil consequences, * good acts will produce good consequences:prosperity in this world, or birth in heaven . . . in some future state.\" ** This is strict and impartial justice. This is the idea of a Supreme Power whichcannot fail, and therefore, can have neither wrath nor mercy, but leaves everycause, great or small, to work out its inevitable effects. \"With what measureyou mete, it shall be measured to you again\" ***neither by expression norimplication points to any hope of future mercy or salvation by proxy. Crueltyand mercy are finite feelings. The Supreme Deity is infinite, hence it can onlybe JUST, and Justice must be blind. The ancient Pagans held on this question farmore philosophical views than modern Christians, for they represented theirThemis blindfold. And the Siamese author of the work under notice, has again amore reverent conception of the Deity than the Christians have, when he thusgives vent to his thought: \"A Buddhist might believe in the existence of a God,sublime above all human qualities and attributes--a perfect God, above love, andhatred, and jealousy, calmly resting in a quiet happiness that nothing coulddisturb; and of such a God he would speak no disparagement, not from a desire toplease Him, or fear to offend Him, but from natural veneration. But he cannotunderstand a God with the attributes and qualities of men, a God who loves andhates, and shows anger; a Deity, who, whether described to him by Christianmissionaries, or by Mahometans, or Brahmans, or Jews, falls below his standardof even an ordinary good man.\" * We have often wondered at the extraordinary ideas of God and His justice thatseem to be honestly held by those Christians who blindly rely upon the clergyfor their religion, and never upon their own reason. How strangely illogical isthis doctrine of the Atonement. We propose to discuss it with the Christiansfrom the Buddhistic stand-point, and show at once by what a series ofsophistries, directed toward the one object of tightening the ecclesiasticalyoke upon the popular neck, its acceptance as a divine command has been finallyeffected; also, that it has proved one of the most pernicious and demoralizingof doctrines. The clergy say: no matter how enormous our crimes against the laws of God and ofman, we have but to believe in the self-sacrifice of Jesus for the salvation ofmankind, and His blood will wash out every stain. God's mercy is boundless andunfathomable. It is impossible to conceive of a human sin so damnable that theprice paid in advance for the redemption of the sinner would not wipe it out ifa thousandfold worse. And, furthermore, it is never too late to repent. Thoughthe offender wait until the last minute of the last hour of the last day of hismortal life, before his blanched lips utter the confession of faith, he may goto Paradise; the dying thief did it, and so may all others as vile. These arethe assumptions of the Church. But if we step outside the little circle of creed and consider the universe as awhole balanced by the exquisite adjustment of parts, how all sound logic, howthe faintest glimmering sense of Justice revolts against this VicariousAtonement! If the criminal sinned only against himself, and wronged no one buthimself; if by sincere repentance he could cause the obliteration of pastevents, not only from the memory of man, but also from that imperishable record,which no deity--not even the Supremest of the Supreme--can cause to disappear,then this dogma might not be incomprehensible. But to maintain that one maywrong his fellow-man, kill, disturb the equilibrium of society, and the naturalorder of things, and then--through cowardice, hope, or compulsion, mattersnot--be forgiven by believing that the spilling of one blood washes out theother blood spirt--this is preposterous! Can the results of a crime beobliterated even though the crime itself should be pardoned? The effects of acause are never limited to the boundaries of the cause, nor can the results ofcrime be confined to the offender and his victim. Every good as well as evilaction has its effects, as palpably as the stone flung into a calm water. Thesimile is trite, but it is the best ever conceived, so let us use it. Theeddying circles are greater and swifter, as the disturbing object is greater orsmaller, but the smallest pebble, nay, the tiniest speck, makes its ripples. Andthis disturbance is not alone visible and on the surface. Below, unseen, inevery direction--outward and downward--drop pushes drop until the sides andbottom are touched by the force. More, the air, above the water is agitated, andthis disturbance passes, as the physicists tell us, from stratum to stratum outinto space forever and ever; an impulse has been given to matter, and that isnever lost, can never be recalled! . . . So with crime, and so with its opposite. The action may be instantaneous, theeffects are eternal. When, after the stone is once flung into the pond, we canrecall it to the hand, roll back the ripples, obliterate the force expended,restore the etheric waves to their previous state of non-being, and wipe outevery trace of the act of throwing the missile, so that Time's record shall notshow that it ever happened, then, then we may patiently hear Christians arguefor the efficacy of this Atonement. The Chicago Times recently printed the hangman's record of the first half of thepresent year (1877)--a long and ghastly record of murders and hangings. Nearlyevery one of these murderers received religious consolation, and many announcedthat they had received God's forgiveness through the blood of Jesus, and weregoing that day to Heaven! Their conversion was effected in prison. See how thisledger-balance of Christian justice (!) stands: These red-handed murderers,urged on by the demons of lust, revenge, cupidity, fanaticism, or mere brutalthirst for blood, slew their victims, in most cases, without giving them time torepent, or call on Jesus to wash them clean with his blood. They, perhaps, diedsinful, and, of course,--consistently with theological logic--met the reward oftheir greater or lesser offenses. But the murderer, overtaken by human justice,is imprisoned, wept over by sentimentalists, prayed with and at, pronounces thecharmed words of conversion, and goes to the scaffold a redeemed child of Jesus!Except for the murder, he would not have been prayed with, redeemed, pardoned.Clearly this man did well to murder, for thus he gained eternal happiness? Andhow about the victim, and his or her family, relatives, dependants, socialrelations--has justice no recompense for them? Must they suffer in this worldand the next, while he who wronged them sits beside the \"holy thief\" of Calvaryand is forever blessed? On this question the clergy keep a prudent silence. Steve Anderson was one of these American criminals--convicted of double murder,arson, and robbery. Before the hour of his death he was \"converted,\" but, therecord tells us that \"his clerical attendants objected to his reprieve, on theground that they felt sure of his salvation should he die then, but could notanswer for it if his execution was postponed.\" We address these ministers, andask them to tell us on what grounds they felt sure of such a monstrous thing.How they could feel sure, with the dark future before them, and the endlessresults of this double murder, arson, and robbery? They could be sure ofnothing, but that their abominable doctrine is the cause of three-fourths of thecrimes of so-called Christians; that these terrific causes must produce likemonstrous effects, which in their turn will beget other results, and so roll onthroughout eternity to an accomplishment that no man can calculate. Or take another crime, one of the most selfish, cruel, and heartless, and yetthe most frequent, the seduction of a young girl. Society, by an instinct ofself-preservation, pitilessly judges the victim, and ostracizes her. She may bedriven to infanticide, or self-murder, or if too averse to die, live to plungeinto a career of vice and crime. She may become the mother of criminals, who, asin the now celebrated Jukes, of whose appalling details Mr. Dugdale haspublished the particulars, breed other generations of felons to the number ofhundreds, in fifty or sixty years. All this social disaster came through oneman's selfish passion; shall he be forgiven by Divine Justice until his offenseis expiated, and punishment fall only upon the wretched human scorpions begottenof his lust? An outcry has just been made in England over the discovery that Anglican priestsare largely introducing auricular confession and granting absolution afterenforcing penances. Inquiry shows the same thing prevailing more or less in theUnited States. Put to the ordeal of cross-examination, the clergy quotetriumphantly from the English Book of Common Prayer the rubrics which clearlygive them the absolving authority, through the power of \"God, the Holy Ghost,\"committed unto them by the bishop by imposition of hands at their ordination.The bishop, questioned, points to Matthew xvi., 19, for the source of hisauthority to bind and loose on earth those who are to be blessed or damned inheaven; and to the apostolic succession for proof of its transmission from SimonBarjona to himself. The present volumes have been written to small purpose ifthey have not shown, 1, that Jesus, the Christ-God, is a myth concocted twocenturies after the real Hebrew Jesus died; 2, that, therefore, he never had anyauthority to give Peter, or any one else, plenary power; 3, that even if he hadgiven such authority, the word Petra (rock) referred to the revealed truths ofthe Petroma, not to him who thrice denied him; and that besides, the apostolicsuccesson is a gross and palpable fraud; 4, that the Gospel according to Matthewis a fabrication based upon a wholly different manuscript. The whole thing,therefore, is an imposition alike upon priest and penitent. But putting allthese points aside for the moment, it suffices to ask these pretended agents ofthe three gods of the Trinity, how they reconcile it with the most rudimentalnotions of equity, that if the power to pardon sinners for sinning has beengiven them, they did not also receive the ability by miracle to obliterate thewrongs done against person or property. Let them restore life to the murdered;honor to the dishonored; property to those who have been wronged, and force thescales of human and divine justice to recover their equilibrium. Then we maytalk of their divine commission to bind and loose. Let them say, if they can dothis. Hitherto the world has received nothing but sophistry--believed on blindfaith; we ask palpable, tangible evidence of their God's justice and mercy. Butall are silent; no answer, no reply, and still the inexorable unerring Law ofCompensation proceeds on its unswerving path. If we but watch its progress, wewill find that it ignores all creeds, shows no preferences, but its sunlight andits thunderbolts fall alike on heathen and Christian. No absolution can shieldthe latter when guilty, no anathema hurt the former when innocent. Away from us such an insulting conception of divine justice as that preached bypriests on their own authority. It is fit only for cowards and criminals! Ifthey are backed by a whole array of Fathers and Churchmen, we are supported bythe greatest of all authorities, an instinctive and reverential sense of theeverlasting and everpresent law of harmony and justice. But, besides that of reason, we have other evidence to show that such aconstruction is wholly unwarranted. The Gospels being \"Divine revelation,\"doubtless Christians will regard their testimony as conclusive. Do they affirmthat Jesus gave himself as a voluntary sacrifice? On the contrary, there is nota word to sustain the idea. They make it clear that he would rather have livedto continue what he considered his mission, and that he died because he couldnot help it, and only when betrayed. Before, when threatened with violence, hehad made himself invisible by employing the mesmeric power over the bystanders,claimed by every Eastern adept, and escaped. When, finally, he saw that his timehad come, he succumbed to the inevitable. But see him in the garden, on theMount of Olives, writhing in agony until \"his sweat was, as it were, great dropsof blood,\" praying with fervid supplication that the cup might be removed fromhim; exhausted by his struggle to such a degree that an angel from heaven had tocome and strengthen him; and say if the picture is that of a self-immolatinghostage and martyr. To crown all, and leave no lingering doubt in our minds, wehave his own despairing words, \"NOT MY WILL, but thine, be done!\" (Luke xxii.42. 43.) Again, in the Puranas it may be found that Christna was nailed to a tree by thearrow of a hunter, who, begging the dying god to forgive him, receives thefollowing answer: \"Go, hunter, through my favor, to Heaven, the abode of thegods. . . . Then the illustrious Christna, having united himself with his ownpure, spiritual, inexhaustible, inconceivable, unborn, undecaying, imperishable,and universal Spirit, which is one with Vasudeva, abandoned his mortal body, and. . . he became Nirguna\" (Wilson's Vishnu Purana, p. 612). Is not this theoriginal of the story of Christ forgiving the thief on the cross, and promisinghim a place in Heaven? Such examples \"challenge inquiry as to their origin andmeaning so long anterior to Christianity,\" says Dr. Lundy in MonumentalChristianity, and yet to all this he adds: \"The idea of Krishna as a shepherd, Itake to be older than either (the Gospel of Infancy and that of St. John), andprophetic of Christ\" (p. 156). Facts like these, perchance, furnished later a plausible pretext for declaringapocryphal all such works as the Homilies, which proved but too clearly theutter want of any early authority for the doctrine of atonement. The Homiliesclash but little with the Gospels; they disagree entirely with the dogmas of theChurch. Peter knew nothing of the atonement; and his reverence for the mythicalfather Adam would never have allowed him to admit that this patriarch had sinnedand was accursed. Neither do the Alexandrian theological schools appear to havebeen cognizant of this doctrine, nor Tertullian; nor was it discussed by any ofthe earlier Fathers. Philo represents the story of the Fall as symbolical, andOrigen regarded it the same way as Paul, as an allegory. * Whether they will or not, the Christians have to credit the foolish story ofEve's temptation by a serpent. Besides, Augustine has formally pronounced uponthe subject. \"God, by His arbitrary will,\" he says, \"has selected beforehandcertain persons, without regard to foreseen faith or good actions, and hasirretrievably ordained to bestow upon them eternal happiness; while He hascondemned others in the same way to eternal reprobation\"!! (De donoperseverantae). ** Calvin promulgated views of Divine partiality andbloodthirstiness equally abhorrent. \"The human race, corrupted radically in thefall with Adam, has upon it the guilt and impotence of original sin; itsredemption can be achieved only through an incarnation and a propitiation; ofthis redemption only electing grace can make the soul a participant, and suchgrace, once given, is never lost; this election can come only from God, and itincludes only a part of the race, the rest being left to perdition; election andperdition (the horribile decretum) are both predestinated in the Divine plan;that plan is a decree, and this decree is eternal and unchangeable . . .justification is by faith alone, and faith is the gift of God.\" O Divine Justice, how blasphemed has been thy name! Unfortunately for all suchspeculations, belief in the propitiatory efficacy of blood can be traced to theoldest rites. Hardly a nation remained ignorant of it. Every people offeredanimal and even human sacrifices to the gods, in the hope of averting therebypublic calamity, by pacifying the wrath of some avenging deity. There areinstances of Greek and Roman generals offering their lives simply for thesuccess of their army. Caesar complains of it, and calls it a superstition ofthe Gauls. \"They devote themselves to death . . . believing that unless life isrendered for life the immortal gods cannot be appeased,\" he writes. \"If any evilis about to befall either those who now sacrifice, or Egypt, may it be avertedon this head,\" was pronounced by the Egyptian priests when sacrificing one oftheir sacred animals. And imprecations were uttered over the head of theexpiatory victim, around whose horns a piece of byblus was rolled. * The animalwas generally led to some barren region, sacred to Typhon, in those primitiveages when this fatal deity was yet held in a certain consideration by theEgyptians. It is in this custom that lies the origin of the \"scape-goat\" of theJews, who, when the rufous ass-god was rejected by the Egyptians, begansacrificing to another deity the \"red heifer.\" \"Let all sins that have been committed in this world fall on me that the worldmay be delivered,\" exclaimed Gautama, the Hindu Saviour, centuries before ourera. No one will pretend to assert in our own age that it was the Egyptians whoborrowed anything from the Israelites, as they now accuse the Hindus of doing.Bunsen, Lepsius, Champollion, have long since established the precedence ofEgypt over the Israelites in age as well as in all the religious rites that wenow recognize among the \"chosen people.\" Even the New Testament teems withquotations and repetitions from the Book of the Dead, and Jesus, if everythingattributed to him by his four biographers is true--must have been acquaintedwith the Egyptian Funereal Hymns. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu110.htm#fn_1064] In the Gospel accordingto Matthew we find whole sentences from the ancient and sacred Ritual whichpreceded our era by more than 4,000 years. We will again compare. ** The \"soul\" under trial is brought before Osiris, the \"Lord of Truth,\" who sitsdecorated with the Egyptian cross, emblem of eternal life, and holding in hisright hand the Vannus or the flagellum of justice. *** The spirit begins, in the\"Hall of the Two Truths,\" an earnest appeal, and enumerates its good deeds,supported by the responses of the forty-two assessors--its incarnated deeds andaccusers. If justified, it is addressed as Osiris, thus assuming the appellationof the Deity whence its divine essence proceeded, and the following words, fullof majesty and justice, are pronounced! \"Let the Osiris go; ye see he is withoutfault. . . . He lived on truth, he has fed on truth. . . . The god has welcomedhim as he desired. He has given food to my hungry, drink to my thirsty ones,clothes to my naked. . . . He has made the sacred food of the gods the meat ofthe spirits.\" In the parable of the Kingdom of Heaven (Matthew xxv.), the Son of Man (Osirisis also called the Son) sits upon the throne of his glory, judging the nations,and says to the justified, \"Come ye blessed of my Father (the God) inherit thekingdom. . . . For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty and yegave me drink . . . naked and ye clothed me.\" * To complete the resemblance(Matthew iii. 12): John is made to describe Christ as Osiris, \"whose fan (winnowor vannus) is in his hand, and who will \"purge his floor and gather his wheatinto the garner.\" The same in relation to Buddhist legends. In Matthew iv. 19, Jesus is made tosay: \"Follow me and I will make you fishers of men,\" the whole adapted to aconversation between him and Simon Peter and Andrew his brother. In Schmidt's \"Der Weise und der Thor,\" ** a work full of anecdotes about Buddhaand his disciples, the whole from original texts, it is said of a new convert tothe faith, that \"he had been caught by the hook of the doctrine, just as a fish,who has caught at the bait and line is securely pulled out.\" In the temples ofSiam the image of the expected Buddha, the Messiah Maitree, is represented witha fisherman's net in the hand, while in Thibet he holds a kind of a trap. Theexplanation of it reads as follows: \"He (Buddha) disseminates upon the Ocean ofbirth and decay the Lotus-flower of the excellent law as a bait; with the loopof devotion, never cast out in vain, he brings living beings up like fishes, andcarries them to the other side of the river, where there is trueunderstanding.\" *** Had the erudite Archbishop Cave, Grabe, and Dr. Parker, who so zealouslycontended in their time for the admission of the Epistles of Jesus Christ andAbgarus, King of Edessa, into the Canon of the Scripture, lived in our days ofMax Muller and Sanscrit scholarship, we doubt whether they would have acted asthey did. The first mention of these Epistles ever made, was by the famousEusebius. This pious bishop seems to have been self-appointed to furnishChristianity with the most unexpected proofs to corroborate its wildest fancies.Whether among the many accomplishments of the Bishop of Caesarea, we mustinclude a knowledge of the Cingalese, Pehlevi, Thibetan, and other languages, weknow not; but he surely transcribed the letters of Jesus and Abgarus, and thestory of the miraculous portrait of Christ taken on a piece of cloth, by thesimple wiping of his face, from the Buddhistical Canon. To be sure, the bishopdeclared that he found the letter himself written in Syriac, preserved among theregisters and records of the city of Edessa, where Abgarus reigned. * We recallthe words of Babrias: \"Myth, O son of King Alexander, is an ancient humaninvention of Syrians, who lived in old time under Ninus and Belus.\" Edessa wasone of the ancient \"holy cities.\" The Arabs venerate it to this day; and thepurest Arabic is there spoken. They call it still by its ancient name Orfa, oncethe city Arpha-Kasda (Arphaxad) the seat of a College of Chaldeans and Magi;whose missionary, called Orpheus, brought thence the Bacchic Mysteries toThrace. Very naturally, Eusebius found there the tales which he wrought overinto the story of Abgarus, and the sacred picture taken on a cloth; as that ofBhagavat, or the blessed Tathagata (Buddha) ** was obtained by KingBinsbisara. *** The King having brought it, Bhagavat projected his shadow onit. **** This bit of \"miraculous stuff,\" with its shadow, is still preserved,say the Buddhists; \"only the shadow itself is rarely seen.\" In like manner, the Gnostic author of the Gospel according to John, copied andmetamorphosed the legend of Ananda who asked drink of a Matangha woman--theantitype of the woman met by Jesus at the well, *****and was reminded by herthat she belongs to a low caste, and may have nothing to do with a holy monk. \"Ido not ask thee, my sister,\" answers Ananda to the woman, \"either thy caste orthy family, I only ask thee for water, if thou canst give me some.\" ThisMatangha woman, charmed and moved to tears, repents, joins the monastic Order ofGautama, and becomes a saint, rescued from a life of unchastity by Sakya-muni.Many of her subsequent actions were used by Christian forgers, to endow MaryMagdalen and other female saints and martyrs. \"And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of coldwater only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wiselose his reward,\" says the Gospel (Matthew x. 42). \"Whosoever, with a purelybelieving heart, offers nothing but a handful of water, or presents so much tothe spiritual assembly, or gives drink therewith to the poor and needy, or to abeast of the field; this meritorious action will not be exhausted in manyages,\" * says the Buddhist Canon. At the hour of Gautama-Buddha's birth there were 32,000 wonders performed. Theclouds stopped immovable in the sky, the waters of the rivers ceased to flow;the flowers ceased unbudding; the birds remained silent and full of wonder; allnature remained suspended in her course, and was full of expectation. \"There wasa preternatural light spread all over the world; animals suspended their eating;the blind saw; and the lame and dumb were cured,\" etc. * We now quote from the Protevangelion: \"At the hour of the Nativity, as Joseph looked up into the air, 'I saw,' hesays, 'the clouds astonished, and the fowls of the air stopping in the midst oftheir flight. . . . And I beheld the sheep dispersed . . . and yet the sheepstood still; and I looked into a river, and saw the kids with their mouths closeto the water, and touching it, but they did not drink. \"Then a bright cloud overshadowed the cave. But on a sudden the cloud became agreat light in the cave, so that their eyes could not bear it. . . . The hand ofSalome, which was withered, was straightway cured. . . . The blind saw; the lameand dumb were cured.\" ** When sent to school, the young Gautama, without having ever studied, completelyworsted all his competitors; not only in writing, but in arithmetic,mathematics, metaphysics, wrestling, archery, astronomy, geometry, and finallyvanquishes his own professors by giving the definition of sixty-four kinds ofwritings, which were unknown to the masters themselves. *** And this is what is said again in the Gospel of the Infancy: \"And when he(Jesus) was twelve years old . . . a certain principal Rabbi asked him, 'Hastthou read books?' and a certain astronomer asked the Lord Jesus whether he hadstudied astronomy. And Lord Jesus explained to him . . . about the spheres . . .about the physics and metaphysics. Also things that reason of man had neverdiscovered. . . . The constitutions of the body, how the soul operated upon thebody, . . . etc. And at this the master was so surprised that he said: 'Ibelieve this boy was born before Noah . . . he is more learned than any master.'\" **** The precepts of Hillel, who died forty years B. C., appear rather as quotationsthan original expressions in the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus taught the worldnothing that had not been taught as earnestly before by other masters. He beginshis sermon with certain purely Buddhistic precepts that had found acceptanceamong the Essenes, and were generally practiced by the Orphikoi, and theNeo-platonists. There were the Philhellenes, who, like Apollonius, had devotedtheir lives to moral and physical purity, and who practiced asceticism. He triesto imbue the hearts of his audience with a scorn for worldly wealth; afakir-like unconcern for the morrow; love for humanity, poverty, and chastity.He blesses the poor in spirit, the meek, the hungering and the thirsting afterrighteousness, the merciful and the peace-makers, and, Buddha-like, leaves but apoor chance for the proud castes to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Every wordof his sermon is an echo of the essential principles of monastic Buddhism. Theten commandments of Buddha, as found in an appendix to the Pratimoksha Sutra(Pali-Burman text), are elaborated to their full extent in Matthew. If we desireto acquaint ourselves with the historical Jesus we have to set the mythicalChrist entirely aside, and learn all we can of the man in the first Gospel. Hisdoctrines, religious views, and grandest aspirations will be found concentratedin his sermon. This is the principal cause of the failure of missionaries to convertBrahmanists and Buddhists. These see that the little of really good that isoffered in the new religion is paraded only in theory, while their own faithdemands that those identical rules shall be applied in practice. Notwithstandingthe impossibility for Christian missionaries to understand clearly the spirit ofa religion wholly based on that doctrine of emanation which is so inimical totheir own theology, the reasoning powers of some simple Buddhistical preachersare so high, that we see a scholar like Gutzlaff, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu110.htm#fn_1080] utterly silenced and putto great straits by Buddhists. Judson, the famous Baptist missionary in Burmah,confesses, in his Journal, the difficulties to which he was often driven bythem. Speaking of a certain Ooyan, he remarks that his strong mind was capableof grasping the most difficult subjects. \"His words,\" he remarks, \"are as smoothas oil, as sweet as honey, and as sharp as razors; his mode of reasoning issoft, insinuating, and acute; and so adroitly does he act his part, that I withthe strength of truth, was scarcely able to keep him down.\" It appears though,that at a later period of his mission, Mr. Judson found that he had utterlymistaken the doctrine. \"I begin to find,\" he says, \"that the semi-atheism, whichI had sometimes mentioned, is nothing but a refined Buddhism, having itsfoundation in the Buddhistic Scriptures.\" Thus he discovered at last that whilethere is in Buddhism \"a generic term of most exalted perfection actually appliedto numerous individuals, a Buddha superior to the whole host of subordinatedeities,\" there are also lurking in the system \"the glimmerings of an animamundi anterior to, and even superior to, Buddha.\" * This is a happy discovery, indeed! Even the so-slandered Chinese believe in One, Highest God. \"The Supreme Ruler ofHeavens.\" Yuh-Hwang-Shang-ti, has his name inscribed only on the golden tabletbefore the altar of heaven at the great temple at Pekin, T'Iantan. \"Thisworship,\" says Colonel Yule, \"is mentioned by the Mahometan narrator of ShahRukh's embassy (A.D. 1421): 'Every year there are some days on which the emperoreats no animal food. . . . He spends his time in an apartment which contains noidol, and says that he is worshipping the God of Heaven.' \" ** Speaking of Shahrastani, the great Arabian scholar, Chwolsohn says that for himSabaeism was not astrolatry, as many are inclined to think. He thought \"that Godis too sublime and too great to occupy Himself with the immediate management ofthis world; that He has, therefore, transferred the government thereof to thegods, and retained only the most important affairs for Himself; that further,man is too weak to be able to apply immediately to the Highest; that he must,therefore, address his prayers and sacrifices to the intermediate divinities, towhom the management of the world has been entrusted by the Highest.\" Chwolsohnargues that this idea is as old as the world, and that \"in the heathen worldthis view was universally shared by the cultivated.\" *** Father Boori, a Portuguese missionary, who was sent to convert the \"poorheathen\" of Cochin-China, as early as the sixteenth century, \"protests indespair, in his narrative, that there is not a dress, office, or ceremony in theChurch of Rome, to which the Devil has not here provided some counterpart. Evenwhen the Father began inveighing against the idols, he was answered that thesewere the images of departed great men, whom they worshipped exactly on the sameprinciple, and in the same manner, as the Catholics did the images of theapostles and martyrs.\" ****Moreover, these idols have importance but in the eyesof the ignorant multitudes. The philosophy of Buddhism ignores images andfetishes. Its strongest vitality lies in its psychological conceptions of man'sinner self. The road to the supreme state of felicity, called the Ford ofNirvana, winds its invisible paths through the spiritual, not physical life of aperson while on this earth. The sacred Buddhistical literature points the way bystimulating man to follow practically the example of Gautama. Therefore, the Buddhistical writings lay a particular stress on the spiritualprivileges of man, advising him to cultivate his powers for the production ofMeipo (phenomena) during life, and for the attainment of Nirvana in thehereafter. But turning again from the historical to the mythical narratives, invented alikeabout Christna, Buddha, and Christ, we find the following: Setting a model for the Christian avatar and the archangel Gabriel to follow,the luminous San-tusita (Bodhisat) appeared to Maha-maya 'like a cloud in themoonlight, coming from the north, and in his hand holding a white lotus.' Heannounced to her the birth of her son, and circumambulating the queen's couchthrice . . . passed away from the dewa-loka and was conceived in the world ofmen. * The resemblance will be found still more perfect upon examining theillustrations in mediaeval psalters, ** and the panel-paintings of the sixteenthcentury (in the Church of Jouy, for instance, in which the Virgin is representedkneeling, with her hands uplifted toward the Holy Ghost, and the unborn child ismiraculously seen through her body), and then finding the same subject treatedin the identical way in the sculptures in certain convents in Thibet. In thePali-Buddhistic annals, and other religious records, it is stated that Maha-deviand all her attendants were constantly \"gatified with the sight of the infantBodhisatva quietly developing within his mother's bosom, and beaming already,from his place of gestation, upon humanity \"the resplendent moonshine of hisfuture benevolence.\" *** Ananda, the cousin and future disciple of Sakya-muni, is represented as havingbeen born at the same time. He appears to have been the original for the oldlegends about John the Baptist. For example, the Pali narrative relates thatMaha-maya, while pregnant with the sage, paid a visit to his mother, as Mary didto the mother of the Baptist. Immediately, as she entered the apartment, theunborn Ananda greeted the unborn Buddha-Siddhartha, who also returned thesalutation; and in like manner the babe, afterward John the Baptist, leaped inthe womb of Elizabeth when Mary came in. **** More even that that; for Didrondescribes a scene of salutation, painted on shutters at Lyons, between Elizabethand Mary, in which the two unborn infants, both pictured as outside theirmothers, are also saluting each other. ***** If we turn now to Christna and attentively compare the prophecies respectinghim, as collected in the Ramatsariarian traditions of the Atharva, the Vedangas,and the Vedantas, * with passages in the Bible and apocryphal Gospels, of whichit is pretended that some presage the coming of Christ, we shall find verycurious facts. Following are examples: FROM THE HINDU BOOKS. 1st. \"He (the Redeemer) shall come, crowned with lights, the pure fluid issuingfrom the great soul . . . dispersing darkness\" (Atharva). 2d. \"In the early part of the Kali-Yuga shall be born the son of the Virgin\"(Vedanta). 3d. \"The Redeemer shall come, and the accursed Rakhasas shall fly for refuge tothe deepest hell\" (Atharva). 4th. \"He shall come, and life will defy death . . . and he shall revivify theblood of all beings, shall regenerate all bodies, and purify all souls.\" 5th. \"He shall come, and all animated beings, all the flowers, plants, men,women, the infants, the slaves . . . shall together intone the chant of joy, forhe is the Lord of all creatures . . . he is infinite, for he is power, for he iswisdom, for he is beauty, for he is all and in all.\" 6th. \"He shall come, more sweet than honey and ambrosia, more pure than the lambwithout spot\" (Ibid.). 7th. \"Happy the blest womb that shall bear him\" (Ibid.). 8th. \"And God shall manifest His glory, and make His power resound, and shallreconcile Himself with His creatures\" (Ibid.). 9th. \"It is in the bosom of a woman that the ray of the Divine splendor willreceive human form, and she shall bring forth, being a virgin, for no impurecontact shall have defiled her\" (Vedangas). FROM THE CHRISTIAN BOOKS. 1st. \"The people of Galilee of the Gentiles which sat in darkness saw greatlight\" (Matthew iv. from Isaiah ix. 1, 2). 2d. \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son\" (Isaiah vii. quoted inMatthew i. 23). 3d. \"Behold, now, Jesus of Nazareth, with the brightness of his gloriousdivinity, put to flight all the horrid powers of darkness\" (Nicodemus). 4th. \"And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish\" (John x.28). 5th. \"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! shout, O daughter of Jerusalem!behold, thy King cometh unto thee . . . he is just . . . for how great is hisgoodness, and how great is his beauty! Corn shall make the young men cheerful,and new wine the maids\" (Zechariah ix.). 6th. \"Behold the lamb of God\" (John i. 36). \"He was brought as a lamb to theslaughter\" (Isaiah 53). 7th. \"Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb\" (Lukei.); \"Blessed is the womb that bare thee\" (xi. 27). 8th. \"God manifested forth His glory\" (John, 1st Ep.). \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself\" (2 Corinth. v.). 9th. \"Being an unparalleled instance, without any pollution or defilement, and avirgin shall bring forth a son, and a maid shall bring forth the Lord\" (Gospelof Mary, iii.). Let there be exaggeration or not in attributing to the Atharva-Veda and theother books such a great antiquity, the fact remains that these prophecies andtheir realization preceded Christianity, and Christna preceded Christ. That isall we need care to inquire. One is completely overwhelmed with astonishment upon reading Dr. Lundy'sMonumental Christianity. It would be difficult to say whether an admiration forthe author's erudition, or amazement at his serene and unparalleled sophistry isstronger. He has gathered a world of facts which prove that the religions, farmore ancient than Christianity, of Christna, Buddha, and Osiris had anticipatedeven its minutest symbols. His materials come from no forged papyri, nointerpolated Gospels, but from sculptures on the walls of ancient temples, frommonuments, inscriptions, and other archaic relics, only mutilated by the hammersof iconoclasts, the cannon of fanatics, and the effects of time. He shows usChristna and Apollo as good shepherds; Christna holding the cruciform chank andthe chakra, and Christna \"crucified in space,\" as he calls it (MonumentalChristianity, fig. 72). Of this figure--borrowed by Dr. Lundy from Moor's HinduPantheon--it may be truly said that it is calculated to petrify a Christian withastonishment, for it is the crucified Christ of Romish art to the last degree ofresemblance. Not a feature is lacking; and, the author says of it himself: \"Thisrepresentation I believe to be anterior to Christianity. . . . It looks like aChristian crucifix in many respects. . . . The drawing, the attitude, thenail-marks in hands and feet, indicate a Christian origin, while the Parthiancoronet of seven points, the absence of the wood, and of the usual inscription,and the rays of glory above, would seem to point to some other than a Christianorigin. Can it be the victim-man, or the priest and victim both in one, of theHindu Mythology, who offered himself a sacrifice before the worlds were? Can itbe Plato's Second God who impressed himself on the universe in the form of thecross? Or is it his divine man who would be scourged, tormented, fettered; havehis eyes burnt out; and lastly . . . would be crucified?\" (Republic, c. ii., p.52, Spens. Trans.). It is all that and much more; Archaic Religious Philosophywas universal. As it is, Dr. Lundy contradicts Moor, and maintains that this figure is that ofWittoba, one of the avatars of Vishnu, hence Christna, and anterior toChristianity, which is a fact not very easily to be put down. And yet althoughhe finds it prophetic of Christianity, he thinks it has no relation whatever toChrist! His only reason is that \"in a Christian crucifix the glory always comesfrom the sacred head; here it is from above and beyond. . . . The Pundit'sWittoba then, given to Moor, would seem to be the crucified Krishna, theshepherd-god of Mathura. . . a Saviour--the Lord of the Covenant, as well asLord of Heaven and earth--pure and impure, light and dark, good and bad,peaceful and war-like, amiable and wrathful, mild and turbulent, forgiving andvindictive, God and a strange mixture of man, but not the Christ of theGospels.\" Now all these qualities must pertain to Jesus as well as to Christna. The veryfact that Jesus was a man upon the mother's side--even though he were a God,implies as much. His behavior toward the fig-tree, and his self-contradictions,in Matthew, where at one time he promises peace on earth, and at another thesword, etc., are proofs in this direction. Undoubtedly this cut was neverintended to represent Jesus of Nazareth. It was Wittoba, as Moor was told, andas moreover the Hindu Sacred Scriptures state, Brahma, the sacrificer who is \"atonce both sacrificer and victim\"; it is \"Brahma, victim in His Son Christna, whocame to die on earth for our salvation, who Himself accomplishes the solemnsacrifice (of the Sarvameda).\" And yet, it is the man Jesus as well as the manChristna, for both were united to their Chrestos. Thus we have either to admit periodical \"incarnations,\" or let Christianity goas the greatest imposture and plagiarism of the ages! As to the Jewish Scriptures, only such men as the Jesuit de Carriere, aconvenient representative of the majority of the Catholic clergy, can stillcommand their followers to accept only the chronology established by the HolyGhost. It is on the authority of the latter that we learn that Jacob went, witha family of seventy persons, all told, to settle in Egypt in A.M. 2298, and thatin A.M. 2513--just 215 years afterward--these seventy persons had so increasedthat they left Egypt 600,000 fighting men strong, \"without counting women andchildren,\" which, according to the science of statistics, should represent atotal population of between two and three millions!! Natural history affords noparallel to such fecundity, except in red herrings. After this let the Christianmissionaries laugh, if they can, at Hindu chronology and computations. \"Happy are those persons, but not to be envied,\" exclaims Bunsen, \"who have nomisgivings about making Moses march out with more than two millions of people atthe end of a popular conspiracy and rising, in the sunny days of the eighteenthdynasty; who make the Israelites conquer Kanaan under Joshua, during andprevious to the most formidable campaigns of conquering Pharaohs in that samecountry. The Egyptian and Assyrian annals, combined with the historicalcriticism of the Bible, prove that the exodus could only have taken place underMenephthah, so that Joshua could not have crossed the Jordan before Easter 1280,the last campaign of Ramses III. in Palestine being in 1281.\" * But we must resume the thread of our narrative with Buddha. Neither he nor Jesus ever wrote one word of their doctrines. We have to take theteachings of the masters on the testimony of the disciples, and therefore it isbut fair that we should be allowed to judge both doctrines on their intrinsicvalue. Where the logical preponderance lies, may be seen in the results offrequent encounters between Christian missionaries and Buddhist theologians(pungui). The latter usually, if not invariably, have the better of theiropponents. On the other hand, the \"Lama of Jehovah\" rarely fails to lose histemper, to the great delight of the Lama of Buddha, and practically demonstrateshis religion of patience, mercy, and charity, by abusing his disputant in themost uncanonical language. This we have witnessed repeatedly. Despite the notable similarity of the direct teachings of Gautama and Jesus, weyet find their respective followers starting from two diametrically oppositepoints. The Buddhist divine, following literally the ethical doctrine of hismaster, remains thus true to the legacy of Gautama; while the Christianminister, distorting the precepts recorded by the four Gospels beyondrecognition, teaches, not that which Jesus taught, but the absurd, too oftenpernicious, interpretations of fallible men--Popes, Luthers, and Calvinsincluded. The following are two instances selected from both religions, andbrought into contrast. Let the reader judge for himself: \"Do not believe in anything because it is rumored and spoken of by many,\" saysBuddha; \"do not think that is a proof of its truth. \"Do not believe merely because the written statement of some old sage isproduced; do not be sure that the writing has ever been revised by the saidsage, or can be relied on. Do not believe in what you have fancied, thinkingthat, because an idea is extraordinary, it must have been implanted by a Deva,or some wonderful being. \"Do not believe in guesses, that is, assuming something at hap-hazard as astarting-point, and then drawing conclusions from it--reckoning your two andyour three and your four before you have fixed your number one. \"Do not believe merely on the authority of your teachers and masters, or believeand practice merely because they believe and practice. \"I [Buddha] tell you all, you must of yourselves know that this is evil, this ispunishable, this is censured by wise men; belief in this will bring no advantageto any one, but will cause sorrow; and when you know this, then eschew it.\" * It is impossible to avoid contrasting with these benevolent and humansentiments, the fulminations of the OEcumenical Council and the Pope,against theemployment of reason, and the pursuit of science when it clashes withrevelation. The atrocious Papal benediction of Moslem arms and cursing of theRussian and Bulgarian Christians have roused the indignation of some of the mostdevoted Catholic communities. The Catholic Czechs of Prague on the day of therecent semi-centennial jubilee of Pius IX., and again on the 6th of July, theday sacred to the memory of John Huss, the burned martyr, to mark their horrorof the Ultramontane policy in this respect, gathered by thousands upon theneighboring Mount Zhishko, and with great ceremony and denunciations, burned thePope's portrait, his Syllabus, and last allocution against the Russian Czar,saying that they were good Catholics, but better Slavs. Evidently, the memory ofJohn Huss is more sacred to them than the Vatican Popes. \"The worship of words is more pernicious than the worship of images,\" remarksRobert Dale Owen. \"Grammatolatry is the worst species of idolatry. We havearrived at an era in which literalism is destroying faith. . . . The letterkilleth.\" * There is not a dogma in the Church to which these words can be better appliedthan to the doctrine of transubstantiation. **\"Whoso eateth my flesh anddrinketh my blood hath eternal life,\" Christ is made to say. \"This is a hardsaying,\" repeated his dismayed listeners. The answer was that of an initiate.\"Doth this offend you? It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profitethnothing. The words (remata, or arcane utterances) that I speak unto you, theyare Spirit and they are Life.\" During the Mysteries wine represented Bacchus, and bread Ceres. *** The hierophant-initiator presented symbolically before the final revelation wineand bread to the candidate who had to eat and drink of both in token that thespirit was to quicken matter, i.e., the divine wisdom was to enter into his bodythrough what was to be revealed to him. Jesus, in his Oriental phraseology,constantly assimilated himself to the true vine (John xv. 1). Furthermore, thehierophant, the discloser of the Petroma, was called \"Father.\" When Jesus says,\"Drink . . . this is my blood,\" what else was meant, it was simply ametaphorical assimilation of himself to the vine, which bears the grape, whosejuice is its blood--wine. It was a hint that as he had himself been initiated bythe \"Father,\" so he desired to initiate others. His \"Father\" was the husbandman,himself the vine, his disciples the branches. His followers being ignorant ofthe terminology of the Mysteries, wondered; they even took it as an offense,which is not surprising, considering the Mosaic injunction against blood. There is quite enough in the four gospels to show what was the secret and mostfervent hope of Jesus; the hope in which he began to teach, and in which hedied. In his immense and unselfish love for humanity, he considers it unjust todeprive the many of the results of the knowledge acquired by the few. Thisresult he accordingly preaches--the unity of a spiritual God, whose temple iswithin each of us, and in whom we live as He lives in us--in Spirit. Thisknowledge was in the hands of the Jewish adepts of the school of Hillel and thekabalists. But the \"scribes,\" or lawyers, having gradually merged into thedogmatism of the dead letter, had long since separated themselves from theTanaim, the true spiritual teachers; and the practical kabalists were more orless persecuted by the Synagogue. Hence, we find Jesus exclaiming: \"Woe unto youlawyers! For ye have taken away the key of knowledge [the Gnosis]: ye enterednot in yourselves, and them that were entering ye prevented\" (Luke xi. 52). Themeaning here is clear. They did take the key away, and could not even profit byit themselves, for the Masorah (tradition) had become a closed book tothemselves as well as to others.Neither Renan nor Strauss, nor the more modernViscount Amberley seem to have had the remotest suspicion of the real meaning ofmany of the parables of Jesus, or even of the character of the great Galileanphilosopher. Renan, as we have seen, presented him to us as a Gallicized Rabbi,\"le plus charmant de tous,\" still but a Rabbi; and one, moreover, who does noteven come out of the school of Hillel, or any school either, albeit he terms himrepeatedly \"the charming doctor.\" *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu110.htm#fn_1096] He shows him as asentimental young enthusiast, sprung out of the plebeian classes of Galilee, whoimagines the ideal kings of his parables the empurpled and jewelled beings ofwhom one reads in nursery tales. ** Lord Amberley's Jesus, on the other hand, is an \"iconoclastic idealist,\" farinferior in subtilty and logic to his critics. Renan looks over at Jesus withthe one-sidedness of a Semitomaniac; Viscount Amberley looks down upon him fromthe social plane of an English lord. Apropos of this marriage-feast parable,which he considers as embodying \"a curious theory of social intercourse,\" theViscount says: \"Nobody can object to charitable individuals asking poor peopleor invalids without rank at their houses. . . . But we cannot admit that thiskind action ought to be rendered obligatory . . . it is eminently desirable thatwe should do exactly what Christ would forbid us doing--namely, invite ourneighbors and be invited by them as circumstances may require. The fear that wemay receive a recompense for the dinner-parties we may give, is surelychimerical. . . . Jesus, in fact, overlooks entirely the more intellectual sideof society.\" *** All of which unquestionably shows that the \"Son of God\" was nomaster of social etiquette, nor fit for \"society\"; but it is also a fair exampleof the prevalent misconception of even his most suggestive parables. The theory of Anquetil du Perron that the Bagaved-gita is an independent work,as it is absent from several manuscripts of the Maha-Bharata, may be as much aplea for a still greater antiquity as the reverse. The work is purelymetaphysical and ethical, and in a certain sense it is anti-Vedic; so far, atleast, that it is in opposition with many of the later Brahmanicalinterpretations of the Vedas. How comes it, then, that instead of destroying thework, or, at least, of sentencing it as uncanonical--an expedient to which theChristian Church would never have failed to resort--the Brahmans show it thegreatest reverence? Perfectly unitarian in its aim, it clashes with the popularidol-worship. Still, the only precaution taken by the Brahmans to keep itstenets from becoming too well known, is to preserve it more secretly than anyother religious book from every caste except the sacerdotal; and, to impose uponthat even, in many cases, certain restrictions. The grandest mysteries of theBrahmanical religion are embraced within this magnificent poem; and even theBuddhists recognize it, explaining certain dogmatic difficulties in their ownway. \"Be unselfish, subdue your senses and passions, which obscure reason andlead to deceit,\" says Christna to his disciple Arjuna, thus enunciating a purelyBuddhistic principle. \"Low men follow examples, great men give them. . . . Thesoul ought to free itself from the bonds of action, and act absolutely accordingto its divine origin. There is but one God, and all other devotas are inferior,and mere forms (powers) of Brahma or of myself. Worship by deeds predominatesover that of contemplation.\" * This doctrine coincides perfectly with that of Jesus himself. ** Faith alone,unaccompanied by \"works,\" is reduced to naught in the Bagaved-gita. As to theAtharva-Veda, it was and is preserved in such secrecy by the Brahmans, that itis a matter of doubt whether the Orientalists have a complete copy of it. Onewho has read what Abbe Dubois says may well doubt the fact. \"Of the lastspecies--the Atharva--there are very few,\" he says, writing of the Vedas, \"andmany people suppose they no longer exist. But the truth is, they do exist,though they conceal themselves with more caution than the others, from the fearof being suspected to be initiated in the magic mysteries and other dreadedmysteries which the work is believed to teach.\" *** There were even those among the highest epoptae of the greater Mysteries whoknew nothing of their last and dreaded rite--the voluntary transfer of life fromhierophant to candidate. In Ghost-Land **** this mystical operation of theadept's transfer of his spiritual entity, after the death of his body, into theyouth he loves with all the ardent love of a spiritual parent, is superblydescribed. As in the case of the reincarnation of the lamas of Thibet, an adeptof the highest order may live indefinitely. His mortal casket wears outnotwithstanding certain alchemical secrets for prolonging the youthful vigor farbeyond the usual limits, yet the body can rarely be kept alive beyond ten ortwelve score of years. The old garment is then worn out, and the spiritual Egoforced to leave it, selects for its habitation a new body, fresh and full ofhealthy vital principle. In case the reader should feel inclined to ridiculethis assertion of the possible prolongation of human life, we may as well referhim to the statistics of several countries. The author of an able article in theWestminster Review, for October, 1850, is responsible for the statement that inEngland, they have the authentic instances of one Thomas Jenkins dying at theage of 169, and \"Old Parr\" at 152; and that in Russia some of the peasants are\"known to have reached 242 years.\" * There are also cases of centenarianismreported among the Peruvian Indians. We are aware that many able writers haverecently discredited these claims to an extreme longevity, but we neverthelessaffirm our belief in their truth. True or false there are \"superstitions\" among the Eastern people such as havenever been dreamed even by an Edgar Poe or a Hoffmann. And these beliefs run inthe very blood of the nations with which they originated. Carefully stripped ofexaggeration they will be found to embody an universal belief in those restless,wandering, astral souls, which are called ghouls and vampires. An ArmenianBishop of the fifth century, named Yeznik, gives a number of such narratives ina manuscript work (Book i., §§ 20, 30), preserved some thirty years ago in thelibrary of the Monastery of Etchmeadzine. ** Among others, there is a traditiondating from the days of heathendom, that whenever a hero whose life is neededyet on earth falls on the battle-field, the Aralez, the popular gods of ancientArmenia, empowered to bring back to life those slaughtered in battle, lick thebleeding wounds of the victim, and breathe on them until they have imparted anew and vigorous life. After that the warrior rises, washes off all traces ofhis wounds, and resumes his place in the fray. But his immortal spirit has fled;and for the remainder of his days he lives--a deserted temple. Once that an adept was initiated into the last and most solemn mystery of thelife-transfer, the awful seventh rite of the great sacerdotal operation, whichis the highest theurgy, he belonged no more to this world. His soul was freethereafter, and the seven mortal sins lying in wait to devour his heart, as thesoul, liberated by death, would be crossing the seven halls and sevenstaircases, could hurt him no more alive or dead; he has passed the \"twice seventrials\" the twelve labors of the final hour. *** The High Hierophant alone knew how to perform this solemn operation by infusinghis own vital life and astral soul into the adept, chosen by him for hissuccessor, who thus became endowed with a double life. * \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see thekingdom of God\" (John iii. 3). Jesus tells Nicodemus, \"That which is born of theflesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.\" This allusion, so unintelligible in itself, is explained in the Satapa-Brahmana.It teaches that a man striving after spiritual perfection must have threebirths: 1st. Physical from his mortal parents; 2d. Spiritual, through religioussacrifice (initiation); 3d. His final birth into the world of spirit--at death.Though it may seem strange that we should have to go to the old land of thePunjab and the banks of the sacred Ganges, for an interpreter of words spoken inJerusalem and expounded on the banks of the Jordan, the fact is evident. Thissecond birth, or regeneration of spirit, after the natural birth of that whichis born of the flesh, might have astonished a Jewish ruler. Nevertheless, it hadbeen taught 3,000 years before the appearance of the great Galilean prophet, notonly in old India but to all the epoptae of the Pagan initiation, who wereinstructed in the great mysteries of LIFE and DEATH. This secret of secrets,that soul is not knit to flesh, was practically demonstrated in the instance ofthe Yogis, the followers of Kapila. Having emancipated their souls from thefetters of Prakriti, or Mahat (the physical perception of the senses andmind--in one sense, creation), they so developed their soul-power andwill-force, as to have actually enabled themselves, while on earth, tocommunicate with the supernal worlds, and perform what is bunglingly termed\"miracles.\" ** Men whose astral spirits have attained on earth the nehreyasa, orthe mukti, are half-gods; disembodied spirits, they reach Moksha or Nirvana, andthis is their second spiritual birth. Buddha teaches the doctrine of a new birth as plainly as Jesus does. Desiring tobreak with the ancient Mysteries, to which it was impossible to admit theignorant masses, the Hindu reformer, though generally silent upon more than onesecret dogma, clearly states his thought in several passages. Thus, he says:\"Some people are born again; evil-doers go to Hell; righteous people go toHeaven; those who are free from all worldly desires enter Nirvana\" (Precepts ofthe Dhammapada, v., 126). Elsewhere Buddha states that \"it is better to believein a future life, in which happiness or misery can be felt; for if the heartbelieves therein, it will abandon sin and act virtuously; and even if there isno resurrection, such a life will bring a good name and the regard of men. Butthose who believe in extinction at death will not fail to commit any sin thatthey may choose, because of their disbelief in a future.\" * The Epistle to the Hebrews treats of the sacrifice of blood. \"Where a testamentis,\" says the writer, \"there must be of necessity the death of the testator. . .. Without the shedding of blood is no remission.\" Then again: \"Christ glorifiednot himself to be made High Priest; but He that said unto him: Thou art my son;TO-DAY HAVE I BEGOTTEN THEE\" (Heb. v. 5). This is a very clear inference, that,1, Jesus was considered only in the light of a high priest, likeMelchisedek--another avatar, or incarnation of Christ, according to the Fathers;and, 2, that the writer thought that Jesus had become a \"Son of God\" only at themoment of his initiation by water; hence, that he was not born a god, neitherwas he begotten physically by Him. Every initiate of the \"last hour\" became, bythe very fact of his initiation, a son of God. When Maxime, the Ephesian,initiated the Emperor Julian into the Mithraic Mysteries, he pronounced as theusual formula of the rite, the following: \"By this blood, I wash thee from thysins. The Word of the Highest has entered unto thee, and His Spirit henceforthwill rest upon the NEWLY-BORN, the now-begotten of the Highest God. . . . Thouart the son of Mithra.\" \"Thou art the 'Son of God,' \" repeated the disciplesafter Christ's baptism. When Paul shook off the viper into the fire withoutfurther injury to himself, the people of Melita said \"that he was a god\" (Actsxxviii.). \"He is the son of God, the Beautiful!\" was the term used by thedisciples of Simon Magus, for they thought they recognized the \"great power ofGod\" in him. A man can have no god that is not bounded by his own human conceptions. Thewider the sweep of his spiritual vision, the mightier will be his deity. Butwhere can we find a better demonstration of Him than in man himself; in thespiritual and divine powers lying dormant in every human being? \"The verycapacity to imagine the possibility of thaumaturgical powers, is itself evidencethat they exist,\" says the author of Prophecy. \"The critic, as well as theskeptic, is generally inferior to the person or subject that he is reviewing,and, therefore, is hardly a competent witness. If there are counterfeits,somewhere there must have been a genuine original.\" * Blood begets phantoms, and its emanations furnish certain spirits with thematerials required to fashion their temporary appearances. \"Blood,\" says Levi,\"is the first incarnation of the universal fluid; it is the materialized vitallight. Its birth is the most marvellous of all nature's marvels; it lives onlyby perpetually transforming itself, for it is the universal Proteus. The bloodissues from principles where there was none of it before, and it becomes flesh,bones, hair, nails . . . tears, and perspiration. It can be allied neither tocorruption nor death; when life is gone, it begins decomposing; if you know howto reanimate it, to infuse into it life by a new magnetization of its globules,life will return to it again. The universal substance, with its double motion,is the great arcanum of being; blood is the great arcanum of life.\" \"Blood,\" says the Hindu Ramatsariar, \"contains all the mysterious secrets ofexistence, no living being can exist without. It is profaning the great work ofthe Creator to eat blood.\" In his turn Moses, following the universal and traditional law, forbids eatingblood. Paracelsus writes that with the fumes of blood one is enabled to call forth anyspirit we desire to see; for with its emanations it will build itself anappearance, a visible body--only this is sorcery. The hierophants of Baal madedeep incisions all over their bodies and produced apparitions, objective andtangible, with their own blood. The followers of a certain sect in Persia, manyof whom may be found around the Russian settlements in Temerchan-Shoura, andDerbent, have their religious mysteries in which they form a large ring, andwhirl round in a frantic dance. Their temples are ruined, and they worship inlarge temporary buildings, securely enclosed, and with the earthen floor deeplystrewn with sand. They are all dressed in long white robes, and their heads arebare and closely shaved. Armed with knives, they soon reach a point of furiousexaltation, and wound themselves and others until their garments and the sand onthe floor are soaked with blood. Before the end of the \"Mystery\" every man has acompanion, who whirls round with him. Sometimes the spectral dancers have hairon their heads, which makes them quite distinct from their unconscious creators.As we have solemnly promised never to divulge the principal details of thisterrible ceremony (which we were allowed to witness but once), we must leave thesubject. * In the days of antiquity the sorceresses of Thessaly added sometimes to theblood of a black lamb that of an infant, and by this means evoked the shadows.The priests were taught the art of calling up the spirits of the dead, as wellas those of the elements, but their mode was certainly not that of Thessaliansorceresses. Among the Yakuts of Siberia there is a tribe dwelling on the very confines ofthe Transbaikal regions near the river Vitema (eastern Siberia) which practicessorcery as known in the days of the Thessalian witches. Their religious beliefsare curious as a mixture of philosophy and superstition. They have a chief orsupreme god Aij-Taion, who did not create, they say, but only presides over thecreation of all the worlds. He lives on the ninth heaven, and it is but from theseventh that the other minor gods--his servants--can manifest themselves totheir creatures. This ninth heaven, according to the revelation of the minordeities (spirits, we suppose), has three suns and three moons, and the ground ofthis abode is formed of four lakes (the four cardinal points) of \"soft air\"(ether), instead of water. While they offer no sacrifices to the Supreme Deity,for he needs none, they do try to propitiate both the good and bad deities,which they respectively term the \"white\" and the \"black\" gods. They do it,because neither of the two classes are good or bad through personal merit ordemerit. As they are all subject to the Supreme Aij-Taion, and each has to carryon the duty assigned to him from eternity, they are not responsible for eitherthe good or evil they produce in this world. The reason given by the Yakuts forsuch sacrifices is very curious. Sacrifices, they say, help each class of godsto perform their mission the better, and so please the Supreme; and every mortalthat helps either of them in performing his duty must, therefore, please theSupreme as well, for he will have helped justice to take place. As the \"black\"gods are appointed to bring diseases, evils, and all kinds of calamities tomankind, each of which is a punishment for some transgression, the Yakuts offerto them \"bloody\" sacrifices of animals; while to the \"white\" they make pureofferings, consisting generally of an animal consecrated to some special god andtaken care of with great ceremony, as having become sacred. According to theirideas the souls of the dead become \"shadows,\" and are doomed to wander on earth,till a certain change takes place either for the better or worse, which theYakuts do not pretend to explain. The light shadows, i.e., those of good people,become the guardians and protectors of those they loved on earth; the \"dark\"shadows (the wicked) always seek, on the contrary, to hurt those they knew, byinciting them to crimes, wicked acts, and otherwise injuring mortals. Besidesthese, like the ancient Chaldees, they reckon seven divine Sheitans (daemons) orminor gods. It is during the sacrifices of blood, which take place at night,that the Yakuts call forth the wicked or dark shadows, to inquire of them whatthey can do to arrest their mischief; hence, blood is necessary, for without itsfumes the ghosts could not make themselves clearly visible, and would become,according to their ideas, but the more dangerous, for they would suck it fromliving persons by their perspiration. * As to the good, light shadows, they neednot be called out; besides that, such an act disturbs them; they can make theirpresence felt, when needed, without any preparation and ceremonies. The blood-evocation is also practiced, although with a different purpose, inseveral parts of Bulgaria and Moldavia, especially in districts in the vicinityof Mussulmans. The fearful oppressions and slavery to which these unfortunateChristians have been subjected for centuries has rendered them a thousand-foldmore impressible, and at the same time more superstitious, than those who livein civilized countries. On every seventh of May the inhabitants of everyMoldavo-Valachian and Bulgarian city or village, have what they term the \"feastof the dead.\" After sunset, immense crowds of women and men, each with a lightedwax taper in hand, resort to the burial places, and pray on the tombs of theirdeparted friends. This ancient and solemn ceremony, called Trizna, is everywherea reminiscence of primitive Christian rites, but far more solemn yet, while inMussulman slavery. Every tomb is furnished with a kind of cupboard, about half ayard high, built of four stones, and with hinged double-doors. These closetscontain what is termed the household of the defunct: namely, a few wax tapers,some oil and an earthen lamp, which is lighted on that day, and burns fortwenty-four hours. Wealthy people have silver lamps richly chiselled, andbejewelled images, which are secure from thieves, for in the burial ground theclosets are even left open. Such is the dread of the population (Mussulman andChristian) of the revenge of the dead that a thief bold enough to commit anymurder, would never dare touch the property of a dead person. The Bulgarianshave a belief that every Saturday, and especially the eve of Easter Sunday, anduntil Trinity day (about seven weeks) the souls of the dead descend on earth,some to beg forgiveness from those living whom they had wronged; others toprotect and commune with their loved ones. Faithfully following the traditionalrites of their forefathers, the natives on each Saturday of these seven weekskeep either lamps or tapers lighted. In addition to that, on the seventh of Maythey drench the tombs with grape wine, and burn incense around them from sunsetto sunrise. With the inhabitants of towns, the ceremony is limited to thesesimple observances. With some of the rustics though, the rite assumes theproportions of a theurgic evocation. On the eve of Ascension Day, Bulgarianwomen light a quantity of tapers and lamps; the pots are placed upon tripods,and incense perfumes the atmosphere for miles around; while thick white cloudsof smoke envelope each tomb, as though a veil had separated it from the others.During the evening, and until a little before midnight, in memory of thedeceased, acquaintances and a certain number of mendicants are fed and treatedwith wine and raki (grape-whiskey), and money is distributed among the pooraccording to the means of the surviving relatives. When the feast is ended, theguests approaching the tomb and addressing the defunct by name, thank him or herfor the bounties received. When all but the nearest relatives are gone, a woman,usually the most aged, remains alone with the dead, and--some say--resorts tothe ceremony of invocation. After fervent prayers, repeated face downward on the grave-mound, more or lessdrops of blood are drawn from near the left bosom, and allowed to trickle uponthe tomb. This gives strength to the invisible spirit which hovers around, toassume for a few instants a visible form, and whisper his instructions to theChristian theurgist--if he has any to offer, or simply to \"bless the mourner\"and then disappear again till the following year. So firmly rooted is thisbelief that we have heard, in a case of family difficulty, a Moldavian womanappeal to her sister to put off every decision till Ascension-night, when theirdead father would be able to tell them of his will and pleasure in person; towhich the sister consented as simply as though their parent were in the nextroom. That there are fearful secrets in nature may well be believed when, as we haveseen in the case of the Russian Znachar, the sorcerer cannot die until he haspassed the word to another, and the hierophants of White Magic rarely do. Itseems as if the dread power of the \"Word\" could only be entrusted to one man ofa certain district or body of people at a time. When the Brahmatma was about tolay aside the burden of physical existence, he imparted his secret to hissuccessor, either orally, or by a writing placed in a securely-fastened casketwhich went into the latter's hands alone. Moses \"lays his hands\" upon hisneophyte, Joshua, in the solitudes of Nebo and passes away forever. Aaroninitiates Eleazar on Mount Hor, and dies. Siddhartha-Buddha promises hismendicants before his death to live in him who shall deserve it, embraces hisfavorite disciple, whispers in his ear, and dies; and as John's head lies uponthe bosom of Jesus, he is told that he shall \"tarry\" until he shall come. Likesignal-fires of the olden times, which, lighted and extinguished by turns uponone hill-top after another, conveyed intelligence along a whole stretch ofcountry, so we see a long line of \"wise\" men from the beginning of history downto our own times communicating the word of wisdom to their direct successors.Passing from seer to seer, the \"Word\" flashes out like lightning, and whilecarrying off the initiator from human sight forever, brings the new initiateinto view. Meanwhile, whole nations murder each other in the name of another\"Word,\" an empty substitute accepted literally by each, and misinterpreted byall! We have met few sects which truly practice sorcery. One such is the Yezidis,considered by some a branch of the Koords, though we believe erroneously. Theseinhabit chiefly the mountainous and desolate regions of Asiatic Turkey, aboutMosul, Armenia, and are found even in Syria, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu110.htm#fn_1112] and Mesopotamia. They arecalled and known everywhere as devil-worshippers; and most certainly it is noteither through ignorance or mental obscuration that they have set up the worshipand a regular inter-communication with the lowest and the most malicious of bothelementals and elementaries. They recognize the present wickedness of the chiefof the \"black powers\"; but at the same time they dread his power, and so try toconciliate to themselves his favors. He is in an open quarrel with Allah, theysay, but a reconciliation can take place between the two at any day; and thosewho have shown marks of their disrespect to the \"black one\" now, may suffer forit at some future time, and thus have both God and Devil against them. This issimply a cunning policy that seeks to propitiate his Satanic majesty, who is noother than the great Tcherno-bog (the black god) of the Variagi-Russ, theancient idolatrous Russians before the days of Vladimir. Like Wierus, the famous demonographer of the sixteenth century (who in hisPseudomonarchia Daemonum describes and enumerates a regular infernal court,which has its dignitaries, princes, dukes, nobles, and officers), the Yezidishave a whole pantheon of devils, and use the Jakshas, aerial spirits, to conveytheir prayers and respects to Satan their master, and the Afrites of the Desert.During their prayer-meetings, they join hands, and form immense rings, withtheir Sheik, or an officiating priest in the middle who claps his hands, andintones every verse in honor of Sheitan (Satan). Then they whirl and leap in theair. When the frenzy is at its climax, they often wound and cut themselves withtheir daggers, occasionally rendering the same service to their next neighbors.But their wounds do not heal and cicatrize as easily as in the case of lamas andholy men; for but too often they fall victims to these self-inflicted wounds.While dancing and flourishing high their daggers without unclasping hands--forthis would be considered a sacrilege, and the spell instantly broken, they coaxand praise Sheitan, and entreat him to manifest himself in his works by\"miracles.\" As their rites are chiefly accomplished during night, they do notfail to obtain manifestations of various character, the least of which areenormous globes of fire which take the shapes of the most uncouth animals. Lady Hester Stanhope, whose name was for many years a power among the masonicfraternities of the East, is said to have witnessed, personally, several ofthese Yezidean ceremonies. We were told by an Ockhal, of the sect of Druses,that after having been present at one of the Yezidis' \"Devil's masses,\" as theyare called, this extraordinary lady, so noted for personal courage and daringbravery, fainted, and notwithstanding her usual Emir's male attire, was recalledto life and health with the greatest difficulty. Personally, we regret to say,all our efforts to witness one of these performances failed. A recent article in a Catholic journal on Nagualism and Voodooism charges Haytiwith being the centre of secret societies, with terrible forms of initiation andbloody rites, where human infants are sacrificed and devoured by the adepts(!!). Piron, a French traveller, is quoted at length, describing a most fearfulscene witnessed by him in Cuba, in the house of a lady whom he never would havesuspected of any connection with so monstrous a sect. \"A naked white girl actedas a voodoo priestess, wrought up to frenzy by dances and incantations thatfollowed the sacrifice of a white and a black hen. A serpent, trained to itspart, and acted on by the music, coiled round the limbs of the girl, its motionsstudied by the votaries dancing around or standing to watch its contortions. Thespectator fled at last in horror when the poor girl fell writhing in anepileptic fit.\" While deploring such a state of things in Christian countries, the Catholicarticle in question explains this tenacity for ancestral religious rites asevidence of the natural depravity of the human heart, and makes a loud call forgreater zeal on the part of Catholics. Besides repeating the absurd fictionabout devouring children, the writer seems wholly insensible to the fact that adevotion to one's faith that centuries of the most cruel and bloody persecutioncannot quench, makes heroes and martyrs of a people, whereas their conversion toany other faith would turn them simply into renegades. A compulsory religion cannever breed anything but deceit. The answer received by the missionary Margilfrom some Indians supports the above truism. The question being: \"How is it thatyou are so heathenish after having been Christians so long?\" The answer was:\"What would you do, father, if enemies of your faith entered your land? Wouldyou not take all your books and vestments and signs of religion and retire tothe most secret caves and mountains? This is just what our priests, andprophets, and soothsayers, and nagualists have done to this time and are stilldoing.\" Such an answer from a Roman Catholic, questioned by a missionary of either Greekor Protestant Church, would earn for him the crown of a saint in the Popishmartyrology. Better a \"heathen\" religion that can extort from a Francis Xaviersuch a tribute as he pays the Japanese, in saying that \"in virtue and probitythey surpassed all the nations he had ever seen\"; than a Christianity whoseadvance over the face of the earth sweeps aboriginal nations out of existence aswith a hurricane of fire. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu110.htm#fn_1113] Disease, drunkenness, anddemoralization are the immediate results of apostasy from the faith of theirfathers, and conversion into a religion of mere forms. What Christianity is doing for British India, we need go to no inimical sourcesto inquire. Captain O'Grady, the British ex-official, says: \"The Britishgovernment is doing a shameful thing in turning the natives of India from asober race to a nation of drunkards. And for pure greed. Drinking is forbiddenby the religion alike of Hindus and Mussulmans. But . . . drinking is dailybecoming more and more prevalent. . . . What the accursed opium traffic, forcedon China by British greed, has been to that unhappy country, the government saleof liquor is likely to become to India. For it is a government monopoly, basedon almost precisely the same model as the government monopoly of tobacco inSpain. . . . The outside domestics in European families usually get to beterrible drunkards. . . . The indoor servants usually detest drinking, and are agood deal more respectable in this particular than their masters and mistresses. . . everybody drinks . . . bishops, chaplains, freshly-importedboarding-school girls, and all.\" Yes, these are the \"blessings\" that the modern Christian religion brings withits Bibles and Catechisms to the \"poor heathen.\" Rum and bastardy to Hindustan;opium to China; rum and foul disorders to Tahiti; and, worst of all, the exampleof hypocrisy in religion, and a practical skepticism and atheism, which, sinceit seems to be good enough for civilized people, may well in time be thoughtgood enough for those whom theology has too often been holding under a veryheavy yoke. On the other hand, everything that is noble, spiritual, elevating,in the old religion is denied, and even deliberately falsified. Take Paul, read the little of original that is left of him in the writingsattributed to this brave, honest, sincere man, and see whether any one can finda word therein to show that Paul meant by the word Christ anything more than theabstract ideal of the personal divinity indwelling in man. For Paul, Christ isnot a person, but an embodied idea. \"If any man is in Christ he is a newcreation,\" he is reborn, as after initiation, for the Lord is spirit--the spiritof man. Paul was the only one of the apostles who had understood the secretideas underlying the teachings of Jesus, although he had never met him. But Paulhad been initiated himself; and, bent upon inaugurating a new and broad reform,one embracing the whole of humanity, he sincerely set his own doctrines farabove the wisdom of the ages, above the ancient Mysteries and final revelationto the epoptae. As Professor A. Wilder well proves in a series of able articles,it was not Jesus, but Paul who was the real founder of Christianity. \"Thedisciples were called Christians first in Antioch,\" say the Acts of theApostles. \"Such men as Irenaeus, Epiphanius, and Eusebius have transmitted toposterity a reputation for untruth and dishonest practices; and the heartsickens at the story of the crimes of that period,\" writes this author, in arecent article. * \"It will be remembered,\" he adds, \"that when the Moslemsoverran Syria and Asia Minor for the first time, they were welcomed by theChristians of those regions as deliverers from the intolerable oppression of theruling authorities of the Church.\" Mahomet never was, neither is he now, considered a god; yet under the stimulusof his name millions of Moslems have served their God with an ardor that cannever be paralleled by Christian sectarianism. That they have sadly degeneratedsince the days of their prophet, does not alter the case in hand, but onlyproves the more the prevalence of matter over spirit all over the world.Besides, they have never degenerated more from primitive faith than Christiansthemselves. Why, then, should not Jesus of Nazareth, a thousandfold higher,nobler, and morally grander than Mahomet, be as well revered by Christians andfollowed in practice, instead of being blindly adored in fruitless faith as agod, and at the same time worshipped much after the fashion of certainBuddhists, who turn their wheel of prayers. That this faith has become sterile,and is no more worthy the name of Christianity than the fetishism of Calmucksthat of the philosophy preached by Buddha, is doubted by none. \"We would not besupposed to entertain the opinion,\" says Dr. Wilder, \"that modern Christianityis in any degree identical with the religion preached by Paul. It lacks hisbreadth of view, his earnestness, his keen spiritual perception. Bearing theimpress of the nations by which it is professed, it exhibits as many forms asthere are races. It is one thing in Italy and Spain, but widely differs inFrance, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Great Britain, Russia, Armenia, Kurdistan, andAbyssinia. As compared with the preceding worships, the change seems to be morein name than in genius. Men had gone to bed Pagans and awoke Christians. As forthe Sermon on the Mount, its conspicuous doctrines are more or less repudiatedby every Christian community of any considerable dimensions. Barbarism,oppression, cruel punishments, are as common now as in the days of Paganism. \"The Christianity of Peter exists no more; that of Paul supplanted it, and wasin its turn amalgamated with the other world-religions. When mankind areenlightened, or the barbarous races and families are supplanted by those ofnobler nature and instincts, the ideal excellencies may become realities. \"The 'Christ of Paul' has constituted an enigma which evoked the most strenuousendeavor to solve. He was something else than the Jesus of the Gospels. Pauldisregarded utterly their 'endless genealogies.' The author of the fourthGospel, himself an Alexandrian Gnostic, describes Jesus as what would now betermed a 'materialized' divine spirit. He was the Logos, or First Emanation--theMetathron. . . . The 'mother of Jesus,' like the Princess Maya, Danae, orperhaps Periktione, had given birth, not to a love-child, but to a divineoffspring. No Jew of whatever sect, no apostle, no early believer, everpromulgated such an idea. Paul treats of Christ as a personage rather than as aperson. The sacred lessons of the secret assemblies often personified the divinegood and the divine truth in a human form, assailed by the passions andappetites of mankind, but superior to them; and this doctrine, emerging from thecrypt, was apprehended by churchlings and gross-minded men as that of immaculateconception and divine incarnation.\" In the old book, published in 1693 and written by the Sieur de la Loubere,French Ambassador to the King of Siam, are related many interesting facts of theSiamese religion. The remarks of the satirical Frenchman are so pointed that wewill quote his words about the Siamese Saviour--Sommona-Cadom. \"How marvellous soever they pretend the birth of their Saviour has been, theycease not to give him a father and a mother. * His mother, whose name is foundin some of their Balie (Pali?) books, was called, as they say, Maha MARIA, whichseems to signify the great Mary, for Maha signifies great. However it be, thisceases not to give attention to the missionaries, and has perhaps given occasionto the Siamese to believe that Jesus being the son of Mary, was brother toSommona-Cadom, and that, having been crucified, he was that wicked brother whomthey give to Sommona-Cadom, under the name of Thevetat, and whom they report tobe punished in Hell, with a punishment which participates something of a cross.. . . The Siamese expect another Sommona-Cadom, I mean, another miraculous manlike him, whom they already named Pronarote, and whom they say was foretold bySommona. He made all sorts of miracles. . . . He had two disciples, bothstanding on each hand of his idol; one on the right hand, and the other on theleft . . . the first is named Pra-Magla, and the second Pra Scaribout. . . . Thefather of Sommona-Cadom was, according to this same Balie Book, a King of TeveLanca, that is to say, a King of Ceylon. But the Balie Books being without dateand without the author's name, have no more authority than all the traditions,whose origin is unknown.\" ** This last argument is as ill-considered as it is naively expressed. We do notknow of any book in the whole world less authenticated as to date, authors'names, or tradition, than our Christian Bible. Under these circumstances theSiamese have as much reason to believe in their miraculous Sommona-Cadom as theChristians in their miraculously-born Saviour. Moreover, they have no betterright to force their religion upon the Siamese, or any other people, againsttheir will, and in their own country, where they go unasked, than the so-calledheathen \"to compel France or England to accept Buddhism at the point of thesword.\" A Buddhist missionary, even in free-thinking America, would daily riskbeing mobbed, but this does not at all prevent missionaries from abusing thereligion of the Brahmans, Lamas, and Bonzes, publicly to their teeth; and thelatter are not always at liberty to answer them. This is termed diffusing thebeneficent light of Christianity and civilization upon the darkness ofheathenism! And yet we find that these pretensions--which might appear ludicrous were theynot so fatal to millions of our fellow-men, who only ask to be left alone--werefully appreciated as early as in the seventeenth century. We find the same wittyMonsieur de la Loubere, under a pretext of pious sympathy, giving some trulycurious instructions to the ecclesiastical authorities at home, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu110.htm#fn_1117] which embody the verysoul of Jesuitism. \"From what I have said concerning the opinions of the Orientals,\" he remarks,\"it is easy to comprehend how difficult an enterprise it is to bring them overto the Christian religion; and of what consequence it is that the missionaries,which preach the Gospel in the East, do perfectly understand the manners andbelief of these people. For as the apostles and first Christians, when Godsupported their preaching by so many wonders, did not on a sudden discover tothe heathens all the mysteries which we adore, but a long time concealed fromthem, and the Catechumens themselves, the knowledge of those which mightscandalize them; it seems very rational to me that the missionaries, who havenot the gift of miracles, ought not presently to discover to the Orientals allthe mysteries nor all the practices of Christianity. \"'Twould be convenient, for example, if I am not mistaken, not to preach untothem, without great caution, the worshipping of saints; and as to the knowledgeof Jesus Christ, I think it would be necessary to manage it with them, if I mayso say, and not to speak to them of the mystery of the Incarnation, till afterhaving convinced them of the existence of a God Creator. For what probability isthere, to begin with, of persuading the Siamese to remove Sommona-Cadom, PraMogla, and Pra Scaribout from the altars, to set up Jesus Christ, St. Peter, andSt. Paul, in their stead? 'Twould, perhaps, be more proper not to preach untothem Jesus Christ crucified, till they have first comprehended that one may beunfortunate and innocent; and that by the rule received, even amongst them,which is, that the innocent might load himself with the crimes of the guilty, itwas necessary that a god should become man, to the end that this man-God should,by a laborious life, and a shameful but voluntary death, satisfy for all thesins of men; but before all things it would be necessary to give them the trueidea of a God Creator, and justly provoked against men. The Eucharist, afterthis, will not scandalize the Siamese, as it formerly scandalized the Pagans ofEurope; forasmuch as the Siamese do not believe Sommona-Cadom could give hiswife and children to the Talapoins to eat. \"On the contrary, as the Chinese are respectful toward their parents even to ascruple, I doubt not that if the Gospel should be presently put into theirhands, they would be scandalized at that place, where, when some told JesusChrist that his mother and his brethren asked after him, he answered in such amanner, that he seems so little to regard them, that he affected not to knowthem. They would not be less offended at those other mysterious words, which ourdivine Saviour spoke to the young man, who desired time to go and bury hisparents: 'Let the dead,' said he, 'bury the dead.' Every one knows the troublewhich the Japanese expressed to St. Francis Xavier upon the eternity ofdamnation, not being able to believe that their dead parents should fall into sohorrible a misfortune for want of having embraced Christianity, which they hadnever heard of. . . . It seems necessary, therefore, to prevent and mollify thisthought, by the means which that great apostle of the Indies used, in firstestablishing the idea of an omnipotent, all-wise, and most just God, the authorof all good, to whom only everything is due, and by whose will we owe untokings, bishops, magistrates and to our parents the respects which we owe them. \"These examples are sufficient to show with what precautions it is necessary toprepare the minds of the Orientals to think like us, and not to be offended withmost of the articles of the Christian faith.\" * And what, we ask, is left to preach? With no Saviour, no atonement, nocrucifixion for human sin, no Gospel, no eternal damnation to tell them of, andno miracles to display, what remained for the Jesuits to spread among theSiamese but the dust of the Pagan sanctuaries with which to blind their eyes?The sarcasm is biting indeed. The morality to which these poor heathen are madeto adhere by their ancestral faith is so pure, that Christianity has to bestripped of every distinguishing mark before its priests can venture to offer itfor their examination. A religion that cannot be trusted to the scrutiny of anunsophisticated people who are patterns of filial piety, of honest dealing, ofdeep reverence for God and an instinctive horror of profaning His majesty, mustindeed be founded upon error. That it is so, our century is discovering littleby little. In the general spoliation of Buddhism to make up the new Christian religion, itwas not to be expected that so peerless a character as Gautama-Buddha would beleft unappropriated. It was but natural that after taking his legendary historyto fill out the blanks left in the fictitious story of Jesus, after using whatthey could of Christna's, they should take the man Sakya-muni and put him intheir calendar under an alias. This they actually did, and the Hindu Saviour indue time appeared on the list of saints as Josaphat, to keep company with thosemartyrs of religion, SS. Aura and Placida, Longinus and Amphibolus. In Palermo there is even a church dedicated to Divo Josaphat. Among the vainattempts of subsequent ecclesiastical writers to fix the genealogy of thismysterious saint, the most original was the making him Joshua, the son of Nun.But these trifling difficulties being at last surmounted, we find the history ofGautama copied word for word from Buddhist sacred books, into the Golden Legend.Names of individuals are changed, the place of action, India, remains thesame--in the Christian as in the Buddhist Legends. It can be also found in theSpeculum Historiale of Vincent of Beauvais, which was written in the thirteenthcentury. The first discovery is due to the historian de Couto, althoughProfessor Muller credits the first recognition of the identity of the twostories to M. Laboulaye, in 1859. Colonel Yule tells us that * these stories ofBarlaam and Josaphat, are recognized by Baronius, and are to be found at p. 348,of The Roman Martyrology, set forth by command of Pope Gregory XIII., andrevised by the authority of Pope Urban VIII., translated out of Latin intoEnglish by G. K. of the Society of Jesus. ** To repeat even a small portion of this ecclesiastical nonsense would be tediousand useless. Let him who doubts and who would learn the story read it as givenby Colonel Yule. Some *** of the Christian and ecclesiastical speculations seemto have embarrassed even Dominie Valentyn. \"There be some, who hold this Budhumfor a fugitive Syrian Jew,\" he writes; \"others who hold him for a disciple ofthe Apostle Thomas; but how in that case he could have been born 622 yearsbefore Christ I leave them to explain. Diego de Couto stands by the belief thathe was certainly Joshua, which is still more absurd!\" \"The religious romance called The History of Barlaam and Josaphat was, forseveral centuries, one of the most popular works in Christendom,\" says Col.Yule. \"It was translated into all the chief European languages, includingScandinavian and Sclavonic tongues. . . . This story first appears among theworks of St. John of Damascus, a theologian of the early part of the eighthcentury.\" **** Here then lies the secret of its origin, for this St. John,before he became a divine, held a high office at the court of the Khalif AbuJafar Almansur, where he probably learned the story, and afterwards adapted itto the new orthodox necessities of the Buddha turned into a Christian saint. Having repeated the plagiarized story, Diego de Couto, who seems to yield upwith reluctance his curious notion that Gautama was Joshua, says: \"To this name(Budao) the Gentiles throughout all India have dedicated great and superbpagodas. With reference to this story, we have been diligent in inquiring if theancient Gentiles of those parts had in their writings any knowledge of St.Josaphat who was converted by Balaam, and who in his legend is represented asthe son of a great king of India, and who had just the same up-bringing, withall the same particulars that we have recounted of the life of the Budao. And asI was travelling in the Isle of Salsette, and went to see that rare andadmirable pagoda, which we call the Canara Pagoda (Kanhari Caves) made in amountain, with many halls cut out of one solid rock, and inquiring of an old manabout the work, what he thought as to who had made it, he told us that withoutdoubt the work was made by order of the father of St. Josaphat to bring him upin seclusion, as the story tells. And as it informs us that he was the son of agreat king in India, it may well be, as we have just said, that he was theBudao, of whom they relate such marvels.\" * The Christian legend is taken, moreover, in most of its details, from theCeylonese tradition. It is on this island that originated the story of youngGautama rejecting his father's throne, and the king's erecting a superb palacefor him, in which he kept him half prisoner, surrounded by all the temptationsof life and wealth. Marco Polo told it as he had it from the Ceylonese, and hisversion is now found to be a faithful repetition of what is given in the variousBuddhist books. As Marco naively expresses it, Buddha led a life of suchhardship and sanctity, and kept such great abstinence, \"just as if he had been aChristian. Indeed,\" he adds, \"had he but been so, he would have been a greatsaint of our Lord Jesus Christ, so good and pure was the life he led.\" To whichpious apothegm his editor very pertinently remarks that \"Marco is not the onlyeminent person who has expressed this view of Sakya-muni's life in such words.\"And in his turn Prof. Max Muller says: \"And whatever we may think of thesanctity of saints, let those who doubt the right of Buddha to a place amongthem, read the story of his life as it is told in the Buddhistical canon. If helived the life which is there described, few saints have a better claim to thetitle than Buddha; and no one either in the Greek or the Roman Church need beashamed of having paid to his memory the honor that was intended for St.Josaphat, the prince, the hermit, and the saint.\" The Roman Catholic Church has never had so good a chance to Christianize allChina, Thibet, and Tartary, as in the thirteenth century, during the reign ofKublai-Khan. It seems strange that they did not embrace the opportunity whenKublai was hesitating at one time between the four religions of the world, and,perhaps through the eloquence of Marco Polo, favored Christianity more thaneither Mahometanism, Judaism, or Buddhism. Marco Polo and Ramusio, one of hisinterpreters, tell us why. It seems that, unfortunately for Rome, the embassy ofMarco's father and uncle failed, because Clement IV. happened to die just atthat very time. There was no Pope for several months to receive the friendlyovertures of Kublai-Khan; and thus the one hundred Christian missionariesinvited by him could not be sent to Thibet and Tartary. To those who believethat there is an intelligent Deity above who takes a certain concern in thewelfare of our miserable little world, this contretemps must in itself seem apretty good proof that Buddhism should have the best of Christianity.Perhaps--who knows--Pope Clement fell sick so as to save the Buddhists fromsinking into the idolatry of Roman Catholicism? From pure Buddhism, the religion of these districts has degenerated intolamaism; but the latter, with all its blemishes--purely formalistic andimpairing but little the doctrine itself--is yet far above Catholicism. The poorAbbe Huc very soon found it out for himself. As he moved on with his caravan, hewrites--\"every one repeated to us that, as we advanced toward the west, weshould find the doctrines growing more luminous and sublime. Lha-Ssa was thegreat focus of light, the rays from which became weakened as they werediffused.\" One day he gave to a Thibetan lama \"a brief summary of Christiandoctrine, which appeared by no means unfamiliar to him [we do not wonder atthat], and he even maintained that it [Catholicism] did not differ much from thefaith of the grand lamas of Thibet. . . . These words of the Thibetan lamaastonished us not a little,\" writes the missionary; \"the unity of God, themystery of the Incarnation, the dogma of the real presence, appeared to us inhis belief. . . . The new light thrown on the religion of Buddha induced usreally to believe that we should find among the lamas of Thibet a more purifiedsystem.\" * It is these words of praise to lamaism, with which Huc's bookabounds, that caused his work to be placed on the Index at Rome, and himself tobe unfrocked. When questioned why, since he held the Christian faith to be the best of thereligions protected by him, he did not attach himself to it, the answer given byKublai-Khan is as suggestive as it is curious: \"How would you have me to become a Christian? There are four prophets worshippedand revered by all the world. The Christians say their God is Jesus Christ; theSaracens, Mahomet; the Jews, Moses; the idolaters, Sogomon Borkan (Sakya-muniBurkham, or Buddha), who was the first god among the idols; and I worship andpay respect to all four, and pray that he among them who is greatest in heavenin very truth may aid me.\" We may ridicule the Khan's prudence; we cannot blame him for trustingly leavingthe decision of the puzzling dilemma to Providence itself. One of his mostunsurmountable objections to embrace Christianity he thus specifies to Marco:\"You see that the Christians of these parts are so ignorant that they achievenothing and can achieve nothing, whilst you see the idolaters can do anythingthey please, insomuch that when I sit at table, the cups from the middle of thehall come to me full of wine or other liquor, without being touched by anybody,and I drink from them. They control storms, causing them to pass in whateverdirection they please, and do many other marvels; whilst, as you know, theiridols speak, and give them predictions on whatever subjects they choose. But ifI were to turn to the faith of Christ and become a Christian, then my barons andothers who are not converted, would say: 'What has moved you to be baptized? . .. What powers or miracles have you witnessed on the part of Christ? You know theidolaters here say that their wonders are performed by the sanctity and power oftheir idols.' Well, I should not know what answer to make, so they would only beconfirmed in their errors, and the idolaters, who are adepts in such surprisingarts, would easily compass my death. But now you shall go to your Pope, and prayhim on my part to send hither an hundred men skilled in your law; and if theyare capable of rebuking the practices of idolaters to their faces, and ofproving to them that they too know how to do such things, but will not, becausethey are done by the help of the Devil and other evil spirits; and if they socontrol the idolaters that these shall have no power to perform such things intheir presence, and when we shall witness this, we will denounce the idolatersand their religion, and then I will receive baptism, and then all my barons andchiefs shall be baptized also, and thus, in the end, there will be moreChristians here than exist in your part of the world.\" * The proposition was fair. Why did not the Christians avail themselves of it?Moses is said to have faced such an ordeal before Pharaoh, and come offtriumphant. To our mind, the logic of this uneducated Mongol was unanswerable, his intuitionfaultless. He saw good results in all religions, and felt that, whether a man beBuddhist, Christian, Mahometan, or Jew, his spiritual powers might equally bedeveloped, his faith equally lead him to the highest truth. All he asked beforemaking choice of a creed for his people, was the evidence upon which to basefaith. To judge alone by its jugglers, India must certainly be better acquainted withalchemy, chemistry, and physics than any European academy. The psychologicalwonders produced by some fakirs of Southern Hindustan, and by the shaberons andhobilhans of Thibet and Mongolia, alike prove our case. The science ofpsychology has there reached an acme of perfection never attained elsewhere inthe annals of the marvellous. That such powers are not alone due to study, butare natural to every human being, is now proved in Europe and America by thephenomena of mesmerism and what is termed \"spiritualism.\" If the majority offoreign travellers, and residents in British India, are disposed to regard thewhole as clever jugglery, not so with a few Europeans who have had the rare luckto be admitted behind the veil in the pagodas. Surely these will not deride therites, nor undervalue the phenomena produced in the secret lodges of India. Themahadthevassthanam of the pagodas (usually termed goparam, from the sacredpyramidal gateway by which the buildings are entered) has been known toEuropeans before now, though to a mere handful in all. We do not know whether the prolific Jacolliot * was ever admitted into one ofthese lodges. It is extremely doubtful, we should say, if we may judge from hismany fantastic tales of the immoralities of the mystical rites among theBrahmans, the fakirs of the pagodas, and even the Buddhists (!!) at all of whichhe makes himself figure as a Joseph. Anyhow, it is evident that the Brahmanstaught him no secrets, for speaking of the fakirs and their wonders, he remarks,\"under the direction of initiated Brahmans they practice in the seclusion of thepagodas, the occult sciences. . . . And let no one be surprised at this word,which seems to open the door of the supernatural; while there are in thesciences which the Brahmans call occult, phenomena so extraordinary as to baffleall investigation, there is not one which cannot be explained, and which is notsubject to natural law.\" Unquestionably, any initiated Brahman could, if he would, explain everyphenomenon. But he will not. Meanwhile, we have yet to see an explanation by thebest of our physicists of even the most trivial occult phenomenon produced by afakir-pupil of a pagoda. Jacolliot says that it will be quite impracticable to give an account of themarvellous facts witnessed by himself. But adds, with entire truthfulness, \"letit suffice to say, that in regard to magnetism and spiritism, Europe has yet tostammer over the first letters of the alphabet, and that the Brahmans havereached, in these two departments of learning, results in the way of phenomenathat are truly stupefying. When one sees these strange manifestations, whosepower one cannot deny, without grasping the laws that the Brahmans keep socarefully concealed, the mind is overwhelmed with wonder, and one feels that hemust run away and break the charm that holds him.\" \"The only explanation that we have been able to obtain on the subject from alearned Brahman, with whom we were on terms of the closest intimacy, was this:'You have studied physical nature, and you have obtained, through the laws ofnature, marvellous results--steam, electricity, etc.; for twenty thousand yearsor more, we have studied the intellectual forces, we have discovered their laws,and we obtain, by making them act alone or in concert with matter, phenomenastill more astonishing than your own.' \" Jacolliot must indeed have been stupefied by wonders, for he says: \"We have seenthings such as one does not describe for fear of making his readers doubt hisintelligence . . . but still we have seen them. And truly one comprehends how,in presence of such facts, the ancient world believed . . . in possessions ofthe Devil and in exorcism.\" * But yet this uncompromising enemy of priestcraft, monastic orders, and theclergy of every religion and every land--including Brahmans, lamas, andfakirs--is so struck with the contrast between the fact-supported cults ofIndia, and the empty pretences of Catholicism, that after describing theterrible self-tortures of the fakirs, in a burst of honest indignation, he thusgives vent to his feelings: \"Nevertheless, these fakirs, these mendicantBrahmans, have still something grand about them: when they flagellatethemselves, when during the self-inflicted martyrdom the flesh is torn out bybits, the blood pours upon the ground. But you (Catholic mendicants), what doyou do to-day? You, Gray Friars, Capuchins, Franciscans, who play at fakirs,with your knotted cords, your flints, your hair shirts, and your rose-waterflagellations, your bare feet and your comical mortifications--fanatics withoutfaith, martyrs without tortures? Has not one the right to ask you, if it is toobey the law of God that you shut yourselves in behind thick walls, and thusescape the law of labor which weighs so heavily upon all other men? . . . Away,you are only beggars!\" Let them pass on--we have devoted too much space to them and their conglomeratetheology, already. We have weighed both in the balance of history, of logic, oftruth, and found them wanting. Their system breeds atheism, nihilism, despair,and crime; its priests and preachers are unable to prove by works theirreception of divine power. If both Church and priest could but pass out of thesight of the world as easily as their names do now from the eye of our reader,it would be a happy day for humanity. New York and London might then soon becomeas moral as a heathen city unoccupied by Christians; Paris be cleaner than theancient Sodom. When Catholic and Protestant would be as fully satisfied as aBuddhist or Brahman that their every crime would be punished, and every gooddeed rewarded, they might spend upon their own heathen what now goes to givemissionaries long picnics, and to make the name of Christian hated and despisedby every nation outside the boundaries of Christendom. -------- As occasion required, we have reinforced our argument with descriptions of a fewof the innumerable phenomena witnessed by us in different parts of the world.The remaining space at our disposal will be devoted to like subjects. Havinglaid a foundation by elucidating the philosophy of occult phenomena, it seemsopportune to illustrate the theme with facts that have occurred under our owneye, and that may be verified by any traveller.

Burnouf, p. 341. 550:***** Moses was a most notable practitioner of Hermetic Science. Bearing inmind that Moses (Asarsiph) is made to run away to the Land of Midian, and thathe \"sat down by a well\" (Exod. ii.), we find the following: The \"Well\" played a prominent part in the Mysteries of the Bacchic festivals. Inthe sacerdotal language of every country, it had the same significance. A wellis \"the fountain of salvation\" mentioned in Isaiah (xii. 3). The water is themale principle in its spiritual sense. In its physical relation in the allegoryof creation, the water is chaos, and chaos is the female principle vivified bythe Spirit of God--the male principle. In the \"Kabala,\" Zachar means \"male\"; andthe Jordan was called Zachar (\"Universal History,\" vol. ii., p. 429). It iscurious that the Father of St. John the Baptist, the Prophet ofJordan--Zacchar--should be called Zachar-ias. One of the names of Bacchus isZagreus. The ceremony of pouring water on the shrine was sacred in the Osirianrites as well as in the Mosaic institutions. In the Mishna it is said, \"Thoushalt dwell in Succa and pour out water seven, and the pipes six days\" (\"MishnaSuccah,\" p. 1). \"Take virgin earth . . . and work up the dust with livingWATER,\" prescribes the Sohar (Introduction to \"Sohar\"; \"Kabbala Denudata,\" ii.,pp. 220, 221). Only \"earth and water, according to Moses, can bring forth aliving soul,\" quotes Cornelius Agrippa. The water of Bacchus was considered toimpart the Holy Pneuma to the initiate; and it washes off all sin by baptismthrough the Holy Ghost, with the Christians. The \"well\" in the kabalistic sense,is the mysterious emblem of the Secret Doctrine. \"If any man thirst, let himcome unto me and drink,\" says Jesus (John vii.). Therefore, Moses the adept, is naturally enough represented sitting by a well.He is approached by the seven daughters of the Kenite Priest of Midian coming tofill the troughs, to water their father's flock. Here we have seven again--themystic number. In the present biblical allegory the daughters represent theseven occult powers. \"The shepherds came and drove them (the seven daughters)away, but Moses stood up, and helped them, and watered their flock.\" Theshepherds are shown, by some kabalistic interpreters, to represent the seven\"badly-disposed Stellars\" of the Nazarenes; for in the old Samaritan text thenumber of these Shepherds is also said to be seven (see kabalistic books). Then Moses, who had conquered the seven evil Powers, and won the friendship ofthe seven occult and beneficent ones, is represented as living with the ReuelPriest of Midian, who invites \"the Egyptian\" to eat bread, i.e., to partake ofhis wisdom. In the Bible the elders of Midian are known as great soothsayers anddiviners. Finally, Reuel or Jethro, the initiator and instructor of Moses, giveshim in marriage his daughter. This daughter is Zipporah, i.e., the esotericWisdom, the shining light of knowledge, for Siprah means the \"shining\" or\"resplendent,\" from the word \"Sapar\" to shine. Sippara, in Chaldea, was the cityof the \"Sun.\" Thus Moses was initiated by the Midianite, or rather the Kenite,and thence the biblical allegory. 551:*Schmidt: \"Der Weise und der Thor,\" p. 37. 552:* \"Rgya.

She is mentioned as the wifeof the Omnipotent Father, AEther, or Jupiter (\"The Symbolical Language ofAncient Art and Mythology,\" xxxvi.). Hence the word, of Christ, \"it is theSpirit that quickeneth, flesh profiteth nothing,\" applied in their dual meaningto both spiritual and terrestrial things, to spirit and matter. Bacchus, as Dionysus, is of Indian origin. Cicero mentions him as a son ofThyone and Nisus. Διονυσος means the god Dis from Mount Nys in India. Bacchus,crowned with ivy, or kissos, is Christna, one of whose names was Kissen.Dionysus is preeminently the deity on whom were centred all the hopes for futurelife; in short, he was the god who was expected to liberate the souls of menfrom their prisons of flesh. Orpheus, the poet-Argonaut, is also said to havecome on earth to purify the religion of its gross, and terrestrialanthropomorphism, he abolished human sacrifice and instituted a mystic theologybased on pure spirituality. Cicero calls Orpheus a son of Bacchus. It is strangethat both seem to have originally come from India. At least, as DionysusZagreus, Bacchus is of undoubted Hindu origin. Some writers deriving a curiousanalogy between the name of Orpheus and an old Greek term, ορφος, dark ortawny-colored, make him Hindu by connecting the term with his dusky Hinducomplexion.

ThePagan priests, who did not belong to the class of the hierophants, carried onfor awhile this hideous rite, and it served to screen the genuine purpose. Butthe Grecian Herakles is represented as the adversary of human sacrifices and asslaying the men and monsters who offered them. Bunsen shows, by the very absenceof any representation of human sacrifice on the oldest monuments, that thiscustom had been abolished in the old Empire, at the close of the seventh centuryafter Menes; therefore, 3,000 years B.C., Iphicrates had stopped the humansacrifices entirely among the Carthaginians. Diphilus ordered bulls to besubstituted for human victims. Amosis forced the priests to replace the latterby figures of wax. On the other hand, for every stranger offered on the shrineof Diana by the inhabitants of the Tauric Chersonesus, the Inquisition and theChristian clergy can boast of a dozen of heretics offered on the altar of the\"mother of God,\" and her \"Son.\" And when did the Christians ever think ofsubstituting either animals or wax-figures for living heretics, Jews, andwitches? They burned these in effigy only when, through providentialinterference, the doomed victims had escaped their clutches. 565:** This is why Jesus recommends prayer in the solitude of one's closet.

To comprehend the principles of natural law involved in the several phenomenahereinafter described, the reader must keep in mind the fundamental propositionsof the Oriental philosophy which we have successively elucidated. Let usrecapitulate very briefly: 1st. There is no miracle. Everything that happens is the result of law--eternal,immutable, ever active. Apparent miracle is but the operation of forcesantagonistic to what Dr. W. B. Carpenter, F. R. S.--a man of great learning butlittle knowledge--calls \"the well-ascertained laws of nature.\" Like many of hisclass, Dr. Carpenter ignores the fact that there may be laws once \"known,\" nowunknown to science. 2d. Nature is triune: there is a visible, objective nature; an invisible,indwelling, energizing nature, the exact model of the other, and its vitalprinciple; and, above these two, spirit, source of all forces, alone eternal,and indestructible. The lower two constantly change; the higher third does not. 3d. Man is also triune: he has his objective, physical body; his vitalizingastral body (or soul), the real man; and these two are brooded over andilluminated by the third--the sovereign, the immortal spirit. When the real mansucceeds in merging himself with the latter, he becomes an immortal entity. 4th. Magic, as a science, is the knowledge of these principles, and of the wayby which the omniscience and omnipotence of the spirit and its control overnature's forces may be acquired by the individual while still in the body.Magic, as an art, is the application of this knowledge in practice. 5th. Arcane knowledge misapplied, is sorcery; beneficently used, true magic orWISDOM. 6th. Mediumship is the opposite of adeptship; the medium is the passiveinstrument of foreign influences, the adept actively controls himself and allinferior potencies. 7th. All things that ever were, that are, or that will be, having their recordupon the astral light, or tablet of the unseen universe, the initiated adept, byusing the vision of his own spirit, can know all that has been known or can beknown. 8th. Races of men differ in spiritual gifts as in color, stature, or any otherexternal quality; among some peoples seership naturally prevails, among othersmediumship. Some are addicted to sorcery, and transmit its secret rules ofpractice from generation to generation, with a range of psychical phenomena,more or less wide, as the result. 9th. One phase of magical skill is the voluntary and conscious withdrawal of theinner man (astral form) from the outer man (physical body). In the cases of somemediums withdrawal occurs, but it is unconscious and involuntary. With thelatter the body is more or less cataleptic at such times; but with the adept theabsence of the astral form would not be noticed, for the physical senses arealert, and the individual appears only as though in a fit of abstraction--\"abrown study,\" as some call it. To the movements of the wandering astral form neither time nor space offerobstacles. The thaumaturgist, thoroughly skilled in occult science, can causehimself (that is, his physical body) to seem to disappear, or to apparently takeon any shape that he may choose. He may make his astral form visible, or he maygive it protean appearances. In both cases these results will be achieved by amesmeric hallucination of the senses of all witnesses, simultaneously broughton. This hallucination is so perfect that the subject of it would stake his lifethat he saw a reality, when it is but a picture in his own mind, impressed uponhis consciousness by the irresistible will of the mesmerizer. But, while the astral form can go anywhere, penetrate any obstacle, and be seenat any distance from the physical body, the latter is dependent upon ordinarymethods of transportation. It may be levitated under prescribed magneticconditions, but not pass from one locality to another except in the usual way.Hence we discredit all stories of the aerial flight of mediums in body, for suchwould be miracle, and miracle we repudiate. Inert matter may be, in certaincases and under certain conditions, disintegrated, passed through walls, andrecombined, but living animal organisms cannot. Swedenborgians believe and arcane science teaches that the abandonment of theliving body by the soul frequently occurs, and that we encounter every day, inevery condition of life, such living corpses. Various causes, among themoverpowering fright, grief, despair, a violent attack of sickness, or excessivesensuality may bring this about. The vacant carcass may be entered and inhabitedby the astral form of an adept sorcerer, or an elementary (an earth-bounddisembodied human soul), or, very rarely, an elemental. Of course, an adept ofwhite magic has the same power, but unless some very exceptional and greatobject is to be accomplished, he will never consent to pollute himself byoccupying the body of an impure person. In insanity, the patient's astral beingis either semi-paralyzed, bewildered, and subject to the influence of everypassing spirit of any sort, or it has departed forever, and the body is takenpossession of by some vampirish entity near its own disintegration, and clingingdesperately to earth, whose sensual pleasures it may enjoy for a brief seasonlonger by this expedient. 10th. The corner-stone of MAGIC is an intimate practical knowledge of magnetismand electricity, their qualities, correlations, and potencies. Especiallynecessary is a familiarity with their effects in and upon the animal kingdom andman. There are occult properties in many other minerals, equally strange withthat in the lodestone, which all practitioners of magic must know, and of whichso-called exact science is wholly ignorant. Plants also have like mysticalproperties in a most wonderful degree, and the secrets of the herbs of dreamsand enchantments are only lost to European science, and useless to say, too, areunknown to it, except in a few marked instances, such as opium and hashish. Yet,the psychical effects of even these few upon the human system are regarded asevidences of a temporary mental disorder. The women of Thessaly and Epirus, thefemale hierophants of the rites of Sabazius, did not carry their secrets awaywith the downfall of their sanctuaries.They are still preserved, and those whoare aware of the nature of Soma, know the properties of other plants as well. To sum up all in a few words, MAGIC is spiritual WISDOM; nature, the materialally, pupil and servant of the magician. One common vital principle pervades allthings, and this is controllable by the perfected human will. The adept canstimulate the movements of the natural forces in plants and animals in apreternatural degree. Such experiments are not obstructions of nature, butquickenings; the conditions of intenser vital action are given. The adept can control the sensations and alter the conditions of the physicaland astral bodies of other persons not adepts; he can also govern and employ, ashe chooses, the spirits of the elements. He cannot control the immortal spiritof any human being, living or dead, for all such spirits are alike sparks of theDivine Essence, and not subject to any foreign domination. There are two kinds of seership--that of the soul and that of the spirit. Theseership of the ancient Pythoness, or of the modern mesmerized subject, vary butin the artificial modes adopted to induce the state of clairvoyance. But, as thevisions of both depend upon the greater or less acuteness of the senses of theastral body, they differ very widely from the perfect, omniscient spiritualstate; for, at best, the subject can get but glimpses of truth, through the veilwhich physical nature interposes. The astral principle, or mind, called by theHindu Yogin fav-atma, is the sentient soul, inseparable from our physical brain,which it holds in subjection, and is in its turn equally trammelled by it. Thisis the ego, the intellectual life-principle of man, his conscious entity. Whileit is yet within the material body, the clearness and correctness of itsspiritual visions depend on its more or less intimate relation with its higherPrinciple. When this relation is such as to allow the most ethereal portions ofthe soul-essence to act independently of its grosser particles and of the brain,it can unerringly comprehend what it sees; then only is it the pure, rational,supersentient soul. That state is known in India as the Samaddi; it is thehighest condition of spirituality possible to man on earth. Fakirs try to obtainsuch a condition by holding their breath for hours together during theirreligious exercises, and call this practice dam-sadhna. The Hindu termsPranayama, Pratyahara, and Dharana, all relate to different psychologicalstates, and show how much more the Sanscrit, and even the modern Hindu languageare adapted to the clear elucidation of the phenomena that are encountered bythose who study this branch of psychological science, than the tongues of modernpeoples, whose experiences have not yet necessitated the invention of suchdescriptive terms.When the body is in the state of dharana--a total catalepsy ofthe physical frame--the soul of the clairvoyant may liberate itself, andperceive things subjectively. And yet, as the sentient principle of the brain isalive and active, these pictures of the past, present, and future will betinctured with the terrestrial perceptions of the objective world; the physicalmemory and fancy will be in the way of clear vision. But the seer-adept knowshow to suspend the mechanical action of the brain. His visions will be as clearas truth itself, uncolored and undistorted, whereas, the clairvoyant, unable tocontrol the vibrations of the astral waves, will perceive but more or lessbroken images through the medium of the brain. The seer can never takeflickering shadows for realities, for his memory being as completely subjectedto his will as the rest of the body, he receives impressions directly from hisspirit. Between his subjective and objective selves there are no obstructivemediums. This is the real spiritual seership, in which, according to anexpression of Plato, soul is raised above all inferior good. When we reach \"thatwhich is supreme, which is simple, pure, and unchangeable, without form, color,or human qualities: the God--our Nous.\" This is the state which such seers as Plotinus and Apollonius termed the \"Unionto the Deity\"; which the ancient Yogins called Isvara, * and the modern call\"Samaddi\"; but this state is as far above modern clairvoyance as the stars aboveglow-worms. Plotinus, as is well known, was a clairvoyant-seer during his wholeand daily life; and yet, he had been united to his God but six times during thesixty-six years of his existence, as he himself confessed to Porphyry. Ammonius Sakkas, the \"God-taught,\" asserts that the only power which is directlyopposed to soothsaying and looking into futurity is memory; and Olympiodoruscalls it phantasy. \"The phantasy,\" he says (in Platonis Phaed.), \"is animpediment to our intellectual conceptions; and hence, when we are agitated bythe inspiring influence of the Divinity, if the phantasy intervenes, theenthusiastic energy ceases; for enthusiasm and the ecstasy are contrary to eachother. Should it be asked whether the soul is able to energize without thephantasy, we reply, that its perception of universals proves that it is able. Ithas perceptions,therefore, independent of the phantasy; at the same time,however, the phantasy attends it in its energies, just as a storm pursues himwho sails on the sea.\" A medium, moreover, needs either a foreign intelligence--whether it be spirit orliving mesmerizer--to overpower his physical and mental parts, or somefactitious means to induce trance. An adept, and even a simple fakir requiresbut a few minutes of \"self-contemplation.\" The brazen columns of Solomon'stemple; the golden bells and pomegranates of Aaron; the Jupiter Capitolinus ofAugustus, hung around with harmonious bells; *and the brazen bowls of theMysteries when the Kora was called, ** were all intended for such artificialhelps. ***So were the brazen bowls of Solomon hung round with a double row of200 pomegranates, which served as clappers within the hollow columns. Thepriestesses of Northern Germany, under the guidance of hierophants, could neverprophesy but amidst the roar of the tumultuous waters. Regarding fixedly theeddies formed on the rapid course of the river they hypnotized themselves. So weread of Joseph, Jacob's son, who sought for divine inspiration with his silverdivining-cup, which must have had a very bright bottom to it. The priestesses ofDodona placed themselves under the ancient oak of Zeus (the Pelasgian, not theOlympian god), and listened intently to the rustling of the sacred leaves, whileothers concentrated their attention on the soft murmur of the cold springgushing from underneath its roots. **** But the adept has no need of any suchextraneous aids--the simple exertion of his will-power is all-sufficient. The Atharva-Veda teaches that the exercise of such will-power is the highestform of prayer and its instantaneous response. To desire is to realize inproportion to the intensity of the aspiration; and that, in its turn, ismeasured by inward purity. Some of these nobler Vedantic precepts on the soul and man's mystic powers, haverecently been contributed to an English periodical by a Hindu scholar. \"TheSankhya,\" he writes, \"inculcates that the soul (i. e., astral body) has thefollowing powers: shrinking into a minute bulk to which everything is pervious;enlarging to a gigantic body; assuming levity (rising along a sunbeam to thesolar orb); possessing an unlimited reach of organs, as touching the moon withthe tip of a finger; irresistible will (for instance, sinking into the earth aseasily as in water); dominion over all things, animate or inanimate; faculty ofchanging the course of nature; ability to accomplish every desire.\" Further, hegives their various appellations: \"The powers are called: 1, Anima; 2, Mahima; 3, Laghima; 4, Garima; 5, Prapti;6, Prakamya; 7, Vasitwa; 8, Isitwa, or divine power. The fifth, predictingfuture events, understanding unknown languages, curing diseases, diviningunexpressed thoughts, understanding the language of the heart. The sixth is thepower of converting old age into youth. The seventh is the power of mesmerizinghuman beings and beasts, and making them obedient; it is the power ofrestraining passions and emotions. The eighth power is the spiritual state, andpresupposes the absence of the above seven powers, as in this state the Yogi isfull of God.\" \"No writings,\" he adds, \"revealed or sacred, were allowed to be so authoritativeand final as the teaching of the soul. Some of the Rishis appear to have laidthe greatest stress on this supersensuous source of knowledge.\" * From the remotest antiquity mankind as a whole have always been convinced of theexistence of a personal spiritual entity within the personal physical man. Thisinner entity was more or less divine, according to its proximity to thecrown--Chrestos. The closer the union the more serene man's destiny, the lessdangerous the external conditions. This belief is neither bigotry norsuperstition, only an ever-present, instinctive feeling of the proximity ofanother spiritual and invisible world, which, though it be subjective to thesenses of the outward man, is perfectly objective to the inner ego. Furthermore,they believed that there are external and internal conditions which affect thedetermination of our will upon our actions. They rejected fatalism, for fatalismimplies a blind course of some still blinder power. But they believed indestiny, which from birth to death every man is weaving thread by thread aroundhimself, as a spider does his cobweb; and this destiny is guided either by thatpresence termed by some the guardian angel, or our more intimate astral innerman, who is but too often the evil genius of the man of flesh. Both these leadon the outward man, but one of them must prevail; and from the very beginning ofthe invisible affray the stern and implacable law of compensation steps in andtakes its course, following faithfully the fluctuations. When the last strand iswoven, and man is seemingly enwrapped in the net-work of his own doing, then hefinds himself completely under the empire of this self-made destiny. It theneither fixes him like the inert shell against the immovable rock, or like afeather carries him away in a whirlwind raised by his own actions. The greatest philosophers of antiquity found it neither unreasonable nor strangethat \"souls should come to souls, and impart to them conceptions of futurethings, occasionally by letters, or by a mere touch, or by a glance reveal tothem past events or announce future ones,\" as Ammonius tells us. Moreover,Lamprias and others held that if the unembodied spirits or souls could descendon earth and become guardians of mortal men, \"we should not seek to deprivethose souls which are still in the body of that power by which the former knowfuture events and are able to announce them. It is not probable,\" adds Lamprias,\"that the soul gains a new power of prophecy after separation from the body, andwhich before it did not possess. We may rather conclude that it possessed allthese powers during its union with the body, although in a lesser perfection. .. . For as the sun does not shine only when it passes from among the clouds, buthas always been radiant and has only appeared dim and obscured by vapors, thesoul does not only receive the power of looking into futurity when it passesfrom the body as from a cloud, but has possessed it always, though dimmed byconnection with the earthly.\" A familiar example of one phase of the power of the soul or astral body tomanifest itself, is the phenomenon of the so-called spirit-hand. In the presenceof certain mediums these seemingly detached members will gradually develop froma luminous nebula, pick up a pencil, write messages, and then dissolve beforethe eyes of the witnesses. Many such cases are recorded by perfectly competentand trustworthy persons. These phenomena are real, and require seriousconsideration. But false \"phantom-hands\" have sometimes been taken for thegenuine. At Dresden we once saw a hand and arm, made for the purpose ofdeception, with an ingenious arrangement of springs that would cause the machineto imitate to perfection the movements of the natural member; while exteriorlyit would require close inspection to detect its artificial character. In usingthis, the dishonest medium slips his natural arm out of his sleeve, and replacesit with the mechanical substitute; both hands may then be made to seem restingupon the table, while in fact one is touching the sitters, showing itself,knocking the furniture, and making other phenomena. The mediums for real manifestations are least able, as a rule, to comprehend orexplain them. Among those who have written most intelligently upon the subjectof these luminous hands, may be reckoned Dr. Francis Gerry Fairfield, author ofTen Years among the Mediums, an article from whose pen appears in the LibraryTable for July 19, 1877. A medium himself, he is yet a strong opponent of thespiritualistic theory. Discussing the subject of the \"phantom-hand,\" hetestifies that \"this the writer has personally witnessed, under conditions oftest provided by himself, in his own room, in full daylight, with the mediumseated upon a sofa from six to eight feet from the table hovering upon which theapparition (the hand) appeared. The application of the poles of a horse-shoemagnet to the hand caused it to waver perceptibly, and threw the medium intoviolent convulsions--pretty positive evidence that the force concerned in thephenomenon was generated in his own nervous system.\" Dr. Fairfield's deduction that the fluttering phantom-hand is an emanation fromthe medium is logical, and it is correct. The test of the horse-shoe magnetproves in a scientific way what every kabalist would affirm upon the authorityof experience, no less than philosophy. The \"force concerned in the phenomenon\"is the will of the medium, exercised unconsciously to the outer man, which forthe time is semi-paralyzed and cataleptic; the phantom-hand an extrusion of theman's inner or astral member. This is that real self whose limbs the surgeoncannot amputate, but remain behind after the outer casing is cut off, and (alltheories of exposed or compressed nerve termini to the contrary,notwithstanding) have all the sensations the physical parts formerlyexperienced. This is that spiritual (astral) body which \"is raised inincorruption.\" It is useless to argue that these are spirit-hands; for,admitting even that at every seance human spirits of many kinds are attracted tothe medium, and that they do guide and produce some manifestations, yet to makehands or faces objective they are compelled to use either the astral limbs ofthe medium, or the materials furnished them by the elementals, or yet thecombined aural emanations of all persons present. Pure spirits will not andcannot show themselves objectively; those that do are not pure spirits, butelementary and impure. Woe to the medium who falls a prey to such! The same principle involved in the unconscious extrusion of a phantom limb bythe cataleptic medium, applies to the projection of his entire \"double\" orastral body. This may be withdrawn by the will of the medium's own inner self,without his retaining in his physical brain any recollection of such anintent--that is one phase of man's dual capacity. It may also be effected byelementary and elemental spirits, to whom he may stand in the relation ofmesmeric subject. Dr. Fairfield is right in one position taken in his book,viz.: mediums are usually diseased, and in many if not most cases the childrenor near connections of mediums. But he is wholly wrong in attributing allpsychical phenomena to morbid physiological conditions. The adepts of Easternmagic are uniformly in perfect mental and bodily health, and in fact thevoluntary and independent production of phenomena is impossible to any others.We have known many, and never a sick man among them. The adept retains perfectconsciousness; shows no change of bodily temperature, or other sign ofmorbidity; requires no \"conditions,\" but will do his feats anywhere andeverywhere; and instead of being passive and in subjection to a foreigninfluence, rules the forces with iron will. But we have elsewhere shown that themedium and the adept are as opposed as the poles. We will only add here that thebody, soul, and spirit of the adept are all conscious and working in harmony,and the body of the medium is an inert clod, and even his soul may be away in adream while its habitation is occupied by another. An adept can not only project and make visible a hand, a foot, or any otherportion of his body, but the whole of it. We have seen one do this, in full day,while his hands and feet were being held by a skeptical friend whom he wished tosurprise. * Little by little the whole astral body oozed out like a vaporycloud, until before us stood two forms, of which the second was an exactduplicate of the first, only slightly more shadowy. The medium need not exercise any will-power. It suffices that she or he shallknow what is expected by the investigators. The medium's \"spiritual\" entity,when not obsessed by other spirits, will act outside the will or consciousnessof the physical being, as surely as it acts when within the body during a fit ofsomnambulism. Its perceptions, external and internal, will be acuter and farmore developed, precisely as they are in the sleep-walker. And this is why \"thematerialized form sometimes knows more than the medium,\" ** for the intellectualperception of the astral entity is proportionately as much higher than thecorporeal intelligence of the medium in its normal state, as the spirit entityis finer than itself. Generally the medium will be found cold, the pulse willhave visibly changed, and a state of nervous prostration succeeds the phenomena,bunglingly and without discrimination attributed to disembodied spirits;whereas, but one-third of them may be produced by the latter, another third byelementals, and the rest by the astral double of the medium himself. But, while it is our firm belief that most of the physical manifestations, i.e.,those which neither need nor show intelligence nor great discrimination, areproduced mechanically by the scin-lecca (double) of the medium, as a person insound sleep will when apparently awake do things of which he will retain noremembrance. The purely subjective phenomena are but in a very small proportionof cases due to the action of the personal astral body. They are mostly, andaccording to the moral, intellectual, and physical purity of the medium, thework of either the elementary, or sometimes very pure human spirits. Elementalshave naught to do with subjective manifestations. In rare cases it is the divinespirit of the medium himself that guides and produces them. As Baboo Peary Chand Mittra says, in a letter * to the President of the NationalAssociation of Spiritualists, Mr. Alexander Calder, ** \"a spirit is an essenceor power, and has no form. . . . The very idea of form implies 'materialism.'The spirits [astral souls, we should say] . . . can assume forms for a time, butform is not their permanent state. The more material is our soul, the morematerial is our conception of spirits.\" Epimenides, the Orphikos, was renowned for his \"sacred and marvellous nature,\"and for the faculty his soul possessed of quitting its body \" as long and asoften as it pleased.\" The ancient philosophers who have testified to thisability may be reckoned by dozens. Apollonius left his body at a moment'snotice, but it must be remembered Apollonius was an adept--a \"magician.\" Had hebeen simply a medium, he could not have performed such feats at will. Empedoclesof Agrigentum, the Pythagorean thaumaturgist, required no conditions to arrest awaterspout which had broken over the city. Neither did he need any to recall awoman to life, as he did. Apollonius used no darkened room in which to performhis aethrobatic feats. Vanishing suddenly in the air before the eyes of Domitianand a whole crowd of witnesses (many thousands), he appeared an hour after inthe grotto of Puteoli. But investigation would have shown that his physical bodyhaving become invisible by the concentration of akasa about it, he could walkoff unperceived to some secure retreat in the neighborhood, and an hour afterhis astral form appear at Puteoli to his friends, and seem to be the manhimself. No more did Simon Magus wait to be entranced to fly off in the air before theapostles and crowds of witnesses. \"It requires no conjuration and ceremonies;circle-making and incensing are mere nonsense and juggling,\" says Paracelsus.The human spirit \"is so great a thing that no man can express it; as God Himselfis eternal and unchangeable, so also is the mind of man. If we rightlyunderstood its powers, nothing would be impossible to us on earth. Theimagination is strengthened and developed through faith in our will. Faith mustconfirm the imagination, for faith establishes the will.\" A singular account of the personal interview of an English ambassador in 1783,with a reincarnated Buddha--barely mentioned in volume i.--an infant of eighteenmonths old at that time, is given in the Asiatic Journal from the narrative ofan eye-witness himself, Mr. Turner, the author of The Embassy to Thibet. Thecautious phraseology of a skeptic dreading public ridicule ill conceals theamazement of the witness, who, at the same time, desires to give facts astruthfully as possible. The infant lama received the ambassador and his suitewith a dignity and decorum so natural and unconstrained that they remained in aperfect maze of wonder. The behavior of this infant, says the author, was thatof an old philosopher, grave and sedate and exceedingly courteous. He contrivedto make the young pontiff understand the inconsolable grief into which theGovernor-General of Galagata (Calcutta) the City of Palaces and the people ofIndia were plunged when he died, and the general rapture when they found that hehad resurrected in a young and fresh body again; at which compliment the younglama regarded him and his suite with looks of singular complacency, andcourteously treated them to confectionery from a golden cup. \"The ambassadorcontinued to express the Governor-General's hope that the lama might longcontinue to illumine the world with his presence, and that the friendship whichhad heretofore subsisted between them might be yet more strongly cemented, forthe benefit and advantage of the intelligent votaries of the lama . . . allwhich made the little creature look steadfastly at the speaker, and graciouslybow and nod--and bow and nod--as if he understood and approved of every wordthat was uttered.\" * As if he understood! If the infant behaved in the most natural and dignified wayduring the reception, and \"when their cups were empty of tea became uneasy andthrowing back his head and contracting the skin of his brow, continued making anoise till they were filled again,\" why could he not understand as well what wassaid to him? Years ago, a small party of travellers were painfully journeying from Kashmir toLeh, a city of Ladahk (Central Thibet). Among our guides we had a Tartar Shaman,a very mysterious personage, who spoke Russian a little and English not at all,and yet who managed, nevertheless, to converse with us, and proved of greatservice. Having learned that some of our party were Russians, he had imaginedthat our protection was all-powerful, and might enable him to safely find hisway back to his Siberian home, from which, for reasons unknown, some twentyyears before, he had fled, as he told us, via Kiachta and the great Gobi Desert,to the land of the Tcha-gars. * With such an interested object in view, webelieved ourselves safe under his guard. To explain the situation briefly: Ourcompanions had formed the unwise plan of penetrating into Thibet under variousdisguises, none of them speaking the language, although one, a Mr. K----, hadpicked up some Kasan Tartar, and thought he did. As we mention this onlyincidentally, we may as well say at once that two of them, the brothers N----,were very politely brought back to the frontier before they had walked sixteenmiles into the weird land of Eastern Bod; and Mr. K----, an ex-Lutheranminister, could not even attempt to leave his miserable village near Leh, asfrom the first days he found himself prostrated with fever, and had to return toLahore via Kashmere. But one sight seen by him was as good as if he hadwitnessed the reincarnation of Buddha itself. Having heard of this \"miracle\"from some old Russian missionary in whom he thought he could have more faiththan in Abbe Huc, it had been for years his desire to expose the \"great heathen\"jugglery, as he expressed it. K---- was a positivist, and rather prided himselfon this anti-philosophical neologism. But his positivism was doomed to receive adeath-blow. About four days journey from Islamabad, at an insignificant mud village, whoseonly redeeming feature was its magnificent lake, we stopped for a few days'rest. Our companions had temporarily separated from us, and the village was tobe our place of meeting. It was there that we were apprised by our Shaman that alarge party of Lamaic \"Saints,\" on pilgrimage to various shrines, had taken uptheir abode in an old cave-temple and established a temporary Vihara therein. Headded that, as the \"Three Honorable Ones\" ** were said to travel along withthem, the holy Bikshu (monks) were capable of producing the greatest miracles.Mr. K-----, fired with the prospect of exposing this humbug of the ages,proceeded at once to pay them a visit, and from that moment the most friendlyrelations were established between the two camps. The Vihar was in a secluded and most romantic spot secured against allintrusion. Despite the effusive attentions, presents, and protestations of Mr.K----, the Chief, who was Pase-Budhu (an ascetic of great sanctity), declined toexhibit the phenomenon of the \"incarnation\" until a certain talisman inpossession of the writer was exhibited. *Upon seeing this, however, preparationswere at once made, and an infant of three or four months was procured from itsmother, a poor woman of the neighborhood. An oath was first of all exacted ofMr. K----, that he would not divulge what he might see or hear, for the space ofseven years. The talisman is a simple agate or carnelian known among theThibetans and others as A-yu, and naturally possessed, or had been endowed withvery mysterious properties. It has a triangle engraved upon it, within which arecontained a few mystical words. ** Several days passed before everything was ready; nothing of a mysteriouscharacter occurring, meanwhile, except that, at the bidding of a Bikshu, ghastlyfaces were made to peep at us out of the glassy bosom of the lake, as we sat atthe door of the Vihar, upon its bank. One of these was the countenance of Mr.K----'s sister, whom he had left well and happy at home, but who, as wesubsequently learned, had died some time before he had set out on the presentjourney. The sight affected him at first, but he called his skepticism to hisaid, and quieted himself with theories of cloud-shadows, reflections oftree-branches, etc., such as people of his kind fall back upon. On the appointed afternoon, the baby being brought to the Vihara, was left inthe vestibule or reception-room, as K---- could go no further into the temporarysanctuary. The child was then placed on a bit of carpet in the middle of thefloor, and every one not belonging to the party being sent away, two\"mendicants\" were placed at the entrance to keep out intruders. Then all thelamas seated themselves on the floor, with their backs against the granitewalls, so that each was separated from the child by a space, at least, of tenfeet. The chief, having had a square piece of leather spread for him by thedesservant, seated himself at the farthest corner. Alone, Mr. K---- placedhimself close by the infant, and watched every movement with intense interest.The only condition exacted of us was that we should preserve a strict silence,and patiently await further developments. A bright sunlight streamed through theopen door. Gradually the \"Superior\" fell into what seemed a state of profoundmeditation, while the others, after a sotto voce short invocation, becamesuddenly silent, and looked as if they had been completely petrified. It wasoppressively still, and the crowing of the child was the only sound to be heard.After we had sat there a few moments, the movements of the infant's limbssuddenly ceased, and his body appeared to become rigid. K---- watched intentlyevery motion, and both of us, by a rapid glance, became satisfied that allpresent were sitting motionless. The superior, with his gaze fixed upon theground, did not even look at the infant; but, pale and motionless, he seemedrather like a bronze statue of a Talapoin in meditation than a living being.Suddenly, to our great consternation, we saw the child, not raise itself, but,as it were, violently jerked into a sitting posture! A few more jerks, and then,like an automaton set in motion by concealed wires, the four months' baby stoodupon his feet! Fancy our consternation, and, in Mr. K----'s case, horror. Not ahand had been outstretched, not a motion made, nor a word spoken; and yet, herewas a baby-in-arms standing erect and firm as a man! The rest of the story we will quote from a copy of notes written on this subjectby Mr. K----, the same evening, and given to us, in case it should not reach itsplace of destination, or the writer fail to see anything more. \"After a minute or two of hesitation,\" writes K----, \"the baby turned his headand looked at me with an expression of intelligence that was simply awful! Itsent a chill through me. I pinched my hands and bit my lips till the bloodalmost came, to make sure that I did not dream. But this was only the beginning.The miraculous creature, making, as I fancied, two steps toward me, resumed hissitting posture, and, without removing his eyes from mine, repeated, sentence bysentence, in what I supposed to be Thibetan language, the very words, which Ihad been told in advance, are commonly spoken at the incarnations of Buddha,beginning with 'I am Buddha; I am the old Lama; I am his spirit in a new body,'etc. I felt a real terror; my hair rose upon my head, and my blood ran cold. Formy life I could not have spoken a word. There was no trickery here, noventriloquism. The infant lips moved, and the eyes seemed to search my very soulwith an expression that made me think it was the face of the Superior himself,his eyes, his very look that I was gazing upon. It was as if his spirit hadentered the little body, and was looking at me through the transparent mask ofthe baby's face. I felt my brain growing dizzy. The infant reached toward me,and laid his little hand upon mine. I started as if I had been touched by a hotcoal; and, unable to bear the scene any longer, covered my face with my hands.It was but for an instant; but when I removed them, the little actor had becomea crowing baby again, and a moment after, lying upon his back, set up a fretfulcry. The superior had resumed his normal condition, and conversation ensued. \"It was only after a series of similar experiments, extending over ten days,that I realized the fact that I had seen the incredible, astounding phenomenondescribed by certain travellers, but always by me denounced as an imposture.Among a multitude of questions unanswered, despite my cross-examination, theSuperior let drop one piece of information, which must be regarded as highlysignificant. 'What would have happened,' I inquired, through the shaman, 'if,while the infant was speaking, in a moment of insane fright, at the thought ofits being the \"Devil,\" I had killed it?' He replied that, if the blow had notbeen instantly fatal, the child alone would have been killed.' 'But,' Icontinued, 'suppose that it had been as swift as a lightning-flash?' 'In suchcase,' was the answer, 'you would have killed me also.' \" In Japan and Siam there are two orders of priests, of which one are public, anddeal with the people, the other strictly private. The latter are never seen;their existence is known but to very few natives, never to foreigners. Theirpowers are never displayed in public, nor ever at all except on rare occasionsof the utmost importance, at which times the ceremonies are performed insubterranean or otherwise inaccessible temples, and in the presence of a chosenfew whose heads answer for their secrecy. Among such occasions are deaths in theRoyal family, or those of high dignitaries affiliated with the Order. One of themost weird and impressive exhibitions of the power of these magicians is that ofthe withdrawal of the astral soul from the cremated remains of human beings, aceremony practiced likewise in some of the most important lamaseries of Thibetand Mongolia. In Siam, Japan, and Great Tartary, it is the custom to make medallions,statuettes, and idols out of the ashes of cremated persons; *they are mixed withwater into a paste, and after being moulded into the desired shape, are bakedand then gilded. The Lamasery of Ou-Tay, in the province of Chan-Si, Mongolia,is the most famous for that work, and rich persons send the bones of theirdefunct relatives to be ground and fashioned there. When the adept in magicproposes to facilitate the withdrawal of the astral soul of the deceased, whichotherwise they think might remain stupefied for an indefinite period within theashes, the following process is resorted to: The sacred dust is placed in aheap, upon a metallic plate, strongly magnetized, of the size of a man's body.The adept then slowly and gently fans it with the Talapat Nang, ** a fan of apeculiar shape and inscribed with certain signs, muttering, at the same time, aform of invocation. The ashes soon become, as it were, imbued with life, andgently spread themselves out into a thin layer which assumes the outline of thebody before cremation. Then there gradually arises a sort of whitish vapor whichafter a time forms into an erect column, and compacting itself, is finallytransformed into the \"double,\" or ethereal, astral counterpart of the dead,which in its turn dissolves away into thin air, and disappears from mortalsight. *** The \"Magicians\" of Kashmir, Thibet, Mongolia, and Great Tartary are too wellknown to need comments. If jugglers they be, we invite the most expert jugglersof Europe and America to match them if they can. If our scientists are unable to imitate the mummy-embalming of the Egyptians,how much greater would be their surprise to see, as we have, dead bodiespreserved by alchemical art, so that after the lapse of centuries, they seem asthough the individuals were but sleeping. The complexions were as fresh, theskin as elastic, the eyes as natural and sparkling as though they were in thefull flush of health, and the wheels of life had been stopped but the instantbefore. The bodies of certain very eminent personages are laid upon catafalques,in rich mausoleums, sometimes overlaid with gilding or even with plates of realgold; their favorite arms, trinkets, and articles of daily use gathered aboutthem, and a suite of attendants, blooming young boys and girls, but stillcorpses, preserved like their masters, stand as if ready to serve when called.In the convent of Great Kouren, and in one situated upon the Holy Mountain(Bohte Oula) there are said to be several such sepulchres, which have beenrespected by all the conquering hordes that have swept through those countries.Abbe Huc heard that such exist, but did not see one, strangers of all kindsbeing excluded, and missionaries and European travellers not furnished with therequisite protection, being the last of all persons who would be permitted toapproach the sacred places. Huc's statement that the tombs of Tartar sovereignsare surrounded with children \"who were compelled to swallow mercury until theywere suffocated,\" by which means \"the color and freshness of the victims ispreserved so well that they appear alive,\" is one of these idle missionaryfables which impose only upon the most ignorant who accept on hearsay. Buddhistshave never immolated victims, whether human or animal. It is utterly against theprinciples of their religion, and no Lamaist was ever accused of it. When a richman desired to be interred in company, messengers were sent throughout thecountry with the Lama-embalmers, and children just dead in the natural way wereselected for the purpose. Poor parents were but too glad to preserve theirdeparted children in this poetic way, instead of abandoning them to decay andwild beasts. At the time when Abbe Huc was living in Paris, after his return from Thibet, herelated, among other unpublished wonders, to a Mr. Arsenieff, a Russiangentleman, the following curious fact that he had witnessed during his longsojourn at the lamasery of Kounboum. One day while conversing with one of thelamas, the latter suddenly stopped speaking, and assumed the attentive attitudeof one who is listening to a message being delivered to him, although he (Huc)heard never a word. \"Then, I must go\"; suddenly broke forth the lama, as if inresponse to the message. \"Go where?\" inquired the astonished \"lama of Jehovah\" (Huc). \"And with whom areyou talking?\" \"To the lamasery of ******\" was the quiet answer. \"The Shaberon wants me; it washe who summoned me.\" Now this lamasery was many days' journey from that of Kounboum, in which theconversation was taking place. But what seemed to astonish Huc the most was,that, instead of setting off on his journey, the lama simply walked to a sort ofcupola-room on the roof of the house in which they lived, and another lama,after exchanging a few words, followed them to the terrace by means of theladder, and passing between them, locked and barred his companion in. Thenturning to Huc after a few seconds of meditation, he smiled and informed theguest that \"he had gone.\" \"But how could he? Why you have locked him in, and the room has no issue?\"insisted the missionary. \"And what good would a door be to him?\" answered the custodian. \"It is hehimself who went away; his body is not needed, and so he left it in my charge.\" Notwithstanding the wonders which Huc had witnessed during his perilous journey,his opinion was that both of the lamas had mystified him. But three days later,not having seen his habitual friend and entertainer, he inquired after him, andwas informed that he would be back in the evening. At sunset, and just as the\"other lamas\" were preparing to retire, Huc heard his absent friend's voicecalling as if from the clouds, to his companion to open the door for him.Looking upward, he perceived the \"traveller's\" outline behind the lattice of theroom where he had been locked in. When he descended he went straight to theGrand Lama of Kounboum, and delivered to him certain messages and \"orders,\" fromthe place which he \"pretended\" he had just left. Huc could get no moreinformation from him as to his aerial voyage. But he always thought, he said,that this \"farce\" had something to do with the immediate and extraordinarypreparations for the polite expulsion of both the missionaries, himself andFather Gabet, to Chogor-tan, a place belonging to the Kounboum. The suspicion ofthe daring missionary may have been correct, in view of his impudentinquisitiveness and indiscretion. If the Abbe had been versed in Eastern philosophy, he would have found no greatdifficulty in comprehending both the flight of the lama's astral body to thedistant lamasery while his physical frame remained behind, or the carrying on ofa conversation with the Shaberon that was inaudible to himself. The recentexperiments with the telephone in America, to which allusion was made in ChapterV. of our first volume, but which have been greatly perfected since those pageswent to press, prove that the human voice and the sounds of instrumental musicmay be conveyed along a telegraphic wire to a great distance. The Hermeticphilosophers taught, as we have seen, that the disappearance from sight of aflame does not imply its actual extinction. It has only passed from the visibleto the invisible world, and may be perceived by the inner sense of vision, whichis adapted to the things of that other and more real universe. The same ruleapplies to sound. As the physical ear discerns the vibrations of the atmosphereup to a certain point, not yet definitely fixed, but varying with theindividual, so the adept whose interior hearing has been developed, can take thesound at this vanishing-point, and hear its vibrations in the astral lightindefinitely. He needs no wires, helices, or sounding-boards; his will-power isall-sufficient. Hearing with the spirit, time and distance offer no impediments,and so he may converse with another adept at the antipodes with as great ease asthough they were in the same room. Fortunately, we can produce numerous witnesses to corroborate our statement,who, without being adepts at all, have, nevertheless, heard the sound of aerialmusic and of the human voice, when neither instrument nor speaker were withinthousands of miles of the place where we sat. In their case they actually heardinteriorly, though they supposed their physical organs of hearing alone wereemployed. The adept had, by a simple effort of will-power, given them for thebrief moment the same perception of the spirit of sound as he himself constantlyenjoys. If our men of science could only be induced to test instead of deriding theancient philosophy of the trinity of all the natural forces, they would go byleaps toward the dazzling truth, instead of creeping, snail-like, as at present.Prof. Tyndall's experiments off the South Foreland, at Dover, in 1875, fairlyupset all previous theories of the transmission of sound, and those he has madewith sensitive flames * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu111.htm#fn_1146]bring him to the very threshold of arcane science. One step further, and hewould comprehend how adepts can converse at great distances. But that step willnot be taken. Of his sensitive--in truth, magical--flame, he says: \"Theslightest tap on a distant anvil causes it to fall to seven inches. When a bunchof keys is shaken, the flame is violently agitated, and emits a loud roar. Thedropping of a sixpence into a hand already containing coin, knocks the flamedown. The creaking of boots sets it in violent commotion. The crumpling ortearing of a bit of paper, or the rustle of a silk dress does the same.Responsive to every tick of a watch held near it, it falls and explodes. Thewinding up of a watch produces tumult. From a distance of thirty yards we maychirrup to this flame, and cause it to fall and roar. Repeating a passage fromthe Faerie Queene, the flame sifts and selects the manifold sounds of my voice,noticing some by a slight nod, others by a deeper bow, while to others itresponds by violent agitation.\" Such are the wonders of modern physical science; but at what cost of apparatus,and carbonic acid and coal gas; of American and Canadian whistles, trumpets,gongs, and bells! The poor heathen have none such impedimenta, but--willEuropean science believe it--nevertheless, produce the very same phenomena. Uponone occasion, when, in a case of exceptional importance, an \"oracle\" wasrequired, we saw the possibility of what we had previously vehementlydenied--namely, a simple mendicant cause a sensitive flame to give responsiveflashes without a particle of apparatus. A fire was kindled of branches of theBeal-tree, and some sacrificial herbs were sprinkled upon it. The mendicant satnear by, motionless, absorbed in contemplation. During the intervals between thequestions the fire burned low and seemed ready to go out, but when theinterrogatories were propounded, the flames leaped, roaring, skyward, flickered,bowed, and sent fiery tongues flaring toward the east, west, north, or south;each motion having its distinct meaning in a code of signals well understood.Between whiles it would sink to the ground, and the tongues of flame would lickthe sod in every direction, and suddenly disappear, leaving only a bed ofglowing embers. When the interview with the flame-spirits was at an end, theBikshu (mendicant) turned toward the jungle where he abode, keeping up awailing, monotonous chant, to the rhythm of which the sensitive flame kept time,not merely like Prof. Tyndall's, when he read the Faerie Queene, by simplemotions, but by a marvellous modulation of hissing and roaring until he was outof sight. Then, as if its very life were extinguished, it vanished, and left abed of ashes before the astonished spectators. Both in Western and Eastern Thibet, as in every other place where Buddhismpredominates, there are two distinct religions, the same as it is inBrahmanism--the secret philosophy and the popular religion. The former is thatof the followers of the doctrine of the sect of the Sutrantika. * They closelyadhere to the spirit of Buddha's original teachings which show the necessity ofintuitional perception, and all deductions therefrom. These do not proclaimtheir views, nor allow them to be made public. \"All compounds are perishable,\" were the last words uttered by the lips of thedying Gautama, when preparing under the Sal-tree to enter into Nirvana. \"Spiritis the sole, elementary, and primordial unity, and each of its rays is immortal,infinite, and indestructible. Beware of the illusions of matter.\" Buddhism wasspread far and wide over Asia, and even farther, by Dharm-Asoka. He was thegrandson of the miracle-worker Chandragupta, the illustrious king who rescuedthe Punjab from the Macedonians--if they ever were at Punjab at all--andreceived Megasthenes at his court in Pataliputra. Dharm-Asoka was the greatestKing of the Maurya dynasty. From a reckless profligate and atheist, he hadbecome Pryadasi, the \"beloved of the gods,\" and never was the purity of hisphilanthropic views surpassed by any earthly ruler. His memory has lived forages in the hearts of the Buddhists, and has been perpetuated in the humaneedicts engraved in several popular dialects on the columns and rocks ofAllahabad, Delhi, Guzerat, Peshawur, Orissa, and other places. *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu111.htm#fn_1148] His famous grandfatherhad united all India under his powerful sceptre. When the Nagas, orserpent-worshippers of Kashmere had been converted through the efforts of theapostles sent out by the Sthaviras of the third councils, the religion ofGautama spread like wild-fire. Gandhara, Cabul, and even many of the Satrapiesof Alexander the Great, accepted the new philosophy. The Buddhism of Nepal beingthe one which may be said to have diverged less than any other from the primevalancient faith, the Lamaism of Tartary, Mongolia, and Thibet, which is a directoffshoot of this country, may be thus shown to be the purest Buddhism; for wesay it again, Lamaism properly is but an external form of rites. The Upasakas and Upasakis, or male and female semi-monastics and semi-laymen,have equally with the lama-monks themselves, to strictly abstain from violatingany of Buddha's rules, and must study Meipo and every psychological phenomenonas much. Those who become guilty of any of the \"five sins\" lose all right tocongregate with the pious community. The most important of these is not to curseupon any consideration, for the curse returns upon the one that utters it, andoften upon his innocent relatives who breathe the same atmosphere with him. Tolove each other, and even our bitterest enemies; to offer our lives even foranimals, to the extent of abstaining from defensive arms; to gain the greatestof victories by conquering one's self; to avoid all vices; to practice allvirtues, especially humility and mildness; to be obedient to superiors, tocherish and respect parents, old age, learning, virtuous and holy men; toprovide food, shelter, and comfort for men and animals; to plant trees on theroads and dig wells for the comfort of travellers; such are the moral duties ofBuddhists. Every Ani or Bikshuni (nun) is subjected to these laws. Numerous are the Buddhist and Lamaic saints who have been renowned for theunsurpassed sanctity of their lives and their \"miracles.\" So Tissu, theEmperor's spiritual teacher, who consecrated Kublai-Khan, the Nadir Shah, wasknown far and wide as much for the extreme holiness of his life as for the manywonders he wrought. But he did not stop at fruitless miracles, but did betterthan that. Tissu purified completely his religion; and from one single provinceof Southern Mongolia is said to have forced Kublai to expel from convents500,000 monkish impostors, who made a pretext of their profession, to live invice and idleness. Then the Lamaists had their great reformer, the ShaberonSon-Ka-po, who is claimed to have been immaculately conceived by his mother, avirgin from Koko-nor (fourteenth century), who is another wonder-worker. Thesacred tree of Kounboum, the tree of the 10,000 images, which, in consequence ofthe degeneration of the true faith had ceased budding for several centuries, nowshot forth new sprouts and bloomed more vigorously than ever from the hair ofthis avatar of Buddha, says the legend. The same tradition makes him (Son-Ka-po)ascend to heaven in 1419. Contrary to the prevailing idea, few of these saintsare Khubilhans, or Shaberons--reincarnations. Many of the lamaseries contain schools of magic, but the most celebrated is thecollegiate monastery of the Shu-tukt, where there are over 30,000 monks attachedto it, the lamasery forming quite a little city. Some of the female nuns possessmarvellous psychological powers. We have met some of these women on their wayfrom Lha-Ssa to Candi, the Rome of Buddhism, with its miraculous shrines andGautama's relics. To avoid encounters with Mussulmans and other sects theytravel by night alone, unarmed, and without the least fear of wild animals, forthese will not touch them. At the first glimpses of dawn, they take refuge incaves and viharas prepared for them by their co-religionists at calculateddistances; for notwithstanding the fact that Buddhism has taken refuge inCeylon, and nominally there are but few of the denomination in British India,yet the secret Byauds (Brotherhoods) and Buddhist viharas are numerous, andevery Jain feels himself obliged to help, indiscriminately, Buddhist or Lamaist. Ever on the lookout for occult phenomena, hungering after sights, one of themost interesting that we have seen was produced by one of these poor travellingBikshu. It was years ago, and at a time when all such manifestations were new tothe writer. We were taken to visit the pilgrims by a Buddhist friend, a mysticalgentleman born at Kashmir, of Katchi parents, but a Buddha-Lamaist byconversion, and who generally resides at Lha-Ssa. \"Why carry about this bunch of dead plants?\" inquired one of the Bikshuni, anemaciated, tall and elderly woman, pointing to a large nosegay of beautiful,fresh, and fragrant flowers in the writer's hands. \"Dead?\" we asked, inquiringly. \"Why they just have been gathered in the garden?\" \"And yet, they are dead,\" she gravely answered. \"To be born in this world, isthis not death? See, how these herbs look when alive in the world of eternallight, in the gardens of our blessed Foh?\" Without moving from the place where she was sitting on the ground, the Ani tooka flower from the bunch, laid it in her lap, and began to draw together, bylarge handfuls as it were, invisible material from the surrounding atmosphere.Presently a very, very faint nodule of vapor was seen, and this slowly tookshape and color, until, poised in mid-air, appeared a copy of the bloom we hadgiven her. Faithful to the last tint and the last petal it was, and lying on itsside like the original, but a thousand-fold more gorgeous in hue and exquisitein beauty, as the glorified human spirit is more beauteous than its physicalcapsule. Flower after flower to the minutest herb was thus reproduced and madeto vanish, reappearing at our desire, nay, at our simple thought. Havingselected a full-blown rose we held it at arm's length, and in a few minutes ourarm, hand, and the flower, perfect in every detail, appeared reflected in thevacant space, about two yards from where we sat. But while the flower seemedimmeasurably beautified and as ethereal as the other spirit flowers, the arm andhand appeared like a mere reflection in a looking-glass, even to a large spot onthe fore arm, left on it by a piece of damp earth which had stuck to one of theroots. Later we learned the reason why. A great truth was uttered some fifty years ago by Dr. Francis Victor Broussais,when he said: \"If magnetism were true, medicine would be an absurdity.\"Magnetism is true, and so we shall not contradict the learned Frenchman as tothe rest. Magnetism, as we have shown, is the alphabet of magic. It is idle forany one to attempt to understand either the theory or the practice of the latteruntil the fundamental principle of magnetic attractions and repulsionsthroughout nature is recognized. Many so-called popular superstitions are but evidences of an instinctiveperception of this law. An untutored people are taught by the experience of manygenerations that certain phenomena occur under fixed conditions; they give theseconditions and obtain the expected results. Ignorant of the laws, they explainthe fact by supernaturalism, for experience has been their sole teacher. In India, as well as in Russia and some other countries, there is an instinctiverepugnance to stepping across a man's shadow, especially if he have red hair;and in the former country, natives are extremely reluctant to shake hands withpersons of another race. These are not idle fancies. Every person emits amagnetic exhalation or aura, and a man may be in perfect physical health, but atthe same time his exhalation may have a morbific character for others, sensitiveto such subtile influences. Dr. Esdaile and other mesmerists long since taughtus that Oriental people, especially Hindus, are more susceptible than thewhite-skinned races. Baron Reichenbach's experiments--and, in fact, the world'sentire experience--prove that these magnetic exhalations are most intense fromthe extremities. Therapeutic manipulations show this; hand-shaking is,therefore, most calculated to communicate antipathetic magnetic conditions, andthe Hindus do wisely in keeping their ancient \"superstition\"--derived fromManu--constantly in mind. The magnetism of a red-haired man, we have found, in almost every nation, isinstinctively dreaded. We might quote proverbs from the Russian, Persian,Georgian, Hindustani, French, Turkish, and even German, to show that treacheryand other vices are popularly supposed to accompany the rufous complexion. Whena man stands exposed to the sun, the magnetism of that luminary causes hisemanations to be projected toward the shadow, and the increased molecular actiondevelops more electricity. Hence, an individual to whom he isantipathetic--though neither might be sensible of the fact--would act prudentlyin not passing through the shadow. Careful physicians wash their hands uponleaving each patient; why, then, should they not be charged with superstition,as well as the Hindus? The sporules of disease are invisible, but no less real,as European experience demonstrates. Well, Oriental experience for a hundredcenturies has shown that the germs of moral contagion linger about localities,and impure magnetism can be communicated by the touch. Another prevalent belief in some parts of Russia, particularly Georgia(Caucasus), and in India, is that in case the body of a drowned person cannot beotherwise found, if a garment of his be thrown into the water it will floatuntil directly over the spot, and then sink. We have even seen the experimentsuccessfully tried with the sacred cord of a Brahman. It floated hither andthither, circling about as though in search of something, until suddenly dartingin a straight line for about fifty yards, it sank, and at that exact spot thedivers brought up the body. We find this \"superstition\" even in America. APittsburg paper, of very recent date, describes the finding of the body of ayoung boy, named Reed, in the Monongahela, by a like method. All other meanshaving failed, it says, \"a curious superstition was employed. One of the boy'sshirts was thrown into the river where he had gone down, and, it is said,floated on the surface for a time, and finally settled to the bottom at acertain place, which proved to be the resting-place of the body, and which wasthen drawn out. The belief that the shirt of a drowned person when thrown intothe water will follow the body is well-spread, absurd as it appears.\" This phenomenon is explained by the law of the powerful attraction existingbetween the human body and objects that have been long worn upon it. The oldestgarment is most effective for the experiment; a new one is useless. From time immemorial, in Russia, in the month of May, on Trinity Day, maidensfrom city and village have been in the habit of casting upon the river wreathsof green leaves--which each girl has to form for herself--and consulting theiroracles. If the wreath sinks, it is a sign that the girl will die unmarriedwithin a short time; if it floats, she will be married, the time depending uponthe number of verses she can repeat during the experiment. We positively affirmthat we have personal knowledge of several cases, two of them our intimatefriends, where the augury of death proved true, and the girls died within twelvemonths. Tried on any other day than Trinity, the result would doubtless be thesame. The sinking of the wreath is attributable to its being impregnated withthe unhealthy magnetism of a system which contains the germs of early death;such magnetisms having an attraction for the earth at the bottom of the stream.As for the rest, we are willing to abandon it to the friends of coincidence. The same general remark as to superstition having a scientific basis applies tothe phenomena produced by fakirs and jugglers, which skeptics heap into thecommon category of trickery. And yet, to a close observer, even to theuninitiated, an enormous difference is presented between the kimiya (phenomenon)of a fakir, and the batte-bazi (jugglery) of a trickster, and the necromancy ofa jadugar, or sahir, so dreaded and despised by the natives. This difference,imperceptible--nay incomprehensible--to the skeptical European, is instinctivelyappreciated by every Hindu, whether of high or low caste, educated or ignorant.The kangalin, or witch, who uses her terrible abhi-char (mesmeric powers) withintent to injure, may expect death at any moment, for every Hindu finds itlawful to kill her; a bukka-baz, or juggler, serves to amuse. A serpent-charmer,with his ba-ini full of venomous snakes, is less dreaded, for his powers offascination extend but to animals and reptiles; he is unable to charm humanbeings, to perform that which is called by the natives mantar phunkna, to throwspells on men by magic. But with the yogi, the sannyasi, the holy men whoacquire enormous psychological powers by mental and physical training, thequestion is totally different. Some of these men are regarded by the Hindus asdemi-gods. Europeans cannot judge of these powers but in rare and exceptionalcases. The British resident who has encountered in the maidans and public places whathe regards as frightful and loathsome human beings, sitting motionless in theself-inflicted torture of the urddwa bahu, with arms raised above the head formonths, and even years, need not suppose they are the wonder-working fakirs. Thephenomenon of the latter are visible only through the friendly protection of aBrahman, or under peculiarly fortuitous circumstances. Such men are as littleaccessible as the real Nautch girls, of whom every traveller talks, but very fewhave actually seen, since they belong exclusively to the pagodas. It is surpassingly strange, that with the thousands of travellers and themillions of European residents who have been in India, and have traversed it inevery direction, so little is yet known of that country and the lands whichsurround it. It may be that some readers will feel inclined not merely to doubtthe correctness but even openly contradict our statement? Doubtless, we will beanswered that all that it is desirable to know about India is already known? Infact this very reply was once made to us personally. That resident Anglo-Indiansshould not busy themselves with inquiries is not strange; for, as a Britishofficer remarked to us upon one occasion, \"society does not consider itwell-bred to care about Hindus or their affairs, or even show astonishment ordesire information upon anything they may see extraordinary in that country.\"But it really surprises us that at least travellers should not have exploredmore than they have this interesting realm. Hardly fifty years ago, inpenetrating the jungles of the Blue or Neilgherry Hills in Southern Hindustan, astrange race, perfectly distinct in appearance and language from any other Hindupeople, was discovered by two courageous British officers who weretiger-hunting. Many surmises, more or less absurd, were set on foot, and themissionaries, always on the watch to connect every mortal thing with the Bible,even went so far as to suggest that this people was one of the lost tribes ofIsrael, supporting their ridiculous hypothesis upon their very fair complexionsand \"strongly-marked Jewish features.\" The latter is perfectly erroneous, theTodas, as they are called, not bearing the remotest likeness to the Jewish type;either in feature, form, action, or language. They closely resemble each other,and, as a friend of ours expresses himself, the handsomest of the Todas resemblethe statue of the Grecian Zeus in majesty and beauty of form more than anythinghe had yet seen among men. Fifty years have passed since the discovery; but though since that time townshave been built on these hills and the country has been invaded by Europeans, nomore has been learned of the Todas than at the first. Among the foolish rumorscurrent about this people, the most erroneous are those in relation to theirnumbers and to their practicing polyandry. The general opinion about them isthat on account of the latter custom their number has dwindled to a few hundredfamilies, and the race is fast dying out. We had the best means of learning muchabout them, and therefore state most positively that the Todas neither practicepolyandry nor are they as few in number as supposed. We are ready to show thatno one has ever seen children belonging to them. Those that may have been seenin their company have belonged to the Badagas, a Hindu tribe totally distinctfrom the Todas, in race, color, and language, and which includes the most direct\"worshippers\" of this extraordinary people. We say worshippers, for the Badagasclothe, feed, serve, and positively look upon every Toda as a divinity. They aregiants in stature, white as Europeans, with tremendously long and generallybrown, wavy hair and beard, which no razor ever touched from birth. Handsome asa statue of Pheidias or Praxiteles, the Toda sits the whole day inactive, assome travellers who have had a glance at them affirm. From the many conflictingopinions and statements we have heard from the very residents of Ootakamund andother little new places of civilization scattered about the Neilgherry Hills, wecull the following: \"They never use water; they are wonderfully handsome and noble looking, butextremely unclean; unlike all other natives they despise jewelry, and never wearanything but a large black drapery or blanket of some woollen stuff, with acolored stripe at the bottom; they never drink anything but pure milk; they haveherds of cattle but neither eat their flesh, nor do they make their beasts oflabor plough or work; they neither sell nor buy; the Badagas feed and clothethem; they never use nor carry weapons, not even a simple stick; the Todas can'tread and won't learn. They are the despair of the missionaries and apparentlyhave no sort of religion, beyond the worship of themselves as the Lords ofCreation.\" * We will try to correct a few of these opinions, as far as we have learned from avery holy personage, a Brahmanam-guru, who has our great respect. Nobody has ever seen more than five or six of them at one time; they will nottalk with foreigners, nor was any traveller ever inside their peculiar long andflat huts, which apparently are without either windows or chimney and have butone door; nobody ever saw the funeral of a Toda, nor very old men among them;nor are they taken sick with cholera, while thousands die around them duringsuch periodical epidemics; finally, though the country all around swarms withtigers and other wild beasts, neither tiger, serpent, nor any other animal soferocious in those parts, was ever known to touch either a Toda or one of theircattle, though, as said above, they never use even a stick. Furthermore the Todas do not marry at all. They seem few in number, for no onehas or ever will have a chance of numbering them; as soon as their solitude wasprofaned by the avalanche of civilization--which was, perchance, due to theirown carelessness--the Todas began moving away to other parts as unknown and moreinaccessible than the Neilgherry hills had formerly been; they are not born ofToda mothers, nor of Toda parentage; they are the children of a certain veryselect sect, and are set apart from their infancy for special religiouspurposes. Recognized by a peculiarity of complexion, and certain other signs,such a child is known as what is vulgarly termed a Toda, from birth. Every thirdyear, each of them must repair to a certain place for a certain period of time,where each of them must meet; their \"dirt\" is but a mask, such as a sannyasiputs on in public in obedience to his vow; their cattle are, for the most part,devoted to sacred uses; and, though their places of worship have never beentrodden by a profane foot, they nevertheless exist, and perhaps rival the mostsplendid pagodas--goparams--known to Europeans. The Badagas are their specialvassals, and--as has been truly remarked--worship them as half-deities; fortheir birth and mysterious powers entitle them to such a distinction. The reader may rest assured that any statements concerning them, that clash withthe little that is above given, are false. No missionary will ever catch onewith his bait, nor any Badaga betray them, though he were cut to pieces. Theyare a people who fulfill a certain high purpose, and whose secrets areinviolable. Furthermore, the Todas are not the only such mysterious tribe in India. We havenamed several in a preceding chapter, but how many are there besides these, thatwill remain unnamed, unrecognized, and yet ever present! What is now generally known of Shamanism is very little; and that has beenperverted, like the rest of the non-Christian religions. It is called the\"heathenism\" of Mongolia, and wholly without reason, for it is one of the oldestreligions of India. It is spirit-worship, or belief in the immortality of thesouls, and that the latter are still the same men they were on earth, thoughtheir bodies have lost their objective form, and man has exchanged his physicalfor a spiritual nature. In its present shape, it is an offshoot of primitivetheurgy, and a practical blending of the visible with the invisible world.Whenever a denizen of earth desires to enter into communication with hisinvisible brethren, he has to assimilate himself to their nature, i.e., he meetsthese beings half-way, and, furnished by them with a supply of spiritualessence, endows them, in his turn, with a portion of his physical nature, thusenabling them sometimes to appear in a semi-objective form. It is a temporaryexchange of natures, called theurgy. Shamans are called sorcerers, because theyare said to evoke the \"spirits\" of the dead for purposes of necromancy. The trueShamanism--striking features of which prevailed in India in the days ofMegasthenes (300 B.C.)--can no more be judged by its degenerated scions amongthe Shamans of Siberia, than the religion of Gautama-Buddha can be interpretedby the fetishism of some of his followers in Siam and Burmah. It is in the chieflamaseries of Mongolia and Thibet that it has taken refuge; and there Shamanism,if so we must call it, is practiced to the utmost limits of intercourse allowedbetween man and \"spirit.\" The religion of the lamas has faithfully preserved theprimitive science of magic, and produces as great feats now as it did in thedays of Kublai-Khan and his barons. The ancient mystic formula of the KingSrong-ch-Tsans-Gampo, the \"Aum mani padme houm,\" * effects its wonders now aswell as in the seventh century. Avalokitesvara, highest of the threeBoddhisattvas, and patron saint of Thibet, projects his shadow, full in the viewof the faithful, at the lamasery of Dga-G'Dan, founded by him; and the luminousform of Son-Ka-pa, under the shape of a fiery cloudlet, that separates itselffrom the dancing beams of the sunlight, holds converse with a great congregationof lamas, numbering thousands; the voice descending from above, like the whisperof the breeze through foliage. Anon, say the Thibetans, the beautiful appearancevanishes in the shadows of the sacred trees in the park of the lamasery. At Garma-Khian (the mother-cloister) it is rumored that bad and unprogressedspirits are made to appear on certain days, and forced to give an account oftheir evil deeds; they are compelled by the lamaic adepts to redress the wrongsdone by them to mortals. This is what Huc naively terms \"personating evilspirits,\" i.e., devils. Were the skeptics of various European countriespermitted to consult the accounts printed daily ** at Moru, and in the \"City ofSpirits,\" of the business-like intercourse which takes place between the lamasand the invisible world, they would certainly feel more interest in thephenomena described so triumphantly in the spiritualistic journals. AtBuddha-Ila, or rather Foht-lla (Buddha's Mount), in the most important of themany thousand lamaseries of that country, the sceptre of the Boddhisgat is seenfloating, unsupported, in the air, and its motions regulate the actions of thecommunity. Whenever a lama is called to account in the presence of the Superiorof the monastery, he knows beforehand it is useless for him to tell an untruth;the \"regulator of justice\" (the sceptre) is there, and its waving motion, eitherapprobatory or otherwise, decides instantaneously and unerringly the question ofhis guilt. We do not pretend to have witnessed all this personally--we wish tomake no pretensions of any kind. Suffice it, with respect to any of thesephenomena, that what we have not seen with our own eyes has been sosubstantiated to us that we indorse its genuineness. A number of lamas in Sikkin produce meipo--\"miracle\"--by magical powers. Thelate Patriarch of Mongolia, Gegen Chutuktu, who resided at Urga, a veritableparadise, was the sixteenth incarnation of Gautama, therefore a Boddhisattva. Hehad the reputation of possessing powers that were phenomenal, even among thethaumaturgists of the land of miracles par excellence. Let no one suppose thatthese powers are developed without cost. The lives of most of these holy men,miscalled idle vagrants, cheating beggars, who are supposed to pass theirexistence in preying upon the easy credulity of their victims, are miracles inthemselves. Miracles, because they show what a determined will and perfectpurity of life and purpose are able to accomplish, and to what degree ofpreternatural ascetism a human body can be subjected and yet live and reach aripe old age. No Christian hermit has ever dreamed of such refinement ofmonastic discipline; and the aerial habitation of a Simon Stylite would appearchild's play before the fakir's and the Buddhist's inventions of will-tests. Butthe theoretical study of magic is one thing; the possibility of practicing itquite another. At Bras-ss-Pungs, the Mongolian college where over three hundredmagicians (sorciers, as the French missionaries call them) teach about twice asmany pupils from twelve to twenty, the latter have many years to wait for theirfinal initiation. Not one in a hundred reaches the highest goal; and out of themany thousand lamas occupying nearly an entire city of detached buildingsclustering around it, not more than two per cent. become wonder-workers. One maylearn by heart every line of the 108 volumes of Kadjur, * and still make but apoor practical magician. There is but one thing which leads surely to it, andthis particular study is hinted at by more than one Hermetic writer. One, theArabian alchemist Abipili, speaks thus: \"I admonish thee, whosoever thou artthat desirest to dive into the inmost parts of nature; if that thou seekest thoufindest not within thee, thou wilt never find it without thee. If thou knowestnot the excellency of thine own house, why dost thou seek after the excellencyof other things? . . . O MAN, KNOW THYSELF! IN THEE IS HID THE TREASURE OFTREASURES.\" In another alchemic tract, De manna Benedicto, the author expresses his ideas ofthe philosopher's stone, in the following terms: \"My intent is for certainreasons not to prate too much of the matter, which yet is but one only thing,already too plainly described; for it shows and sets down such magical andnatural uses of it [the stone] as many that have had it never knew nor heard of;and such as, when I beheld them, made my knees to tremble and my heart to shake,and I to stand amazed at the sight of them!\" Every neophyte has experienced more or less such a feeling; but once that it isovercome, the man is an ADEPT. Within the cloisters of Dshashi-Lumbo and Si-Dzang, these powers, inherent inevery man, called out by so few, are cultivated to their utmost perfection. Who,in India, has not heard of the Banda-Chan Ramboutchi, the Houtouktou of thecapital of Higher Thibet? His brotherhood of Khe-lan was famous throughout theland; and one of the most famous \"brothers\" was a Peh-ling (an Englishman) whohad arrived one day during the early part of this century, from the West, athorough Buddhist, and after a month's preparation was admitted among theKhe-lans. He spoke every language, including the Thibetan, and knew every artand science, says the tradition. His sanctity and the phenomena produced by himcaused him to be proclaimed a shaberon after a residence of but a few years. Hismemory lives to the present day among the Thibetans, but his real name is asecret with the shaberons alone. The greatest of the meipo--said to be the object of the ambition of everyBuddhist devotee--was, and yet is, the faculty of walking in the air. The famousKing of Siam, Pia Metak, the Chinese, was noted for his devotion and learning.But he attained this \"supernatural gift\" only after having placed himself underthe direct tuition of a priest of Gautama-Buddha. Crawfurd and Finlayson, duringtheir residence at Siam, followed with great interest the endeavors of someSiamese nobles to acquire this faculty. * Numerous and varied are the sects in China, Siam, Tartary, Thibet, Kashmir, andBritish India, which devote their lives to the cultivation of \"supernaturalpowers,\" so called. Discussing one of such sects, the Taosse, Semedo says: \"Theypretend that by means of certain exercises and meditations one shall regain hisyouth, and others will attain to be Shien-sien, i.e., 'Terrestrial Beati,' inwhose state every desire is gratified, whilst they have the power to transportthemselves from one place to another, however distant, with speed andfacility.\" * This faculty relates but to the projection of the astral entity, ina more or less corporealized form, and certainly not to bodily transportation.This phenomenon is no more a miracle than one's reflection in a looking-glass.No one can detect in such an image a particle of matter, and still there standsour double, faithfully representing, even to each single hair on our heads. If,by this simple law of reflection, our double can be seen in a mirror, how muchmore striking a proof of its existence is afforded in the art of photography! Itis no reason, because our physicists have not yet found the means of takingphotographs, except at a short distance, that the acquirement should beimpossible to those who have found these means in the power of the human willitself, freed from terrestrial concern. **[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu111.htm#fn_1155] Our thoughts are matter,says science; every energy produces more or less of a disturbance in theatmospheric waves. Therefore, as every man--in common with every other living,and even inert object--has an aura of his own emanations surrounding him; and,moreover, is enabled, by a trifling effort, to transport himself in imaginationwherever he likes, why is it scientifically impossible that his thought,regulated, intensified, and guided by that powerful magician, the educated WILL,may become corporealized for the time being, and appear to whom it likes, afaithful double of the original? Is the proposition, in the present state ofscience, any more unthinkable than the photograph or telegraph were less thanforty years ago, or the telephone less than fourteen months ago? If the sensitized plate can so accurately seize upon the shadow of our faces,then this shadow or reflection, although we are unable to perceive it, must besomething substantial. And, if we can, with the help of optical instruments,project our semblances upon a white wall, at several hundred feet distance,sometimes, then there is no reason why the adepts, the alchemists, the savantsof the secret art, should not have already found out that which scientists denyto-day, but may discover true tomorrow, i.e., how to project electrically theirastral bodies, in an instant, through thousands of miles of space, leaving theirmaterial shells with a certain amount of animal vital principle to keep thephysical life going, and acting within their spiritual, ethereal bodies assafely and intelligently as when clothed with the covering of flesh? There is ahigher form of electricity than the physical one known to experimenters; athousand correlations of the latter are as yet veiled to the eye of the modernphysicist, and none can tell where end its possibilities. Schott explains that by Sian or Shin-Sian are understood in the old Chineseconception, and particularly in that of the Tao-Kiao (Taosse) sect, \"persons whowithdraw to the hills to lead the life of anchorites, and who have attained,either through their ascetic observances or by the power of charms and elixirs,to the possession of miraculous gifts and of terrestrial immortality.\" * (?)This is exaggerated if not altogether erroneous. What they claim, is merelytheir ability to prolong human life; and they can do so, if we have to believehuman testimony. What Marco Polo testifies to in the thirteenth century iscorroborated in our own days. \"There are another class of people called Chughi\"(Yogi), he says, \"who are indeed properly called Abraiamans (Brahmans?) who areextremely long-lived, every man of them living to 150 or 200 years. They eatvery little, rice and milk chiefly. And these people make use of a very strangebeverage, a potion of sulphur and quicksilver mixed together, and this theydrink twice every month. . . . This, they say, gives them long life; and it is apotion they are used to take from their childhood.\" **Bernier shows, saysColonel Yule, the Yogis very skilful in preparing mercury \"so admirably that oneor two grains taken every morning restored the body to perfect health\"; and addsthat the mercurius vitae of Paracelsus was a compound in which entered antimonyand quicksilver. *** This is a very careless statement, to say the least, and wewill explain what we know of it. The longevity of some lamas and Talapoins is proverbial; and it is generallyknown that they use some compound which \"renews the old blood,\" as they call it.And it was equally a recognized fact with alchemists that a judiciousadministration, \"of aura of silver does restore health and prolongs life itselfto a wonderful extent.\" But we are fully prepared to oppose the statements ofboth Bernier and Col. Yule who quotes him, that it is mercury or quicksilverwhich the Yogis and the alchemists used. The Yogis, in the days of Marco Polo,as well as in our modern times, do use that which may appear to be quicksilver,but is not. Paracelsus, the alchemists, and other mystics, meant by mercuriusvitae, the living spirit of silver, the aura of silver, not the argent vive; andthis aura is certainly not the mercury known to our physicians and druggists.There can be no doubt that the imputation that Paracelsus introduced mercuryinto medical practice is utterly incorrect. No mercury, whether prepared by amediaeval fire-philosopher or a modern self-styled physician, can or ever didrestore the body to perfect health. Only an unmitigated charlatan ever will usesuch a drug. And it is the opinion of many that it is just with the wickedintention of presenting Paracelsus in the eyes of posterity as a quack, that hisenemies have invented such a preposterous lie. The Yogis of the olden times, as well as modern lamas and Talapoins, use acertain ingredient with a minimum of sulphur, and a milky juice which theyextract from a medicinal plant. They must certainly be possessed of somewonderful secrets, as we have seen them healing the most rebellious wounds in afew days; restoring broken bones to good use in as many hours as it would takedays to do by means of common surgery. A fearful fever contracted by the writernear Rangoon, after a flood of the Irrawaddy River, was cured in a few hours bythe juice of a plant called, if we mistake not, Kukushan, though there may bethousands of natives ignorant of its virtues who are left to die of fever. Thiswas in return for a trifling kindness we had done to a simple mendicant; aservice which can interest the reader but little. We have heard of a certain water, also, called ab-i-hayat, which the popularsuperstition thinks hidden from every mortal eye, except that of the holysannyasi; the fountain itself being known as the ab-i-haiwan-i. It is more thanprobable though, that the Talapoins will decline to deliver up their secrets,even to academicians and missionaries; as these remedies must be used for thebenefit of humanity, never for money. * At the great festivals of Hindu pagodas, at the marriage feasts of richhigh-castes, everywhere where large crowds are gathered, Europeans find guni--orserpent-charmers, fakirs-mesmerizers, thaum-working sannyasi, and so-called\"jugglers.\" To deride is easy--to explain, rather more troublesome--to scienceimpossible. The British residents of India and the travellers prefer the firstexpedient. But let any one ask one of these Thomases how the followingresults--which they cannot and do not deny--are produced? When crowds of guniand fakirs appear with their bodies encircled with cobras-de-capello, their armsornamented with bracelets of corallilos--diminutive snakes inflicting certaindeath in a few seconds--and their shoulders with necklaces of trigonocephali,the most terrible enemy of naked Hindu feet, whose bite kills like a flash oflightning, the sceptic witness smiles and gravely proceeds to explain how thesereptiles, having been thrown in cataleptic torpor, were all deprived by the guniof their fangs. \"They are harmless and it is ridiculous to fear them.\" \"Will theSaeb caress one of my nag?\" asked once a guni approaching our interlocutor, whohad been thus humbling his listeners with his herpetological achievements for afull half hour. Rapidly jumping back--the brave warrior's feet proving no lessnimble than his tongue--Captain B----'s angry answer could hardly beimmortalized by us in print. Only the guni's terrible body-guard saved him froman unceremonious thrashing. Besides, say a word, and for a half-roupee anyprofessional serpent-charmer will begin creeping about and summon around in afew moments numbers of untamed serpents of the most poisonous species, and willhandle them and encircle his body with them. On two occasions in theneighborhood of Trinkemal a serpent was ready to strike at the writer, who hadonce nearly sat on its tail, but both times, at a rapid whistle of the guni whomwe had hired to accompany us, it stopped--hardly a few inches from our body, asif arrested by lightning and slowly sinking its menacing head to the ground,remained stiff and motionless as a dead branch, under the charm of the kilna. * Will any European juggler, tamer, or even mesmerizer, risk repeating just oncean experiment that may be daily witnessed in India, if you know where to go tosee it? There is nothing in the world more ferocious than a royal Bengal tiger.Once the whole population of a small village, not far from Dakka, situated onthe confines of a jungle, was thrown into a panic at the appearance of anenormous tigress, at the dawn of the day. These wild beasts never leave theirdens but at night, when they go searching for prey and for water. But thisunusual circumstance was due to the fact that the beast was a mother, and shehad been deprived of her two cubs, which had been carried away by a daringhunter, and she was in search of them. Two men and a child had already becomeher victims, when an aged fakir, bent on his daily round, emerging from the gateof the pagoda, saw the situation and understood it at a glance. Chanting amantram he went straight to the beast, which with flaming eye and foaming mouthcrouched near a tree ready for a new victim. When at about ten feet from thetigress, without interrupting his modulated prayer, the words of which no laymancomprehends, he began a regular process of mesmerization, as we understood it;he made passes. A terrific howl which struck a chill into the heart of everyhuman being in the place, was then heard. This long, ferocious, drawling howlgradually subsided into a series of plaintive broken sobs, as if the bereavedmother was uttering her complaints, and then, to the terror of the crowd whichhad taken refuge on trees and in the houses, the beast made a tremendousleap--on the holy man as they thought. They were mistaken, she was at his feet,rolling in the dust, and writhing. A few moments more and she remainedmotionless, with her enormous head laid on her fore-paws, and her bloodshot butnow mild eye riveted on the face of the fakir. Then the holy man of prayers satbeside the tigress and tenderly smoothed her striped skin, and patted her back,until her groans became fainter and fainter, and half an hour later all thevillage was standing around this group; the fakir's head lying on the tigress'sback as on a pillow, his right hand on her head, and his left thrown on the sodunder the terrible mouth, from which the long red protruding tongue was gentlylicking it. This is the way the fakirs tame the wildest beasts in India. Can Europeantamers, with their white-hot iron rods, do as much? Of course every fakir is notendowed with such a power; comparatively very few are. And yet the actual numberis large. How they are trained to these requirements in the pagodas will remainan eternal secret, to all except the Brahmans and the adepts in occultmysteries. The stories, hitherto considered fables, of Christna and Orpheuscharming the wild beasts, thus receives its corroboration in our day. There isone fact which remains undeniable. There is not a single European in India whocould have, or has ever boasted of having, penetrated into the enclosedsanctuary within the pagodas. Neither authority nor money has ever induced aBrahman to allow an uninitiated foreigner to pass the threshold of the reservedprecinct. To use authority in such a case would be equivalent to throwing alighted taper into a powder magazine. The Hindus, mild, patient, long-suffering,whose very apathy saved the British from being driven out of the country in1857, would raise their hundred millions of devotees as one man, at such aprofanation; regardless of sects or castes, they would exterminate everyChristian. The East India Company knew this well and built her stronghold on thefriendship of the Brahmans, and by paying subsidy to the pagodas; and theBritish Government is as prudent as its predecessor. It is the castes, andnon-interference with the prevailing religions, that secure its comparativeauthority in India. But we must once more recur to Shamanism, that strange andmost despised of all surviving religions--\"Spirit-worship.\" Its followers have neither altars nor idols, and it is upon the authority of aShaman priest that we state that their true rites, which they are bound toperform only once a year, on the shortest day of winter, cannot take placebefore any stranger to their faith. Therefore, we are confident that alldescriptions hitherto given in the Asiatic Journal and other European works, arebut guess-work. The Russians, who, from constant intercourse with the Shamans inSiberia and Tartary, would be the most competent of all persons to judge oftheir religion, have learned nothing except of the personal proficiency of thesemen in what they are half inclined to believe clever jugglery. Many Russianresidents, though, in Siberia, are firmly convinced of the \"supernatural\" powersof the Shamans. Whenever they assemble to worship, it is always in an openspace, or a high hill, or in the hidden depths of a forest--in this reminding usof the old Druidical rites. Their ceremonies upon the occasions of births,deaths, and marriages are but trifling parts of their worship. They compriseofferings, the sprinkling of the fire with spirits and milk, and weird hymns, orrather, magical incantations, intoned by the officiating Shaman, and concludingwith a chorus of the persons present. The numerous small bells of brass and iron worn by them on the priestly robe ofdeerskin, * or the pelt of some other animal reputed magnetic, are used to driveaway the malevolent spirits of the air, a superstition shared by all the nationsof old, including Romans, and even the Jews, whose golden bells tell the story.They have iron staves also covered with bells, for the same reason. When, aftercertain ceremonies, the desired crisis is reached, and \"the spirit has spoken,\"and the priest (who may be either male or female) feels its overpoweringinfluence, the hand of the Shaman is drawn by some occult power toward the topof the staff, which is commonly covered with hieroglyphics. With his palmpressing upon it, he is then raised to a considerable height in the air, wherehe remains for some time. Sometimes he leaps to an extraordinary height, and,according to the control--for he is often but an irresponsible medium--pours outprophecies and describes future events. Thus, it was that, in 1847, a Shaman ina distant part of Siberia prophesied and accurately detailed the issue of theCrimean war. The particulars of the prognostication being carefully noted bythose present at the time, were all verified six years after this occurrence.Although usually ignorant of even the name of astronomy, let alone havingstudied this science, they often prophesy eclipses and other astronomicalphenomena. When consulted about thefts and murders, they invariably point outthe guilty parties. The Shamans of Siberia are all ignorant and illiterate. Those of Tartary andThibet--few in number--are mostly learned men in their own way, and will notallow themselves to fall under the control of spirits of any kind. The formerare mediums in the full sense of the word; the latter, \"magicians.\" It is notsurprising that pious and superstitious persons, after seeing one of suchcrises, should declare the Shaman to be under demoniacal possession. As in theinstances of Corybantic and Bacchantic fury among the ancient Greeks, the\"spiritual\" crisis of the Shaman exhibits itself in violent dancing and wildgestures. Little by little the lookers-on feel the spirit of imitation arousedin them; seized with an irresistible impulse, they dance, and become, in theirturn, ecstatics; and he who begins by joining the chorus, gradually andunconsciously takes part in the gesticulations, until he sinks to the groundexhausted, and often dying. \"O, young girl, a god possesses thee! it is either Pan, or Hekate, or, thevenerable Corybantes, or Cybele that agitates thee!\" the chorus says, addressingPhaedra, in Euripides. This form of psychological epidemic has been too wellknown from the time of the middle ages to cite instances from it. The Choroeasancti Viti is an historical fact, and spread throughout Germany. Paracelsuscured quite a number of persons possessed of such a spirit of imitation. But hewas a kabalist, and therefore accused, by his enemies, of having cast out thedevils by the power of a stronger demon, which he was believed to carry aboutwith him in the hilt of his sword. The Christian judges of those days of horrorfound a better and a surer remedy. Voltaire states that, in the district ofJura, between 1598 and 1600, over 600 Lycanthropes were put to death by a piousjudge. But, while the illiterate Shaman is a victim, and during his crisis sometimessees the persons present, under the shape of various animals, and often makesthem share his hallucination, his brother Shaman, learned in the mysteries ofthe priestly colleges of Thibet, expels the elementary creature, which canproduce the hallucination as well as a living mesmerizer, not through the helpof a stronger demon, but simply through his knowledge of the nature of theinvisible enemy. Where academicians have failed, as in the cases of theCevennois, a Shaman or a lama would have soon put an end to the epidemic. We have mentioned a kind of carnelian stone in our possession, which had such anunexpected and favorable effect upon the Shaman's decision. Every Shaman hassuch a talisman, which he wears attached to a string, and carries under his leftarm. \"Of what use is it to you, and what are its virtues?\" was the question we oftenoffered to our guide. To this he never answered directly, but evaded allexplanation, promising that as soon as an opportunity was offered, and we werealone, he would ask the stone to answer for himself. With this very indefinitehope, we were left to the resources of our own imagination. But the day on which the stone \"spoke\" came very soon. It was during the mostcritical hours of our life; at a time when the vagabond nature of a travellerhad carried the writer to far-off lands, where neither civilization is known,nor security can be guaranteed for one hour. One afternoon, as every man andwoman had left the yourta (Tartar tent), that had been our home for over twomonths, to witness the ceremony of the Lamaic exorcism of a Tshoutgour, *[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/iu/iu111.htm#fn_1162] accused of breaking andspiriting away every bit of the poor furniture and earthenware of a familyliving about two miles distant, the Shaman, who had become our only protector inthose dreary deserts, was reminded of his promise. He sighed and hesitated; but,after a short silence, left his place on the sheepskin, and, going outside,placed a dried-up goat's head with its prominent horns over a wooden peg, andthen dropping down the felt curtain of the tent, remarked that now no livingperson would venture in, for the goat's head was a sign that he was \"at work.\" After that, placing his hand in his bosom, he drew out the little stone, aboutthe size of a walnut, and, carefully unwrapping it, proceeded, as it appeared,to swallow it. In a few moments his limbs stiffened, his body became rigid, andhe fell, cold and motionless as a corpse. But for a slight twitching of his lipsat every question asked, the scene would have been embarrassing, nay--dreadful.The sun was setting, and were it not that dying embers flickered at the centreof the tent, complete darkness would have been added to the oppressive silencewhich reigned. We have lived in the prairies of the West, and in the boundlesssteppes of Southern Russia; but nothing can be compared with the silence atsunset on the sandy deserts of Mongolia; not even the barren solitudes of thedeserts of Africa, though the former are partially inhabited, and the latterutterly void of life. Yet, there was the writer alone with what looked no betterthan a corpse lying on the ground. Fortunately, this state did not last long. \"Mahandu!\" uttered a voice, which seemed to come from the bowels of the earth,on which the Shaman was prostrated. \"Peace be with you . . . what would you haveme do for you?\" Startling as the fact seemed, we were quite prepared for it, for we had seenother Shamans pass through similar performances. \"Whoever you are,\" wepronounced mentally, \"go to K----, and try to bring that person's thought here.See what that other party does, and tell ****** what we are doing and howsituated.\" \"I am there\"; answered the same voice. \"The old lady (kokona) *is sitting in thegarden . . . she is putting on her spectacles and reading a letter.\" \"The contents of it, and hasten,\" was the hurried order while preparingnote-book and pencil. The contents were given slowly, as if, while dictating,the invisible presence desired to afford us time to put down the wordsphonetically, for we recognized the Valachian language of which we know nothingbeyond the ability to recognize it. In such a way a whole page was filled. \"Look west . . . toward the third pole of the yourta,\" pronounced the Tartar inhis natural voice, though it sounded hollow, and as if coming from afar. \"Herthought is here.\" Then with a convulsive jerk, the upper portion of the Shaman's body seemedraised, and his head fell heavily on the writer's feet, which he clutched withboth his hands. The position was becoming less and less attractive, butcuriosity proved a good ally to courage. In the west corner was standing,life-like but flickering, unsteady and mist-like, the form of a dear old friend,a Roumanian lady of Valachia, a mystic by disposition, but a thoroughdisbeliever in this kind of occult phenomena. \"Her thought is here, but her body is lying unconscious. We could not bring herhere otherwise,\" said the voice. We addressed and supplicated the apparition to answer, but all in vain. Thefeatures moved, and the form gesticulated as if in fear and agony, but no soundbroke forth from the shadowy lips; only we imagined--perchance it was afancy--hearing as if from a long distance the Roumanian words, \"Non se pote\" (itcannot be done). For over two hours, the most substantial, unequivocal proofs that the Shaman'sastral soul was travelling at the bidding of our unspoken wish, were given us.Ten months later, we received a letter from our Valachian friend in response toours, in which we had enclosed the page from the note-book, inquiring of herwhat she had been doing on that day, and describing the scene in full. She wassitting--she wrote--in the garden on that morning * prosaically occupied inboiling some conserves; the letter sent to her was word for word the copy of theone received by her from her brother; all at once--in consequence of the heat,she thought--she fainted, and remembered distinctly dreaming she saw the writerin a desert place which she accurately described, and sitting under a \"gypsy'stent,\" as she expressed it. \"Henceforth,\" she added, \"I can doubt no longer!\" But our experiment was proved still better. We had directed the Shaman's innerego to the same friend heretofore mentioned in this chapter, the Kutchi ofLha-Ssa, who travels constantly to British India and back. We know that he wasapprised of our critical situation in the desert; for a few hours later camehelp, and we were rescued by a party of twenty-five horsemen who had beendirected by their chief to find us at the place where we were, which no livingman endowed with common powers could have known. The chief of this escort was aShaberon, an \"adept\" whom we had never seen before, nor did we after that, forhe never left his soumay (lamasery), and we could have no access to it. But hewas a personal friend of the Kutchi. The above will of course provoke naught but incredulity in the general reader.But we write for those who will believe; who, like the writer, understand andknow the illimitable powers and possibilities of the human astral soul. In thiscase we willingly believe, nay, we know, that the \"spiritual double\" of theShaman did not act alone, for he was no adept, but simply a medium. According toa favorite expression of his, as soon as he placed the stone in his mouth, his\"father appeared, dragged him out of his skin, and took him wherever he wanted,\"and at his bidding. one who has only witnessed the chemical, optical, mechanical, andsleight-of-hand performances of European prestidigitateurs, is not prepared tosee, without amazement, the open-air and off-hand exhibitions of Hindu jugglers,to say nothing of fakirs. Of the mere displays of deceptive dexterity we make noaccount, for Houdin and others far excel them in that respect; or do we dwellupon feats that permit of confederacy, whether resorted to or not. It isunquestionably true that non-expert travellers, especially if of an imaginativeturn of mind, exaggerate inordinately. But our remark is based upon a class ofphenomena not to be accounted for upon any of the familiar hypotheses. \"I haveseen,\" says a gentleman who resided in India, \"a man throw up into the air anumber of balls numbered in succession from one upwards. As each went up--andthere was no deception about their going up--the ball was seen clearly in theair, getting smaller and smaller, till it disappeared altogether out of sight.When they were all up, twenty or more, the operator would politely ask whichball you wanted to see, and then would shout out, 'No. 1,' 'No. 15,' and so on,as instructed by the spectators, when the ball demanded would bound to his feetviolently from some remote distance. . . . These fellows have very scantyclothing, and apparently no apparatus whatever. Then, I have seen them swallowthree different colored powders, and then, throwing back the head, wash themdown with water, drunk, in the native fashion, in a continuous stream from alotah, or brass-pot, held at arm's length from the lips, and keep on drinkingtill the swollen body could not hold another drop, and water overflowed from thelips. Then, these fellows, after squirting out the water in their mouths, havespat out the three powders on a clean piece of paper, dry and unmixed.\" * In the eastern portion of Turkey and Persia, have dwelt, from time immemorial,the warlike tribes of the Koordistan. This people of purely Indo-Europeanorigin, and without a drop of Semitic blood in them (though some ethnologistsseem to think otherwise), notwithstanding their brigand-like disposition, unitein themselves the mysticism of the Hindu and the practices of theAssyrio-Chaldean magians, vast portions of whose territory they have helpedthemselves to, and will not give up, to please either Turkey or even allEurope. ** Nominally, Mahometans of the sect of Omar, their rites and doctrinesare purely magical and magian. Even those who are Christian Nestorians, areChristians but in name. The Kaldany, numbering nearly 100,000 men, and withtheir two Patriarchs, are undeniably rather Manicheans than Nestorians. Many ofthem are Yezids. One of these tribes is noted for its fire-worshipping predilections. At sunriseand sunset, the horsemen alight and, turning towards the sun, mutter a prayer;while at every new moon they perform mysterious rites throughout the wholenight. They have a tent set apart for the purpose, and its thick, black, woolenfabric is decorated with weird signs, worked in bright red and yellow. In thecentre is placed a kind of altar, encircled by three brass bands, to which aresuspended numerous rings by ropes of camel's hair, which every worshipper holdswith his right hand during the ceremony. On the altar burns a curious,old-fashioned silver lamp, a relic found possibly among the ruins ofPersepolis. * This lamp, with three wicks, is an oblong cup with a handle to it,and is evidently of the class of Egyptian sepulchral lamps, once found in suchprofusion in the subterranean caves of Memphis, if we may believe Kircher. ** Itwidened from its end toward the middle, and its upper part was of the shape of aheart; the apertures for the wicks forming a triangle, and its centre beingcovered by an inverted heliotrope attached to a gracefully-curved stalkproceeding from the handle of the lamp. This ornament clearly bespoke itsorigin. It was one of the sacred vessels used in sun-worship. The Greeks gavethe heliotrope its name from its strange propensity to ever incline towards thesun. The ancient Magi used it in their worship; and who knows but Darius hadperformed the mysterious rites with its triple light illuminating the face ofthe king-hierophant! If we mention the lamp at all, it is because there happened to be a strangestory in connection with it. What the Koords do, during their nocturnal rites oflunar-worship, we know but from hearsay; for they conceal it carefully, and nostranger could be admitted to witness the ceremony. But every tribe has one oldman, sometimes several, regarded as \"holy beings,\" who know the past, and candivulge the secrets of the future. These are greatly honored, and generallyresorted to for information in cases of theft, murders, or danger. Travelling from one tribe to the other, we passed some time in company withthese Koords. As our object is not autobiographical, we omit all details thathave no immediate bearing upon some occult fact, and even of these, have roombut for a few. We will then simply state that a very expensive saddle, a carpet,and two Circassian daggers, richly mounted and chiselled in gold, had beenstolen from the tent, and that the Koords, with the chief of the tribe at thehead, had come, taking Allah for their witness that the culprit could not belongto their tribe. We believed it, for it would have been unprecedented among thesenomadic tribes of Asia, as famed for the sacredness in which they hold theirguests, as for the ease with which they plunder and occasionally murder them,when once they have passed the boundaries of their aoul. A suggestion was then made by a Georgian belonging to our caravan to have resortto the light of the koodian (sorcerer) of their tribe. This was arranged ingreat secrecy and solemnity, and the interview appointed to take place atmidnight, when the moon would be at its full. At the stated hour we wereconducted to the above-described tent. A large hole, or square aperture, was managed in the arched roof of the tent,and through it poured in vertically the radiant moonbeams, mingling with thevacillating triple flame of the little lamp. After several minutes ofincantations, addressed, as it seemed to us, to the moon, the conjurer, an oldman of tremendous stature, whose pyramidal turban touched the top of the tent,produced a round looking-glass, of the kind known as \"Persian mirrors.\" Havingunscrewed its cover, he then proceeded to breathe on it, for over ten minutes,and wipe off the moisture from the surface with a package of herbs, mutteringincantations the while sotto voce. After every wiping the glass became more andmore brilliant, till its crystal seemed to radiate refulgent phosphoric rays inevery direction. At last the operation was ended; the old man, with the mirrorin his hand, remained as motionless as if he had been a statue. \"Look, Hanoum .. . look steadily,\" he whispered, hardly moving his lips. Shadows and dark spotsbegan gathering, where one moment before nothing was reflected but the radiantface of the full moon. A few more seconds, and there appeared the well-knownsaddle, carpet, and daggers, which seemed to be rising as from a deep, clearwater, and becoming with every instant more definitely outlined. Then a stilldarker shadow appeared hovering over these objects, which gradually condenseditself, and then came out, as visibly as at the small end of a telescope, thefull figure of a man crouching over them. \"I know him!\" exclaimed the writer. \"It is the Tartar who came to us last night,offering to sell his mule!\" The image disappeared, as if by enchantment. The old man nodded assent, butremained motionless. Then he muttered again some strange words, and suddenlybegan a song. The tune was slow and monotonous, but after he had sung a fewstanzas in the same unknown tongue, without changing either rhythm or tune, hepronounced, recitative-like, the following words, in his broken Russian: \"Now, Hanoum, look well, whether we will catch him--the fate of the robber--wewill learn this night,\" etc. The same shadows began gathering, and then, almost without transition, we sawthe man lying on his back, in a pool of blood, across the saddle, and two othermen galloping off at a distance. Horror-stricken, and sick at the sight of thispicture, we desired to see no more. The old man, leaving the tent, called someof the Koords standing outside, and seemed to give them instructions. Twominutes later, a dozen of horsemen were galloping off at full speed down theside of the mountain on which we were encamped. Early in the morning they returned with the lost objects. The saddle was allcovered with coagulated blood, and of course abandoned to them. The story theytold was, that upon coming in sight of the fugitive, they saw disappearing overthe crest of a distant hill two horsemen, and upon riding up, the Tartar thiefwas found dead upon the stolen property, exactly as we had seen him in themagical glass. He had been murdered by the two banditti, whose evident design torob him was interrupted by the sudden appearance of the party sent by the oldKoodian. The most remarkable results are produced by the Eastern \"wise men,\" by thesimple act of breathing upon a person, whether with good or evil intent. This ispure mesmerism; and among the Persian dervishes who practice it the animalmagnetism is often reinforced by that of the elements. If a person happens tostand facing a certain wind, there is always danger, they think; and many of the\"learned ones\" in occult matters can never be prevailed upon to go at sunset ina certain direction from whence blows the wind. We have known an old Persianfrom Baku, * on the Caspian Sea, who had the most unenviable reputation forthrowing spells through the timely help of this wind, which blows but too oftenat that town, as its Persian name itself shows. ** If a victim, against whom thewrath of the old fiend was kindled, happened to be facing this wind, he wouldappear, as if by enchantment, cross the road rapidly, and breathe in his face.From that moment, the latter would find himself afflicted with every evil--hewas under the spell of the \"evil eye.\" The employment of the human breath by the sorcerer as an adjunct for theaccomplishment of his nefarious purpose, is strikingly illustrated in severalterrible cases recorded in the French annals--notably those of several Catholicpriests. In fact, this species of sorcery was known from the oldest times. TheEmperor Constantine (in Statute iv., Code de Malef., etc.) prescribed theseverest penalties against such as should employ sorcery to do violence tochastity and excite unlawful passion. Augustine (Cite de Dieu) warns against it;Jerome, Gregory, Nazianzen, and many other ecclesiastical authorities, lendtheir denunciation of a crime not uncommon among the clergy. Baffet (book v.,tit. 19, chap. 6) relates the case of the cure of Peifane, who accomplished theruin of a highly-respected and virtuous lady parishioner, the Dame du Lieu, byresort to sorcery, and was burned alive for it by the Parliament of Grenoble. In1611, a priest named Gaufridy was burned by the Parliament of Provence forseducing a penitent at the confessional, named Magdelaine de la Palud, bybreathing upon her, and thus throwing her into a delirium of sinful love forhim. The above cases are cited in the official report of the famous case of FatherGirard, a Jesuit priest of very great influence, who, in 1731, was tried beforethe Parliament of Aix, France, for the seduction of his parishioner, Mlle.Catherine Cadiere, of Toulon, and certain revolting crimes in connection withthe same. The indictment charged that the offence was brought about by resort tosorcery. Mlle. Cadiere was a young lady noted for her beauty, piety, andexemplary virtues. Her attention to her religious duties was exceptionallyrigorous, and that was the cause of her perdition. Father Girard's eye fell uponher, and he began to manoeuvre for her ruin. Gaining the confidence of the girland her family by his apparent great sanctity, he one day made a pretext to blowhis breath upon her. The girl became instantly affected with a violent passionfor him. She also had ecstatic visions of a religious character, stigmata, orblood-marks of the \"Passion,\" and hysterical convulsions. The long-soughtopportunity of seclusion with his penitent finally offering, the Jesuit breathedupon her again, and before the poor girl recovered her senses, his object hadbeen accomplished. By sophistry and the excitation of her religious fervor, hekept up this illicit relation for months, without her suspecting that she haddone anything wrong. Finally, however, her eyes were opened, her parentsinformed, and the priest was arraigned. Judgment was rendered October 12th,1731. Of twenty-five judges, twelve voted to send him to the stake. The criminalpriest was defended by all the power of the Society of Jesus, and it is saidthat a million francs were spent in trying to suppress the evidence produced atthe trial. The facts, however, were printed in a work (in 5 vols., 16mo), nowrare, entitled Recueil General des Pieces contenues au Procez du PereJean-Baptiste Girard, Jeuite, etc., etc. * We have noted the circumstance that, while under the sorcerous influence ofFather Girard, and in illicit relations with him, Mlle. Cadiere's body wasmarked with the stigmata of the Passion, viz.: the bleeding wounds of thorns onher brow, of nails in her hands and feet, and of a lance-cut in her side. Itshould be added that the same marks were seen upon the bodies of six otherpenitents of this priest, viz.: Mesdames Guyol, Laugier, Grodier, Allemande,Batarelle, and Reboul. In fact, it became commonly remarked that Father Girard'shandsome parishioners were strangely given to ecstasies and stigmata! Add thisto the fact that, in the case of Father Gaufridy, above noted, the same thingwas proved, upon surgical testimony, to have happened to Mlle. de Palud, and wehave something worth the attention of all (especially spiritualists) who imaginethese stigmata are produced by pure spirits. Barring the agency of the Devil,whom we have quietly put to rest in another chapter, Catholics would be puzzled,we fancy, despite all their infallibility, to distinguish between the stigmataof the sorcerers and those produced through the intervention of the Holy Ghostor the angels. The Church records abound in instances of alleged diabolicalimitations of these signs of saintship, but, as we have remarked, the Devil isout of court. By those who have followed us thus far, it will naturally be asked, to whatpractical issue this book tends; much has been said about magic and itspotentiality, much of the immense antiquity of its practice. Do we wish toaffirm that the occult sciences ought to be studied and practiced throughout theworld? Would we replace modern spiritualism with the ancient magic? Neither; thesubstitution could not be made, nor the study universally prosecuted, withoutincurring the risk of enormous public dangers. At this moment, a well-knownspiritualist and lecturer on mesmerism is imprisoned on the charge of raping asubject whom he had hypnotized. A sorcerer is a public enemy, and mesmerism maymost readily be turned into the worst of sorceries. We would have neither scientists, theologians, nor spiritualists turn practicalmagicians, but all to realize that there was true science, profound religion,and genuine phenomena before this modern era. We would that all who have a voicein the education of the masses should first know and then teach that the safestguides to human happiness and enlightenment are those writings which havedescended to us from the remotest antiquity; and that nobler spiritualaspirations and a higher average morality prevail in the countries where thepeople take their precepts as the rule of their lives. We would have all torealize that magical, i.e., spiritual powers exist in every man, and those fewto practice them who feel called to teach, and are ready to pay the price ofdiscipline and self-conquest which their development exacts. Many men have arisen who had glimpses of the truth, and fancied they had it all.Such have failed to achieve the good they might have done and sought to do,because vanity has made them thrust their personality into such undue prominenceas to interpose it between their believers and the whole truth that lay behind.The world needs no sectarian church, whether of Buddha, Jesus, Mahomet,Swedenborg, Calvin, or any other. There being but ONE Truth, man requires butone church--the Temple of God within us, walled in by matter but penetrable byany one who can find the way; the pure in heart see God. The trinity of nature is the lock of magic, the trinity of man the key that fitsit. Within the solemn precincts of the sanctuary the SUPREME had and has noname. It is unthinkable and unpronounceable; and yet every man finds in himselfhis god. \"Who art thou, O fair being?\" inquires the disembodied soul, in theKhordah-Avesta, at the gates of Paradise. \"I am, O Soul, thy good and purethoughts, thy works and thy good law . . . thy angel . . . and thy god.\" Thenman, or the soul, is reunited with ITSELF, for this \"Son of God\" is one withhim; it is his own mediator, the god of his human soul and his \"Justifier.\" \"Godnot revealing himself immediately to man, the spirit is his interpreter,\" saysPlato in the Banquet. Besides, there are many good reasons why the study of magic, except in its broadphilosophy, is nearly impracticable in Europe and America. Magic being what itis, the most difficult of all sciences to learn experimentally--its acquisitionis practically beyond the reach of the majority of white-skinned people; andthat, whether their effort is made at home or in the East. Probably not morethan one man in a million of European blood is fitted--either physically,morally, or psychologically--to become a practical magician, and not one in tenmillions would be found endowed with all these three qualifications as requiredfor the work. Civilized nations lack the phenomenal powers of endurance, bothmental and physical, of the Easterns; the favoring temperamental idiosyncrasiesof the Orientals are utterly wanting in them. In the Hindu, the Arabian, theThibetan, an intuitive perception of the possibilities of occult natural forcesin subjection to human will, comes by inheritance; and in them, the physicalsenses as well as the spiritual are far more finely developed than in theWestern races. Notwithstanding the notable difference of thickness between theskulls of a European and a Southern Hindu, this difference, being a purelyclimatic result, due to the intensity of the sun's rays, involves nopsychological principles. Furthermore, there would be tremendous difficulties inthe way of training, if we can so express it. Contaminated by centuries ofdogmatic superstition, by an ineradicable--though quite unwarranted--sense ofsuperiority over those whom the English term so contemptuously \"niggers,\" thewhite European would hardly submit himself to the practical tuition of eitherKopt, Brahman, or Lama. To become a neophyte, one must be ready to devotehimself heart and soul to the study of mystic sciences. Magic--most imperativeof mistresses--brooks no rival. Unlike other sciences, a theoretical knowledgeof formulai without mental capacities or soul powers, is utterly useless inmagic. The spirit must hold in complete subjection the combativeness of what isloosely termed educated reason, until facts have vanquished cold humansophistry. Those best prepared to appreciate occultism are the spiritualists, although,through prejudice, until now they have been the bitterest opponents to itsintroduction to public notice. Despite all foolish negations and denunciations,their phenomena are real. Despite, also, their own assertions they are whollymisunderstood by themselves. The totally insufficient theory of the constantagency of disembodied human spirits in their production has been the bane of theCause. A thousand mortifying rebuffs have failed to open their reason orintuition to the truth. Ignoring the teachings of the past, they have discoveredno substitute. We offer them philosophical deduction instead of unverifiablehypothesis, scientific analysis and demonstration instead of undiscriminatingfaith. Occult philosophy gives them the means of meeting the reasonablerequirements of science, and frees them from the humiliating necessity to acceptthe oracular teachings of \"intelligences,\" which as a rule have lessintelligence than a child at school. So based and so strengthened, modernphenomena would be in a position to command the attention and enforce therespect of those who carry with them public opinion. Without invoking such help,spiritualism must continue to vegetate, equally repulsed--not withoutcause--both by scientists and theologians. In its modern aspect, it is neither ascience, a religion, nor a philosophy. Are we unjust; does any intelligent spiritualist complain that we have misstatedthe case? To what can he point us but to a confusion of theories, a tangle ofhypotheses mutually contradictory? Can he affirm that spiritualism, even withits thirty years of phenomena, has any defensible philosophy; nay, that there isanything like an established method that is generally accepted and followed byits recognized representatives? And yet, there are many thoughtful, scholarly, earnest writers among thespiritualists, scattered the world over. There are men who, in addition to ascientific mental training and a reasoned faith in the phenomena per se, possessall the requisites of leaders of the movement. How is it then, that, exceptthrowing off an isolated volume or so, or occasional contributions tojournalism, they all refrain from taking any active part in the formation of asystem of philosophy? This is from no lack of moral courage, as their writingswell show. Nor because of indifference, for enthusiasm abounds, and they aresure of their facts. Nor is it from lack of capacity, because many are men ofmark, the peers of our best minds. It is simply for the reason that, almostwithout exception, they are bewildered by the contradictions they encounter, andwait for their tentative hypotheses to be verified by further experience.Doubtless this is the part of wisdom. It is that adopted by Newton, who, withthe heroism of an honest, unselfish heart, withheld for seventeen years thepromulgation of his theory of gravitation, only because he had not verified itto his own satisfaction. Spiritualism, whose aspect is rather that of aggression than of defense, hastended toward iconoclasm, and so far has done well. But, in pulling down, itdoes not rebuild. Every really substantial truth it erects is soon buried underan avalanche of chimeras, until all are in one confused ruin. At every step ofadvance, at the acquisition of every new vantage-ground of FACT, some cataclysm,either in the shape of fraud and exposure, or of premeditated treachery, occurs,and throws the spiritualists back powerless because they cannot and theirinvisible friends will not (or perchance can, less than themselves) make goodtheir claims. Their fatal weakness is that they have but one theory to offer inexplanation of their challenged facts--the agency of human disembodied spirits,and the medium's complete subjection to them. They will attack those who differin views with them with a vehemence only warranted by a better cause; they willregard every argument contradicting their theory as an imputation upon theircommon sense and powers of observation; and they will positively refuse even toargue the question. How, then, can spiritualism be ever elevated to the distinction of a science?This, as Professor Tyndall shows, includes three absolutely necessary elements:observation of facts; induction of laws from these facts; and verification ofthose laws by constant practical experience. What experienced observer willmaintain that spiritualism presents either one of these three elements? Themedium is not uniformly surrounded by such test conditions that we may be sureof the facts; the inductions from the supposed facts are unwarranted in theabsence of such verification; and, as a corollary, there has been no sufficientverification of those hypotheses by experience. In short, the prime element ofaccuracy has, as a rule, been lacking. That we may not be charged with desire to misrepresent the position ofspiritualism, at the date of this present writing, or accused of withholdingcredit for advances actually made, we will cite a few passages from the LondonSpiritualist of March 2, 1877. At the fortnightly meeting, held February 19, adebate occurred upon the subject of \"Ancient Thought and Modern Spiritualism.\"Some of the most intelligent Spiritualists of England participated. Among thesewas Mr. W. Stainton Moses, M. A., who has recently given some attention to therelation between ancient and modern phenomena. He said: \"Popular spiritualism isnot scientific; it does very little in the way of scientific verification.Moreover, exoteric spiritualism is, to a large extent, devoted to presumedcommunion with personal friends, or to the gratification of curiosity, or themere evolution of marvels. . . . The truly esoteric science of spiritualism isvery rare, and not more rare than valuable. To it we must look to theorigination of knowledge which may be developed exoterically. . . . We proceedtoo much on the lines of the physicists; our tests are crude, and oftenillusory; we know too little of the Protean power of spirit. Here the ancientswere far ahead of us, and can teach us much. We have not introduced anycertainty into the conditions--a necessary prerequisite for true scientificexperiment. This is largely owing to the fact that our circles are constructedon no principle. . . . We have not even mastered the elementary truths which theancients knew and acted on, e.g., the isolation of mediums. We have been sooccupied with wonder-hunting that we have hardly tabulated the phenomena, orpropounded one theory to account for the production of the simplest of them. . .. We have never faced the question: What is the intelligence? This is the greatblot, the most frequent source of error, and here we might learn with advantagefrom the ancients. There is the strongest disinclination among spiritualists toadmit the possibility of the truth of occultism. In this respect they are ashard to convince as is the outer world of spiritualism. Spiritualists start witha fallacy, viz.: that all phenomena are caused by the action of departed humanspirits; they have not looked into the powers of the human spirit; they do notknow the extent to which spirit acts, how far it reaches, what it underlies.\" Our position could not be better defined. If Spiritualism has a future, it is inthe keeping of such men as Mr. Stainton Moses. Our work is done--would that it were better done! But, despite our inexperiencein the art of book-making, and the serious difficulty of writing in a foreigntongue, we hope we have succeeded in saying some things that will remain in theminds of the thoughtful. The enemies of truth have been all counted, and allpassed in review. Modern science, powerless to satisfy the aspirations of therace, makes the future a void, and bereaves man of hope. In one sense, it islike the Baital Pachisi, the Hindu vampire of popular fancy, which lives in deadbodies, and feeds but on the rottenness of matter. The theology of Christendomhas been rubbed threadbare by the most serious minds of the day. It is found tobe, on the whole, subversive, rather than promotive of spirituality and goodmorals. Instead of expounding the rules of divine law and justice, it teachesbut itself. In place of an ever-living Deity, it preaches the Evil One, andmakes him indistinguishable from God Himself! \"Lead us not into temptation\" isthe aspiration of Christians. Who, then, is the tempter? Satan? No; the prayeris not addressed to him. It is that tutelar genius who hardened the heart ofPharaoh, put an evil spirit into Saul, sent lying messengers to the prophets,and tempted David to sin; it is--the Bible-God of Israel! Our examination of the multitudinous religious faiths that mankind, early andlate, have professed, most assuredly indicates that they have all been derivedfrom one primitive source. It would seem as if they were all but different modesof expressing the yearning of the imprisoned human soul for intercourse withsupernal spheres. As the white ray of light is decomposed by the prism into thevarious colors of the solar spectrum, so the beam of divine truth, in passingthrough the three-sided prism of man's nature, has been broken up intovari-colored fragments called RELIGIONS. And, as the rays of the spectrum, byimperceptible shadings, merge into each other, so the great theologies that haveappeared at different degrees of divergence from the original source, have beenconnected by minor schisms, schools, and off-shoots from the one side or theother. Combined, their aggregate represents one eternal truth; separate, theyare but shades of human error and the signs of imperfection. The worship of theVedic pitris is fast becoming the worship of the spiritual portion of mankind.It but needs the right perception of things objective to finally discover thatthe only world of reality is the subjective. What has been contemptuously termed Paganism, was ancient wisdom replete withDeity; and Judaism and its offspring, Christianity and Islamism, derivedwhatever of inspiration they contained from this ethnic parent. Pre-VedicBrahmanism and Buddhism are the double source from which all religions sprung;Nirvana is the ocean to which all tend. For the purposes of a philosophical analysis, we need not take account of theenormities which have blackened the record of many of the world's religions.True faith is the embodiment of divine charity; those who minister at itsaltars, are but human. As we turn the blood-stained pages of ecclesiasticalhistory, we find that, whoever may have been the hero, and whatever costumes theactors may have worn, the plot of the tragedy has ever been the same. But theEternal Night was in and behind all, and we pass from what we see to that whichis invisible to the eye of sense. Our fervent wish has been to show true soulshow they may lift aside the curtain, and, in the brightness of that Night madeDay, look with undazzled gaze upon the UNVEILED TRUTH. THE END.

They are forbidden, 1, to ask orbeg for anything--even were they starving--having to wait until it isvoluntarily offered; 2, to touch either gold or silver with their hands; 3, toeat a morsel of food, even when presented, unless the donor distinctly says tothe disciple, \"This is for your master to eat.\" Thereupon, the disciple turningto the pazen has to offer the food in his turn, and when he has said, \"Master,this is allowed; take and eat,\" then only can the lama take it with the righthand, and partake of it. All our offerings had to pass through suchpurifications. When the silver pieces, and a few handfuls of annas (a coin equalto four cents) were at different occasions offered to the community, a disciplefirst wrapped his hand in a yellow handkerchief, and receiving it on his palm,conveyed the sum immediately into the Badir, called elsewhere Sabait, a sacredbasin, generally wooden, kept for offerings. 600:** These stones are highly venerated among Lamaists and Buddhists; thethrone and sceptre of Buddha are ornamented with them, and the Taley Lama wearsone on the fourth finger of the right hand. They are found in the AltaiMountains, and near the river Yarkuh. Our talisman was a gift from the venerablehigh-priest, a Heiloung, of a Kalmuck tribe. Though treated as apostates fromtheir primitive Lamaism, these nomads maintain friendly intercourse with theirbrother Kalmucks, the Chokhots of Eastern Thibet and Kokonor, but even with theLamaists of Lha-Ssa. The ecclesiastical authorities however, will have norelations with them. We have had abundant opportunities to become acquaintedwith this interesting people of the Astrakhan Steppes, having lived in theirKibitkas in our early years, and partaken of the lavish hospitality of thePrince Tumene, their late chief, and his Princess. In their religiousceremonies, the Kalmucks employ trumpets made from the thigh and arm bones ofdeceased rulers and high priests. 603:*The Buddhist Kalmucks of the Astrakhan steppes are accustomed to make theiridols out of the cremated ashes of their princes and priests. A relative of theauthor has in her collection several small pyramids composed of the ashes ofeminent Kalmucks and presented to her by the Prince Tumene himself in 1836. 603:**The sacred fan used by the chief priests instead of an umbrella. 603:*** See vol. i., p. 476. 606:* See his \"Lectures on Sound.\" 607:*From the compound word sutra, maxim or precept, and antika, close or near. 608:* It sounds like injustice to Asoka to compare him with Constantine, as isdone by several Orientalists. If, in the religious and political sense, Asokadid for India what Constantine is alleged to have achieved for the WesternWorld, all similarity stops there. 614:* See \"Indian Sketches\"; Appleton's \"New Cyclopedia,\" etc. 616:*Aum (mystic Sanscrit term of the Trinity), mani (holy jewel), padme (in thelotus, padma being the name for lotus), houm (be it so). The six syllables inthe sentence correspond to the six chief powers of nature emanating from Buddha(the abstract deity, not Gautama), who is the seventh, and the Alpha and Omegaof being. 616:**Moru (the pure) is one of the most famous lamaseries of Lha-Ssa, directlyin the centre of the city. There the Shaberon, the Taley Lama, resides thegreater portion of the winter months; during two or three months of the warmseason his abode is at Foht-lla. At Moru is the largest typographicalestablishment of the country. 617:*The Buddhist great canon, containing 1,083 works in several hundredvolumes, many of which treat of magic. 618:*\"Crawfurd's Mission to Siam,\" p. 182. 619:* \"Semedo,\" vol. iii., p. 114. 619:** There was an anecdote current among Daguerre's friends between 1838 and1840. At an evening party, Madame Daguerre, some two months previous to theintroduction of the celebrated Daguerrean process to the Academie des Sciences,by Arago (January, 1839), had an earnest consultation with one of the medicalcelebrities of the day about her husband's mental condition. After explaining tothe physician the numerous symptoms of what she believed to be her husband'smental aberration, she added, with tears in her eyes, that the greatest proof toher of Daguerre's insanity was his firm conviction that he would succeed innailing his own shadow to the wall, or fixing it on magical metallic plates. Thephysician listened to the intelligence very attentively, and answered that hehad himself observed in Daguerre lately the strongest symptoms of what, to hismind, was an undeniable proof of madness. He closed the conversation by firmlyadvising her to send her husband quietly and without delay to Bicetre, thewell-known lunatic asylum. Two months later a profound interest was created inthe world of art and science by the exhibition of a number of pictures taken bythe new process. The shadows were fixed, after all, upon metallic plates, andthe \"lunatic\" proclaimed the father of photography. 620:* Schott: \"Uber den Buddhismus,\" p. 71. 620:** \"The Book of Ser Marco Polo,\" vol. ii., p. 352. 620:*** Ibid., vol. ii., p. 130, quoted by Col. Yule in vol. ii., p. 353. 621:* No country in the world can boast of more medicinal plants than SouthernIndia, Cochin, Burmah, Siam, and Ceylon. European physicians--according totime-honored practice--settle the case of professional rivalship, by treatingthe native doctors as quacks and empirics; but this does not prevent the latterfrom being often successful in cases in which eminent graduates of British andFrench schools of Medicine have signally failed. Native works on Materia Medicado not certainly contain the secret remedies known, and successfully applied bythe native doctors (the Atibba), from time immemorial; and yet the bestfebrifuges have been learned by British physicians from the p. 622 Hindus, andwhere patients, deafened and swollen by abuse of quinine, were slowly dying offever under the treatment of enlightened physicians, the bark of the Margosa,and the Chiretta herb have cured them completely, and these now occupy anhonorable place among European drugs. 622:* The Hindu appellation for the peculiar mantram or charm which prevents theserpent from biting. 624:* Between the bells of the \"heathen\" worshippers, and the bells andpomegranates of the Jewish worship, the difference is this: the former, besidespurifying the soul of man with their harmonious tones, kept evil demons at adistance, \"for the sound of pure bronze breaks the enchantment,\" says Tibullius(i., 8-22), and the latter explained it by saying that the sound of the bells\"should be heard [by the Lord] when he [the priest] goeth in unto the holy placebefore the Lord, and when he goeth out, that he die not\" (Exodus xxviii. 33;Eccles. xiv. 9). Thus, one sound served to keep away evil spirits, and theother, the Spirit of Jehovah.

It belongs to Russian Georgia. About twelve miles northeastfrom Baku stands the remnant of an ancient Guebre temple, consisting of fourcolumns, from whose empty orifices issue constantly jets of flame, which givesit, therefore, the name of Temple of the Perpetual Fire. The whole region iscovered with lakes and springs of naphtha. Pilgrims assemble there from distantparts of Asia, and a priesthood, worshipping the divine principle of fire, iskept by some tribes, scattered hither and thither about the country. 632:** Baadey-ku-Ba--literally \"a gathering of winds.\" 634:* See also \"Magic and Mesmerism,\" a novel reprinted by the Harpers, thirtyyears ago.
