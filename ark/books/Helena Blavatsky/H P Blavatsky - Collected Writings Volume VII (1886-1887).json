Sinnett , pp. 136-139] [In his Incide n ts in the Life of Madame Blavatsky (London: George Redway, 1886), A. P. Sinnett, writing on the subject of H.P.B.’s reaction to Richard Hodgson’s slanderous Report , says (p. 304): “The letters, memoranda, and protests on which she wasted her energies during this memorable fortnight were few, if any, of a kind that would have helped a cold and unsympathetic public to understand the truth of things, and it is not worth while to resuscitate them here. I induced her to tone down one protest into a presentable shape for insertion in a pamphlet I issued in the latter part of January (1886), and for the rest, few but her most intimate friends would correctly appreciate their fire and fury. . . .” Evidently, the statement reproduced below is the protest spoken of by Sinnett, before it was “toned down.” It was originally published with the above title in The Letters of H. P. Blavatsky to A. P. Sinnett (New York: Frederick A. Stokes, 1924), pp. 136-139. It was written by H.P.B. on or about January 1st, 1886, as it is directly connected with her letter to A. P. Sinnett bearing this date and dealing with Hodgson’s Report just then received by her. Immediately following it, we publish the “toned down” version, reproduced from A. P. Sinnett’s pamphlet entitled The “ Occult World Phenomena ” and the Society for Psychical Research (London: George Redway, 1886. 60 pages).–– Compiler .] The long threatened report by Hodgson—the agent sent in 1884 by the S.P.R. to India to investigate certain phenomena alleged by the Coulombs to have been fraudulently produced by them at the instigation of the undersigned, who was directly and indirectly connected with such occult occurrences—has come out. The undersigned denies most solemnly the charges brought forward in the said Report against her, in addition to which—an implied fraud throughout—she is called in it more than once “forger” and a “Russian Spy.” 4  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS There is not in that voluminous report one single charge that could stand a legal investigation and be shown correct. All in it is personal inference, hypothesis and unwarranted assumptions and conclusions. Every sentence in it is arbitrary and libellous in the extreme, according to law—brutal and calumniating, in the sight of every unprejudiced witness acquainted with the facts that preceded the investigation and led to the Report. Only a few of the phenomena, those with which the Coulombs were well acquainted—are given in it in a distorted way, so as to meet the theory of Deception. The two thirds of the phenomena brought forward by the Theosophists, the most important as the most unanswerable are silently skipped over. Only, and in case they should be some day placed before the public as a counterproof—the witnesses to such are pelted with mud before hand, and an attempt is made to show them untrustworthy . The said Hodgson had come to India as a friend; he was received as one, lived in the greatest intimacy with those he now accuses of confederacy and lying. None, during the time he lived at Adyar regarded by all as a perfectly honourable man, had the remotest conception that much that was said by him in private"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"conversations, every idle word that no one thought at the time of weighing, would be later on made public, another sense given to it, and that his words would be made use of against the Society. Every facility was given to him for investigation—nothing concealed from him, as everyone felt and knew himself quite innocent of the absurd charges made. All this is now taken advantage of, and presented in an unfavourable light before the public. CONSIDERING ALL THIS, and that the said Hodgson and whoever may have sanctioned his indelicate proceedings and urged, or helped him on, has— (1) Given out in his Report nought but the evidence of malevolently disposed witnesses—bitter enemies for years; gossips, and long standing falsehoods invented by the Coulombs and his own personal inferences and made up theories; and that on the other hand he has unjustly TO THEOSOPHISTS AND MEN OF HONOUR  5 suppressed every title of evidence in my favour and where he could not make away with such testimony he has invariably tried to represent my witnesses and defenders as either dupes or confederates . (2) That besides the Coulomb letters, the full authorship of which I deny as I did on the day of their appearance, not one of which, moreover, was I permitted to see in the original; that besides these I say—( a ) a number of private letters or passages therefrom, isolated, and therefore liable to any construction—are published, such publication being actionable by law; (3) That a slip from a MS page, confessedly stolen, by the woman Coulomb from my writing desk years ago; evidently the translation from some passage in a Russian Daily, a number of articles from which I have been translating for the Pioneer , asked to do so by Mr. Sinnett in 1881-2-3. That again, that isolated fragment (not my composition evidently, as the quotation mark at the end of it happily left––shows) is reproduced with the manifest intention of throwing a vile suspicion upon me as being a “ Russian Spy .” (4) That the said Hodgson and his employers know the position I am in (having been repeatedly told the reasons why I could not prosecute the Coulombs, reasons known as well to every theosophist and that I am not ashamed to confess); and that knowing this—i.e. that I am utterly helpless and defenceless in England and India as a hated Russian and as a hated theosophist—they did not hesitate to take advantage of their position to dishonour with the utmost impunity a woman by branding her as a spy and a forger . (5) Considering also, that if I am unable to prove the reality of the phenomena produced in any Court of law, no more can Hodgson & Co. prove their unreality otherwise than on circumstantial evidence and their own prejudged ideas; but that the charge of my ever being a Spy could, on the other hand, be easily shown groundless, false and libellous; they still support their malicious allegations—just because they can do so with perfect impunity and that it suits them at the present moment , when all England rises 6  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS against and suspects Russia—as nothing can ruin me more efficiently in public opinion; this special charge, moreover, being the only one that could prove an anchor of salvation for their Report, as a motive had to be given for a series of frauds and deception covering ten years of incessant labour, poverty, struggles at the expense of health and the last money we had. Considering all this, and much more, what is the conclusion an honest man can arrive at, who, acquainted with the real facts , reads their Report? Assuredly the following: the accusations, all Mr. Hodgson’s cleverness notwithstanding, could not stand unless a logical motive could be found for such disgusting dishonourable course as the one I am charged with. The true motive—publicly and openly professed gave the lie to all such accusations; it weakened thoroughly if it did not destroy utterly the filthy charges. Why not present those charges in a light that best calculated to have them accepted without one word of protest by the public in general? This could be perpetrated with impunity and it only ruins me for"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"life alone. It only shuts the doors before me, back to my home where I thought of dying in peace knowing I had done my duty the best I could. What does it matter to the Honourable professors at Cambridge that an old Russian woman has not but one course opened to her: to die a disgraced beggar , far from all she loves and cares for in this life, so long as they can satisfy their spite and punish those who refused to recognise in Mr. Hodgson, an infallible expert and in themselves as infallible leaders in things psychic and phenomenal. Well they have probably done all this: let them triumph in their iniquity . This is an action that every honest man or woman must and will regard as simply infamous . Thus, considering finally, !that if the Report is an alleged expression of the writer’s great integrity, of his mistaken, yet sincere and honest views (which I now deny), that it might have been published in toto in order to set off his extraordinary acuteness and still lose nothing in strength of deduction and inferences if TO THEOSOPHISTS AND MEN OF HONOUR  7 the direct charge of forgery and spying —(the terms “forger” and “spy”) had been even laid aside; but that it was not done for reasons above given, and the libellous and incriminating terms are there published for the whole world to see and accept; considering all this I, the undersigned, now call upon every truth and justice loving Englishman and Englishwoman in the United Kingdom of Great Britain—whose righteous laws command to regard as innocent even a criminal before he is found by that law “guilty”—to show to me reasons why the said Hodgson and his employers should not be proclaimed publicly and in print by me as having been guilty of a mean , cowardly , base and a brutal action ; one to stoop to which no gentleman , no honest man of even an average honourability would ever stoop to, in view of the existing circumstances. In view of all the above I pray the London Lodge Theosophical Society to permit the undersigned, putting the present in a more grammatical and documentary form, to print and publish it and send it to every theosophist throughout the world; also to have the same published in The Theosophist . So long as I have not broken altogether from the Theosophical Society and am connected with it; so long as any of my actions can by reacting upon it hurt the Cause or one of the Societies, I shall take no action that is not sanctioned by all the Councils. But if this is refused to me and I have to go about to the end of my life with the triple brand of Fraud , Forger and Spy upon me like a female Cain, helpless and powerless to even prove that the latter accusation is an infamous, uncalled for lie and a calumny, then it will remain for me but to take another course from which there will be no more return possible. H. P. BLAVATSKY. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME VII 1886 8  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS MADAME BLAVATSKY’S PROTEST [From a Pamphlet entitled The “ Occult World Phenomena” and the Society for Psychical Research , by A. P. Sinnett, London: George Redway, 1886, pp. 49-53.] The “Society for Psychical Research” have now published the Report made to one of their Committees by Mr. Hodgson, the agent sent out to India to investigate the character of certain phenomena, described as having taken place at the Headquarters of the Theosophical Society in India and elsewhere, and with the production of some of which I have been directly or indirectly concerned. This Report imputes to me a conspiracy with the Coulombs and several Hindus to impose on the credulity of various persons around me by fraudulent devices, and declares to be genuine, a series of letters alleged to be written by me to Mme. Coulomb in connection with the supposed conspiracy, which letters I have already myself declared to be in large part fabrications. Strange to say, from the time the investigation was begun, fourteen months ago, and to this day, when I am declared guilty by my self-instituted judges, I was never permitted to see those incriminating letters. I draw the attention of every fair-minded and honourable Englishman to this fact. Without at present going into a minute examination of the errors, inconsistencies, and bad reasoning of this Report, I wish to make as publicly as possible my indignant and emphatic protest against the gross aspersions thus put upon me by the Committee of the Psychic Research Society at the instigation of the single, incompetent, and unfair inquirer whose conclusions they have accepted. There is no charge against me in the whole of the present Report that could stand the test of an impartial inquiry on the spot, where my own explanations could be checked by the examination of witnesses. They have been developed in Mr. Hodgson’s own mind, and kept back from my friends and colleagues while he remained at Madras abusing the hospitality and unrestrained assistance in his inquiries supplied to him at the Headquarters of the Society at Adyar, where he took up the attitude of a MADAME BLAVATSKY’S PROTEST  9 friend, though he now represents the persons with whom he thus associated—as cheats and liars. These charges are now brought forward supported by the one-sided evidence collected by him, and when the time has gone by at which even he could be confronted with antagonistic evidence and with arguments which his very limited knowledge of the subject he attempted to deal with do not supply him. Mr. Hodgson having thus constituted himself prosecutor and advocate in the first instance, and having dispensed with a defence in the complicated transactions he was investigating, finds me guilty of all the offences he has imputed to me in his capacity as judge, and declares that I am proved to be an arch-impostor. The Committee of the P.R.S. have not hesitated to accept the general substance of the judgment which Mr. Hodgson thus pronounces, and have insulted me publicly by giving their opinion in favour of their agent’s conclusions—an opinion which rests wholly and solely on the Report of their single deputy. Wherever the principles of fairness and honourable care for the reputation of slandered persons may be understood, I think the conduct of the Committee will be regarded with some feeling resembling the profound indignation of which I am sensible. That Mr. Hodgson’s elaborate but misdirected inquiries, his affected precision, which spends infinite patience over trifles and is blind to facts of importance, his contradictory reasoning and his manifold incapacity to deal with such problems as those he endeavoured to solve, will be"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"exposed by other writers in due course—I make no doubt. Many friends who know me better than the Committee of the P.R.S. will remain unaffected by the opinions of that body, and in their hands I must leave my much abused reputation But one passage in this monstrous Report I must, at all events, answer in my own name. Plainly alive to the comprehensive absurdity of his own conclusions about me as long as they remained totally unsupported by any theory of a motive which could account for my life-long devotion to my Theosophical work 10  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS at the sacrifice of my natural place in society in my own country, Mr. Hodgson has been base enough to concoct the assumption that I am a Russian political agent, inventing a sham religious movement for the sake of undermining the British Government in India! Availing himself, to give colour to this hypothesis, of an old bit of my writing, apparently supplied to him by Mme. Coulomb, but which he did not know to be as it was, a fragment of an old translation I made for The Pioneer from some Russian travels in Central Asia, Mr. Hodgson has promulgated this theory about me in the Report, which the gentlemen of the P.R.S. have not been ashamed to publish. Seeing that I was naturalised nearly eight years ago a citizen of the United States, which led to my losing every right to my pension of 5,000 roubles yearly as the widow of a high official in Russia; that my voice has been invariably raised in India to answer all native friends that bad as I think the English Government in some respects—by reason of its unsympathetic character—the Russian would be a thousand times worse; that I wrote letters to that effect to Indian friends before I left America on my way to India, in 1879; that every one familiar with my pursuits and habits and very undisguised life in India, is aware that I have no taste for or affinity with politics whatever, but an intense dislike to them; that the Government of India, which suspected me as a spy because I was a Russian when I first went to India, soon abandoned its needless espionnage , and has never, to my knowledge, had the smallest inclination to suspect me since—the Russian spy theory about me which Mr. Hodgson has thus resuscitated from the grave, where it had been buried with ridicule for years, will merely help to render his extravagant conclusions about me more stupid even than they would have been otherwise in the estimation of my friends and of all who really know me. But looking upon the character of a spy with the disgust which only a Russian who is not one can feel, I am impelled irresistibly to repudiate Mr. Hodgson’s groundless and infamous calumny with a concentration of the general contempt his method of procedure in this inquiry seems MADAME BLAVATSKY’S PROTEST  11 to me to merit, and to be equally deserved by the Committee of the Society he has served. They have shown themselves, by their wholesale adoption of his blunders, a group of persons less fitted to explore the mysteries of psychic phenomena than I should have thought—in the present day, after all that has been written and published on the subject of late years—could have been found among educated men in England. Mr. Hodgson knows, and the Committee doubtless share his knowledge, that he is safe from actions for libel at my hands, because I have no money to conduct costly proceedings (having given all I ever had to the cause I serve), and also because my vindication would involve the examination into psychic mysteries which cannot be dealt fairly with in a court of law; and again because there are questions which I am solemnly pledged never to answer, but which a legal investigation of these slanders would inevitably bring to the front, while my silence and refusal to answer certain queries would be misconstrued into “contempt of court.” This condition of things explains the shameless attack that has been made upon an almost defenceless woman, and the inaction in face of it to which I am so cruelly condemned.

[This remarkable article is mentioned by H.P.B. in a letter she wrote to A. P. Sinnett from Würzburg, Ge r many. The letter is undated. Mary K. Neff provisionally dates it as of November, 1885. It was originally published in The Letters of H. P . Blavatsky to A. P. Sinnett (New York: Frederick A. Stokes; London: T. Fisher Unwin Ltd., 1925), pp. 243-244. It begins with the following words: “ Sent to Mohini art: ‘Have animals Souls’ to correct. Ask him to bring it to you and see pp. he was told to show to you. There you shall find in the Sishtas (or remnants) spoken how near the truth came our mutual friend A.P.S. in his ‘Noah’s Ark Theory’.” While it may not be possible any longer to ascertain the correct date when this article was written, it is safe to assume that it must have been penned by H.P.B. sometime in the Fall of 1885. It was in August of that year that she moved to Würzburg. All references appearing in footnotes within square brackets are added by the Compiler, as a help to students. H.P.B. frequently quotes from one of the best known works of the Marquis Eudes de Mirville, entitled Pneumatologie — Des Esprits et de leurs Manifestations Diverses .

Many are the “antiquated religious superstitions” of the East which Western nations often and unwi s ely deride: but none is so laughed at and practically set at defiance as the great respect of Oriental people for animal life. Flesh -eaters cannot sympathize with total abstainers from meat. We Europeans are nations of civilized barbarians with but a few millenniums between ourselves and our cave-dwelling forefathers who sucked the blood HAVE ANIMALS SOULS?  13 and marrow from uncooked bones. Thus, it is only natural that those who hold human life so cheaply in t h eir frequent and often iniquitous wars, should entirely disregard the death-agonies of the brute creation, and daily sacrifice millions of innocent, harmless lives; for we are too epicurean to devour tiger steaks or crocodile cutlets, but must have tender lambs and golden-feathered pheasants. All this is only as it should be in our era of Krupp"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"cannons and scientific vivisectors. Nor is it a matter of great wonder that the hardy European should laugh at the mild Hindu, who shudders at the bare thought of killing a cow, or that he should refuse to sympathize with the Buddhist and Jain, in their respect for the life of every sentient creature—from the elephant to the gnat. But, if meat-eating has indeed become a vital necessity —“the tyrant’s plea”!—among Western nations; if hosts of victims in every city, borough and village of the civilized world must needs be daily slaughtered in temples dedicated to the deity, denounced by St. Paul and worshipped by men “whose God is their belly”:—if all this and much more cannot be avoided in our “age of Iron,” who can urge the same excuse for sport? Fishing, shooting, and hunting, the most fascinating of all the “amusements” of civilized life—are certainly the most objectionable from the standpoint of occult philosophy, the most sinful in the eyes of the followers of these religious systems which are the direct outcome of the Esoteric Doctrine—Hinduism and Buddhism. Is it altogether without any good reason that the adherents of these two religions, now the oldest in the world, regard the animal world—from the huge quadruped down to the infinitesimally small insect—as their “younger brothers,” however ludicrous the idea to a European? This question shall receive due consideration further on. Nevertheless, exaggerated as the notion may seem, it is certain that few of us are able to picture to ourselves without shuddering the scenes which take place early every morning in the innumerable shambles of the 14  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS so-called civilized world, or even those daily enacted during the “shooting season.” The first sun-bea m has not yet awakened slumbering nature, when from all points of the compass myriads of hecatombs are being prepared to salute the rising luminary. Never was heathen Moloch gladdened by such a cry of agony from his victims as the pitiful wail that in all Christian countries rings like a long hymn of suffering throughout nature, all day and every day from morning until evening. In ancient Sparta—than whose stern citizens none were ever less sensitive to the delicate feelings of the human heart—a boy, when convicted of torturing an animal for amusement, was put to death as one whose nature was so thoroughly villainous that he could not be permitted to live. But in civilized Europe—rapidly progressing in all things save Christian virtues— might remains unto this day the synonym of right . The entirely useless, cruel practice of shooting for mere sport countless hosts of birds and animals is nowhere carried on with more fervour than in Protestant England, where the merciful teachings of Christ have hardly made human hearts softer than they were in the days of Nimrod, “ the mighty hunter before the Lord.” Christian ethics are as conveniently turned into paradoxical syllogisms as those of the “heathen.” The writer was told one day by a sportsman that since “not a sparrow falls on the ground without the will of the Father,” he who kills for sport—say, one hundred sparrows—does thereby one hundred times over—his Father’s will!"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"A wretched lot is that of poor brute creatures, hardened as it is into implacable fatality by the hand of man. The rational soul of the human being seems born to become the murderer of the irrational soul of the animal—in the full sense of the word, since the Christian doctrine teaches that the soul of the animal dies with its body . Might not the legend of Cain and Abel have had a dual signification? Look at that other disgrace of our cultured age—the scientific slaughter-houses called “vivisection rooms.” Enter one of those halls in Paris, and behold Paul Bert, or some other of these men—so justly called “the learned HAVE ANIMALS SOULS?  15 butchers of the Institute”—at his ghastly work. I have but to translate the forcible description of an eye-witness, one who has thoroughly studied the modus operandi of those “executioners,” a well-known French author: [Vivisection] is a specialty of the scientific slaughter-houses in which torture , scientific a lly economised by our butcher-academicians, is applied during whole days, weeks, and even months to the fibres and muscles of one and the same victim. It [torture] makes use of every and any kind of weapon, performs its analysis before a pitiless audience, divides the task every morning between ten apprentices at once, of whom one works on the eye, another one on the leg, the third on the brain, a fourth on the marrow; and whose inexperienced hands succeed, nevertheless, towards night after a hard day’s work, in laying bare the whole of the living carcass they had been ordered to chisel out, and that in the evening is carefully stored away in the cellar, in order that early next morning it may be worked upon again if only there is a breath of life and sensibility left in the victim! We know that the trustees of the Grammont law ( loi ) have tried to rebel against this abomination; but Paris showed herself more inexorable than London and Glasgow.* And yet these gentlemen boast of the grand object pursue d , and of the grand secrets discovered by them. “Horror and lies!”––exclaims the same author. In the matter of secrets—a few localisations of faculties and cerebral motions excepted—we know but of one secret tha t belongs to them by rights: it is the secret of torture eternalised , besides which the terrible natural law of autophagy (mutual manducation), the horrors of war, the merry massacres of sport, and the sufferings of the animal under the butcher’s knife—are as nothing! Glory to our men of science! They have surpassed every former kind of torture, and remain now and for ever, without any possible contestation, the kings of artificial anguish and despair!† The usual plea for butchering, killing, and even for legally torturing animals—as in vivisection— i s a verse or two in the Bible, and its ill-digested meaning, disfigured by the so-called scholasticism represented by Thomas –––––––––– * Eudes de Mir ville, Des Esprits , etc., Vol. VI, Appendix G, pp. 160-61. † Ibid , p. 161. –––––––––– 16  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Aquinas. Even de Mirville, that ardent defender of the rights of the church, calls such texts— . . . . . . Biblical tolerances, forced from Go d after the deluge, as so many others, and based upon the decadence of our strength.* However this may be, such texts are amply contradicted by others in the same Bible. The meat-eater, t he sportsman and even the vivisector—if there are among the last named those who believe in special creation and the Bible––generally quote for their justification that verse in Genesis in which God gives dual Adam—“dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth” (i, 28); hence—as the Christian understands it—power of life and death over every animal on the globe. To this the far more philosophical Brahman and Buddhist might answer: “Not so. Evolution starts to mould future humanities within the lower scales of being. Therefore by killing an animal, or even an insect, we arrest the progress of an entity towards its final goal in nature—MAN”; and to this the student of occult philosophy may say “Amen,” and add that it not only retards the evolution of that entity, but arrests that of the next succeeding human and more perfect race to come. Which of the opponents is right, which of them the more logical? The answer depends mainly, of course, on the personal belief of the intermediary chosen to decide the questions. If he believes in special creation—so-called—then in answer to the plain question—“Why should homicide be viewed as a most ghastly sin against God and nature, and the murder of millions of living creatures be regarded as mere sport?”—he will reply:— “Because man is created in God’s own image and looks upward to his Creator and to his birth-place—heaven ( os homini sublime dedit ),† and that the gaze of the animal –––––––––– * L o c . c it. † [ O v id , Metamorphoses, lib.

Moreover, “the Lord God formed"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"man of the dust of the ground” (ii, 7); and “dust” is surely earth pulverized? Solomon, the king and preacher, is most decidedly an authority and admitted on all hands to have been the wisest of the Biblical sages; and he gives utterances to a series of truths in Ecclesiastes (ch. iii) which ought to have settled by this time every dispute upon the subject. “The sons of men . . . . might see that they themselves are beasts” (iii, 18) . . . . “that which befalleth the sons of men, befalleth the beasts . . . . . a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast” (iii, 19) . . . “all go into one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again” (iii, 20) . . . . “ who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upwards , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downwards to the earth?” (iii, 21). Indeed, “who knoweth!” At any rate it is neither science nor “school divine.” Were the object of these lines to preach vegetarianism on the authority of Bible or Veda, it would be a very easy task to do so. For, if it is quite true that God gave dual Adam—the “male and female” of Chapter I of Genesis —who has little to do with our henpecked ancestor of Chapter II—“dominion over every living thing,” yet we nowhere find that the “Lord God” commanded that Adam or the other to devour animal creation or destroy it for sport. Quite the reverse. For pointing to the 1 8   BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS vegetable kingdom and the “fruit of a tree yielding seed”—God says very plainly: “to you [men] it shall b e for meat ” (i. 29). So keen was the perception of this truth among the early Christians that during the first centuries they never touched meat. In Octavius Tertullian writes to Minucius Felix: . . . . . . . we are not permitted either to witness, or even hear narrated ( novere ) a hom ic ide, we Christians , who refuse to taste dishes in which animal blood may have been mixed .* But the writer does not preach vegetarianism, simply defending “animal rights” and attempting to s how the fallacy of disregarding such rights on Biblical authority.

The passage quoted by H.P.B. constitutes the last sentence of Chapter xxx of Octavius .

It would be vain to tell him that unless he accepts not only the verses quoted for his justification but the whole mass of contradictions and seeming absurdities in it—he will never obtain the key to the truth; for he will not believe it. Yet the whole Bible teems with charity to men and with mercy and love to animals. The original Hebrew text of Chapter xxiv of Leviticus is full of it. Instead of the verse 18 as translated in the Bible: “And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast,” in the original it stands: “Life for life,” or rather “soul for soul,” nephesh tachat nephesh .* And if the rigour of the law did not go to the extent of killing, as in Sparta, a man’s “soul” for a beast’s “soul”––still, even though he replaced the slaughtered soul by a living one, a heavy additional punishment was inflicted on the culprit. But this was not all. In Exodus (xx, 10, and xxiii, 11-12) rest on the Sabbath day extended to cattle and every other animal. “The seventh day is the sabbath . . . . thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy . . . . cattle”; and the Sabbath year , “the seventh year thou shalt let it [the land] rest and lie still . . . . that thine ox and thine ass may rest”—which commandment, if it means anything, shows that even the brute creation was not excluded by the ancient Hebrews from a participation in the worship of their deity, and that it was placed upon many occasions on a par with man himself. The whole question rests upon the misconception that “soul,” nephesh , is entirely distinct from “spirit”— ruach . And yet it is clearly stated that “God breathed into the nostrils (of man) the breath of life and man became a living soul,” nephesh , neither more or less than an animal, for the soul of an animal is also called nephesh.

It is not the humble writer of the present article who says so, but no less an authority for every good Christian than that king of the preachers—St. Paul. Our opponents who so indignantly refuse to listen to the arguments of either modern or esoteric science may perhaps lend a more willing ear to what their own saint and apostle has to say on the matter; the true interpretation of whose words, moreover, shall be given neither by a theosophist nor an opponent, but by one who was as good and pious a Christian as any, namely, another saint—John Chrysostom—he who explained and commented upon the Pauline Epistles, and who is held in the highest reverence by the divines of both the Roman Catholic and the Protestant churches. Christians have already found that experimental science is not on their side; they may be still more disagreeably surprised upon finding that no Hindu could plead more earnestly for animal life than did St. Paul in writing to the Romans. Hindus indeed claim mercy to the dumb brute only on account of the doctrine of transmigration and hence of the sameness of the principle or element that animates both man and brute. St. Paul goes further: he shows [ Rom ., viii, 21] the animal hoping for , and living in the expectation of the same deliverance “ from the bondage of corruption ” as any good Christian. The precise. expressions of that great apostle and philosopher will be quoted later on in the present Essay and their true meaning shown. The fact that so many interpreters—Fathers of the Church and scholastics—tried to evade the real meaning of St. Paul is no proof against its inner sense, but rather against the fairness of the theologians whose inconsistency HAVE ANIMALS SOULS?  21 will be shown in this particular. But some people will support their propositions, however erroneous, to t h e last. Others, recognizing their earlier mistake, will, like Cornelius a Lapide, offer the poor animal amende honorable . Speculating upon the part assigned by nature to the brute creation in the great drama of life, he says: The aim of all creatures is the service of man. Hence, together with him [their master] they are waiting for their reno v ation ( cum homine renovationem suam exspectant ).* “Serving” man, surely cannot mean being tortured, killed, uselessly shot and otherwise misused; whil e it is almost needless to explain the word “renovation.” Christians understand by it the renovation of bodies after the second coming of Christ; and limit it to man, to the exclusion of animals. The students of the Secret Doctrine explain it by the successive renovation and perfection of forms on the scale of objective and subjective being, and in a long series of evolutionary transformations from animal to man, and upward. This will, of course, be again rejected by Christians with indignation. We shall be told that it is not thus that the Bible was explained to them, nor can it ever mean that.

It is the purpose of the present Essay to throw a ray of light upon this most serious and interesting subject. Roman Catholic writers in order to support the genuineness of the many miraculous resurrections of animals produced by their saints, have made them the subject of endless debates. The “soul in animals” is, in the opinion of Bossuet, “the most difficult as the most important of all philosophical questions.” Confronted with the doctrine of the Church that animals, though not soulless, have no permanent or immortal soul in them, and that the principle which animates them dies with the body, it becomes interesting to learn how the school-men and the Church divines reconcile this statement with that other claim that animals may be and have been frequently and miraculously resurrected.

Its object, at any rate, is to show that however absurd the notion that either man or brute can be resurrected after the life-principle has fled from the body for ever, such resurrections—if they were true—would not be more impossible in the case of a dumb brute than in that of a man; for either both are endowed by nature with what is so loosely called by us “soul,” or neither the one nor the other is so endowed. –––––––––– II [ The Theosophist , Vol. VII, No. 77, February, 1886, pp. 295-302] “What a chime r a is man! what a confused chaos, what a subject of contradiction! a professed ju d ge of all things, and yet a feeble worm of the earth! the great depository and guardian of truth, and yet a mere huddle of uncertainty! the glory and the scandal of the universe!”—P ASCAL .

Before the final and decisive blow is dealt to that selfish doctrine, which has become so pregnant with cruel and merciless practices toward the poor animal world, the reader must be made acquainted with the early hesitations of the Fathers of the Patristic age themselves, as to the right interpretation of the words spoken with reference to that question by St. Paul.

They agree, nevertheless, upon one point: namely, that physical, exact research offers no grounds for the presumption that man is endowed with an immortal, divine soul, any more than his dog. Thus, while the Asiatic Evolutionists behave toward animals consistently with their scientific and religious views, neither the church nor the materialistic school of science is logical in the practical applications of their respective theories. The former, teaching that every living thing is created singly and specially by God, as any human babe may be, and that it finds itself from birth to death under the watchful care of a wise and kind Providence, allows –––––––––– * It is but jus tic e to acknowledge here that De Mirville is the first to recognize the error of the Church in this particular, and to defend animal life, as far as he dares do so. –––––––––– HAVE ANIMALS SOULS?   25 the inferior creation at the same time only a temporary soul.

Nor does one find among those great materialists who were religiously inclined men any who have shown themselves consistent and logical in defining the true moral status of the animal on this earth and the rights of man over it.

As already stated, the Church exacts belief in the miracles performed by her great Saints. Among the various prodigies accomplished we shall choose for the present only those that bear directly upon our subject—namely, the miraculous resurrections of dead animals. Now one who credits man with an immortal soul independent of the body it animates can easily believe that by some divine miracle the soul can be recalled and forced back into the tabernacle it deserts apparently forever. But how can one accept the same possibility in the case of an animal, since his faith teaches him that the animal has no independent soul, since it is annihilated with the body? For over two hundred years, ever since Thomas of Aquinas, the Church has authoritatively taught that the soul of the brute dies with its organism. What then is recalled back into the clay to reanimate it? It is at this juncture that scholasticism steps in, and—taking the difficulty in hand—reconciles the irreconcilable. 26  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS It premises by saying that the miracles of the Resurrection of animals are numberless and as well aut h enticated as “the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.”* The Bollandists give instances without number. As Father Burigny, a hagiographer of the 17th century, pleasantly remarks concerning the bustards resuscitated by St. Remi— I may be told, no doubt, that I am a goose myself to give credence to such “blue bird “ tales. . . . I shall answer the joker, in such a case, by saying that, if he disputes this point, then must he also strike out from the life of St. Isidore of Spain† the statement that he resuscitated from death his master’s horse; from the biography of St. Nicholas of Tolentino––that he brought back to life a partridge, instead of eating it; from that of St. Francis—that he recovered from the blazing coals of an oven, where it was baking, the body of a lamb, which he forthwith resurrected; and that he also made boiled fishes, which he resuscitated, swim in their sauce. . . . . Above all he [the sceptic] will have to charge more than one hundred thousand eye-witnesses—among whom at least a few ought to be allowed some common sense—with being either liars or dupes.‡ A far higher authority than Father Burigny, namely? Pope Benedict (Benoit) XIV, corroborates and affirms the above evidence. The names, moreover, as eye-witnesses to the resurrections, of Saint Sylvestrus, François de Paule, Severin of Cracow and a host of others are all mentioned in the Bollandists. “Only he adds,” says Cardinal de Ventura who quotes him— . . . . .that, as resurrection, however, to deserve the name requires the identical and numerical reproduction of the form,§ as much as of the material of the dead creature; and as that form (or soul) of the brute is always annihilated with its body according to St. Thomas’ doctrine, God, in every such case finds himself obliged to create for the purpose of the miracle a new form for the resurrected animal; ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"* De Beatificatione , etc., by Pope Benedict XIV.

Howev e r, although the difficulty is not absolutely explained, the following is made clear: the principle, that animated the animal during its life, and which is termed soul, being dead or dissipated after the death of the body, another soul—“a kind of an informal soul”—as the Pope and the Cardinal tell us—is created for the purpose of miracle by God; a soul, moreover, which is distinct from that of man, which is “an independent, ethereal and everlasting entity.” Besides the natural objection to such a proceeding being called a “miracle” produced by the saint, for it is simply God behind his back who “creates” for the purpose of his glorification an entirely new soul as well as a new body, the whole of the Thomasian doctrine is open to objection. For, as Descartes very reasonably remarks: If the soul of the animal is distinct from its body (and is therefore immaterial), we believe it hardly possible not to recognize it as spiritual , and therefore intelligent. † The reader need hardly be reminded that Descartes held the living animal as being simply an automaton, a “well wound up clock-work,” according to Malebranche. One, therefore, who adopts the Cartesian theory about the animal would do as well to accept at once the views of the modern materialists.

Man is endowed with reason, the infant with instinct; and the young animal shows more of both than the child. Indeed, everyone of the disputants knows as well as we do that it is so. If any materialist avoid confessing it, it is through pride. Refusing a soul to both man and beast, he is unwilling to admit that the latter is endowed with intelligence as well as himself, even though in an infinitely lesser degree. In their turn the churchman, the religiously inclined naturalist, the modern metaphysician, shrink from avowing that man and animal are both endowed with soul and faculties, if not equal in development and perfection, at least the same in name and essence. Each of them knows, or ought to know that instinct and intelligence are two faculties completely opposed in their nature, two enemies confronting each other in constant conflict; and that, if they will not admit of two souls or principles, they have to recognize, at any rate, the presence of two potencies in the soul, each having a different seat in the brain, the localization of each of which is well known to them, since they can isolate and temporarily destroy them in turn—according to the organ or part of the organs they happen to be torturing during their terrible vivisections.

All the living and moving souls [ nephesh or life principle] come from the earth; but, let me be understood, not solely from the dust, of which their bodies as well as our own were made, but from the potency of theearth; i.e ., from its immaterial force , as all forces are . . . . . . . in conjunction with those of the sea , of the air , etc., all of which are those Elementary Principalities (principautés élémentaires) of which we have spoken elsewhere (namely, in Des Esprits , etc., 2nd Mémoire, chap. xii, Cosmolâtrie).* What the Marquis Eudes de Mirville understands by the term is, that every “Element” in nature is a d o main filled and governed by its respective invisible spirits. The Western Kabalists and the Rosicrucians named them Sylphs, Undines, Salamanders and Gnomes; Christian mystics, like de Mirville, give them Hebrew names and class each among the various kinds of Demons under the sway of Satan—with God’s permission, of course. He too rebels against the decision of St. Thomas who teaches that the animal soul is destroyed with the body. “It is a force”—he says—that “we are asked to annihilate, the most substantial force on earth, called animal soul ,” which, according to the Reverend Father Ventura, is “ the most respectable soul after that of man.”"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"He had just called it an immaterial force, and now it is named by him “the most substantial thing on earth.” † But what is this Force?

Leibnitz, the philosopher beloved by Bossuet, appeared to credit “Animal Resurrection” to a certain extent.

Both include all animal life in the hope of a new birth and renovation in a more perfect state when every creature that now “waiteth” shall rejoice in the “manifestation of the sons of God.” Because, as St. Paul explains: The creature itself ( ipsa ) also s h all be delivered from the bondage of corruption, which is to say that the seed or the indestructible animal soul, which does not reach Devachan while in its elementary or animal state, will get into a higher form and go on, together with man, progressing into still higher states and forms, to end, animal as well as man, in “the glorious liberty of the children of God” (viii, 21). And this “glorious liberty” can be reached only through the evolution or the Karmic progress of all creatures.

Yes, it is we, men, who have the “first-fruits of the Spirit,” or the direct Parabrahmic light, our Atma o r seventh principle, owing to the perfection of our fifth principle (Manas), which is far less developed in the animal. As a compensation, however, their Karma is far less heavy than ours. But that is no reason why they too should not reach one day that perfection that gives the fully evoluted man the Dhyanchohanic form. Nothing could be clearer—even to a profane, non-initiated critic—than those words of the great Apostle, whether we interpret them by the light of esoteric philosophy, or that of mediaeval scholasticism. The hope of redemption, or, of the survival of the spiritual entity delivered “from the bondage of corruption,” or the series of temporary material forms, is for all living creatures, not for man alone. But the “paragon” of animals, proverbially unfair even to his fellow-beings, could not be expected to give easy consent to sharing his expectations with his cattle and domestic poultry. The famous Bible commentator, Cornelius a Lapide, was the first to point out and charge his predecessors with the conscious and deliberate intention of doing all they could to avoid the application of the word creatura to the inferior creatures of this world. We learn from him that St. Gregory Nazianzen, Origen and St. Cyril (the one, most likely, who refused to see a human creature in Hypatia, and dealt with her as though she were a wild animal) insisted that the word creatura , in the verses above quoted, was applied by the Apostle simply to the angels! But, as remarks Cornelius, who appeals to St. Thomas for corroboration, . . . . . this opinion is too distorted and violent ( distorta et violen ta ) , it is moreover invalidated by the fact that the angels, as such, are already delivered from the bonds of corruption.

Cornelius contradicts the venerable father as coolly as he opposed his earlier brother-saints. “For,” says he, . . . . . in the text quoted the creatures spok e n of by the Apostle are evidently creatures distinct from men:— not only they but ourselves also ; and then, that which is meant is not deliverance from sin, but from death to come .* But even the brave Cornelius finally gets scared by the general opposition and decides that under the t erm creatures St. Paul may have meant—as St. Ambrosius, St. Hilarius (Hilaire) and others insisted–– elements (!!), i.e ., the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, etc., etc. Unfortunately for the holy speculators and scholastics, and very fortunately for the animals—if these are ever to profit by polemics—they are over-ruled by a still greater authority than themselves. It is St. John Chrysostom, already mentioned, whom the Roman Catholic Church, on the testimony given by Bishop Proclus, at one time his secretary, holds in the highest veneration. In fact St. John Chrysostom was, if such a profane (in our days) term can be applied to a saint, the “medium” of the Apostle to the Gentiles. In the matter of his Commentary on St. Paul’s Epistles, St. John is held as directly inspired by that Apostle himself, in other words as having written his comments at St. Paul’s dictation. This is what we read in those comments on the 8th Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans . We must always groan about the delay made for our emigration [death]; for if, as saith the Apostle, the creature deprived of reason [ mente , not anima , “Soul”] and speech ( nam si hoc creatura mente et verbo carens ) groans and expects, the more the shame that we ourselves should fail to do so. † –––––––––– * C o r n e liu s , e d it.

The intrinsic characteristics of it, however, the nature of the teachings treated upon, and the general “atmosphere” of the article strongly suggest H.P.B.’s authorship. It is extremely doubtful that Col. Olcott would have ever written in this style. The student is invited to judge for himself. –– Compiler .] Sir,— “R. R.” attempts in the October number of our Magazine to prove that I have taught in Isis Unveiled substantially the doctrine of Vi ś ishtadvaita, to which view I take exception. I am quite aware of the fact that Isis is far from being as complete a work as, with the same materials, it might have been made by a better scholar; and that it lacks a symmetry, as a literary production, and perhaps here and there accuracy. But I have some excuse for all that. It was my first book; it was written in a language foreign to me—in which I had not been accustomed to write; the language was even more unfamiliar to certain Asiatic philosophers who rendered assistance; and, finally, Colonel Olcott, who revised the manuscript and worked with me throughout, was then—in the years 1875 and 1876—almost entirely ignorant of Aryan Philosophy, and hence unable to detect and correct such errors as I might so readily fall into when putting my thoughts into English. Still, despite all this, I think ISIS UNVEILED AND THE VI Ś ISHTÂDVAITA  51 “R. R.’s” criticism is faulty. If I erred in making too little distinction between an Impersonal God, or Parabrahm, and a Personal God, I scarcely went to the length of confounding the one with the other completely. The pages (Vol. II, 116-17; and 153; and pref., p. 2) that he relies upon, represent not my own doctrine but the ideas of others. The first two are quotations from Manu, and show what an educated Brahman and a Buddhist might answer to Prof. Max Müller’s affirmation that Moksha and Nirvana mean annihilation; while the third (Vol. II, p. 153) is a defence and explanation of the inner sense of the Bible, as"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"from a Christian mystic’s standpoint. Of course this would resemble Viśishtadvaitism , which, like Chr istianity, ascrib es personal attributes to the Universal Principle. As for the reference to the Preface, it seems that even when read in the dead-letter sense, the paragraph could only be said to reflect my personal opinion and not the Esoteric Doctrine. A sceptic in my early life, I had sought and obtained through the Masters the full assurance of the existence of a principle (not Personal God)—“a boundless and fathomless ocean” of which my “soul” was a drop. Like the Adwaitis, I made no difference between my Seventh Principle and the Universal Spirit, or Parabrahm; nor did, or do I believe in an individual, segregated spirit in me, as a something apart from the whole. And see, for proof, my remark about the “omnipotence of man’s immortal spirit”—which would be a logical absurdity upon any theory of egoistic separation. My mistake was that throughout the whole work I indifferently employed the words Parabrahm and God to express the same idea: a venial sin surely, when one knows that the English language is so poor that even at this moment I am using the Sanskrit word to express one idea and the English one for the other! Whether it be orthodox Adwaita or not, I maintain as an occultist, on the authority of the Secret Doctrine, that though merged entirely into Parabrahm, man’s spirit while not individual per se , yet preserves its distinct individuality in Paranirvana, owing to the accumulation in it of the aggregates, or 52  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS skandhas that have survived after each death, from the highest faculties of the Manas. The m o s t s p i r i t u a l — i .e. , the highest and divinest aspirations of every personality follow Buddhi and the Seventh Principle into Devachan ( Swarga ) after the death of each personality along the line of rebirths, and become part and parcel of the Monad. The personality fades out, disappearing before the occurrence of the evolution of the new personality (rebirth) out of Devachan: but the individuality of the spirit-soul [dear, dear, what can be made out of this English!] is preserved to the end of the great cycle ( Maha-Manwantara ) when each Ego enters Paranirvana, or is merged in Parabrahm. To our talpatic, or mole-like, comprehension the human spirit is then lost in the One Spirit, as the drop of water thrown into the sea can no longer be traced out and recovered. But de facto it is not so in the world of immaterial thought. This latter stands in relation to the human dynamic thought, as, say, the visual power through the strongest conceivable microscope would to the sight of a half-blind man: and yet even this is a most insufficient simile—the difference is “inexpressible in terms of footpounds.” That such Parabrahmic and Paranirvanic “spirits,” or units, have and must preserve their divine (not human) individualities, is shown in the fact that, however long the “night of Brahma” or even the Universal Pralaya (not the local Pralaya affecting some one group of worlds) yet, when it ends, the same individual Divine Monad resumes its majestic path of evolution, though on a higher, hundredfold perfected and more pure chain of earths than before, and brings with it all the essence of compound spiritualities from its previous countless rebirths. Spiral evolution, it must be remembered, is dual, and the path of spirituality turns, corkscrew-like, within and around physical, semi-physical, and supra-physical evolution. But I am being tempted into details which had best be left for the full consideration which their importance merits to my forthcoming work, The Secret Doctrine. H. P. B LAVATSKY.

P. Blavatsky to A. P. Sinneft , p. 158, this “Fable” is attributed to Dr. Franz Hartmann. See Compiler’s Note at end of this text.] Once upon a time, in a country far across the Indian ocean, there was a society of people who wan t ed to hear and investigate the music of the spheres. They called their society “Harmony,” but there was very little harmony among them; on the contrary, they quarrelled a great deal amongst each other, for, their society was made up of men and women of different nationalities, different characters and different opinions. But to make up for this deficiency, they had in their possession a musical instrument, upon which—if it was properly tuned—the music of the spheres could be heard. This instrument however was almost constantly out of tune, and the winds from the four corners of the earth would then blow into it and it would give forth on such occasions very discordant sounds. To attune it, it was necessary that a great Genius from the upper spheres should descend and put it in order, so that the music of the spheres could be heard. It was indeed a very queer instrument, and what is still more remarkable about it, is the fact, which will hardly be believed by sensible people, that if a person whose mind was very inharmonious, would come near it, it would begin to make a very disagreeable noise. The safe-keeping of that instrument was entrusted to the president of that society, and that president was so proud of its mysterious qualities, that he wanted to show it to everybody, and asked everybody to come and listen to the harmony of the spheres. Now there was a society of non-musical but learned men in a country not far from here, and the president of the harmonial society went to them and told them about his mysterious instrument. They however did not believe him and said that there was no such thing as a “music of the spheres.” The intrepid president however 54  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS insisted that there was, and he promised, that if they would send some one to look at that instrument, he w ould show them how it was constructed, and he would ask the great Genius of the upper spheres to come and play a tune—for their instruction and edification. Consequently the learned men of the West put their heads together and consulted with each other, and the result was that they selected a smart boy and asked him to go across the big water to look at the great Genius from the upper spheres, and to report the result of his observations to those whose heads had grown to be grey in the acquisition of scientific"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"opinions. The smart boy went and looked at the instrument, but when he came there it gave forth only discordant sounds, because his own soul was not in harmony with it, and the more he worked with it, the more discordant did it become. The president then took out his book of incantations and tried all kinds of conjurations to force the Genius from the upper spheres to come and play a tune for the smart boy, but the Genius would not come. So the smart boy took his travelling bag and went home again and told his fathers in learning, that he did not see the great Genius and did not hear the music of the spheres, and the learned men stuck their heads together a second time and consulted with each other, and the result was that they said the smart boy was wise and that the president of the harmonial society was—mistaken. Now, when the members of the harmonial society heard that important decision, they became very much distressed and they went and destroyed the instrument, because they said that if they could not have an instrument upon which the music of the spheres could be heard at all times, they would rather have no instrument at all. Consequently the society dissolved and the members went their way, some of them attempted to attune their own souls to the harmony of the spheres, others believed that the great Genius had never existed; but the keeper of the instrument sat down and wept bitterly.

They have desecrated the name (and names) of the “Genius of the Spheres,” and the Genii descend no more. The present trouble has arisen in consequence of such desecration. The Maha-Chohan of the 54-B  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Genii has foretold it four years ago. The chief President was warned repeatedly in the beginning by t h e voice of his “instrument”; it protested in vain, and finally it was swept along itself with the current of enthusiasm, and added its own voice to proclaiming things holy in public, and throwing pearls before swine, and casting that which was sacred to the dogs: the swine are now treading upon the pearls and the dogs are rending the givers. The light that shone in the Darkness which comprehended it not—is now out: Darkness has put its heavy extinguisher upon it. This would have never happened had the light been sacredly preserved in its own birth-place and sphere—India. But the veneration of her sons for that light was laughed down to scorn; it was called “hero-worship,” mocked and finally represented as a screen to hide unholy practices. The names of the Genii are now dragged into publicity and figure in full in the Report. None of the Presidents would listen to the sage advice to keep their knowledge of the Genii secret; and the holy names were prostituted publicly by every scoffer. K ARMA.

Be h old the sig n foreseen in a brighter future; the problem that will be the question of the forthcoming age, that every thoughtful, earnest father will be asking himself with regard to his children’s education in the XXth century. And let it be stated at once, that by “Occult Science” neither the life of a chela nor the austerities of an ascetic are here meant; but simply the study of that which alone can furnish the key to the mysteries of nature, and unveil the problems of the universe and of psycho-physical man––even though one should not feel inclined to go any deeper. Every new discovery made by modern science vindicates the truths of the archaic philosophy. The true occultist is acquainted with no single problem that esoteric science is unable to solve, if approached in the right direction; the scientific bodies of the West have as yet no phenomenon of natural science that they can fathom to its innermost depths, or explain in all its aspects. Exact science fails to do so—in this cycle, for reasons that will be given further on. Nevertheless the pride of the age, which revolts against the intrusion into the empire of science of old especially of transcendental—truths, is growing every year more intolerant. Soon the world will behold it soaring in the clouds of self-sufficiency like a new tower of Babel, to share, perchance, the fate of the Biblical monument. In a recent scientific work on Anthropology,* one can read the following: “It is then given to us, at last, to know [?], to grasp, to handle and measure the forces through which it is claimed, that God proceeded. . . . .

The mother turned pale. After that the little sensitive was heard very often associating sounds with colours. The melody played by the mother on the piano threw her into ecstasies of delight; she saw “such beautiful rainbows,” she explained, but when her aunt played, it was “fire-works and stars, brilliant stars shooting pistols— and then . . . bursting. . . .” The parents got frightened and suspected that something had gone wrong with the child’s brain.

In a large Russian city, on the banks of the Volga, stands an hospital with a lunatic asylum attached to it. There a poor woman was locked up for over twenty years —to the day of her death in fact—as a “harmless” though insane patient. No other proofs of her insanity could be found on the case-books than the fact that the splash and murmur of the river-waves produced the finest “God’s rainbows” for her; while the voice of the superintendent caused her to see “black and crimson”—the colours of the Evil one. About that same period, namely in 1840, something similar to this phenomenon was heralded by the French 58  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS papers. Such an abnormal state of feelings—physicians thought in those days—could be due but to one r e ason; such impressions whenever experienced without any traceable cause, denoted an ill-balanced mind, a weak brain—likely to lead its possessor to lunacy. Such was the decree of science. The views of the piously inclined, supported by the affirmations of the village curés , inclined the other way. The brain had nought to do with the “obsession” for it was simply the work or tricks of the much slandered “old gentleman” with cloven foot and shining horns. Both the men of learning and the superstitious “good women” have had somewhat to alter their opinions since 1840. Even in that early period and before the “Rochester” wave of spiritualism had swept over any considerable portion of civilized society in Europe, it was shown that the same phenomenon could be produced by means of various narcotics and drugs. Some bolder people, who feared neither a charge of lunacy nor the unpleasant prospect of being regarded as wards in “Old Nick’s Chancery,” made experiments and declared the results publicly. One was Théophile Gautier, the famous French author Few are those acquainted with the French literature of that day, who have not read the charming story told by that author, in which he describes the dreams of an opium-eater. To analyse the impressions at first hand, he took a large dose of hashish. “My hearing” he writes, “acquired marvellous capacities: I heard the music of the flowers ; sounds—green, red and blue—poured into my ears in clearly perceptible waves of smell and colour. A tumbler upset, the creaking of an arm-chair, a word whispered in the lowest tones vibrated and resounded within me like so many claps of thunder.

But if so catching, why should we not be permitted the b old and disrespectful suggestion that the biologists and physiologists of Dr. Charcot’s school, have themselves become hallucinated with the rather one-sided scientific idea that such phenomenal hallucinations are all due to Hysteria ? However it may be, whether a collective hallucination of our medical lights or the impotency of material thought, the simplest phenomenon—of the class accepted and verified by men of science in the year 1885—remains as unexplained by them, as it was in 1840. If, admitting for argument sake, that some of the common herd out of their great reverence—often amounting to fetich worship— for science and authority, do accept the dictum of the scientists that every phenomenon, every “abnormal” manifestation, is due to the pranks of epileptic hysteria , what shall the rest of the public do? Shall they believe that Mr. Eglinton’s self-moving slate pencil is also labouring under a fit of the same epilepsy as its medium—even though he does not touch it ? Or that the prophetic utterances of the seers, the grand inspired apostles of all ages and religions, were simply the pathological results of hysteria? Or again that the “miracles” of the Bible, those of Pythagoras, Apollonius and others—belong to the same family of abnormal manifestations, as the hallucinations of Dr. Charcot’s Mlle.

A new proof of it is now being given. It comes as a fresh corroboration from some recent investigations in France by learned “ specialists ” (?) with regard to the confusion made by their neurosists and psychomaniacs between colour and sound, “ musical impressions ” and colour impressions.

The most interesting accounts of colour-sound phenomena may, however, be found in La Nature (No. 620, April 18, 1885, pp. 306-07, and No. 626, May 30, 1885, pp. 406-08), in an article contributed by A. de Rochas who experimented with a certain gentleman whom he names “M.H.P.” The following is a short résumé of his experience. M.H.P. is a man of about 57 years of age, an advocate by profession, now living in one of the country faubourgs of Paris, a passionate amateur of natural sciences which he has studied very seriously, fond of music, though no musician himself, a great traveller and as great a linguist. M.H.P. had never read anything about that peculiar phenomenon that makes certain people associate sound with colour, but was subject to it from his very boyhood. Sound of every description had always generated in him the impression of colours. Thus the articulation of the vowels produces in his brain the following results:—The letter A —appears to him dark red; E— white; I —black; O —yellow; U —blue. The double-vowelled letters: Ai —chestnut colour; Ei— greyish white; Eu— light blue; Oi —dirty-yellow; Ou —yellowish. The consonants are nearly all of a dark grey hue; while a vowel, or a double vowel forming with a consonant a syllable, colours that syllable with its own tint. Thus, ba , ca , da are all of red-grey colour; bi , ci , di— ash coloured; bo , co , do— yellow grey, and so on. S ending a word and pronounced in a hissing way, like the Spanish words los campos , imparts to the syllable that precedes it a metallic glittering. The colour of the word depends thus on the colour of the letters that compose it, so that to M.H.P. human speech appears in the shape of many-coloured, or variegated ribbons coming out of persons’ mouths, the colours of which are determined by those of the vowels in the sentences, separated one from the other by the greyish stripes of the consonants. 64  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS The languages receive in their turn a common colouring from those letters that predominate i n each. For instance, the German, which abounds in consonants, forms on the whole the impression of a dark grey moss; French appears grey, strongly mixed with white; the English seems nearly black; Spanish is very much coloured especially with yellow and carmin-red tints; Italian is yellow, merging into carmin and black, but with more delicate and harmonious tints than the Spanish. A deep-toned voice impresses M.H.P. with a dark red colour which gradually passes into a chocolate hue; while a shrill, sonorous voice suggests the blue colour, and a voice between these two extremes changes these colours immediately into very light yellow. The sounds of instruments have also their distinct and special colours: the piano and the flute suggest tints of blue; the violin—black; and the guitar—silver grey, etc. The names of musical notes pronounced loudly, influence M.H.P. in the same manner"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"as the words. The colours of a singing voice and playing depend upon the voice and its compass and altitude, and upon the instrument played on. So it is with figures verbally pronounced; but when read mentally they reflect for him the colour of the ink they are written or printed with. The form, therefore, has nought to do with such colour phenomena. While these impressions do not generally take place outside of himself, but perform, so to say, on the platform of his brain, we find other sensitives offering far more curious phenomena than “M.H.P.” does. Besides Galton’s interesting chapter upon this subject, in his Inquiries into human faculty and its development , we find in the London Medical Record a sensitive describing his impressions in this wise: “As soon as I hear the sounds of a guitar, I see vibrating chords, surrounded by coloured vapours.” The piano produces the same: “coloured images begin to float over the keys.” One of OCCULT OR EX A CT SCIENCE?  65 Dr. Pedrono’s subjects in Paris * has always colour impressions outside of himself. “Whenever I he a r a chorus composed of several voices,” he says, “I feel a great number of coloured points floating over the heads of the singers. I feel them, for my eye receives no definite impression; nevertheless, I am compelled to look at them and while examining them I feel perplexed, for I cannot find those bright coloured spots where I look at them, or rather feel them.” Inversely, there are sensitives in whom the sight of colours evokes immediately that of sounds, and others again, in whom a triple phenomenon is produced by one special sense generating two other senses. A certain sensitive cannot hear a brass band without a taste “like copper in the mouth” during the performance, and seeing dark golden clouds. Science investigates such manifestations, recognizes their reality, and—remains powerless to explain them. “ Neurosis and hysteria ” is the only answer obtained, and the “ canine hallucinations” of the French academicians quoted in Isis [Vol. I, p. 178], have remained valid to this day as an explanation, or a universal solvent of all such phenomena. But it is only natural after all, that science should be unable to account at any rate for this particular phenomenon of light and sound , since its theory of light itself has never been fully verified, nor made complete to the present day. Let then our scientific opponents play for a while longer at “blindman’s buff” amongst phenomena, with no ground to stand upon but their eternal physiological hypotheses. The time is not perhaps far off when they shall be compelled to change their tactics or—confess themselves defeated by even such elementary phenomena as described above.

Mental correlations of the two senses of “sight” and “hearing “ were as common a fact in their days, as that of a man in our own seeing objective things before him with his eyes wide open at noon. Any student of Occultism, the youngest of chelas who has just begun reading esoterically his Vedas, can suspect what the real phenomenon means; simply— a cyclic return of human organisms to their primitive form during the 3rd and even the 4th Root Races of what is known as the Antediluvian periods. Everything conspires to prove it, even the study of such exact sciences as philology and comparative mythology. From the hoary days of antiquity, from the very dawn of the grand civilizations of those races that preceded our Fifth Race, and the traces of which now lie buried at the very bottom of the oceans, the fact in question was known. That which is now considered as an abnormal phenomenon, was in every probability the normal state of the antediluvian Humanity. These are no vain words, for here are two of the many proofs. In consequence of the abundant data gleaned by linguistic research, philologists are beginning to raise their voices and are pointing to some very suggestive, though as yet unexplained facts.

In Hymn X, 71, verse 4, we read: “One—though looking , sees not the speech ,"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"and the other seeing— does not hear it.” And again in verse 7th, in which a party of friends is represented as emulating each other in singing, they are charactered by the double epithet placed side by side: Akshavanta and Karnavanta , or “one finished with eyes” and “one furnished with ears.” The latter is natural—the singer has a good ear for music , and the epithet is comprehensible in view of the musical emulation. But what sense can the Akshavanta have in this case, with his good sight, unless there is a connection and a meaning in it that are not explained, because probably the hymn refers to days when sight and hearing were synonymous terms? Moreover, a philologist, a rising Orientalist,† tells us that “ the Sanskrit verbal root ARCH is used to denote two meanings—( a ) ‘to sing ,’ and ( b ) ‘to shine ,’ to radiate beams or rays.

Our sense of hearing developed only in the 3rd sub-race. Thus, if human “speech”—owing to that absence of the sense of hearing––was in the beginning even less than what we would call a whispered speech, for it was a mental articulation of sounds rather than anything else, something like the systems we now see worked out for the Deaf and Dumb, still it is easy to understand how, even from those early days, “speech” became associated with “sight,” or, in other words, people could understand each other and talk with the help of only sight and touch. “Sound is seen before it is heard”—says the Book of Kiu-ti.

I may conclude with the remark, that since our natural and still “ape-like” propensities make us dread, individually and collectively, to be thrown by public opinion out of that region where all the smaller bodies gravitate toward the luminary of our social solar system—Science and her authority—something has to be done to remedy such a disastrous state of things. I propose to show therefore, in my next, that as we are still only in the 5th subrace of the Parent race, and none of us shall live to see the 7th—when things shall mend naturally—that it is just as well not to hang our hopes on science, whether orthodox or semi-heretical. The men of science cannot help -the world to understand the rationale of phenomena, which for a little while longer in this cycle it will be quite impossible for them to account for, even to themselves. They can neither understand nor explain it, any more than anyone else can, who has not studied occultism and the hidden laws that govern nature and rule mankind. The men of science are helpless in this case, and it is unjust to charge them with malice, or even with unwillingness—as has been often done. Their rationality (taken in this case in the sense of intellectuality , not of reason ) can never permit them to turn their attention to occult study. Therefore it is useless to demand or expect from the learned men of our age that which they are absolutely incapable of doing for us, until the next cycle changes and transforms entirely their inner nature by “improving the texture” of their spiritual minds. OCCULT OR EX A CT SCIENCE?  71 II [ The Theosophist , Vol. VII, No . 80, May, 1886, pp. 481-494] It has already been remarked that neither the medical faculties, nor the scientific bodies of physicists , c ould ever explain the primum mobile or rationale of the simplest phenomenon, outside of purely physiological causes; and that, unless they turned for help to occultism, they would have to bite the dust before the XXth century was very old. This seems a bold assertion. Nevertheless, it is fully justified by that of certain medical celebrities: that no phenomenon is possible outside of physiological and purely physical causes. They might reverse this statement and say no final investigation is possible with the light of only physiological and physical causes. That would be correct. They might add that, as men of exact science, they could not employ other methods of investigation. Therefore, having conducted their experiments to a certain boundary, they would desist and declare their task accomplished. Then the phenomena might be passed on to transcendentalists and philosophers to speculate upon. Had they spoken in such a spirit of sincerity no one would have the right of saying that they had not done their duty: for they would have done the best they could under the circumstances, and, as will presently be shown, they could do no more.

And as all such abnormal cases, in order to be manifested to our physical as well as spiritual senses, in other words, to become objective, must always have their generating causes interblended between the two spheres or planes of existence, the physical and the spiritual, it is but natural 72  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS that a materialist should discern only those with which he is acquainted, and remain blind to any other. The f ollowing illustration will make this clear to every intellectual reader. When we speak of light, of heat and sound, and so on, what do we mean? Each of these natural phenomena exists per se. But for us it has no being independently of our senses, and exists only to that degree which is perceived by a sense corresponding to it in us. Without being in the least deaf or blind, some men are endowed with far less acute hearing and sight than their neighbours; and it is a well known fact that our senses can be developed and trained as well as our muscles by exercise and method. It is an old axiom that the sun needs an eye to manifest its light; and though the solar energy exists from the first flutter of our Manvantara and will exist to the first killing breath of Pralaya, still, if a certain portion of that energy did not call forth in us those modifications that we name perception of light, Cimmerian darkness would fill the Kosmos and we should be denying the very existence of the sun. Science makes a distinction between the two energies—that of heat and that of light. But the same science teaches us that the creature, or being, in which the corresponding external actions would cause a homogeneous modification, could not find any difference between heat and light. On the other hand, that the creature, or being, in which the dark rays of the solar spectrum would call forth the modifications that are produced in us by the bright rays, would see light there, where we saw nothing whatever. Mr. A. Butleroff, a professor of chemistry and an eminent scientist, gives us many instances of the above. He points to the observations made by Sir John Lubbock on the sense of colour in ants. It was found by that distinguished man of science, that ants do not allow their eggs to remain subjected to light, and carry them off immediately from a sun-lit spot to a dark place. But when a ray of red light is turned on those eggs (the larvae), the ants leave them untouched as though they were in OCCULT OR EX A CT SCIENCE?  73 "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"complete darkness: they place their eggs indifferently under a red light or in utter darkness. Red light is a non-existent thing for them: as they do not see it, it is for them darkness. The impressions made on them by bright rays are very weak, especially by those nearest to the red—the orange and yellow. To such rays, on the contrary, as light and dark blue and violet—they seem very impressionable. When their nests are lit partly with violet and partly with red rays, they transfer their eggs immediately from the violet onto the red field. To the ant, therefore, the violet ray is the brightest of all the spectral rays. Their sense of colour is therefore quite the opposite of the same sense in man. But this contrast is still more strengthened by another fact. Besides the rays of light, the solar spectrum contains, as everyone knows, the so-called heat rays (for red) and the chemical (for violet). We see however neither the one nor the other, but term both of them dark rays: while the ants perceive them clearly. For, as soon as their eggs are subjected to the action of those dark rays, the ants drag them from that (to us) quite obscure field onto the one lighted by the red rays: therefore, for them, the chemical ray is violet. Hence says the professor— Owing to such a peculiarity, the objects seen by the ants must appear to them quite different from what th e y s e e m to u s ; those insects find evidently in nature hues and colours of which we have not, nor can have, the slightest conception. Admit for one moment the existence in nature of such objects as would swallow up all the rays of the solar spectrum, and scatter only the chemical rays: these objects would remain invisible to us , while the ants would perceive them very well. And now, let the reader imagine for one moment the following: that there may be a possibility w i thin the powers of man, with the help of secret sciences, firstly of preparing an “object” (call it talisman if you will) which, detaining for a longer or shorter period the rays of the “solar spectrum” on some one given point, will cause the manipulator of it to remain invisible to all, because he places himself and keeps within the boundary of the 74  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS chemical “dark” rays; and secondly— reversing it, t o become enabled to see in nature by the help of those dark rays that which ordinary men, with no such “talisman” at hand, can never see with their natural, naked eye! This may be a simple supposition, or it may be a very serious statement, for all the men of science know. They protest only against that which is claimed to be supernatural, above or outside their Nature; they have no right to object to the acceptance of the supersensuous, if shown within the limits of our sensuous world. The same holds good in acoustics. Numerous observations have shown that ants are completely deaf to the sounds that we hear; but that is no reason why we should suppose that ants are deaf. Quite the reverse; for taking his stand on his numerous observations, the same scientist thinks it necessary to accept that the ants hear sounds, “only not those that are perceptible to us.”"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Every organ of hearing is sensitive to vibrations of a given rapidity, but in cases of different creatures such rapidities may very easily not coincide. And not only in the case of creatures quite different from us men, but even in that of mortals whose organizations are peculiar —abnormal as they are termed—either naturally, or through training.* Our ordinary ear, for instance, is insensible to vibrations surpassing 38,000 a second, whereas the auditive organ of not only ants but some mortals likewise— who know the way to secure the tympanum from damage , and that of provoking certain correlations in ether— may be very sensitive to vibrations exceeding by far the 38,000 in a second, and thus, such an auditive organ,— abnormal only in the limitations of exact science,—might naturally enable its possessor, whether man or ant, to enjoy sounds and melodies in nature, of which the ordinary tympanum gives no idea. “ There, where to our senses reigns dead silence, a thousand of the most varied and weird sounds –––––––––– * The case o f Kashmiri natives and especially girls who work on shawls is given in Isis [Vol. I, p. 211].

Even without trespassing on other and different spheres and planets, and keeping strictly within the boundaries of our globe, it becomes evident that there exist in it thousands upon thousands of things unseen, unheard, and impalpable to the ordinary human senses. But let us admit, only for the sake of argument, that there may be––quite apart from the supernatural—a science that teaches mortals what may be termed supersensuous chemistry and physics; in plainer language— alchemy and the metaphysics of concrete not abstract nature, and every difficulty will be removed. For, as the same Professor argues— If we see light there, where another being is plunged in darkness; and see nothing there, w h ere it experiences the action of the light waves; if we hear one kind of sounds and remain deaf to another kind of sounds, heard, nevertheless, by a tiny insect—is it not as clear as day, that it is not nature, in her, so to say, primeval nakedness, that is subject to our science and its analysis, but simply those modifications, feelings and perceptions that she awakens in us? It is in accordance with these modifications only that we can draw our conclusions about external things and nature’s actions, and thus create to ourselves the image of the world surrounding us. The same, with respect to every “ finite “ being: each judging of the external, only by the modifications that are created in him (or it) by the same. And this, we think, is the case with the materialist: he can judge psychic phenomena only by their e x ternal aspect, and no modification is, or ever can be, created in him, so as to open his insight to their spiritual aspect."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"–––––––––– * Scientific Letters , X. –––––––––– 76  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Notwithstanding the strong position of those several eminent men of science who, becoming conv i nced of the actuality of “spiritual” phenomena, so-called, have become spiritualists; notwithstanding that—like Professors Wallace, Hare, Zöllner, Wagner, Butleroff—they have brought to bear upon the question all the arguments their great knowledge could suggest to them—their opponents have had, so far always the best of them. Some of these do not deny the fact of phenomenal occurrences but they maintain that the chief point in the great dispute between the transcendentalists of spiritualism and the materialists is simply the nature of the operative force , the primum mobile of the power at work. They insist on this main point: the spiritualists are unable to prove that this agency is that of intelligent spirits of departed human beings , “so as to satisfy the requirements of exact science , or of the unbelieving public for the matter of that.” And, viewed from this aspect, their position is impregnable. The theosophical reader will easily understand that it is immaterial whether the denial is to the title of “spirit” pure and simple or to that of any other intelligent being, whether human, sub-human, or super-human, or even to a Force—if it is unknown to, and rejected a priori by science. For it seeks precisely to limit such manifestations to those forces only that are within the domain of natural sciences. In short, it rejects point blank the possibility of showing them mathematically to be that which the spiritualists claim them to be, insisting that they have been already demonstrated. It becomes evident, therefore, that the Theosophist, or rather the Occultist, must find his position far more difficult than even the spiritualist ever can, with regard to modern science. For it is not to phenomena per se that most of the men of science are averse, but to the nature of the agency said to be at work. If, in the case of “Spiritual” phenomena these have only the materialists against them, not so in our case. The theory of “ Spirits” has only to contend against those who do not believe in the survival of man’s soul. Occultism raises OCCULT OR EX A CT SCIENCE?  77 against itself the whole legion of the Academies; because, while putting every kind of “Spirits,” goo d , bad and indifferent, in the second place, if not entirely in the background, it dares to deny several of the most vital scientific dogmas; and in this case, the Idealists and the Materialists of Science, feel equally indignant; for both, however much they may disagree in personal views, serve under the same banner. There is but one science, even"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"though there are two distinct schools—the idealistic and the materialistic ; and both of these are equally considered authoritative and orthodox in questions on science. Few are those among us who clamoured for a scientific opinion expressed upon Occultism, who have thought of this, or realized its importance in this respect. Science, unless remodelled entirely, can have no hand in occult teachings. Whenever investigated on the plan of the modern scientific methods, occult phenomena will prove ten times more difficult to explain than those of the spiritualists pure and simple. It is, after following for nearly ten years, the arguments of many learned opponents who battled for and against phenomena, that an attempt is now being made to place the question squarely before the Theosophists. It is left with them, after reading what I have to say to the end, to use their judgment in the matter, and to decide whether there can remain one tittle of hope for us ever to obtain in that quarter, if not efficient help, at any rate a fair hearing in favour of the Occult Sciences. From none of their members—I say—not even from those whose inner sight has compelled them to accept the reality of the mediumistic phenomena. This is but natural. Whatever they be, they are men of the modern science even before they are spiritualists, and if not all, some of them at any rate would rather give up their connection with, and belief in, mediums and spirits, than certain of the great dogmas of orthodox, exact science. And they would have to give up not a few of these were they to turn Occultists and approach the threshold of THE MYSTERY in a right spirit of enquiry. 78  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS It is this difficulty that lies at the root of the recent troubles of Theosophy; and a few words upon the s ubject will not be out of season, the more so as the whole question lies in a nut-shell. Those Theosophists who are not Occultists cannot help the investigators, let alone the men of science. Those who are Occultists work on certain lines that they dare not trespass. Their mouth is closed; their explanations and demonstrations are limited. What can they do? Science will never be satisfied with a half-explanation. To know , to dare , to will and to remain silent —is so well known as the motto of the Kabbalists, that to repeat it here may perhaps seem superfluous. Still it may act as a reminder. As it is, we have either said too much , or too little . I am very much afraid it is the former. If so, then we have atoned for it, for we were the first to suffer for saying too much. Even that little might have placed us in worse difficulties hardly a quarter of a century ago. Science—I mean Western Science—has to proceed on strictly defined lines. She glories in her powers of observation, induction, analysis and inference. Whenever a phenomenon of an abnormal nature comes before her for investigation, she has to sift it to its very bottom, or let it go. And this she has to do, and she cannot, as we have shown,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"proceed on any other than the inductive methods based entirely on the evidence of physical senses. If these, aided by the scientific acumen , do not prove equal to the task, the investigators will resort to, and will not scruple to use, the police of the land, as in the historical cases of Loudun, Salem Witchcraft, Morzine, etc.: The Royal Society calling in Scotland Yard, and the French Academy her native mouchards , all of whom will, of course, proceed in their own detective-like way to help science out of difficulty. Two or three cases of “an extremely suspicious character” will be chosen, on the external plane of course, and the rest proclaimed of no importance, as contaminated by those selected. The testimony of eye-witnesses will be rejected, and the evidence of ill-disposed persons speaking on hearsay accepted as OCCULT OR EX A CT SCIENCE?  79 “unimpeachable.” Let the reader go over the 20 odd volumes of de Mirville’s and des Mousseaux’s w o rks, embracing over a century of forced enquiry into various phenomena by science, and he will be better able to judge the ways in which scientific, often honourable, men-proceed in such cases. What can be expected then, even from the idealistic school of science, whose members are in so small a minority. Laborious students they are, and some of them open to every truth and without equivocation. Even though they may have no personal hobbies to lose, should their previous views be shown to err, still there are such dogmas in orthodox science that even they would never dare to trespass. Such, for instance, are their axiomatic views upon the law of gravitation and the modern conceptions of Force, Matter, Light, etc., etc. At the same time we should bear in mind the actual state of civilized Humanity, and remember how its cultured classes stand in relation to any idealistic school of thought, apart from any question of occultism. At the first glance we find that two-thirds of them are honeycombed with what may be called gross and practical materialism. “The theoretical materialistic science recognizes nought but S UBSTANCE . Substance is its deity, its o n ly God.” We are told that practical materialism, on the other hand, concerns itself with nothing that does not lead directly or indirectly to personal benefit. “Gold is its idol,” justly observes Professor Butleroff* (a spiritualist, yet one who could never accept even the elementary truths of occultism, for he “cannot understand them”). “A lump of matter,” he adds, the beloved substance of the theoretical materialists, is transformed into a lump of mud in the unclean hands of ethical materialism. And if the former gives but little importance to inner (psychic) states that are not perfectly demonstrated by their exterior states, the latter disregards entirely the inner states of life. . . . . The spiritual aspect of life has no meaning for practical materialism, everything being –––––––––– * Scientific Letters , X. ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 80  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS summed up for it in the external. The adoration of this external finds its principal and basic justification in the dogma of materialism, which has legalized it. This gives the key to the whole situation. Theosophists or Occultists at any rate, have nothing then t o expect from materialistic Science and Society. Such a state of things being accepted for the daily routine of life—though that which interferes with the highest moral aspirations of Humanity cannot we believe live long—what can we do but look forward with our hopes to a better future? Meanwhile, we ought never to lose courage; for if materialism, which has depopulated heaven and the elements, and has chosen to make of the limitless Kosmos instead of an eternal abode a dark and narrow tomb, refuses to interfere with us, we can do no better than leave it alone. Unfortunately it does not. No one speaks so much as the materialists of the accuracy of scientific observation, of a proper use of one’s senses and one’s reason thoroughly liberated from every prejudice. Yet, no sooner is the same privilege claimed in favour of phenomena by one who has investigated them in that same scientific spirit of impartiality and justice, than his testimony becomes worthless. “Yet if such a number of scientific minds,” writes Prof. Butleroff “accustomed by years of training to the minutest observation and verification, testify to certain facts, then there is a prima facie improbability that they should be collectively mistaken.” “But they have and in the most ludicrous way,” answer his opponents; and this time we are at one with them. This brings us back to an old axiom of esoteric philosophy: “ nothing of that which does not exist somewhere, whether in the visible or invisible kosmos , can be reproduced artificially , or even in human thought. ” “What nonsense is this?” exclaimed a combative Theosophist upon hearing it uttered. “Suppose I think of an animated tower, with rooms in it and a human head, approaching and talking with me—can there be such a thing in the universe?”"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"ALFRED PERCY SINNETT 1840-1921 Reproduced from Isabel de Steiger’s Memorabilia. OCCULT OR EXACT SCIENCE?  81 “Or parrots hatching out of almond-shells?” said an-other sceptic. Why not?—was the answer—not on t his earth, of course. But how do we know that there may not be such beings as you describe—tower-like bodies and human heads—on some other planet? Imagination is nothing but the memory of preceding births—Pythagoras tells us. You may yourself have been such a “tower man” for all you know, with rooms in you in which your family found shelter like the little ones of the kangaroo. As for parrots hatching out of almond shells—no one could swear that there was no such thing in nature, in days of old, when evolution gave birth to far more curious monsters. A bird hatching out of the fruit of a tree is perhaps one of those countless words dropped by evolution so many ages ago, that the last whisper of its echo was lost in the Diluvian roar. “The mineral becomes plant, the plant an animal, an animal man,” etc. say the Kabbalists. Speaking of the evidence and the reliability of senses—even the greatest men of science got caught once upon a time, in not only believing such a thing, but in actually teaching it as a scientific fact—as it appears. “When was that?” was the incredulous question. “Not so far back, after all; some 280 years ago—in England.” The strange belief that there was a kind of a sea-fowl that hatched out of a fruit was not limited at the very end of the XVIth century to the inhabitants of English sea-port towns only. There was a time when most of the men of science firmly believed it to be a fact, and taught it accordingly. The fruit of certain trees growing on the sea shore—a kind of Magnolia—with its branches dipping generally in the water, had its fruits—as it was asserted—transformed gradually by the action of salt water into some special Crustacean formation, from which emerged in good time a living sea-bird, known in the old natural histories as the “Barnacle-goose.” Some naturalists accepted the story as"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"an undeniable fact. They observed and investigated it for several years, and the discovery was accepted and approved by the 82  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS greatest authorities of the day and published under the auspices of some learned society. One of such bel i evers in the “Barnacle-goose” was John Gerard, a botanist, who notified the world of the amazing phenomenon in an erudite work published in 1596. In it he describes it, and declares it “ a fact on the evidence of his own senses. ” “He has seen it himself,” he says, “ touched the fruit-egg day after day,” watched its growth and development personally, and had the good luck of presiding at the birth of one such bird. He saw first the legs of the chicken oozing out through the broken shell, then the whole body of the little Barnacle-goose “which begun forthwith swimming.” * So much was the botanist convinced of the truth of the whole thing, that he ends his description by inviting any doubter of the reality of what he had seen to come and see him, John Gerard, and then he would undertake to make of him an eye-witness to the whole proceeding. Robert Murray another English savant and an authority in his day, vouches for the reality of the transformation of which he was also an eye-witness.† And other learned men, the contemporaries of Gerard and Murray—Funck, Aldrovandi, and many others shared that conviction.‡ So what do you say to this “Barnacle-goose”? –––––––––– * From the Scie n tific Letters–– Letter XXIV, Against Scientific Evidence in the Question of Phenomena. † He speaks of that transformation in the following words, as translated from the Latin: “In every conch (or shell) that I opened, after the transformation of the fruits on the branches into shells, I found the exact picture in miniature in it of the sea-fowl: a little beak like that of a goose, well dotted eyes; the head, the neck, the breast, the wings, and the already formed legs and feet, with well marked feathers on the tail, of a dark colour, etc., etc.” ‡ It is evident that this idea was commonly held in the latter half of the 17th century, seeing that it found a place in Hudibras , which was an accurate reflection of the opinions of the day:—  “As barnacles turn Soland Geese  In the islands of the Orchades.”  [by Samuel Butler, Pt.

And no cause to l a u g h a t s u c h m i stakes of those early scientists. Before two hundred years are over our descendants will have far better opportunities to make fun of the present generations of the F.R.S. and their followers. But the opponent of phenomena who quoted the story about the “Barnacle-goose” is quite right there; only that instance cuts both ways, of course, and when one brings it as a proof that even the scientific authorities, who believe in spiritualism and phenomena, may have been grossly mistaken with all their observation and scientific training, we may reverse the weapon and quote it the other way; as an"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"evidence as strong that no “acumen” and support of science can prove a phenomenon “referable to fraud and credulity,” when the eye-witnesses who have seen it know it for a fact at least. It only shows that the evidence of even the scientific and well trained senses and powers of observation may be in both cases at fault as those of any other mortal, especially in cases where phenomenal occurrences are sought to be disproved. Even collective observation would go for nought, whenever a phenomenon happens to belong to a plane of being, called (improperly so in their case) by some men of science the fourth dimension of space; and when other scientists who investigate it lack the sixth sense in them, that corresponds to that plane. In a literary cross-firing that happened some years ago between two eminent professors, much was said of that now for ever famous fourth dimension. One of them, telling his readers that while he accepted the possibility of only the “terrestrial natural sciences,” viz ., the direct or inductive science, “or the exact investigation of those phenomena only which take place in our earthly conditions of space and time ,” says he can never permit himself to overlook the possibilities of the future. “I would remind my colleagues,” adds the Professor-Spiritualist, that our inferences from that which is already acquired by investigation, must go a great deal further than our s e n s u o u s p e r c eptions. The limits of sensuous knowledge must be subjected to constant enlargement, and those of deduction still more. Who shall dare to 84  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS draw those limits for the future ? . . . . . Existing in a three-dimensional space, we can conduct our investigations of, and make our observations upon, merely that which takes place within those three dimensions. But what is there to prevent us thinking of a space of higher dimensions and building a geometry corresponding to it? . . . . . Leaving the reality of a four-dimensional space for the time being aside, we can still . . . . . go on observing and watching whether there may not be met with occasionally on our three-dimensional world, phenomena that could only be explained on the supposition of a four-dimensional space. In other words, . . . . we ought to ascertain whether anything pertaining to the four-dimensional regions can manifest itself in our three-dime n sional world . . . . can it not be reflected in it? . . . . The occultist would answer, that our senses can most undeniably be reached on this plane, not only f rom a four-dimensional but even a fifth and sixth-dimensional world. Only those senses must become sufficiently spiritualized for it, in so far as it is our inner sense only that can become the medium for such a transmission. Like “the projection of an object that exists in a space of three dimensions can be made to appear on the flat surface of a screen of only two dimensions”—four-dimensional beings and things can be reflected in our three-dimensional world of gross matter. But, as it would require a skilful physicist to make his audience believe that the things “real as life” they see on his screen are not shadows but realities, so it would take a wiser one than any of us to persuade a man of science—let alone a crowd of scientific men—that what he sees reflected on our"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"three-dimensional “screen” may be, at times, and under certain conditions, a very real phenomenon, reflected from, and produced by “four-dimensional powers,” for his private delectation, and as a means to convince him. “Nothing so false in appearance as naked truth”—is a Kabbalistic saying;—“truth is often stranger than fiction”—is a world-known axiom. It requires more than a man of our modern science to realize such a possibility as an interchange of phenomena between the two worlds—the visible and the invisible. OCCULT OR EX A CT SCIENCE?  85 A highly spiritual, or a very keen impressionable intellect, is necessary to decipher intuitionally the real from the unreal, the natural from the artificially prepared “screen.” Yet our age is a reactionary one, hooked on the very end of the Cyclic coil, or what remains of it. This accounts for the flood of phenomena, as also for the blindness of certain people. What does materialistic science answer to the idealistic theory of a four-dimensional space? “How!” it exclaims, “and would you make us attempt, while circumscribed within the impossible circle of a three-dimensional space, to even think of a space of higher dimensions! But how is it possible to think of that, which our human thought can never imagine and represent even in its most hazy outlines? One need be quite a different being from a human creature; be gifted with quite a different psychic organization; one must not be a man, in short, to find himself enabled to represent in his thought a four-dimensional space, a thing of length, breadth, thickness and—what else?” Indeed, “what else?”—for no one of the men of science, who advocate it, perhaps only because they are sincere spiritualists and anxious to explain phenomena by the means of that space, seem to know it themselves. Is it the “passage of matter through matter”? Then why should they insist upon it being a “space” when it is simply another plane of existence— or at least that is what ought to be meant by it—if it means anything. We occultists say and maintain, that if a name is needed to satisfy the material conceptions of men on our low plane, let them call it by its Hindu name Mahar (or Maharloka)—the fourth world of the higher septenary, and one that corresponds to Rasatala (the fourth of the septenary string of the nether worlds)—the fourteen worlds that “sprung from the quintuplicated elements”; for these two worlds are enveloping, so to say, our present fourth-round world. Every Hindu will understand what is meant. Mahar is a higher world, or plane of existence rather; as that plane to which belongs the ant just spoken of, is perchance a 86  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" lower one of the nether septenary chains. And if they call it so—they will be right. Indeed, people s peak of this four-dimensional space as though it were a locality—a sphere instead of being what it is––quite a different state of Being. Ever since it came to be resurrected in people’s minds by Prof. Zöllner, it has led to endless confusion. How did it happen? By the means of an abstruse mathematical analysis a spiritual-minded man of science finally came to the laudable conclusion that our conception of space may not be infallible, nor is it absolutely proven that besides our three-dimensional calculations it is mathematically impossible that there are spaces of more or less dimensions in the wide Universe. But, as is well expressed by a sceptic— . . . . the confession of the possible existence of spaces of different dimensions than our own does not afford us (the high m a thematicians) the slightest conception of what those dimensions really are. To accept a higher “four-dimensional” space is like accepting infinitude: such an acceptation does not afford us the smallest help by which we might represent to ourselves either of these . . . . . . all we know of such higher spaces is, that they have nothing in common with our conceptions of space.” ( Scientific Letters. ) “ Our conception ” — means of cour s e the conception of materialistic Science, thus leaving a pretty wide margin for other less scientific, withal more spiritual, minds. To show the hopelessness of ever bringing a materialistic mind to realize or even conceive in the most remote and hazy way the presence among us, in our three-dimensional world of other higher planes of being, I may quote from the very interesting objections made by one of the two learned opponents,* already referred to, with regard to this “Space.” He asks: “Is it possible to introduce as an explanation of certain phenomena the action of such a factor, of which we know nothing certain, are ignorant even of its nature and its faculties?” –––––––––– * 1883–– Scientific Letters ––published in the Novoye Vremya . –––––––––– OCCULT OR EXACT SCIENCE?  87 Perchance, there are such, who may “know” something, who are not so hopelessly ignorant. If an o ccultist were appealed to, he would say—No; exact physical science has to reject its very being, otherwise that science would become metaphysical. It cannot be analyzed—hence explained, on either biological or even physiological data. Nevertheless, it might, inductively––as gravitation for instance, of which you know no more than that its effects may be observed on our three-dimensional earth. Again (1) “It is said” (by the advocates of the theory) “that we live unconditionally in our three-dimensional space! Perchance” ( unconditionally ) “just because we are able to comprehend only such space, and absolutely incapable, owing to our organization, to"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"realize it in any other, but a three-dimensional way!” (2) In other words, “even our three-dimensional space is not something existing independently , but represents merely the product of our understanding and perceptions.” To the first statement Occultism answers that those “incapable to realize” any other space but a three-dimensional one, do well to leave alone all others. But it is not “owing to our [human] organization,” but only to the intellectual organization of those who are not able to conceive of any other; to organisms undeveloped spiritually and even mentally in the right direction. To the second statement it would reply, that the “opponent” is absolutely wrong in the first, and absolutely right in the last portion of his sentence. For, though the “fourth dimension”—if we must so call it––exists no more independently of our perceptions and senses than our three-dimensional imagined space, nor as a locality, it still is , and exists for the beings evoluted and born in it as “a product of their understanding and their perceptions.” Nature never draws too harsh lines of demarcation, never builds impassable walls, and her unbridged “chasms” exist merely in the tame conceptions of certain naturalists. The two (and more) “spaces,” or planes of being, are sufficiently interblended to allow of a communication 8 8   BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS between those of their respective inhabitants who are capable of conceiving both a higher and a lower pla n e. There may be amphibian beings intellectually as there are amphibious creatures terrestrially. The objector to a fourth-dimensional plane complains that the section of high mathematics, known at present under the name of “Metamathematics,” or “Metageometry,” is being misused and misapplied by the spiritualists. They “seized hold of, and fastened to it as to an anchor of salvation.” His arguments are, to say the least, curious. “Instead of proving the reality of their mediumistic phenomena,” he says, they took to explaining them on the hypothesis of a fourth dimension. Do we see the hand of a Katie King, which disappea r s in “unknown space”—forthwith on the proscenium—the fourth dimension; do we get knots on a rope whose two ends are tied and sealed—again that fourth dimension. From this standpoint space is viewed as something objective. It is believed that there are indeed in nature three, four and five-dimensional spaces. But, firstly, by the means of mathematical analysis, we might arrive, in this way, at an endless series of spaces. Only think, what would become of exact sciences, if, to explain phenomena, such hypothetical spaces were called to its help. If one should fail, we could evoke another, a still higher one, and so on . . . . Oh, poor Kant! And yet we are told that one of his fundamental principles was—that our three-dim e nsional space is not an absolute one; and that “even in respect to such axioms as those of Euclid’s geometry, our knowledge and sciences can only be relatively exact and real.” But why should exact science be thought in danger only because spiritualists try to explain their phenomena on that plane? And on what other could they explain that which is inexplicable if we undertake to analyze it on the three-dimensional conceptions of"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"terrestrial science, if not by the fourth-dimensional conception? No sane man would undertake to explain the Daïmon of Socrates by the shape of the great sage’s nose, or attribute the inspiration of The Light of Asia to Mr. Edwin Arnold’s skull cap.

Nothing worse, we hope, than what became of OCCULT OR EX A CT SCIENCE?  89 science, after the Royal Society had accepted its modern theory of Light , on the hypot h esis of an universal Ether. Ether is no less “a product of our understanding” than Space is. And if one could be accepted, then why reject the other? Is it because one can be materialized in our conceptions, or shall we say had to be, since there was no help for it; and that the other, being useless as a hypothesis for the purposes of exact science, is not, so far? So far as the Occultists are concerned, they are at one with the man of strict orthodox science, when to the offer made “to experiment and to observe whether there may not occur in our three-dimensional world phenomena, explainable only on the hypothesis of the existence of a space of four dimensions,” they answer as they do. “Well”—they say—”and shall observation and experiment give us a satisfactory answer to our question concerning the real existence of a higher four-dimensional space? Or, solve for us a dilemma unsolvable from whatever side we approach it? How can our human observation and our human experiments, possible only unconditionally within the limits of a space of three dimensions, serve us as a point of departure for the recognition of phenomena which can be explained “ only if we admit the existence of a four-dimensional space ”? The above objections are quite right we think; and the spiritualists would be the only losers were they to ever prove the existence of such space or its interference in their phenomena. For see, what would happen. No sooner would it be demonstrated that—say, a ring does pass through solid flesh and emigrate from the arm of the medium on to that of the investigator who holds the two hands of the former; or again, that flowers and other material things are brought through closed doors and walls; and that, therefore, owing to certain exceptional conditions, matter can pass through matter—no sooner would the men of science get collectively convinced of the fact, than the whole theory of spirit agency and intelligent intervention would crumple to dust. The three-dimensional space would not be interfered with, for the 90  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS passage of one solid through the other does nothing to do away with even metageometrical dimensions, bu t matter would be probably endowed by the learned bodies with one more faculty, and the hands of the materialists strengthened thereby.

Shall the noblest aspirations of mankind after the knowledge of real spiritual existence on those planes of being that are now confused with the “four-dimensional space” be the nearer to solution, because exact science shall have admitted as a physical law the action of one man walking deliberately through the physical body of another man, or through a stone wall? Occult sciences teach us that at the end of the Fourth Race,* matter, which evolutes, progresses and changes, as we do along with the rest of the kingdoms of nature, shall acquire its fourth sense, as it acquires an additional one with every new Race. Therefore, to an Occultist there is nothing surprising in the idea that the physical world should be developing and acquiring new faculties—a simple modification of matter, new as it now seems to science, as incomprehensible as were at first the powers of steam, sound, electricity. . . But what does seem surprising is the spiritual stagnation in the world of intellect, and of the highest exoteric knowledge. However, no one can impede or precipitate the progress of the smallest cycle.

Ancient, historical Magic is thus reflecting itself upon the scientific records of our own all-denying century. It forces the hand and tires the brain of the scientist, laughing at his efforts to interpret its meaning in his own materialistic way, yet helps the occultist better to understand modern Magic, the rickety, weak grandchild of her powerful, archaic grandam. Hardly a hieratic papyrus exhumed along with the swathed mummy of King or Priest-Hierophant, or a weather-beaten, indecipherable inscription from the tormented sites of Babylonia or Nineveh, or an ancient tile-cylinder—that does not furnish new food for thought or some suggestive information to the student of Occultism. Withal, magic is denied and termed the “superstition” of the ignorant ancient philosopher. Thus, magic in every papyrus; magic in all the religious formulae; magic bottled up in hermetically-closed vials, many thousands of years old; magic in elegantly bound, modern works; magic in the most popular novels; magic in social gatherings; magic—worse than that, SORCERY—in the very air one breathes in Europe, America, Australia: the more civilized and cultured a nation, the more formidable and effective the effluvia of unconscious magic it emits and stores away in the surrounding atmosphere . . . Tabooed, derided magic would, of course, never be accepted under her legitimate name; yet science has begun dealing with that ostracised science under modern masks, and very considerably. But what is in a name? Because a wolf is scientifically defined as an animal of the genus canis , does it make of him a dog? Men of science may prefer to call the magic inquired into by Porphyry and explained by Iamblichus hysterical hypnosis , but that ANCIENT MAGI C IN MODERN SCIENCE  93 does not make it the less magic. The result and outcome of primitive Revelation to the earlier races b y their “ Divine Dynasties,” the kings-instructors , became innate knowledge in the Fourth race, that of the Atlanteans; and that knowledge is now called in its rare cases of “abnormal” genuine manifestation, mediumship. The secret history of the world, preserved only in far-away, secure retreats, would alone, if told unreservedly, inform the present generations of the powers that lie latent, and to most unknown, in man and nature. It was the fearful misuse of magic by the Atlanteans, that led their race to utter destruction, and—to oblivion. The tale of their sorcery and wicked enchantments has reached us, through classical writers, in fragmentary bits, as legends and childish fairy-tales, and as fathered on smaller nations. Thence the scorn for necromancy, goëtic magic, and theurgy. The “witches” of Thessaly are not less laughed at in our day than the modern medium or the credulous Theosophist. This is again due to sorcery , and one should never lack the moral courage to repeat the term; for it is the fatally abused magic that forced the adepts, “the Sons of Light,” to bury it deep, after its sinful votaries had themselves found a watery grave at the bottom of the ocean; thus placing it beyond the reach of the profane of the race that succeeded to the Atlanteans. It is, then, to sorcery that the world is indebted for its"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"present ignorance about it. But who or what class in Europe or America, will believe the report? With one exception, none; and that exception is found in the Roman Catholics and their clergy; but even they, while bound by their religious dogmas to credit its existence, attribute to it a satanic origin. It is this theory which, no doubt, has to this day prevented magic from being dealt with scientifically. Still, nolens volens , science has to take it in hand. Archaeology in its most interesting department—Egyptology and Assyriology—is fatally wedded to it, do what it may. For magic is so mixed up with the world’s history that, if the latter is ever to be written at all in its 94  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS completeness, giving the truth and nothing but the truth, there seems to be no help for it. If Archaeology c o unts still upon discoveries and reports upon hieratic writings that will be free from the hateful subject, then H ISTORY will never be written, we fear. One sympathis e s profoundly with, and can well imagine, the embarrassing position of the various savants and “F.R.S.’s,” of Academicians and Orientalists. Forced to decipher, translate and interpret old mouldy papyri, inscriptions on steles and Babylonian rhombs , they find themselves at every moment face to face with M AGIC ! Votive offerings, carvings, hieroglyphic s , incantations—the whole paraphernalia of that hateful “superstition”—stare them in the eyes, demand their attention, fill them with the most disagreeable perplexity. Only think what must be their feelings in the following case in hand. An evidently precious papyrus is exhumed. It is the postmortem passport furnished to the osirified soul * of a just-translated Prince or even Pharaoh, written in red and black characters by a learned and famous scribe, say of the IVth Dynasty, under the supervision of an Egyptian Hierophant—a class considered in all the ages and held by posterity as the most learned of the learned, among the ancient sages and philosophers. The statements therein were written at the solemn hours of the death and burial of a King-Hierophant, of a Pharaoh and ruler. The purpose of the paper is the introduction of the “soul” to the awful region of Amenti, before its judges, there where a lie is said to outweigh every other crime. The Orientalist carries away the papyrus and devotes to its interpretation days, perhaps weeks, of labour, only to find in it the following statement: “In the XIIIth year and the second month of Schomoo , in the 28th day of the same, we, the first High-priest of Ammon, the king of the –––––––––– * The reader need not be told that every soul newly-born into its cycle of 3000 years after the death of the body it animated, became in Egypt, an “Osiris,” was osirified , viz . , the personality became reduced to its higher principles, a spirit. –––––––––– ANCIENT MAGIC IN MODERN SCIENCE  95"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" gods, Penotman, the son of the delegate (or substitute)* for the High-priest Pion-kimoan, and the scribe of th e temple of Sosser-soo-khons and of the Necropolis Bootegamonmoo, began to dress the late Prince Oozirmari Pionokha, etc., etc., preparing him for eternity.

A considerable fragment of this translation has been preserved by Eusebius in the first book of his Praeparatio Evangelica (chaps. vi and x) He is mentioned by Athenaeus, Mochus and Porphyry, among the ancient writers, though our evidence for his actual existence is confined to the testimony of Philo of Byblus alone. The genuineness of his writings has been questioned by many scholars.

The first scene opens with King Cheops on his throne, surrounded by his sons, whom he commands to entertain him with narratives about hoary antiquity and the miraculous powers exercised by the celebrated sages and magicians at the Court of his predecessor. Prince Chefren then tells his audience how a magus during the epoch of Pharaoh Nebkha fabricated a crocodile out of wax and endowed him with life and obedience. Having been placed by a husband in the room of his faithless spouse, the crocodile snapped at both the wife and her lover, and seizing them carried them both into the sea. Another prince told a story of his grandfather, the parent of Cheops, Pharaoh S ENEFRU. Feeling seedy, he commanded a magician into his presence, who advised him as a remedy the spectacle of twenty beautiful maidens of the Court sporting in a boat on the lake near by. The maidens obeyed and the heart of the old despot was “refreshed.” But suddenly one of the ladies screamed and began to weep aloud. She had dropped into the water, 120 feet deep in that spot, a rich necklace. Then a magician pronounced a formula, called the genii of the air and water to his help, and plunging his hand into the waves brought back with it the necklace. The Pharaoh was greatly struck with the feat. He looked no more at the twenty beauties, “divested of their clothes, covered with nets, and with twenty oars made of ebony and gold”; but commanded that sacrifices should be made –––––––––– * Supposititiously–– during the XVIIIth Dynasty of kings, agreeably to Manetho’s Synchronistic Tables, disfigured out of recognition by the able Eusebius, the too clever Bishop of Caesarea. –––––––––– ANCIENT MAGIC IN MODERN SCIENCE  99 to the manes of those two magicians when they died. To this Prince Gardadathu remarked that the highest among such magicians never die , and that one of them lived to that day, more than a centenarian, at the town of Deyd-Snefroo; that his name was Deddy; and that he had the miraculous power of re-uniting cut-off heads to their bodies and recalling the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"whole to life, as also full authority and sway over the lions of the desert. He, Deddy, knew likewise where to procure the needed expensive materials for the temple of the God Thoth (the wisdom deity), which edifice Pharaoh Cheops was anxious to raise near his great pyramid. Upon hearing this, the mighty king Cheops expressed desire to see the old sage at his Court! Thereupon the Prince Gardadathu started on his journey, and brought back with him the great magician. After long greetings and mutual compliments and obeisance, according to the papyrus, a long conversation ensued between the Pharaoh and the sage, which goes on briefly thus:— “I am told, oh sage, that thou art able to re-unite heads severed from their bodies to the latter.” “I can do so, great King,”—answered Deddy. “Let a criminal be brought here, without delay,” quoth the Pharaoh. “Great King, my power does not extend to men. I can resurrect only animals,”—remarked the sage. A goose was then brought, its head cut off and placed in the east corner of the hall, and its body at the western side. Deddy extended his arm in the two directions in turn and muttered a magic formula. Forthwith the body of the bird arose and walked to the centre of the hall, and the head rolled up to meet it. Then the head jumped on the bleeding neck; the two were re-united; and the goose began to walk about, none the worse for the operation of beheading. The same wonderful feat was repeated by Deddy upon canaries and a bull. After which the Pharaoh desired to 100  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS be informed with regard to the projected Temple of Thoth. The sage-magic i an knew all about the old remains of the temple, hidden in a certain house at Heliopolis: but he had no right to reveal it to the king. The revelation had to come from the eldest of the three triplets of Rad-Dedtoo. “ The latter is the wife of the priest of the Sun, at the city of Saheboo. She will conceive the triplet-sons from the sun-god, and these children will play an important part in the history of the land of Khemi (Egypt), inasmuch as they will be called to rule it. The eldest, before he becomes a Pharaoh, will be High-priest of the Sun at the city of Heliopolis. “Upon hearing this, Pharaoh Cheops rent his clothes in grief: his dynasty would thus be overthrown by the son of the deity to whom he was actually raising a temple!”"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Here the papyrus is torn; and a large portion of it being missing, posterity is denied the possibility of learning what Pharaoh Cheops undertook in this emergency. The fragment that follows apprises us of that which is evidently the chief subject of the archaic record—the birth of the three sons of the sun-god. As soon as Rad-Dedtoo felt the pangs of childbirth, the great sun-god called the goddesses Isis, Nephthys, Mesehentoo, and Hekhtoo, and sent them to help the priestess, saying: She is in labour with my three sons who will, one day, be the rulers of this land. Help her, and they will raise temples for you, will make innumerable libations of wine and sacrifices.” The goddesses did as they were asked, and three boys, each one yard long and with very long arms ,* were born. Isis gave them their names and Nephthys blessed them, while the two other goddesses confirmed on them their glorious future. The three young men became eventually kings of the Vth Dynasty, their names being Ouserkath, Sagoorey and Kakäy. ––––––––––– * Long arms in Egypt meant as now in India, a sign of mahatma-ship, or adeptship. ––––––––––– ANCIENT MAGIC IN MODERN SCIENCE  101 After the goddesses had returned to their celestial mansions some great miracle occurred. The corn given t h e mother-goddesses returned of itself into the corn-bin in an out-house of the High-priest, and the servants reported that voices of invisibles were singing in it the hymns sung at the birth of hereditary princes, and the sounds of music, and dances belonging to that rite were distinctly heard. This phenomenon endangered, later on, the lives of the future kings—the triplets. A female slave having been punished once by the High-priestess, the former ran away from the house, and spoke thus to the assembled crowds: “How dare she punish me, that woman who gave birth to three kings? I will go and notify it to Pharaoh Cheops, our lord.” At this interesting place, the papyrus is again torn; and the reader left once more in ignorance of what resulted from the denunciation, and how the three boy-pretenders avoided the persecution of the paramount ruler.* –––––––––– * This is the m o re to be regretted—says the translator of the papyrus—that “legendary details, notwithstanding the contents of the Lepsius papyrus are evidently based upon the most ancient traditions; and as a matter of fact emanate from eye-witnesses and firsthand evidence.” The data in the papyrus are absolutely coincident with facts known, and agree with the discoveries made by Egyptology and the undeniable information obtained concerning the history and far away events of that “land of mystery and riddle,” as Hegel called it. Therefore we have no cause whatever to doubt the authenticity of the general narrative contained in our papyrus. It reveals to us, likewise, entirely new historical facts. Thus, we learn, first of all, that (Kefren or) Chephren was the son of Cheops; that the Vth Dynasty originated in the town of Saheboo; that its first three Pharaohs were three brothers—and that the elder of the triplets had been a solar High-priest at Heliopolis before ascending to the throne. Meagre as the details appear, they become quite important in the history of events removed from us by more than forty centuries. Finally, the Lepsius papyrus is an extremely ancient document, written in the old Egyptian tongue, while the events narrated therein may, for their originality (magic?), be placed on a par with the best Egyptian narratives translated and published by the famous Egyptologist and Archaeologist, Mr. Maspéro, in his work called Les contes populaires de l’Égypte ancienne. ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 102  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Another magical feat is given by Mariette Bey ( Monuments div e rs , etc., pl. 9, Persian epoch) * from a tablet in the Bulak Museum, concerning the Ethiopian kingdom founded by the descendants of the High-priests of Amon, wherein flourished absolute theocracy. It was the god himself, it appears, who selected the kings at his fancy, and “the stele 114 which is an official statement about the election of Aspalout, shows how such events took place.” (Jebel-Barkal.) The army gathered near the Holy Mountain at Napata, choosing six officers who had to join other delegates of state, proposed to proceed to the election of a king. “Come,” reads the inscribed legend, “Come, let us choose a master who would be like an irresistible young bull.” And the army began lamenting, sayin g : “Our master is with us, and we know him not as yet! How can we know him?” And everyone of them said to the other: “No one knows him, save Râ himself; may the god protect him from every harm wherever he may be! . . . .” Forthwith, the whole army of His Majesty exclaimed with one voice: “But there is that god Amon-Râ, of the Holy Mountain, and he is the god of Ethiopia! Let us go to him; let us not speak in ignorance of him, for the word spoken in ignorance of him is not good! Let him choose, who is the god of the kingdom of Ethiopia, since the days of Râ. He will guide us, as the Ethiopian kings are all his handiwork, and he gives the kingdom to the son whom he loves . . . .” This is what the entire army saith: “It is an excellent speech, in truth, a million of times.” Then the narrative shows the delegates duly purified, proceeding to the temple and prostrating t h emselves before the huge statue of Amon-Râ, while framing their request. The Ethiopian priests knew how to fabricate miraculous images, capable of motion and speech [to serve as vehicles for the gods]; it is an art they held from their Egyptian ancestors (Maspéro, Notes sur différents points de Grammaire et d’Histoire, dans le Recueil, t.

Simply the astral body, or the aerial simulacrum of the corpse or the mummy—that which in China is called the Houen, and in India the Bhût. Upon reading this papyrus to-day, an Orientalist is pretty sure to fling it aside in disgust, attributing the whole affair to the crass superstition of the ancients. Truly phenomenal and inexplicable must have been the dullness and credulity of that otherwise highly philosophical and civilized nation if it could carry on for so many consecutive ages, for thousands of years, such a system of mutual deception! A system whereby the people were deceived by the priests, the priests by their King-Hierophants, and the latter themselves were cheated by the ghosts, which were, in their turn, but “the fruits of hallucination.” The whole of antiquity, from Menes to Cleopatra, from Manu to Vikramaditya, from Orpheus down to the last Roman augur, were hysterical, we are told. This must have been so, if the whole were not a system of fraud. Life and death were guided by, and were under the sway of, sacred “conjuring.” For there is hardly a papyrus, though it be a simple document of purchase and sale, a deed belonging to daily transactions of the most ordinary kind, that has not Magic, white or black, mixed up in it. It looks as though sacred scribes EGYPTIAN MAG I C   107 of the Nile had purposely, and in a prophetic spirit of race-hatred, carried out the (to them) most unprofit a ble task of deceiving and puzzling the generations of a future white race of unbelievers yet unborn! Anyhow, the papyri are full of Magic, as are likewise the stelae. We learn, moreover, that the papyrus was not merely a smooth-surfaced parchment, a fabric made of Ligneous matter from a shrub, the pellicles of which superposed one over the other formed a kind of writing-paper [ De s Esprits, etc., Vol. V, p. 81]; but that the shrub itself, the implements and tools for fabricating the parchment, etc., were all previousl y subjected to a process of magical preparation—according to the ordinance of the Gods, who had taught that art, as they had all others, to their Priest-Hierophants. There are, however, some modern Orientalists who seem to have an inkling of the true nature of such things, and especially of the analogy and the relations that exist between the Magic of old and our modern-day phenomena. Chabas is one of these, for he indulges, in his translation of the “Harris” papyrus, in the following reflections: Without having recourse to the imposing ceremonies of the wand of Hermes, or to the obscure formulae of an unfatho m able mysticism, a mesmerizer in our own day will, by means of a few passes, disturb the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"organic faculties of a subject, inculcate the knowledge of foreign languages, transport him to a far-distant country, or into secret places, make him guess the thoughts of those absent, read in closed letters, etc. The antre of the modern sybil is a modest-looking room, the tripod of the pythoness has made room for a small round table, a hat, a plate, a piece of furniture of the most vulgar kind; only the latter is even superior to the oracle of antiquity [how does M.

As teratology is an essential part of general physiology now, so the pretended Occult Sciences occupy in the annals of humanity a place which is not without its importance, and deserve for more than one reason the attention of the philosopher and the historian.* Selecting the two Champollions, Lenormant, Bunsen, Vicomte de Rougé, and several other Egyptolo g ists to serve as our witnesses, let us see what they say of Egyptian Magic and Sorcery. They may get out of the difficulty by accounting for each “superstitious belief” and practice by attributing them to a chronic psychological and physiological derangement, and to collective hysteria, if they like; still facts are there, staring us in the face, from the hundreds of these mysterious papyri, exhumed after a rest of four, five, and more thousands of years, with their magical containments and evidence of ante-diluvian Magic. A small library, found at Thebes, has furnished fragments of every kind of ancient literature, many of which are dated, and several of which have thus been assigned to the accepted age of Moses. Books or manuscripts on ethics, history, religion and medicine, calendars and registers, poems and novels everything—may be had in that precious collection; and old legends—traditions of long forgotten ages (please to remark this: legends recorded during the Mosaic period)—are already referred to therein as belonging to an immense antiquity, to the period of the dynasties of Gods and Giants.

These funeral texts are generally written in hieratic characters. At the head of the papyrus is invariably placed a series of scenes, showing the defunct appearing before a host of Deities successively, who have to examine him. Then comes the judgment of the Soul, while the third act begins with the launching of that Soul into the divine light. Such papyri are often forty feet long.* The following is extracted from general descriptions. It will show how the moderns understand and interpret Egyptian (and other) Symbology. The papyrus of the priest Névo-loo (or Névolen), at the Louvre; may be selected for one case. First of all there is the bark carrying the coffin, a black chest containing the defunct’s mummy. His mother, Amenbem-Heb, and his sister, Huissannub, are near; at the head and feet of the corpse stand Nephthys and Isis clothed in red, and near them a priest of Osiris clad in his panther’s skin, his censer in his right hand, and four assistants carrying the mummy’s intestines. The coffin is received by the God Anubis (of the jackal’s head), from the hands of female weepers. Then the Soul rises from its mummy and the Khou (astral body) of the defunct. The former begins its worship of the four genii of the East, of the sacred birds, and of the spirit of Atmon as a ram. Brought into the “Palace of Truth,” the defunct is before his judges. While the Soul, a scarabaeus, stands in the presence of Osiris, his astral Khou is at the door. Much laughter is provoked in the West by the invocations to various Deities, presiding over each of the limbs of the mummy, and of the living human body.

The Indian Yogi who, in an exoteric work, is invited to drink a certain intoxicating liquor till he loses his senses, was also regarded as a drunkard representing his sect and class, until it was found that the Esoteric sense of that “spirit” was quite different; that it meant divine light, and stood for"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"the ambrosia of Secret Wisdom. The symbols of the dove and the lamb which abound now in Eastern and Western Christian Churches may also be exhumed long ages hence, and speculated upon as objects of present-day worship. And then some “Occidentalist,” in the forthcoming ages of high Asiatic civilization and learning, may write karmically upon the same as follows: “The ignorant and superstitious Gnostics and Agnostics of the sects of ’Pope’ and ’Calvin’ (the two monster Gods of the Dynamite-Christian period) adored a pigeon and a sheep!” There will be portable hand-fetishes in all and every age for the satisfaction and reverence of the rabble, and the Gods of one race will always be degraded into devils by the next one.

The psychostasy ( o r judgment of the Soul) is certainly a whole poem to him who can read it correctly and interpret the images therein. In that picture we see Osiris, the horned, with his sceptre hooked at the end—the original of the pastoral bishop’s crook or crosier—the Soul hovering above, encouraged by Tmei, daughter of the Sun of Righteousness and Goddess of Mercy and Justice; Horus and Anubis, weighing the deeds of the soul. One of these papyri shows the Soul found guilty of gluttony sentenced to be re-born on earth as a hog; forthwith comes the learned conclusion of an Orientalist, “This is an indisputable proof of belief in metempsychosis, of transmigration into animals ,” etc. Perchance the Occult law of Karma might explain the sentence otherwise. It may, for all our Orientalists know, refer to the physiological vice in store for the Soul when re-incarnated—a vice that will lead that personality into a thousand and one scrapes and mis-adventures. Tortures to begin with, then metempsychosis during 3,000 years as a hawk, an angel, a lotus-flower, a heron, a stork, a swallow, a serpent, and a crocodile: one sees that the consolation of such a progress was far from being satisfactory, argues De Mirville, in his work on the Satanic character of the Gods of Egypt.* Again, a simple suggestion may throw on this a great light. Are the Orientalists quite sure that they have read correctly the “metempsychosis during 3,000 years”?

The man w h o all his life acted hypocritically and passed for a good man, but had been in sober reality watching like a bird of prey his chance to pounce upon his fellow-creatures, and had deprived them of their property, will be sentenced by Karma to bear the punishment for hypocrisy and covetousness in a future life. What will it be? Since every human unit has ultimately to progress in its evolution, and since that “man” will be reborn at some future time as a good, sincere, well-meaning man, his sentence to be re-incarnated as a hawk may simply mean that he will then be regarded metaphorically as such. That, notwithstanding his real, good, intrinsic qualities, he will, perhaps during a long life, be unjustly and falsely charged with and suspected of greed and hypocrisy and of secret exactions, all of which will make him suffer more than he can bear. The law of retribution can never err, and yet how many such innocent victims of false appearance and human malice do we not meet in this world of incessant illusion, of mistake and deliberate wickedness. We see them every day, and they may be found within the personal experience of each of us. What Orientalist can say with any degree of assurance that he has understood the religions of old? The metaphorical language of the priests has never been more than superficially revealed, and the hieroglyphics have been very poorly mastered to this day.* What says Isis Unveiled on this question of Egyptian rebirth and transmigration, and does it clash with anything that we say now?

EGYPTIAN MAGIC   113 explains at the same time the allegory of the “Fall of man.” According to the Arabian descriptions, each of the seven chambers of the Pyramids––those grandest of all cosmic symbols—was known by the name of a planet. The peculiar architecture of the Pyramids shows in itself the drift of the metaphysical thought of their builders. The apex is lost in the clear blue sky of the land of the Pharaohs, and typifies the primordial point lost in the unseen universe from whence started the first race of the spiritual prototypes of man. Each mummy, from the moment that it was embalmed, lost its physical individuality in one sense; it symbolized the human race. Placed in such a way as was best calculated to aid the exit of the “soul,” the latter had to pass through the seven planetary chambers before it made its exit through the symbolical apex. Each chamber typified, at the same time, one of the seven spheres, and one of the seven higher types of physico-spiritual humanity alleged to be above our own. Every 3,000 years, the soul, representative of its race, had to return to its primal point of departure before it underwent another evolution into a more perfected spiritual and physical transformation. We must go deep indeed into the abstruse metaphysics of Oriental mysticism before we can realize fully the infinitude of the subjects that were embraced at one sweep by the majestic thought of its exponents.* This is all Magic when once the details are given; and it relates at the same time to the evolution of o u r seven Root-Races, each with the characteristics of its special guardian or “God,” and his Planet. The astral body of each Initiate, after death, had to reënact in its funeral mystery the drama of the birth and death of each Race—the past and the future—and pass through the seven “planetary chambers,” which, as said above, typified also the seven spheres of our Chain.

The Book of the Dead, far older than Genesis * or any other book of the Old Testament, shows it in every line. It is full of incessant prayers and exorcisms against the Black Art. Therein Osiris is the conqueror of the “aerial demons.” The worshipper implores his help against Matat, “from whose eye proceeds the invisible arrow.” This “invisible arrow” that proceeds from the eye of the Sorcerer (whether living or dead) and that “circulates throughout the world,” is the evil eye—cosmic in its origin, terrestrial in its effects on the microcosmical plane. It is not the Latin Christians whom it behooves to view this as a superstition. Their Church indulges in the same belief, and has even a prayer against the “arrow circulating in darkness.” The most interesting of all those documents, however, is the “Harris” papyrus, called in France “ le papyrus magique de Chabas,” as it was first translated by the latter. It is a manuscript written in hieratic characters, translated, commented upon, and published in 1860 by Monsieur Chabas, but purchased at Thebes in 1855 by Mr. A. C. Harris.

That oracle had been brought by the Pelasgians to Dodona more than fourteen centuries B.C. and left with the forefathers of the Hellenes, and its history is well-known and may be read in Herodotus. Jupiter, who loved the fair nymph of the ocean, Dodona, had ordered Pelasgus to carry his cult to Thessaly. The name of the God of that oracle at the temple of Dodona was Zeus Pelasgicos, the Zeuspater (God the Father), or as De Mirville explains: “It was the name par excellence, the name that the Jews held as the ineffable, the unpronounceable Name—in short, J AOH -P ATER , i.e ., ’ he who was, who is, and who will be ,’ otherwise th e E TERNAL .” And the author admits that A.

Does not Plutarch, thinking of what he had learned in his initiation, console himself for the loss of his wife ? Had he not obtained the certitude at the Mysteries of Bacchus that “the soul [spirit] remains incorruptible, and that there is a hereafter”?† . . . . Aristophanes went even farther: “All those who participated in the Mysteries,” he says, “led an innocent, calm, and holy life; they died looking for the light of the Elysian Fields [Devachan], while the rest could never expect anything but eternal darkness [ignorance?].‡ . . . . . And when one thinks about the importance attached by the States to the principle and the correct celebration of the Mysteries, to the stipulations made in their treaties for the security of their celebration, one sees to what degree those Mysteries had so long occupied their first and their last thought. It was the greatest among public as well as private preoccupations, and this is only natural, since according to Döllinger, “the Eleusinian Mysteries were viewed as the efflorescence of all the Greek religion, as the purest essence of all its conceptions.” § Not only conspirators were refused admittance therein, but those who had not denounced them; traitors, perjurers, debauchees || . . . . .. so that Porphyry could say that: “Our soul has to be at the moment of death as it was during the Mysteries, i.e ., exempt from passion, envy, hatred, or anger.”¶ Truly, Magic was considered a Divine Science which led to a participation in the attributes of the Divinity itself. –––––––––– * D e Legibus, II, xiv, 36.20"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"† Consolatio ad Apollonium .

Says Philo: The Mysteries were known to unveil the operations of nature and lead to the contemplation of celestial powers.* The p r odigies accomplished by the priests of theurgical magic are so well authenticated, and the evidence—if human testimony is worth anything at all—is so overwhelming, that, rather than confess that the Pagan theurgists far outrivalled the Christians in miracles, Sir David Brewster piously concedes to the former the greatest proficiency in physics, and everything that pertains to natural philosophy. Science finds herself in a very disagreeable dilemma. . . . “Magic,” says Psellus, “formed the last part of the sacerdotal science. It investigated the nature, power, and quality of everything sublunary; of the elements and their parts, of animals, of various plants and their fruits, of stones and herbs. In short, it explored the essence and power of everything. From hence, therefore, it produced its effects. And it formed statues [magnetized] which procure health, and made all various figures and things [talismans] which could equally become the instruments of disease as well as of health. Often, too, celestial fire is made to appear through magic, and then statues laugh and lamps are spontaneously enkindled.†24 This assertion of Psellus that Magic “made statues which procure health,” is now proven to the w o rld to be no dream, no vain boast of a hallucinated Theurgist. As Reuvens says, it becomes “history.” For it is found in the Papyrus Magique of Harris and on the votive stele just mentioned. Both Chabas and de Rougé state that: On the eighteenth line of this very mutilated monument is found the formula with regard to the acquiescence o f the God (Chons) who made his consent known by a motion he imparted to his statue.‡ There was even a dispute over it between the two Orientalists.

Excesses of power, abuse of knowledge and personal ambition very often led selfish and unscrupulous Initiates to black Magic, just as the same causes led to precisely the same thing among Christian popes and cardinals; and it was black Magic that led finally to the abolition of the Mysteries, and not Christianity, as is often erroneously thought. Read Mommsen’s Roman History, Vol. I, and you will find that it was the Pagans themselves who put an end to the desecration of the Divine Science. As early as 560 B.C. the Romans had discovered an Occult association, a school of black Magic of the most revolting kind; it celebrated mysteries brought from Etruria, and very soon the moral pestilence had spread all over Italy. More than seven thousand Initiates were prosecuted, and most of them were sentenced to death. . . . Later on, Titus - Livius shows us another three thousand Initiates sentenced during a single year for the crime of poisoning.* And yet black Magic is derided and denied! Pauthier may o r may not be too enthusiastic in saying that India appears to him as . . . . the grand and primitive hearth of human thought . . . . that has ended by embracing the whole ancient world. . . . . but he was right in his idea. That primitive thought led to Occult knowledge, which in our Fifth Race is reflected from the earliest days of the Egyptian Pharaohs down to our modern times. Hardly a hieratic papyrus is exhumed with the tightly swathed-up mummies of kings and high priests that does not contain some interesting information for the modern students of Occultism.

Nevertheless, Magic is so mixed up with the history of the world, that if the latter is ever to be written it has to rely upon the discoveries of Archaeology, Egyptology, and hieratic writings and inscriptions; if it insists that they must be free from that “superstition of the ages” it will never see the light. One can well imagine the embarrassing position in which serious Egyptologists, Assyriologists, savants and academicians find themselves. Forced to translate and interpret the old papyri and the archaic inscriptions on stelae and Babylonian cylinders, they find themselves compelled from first to last to face the distasteful, and to them repulsive, subject of Magic, with its incantations and paraphernalia. Here they find sober and grave narratives from the pens of learned scribes, made up under the direct supervision of Chaldaean or Egyptian Hierophants, the most learned among the Philosophers of antiquity. These statements were written at the solemn hour of the death and burial of Pharaohs, High Priests, and other mighty ones of the land of Chemi; their purpose was the introduction of the newly-born, Osirified SouI before the awful tribunal of the “Great Judge” in the region of Amenti—there where a lie was said to outweigh the greatest crimes. Were the Scribes and Hierophants, Pharaohs, and King-Priests all fools or frauds to have either believed in, or tried to make others believe in, such “cock-and-bull stories” as are found in the most respectable papyri? Yet there is no help for it. Corroborated by Plato and Herodotus, by Manetho and Syncellus, as by all the greatest and most trustworthy authors and philosophers who wrote upon the subject, those papyri note down—as seriously as they note any history, or any fact so well known and accepted as to need no 126  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS commentary—whole royal dynasties of Manes, to wit, of shadows and phantoms (astral bodies), and su c h feats of magic skill and such Occult phenomena, that the most credulous Occultist of our own times would hesitate to believe them to be true. The Orientalists have found a plank of salvation, while yet publishing and delivering the papyri to the criticism of literary Sadducees: they generally call them “romances of the days of Pharaoh So-and-So.” The idea is ingenious, if not absolutely fair. –––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME VII 1897 COMPILER’S NOTES [ These notes correspond to the respective superior numbers in the text of “ Eg yptian Magic ”.] 1 While at Thebes in February, 1855, A. C. Harris bought several remarkable papyri from some Arabs who c laimed to have found them all together in the same secret hiding place. One of them is a magnificent MS. which became known as the “Records of Ramses III”; another is a collection of several historical accounts from the reign of Ramses Neferka-Ra of the Twentieth Dynasty; a third is the Papyrus on Magic which H.P.B. speaks of. It consists of only nine pages containing 104 lines, to which are added 24 lines written on the reverse side. François Chabas published a work concerned with this papyrus, in which is given a facsimile of it together with complete translation and commentary on its meaning. The work is entitled Le Papyrus Magique Harris.

Dejussieu, 1860. vi, 250 pp., plates . 2 The original F rench text of this passage is as follows : «La magie de nos jours.— Sans recourir a ux cérémonies imposantes de la bague d’Hermès, ni aux obscures formules d’un mysticisme insondable, un magnétiseur de nos jours, au moyen de quelques gestes, bouleverse les facultés organiques, inculque la connaissance des langues étrangères, transporte dans les pays éloignés, dans les lieux secrets, fait deviner les pensées des absents, lire les lettres scellées, etc. L’antre des sybilles modernes est une simple chambre et le trépied de la pythonisse a fait place à un guéridon, à un chapeau, à une assiette, au meuble le plus vulgaire; mais, bien supérieur à l’oracle EGYPTIAN MAG I C   127 de l’antiquité qui se contentait de parler, l’oracle d’aujourd’hui va jusqu’à écrire ses réponses.

La crédulité humaine n’a pas aujourd’hui des bornes plus étroites qu’à l’aube des temps historiques, et il n’en sera pas autrement aussi longtemps que les hommes seront soumis aux mêmes infirmités et animés par les mêmes désirs, aussi longtemps que le cœur humain éprouvera l’influence de cet instinct qui nous porte à convoiter ardemment la richesse et la considération. Tel était le vœu de ce contemporain de Moise, dont les papyrus nous ont conté l’histoire: ’Ne pourrais-je trouver un moyen immédiat, irrésistible, pour devenir puissant et redouté?’ «De même que la tératologie est une partie essentielle de la physiologie générale, de même aussi les prétendues sciences occultes occupent dans les annales de l’humanité une place qui n’est pas sans importance et méritent à plus d’un titre l’attention du philosophe et de l’historien.» (pp."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"186-87.) 3 Quoted by de Mirville, either from de Rougé or the abbé Van Drival, in his Des Esprits, etc., Vol. V, p. 85.

Celui qui l’avait prononcé pendant la journée, voyait le trouble dans sa maison à tout jamais. . . . Au 5 de Pachons, défense de sortir de la maison, sous peine de tomber malade et de mourir.» (pp. 156-57.) Quoted by de Mirville, Des Esprits, etc., Vol. V, p. 88. 5 These abbreviated sentences are taken from a paragraph the French original of which is as follows: « Infl u ences généthliaques.— Indépendamment des observances dont ils avaient amené l’usage, les anniversaires mythologiques frappaient d’une marque heureuse ou fatale l’heure de la naissance; par exemple, l’enfant né le 21 de Thoth devait mourir dans la faveur . . . si c’était le 5 de Paophi, il serait tué par un taureau; le 27, par un serpent.

Quoted by be Mirville, op. cit ., Vol. V, p. 88. 6 The complete text of this incantation, as given by Chabas, is as follows: «‘O brebis, fil s de brebis; agneau, fils de brebis, qui te nourris du lait de la même brebis, ne permets pas que le défunt soit mordu par aucun serpent mâle ou femelle, par aucun scorpion, par aucun reptile; ne permets pas que le venin maîtrise ses membres; qu’il 128  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS ne soit pénétré par aucun mort, par aucune morte! que l’ombre d’aucun esprit ne le hante! que la bouche du serp e nt Am-kahou-ew n’ait pas de pouvoir sur lui! lui, il est la brebis . . . .’» (pp. 163-64.) Quoted by de Mirville, op. cit ., Vol. III, p. 65. 7 The French original of these sentences is as follows : « Faits acquis.— Nous appreno n s par cette singulière histoire que, pour les Égyptiens, les esprits possesseurs étaient des Khous, c’est-à-dire des êtres de l’espèce à laquelle appartenaient les humains après la mort.

Quoted by de Mirville, op. cit ., Vol. III, p. 66. 8 Chabas speaks in this connection of chapter 162 of the funeral Ritual, not of the Papyrus magique. He sa y s: «Nous avons du reste la preuve que des noms mystiques, assimilables à ceux des chapitres en question, étaient d’un usage vulgaire à l’époque du séjour des Hébreux en Égypte.» (p. 162.) Quoted by de Mirville, op. cit ., Vol. V, p. 89. 9 The original French text of this entire passage seems to convey a different meaning, in that the defunct is s poken of rather than the “astral spook.” It is as follows: «Osiris, siégeant sur son tribunal funéraire, y est invoqué sous le nom trois fois répété de Mamuram-Kahabu, et l’objet du chapitre est, comme c’est le cas pour la plupart de ceux du Rituel, d’obtenir que le défunt prenne toutes les formes qui lui plaisent et pénètre à son gré en tous lieux.» (p. 163.) Quoted by de Mirville, op. cit ., Vol. V, p. 89, where the same meaning is conveyed as in the original text of Chabas. 10 This passage is taken from what is known as the Papyrus Rollin, the third page of which is in the Bibliot h èque Nationale, Paris (C. 1188), while two earlier pages are in the collection of Dr. Lee at Hartwell ( vide Sharpe, Egypt.

The French text of the passage, as EGYPTIAN MAG I C   129 quoted by H.P.B., together with Chabas’ footnotes to some of the terms, is as follows: «De la premièr e page qui nous reste [Lee I], le commencement est mutilé.

The text of The Frogs contains no such passage. However, in the Introduction to the translation of The Frogs (in The Comedies of Aristophanes . Ed., transl. and Expl. by Benjamin Bickley Rogers. 6 vols. London: G. Bell & Sons, 1919. 2nd ed.), pp. xiv-xv, occurs the general idea expressed in the first part of this alleged passage; the closing part of it has remained untraced. 22 This may refer to Johannes Stobaeus’ Florilegium, in which Porphyry is quoted in connection with Stygios. In the ed. of Augustus Meineke, Lipsiae: B. G. Teubneri, 1855, these passages are in Vol. III, p. 248, and Vol. IV, p. 26. 23 The only passage somewhat resembling this general idea seems to be the one in Book I, 269, of Philo Judaeus’ De specialibus legibus, and is as follows: “The mind is cleansed by wisdom and the truths of wisdom’s teaching which guide its steps to the contemplation of the universe and all that is therein, and by the sacred company of the other virtues and by the practice of them shown in noble and highly praiseworthy actions.” 24 This passage is from a short essay of Michael Psellus entitled Peri Daimonôn ( De Daemonibus or Concerning Daimons according to the opinions of the Greeks ), section 5 thereof. The Latin text ( Vide Migne, Patrologiœ Cursus Completus. Ser. Gr., Vol. 122, col. 879. Paris, 1889) is as follows: “Magna autem Graecis videbatur multam vim habere. Eam ultimam medicinalis scientiae partem esse dicunt. Investigans enim omnium sublunarium substantiarum et naturam et qualitatem, elementorum nempe eorumque partium, animalium quorumlibet, plantarum eorumque fructuum, lapidum, herbarum, et una verbo omnium rerum substantiam et potentiam, inde sua operatur. Oblectamenta proponit sanitatem efficientia, speciesque diversissimas producit, et alia medicamenta morbum efficientia. Aquilae et dracones efficax illis erant ad sanitatem sumptis; feles autem et canes et corri vigiliae symbola. Cera vero et lutum in membrorum confictionem adhibibantur. Apparere etiam facit ignis coelestis editionem. Et sponte subrident statuae et subito igne totam pades acceduntur. Complectitur quoque totam astronomiam et multa per eam et potest et perficit.” In Isis Unveiled , I, 282-83 , H.P.B. refers the student to Thomas Taylor’s The Eleusinian and Bacchic Mysteries (3rd ed., New York: 134  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS J. W. Bouton, 1875), where other passages from this small essay of Psellus can be found in the Appendix, pp. 15 9 -65. 25 The statement concerning the “seven thousand Initiates” has reference to Livy’s History , Book XXXIX, xvii, 6, where, however, the author merely speaks of the fact that “in the conspiracy, it was said, more than seven thousand men and women were involved.” This refers to the wide-spread corruption resulting from a black magical form of Bacchanalia which had been imported from Etruria by a nameless Greek and which was undermining the morals of the people. Roman administrators put an end to it by drastic means. It is obvious from Livy’s own text that the term “initiate” cannot mean in this respect anything else but those who had joined this cult and took part in its orgies. This took place about 186 B.C. The second statement, concerning poisoning, has not been traced to its source.

It contains a most important pronouncement regarding the aims and objectives of The Theosophical Society, and the platform upon which it was founded. It also embodies an outspoken defence of Col. Henry S. Olcott, the President-Founder. The first page of the MS., containing, however, but a few lines of text (up to the middle of the second numbered item, at the word “races”), is missing. The missing lines have been restored from a typed copy at Adyar of an incomplete rendering of this pronouncement. Owing to the loss of the first page of the MS., the original title of it, if any, remains unknown. The present title is strongly suggested by the last paragraph of the text, and was adopted by C. Jinarâjadâsa, when he published this MS. for the second time in the pages of The Theosophist (Vol. LII, No. 11, August, 1931, pp. 561-589), where it had been originally published some years earlier (Vol. XLV, June, July, August and September, 1924). H.P.B.’s MS. represents her Reply to a Statement issued jointly by Arthur Gebhard and Mohini Mohun Chatterji under the title of “A Few Words on The Theosophical Organization,” and bearing the date of September 23, 1886. It embodied a rather harsh criticism of the Society and its President-Founder, Col. Henry S. Olcott. This joint Statement, in Mohini’s handwriting, exists also in the Adyar Archives. On the back of it, Col. Olcott has written: “Manifesto of Mohini and Arthur Gebhard about my despotism. H.P.B.’s cutting reply. 1886.” The sad circumstances underlying what H.P.B. called the Gebhard-Mohini “Manifesto,” and her own Reply, are perhaps nowhere expressed more graphically than in the two letters which follow: one to William Quan Judge, written on the very date when she signed her Reply, and the other to The Sinnetts, written but a few days later. LETTER FROM H.P.B. TO WILLIAM QUAN JUDGE The original of this letter was held in the official archives of the Theosophical Society with Headquarters at Point Loma, California.

I make him an offer of 400$ in three months installments—100$ each—or 300$ down. The secret is—does he care to have the Secret Doctrine or not—& whether he still wants to have Isis illustrated as he proposed to me in a letter. If he does—he will come down. If not, then there is little chance. But I feel sure you could manage it. You know that the copyright of Isis is mine—unless he has swindled me in this too. You ought to ascertain it. And if the copyright in Washington is in my name— then I suppose you could prevent him to sell even the remainder of the edition I do not know the laws & you do. But do try to come to some arrangement with him. If he gives me the 400 by installment—then I want you to have a $100 out of it—25$ each time; & if he gives only 350 down at once then let him send me a cheque for 275$—& give you another for $75. I don’t want you to take trouble & bother yourself for me for the Prussian King. But do try to settle something definite with the old devil, so as to close accounts for ever in the matter of Isis hitherto printed. And tell me whether you can copyright for me the S.D. and what I have to do for it. Take to him my letter & try to mesmerize him & wig on the right side . I tell you seriously the publisher who will have the S.D. will make lots even if I myself do little. But I must fence and guarantee myself, securely in this matter of copyrighting. And now to other things & far more serious. Arthur is with you now & you will find Arthur changed. One solitary month with Mohini has altered him so, that he is no more the same man. And the fruit of all this is—a manifesto written by Mohini & signed by both himself & Arthur. Anything more ungrateful, cold, unjust to poor Olcott and cruel I have never read Nor did I ever expect such a thing from Mohini, who, if he is now regarded as a Jesus on wheels & a Saint owes to Olcott’s advertisements of him & my enthusiastic claims for him. Now Mr. Mohini Babu (he passed 2 weeks with me) is cold, dignified & reserved with me, friendly and “patronizing” —but still never showing his little game right before my nose, but only behind my back. I will give you an example which will show his present drift. Poor old Dr Bergen who is as devoted as devotion itself to the Master’s ( ideal I call it with all those who ORIGINAL PRO G RAMME OF THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY 137 do not know Them personally)—& who went on purpose to London to hear of, & about Them, and went to see t he Arundales, heard to his amazement that the Masters were no longer regarded as the living actual Adepts, but either white Magicians with grayish tints, or “fictions” or something he could not make out. The Mahatmas he was told were unreachable Beings they could neither communicate, nor take concern in worldly or private affairs could never write letters or send messages —therefore our Masters could never be M AHATMAS . You see what the consequences o f all this have to be don’t you? Then when Bergen protested & said that he, at any rate, would never give up the living Masters; would always remain devoted to Them etc. Miss Arundale arose & looking him straight in the face, said: “ I thought once as you do ; it took me six months to come to Mohini’s views; BUT NOW I THINK AS HE DOES .” Plain this: Mohini is then exercising fo r over six months his influence over Miss Arundale to make her lose faith & belief even in the Masters. To me Mohini never said it so openly; but so many points more for him in wiliness & cunning. To me he said he was not of Bowaji ’ s way of thinking; that he blamed him"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"etc. and his policy seems to be identical. Both are determined, I see, to gradually destroy the Society.

Down then, with President, Head-Quarters, Society & all.” You will see it, because I answered it, & Sinnett will answer it too and we are going to print it to distribute among Fellows. Such was Mohini’s influence on Arthur that he who was all devotion when he arrived, now said to Sinnett in going away, “What matters it, so long you do good that you work within or outside the T.S. Why should there be any connection with it for us theosophists. Now keep this letter private and confidential don’t say anything to him but watch & see.

Ah, my poor dear Judge, do not be wiled away , for pity sake. Things will change & then everyone will be rewarded or— DAMNED . See if it don’t. Olcott is a con c eited ass, but there is no one more faithful & true than he is to the Masters & the original ideal & no one is more devoted to the Society planned & established under Their Orders—than he is.

My Dear Mr. and Mrs. Sinnett, I forward Mohini’s Manifesto which you please read carefully, if you have not before. I trust it to your care for a few days begging you to send it back to me intact, as I have to send it to Olcott and Council. It cannot and will not remain unnoticed. He addresses it “to all theosophists interested in the progress of true theosophy” and it will be circulated all over America whether printed or not. It cannot be left unanswered. If you have changed your mind and will not answer it—as you wanted to—then I must send it to Adyar where it will be made use of, and my Reply the same. So as your idea of recasting it is good and you may read it in a new form to your Society or"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"do with it whatever you like—I must beg you to send it me (my MSS) intact also, and as it is; for I have neither time nor desire to copy it and am ordered to forward both the Manifesto and my Reply to Adyar and thence to America. Of course you can do as you like. Only there are two ways left open before us, now, that Mohini has pronounced himself: either an amicable separation into groups, each according to its harmonious spirit, or—a thundering separation and a collapse ORIGINAL PRO G RAMME OF THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY 139 of the “L.L. of T.S.” The first may be effected by you, and quietly after you have talked it over with Mohini an d Miss A.; the other will burst upon you as a thunder-clap, for they are preparing for it. The minds of our best members are poisoned by insinuations and metaphysical and cosmistical assumptions. Even Bm. Keightley has sailed off on the Yogi line. Neither Astrology nor Mesmerism will save it. What those fanatics want is the dark spirit of fanaticism, engrossed in which, they have lost sight of the fact that Mohini has quietly withdrawn from under their noses their living Teachers and ideals and substituted for them himself— instead. I do not care for it personally. The days of heart-aching, and struggle and fight are over for me personally. I have done my duty, as ordered, and prefer remaining with Mohini on diplomatic friendly terms (an armed peace like the rest of Europe), than in open war. Much of what he says is true, that [but?] unless people are MADE to see the revers de la médaille of his “Saintship”—and his black ingratitude and cold-heartedness to Olcott and all—the L.L. will be lost in a fog of Maya created by the young gentleman. He has psychologised them all and all see as he wants them to. You remain indifferent? Very well; so am I. Mrs. K. and Maitland both tell me that the only means of saving the L.L. is to break it into groups or— best of all for me to come to London and proclaim myself President of a group of Occultists!! They take me for a Battenberg, or a Stambuloff of Bulgaria—verily. Well, it remains for me to wash my hands of the whole matter and ask you again to send me back both MSS—whether you recast mine or not. L’un n’empêche pas l’autre.

Olcott sometime in the latter part of December, 1886 (published in The Theosophist, August, 1931, pp. 684-85), just prior to a business trip which Countess Constance Wachtmeister was going to make to London. This trip took place just prior to the New Year of 1887, and into the first days of January. Up to that time, both Documents were still in H.P.B.’s hands.

Jinarâjadâsa in a booklet-form reprint of “The Original Prog r amme” and the “Preliminary Memorandum of the Esoteric Section,” pp. 51-59 (Adyar: Theos. Publ. House, 1931). Reprinted by permission of the Publishers.] As an act of Theosophical duty the following observations on some features of the present organization of the Theosophical Society are submitted to those interested in the progress of true Theosophy. In the “Rules of the Theosophical Society together with an explanation of its objects and principles” for 1885 (the last published) it appears that “The whole Society is under the special care of one General Council, and of the President, its Founder. The members of the General Council shall annually be elected by the Convention and their duties shall consist in advising the President-Founder in regard to all matters referred to them by him.” On pp. 2 et seq. is to be found the list of additional members of the Council, which with some variations has continued for years. This list gives the names of those about whom alone there can be any elective rights exercised by the Convention, the rest being members ex officio. If the election is at all like what is known in the world outside the Theosophical Society the gentlemen appearing in the list ought at all events to be known to the Convention for some acts in pursuance of the “special care” of the Society vested in them by the Rules. But notoriously that is not the case. Practically they are all appointed by the President-Founder. The power of the General Council extends to “advising the President-Founder in regard to all matters referred ORIGINAL PRO G RAMME OF THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY  141 to them by him.” But in the meantime the President-Founder is empowered to issue special orders and provision a l rules “in the name and behalf of the General Council” (Rule iv, p. 20). Thus the President-Founder is empowered to pledge the name and credit of the General Council, which enjoys the right “of advising the President-Founder” in the terms of the Rule quoted above. It only remains to add that five, and in emergent cases three, members constitute a quorum of the General Council meetings and that there are over a hundred and fifty members on the Council. There is no such institution in existence as the Parent Society which by the Rules is competent to issue and nullify charters without which “no Branch can be formed or continued.” If however the Parent Society has any existence its constitution is as mysterious as that of the Venetian Council of Three. The centre of power in the Society is thus vested in [a] President who is further armed with the authority of this mysterious body.* The Convention mentioned before and described in Rule ix (p. 20) is in no sense a representative or legal body, being nothing more than the gathering of those among the members who pay a visit to Adyar during the Christmas holidays. These gatherings have a value of their"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"own in contributing to mutual instruction of members. But this value is certainly not increased by grossly misconceiving its character. There is no possibility of any gathering of members of the Theosophical Society binding the whole Society by its resolutions. For a member does not give any undertaking beyond what is implied in his application.† From the standpoint of Universal Brotherhood, however, such action would never be contemplated by any meeting calling itself Theosophical. In illustration it may be mentioned that the London Lodge of the Theosophical Society has completely ignored the rules published by the Head-Quarters at Adyar. Thus it is plain that the Theosophical Society has laws without sanction, a legislative body without legality, a Parent Society without existence and a President-Founder above all rules. How far this is consistent with Theosophy and Brotherhood requires serious consideration. It is also noteworthy that the system of centralization of –––––––––– * Without a word of explanation the Parent Society has disappeared from the “Rules” dated 1886. † The form o f application given in the “Rules” (1885) requires only acquaintance with the rules, while that dated 1886 declares willingness to conform thereto. But neither would validate Rules passed ultra vires as by the Convention. The change in the latest Rules is perhaps intended to remedy this illegal proceeding on the part of the Convention. ––––––––––– 142  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS power discussed above is in contravention of rule II (p. 19) which expects members “to govern themselves in t heir mutual relations according to that principle” ( i.e ., of Universal Brotherhood).* The matter is placed in a more striking light by the declaration in rule XIV (p. 24) † that the Society has “to deal only with scientific and philosophical subjects.” Hence it is quite evident that the power and position claimed in the “Rules” for the President-Founder, the General Council, and the Convention are opposed to the spirit of the declared objects of the Society. There is no raison d’être for any controlling authority. The different Theosophic groups can but ( a ) preach and practise Universal Brotherhood, ( b ) study ancient religion and philosophy, or ( c ) investigate psychical phenomena. Now, with regard to these matters Theosophy teaches self-culture and not control. The Society rests upon the declaration of sympathy with its objects, which every member makes before admission. As a Brotherhood it must aspire to bring about the state in which the sense of duty is the only incentive to action. Those amongst us who realize it most can and will but recommend greater simplicity of organization and not the reverse. The Parent Society ‡ being what is described above, no charter to Branches can be issued. Nor is it necessary to do so. The same holds good of diplomas to members on admission without any test of merit. The admission fee paid by members to the office at Adyar is of the nature of taxation and therefore inconsistent with the principle of Brotherhood. Nor does it appear that the Theosophical Society ought to be in need of money. The expenses for the maintenance of a central office at Adyar for keeping records and concentrating information cannot be more than would be met by voluntary contributions. Those for the annual gathering would always be paid by such members as perceive its benefit. A forced gift is unbrotherly; and moreover if the Society and its work are so little appreciated that a closer acquaintance with them will dissuade members from helping them with money to the amount"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"now paid, then it can only be that those who join the Society do so only through misconceptions, and in that case it is better that the Society should cease to exist than that it should be the recipient of gifts which might produce subsequent regret in the donors. For the Theosophical Society to insist upon the fee of £ I before accepting as a brother one who asks for that recognition is the sale of Brotherhood. It is –––––––––– * This rule is not specifically mentioned in the “Rules” (1886) but is clearly implied. † Rule 25, p. 19 (1 8 86). ‡ The argument is not affected by the substitution of the Parent Society by a Council of Seven. –––––––––– ORIGINAL PRO GRAMME OF THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY 143 worse than useless to keep up a Society, call it Theosophical, and yet show no faith in Theosophy and the princi p le of Brotherhood. The above was written under the misapprehension that the “Rules” bearing date 1885 were the latest. It has since been found that there is a later version of the rules dated 1886, which have modified the older rules on a great many points. But it is necessary to examine the earlier rules to ascertain the underlying principle which runs through the present ones as well. The chief point is that the Convention has no power to make any rules, as such a power is opposed to the spirit of Theosophy and also because the Convention itself is devoid of legal existence. Is there anything in the declared objects of the Society which allows of the existence of the Convention? Further, the Executive Council constituted or supposed to be so, by the Convention can have no power exceeding that of the Convention. But this it has by rule 14, clause ( c ), p. 17 of the “Rules” (1886), which limits the power of the Convention to the disposal of “all questions of importance laid before it by the President and Executive Council .” It has no power of effectually checking either. The whole question turns upon this—Is the Theosophical Society a Brotherhood or not? If the former, is it possible to have any centre of arbitrary power? To hold that there is a necessity for such a centre is only a roundabout way of saying that no Brotherhood is possible, but in point of fact that necessity itself is by no means proved. There have been no doubt Brotherhoods under single Masters, but in such cases the Masters were never elected for geographical or other considerations. The natural leader of men was always recognized by his embodying the spirit of Humanity. To institute comparisons would be little short of blasphemy. The greatest amongst men is always the readiest to serve and yet is unconscious of the Service . L e t u s p a u s e b efore finally tying the millstone of worldliness round the neck of Theosophy. Let us not forget that Theosophy does not grow in our midst by force and control, but by the sunshine of brotherliness and the dew of self-oblivion. If we do not believe in Brotherhood and Truth, let us put ashes on our head and weep in sackcloth and not rejoice in the purple of authority and in the festive garments of pride and worldliness. Better it is by far that the name of Theosophy should never be heard than that it should be used as the motto of a papal institution. The fact must be recognized that the highest authority in the Society is to be found exactly where there is the untheosophic demand for authority. By rule 12, p. 17 (1886) “no Bye-laws and Rules of Branches shall be valid unless ratified by the President in Council.” What is the meaning of this power? Is it to be understood that the Executive Council sitting at Adyar knows better than the local members what is needed by a distant Branch, never perhaps visited by a single member of the Council?"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 144  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS More words are useless. Enough has been said to show that the organization called Theosophical p resents many features seriously obstructive to the progress of Theosophy, and that unless the danger is perceived in time we shall not know what answer to make when the day of reckoning comes. It would be out of place to suggest any specific measures. For no one who has any faith in Brotherhood and in the power of Truth will fail to perceive what is necessary. While on the other hand if the foregoing words are but a cry in the wilderness, not evoking any definite perception of duty in members of the Theosophical Society, no Theosophic measures can be suggested for the reform of that which is not Theosophical. There is another reason which determines the present course. The tyranny of majorities over minorities is opposed to the principle of Brotherhood. Truth does not depend on show of hands. It only remains to express fraternal wishes that every one of our brothers may feel the full sense of the responsibility which he has undertaken in the name of Truth and Brotherhood. It behooves us to bear in mind—Theosophy first and organization after. M OHINI M. C HATTERJI , F. T. S., for self and A. G EB H ARD , F. T.

That the Convention has practically no authority is evident from the following considerations. By rule 21, clause ( d ), p. 19 (1886)* it is laid down that “an annual subscription of two shillings shall always be paid in advance by all the active Fellows of the Society”. It is well known that not only individuals but even Branches have refused to pay this subscription. The refusals have been acquiesced in, to all appearances, without any reference to the Convention. Comments are not necessary to show what bearing this has upon Theosophy and the Organization. Is it better to make demands which are abandoned on resistance being offered, or to leave such contributions to the Theosophical feelings of the members? The question for consideration is not whether the Theosophical Society is doing good, but whether it is d o ing that kind of good which is entitled to the name of Theosophy.

Universal Brotherhood; 2. No distinction to be made by the member between races, creeds, or social positions, but every member had to be judged and dealt by on his personal merits; 3. To study the philosophies of the East—those of India chiefly, presenting them gradually to the public in various works that would interpret exoteric religions in the light of esoteric teachings; 4. To oppose materialism and theological dogmatism in every possible way, by demonstrating the existence of 146  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS occult forces unknown to science, in nature, and the presence of psychic and spiritual powers in man; t rying, at the same time to enlarge the views of the Spiritualists by showing them that there are other, many other agencies at work in the production of phenomena besides the “Spirits” of the dead. Superstition had to be exposed and avoided; and occult forces, beneficent and maleficent ––ever surrounding us and manifesting their presence in various ways—demonstrated to the best of our ability. Such was the programme in its broad features. The two chief Founders were not told what they had to do, how they had to bring about and quicken the growth of the Society and results desired; nor had they any definite ideas given them concerning its outward organization—all this being left entirely with themselves. Thus, as the undersigned had no"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"capacity for such work as the mechanical formation and administration of a Society, the management of the latter was left in the hands of Col. H. S. Olcott, then and there elected by the primitive founders and members— President for life. But if the two Founders were not told what they had to do, they were distinctly instructed about what they should never do , what they had to avoid, and what the Society should never become. Church organizations, Christian and Spiritual sects were shown as the future contrasts to our Society.* To make it clearer:— ––––––––––– * A liberal Chr is tian member of the T.S. having objected to the study of Oriental religions and doubted whether there was room left for any new Society—a letter answering his objections and preference to Christianity was received and the contents copied for him; after which he denied no longer the advisability of such a Society as the proposed Theosophical Association. A few extracts from this early letter will show plainly the nature of the Society as then contemplated, and that we have tried only to follow, and carry out in the best way we could the intentions of the true originators of the Society in those days.

If it were so indeed, then your religion would have introduced the highest truths into all the social, civil and international relations of Christendom. Instead of that as anyone can perceive, your social as your private life is not based upon a common moral solidarity but only on constant mutual counteraction and purely mechanical equilibrium of individual powers and interests . . . . If you would be a theosophist you must not do as those around you do who call on a God of Truth and Love and serve the dark Powers of Might, Greed and Luck. We look in the midst of your Christian civilization and see the same sad signs of old: the realities of your daily lives are diametrically opposed to your religious ideal, but you feel it not; the thought that the very laws that govern your being whether in the domain of politics or social economy clash painfully with the origins of your religion—do not seem to trouble you in the least. But if the nations of the West are so fully convinced that the ideal can never become practical and the practical will never reach the ideal—then, you have to make your choice: either it is your religion that is impracticable, and in that case it is no better than a vain-glorious delusion, or it might find a practical application, but it is you yourselves, who do not care to apply its ethics to your daily walk in life . . .

The “fee” was re-established, before the Founders left for India with the two English delegates—now their mortal enemies; but the money collected was for the Arya Samaj of Aryavarta with which Society the Theosophical became affiliated. It is the Prest.-Founder, who paid the enormous travelling expenses from America to India, and those of installation in Bombay, and who supported the two delegates out of his own pocket for nearly 18 months. When he had no more money left, nor the Corresponding Secretary either—a resolution was passed that the “initiation fee” sums should go towards supporting the Head Quarters. Owing to the rapid increase in the Society in India, the present Rules and Statutes grew out. They are not the outcome of the deliberate thought and whim of the Prest.-Founder, but the result of the yearly meetings of the General Council at the Anniversaries. If the members of that G. C. have framed them so as to give a wider authority to the President-Founder, it was the result of their absolute confidence in him, in his devotion and love for the Society, and not at all—as implied in “A Few Words”—a proof of his love for power and authority.

But, if it can be shown that the President has done what he could under the circumstance s and in the best way he knew how—no one, least of all a theosophist, can charge him with the sins of the whole community as now done. From the founders down to the humblest member the Society is composed of imperfect mortal men—not gods. This was always claimed by its leaders. “He who feels without sin , let him cast the first stone.” It is the duty of every Member of the Council to offer advice and to bring for the consideration of the whole body any incorrect proceedings One of the plaintiffs is a Councillor.

This Rule XIIth was one of the first and the wisest.

The results of this too just complaint are, that those for whom he toiled, are the first to fling at h im the reproach of being ignorant of certain Hindu terms, of using one term for another, for instance of having applied the word “Jivanmukta” to a Hindu chela, on one occasion! The crime is a terrible one, indeed . . . We know of “ chelas ,” who being Hindus, are sure never to confuse such well known terms in their religion; but who, on the other hand, pursue Jivanmuktship and the highest theosophical Ethics through the royal road of selfish ambition, lies, slander, ingratitude and backbiting. Every road leads to Rome; this is evident; and there is such a thing in Nature as “ Mahatma ”- Dugpas . . . It would be desirable for the cause of theosophy and truth, however, were all the critics of our President in general, less learned, yet found reaching more to the level of his all-forgiving good nature, his thorough sincerity and unselfishness; as the rest of the members less inclined to lend a willing ear to those, who, like the said “Vicars of Bray” have developed a hatred for the Founders—for reasons unknown. The above advice is offered to the two Theosophists who have just framed their “Few Words on the Theosophical Organization.” That they are not alone in their complaints (which, translated from their diplomatic into plain language look a good deal in the present case like a mere “ querelle d ’ allemand ”) and that the said complaints are in a great measure just,—is frankly admitted. Hence, the writer must be permitted to speak in this, her answer, of theosophy and theosophists in general, instead of limiting the Reply strictly to the complaints uttered. There is not the slightest desire to be personal; yet, there has accumulated of late such a mass of incandescent material in the Society, by that eternal friction of precisely such “selfish personalities,” that it is certainly wise to try to smother the sparks in time, by pointing out to their true nature. Demands, and a feeling of necessity for reforms have not originated with the two complainants. They date 152  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS from several years, and there has never been a question of avoiding reforms, but rather a failure of findi n g such means as would satisfy all the theosophists. To the present day, we have yet to find that “wise man” from the East or from the West, who could not only diagnosticate the disease in the Theosophical Society, but offer advice and a remedy likewise to cure it. It is easy to write: “It would be out of place to suggest any specific"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"measures [for such reforms, which do seem more difficult to suggest than to be vaguely hinted at]. For no one who has any faith in Brotherhood and in the power of Truth will fail to perceive what is necessary,”—concludes the critic. One may, perhaps, have such faith and yet fail to perceive what is most necessary. Two heads are better than one; and if any practical reforms have suggested themselves to our severe judges their refusal to give us the benefit of their discovery would be most unbrotherly. So far, however, we have received only most impracticable suggestions for reforms whenever these came to be specified. The Founders, and the whole Central Society at the Headquarters, for instance, are invited to demonstrate their theosophical natures by living like “fowls in the air and lilies of the field,” which neither sow nor reap, toil not, nor spin and “take no thought for the morrow.” This being found hardly practicable, even in India, where a man may go about in the garment of an Angel, but has, nevertheless, to pay rent and taxes, another proposition, then a third one and a fourth—each less practicable than the preceding—were offered . . . the unavoidable rejection of which led finally to the criticism now under review. After carefully reading “A Few Words, etc.,” no very acute intellect is needed to perceive that, although no “specific measures” are offered in them, the drift of the whole argument tends but to one conclusion, a kind of syllogism more Hindu than metaphysical. Epitomised, the remarks therein plainly say: “Destroy the bad results pointed out by destroying the causes that generate them.” Such is the apocalyptic meaning of the paper, although “ORIGINAL PR O GRAMME” MANUSCRIPT  153 both causes and results are made painfully and flagrantly objective and that they may be rendered in th i s wise: Being shown that the Society is the result and fruition of a bad President; and the latter being the outcome of such an “untheosophically” organized Society—and, its worse than useless General Council—“make away with all these Causes and the results will disappear”; i.e., the Society will have ceased to exist. Is this the heart-desire of the two true and sincere Theosophists ? The complaints—“submitted to those interested in the progress of true Theosophy”—which seems to mean “theosophy divorced from the Society ” — may now be noticed in order and answered. They specify the following objections:— (I) To the language of the Rules with regard to the powers invested in the President-Founder by the General Council. This objection seems very right. The sentence . . . The duties of the Council “shall consist in advising the P.F. in regard to all matters referred to them by him ” may be easily construed as implying that on all matters not referred to the Council by the Pres.-Founder . . . its members will hold their tongues. The Rules are changed, at any rate they are corrected and altered yearly. This sentence can be taken out. The harm, so far, is not so terrible."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"(II) It is shown that many members ex-officio whose names are found on the list of the General Council are not known to the Convention; that they are, very likely, not even interested in the Society “under their special care”; a body they had joined at one time, then probably forgotten its existence in the meanwhile, to withdraw themselves from the Association. The argument implied is very valid. Why not point it out officially to the Members residing at, or visiting the Head-Quarters, the impropriety of such a parading of names? Yet, in what respect can this administrative blunder, or 154  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS carelessness, interfere with, or impede “the p r ogress of true theosophy”?* (III) “The members are appointed by the President-Founder . . . it is complained; the General Council only advises on what is submitted to it”. . . and “in the meantime that P.F. is empowered to issue special orders and provisional rules,” on behalf of that (“dummy”) Council. (Rule IV, p. 20.) Moreover, it is urged that out of a number of 150 members of the G. Council, a quorum of 5 and even 3 members present, may, should it be found necessary by the President, decide upon any question of vital importance, etc., etc., etc. Such an “untheosophical” display of authority, is objected to by Messrs. M. M. Chatterji and A. Gebhard, on the grounds that it leads the Society to Caesarism, to “tyranny” and papal infallibility, etc., etc. However right the two complainants may be in principle it is impossible to fail seeing, the absurd exaggerations of the epithets used; for, having just been accused on one page of “tyrannical authority,” of “centralization of power” and a “papal institution” (p. 9)—on page 11, the President-Founder is shown “issuing special orders ” from that “centre of Caesarism”— which no one is bound to obey, unless he so wishes ! “It is well known” remarks the principal writer—“that not only individuals but even Branches have refused to pay this [annual] subscription . . . of . . . two shillings” (p. 11); without any bad effect for themselves, resulting out of it, as appears. Thus it would seem it is not to a non-existent authority that objections should be made, but simply to a vain and useless display of power that no one cares for. The policy of issuing “special orders” with such sorry results is indeed objectionable; only, not on the ground of a tendency to Caesarism, but simply because it becomes highly ridiculous.

It is admitted with regret that the world of scoffers and non -theosophists might, if they heard of it, find in it a capital matter for fun. But the real wonder is, how can certain European theosophists, who have bravely defied the world to make them wince under any amount of ridicule, once they acted in accordance with the dictates of their conscience and duty—make a crime of what is at the worst a harmless, even if ridiculous, bit of vanity; a desire of giving importance—not to the Founder, but to his Society for which he is ready to die any day. One kind of ridicule is worth another. The Western theosophist, who for certain magnetic reasons wears his hair long and shows otherwise eccentricity in his dress, will be spared no more than his President, with his “special orders.” Only the latter, remaining as kindly disposed and brotherly to the “individual theosophist and even a Branch”— that snub him and his “order,” by refusing to pay what others do—shows himself ten-fold more theosophical and true to the principle of Brotherhood, than the former, who traduces and denounces him in such uncharitable terms, instead of kindly warning him of the bad effect produced. Unfortunately, it is not those who speak the loudest of virtue and theosophy, who are the best exemplars of both. Few of them, if any, have tried to cast out the beam from their own eye, before they raised their voices against the mote in the eye of a brother. Furthermore, it seems to have become quite the theosophical rage in these days, to denounce vehemently, yet never to offer to help pulling out any such motes. The Society is bitterly criticized for asking every well-to-do theosophist (the poor are exempt from it, from the first) to pay annually two shillings to help defraying the expenses at Head-Quarters. It is denounced as “untheosophical,” “unbrotherly,” and the “admission fee” of £1, is declared no better than a “sale of Brotherhood.” In this our “Brotherhood” may be shown again on a far higher level than any other association past or present. 156  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS The Theosophical Society has never shown the ambitious pretension to outshine in theosophy an d brotherliness, the primitive Brotherhood of Jesus and his Apostles,* and that “Organization,” besides asking and being occasionally refused, helped itself without asking, and as a matter of fact in a real community of Brothers. Nevertheless, such action, that would seem highly untheosophical and prejudicial in our day of culture when nations alone are privileged to pocket each other’s property and expect to be honoured for it—does not seem to have been an obstacle in the way of deification and sanctification of the said early “Brotherly” group. Our Society had never certainly any idea of rising superior to the brotherliness and ethics preached by Christ, but only to those of the sham Christianity of the Churches—as originally ordered to, by our M ASTERS . And if we do not worse than the Gospel Brothe r hood did, and far better than any Church, which would expel any member refusing too long to pay his Church rates, it is really hard to see why our “Organization” should be ostracized by its own members.

But the Parent-body does exist, and will, so long as the last man or woman of the primitive group of Theosophists- Founders is alive. This—as a body; as for its moral characteristics, the Parent-Society means that small nucleus of theosophists who hold sacredly through storm and blows to the original programme of the T.S. as established under the direction and orders of those, whom they recognize—and will, to their last breath––as the real originators of the Movement, their living, Holy M ASTERS AND T EACHERS.* (V) The complaints then, that the T.S. “has laws without sanction, a legislative body without legal i ty, a Parent Society without existence,” and, worse than all—“a President-Founder above all rules ” — are thus shown only partially correct. But even were they all absolutely true, it would be easy to abolish such rules with one stroke of the pen, or to modify them. But now comes the curious part of that severe philippic against the T.S. by our eloquent Demosthenes. After six pages (out of the twelve) had been filled with the said charges, the writer admits on the 7th,—that they have been so modified!—“The above” we learn (rather late) “was written under the misapprehension that the Rules bearing date 1885 were the latest.

This is no place for an etymological disquisition and the fitness or unfitness of the qualification, in the case in hand. As a state, Mahatmaship is one thing, as a double noun, Maha-atma (Great Soul), quite another one.

But the accusers do not see it in this light. They are determined to act as a theosophical Nemesis; and in no way daunted by the discovery, they add that nevertheless “it is necessary to examine the earlier rules to ascertain the underlying principle which runs through the present ones as well.” This reminds of the fable of “the Wolf and the Lamb.” But—you see—“the chief point is that the Convention has no power to make any rules, as such a power is opposed to the spirit of Theosophy . . . . ,” etc., etc. Now this is the most extraordinary argument that could be made. At this rate no Brotherhood, no Association, no Society is possible. More than this: no theosophist, however holy his present life may be, would have the right to call himself one; for were it always found necessary to examine his earlier life , “to ascertain the underlying principle ” which rules through the nature of the present man—ten to one, he would be found unfit to be called a theosophist! The experiment would hardly be found pleasant to the majority of those whom association with the T.S. has reformed, and of such there are a good many. After such virulent and severe denunciations one might expect some good, friendly and theosophically practical advice. Not at all, and none is offered, since we have been already told (p. 9) that it would be “out of place to suggest any specific measures. For no one who has any faith in Brotherhood and in the power of Truth will fail to perceive what is necessary.” The President-Founder, has no faith in either “Brotherhood,” or “the power of Truth”—apparently. This is made evident by his having failed to perceive (a) that the Head-Quarters —opened to all Theosophists of any race or social position, board and lodging free of charge the whole year round—was an unbrotherly Organization; (b) that the “central office at Adyar for keeping records and concentrating information” with its European and Hindu inmates “ORIGINAL PR O GRAMME” MANUSCRIPT  159 working gratuitously and some helping it with their own money whenever they have it—ought to be c arried on, according to the method and principle of George Muller of Bristol, namely, the numerous household and staff of officers at Adyar headed by the Prest.-Founder ought to kneel every morning in prayer for their bread and milk appealing for their meals to “miracle”; and that finally, and (c) all the good the Society is doing, is no good whatever but “a spiritual wrong,” because it presumes to call a “ limited line of good work [theosophy] Divine Wisdom.”"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The undersigned is an ever patient theosophist, who has hitherto laboured under the impression that no amount of subtle scholasticism and tortured casuistry but could find like the Rosetta stone its Champollion—some day.

What can indeed be made out of the following jumble of contradictory statements:— (a) The Prest.-Founder having been shown throughout as a “tyrant,” a “ would be Caesar,” “aiming at papal power” and a “Venetian Council of Three,” and other words to that effect implied in almost every sentence of the paper under review, it is confessed in the same breath “that the London Lodge of the Theosophical Society has completely ignored the Rules [of the Pope Caesar] published by the Headquarters at Adyar”!

Is it not self-evident, that the words brought forward “only with scientific and philosophical subjects” are inserted as a necessary caution to true theosophists, who by dealing with politics within any Branch Society might bring disgrace and ruin on the whole body,—in India to begin with? Has the Society or has it not over 140 Societies scattered through four parts of the World to take care of? As in the case of “Mahatmas” and the “Mahatmaship”—active work of the Theosophical Society is confused—willingly or otherwise it is not for the writer to decide—with Theosophy. No need of entering here upon the difference between the jar that contains a liquid and the nature of, or that liquid itself. “Theosophy teaches self-culture and not control,” we are told. Theosophy teaches mutual-culture before self -culture to begin with. Union is strength. It is by gathering many theosophists of the same way of thinking into one or more groups, and making them closely united by the same magnetic bond of fraternal unity and sympathy that the objects of mutual development and progress in Theosophical thought may be best achieved. “Self-culture” is for isolated Hatha Yogis , independent of any Society and having to avoid association with human beings; and this is a triply distilled S ELFISHNESS.

Why spend such sums of money and pay so many officers to watch over its treasures, the more so, since many of its guardians may be quite out of keeping with, and opposed to the Spirit of that Wisdom? The Directors of such Museums may or may not be very perfect men, and some of their assistants may have never opened a philosophical work: yet, it is they who take care of the library and preserving it for future generations are indirectly entitled to their thanks. How much more gratitude is due to those who like our self-sacrificing theosophists at Adyar, devote their lives to, and give their services gratuitously to the good of Humanity! Diplomas, and Charters are objected to, and chiefly the “admission fee.” The latter is a “taxation,” and therefore “ inconsistent with the principle of Brotherhood” . . . A “ forced gift is unbrotherly ,” etc., etc. It would be curious to see where the T.S. would be led to, were the Pt.-F. to religiously follow the proffered advices. “Initiation” on admission, has been made away with already in Europe, and has led to that which will very soon become known: no use mentioning it at present. Now the “Charters” and diplomas would follow. Hence no document to show for any group, and no diploma to prove that one is affiliated to the Society. Hence also perfect liberty to any one to either call himself a theosophist, or deny he is one. The “admission fee”? Indeed, it has to be regarded as a terrible and unbrotherly “extortion,” and a “forced gift,” in the face of those thousands of Masonic Lodges, of Clubs, Associations, Societies, Leagues, and even the “Salvation Army.” The former, 162  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS extort yearly fortunes from their Members; the latter—throttle in the name of Jesus the masses and app e aling to voluntary contributions make the converts pay, and pay in their turn every one of their “officers,” none of whom will serve the “Army” for nothing.

Or are we to understand that all correspondence with members—now left to “ self-culture ”—is also to cease and has to follow diplomas, Charters and the rest? Then truly, the Head-Quarters and Office have better be closed. A simple Query— however: Have the £1.—the yearly contribution to the L.L. of the T.S., and the further sum of 2/6d. to the Oriental Group been abolished as “ acts of unbrotherly extortion,” and how long, if so, have they begun to be regarded as “a sale of Brotherhood”? To continue: the charges wind up with the following remarks, so profound, that it requires a deeper head than ours to fathom all that underlies the words contained in them. “Is the Theosophical Society a Brotherhood, or not?” queries the plaintiff—“if the former, is it possible to have any centre of arbitrary power ? * To hold that there is a necessity for such a centre is only a round-about way of saying that no Brotherhood is possible,† but in point of fact that necessity itself is by no means proved [!?]. There –––––––––– * I t is th e fir s t tim e since the T.S. exists that such an accusation of arbitrary power, is brought forward. Not many will be found of this way of thinking. † No need taking a roundabout way, to say that no Brotherhood would ever be possible if many theosophists shared the very original views of the writer. –––––––––– “ORIGINAL PROGRAMME” MANUSCRIPT  163 have been no doubt Brotherhoods under single Masters [there “have been” and still are . H. P. B.], but in suc h cases the Masters were never elected for geographical or other considerations [?]. The natural leader of men was always recognized by his embodying the spirit of Humanity. To institute comparisons would be little short of blasphemy. The greatest among men is always the readiest to serve and yet is unconscious of the Service. “Let us pause before finally tying the millstone of worldliness round the neck of Theosophy. Let us not forget that Theosophy does not grow in our midst by force and control, but by the sunshine of brotherliness and the dew of self-oblivion. If we do not believe in Brotherhood and Truth, let us put ashes on our head and weep in sackcloth and not rejoice in the purple of authority and in the festive garments of pride and worldliness. Better it is by far that the name of Theosophy should never be heard than that it should be used as the motto of a papal institution. ” Who, upon reading this, and being ignorant that the above piece of rhetorical flowers of speech is directed against the luckless Prest.-Founder—would not have in his “mind’s eye”—an Alexander Borgia, a Caligula, or to say the least—General Booth in his latest metamorphosis!

This virulent sortie is no doubt due to “ SELF-CULTURE ”? The critic has outgrown the movement and turned his f ace from the original programme; hence his severity. But where is the true theosophical charity, the tolerance and the “ sunshine of brotherliness ” just spoken of, and so insisted upon? Verily—it is easy to preach the “dew of self-oblivion” when one has nothing to think about except to evolve such finely rounded phrases; were every theosophist at Adyar to have his daily wants and even 164  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS comforts, his board, lodging and all, attended to by a wealthier theosophist; and were the same “sunshin e of brotherliness” to be poured upon him, as it is upon the critic who found for himself an endless brotherly care, a fraternal and self-sacrificing devotion in two other noble minded members, then—would there be little need for the President-Founder to call upon and humble himself before our theosophists. For, if he has to beg for 2 annual shillings—it is, in order that those—Europeans and Hindus—who work night and day at Adyar, giving their services free and receiving little thanks or honour for it should have at least one meal a day. The fresh “dew of self -oblivion” must not be permitted to chill one’s heart, and turn into the lethal mold of forgetfulness to such an extent as that. The severe critic seems to have lost sight of the fact that for months, during the last crisis, the whole staff of our devoted Adyar officers, from the President down to the youngest brother in the office, have lived on 5d. a day each, having reduced their meals to the minimum. And it is this mite, the proceeds of the “2 shill. contribution,” conscientiously paid by some that is now called extortion , a desire to live “in the purple of authority and in the festive garments of pride and worldliness”! Our “Brother” is right. Let us “weep in sackcloth and ashes on our head” if the T.S. has many more such unbrotherly criticisms to bear. Truly it would be far better “that the name of Theosophy should never be heard than that it should be used as the motto”—not of papal authority which exists nowhere at Adyar outside the critic’s imagination—but as a motto of a “self-developed fanaticism.” All the great services otherwise rendered to the Society, all the noble work done by the complainant will pale and vanish before such an appearance of cold-heartedness. Surely he cannot desire the annihilation of the Society? And if he did it would be useless: the T.S. cannot be destroyed as a body. It is not in the power of either Founders or their critics; and neither friend nor enemy can ruin that which is doomed to exist, all the blunders of “ORIGINAL PR O GRAMME” MANUSCRIPT  165 "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"its leaders notwithstanding. That which was generated through and founded by the “High Masters” and under their authority if not their instruction— MUST AND WILL LIVE . Each of us and all will r eceive his or her Karma in it, but the vehicle of Theosophy will stand indestructible and undestroyed by the hand of whether man or fiend. No; “truth does not depend on show of hands”; but in the case of the much-abused President-Founder it must depend on the show of facts. Thorny and full of pitfalls was the steep path he had to climb up alone and unaided for the first years. Terrible was the opposition outside the Society he had to build—sickening and disheartening the treachery he often encountered within the Head-Quarters. Enemies gnashing their teeth in his face around, those whom he regarded as his staunchest friends and co-workers betraying him and the Cause on the slightest provocation. Still, where hundreds in his place would have collapsed and given up the whole undertaking in despair, he, unmoved and unmovable, went on climbing up and toiling as before, unrelenting and undismayed, supported by that one thought and conviction that he was doing his duty. What other inducement has the Founder ever had, but his theosophical pledge and the sense of his duty toward T HOSE he had promised to serve to the en d of his life? There was but one beacon for him—the hand that had first pointed to him his way up: the hand of the M ASTER he loves and reveres so well, and serves so devot edly though occasionally perhaps, unwisely. President elected for life, he has nevertheless offered more than once to resign in favour of any one found worthier than him, but was never permitted to do so by the majority—not of “show of hands” but show of hearts , literally,—as few are more beloved than he is even by most of those, who may criticise occasionally his actions. And this is only natural: for cleverer in administrative capacities, more learned in philosophy, subtler in casuistry, in metaphysics or daily life policy, there may be many around him; but the whole globe may be searched through and through and no one found stauncher to his friends, truer to his word, or more devoted to real, 166  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS practical theosophy—than the President-Founder; and these are the chief requisites in a leader of such a movement—one that aims to become a Brotherhood of men. The Society needs no Loyolas; it has to shun anything approaching casuistry; nor ought we to tolerate too subtle casuists. There, where every individual has to work out his own Karma, the judgment of a casuist who takes upon himself the duty of pronouncing upon the state of a brother’s soul, or guide his conscience is of no use, and may become positively injurious. The Founder claims no more rights than everyone else in the Society: the right of private judgment, which, whenever it is found to disagree with Branches or individuals are quietly set aside and ignored—as shown by the complainants themselves. This then, is the sole crime of the would-be culprit, and no worse than this can be laid at his door. And yet what is the reward of that kind man? He, who has never refused a service, outside what he considers his official duties—to any living being; he who has redeemed dozens of men, young and old from dissipated, often immoral lives and saved others from terrible scrapes by giving them a safe refuge in the Society; he, who has placed others again, on the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"pinnacle of Saintship through their status in that Society , when otherwise they would have indeed found themselves now in the meshes of “worldliness” and perhaps worse;—he, that true friend of every theosophist, and verily “the readiest to serve and as unconscious of the service”—he is now taken to task for what?—for insignificant blunders, for useless “special, orders,” a childish, rather than untheosophical love of display, out of pure devotion to his Society. Is then human nature to be viewed so uncharitably by us, as to call untheosophical, worldly and sinful the natural impulse of a mother to dress up her child and parade it to the best advantages? The comparison may be laughed at, but if it is, it will be only by him who would, like the fanatical Christian of old, or the naked, dishevelled Yogi of India—have no more charity for the smallest human weakness. Yet, the simile is quite correct, since the Society is the child, the beloved creation of the Founder; “ORIGINAL PR O GRAMME” MANUSCRIPT  167 he may be well forgiven for this too exaggerated love for that for which he has suffered and toiled mor e than all other theosophists put together. He is called “worldly,” “ambitious of power” and untheosophical for it. Very well; let then any impartial judge compare the life of the Founder with those of most of his critics, and see which was the most theosophical ever since the Society sprang into existence. If no better results have been achieved, it is not the President who ought to be taken to task for it, but the Members themselves, as he has been ever trying to promote its growth, and the majority of “Fellows” have either done nothing, or created obstacles in the way of its progress through sins of omission as of commission. Better unwise activity, than an overdose of too wise inactivity , apathy or indifference which are always the death of an undertaking. Nevertheless, it is the members who now seek to sit in Solomon’s seat; and they tell us that the Society is useless, its President positively mischievous, and that the Head-Quarters ought to be done away with, as “the organization called Theosophical presents many features seriously obstructive to the progress of Theosophy. ” Trees, however, have to be judged by their fruits. It was just shown that no “special orders” issuing from the “Centre of Power” called Adyar, could affect in any way whatever either Branch or individual; and therefore any theosophist bent on “self-culture,” “self-involution” or any kind of selfness , is at liberty to do so; and if, instead of using his rights he will apply his brain-power to criticize other people’s actions then it is he who becomes the obstructionist and not at all the “Organization called Theosophical.” For, if theosophy is anywhere practised on this globe, it is at Adyar, at the Head-Quarters. Let “those interested in the progress of true theosophy” appealed to by the writers look around them and judge. See the Branch Societies and compare them with the group that works in that “Centre of Power.” Admire the “progress of theosophy” at Paris, London and even America. Behold, in the great “Brotherhood,” a true Pandemonium of which 168  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" the Spirit of Strife and Hatred himself might be proud! Everywhere—quarrelling, fighting for supremacy; backbiting, slandering, scandal-mongering for the last two years; a veritable battlefield, on which several members have so disgraced themselves and their Society by trying to disgrace others, that they have actually become more like hyenas than human beings by digging into the graves of the Past, in the hopes of bringing forward old forgotten slanders and scandals! At Adyar alone, at the Head-Quarters of the Theosophical Society, the Theosophists are that which they ought to be everywhere else: true theosophists and not merely philosophers and Sophists. In that centre alone are now grouped together the few solitary, practically working Members, who labor and toil, quietly and uninterruptedly, while those Brothers for whose sake they are working, sit in the dolce far niente of the West and criticise them. Is this “true theosophical and brotherly work,” to advise to put down and disestablish the only “centre” where real brotherly, humanitarian work is being accomplished? “Theosophy first and organization after.” Golden words, these. But where would Theosophy be heard of now, had not its Society been organized before its Spirit and a desire for it had permeated the whole world? And would Vedanta and other Hindu philosophies have been ever taught and studied in England outside the walls of Oxford and Cambridge, had it not been for that organization that fished them like forgotten pearls out of the Ocean of Oblivion and Ignorance and brought them forward before the profane world? Nay, kind Brothers and critics, would the Hindu exponents of that sublime philosophy themselves have ever been known outside the walls of Calcutta, had not the Founders, obedient to the O RDERS received, forced the remarkable learning and philosophy of those expon e nts upon the recognition of the two most civilized and cultured centres of Europe London and Paris? Verily it is easier to destroy than to build. The words “untheosophical” and “unbrotherly” “ORIGINAL PR O GRAMME” MANUSCRIPT  169 are ever ringing in our ears; yet, truly theosophical acts and words are not to be found in too unreasonab le a superabundance among those who use the reproof the oftener. However insignificant, and however limited the line of good deeds, the latter will have always more weight than empty and vainglorious talk, and will be theosophy whereas theories without any practical realisation are at best philosophy. Theosophy is an all-embracing Science; many are the ways leading to it, as numerous in fact as its definitions, which began by the sublime, during the day of Ammonius Saccas, and ended by the ridiculous—in Webster’s Dictionary. There is no reason why our critics should claim the right for themselves alone to know what is theosophy and to define it. There were theosophists and Theosophical Schools for the last 2,000 years, from Plato down to the mediaeval Alchemists, who knew the value of the term, it may be supposed. Therefore, when we are told that “the question"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"for consideration is not whether the Theosophical Society is doing good , but whether it is doing that kind of good which is entitled to the name of Theosophy ” — we turn round and ask: “And who is to be the judge in this mooted question?” We have heard of one of the greatest Theosophists who ever lived, who assured his audience that whosoever gave a cup of cold water to a little one in his (Theosophy’s) name, would have a greater reward than all the learned Scribes and Pharisees. “Woe to the world because of offences!” Belief in the Masters was never made an article of faith in the T.S. But for its Founders, the commands received from Them when it was established have ever been sacred. And this is what one of them wrote in a letter preserved to this day: “Theosophy must not represent merely a collection of moral verities, a bundle of metaphysical Ethics epitomized in theoretical dissertations. Theosophy must be made practical, and has, therefore, to be disencumbered of useless discussion . . . It has to find objective expression in an all-embracing code of life thoroughly impregnated with its spirit—the spirit of mutual tolerance, charity 170   BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS and love. Its followers have to set the example of a firmly outlined and as firmly applied morality befo r e they get the right to point out, even in a spirit of kindness, the absence of a like ethic Unity and singleness of purpose in other associations and individuals. As said before—no Theosophist should blame a brother whether within or outside of the association, throw slur upon his actions or denounce him * lest he should himself lose the right of being considered a theosophist.

Those who are now inclined to repudiate the Hand that traced it and feel ready to turn their backs upon the whole Past and the original programme of the T.S. are at liberty to do so. The Theosophical body is neither a Church nor a Sect and every individual opinion is entitled to a hearing. A Theosophist may progress and develop, and his views may outgrow those of the Founders, grow larger and broader in every direction, without for all that abandoning the fundamental soil upon which they were born and nurtured. It is only he who changes diametrically his opinions from one day to another and shifts his devotional views from white to black—who can be hardly trusted in his remarks and actions. But surely, this can never be the case of the two Theosophists who have now been answered . . . Meanwhile, peace and fraternal good-will to all. H. P. B LAVATSKY, Corres. Secty T.S.

Theosophy, therefore, expects and demands from the Fellows of the Society a great mutual toleration and charity for each other’s shortcomings, ungrudging mutual help in the search for truths in every department of nature—moral and physical. And this ethical standard must be unflinchingly applied to daily life. Theosophy should not represent merely a collection of moral verities, a bundle of metaphysical ethics, epitomized in theoretical dissertations. Theosophy must be made practical; and it has, therefore, to be disencumbered of useless digressions, in the sense of desultory orations and fine talk.

Theosophy can only find objective expression in an all-embracing code of life, thoroughly impregnated with the spirit of mutual tolerance, charity, and brotherly love. Its Society, as a body, has a task before it which, unless performed with the utmost discretion, will cause the world of the indifferent and the selfish to rise up in arms against it. Theosophy has to fight intolerance, prejudice, ignorance and selfishness, hidden under the mantle of hypocrisy. It has to throw all the light it can from the torch of Truth, with which its servants are entrusted. It must do this without fear or hesitation, dreading neither reproof nor condemnation. Theosophy, through its mouthpiece, the Society, has to tell the T RUTH to the very face of L IE ; to beard the tiger in its den, without thought or fear of evil consequences, and to set at defiance “ORIGINAL PROGRAMME” MANUSCRIPT  175 calumny and threats.

Its followers have, first of all, to set the example of a firmly outlined and as firmly applied morality, before they obtain the right to point out, even in a spirit of kindness, the absence of a like ethic unity and singleness of purpose in other associations or individuals. No Theosophist should blame a brother, whether within or outside of the association; neither may he throw a slur upon another’s actions or denounce him, lest he himself lose the right to be considered as a Theosophist.

Let him not show the disparity between claim and action in another, but, whether in the case of a brother, a neighbour, or simply a fellow man, let him rather ever help one weaker than himself on the arduous walk of life. The problem of true Theosophy and its great mission are, first, the working out of clear unequivocal conceptions of ethic ideas and duties, such as shall best and most fully satisfy the right and altruistic feelings in men; and second, the modelling of these conceptions for their adaptation into such forms of daily life, as shall offer a field where they may be applied with most equitableness.

Nevertheless, the opponents without stopping to think of the evident “discrepancy” between charge and fact, accused a Buddhist by profession of faith of denying reincarnation hence also by implication—Karma. Adverse to wrangling with one who was a friend and undesirous at the time to enter upon a defence of details and internal evidence—a loss of time indeed—the writer answered merely with a few sentences. But it now becomes necessary to well define the doctrine. Other critics have taken the same line, and by misunderstanding the passages to that effect in Isis they have reached the same rather extraordinary conclusions. To put an end to such useless controversies, it is proposed to explain the doctrine more clearly. Although, in view of the later more minute renderings of the esoteric doctrines, it is quite immaterial what may have been written in Isis— an encyclopedia of occult subjects in which each of these is hardly sketched— let it be known at once, that the writer maintains the correctness of every word given out upon the subject in my earlier volumes. What was said in The Theosophist of August, 1882, may now be repeated here. The passage quoted from it may be, and is, most likely “incomplete, chaotic, vague, perhaps—clumsy, as many more passages in that work, the first literary production of a foreigner who even now can hardly boast of her knowledge of the English language.” Nevertheless it is quite correct so"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"far as that collateral feature of reincarnation is therein concerned.

Sentences now explained are i n italics. Reincarnation, i.e., the appea r ance of the same individual, or rather of his astral monad, twice on the same planet, is not a rule in nature; it is an exception, like the teratological phenomenon of a two-headed infant. It is preceded by a violation of the laws of harmony of nature, and happens only when the latter, seeking to restore its disturbed equilibrium, violently throws back into earth-life the astral monad which had been tossed out of the circle of necessity by crime or accident. Thus, in cases of abortion, of infants dying before a certain age, and of congenital and incurable idiocy, nature’s original design to produce a perfect human being, has been interrupted. Therefore, while the gross matter of each of these several entities is suffered to disperse itself at death, through the vast realm of being, the immortal spirit and astral monad of the individual—the latter having been set apart to animate a frame and the former to shed its divine light on the corporeal organization— must try a second time to carry out the purpose of the creative intelligence.

When she evolves a human embryo, the intention is that a man shall be perfected—physically, intellectually, and spiritually. His body is to grow, mature, wear out, and die; his mind unfold, ripen, and be harmoniously balanced; his divine spirit illuminate and blend easily with the inner man. No human being completes its grand cycle, or the “circle of necessity,” until all these are accomplished. As the laggards in a race struggle and plod in their first quarter while the victor darts past the goal, so, in the race of immortality, some souls outspeed all the rest and reach the end, while their myriad competitors are toiling under the load of matter, close to the starting-point. Some unfortunates fall out entirely, and lose all chance of the prize; some retrace their steps and begin again. [ Ibid., Vol. I, pp. 345-46.] Clear enough this, one should say. Nature baffled tries again. No one can pass out of t h i s w o r l d ( o u r earth), without becoming perfected “ physically, morally and spiritually. ” How can this be done, unless there is a series of rebirths required for the necessary perfection in each department—to evolute in the “circle of necessity,” can surely never be found in one human life; and yet –––––––––– ‘ To the Gods m a nes who lived .’ But this kind of death does not annihilate the soul, it only transforms (one portion of) it into a lemure. ‘ Lemures ’ are the manes, or ghosts, which we know under the name lares.

Freedom from evil desire insures the possession of a miraculous power.

But to return to the real theory of reincarnation as in the esoteric teaching and its unlucky rendering in Isis. Thus, what was really meant therein, was that, the principle which does not reincarnate save the exceptions pointed out—is the false personality, the illusive human Entity defined and individualized during this short life of ours, under some specific form and name; but that which does and has to reincarnate nolens volens under the unflinching, stern rule of Karmic law—is the real EGO. This confusing of the real immortal Ego in man, with the false and ephemeral personalities it inhabits during its Manvantaric progress, lies at the root of every such misunderstanding. Now what is the one, and what is the other? The first group is— 1. The immortal Spirit—sexless, formless (arupa), an emanation from the One universal B REATH . 2. Its Vehicle— t he divine Soul—called the “Immortal Ego,” the “Divine monad,” etc., etc., which by accretions from Manas in which burns the ever-existing Jiv —the undying spark—adds to itself at the close of each incarnation the essence of that individuality that was, the aroma of the culled flower that is no more. What is the false personality? It is that bundle of desires, aspirations, affection and hatred, in short of action, manifested by a human being on this earth during one incarnation and under the form of one personality.*"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"–––––––––– * A proof how our theosophical teachings have taken root in every class of Society and even in English literature may be seen by reading Mr. Norman Pearson’s article “Before Birth” in The Nineteenth Century for September, 1886. Therein, theosophical ideas and teachings are speculated upon without acknowledgment or the smallest reference to theosophy, and among others, we see with regard to the author’s theories on the Ego, the following: “How much then of the individual personality is supposed to go to heaven or to hell? –––––––––– 186  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Certainly it is not all this, which as a fact for us, the deluded, material, and materially thinking lot— i s Mr. So and So, or Mrs. somebody else—that remains immortal, or is ever reborn.

Nothing remains now of that “bundle” to go to the next incarnation, except the seed for future Karma that Manas may have united to its immortal group, to form with it—the disembodied Higher Self in “Devachan.” As to the four lower principles, that which becomes of them is found in most classics, from which we mean to quote at length for our defence.

If, on the other hand, the soul is something distinct from all our mental equipment except the sense of self, are we not confronted by the incomprehensible notion of a personality without any attributes?” To this query the author answers as any true theosophist would: “. . . the difficulties of the question really spring from a misconception of the true nature of these attributes. The components of our mental equipment—appetites, aversions, feelings, tastes, and qualities generally—are not absolute but relative existences. . . .

They are not inherent and necessary elements of the soul. . . . . and will disappear or become modified, etc.” (pp. 356-57). In other words the theosophical doctrine is adopted.

They are on their defence. And they prove what they say, i.e., that no “ personality ” has ever yet been “reincarnated on the same planet” ( our earth, this once there is no mistake) save in the three exceptional cases above cited. Adding to these a fourth case, which is the deliberate, conscious act of adeptship; and that such an astral body belongs neither to the body nor the soul, still less to the immortal spirit of man, the following is brought forward and proofs cited. Before one brings out on the strength of undeniable manifestations, theories as to what produces them and claims at once on prima facie evidence that it is the spirits of the departed mortals that re-visit us, it behooves one to first study what antiquity has declared upon the subject. Ghosts and apparitions, materialized and semi-material “ SPIRITS ” have not originate d with Allan Kardec, nor at Rochester. If those beings whose invariable habit it is to give themselves out for souls and the phantoms of the dead, choose to do so and succeed, it is only because the cautious philosophy of old is now replaced by an a priori conceit, and unproven assumptions. The first question is to be settled—“Have spirits any kind of substance to clothe themselves with?” Answer: That which is now called périsprit in France, and a “materialized Form” in England and America, was called in days of old peri-psyche, and peri-nous, hence was well known to the old Greeks. Have they a body whether gaseous, fluidic, ethereal, material or semi-material? No; we say this on the authority of the occult teachings the world over. For with the Hindus atma or spirit is Arupa (bodiless), and with the Greeks also. Even in the Roman Catholic Church the angels of Light as those of Darkness are absolutely incorporeal: “ meri spiritus, omnes corporis expertes ” and in the words of the “S ECRET D OCTRINE ,” primordial. Emanations of the 188  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS undifferentiated Principle, the Dhyan Chohans of the ONE (First) category or pure Spiritual Essence, are for m ed of the Spirit of the one Element; the second category of [or?] the second Emanation of the Soul of the Elements; the third have a “ mind body” to which they are not subject, but that they can assume and govern as a body, subject to them, pliant to their will in form and substance. Parting from this (third) category, they (the spirits, angels, Devas or Dhyan Chohans) have BODIES , the first rupa group of which is composed of one element Ether ; the second, of two—ether and fire; the third, of three—Ether, fire and water; the fourth, of four—Ether, air, fire and water. Then comes man, who, besides the four elements, has the fifth that predominates in him—Earth: therefore he suffers. Of the Angels, as said by St. Augustine and Peter Lombard, their bodies are made to act not to suffer. It is earth and water, humor et humus, that gives an aptitude for suffering and passivity, ad patientiam, and Ether and Fire for action. The spirits or human monads, belonging to the first, or undifferentiated essence, are thus incorporeal; but their third principle (or the human Fifth— Manas ) can in conjunction with its vehicle become Kama rupa and Mayavi rupa— body of desire or “illusion body.” After death, the best, noblest, purest qualities of Manas or the human soul, ascending along with the divine Monad into"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Devachan, whence no one emerges from or returns, except at the time of reincarnation—what is that then which appears under the double mask of the spiritual Ego or soul of the departed individual?

The astral bodies— the remnants a nd dregs of a mortal being which has been disembodied, when they do appear, are not the individuals they claim to be, but only their simulacra. And such was the belief of the whole of antiquity, from Homer to Swedenborg; from the third race down to our own day. More than one devoted spiritualist has hitherto quoted Paul as corroborating his claim that spirits do and can appear. “There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body,” etc., etc. ( I Cor ., xv , 44); but one has only to study closer the verses preceding and following the one quoted, to perceive that what St. Paul meant was quite different from the sense claimed for it. Surely there is a spiritual body, but it is not identical with the astral form contained in the “natural” man. The “spiritual” is formed only by our individuality unclothed and transformed after death; for the apostle takes care to explain in verses 51-53: “ sed non omnes immutabimur .” “Behold, I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed . . . For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.” But this is no proof except for the Christians. Let us see what the old Egyptians and the Neo-platonists—both “ theurgists ” par excellence, thought on the subject: They divided man into three principal groups subdivided into principles as we do: pure immortal spirit; the “Spectral Soul” ( a luminous phantom ) and the gross material body. Apart from the latter which was considered as the terrestrial shell, these groups were divided into six principles: (1) Kha, “vital body”; (2 ) Khaba, “astral form,” or shadow; (3) Khou, “animal soul”; (4) Akh, “terrestrial intelligence”; (5) Sa, “the divine soul” ( or Buddhi ) ; and (6) Sah or mummy, the functions of which began after death. Osiris was the highest uncreated spirit, for –––––––––– same path of p rogress elect men.

Writing an article for The Theosophist, while at Ostende, in July, 1886 (published in Vol. VIII, No. 85, October, 1886, pp. 1-8), on “Ancient Magic in Modern Science,” she closes it with the following paragraph: “Some twenty years ago, archæology was enriched with a very curious Egyptian document giving the views of that ancient religion upon the subject of ghosts ( manes ) and magic in general. It is called the “Harris papyrus on Magic “ (Papyrus Magique). It is extremely curious in its bearing upon the esoteric teachings of Occult Theosophy, and is very suggestive. It is left for our next article—on M AGIC .” The Papyrus r eferred to in this closing paragraph is precisely the main subject-matter of her essay on “Egyptian Magic,” as published in “The Secret Doctrine, Volume III.” This essay, however, was not published in The Theosophist, or in any other journal at the time. It is quite possible that in October, 1886, when H.P.B., still at Ostende, was writing for The Path her present essay on “Reincarnation and Spirits,” she had decided to use “Egyptian Magic” as one of the Appendices to The Secret Doctrine, instead of running it as an article in a magazine.

Most of our facts, however, come from a Chinese gentleman residing for some years in Europe. Man, according to the Chinaman, is composed of four root-substances and three acquired “semblances.” This is the magical and universal occult tradition, dating from an antiquity which has its origin in the night of time. A Latin poet shows the same source of information in his country, when declaring that:— Bis duo sunt hominis: manes, caro, spiritus, umbra; Quatuor ista loc a bis duo suscipiunt. Terra tegit carnem, tumulum circumvolat umbra, Orcus habet manes, spiritus astra petit. 2 The phantom known and described in the Celestial Empire is quite orthodox according to occult teac h ings, though there exist several theories in China upon it. The human soul, says the chief (temple) teaching, helps man to become a rational and intelligent creature, but it is neither simple (homogeneous) nor spiritual; it is a compound of all that is subtle in matter. This “soul” 202   BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS is divided by its nature and actions into two principal parts: the L ING and the H OUEN . The"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"ling is the better adapted of the two for spiritual and intellectual operations, and has an “upper” ling or soul over it which is divine. Moreover, out of the union of the lower ling and houen is formed, during man’s life, a third and mixed being, fit for both intellectual and physical processes, for good and evil, while the houen is absolutely bad. Thus we have four principles in these two “substances,” which correspond, as is evident, to our Buddhi, the divine “upper” ling ; to Manas, the lower ling whose twin, the houen, stands for Kama-rupa—the body of passion, desire and evil; and then we have in the “mixed being” the outcome or progeny of both ling and houen— the “Mayavi,” the astral body. Then comes the definition of the third root-substance. This is attached to the body only during life, the body being the fourth substance, pure matter; and after the death of the latter, separating itself from the corpse—but not before its complete dissolution—it vanishes in thin air like a shadow with the last particle of the substance that generated it. This is of course Prâna, the life-principle or vital form. Now, when man dies, the following takes place:—the “upper” ling ascends heavenwards—into Nirvâna, the paradise of Amitâbha, or any other region of bliss that agrees with the respective sect of each Chinaman—carried off by the Spirit of the Dragon of Wisdom (the seventh principle); the body and its principle vanish gradually and are annihilated; remain the ling-houen and the “mixed being.” If the man was good, the “mixed being” disappears also after a time; if he was bad and was entirely under the sway of houen, the absolutely evil principle, then the latter transforms his “mixed being” into koueïs— which answers to the Catholic idea of a damned soul*—and, imparting to it a terrible vitality and –––––––––– * The spiritual p ortion of the ling becomes chen (divine and saintly), after death, to become hien— an absolute saint (a Nirvanee) when joined entirely with the “Dragon of Wisdom.” –––––––––– CHINESE SPIRITS   203 power, the koueïs becomes the alter ego and the executioner of houen in all his wicked deeds. The houe n and koueïs unite into one shadowy but strong entity, and may, by separating at will, and acting in two different places at a time, do terrible mischief.

It is, if you so like it, something vague, something between a spirit, a genii , and vitality ” (see Huc’s Voyage à la Chine, Vol. II, p. 394). He seems to regard the houen as the future operator in the business of resurrection, which it will effect by attracting to itself the atomic substance of the body, which will be thus reformed on the day of resurrection. This answers well enough the Christian idea of one body and merely one personality to be resurrected. But if the houen has to unite on that day the atoms of all the bodies the Monad had passed through and inhabited, then even that “very cunning creature” might find itself not quite equal to the occasion. However, as while the ling is plunged in felicity, its ex-houen is left behind to wander and suffer, it is evident that the houen and the “elementary” are identical.

If the body has been burned before judicial enquiry, the"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"houen reproduces on its body the wounds or lesions received by the murdered man—the crime is proven and justice takes note of it. The sacred books of the temples contain the complete formulae of such evocations, and even the name of the murderer may be forced from the complacent houen. In this the Chinamen were followed by Christian nations, however. During the Middle Ages the suspected murderer was placed by the judges before the victim, and if at that moment blood began to flow from the open wounds, it was held as a sign that the accused was the criminal. This belief survives to this day in France, Germany, Russia, and all the Slavonian countries. “The wounds of a murdered man will re-open at the approach of his murderer,” says a jurisprudential work (Binsfeld, De Conf. Malef :, p. 137). 6 “The houen can neither be buried underground nor drowned; he travels above the ground and prefers keeping at home.” In the province of Ho-nan the teaching varies. Delaplace, a bishop in China,* tells of the “heathen Chinee” most extraordinary stories with regard to this subject. Every man, they say, has three houens in him.

The Theosophists and Occultists divide man into seven principles and speak of a divine and animal soul; but they add that Spirit being one and indivisible, all these “souls” and principles are only its aspects. Spirit alone is immortal, infinite, and the one reality—the rest is all evanescent and temporary, illusion and delusion. Des Mousseaux is very wrath with the late Baron Dupotet, who places an intelligent “spirit” in each of our organs, simply because he is unable to grasp the Baron’s idea. * Annales de la propagation de la foi , t.

Between these and those who, like Des Mousseaux and De Mirville, write volumes—a whole library!—to prove that with the exception of a few Biblical apparitions and those that have favoured Christian saints and good Catholics, there never was a phantom, ghost, spirit, or “god,” that had appeared that was not a ferouer , and impostor , a usurpator— Satan, in short, in one of his masquerades—there is a long way and a wide margin for him who would study Occult laws and Esoteric philosophy. “A god who eats and drinks and receives sacrifice and honour can be but an evil spirit,” argues De Mirville. “The bodies of the evil spirits who were angels have deteriorated by their fall and partake of the qualities of a more condensed air” (ether?), teaches Des Mousseaux ( Le Monde Magique, p. 287). 10 “And this is the reason of their appetite when they devour the funeral repasts the Chinese serve before them to propitiate them; they are demons.” Well, if we go back to the supposed origin of Judaism and the Israelite nation, we find angels of light doing just the same—if “good appetite” be a sign of Satanic nature. And it is the same Des Mousseaux who, unconsciously lays, for himself and his religion, a trap. “See,” he exclaims, “the angels of God descend under the green trees near Abraham’s tent. They eat with appetite the bread and meat, the butter and the milk prepared for them by the patriarch” ( Gen., xviii, 2 et seq .). Abraham dressed a whole “calf tender and good” and “they did eat” (verses 7 and 8); and baked cakes and milk and butter besides.

So can a “John King” we are assured, and a Pekin houen no doubt.

In describing Chinese ideas regarding the human soul, H.P.B. summarizes various passages from pp. 212, 223 - 24, and quotes from pp. 221-22, of Vol. XV of the above-mentioned work. The subject is treated therein in a section entitled: “Extrait d’une Lettre de M. Amiot, Missionnaire, écrite de Pékin, le 16 octobre 1787. Sur la secte des Tao-sée. ” 2 These verses are also quoted by H.P.B. in her essay on “Theories about Reincarnation and Spirits,” where she cr e dits them to Ovid. They are also brought in, in a somewhat incomplete form, in Isis Unveiled , I, 362, where they are attributed to Lucretius who is supposed to portray old Ennius as saying these words. The two last lines only occur again in Isis Unveiled , I, 37, where they are attributed to Ovid. In spite of an exhaustive search having been made, no such verses have been found either in Lucretius or i n Ovid. 210  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS 3 It is not known what particular edition of Henry Cornelius Agrippa’s work this passage is quoted from. Th e Latin text, as quoted, seems to contain a number of errors. For this reason, rather than to correct the text, we give below the Latin original as it occurs in the 1533 edition (Beringo Fratres, Lugduni) of De occulta philosophia libri tres , by Agrippa of Nettesheim, namely in Vol. III, Chapter xlii, p. 304: “Ex his quae iam dicta sunt patet, quod animae illae que post mortem adhuc relicta corpora diligut, quemadm o du sunt animae corporum sepultum debita carentiu, seu que corpus suum violenta morte reliquerunt, & adhuc in turbido illo humidoq; spiritu circa cadavera sua oberrant, tanq circa cognatum aliquod eas alliciens, cognitis his mediis per quae quondam suis coiungebantur corporibus, per consimiles vapores, liquores nidoresq; facile evocari & allici possunt, adhibitis etia certis artificialibus luminibus, catibus, sonis & huiusmodi, que ipsam animae imaginativa spiritalemq. . .” In the English translation by J.

As to Le Fantôme Humain, this appears to be only a subtitle for the later chapters of the work by des Moussea u x entitled Les médiateurs et les moyens de la magie, and not a separate work by that author. With regard to Porphyry’s De sacrificio et magia, a mediaeval condensation of his De abstinentia carnis, a passage similar to what H.P.B. mentions, but not identical with it, occurs in Book II, 47. Vide Thomas Taylor’s Select Works of Porphyry , p. 82. 4 H.P.B. makes reference here to a very rare work by Petrus Thyraeus (1546-1601), entitled Loca infesta, h o c est, de infestis ob molestantus daemoniorum et defunctorum hominum spiritus locis . . .

Paris: Lucien Dorbon, CHINESE SPIR I TS  211 1912. 3 vols.) under the name of Thiresus of Nuys, Diocese of Cologne, and says he was a Jesuit, nothing else s e ems to be readily available concerning this writer. 5 The translation in the Loeb Classical Series does not seem to convey this meaning, however. It runs as follo ws: “The Soul of man, he says, is divided into three parts, intelligence (nous), reason (phren), and passion (thumo s ). Intelligence and passion are possessed by other animals as well, but reason by man alone. The seat of the soul extends from the heart to the brain; the part of it which is in the heart is passion, while the parts located in the brain are reason and intelligence. The senses are distillations from these.” 6 Reference is here made to Petrus Binsfeldius and his Tractatus de Confessionibus Maleficorum e t Sagarum recognitus et auctus, etc. An et quanta fides iis adhibenda sit?

He also wrote Commentarius intitulum Codicis de Maleficis (same city and publisher, 1591, 8-vo), which is a supplement to the first-mentioned work, and is often bound together with it. The Latin original is as follows: “Nam fuerat mortuus quidam homo nocturno tempore, & nescie batur a quo: Attamen multi erant suspecti de mo r te sua, & quidam homo senex dixit mihi: Domine gubernator, si vultis scire veritate huius homicidij, faciatis cora! vobis portare cadauer illuis mortui, postea faciatis vocare illos, suspecti sunt de illo homicidio, & veniat unus post alium, ubi est cadauer illud, tunc cum superuenit verus homicida, vulnera ipsius fluent sanguinem de nouo: Quo audito feci coram me portare illud cadauer, & feci vocare illos suspectos de uno in unum, & cum superuenit verus homicida, vulnera illius cadaueris inceperunt effluere, & emittere sanguinem, de quo summe sui admiratus . . .” 7 H.

The chapter is entitled “That there is a threefold keeper in man, and from whence each of them proceeds” The sentence, in its more complete form, is as follows: “Triplex unicuique homini daemon bonus est proprius custos, unus quidem sacer, alter geniture, tertius professionis. . .” which, in the translation of J.F., is rendered as: “Every man hath a threefold good Demon, as a proper keeper, or preserver, the one whereof is holy, another of the nativity, and the other of profession. . .” (p. 410.) 9 The passages seem to have a number of inaccuracies and a considerable amount of text is left out, as indicat e d by dots. It is from Chapter xliii, pages 306 and 308. The Latin text is as follows: Anima humana constat mente, ratione & idolo: mens illuminat rationem, ratio fluit in idolum, omnia una est a nima. Ratio nisi per mentem illuminatur, ab errore no est immunis: Mens autem lumen rationi non praebet, nisi lucescente deo, primo videlicet lumine: prima enim lux in deo est supereminens omne intellectu: qua propter non potest lux intelligibilis vocari, sed lux illa quando infunditurmenti, fit intellectualis atque intelligi potest: deinde quando per metem infunditur rationi, fit rationalis, ac potest non solum intelligi, sed etiam cogitari . . . . . . .

In chapter xxxi ( et seq .) of Genesis , in Ur of the Chaldees in Mesopotamia, wherein the ancestors of Abraham, Serug and Terah, worshipped little idols in clay which they called their gods ; and where also, in Haran, Rachel stole the images ( teraphim ) of her father Laban. Jacob may have forbidden the worship of those gods, yet one finds 325 years after that prohibition, the Mosaic Jews adoring “the gods of the Amorites” all the same ( Joshua , xxiv, 14-15). The teraphim-gods of Laban exist to this day among certain tribes of Mussulmans on Persian territory. They are small statuettes of tutelary genii, or gods, which are consulted on every occasion. The Rabbis explain that Rachel had no other motive for stealing her father’s gods than that of preventing his learning from them the direction she and her husband Jacob had taken, lest he should prevent them from leaving his home once more. Thus, it was not piety, or the fear of the Lord God of Israel, but simply a dread of the indiscretion of the gods that made her secure them.

It is most likely that this is meant to be a reference to a work known as Philonis Judaei Antiquitatum Biblicarum liber, which was published at Basle in 1527, edited by Johannes Sichart.

Sichart used for his editorial work two MSS.: one belonging to the Monastery of Lorsch, and another belonging to Fulda; the latter has since disappeared. There are MSS. of this work in the Vatican Library (Vaticanus Latinus 488, 15th cent.) and the Vienna Library (Vindob. Lat. 446). It would appear that for several centuries the existence of this work, as edited by Sichart, was unknown or rather forgotten, until brought to light in the last years of the 19th century. Yet the Latin text of this work on Biblical Antiquities had been circulated many times together with the translations of genuine works by Philo Alexandrinus, thus probably giving rise to the belief that it was from the pen of Philo. This work is a version of Biblical history from Adam to the death of Saul, and falls under the general category of Apocrypha.

They were statues or regular idols in the human shape. The Chaldeans exposed them to the beams of certain planets for the latter to imbue them with their virtues and potency. These were for purposes of astro-magic; the regular teraphim for those of necromancy and sorcery, in most cases. The spirits of the dead (elementaries) were attached to them by magic art, and they were used for various sinful purposes. Ugolino* puts in the mouth of the sage Gamaliel, St. Paul’s master (or guru ), the following words, which he quotes, he says, from his Capito, chap. xxxvi: They [the possessors of such necromantic teraphim ] killed a newborn baby, cut off its head, and placed under its tongue, salted and oiled, a little gold lamina in which the name of an evil spirit was perforated; then, after suspending that head on the wall of their chamber, they lighted lamps before it, and prostrated on the ground, they conversed with it. † –––––––––– * Blasius Ugolino, Thesaurus Antiquitatum Sacrarum, etc., Vol. XXIII, col. cccclxxv.

Semelê, the daughter of Cadmus, having in consequence of a fright given premature birth to a child of seven months, Cadmus, in order to follow the custom of his country and to give it (the babe) a supermundane origin which would make it live after death, enclosed its body within a gold statue, and made of it an idol for which a special cult and rites were established.

Pope Sylvester II was publicly accused by Cardinal Benno of sorcery, on account of his “Brazen Oracular Head.” These heads and other talking statues, trophies of the magical skill of monks and bishops, were fac-similes of the animated gods of the ancient temples. Benedict IX, John XX, and VIth and VIIth Popes Gregory are all known in history as sorcerers and magicians. Notwithstanding such an array of facts to show that the Latin Church has despoiled the ancient Jews of all—aye, even of their knowledge of black art inclusively—one of their advocates of modern times, namely, the Marquis de Mirville, is not ashamed to publish against the modern Jews, the most terrible and foul of accusations! In his violent polemics with the French symbologists, who try to find a philosophical explanation for ancient Bible customs and rites, he says: “We pass over the symbolic significations that are sought for to explain all such customs of the idolatrous Jews [their human teraphim and severed baby-heads], because we do not believe in them [such explanations] at all. But we do believe, for one, that ‘the head’ consulted by the Scandinavian Odin in every difficult affair was a teraphim of the same [magic] class.

For the likeness of any person, in whatever form and mode, of whatever material, may be turned into a deadly weapon against the original by a really learned practitioner of the black art. Legal authorities during the Middle Ages, and even some of 200 years ago, were not wrong in putting to death those in whose possession small wax figures of their enemies were found, for it was murder contemplated, pure and simple. “Thou shalt not draw the vital spirits of thy enemy, or of any person into his simulacrum ,” for “this is a heinous crime against nature.” And again: “Any object into which the fiat of a spirit has been drawn is dangerous, and must not be left in the hands of the ignorant . . . . An expert (in magic) has to be called to purify it.” ( Pract. Laws of Occult Science, Book V, Coptic copy.) In a kind of “Manual” of Elementary Occultism, it is said: “To make a bewitched object ( fetish ) harmless, its parts have to be reduced to atoms (broken), and the whole buried in damp soil”—(follow instructions, unnecessary in a publication).* That which is called “vital spirits” is the astral body. “Souls, whether united or separated from their bodies, have a corporeal substance inherent to their nature ,” says St. Hilarius ( Commentarius in Matthaeum, cap. v, 8).† –––––––––– * The author o f A Fallen Idol,— whether through natural intuition or study of occult laws, it is for him to say—shows knowledge of this fact by making Nebelsen say that the spirit or the tirthankara was paralyzed and torpid during the time his idol had been buried in India.

However, by turning to pages 234-240 of the Volume published in 1897 in London under the editorship of Annie Besant, and entitled “The Secret Doctrine, Volume III,” the student will find a brief essay on “The Idols and the Teraphim,” which in our estimation is precisely the material spoken of by H.

The “vampire” theory can hardly be a superstition altogether. Throughout all Europe, in Germany, Styria, Moldavia, Servia, France and Russia, those bodies of the deceased who are believed to have become vampires, have special exorcismal rites established for them by their respective Churches.

Till that moment the “spectral soul” was the vehicle of the divine soul and the pure spirit. But, as soon as the flames had devoured the physical envelope, the spiritual soul, separating itself from the simulacrum of man, ascended to its new home of unalloyed bliss (Devachan or Swarga), while the spectral eidôlon descended into the regions of Hades ( limbus, purgatory, Kama loka ). “I have terminated my earthly career,” exclaims Dido, “my glorious spectre [astral body], the IMAGE of my person, will now descend into the womb of the earth.”†"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"–––––––––– * Even burning does not affect its interference or prevent it entirely—since it can avail itself of the ashes.

Rolfe (Loeb Classical Series) translates it as follows: “8. The spirit pervading all the elements, seeing that they are eternal bodies, is always and everywhere strong in the power of prescience, and as the result of the knowledge which we acquire through varied studies makes us also sharers in the gifts of divination; and the elemental powers, when propitiated by divers rites, supply mortals with words of prophecy, as if from the veins of inexhaustible founts.” — Compiler .] † Those that the Kabalists call elementary spirits are sylphs, gnomes, undines and salamanders, nature-spirits, in short. The spirits of the angels formed a distinct class. –––––––––– THE IDOLS AND THE TERAPHIM  235 Every god had such instruments of divination to speak through. Each had his specialty. Serapis gave instruction on agriculture; Anubis taught sciences; Horus advised upon psychic and spiritual matters; Isis was consulted on the rising of the Nile, and so on.* This historical fact, furnished by one of the ablest and most erudite among the Jesuits, is unfortunat e for the prestige of the “Lord God of Israel” with regard to his claims to priority and to his being the one living God. Jehovah, on the admission of the Old Testament itself, conversed with his elect in no other way, and this places him on a par with every other Pagan God, even of the inferior classes. In Judges, xvii, we read of Micah having an ephod and a teraphim fabricated, and consecrating them to Jehovah (see the Septuagint and the Vulgate ); these objects were made by a founder from the two hundred shekels of silver given to him by his mother. True, King James’ “Holy Bible” explains this little bit of idolatry by saying: In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.† Yet the act must have been orthodox, since Micah, after hiring a priest, a diviner, for his ephod and t e raphim, declares: “Now know I that the Lord will do me good.” And if Micah’s act—who Had an house of Gods, and made an ephod and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons‡ –––––––––– * Oedipus Aegy p tiacus , Vol. II, Pars Altera, Cl.

How can the Latin Church blame the act, since. Kircher, one of her best writers, calls the teraphim “the holy instruments of primitive revelations”; since Genesis shows us Rebecca going “to enquire of the Lord,”* and the Lord answering her (certainly through the teraphim), and delivering to her several prophecies? And if this be not sufficient, there is Saul, who deplores the silence of the ephod,† and David who consults the thummim, and receives oral advice from the Lord as to the best way of killing his enemies. The thummim and urim, however—the object in our days of so much conjecture and speculation—was not an invention of the Jews, nor had it originated with them, despite the minute instruction given about it by Jehovah to Moses. For the priest-hierophant of the Egyptian temples wore a breast-plate of precious stones, in every way similar to that of the high priest of the Israelites. The high-priests of Egypt wore suspended on their necks an image of sapphire, called Truth , the manife s tation of truth becoming evident in it. Seldenus is not the only Christian writer who assimilates the Jewish to the Pagan teraphim, and e x pressed a conviction that the former had borrowed them from the Egyptians. Moreover, we are told by Döllinger, a preëminently Roman Catholic writer: The teraphim were used and remained in many Jewish families to the days of Josiah.‡ As to the personal opinion of Döllinger, a papist, and of Seldenus, a Protestant—both of whom trace J e hovah –––––––––– * Genesis , xxv, 22, et seq . † The ephod was a linen garment worn by the high priest, but as the thummim was attached to it, the entire paraphernalia of divination was often comprised in that single word, ephod.

Seldenus is right, however, in arguing that in the days of old, all such modes of communication had been primarily established for purposes of divine and angelic communications only. But The holy Spirit (spirits, rather) spake [not] to the children of Israel [alone] by urim and thummim, while the tabernacle r emained, as Dr. A. Cruden would have people believe. Nor had the Jews alone need of a “tabernacle” f or such a kind of theophanic, or divine communication; for no Bath-Kol (or “Daughter of the divine Voice”), called thummim, could be heard whether by Jew, Pagan, or Christian, were there not a fit tabernacle for it. The “tabernacle” was simply the archaic telephone of those days of Magic when Occult powers were acquired by Initiation, just as they are now. The nineteenth century has replaced with an electric telephone the “tabernacle” of specified metals, wood, and special arrangements, and has natural mediums instead of high priests and hierophants. Why should people wonder, then, that instead of reaching Planetary Spirits and Gods, believers should now communicate with no greater beings than elementals and animated shells—the demons of Porphyry? Who these were, he tells us candidly in his work On the Good and Bad Demons; They whose ambition is to be taken for Gods, and whose leader demands to be recognized as the Supreme God. * M ost decidedly—and it is not the Theosophists who will ever deny the fact—there are good as well as b ad spirits, beneficent and malevolent “Gods” in all ages.

If anything –––––––––– * De abstinentia , II , 41, 42. –––––––––– 238  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS proves this, it is, most decidedly, the numberless theological blunders made in this direction. It i s idle to call the Gods of the heathen “devils,” and then to copy their symbols in such a servile manner, enforcing the distinction between the good and the bad with no weightier proof than that they are respectively Christian and Pagan. [The planets—the elements of the Zodiac—have not figured only at Heliopolis as the twelve stones called the “mysteries of the elements” (elementorum arcana). On the authority of many an orthodox Christian writer they were found also in Solomon’s temple, and may be seen to this day in several old Italian churches, and even in Notre Dame of Paris.] One would really say that the warning in Clement’s Stromateis has been given in vain, though he is supposed to quote words pronounced by St. Peter.

One fails to perceive in it, therefore, either an apocrypha or a “fairy-tale.”] The above-named Chaldaean Initiate lived at a period far anterior to that ascribed to Moses, in whose day the Sacred Science of the sanctuary was still in a flourishing condition.

Cables, the devoted president of the T.S. of that place, her joint editorial with Mr. W. T. Brown. This sudden revulsion of feeling is perhaps quite natural in the lady, for she has never had the opportunities given her as Mr. Brown has; and her feeling when she writes that after “a great desire . . . . . to be put into communication with the Theosophical Mahatmas we [they] have come to the conclusion that it is useless to strain the psychical eyes towards the Himalayas . . . . . ” is undeniably shared by many theosophists. Whether the complaints are justified, and also whether it is the “Mahatmas” or theosophists themselves who are to blame for it is a question that remains to be settled. It has been a pending case for several years and will have to be now decided, as the two complainants declare over their signatures that “we [they] need not run after Oriental mystics, who deny their ability to help us. ” The last sentence, in italics, has to be seriously examined. I ask the privilege to make a few remarks thereon. To begin with, the tone of the whole article is that of a true manifesto. Condensed and weeded of its exuberance of Biblical expressions it comes to this paraphrastical declaration: “We have knocked at their door, and they have not answered us; we have prayed for bread, they have denied us even a stone.” The charge is quite serious; nevertheless, that it is neither just nor fair—is what I propose to show. As I was the first in the United States to bring the existence of our Masters into publicity; and, having exposed the holy names of two members of a Brotherhood hitherto unknown to Europe and America (save to a few mystics and Initiates of every age), yet sacred and revered throughout the East, and especially India, causing vulgar speculation and curiosity to grow around those blessed 242  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS names, and finally leading to a public rebuke, I believe it my duty to contradict the fitness of the latter b y explaining the whole situation, as I feel myself the chief culprit. It may do good to some, perchance, and will interest some others. Let no one think withal, that I come out as a champion or a defender of those who most"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"assuredly need no defence. What I intend, is to present simple facts , and let after this the situation be judged on its own merits. To the plain statement of our brothers and sisters that they have been “living on husks,” “hunting after strange gods” without receiving admittance, I would ask in my turn, as plainly: “Are you sure of having knocked at the right door? Do you feel certain that you have not lost your way by stopping so often on your journey at strange doors, behind which lie in wait the fiercest enemies of those you were searching for ? Our M ASTERS are not “a jealous god”; they are simply holy mortals, nevertheless , h owever, higher than any in this world, morally, intellectually and spiritually. However holy and advanced in the science of the Mysteries—they are still men, members of a Brotherhood, who are the first in it to show themselves subservient to its time-honoured laws and rules. And one of the first rules in it demands that those who start on the journey Eastward, as candidates to the notice and favors of those who are the custodians of those Mysteries, should proceed by the straight road, without stopping on every sideway and path seeking to join other “Masters” and professors often of the Left-Hand Science, that they should have confidence and show trust and patience, besides several other conditions to fulfill. Failing in all of this from first to last, what right has any man or woman to complain of the liability of the Masters to help them? Truly “‘The Dwellers of the Threshold’ are within!” Once that a theosophist would become a candidate for either chelaship or favours, he must be aware of the mutual pledge, tacitly, if not formally offered and accepted between the two parties, and, that such a pledge is sacred. “ T H E T H E O S O P H ICAL MAHATMAS”  243 It is a bond of seven years of probation. If during that time, notwithstanding the many human shortco m ings and mistakes of the candidate (save two which it is needless to specify in print) he remains throughout every temptation true to the chosen Master, or Masters (in the case of lay candidates), and as faithful to the Society founded at their wish and under their orders, then the theosophist will be initiated into –––– thenceforward allowed to communicate with his guru unreservedly, all his failings, save this one, as specified, may be overlooked: they belong to his future Karma, but are left for the present, to the discretion and judgment of the Master. He alone has the power of judging whether even during those long seven years the chela will be favoured regardless of his mistakes and sins, with occasional communications with, and from the guru. The latter thoroughly posted as to the causes and motives that led the candidate into sins of omission and commission is the only one to judge of the advisability or inadvisability of bestowing encouragement; as he alone is entitled to it, seeing that he is himself under the inexorable law of Karma, which no one from the Zulu savage up to the highest archangel can avoid—and that he has to assume the great responsibility of the causes created by himself. Thus, the chief and the only indispensable condition required in the candidate or chela on probation, is simply unswerving fidelity to the chosen Master and his purposes. This is"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"a condition sine qua non; not as I have said, on account of any jealous feeling, but simply because the magnetic rapport between the two once broken, it becomes at each time doubly difficult to re-establish it again; and that it is neither just nor fair, that the Masters should strain their powers for those whose future course and final desertion they very often can plainly foresee. Yet, how many of those, who, expecting as I would call it “favours by anticipation,” and being disappointed, instead of humbly repeating mea culpa, tax the Masters with selfishness and injustice. They will deliberately break the thread of connection ten times in one year, and yet expect each time to be taken back on the old lines! I know of one 244  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS theosophist—let him be nameless though it is hoped he will recognize himself—a quiet, intelligent y o ung gentleman, a mystic by nature, who, in his ill-advised enthusiasm and impatience, changed Masters and his ideas about half a dozen times in less than three years. First he offered himself, was accepted on probation and took the vow of chelaship; about a year later, he suddenly got the idea of getting married, though he had several proofs of the corporeal presence of his Master, and had several favours bestowed upon him. Projects of marriage failing, he sought “Masters” under other climes, and became an enthusiastic Rosicrucian; then he returned to theosophy as a Christian mystic; then again sought to enliven his austerities with a wife; then gave up the idea and turned a spiritualist. And now having applied once more “to be taken back as a chela” (I have his letter) and his Master remaining silent—he renounced him altogether, to seek in the words of the above manifesto—his old “Essenian Master and to test the spirits in his name” The able and respected editor of the Occult Word and her Secretary are right, and have chosen the only true path in which with a very small dose of blind faith, they are sure to encounter no deceptions or disappointments. “It is pleasant to some of us,” they say, “to obey the call of the ‘Man of Sorrows’ who will not turn any away because they are unworthy or have not scored up a certain percentage of personal merit.” How do they know? Unless they accept the cynically awful and pernicious dogma of the Protestant Church, that teaches the forgiveness of the blackest crime, provided the murderer believes sincerely that the blood of his “Redeemer” has saved him at the last hour—what is it but blind unphilosophical faith? Emotionalism is not philosophy; and Buddha devoted his long self-sacrificing life to tear people away precisely from that evil breeding superstition. Why speak of Buddha then, in the same breath? The doctrine of salvation by personal merit, and self -forgetfulness is the corner-stone of the teaching of the Lord Buddha. Both the writers may have and very likely they did—“hunt after strange gods”; but these were not our MASTERS. They have “denied Him “THE THEOSOP H ICAL MAHATMAS”  245 "},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"thrice” and now propose “with bleeding feet and prostrate spirit” to “pray that He [Jesus] may take us [them] once more under His wing,” etc. The “Nazarene Master” is sure to oblige them so far. Still they will be “living on husks ” plus “blind faith.” But in this they are the best judges, and no one has a right to meddle with their private beliefs in our Society; and heaven grant that they should not in their fresh disappointment turn our bitterest enemies one day Yet, to those Theosophists, who are displeased with the Society in general, no one has ever made to you any rash promises; least of all, has either the Society or its founders ever offered their “Masters” as a chromo-premium to the best behaved. For years every new member has been told that he was promised nothing, but had everything to expect only from his own personal merit. The theosophist is left free and untrammeled in his actions. Whenever displeased— alia tentanda via est*— no harm in trying elsewhere; unless, indeed one has offered himself and is decided to win the Masters’ favors. To such especially, I now address myself and ask: Have you fulfilled your obligations and pledges? Have you, who would fain lay all the blame on the Society and the Masters—the latter the embodiment of charity, tolerance, justice and universal love—have you led the life requisite, and the conditions required from one who becomes a candidate?

In. one thing only we have succeeded to be considered higher than our Christian Brothers, who, according to Lawrence Oliphant’s graphic expression “Kill one another for Brotherhood’s sake and fight as devils for the love of God”—and this is that we have made away with every dogma and “THE THEOSOP H ICAL MAHATMAS”  247 are now justly and wisely trying to make away with the last vestige of even nominal authority. But i n every other respect we are as bad as they are: backbiting, slander, uncharitableness, criticism, incessant war-cry and ding of mutual rebukes that Christian Hell itself might be proud of! And all this, I suppose, is the Masters’ fault: T HEY will help those who help o thers on the way of salvation and liberation from selfishness—with kicks and scandals? Truly we are an example to the world, and fit companions for the holy ascetics of the snowy Range! And now a few words more before I close. I will be asked: “And who are you to find fault with us? Are you, who claim nevertheless, communion with the Masters and receive daily favors from Them; Are you so holy, faultless, and so worthy?” To this I answer: I AM NOT . Imperfect a n d faulty is my nature; many and glaring are my shortcomings—and for this my Karma i s heavier than that of any other Theosophist. It is— and must be so––since for so many years I stand set in the pillory, a target for my enemies and some friends also. Yet I accept the trial cheerfully. Why? Because I know that I have, all my faults notwithstanding, Master’s protection extended over me. And if I have it, the reason for it is simply this: for thirty-five years and more, ever since 1851 that I saw my Master bodily and personally for the first time, I have never once denied or even doubted Him, not even in thought. Never a reproach or a murmur against Him has escaped my lips, or entered even my brain for one instant under the heaviest trials. From the first I knew what I had to expect, for I was told that, which I have never ceased repeating to others: as soon as one steps on the Path leading to the Ashrum of the blessed Masters—the last and only custodians of primitive Wisdom and Truth—his Karma, instead of having to be distributed throughout his long life, falls upon him in a block and crushes him with its whole weight.

He will not escape 248  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Karma just the same, but he will only lose that for which he has risked its untimely visits. This is why havi n g been so constantly, so mercilessly slashed by my Karma using my enemies as unconscious weapons, that I have stood it all. I felt sure that Master would not permit that I should perish; that he would always appear at the eleventh hour— and so he did. Three times I was saved from death by Him, the last time almost against my will; when I went again into the cold, wicked world out of love for Him, who has taught me what I know and made me what I am. Therefore, I do His work and bidding, and this is what has given me the lion’s strength to support shocks—physical and mental, one of which would have killed any theosophist who would go on doubting the mighty protection. Unswerving devotion to Him who embodies the duty traced for me, and belief in the Wisdom—collectively, of that grand, mysterious, yet actual Brotherhood of holy men—is my only merit and the cause of my success in Occult philosophy.

They are cyclic, like every other natural phenomenon, whether mental or cosmic, universal or national. Dam a river in one place, and the water will work its way into another, and break out through it like a torrent. One of such universal aspirations, the strongest perhaps in man’s nature, is the longing to seek for the unknown; an ineradicable desire to penetrate below the surface of things, a thirst for the knowledge of that which is hidden from others. Nine children out of ten will break their toys to see what there is inside. It is an innate feeling and is Protean in form. It rises from the ridiculous (or perhaps rather from the reprehensible) to the sublime, for it is limited to indiscreet inquisitiveness, prying into neighbour’s secrets, in the uneducated, and it expands in the cultured into that love for knowledge which ends in leading them to the summits of science, and fills the Academies and the Royal Institutions with learned men. But this pertains to the world of the objective. The man in whom the metaphysical element is stronger than the physical, is propelled by this natural aspiration towards the mystical, to that which the materialist is pleased to call a “superstitious belief in the supernatural.” The Church, while encouraging our aspirations after the holy—on strictly theological and orthodox lines, of course—condemns at the same time the human craving after the same, whenever the practical search after it departs from its own lines. The"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"memory of the thousands of illiterate “witches,” and the hundreds of learned alchemists, philosophers and other heretics, tortured, burnt, and otherwise put to death during the Middle Ages, remains as an ever-present witness to that arbitrary and despotic interference. In the present age both Church and Science, the blindly-believing and the all-denying, are arrayed against the Secret Sciences, though both Church and Science believed in and practised them—especially the Kabalah 252  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS —at a not very distant period of history. One says now, “It is of the devil!” the other that “the devil is a c reation of the Church, and a disgraceful superstition”; in short, that there is neither devil nor occult sciences. The first one forgets that it has publicly proclaimed, hardly 400 years ago, the Jewish Kabalah as the greatest witness to the truths of Christianity; * the second, that the most illustrious men of science were all alchemists, astrologers and magicians, witness Paracelsus, Van Helmont, Roger Bacon, etc. But consistency has never been a virtue of Modern Science. It has religiously believed in all which it now denies, and it has denied all that it now believes in, from the circulation of-the blood up to steam and electric power.

In 1486, when only twenty-four years old, he published “ nine hundred Theses, which were placarded in Rome [not without the consent or knowledge surely of the Pope and his Government?], and which he undertook to defend in the presence of all European scholars, whom he invited to the eternal city, promising to defray their travelling expenses. Among these Theses was the following, ‘ No science yields greater proof of the divinity of Christ than magic and the Kabbalah ’.” The reason why will be shown in the present article.

Anyone whose"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"natural mysticism impels him to seek for sympathetic contact with other minds, is astonished to find how large a number of persons are not only interested in Mysticism generally, but are actually themselves Kabalists. The river dammed during the Middle Ages has flowed since noiselessly underground, and has now burst up as an irrepressible torrent. Hundreds to-day study the Kabalah, where, scarcely one or two could I have been found some fifty years ago, when fear of the Church was still a powerful factor in men’s lives. But the long-pent-up torrent has now diverged into two streams—Eastern Occultism and the Jewish Kabalah; the traditions of the Wisdom-Religion of the races that preceded the Adam of the “Fall”; and the system of the ancient Levites of Israel, who most ingeniously veiled a portion of that religion of the Pantheists under the mask of monotheism. Unfortunately many are called but few chosen. The two systems threaten the world of the mystics with a speedy conflict, which, instead of increasing the spread of the One universal Truth, will necessarily only weaken and impede its progress. Yet, the question is not, once more, which is the one truth. For both are founded upon the eternal verities of prehistoric knowledge, as both, in the present age and the state of mental transition through which humanity is now passing, can give out only a certain portion of these verities. It is simply a question: “Which of the two systems contains most unadulterated facts: and, most important of all—which of the two presents its teachings in the most Catholic ( i.e., unsectarian) and impartial manner?” One—the Eastern system—has veiled for ages its profound pantheistic unitarianism with the exuberance of an exoteric polytheism; the other—as said above—with the screen of exoteric monotheism. Both are but masks to hide the sacred truth from the profane; for neither the Âryan nor the Semitic philosophers have ever accepted either 254  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS the anthropomorphism of the many Gods, or the personality of the one God, as a philosophica l proposition. But it is impossible within the limits we have at our disposal, to attempt to enter upon a minute discussion of this question. We must be content with a simpler task. The rites and ceremonies of the Jewish law seem to be an abyss, which long generations of Christian Fathers, and especially of Protestant Reformers have vainly sought to fill in with their far-fetched interpretations. Yet all the early Christians, Paul and the Gnostics, regarded and proclaimed the Jewish law as essentially distinct from the new Christian law. St. Paul called the former an allegory, and St. Stephen told the Jews an hour before being stoned that they had not even kept the law that they had received from the angels (the aeons), and as to the Holy Ghost (the impersonal Logos or Christos, as taught at Initiation) they had resisted and rejected it as their fathers had done ( Acts , vii). This was virtually telling them that their law was inferior to the later one. Notwithstanding that the Mosaic Books which we think we have in the Old Testament, cannot be more than two or three centuries older than Christianity, the Protestants have nevertheless made of them their Sacred Canon, on a par with, if not higher than, the Gospels. But when the Pentateuch was written, or rather rewritten after Ezdras, i.e., after the Rabbis had settled"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"upon a new departure, a number of additions were made which were taken bodily from Persian and Babylonian doctrines; and this at a period subsequent to the colonization of Judea under the authority of the kings of Persia. This re-editing was of course done in the same way as with all such Scriptures. They were originally written in a secret key, or cipher, known only to the Initiates. But instead of adapting the contents to the highest spiritual truths as taught in the third, the highest, degree of Initiation, and expressed in symbolical language—as may be seen even in the exoteric Purânas of India—the writers of the Pentateuch, revised and corrected, they who cared but for earthly and national glory, adapted only to astro-physiological symbols the supposed events KABALAH AND K ABALISTS  255 of the Abrahams, Jacobs, and Solomons, and the fantastic history of their little race. Thus they produced , u nder the mask of monotheism, a religion of sexual and phallic worship, one that concealed an adoration of the Gods, or the lower aeons. No one would maintain that anything like the dualism and the angelolatry of Persia, brought by the Jews from the captivity, could ever be found in the real Law, or Books of Moses. For how, in such case, could the Sadducees, who reverenced that law, reject angels, as well as the soul and its immortality? And yet angels, if not the soul’s immortal nature, are distinctly asserted to exist in the Old Testament, and are found in the Jewish modern scrolls.* This fact of the successive and widely differing redactions of that which we loosely term the Books of Moses, and of their triple adaptation to the first (lowest), second, and third, or highest, degree of Sodalian initiation, and that still more puzzling fact of the diametrically opposite beliefs of the Sadducees and the other Jewish sects, all accepting, nevertheless, the same Revelation— can be made comprehensible only in the light of our Esoteric explanation. It also shows the reason why, when Moses and the Prophets belonged to the Sodalities (the great Mysteries), the latter yet seem so often to fulminate against the abominations of the Sodales and their “Sod.” For had the Old Canon been translated literally, as is claimed, instead of being adapted to a monotheism absent from it, and to the spirit of each sect, as the differences in the Septuagint and Vulgate prove, the following contradictory sentences would be added to the hundreds of other inconsistencies in “Holy Writ.” “ Sod Ihoh [the mysteries of Johoh, or Jehovah] are for those who fear him,” says Psalm , xxv, 14, mistranslated “the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him.” Again “Al [El] is terrible in –––––––––– * This is just w hat the Gnostics had always maintained quite independently of Christians.

The title of Kadeshim (Kadosh, sing.) means in reality something quite different from saints though it is generally explained as “priests,” the “holy” and the “ Initiated ”; for the Kadeshim were simply the galli of the abominable mysteries (Sod) of the exoteric rites. They were, in short, the male Nautches of the temples, during whose initiations the arcanum, the Sod (from which “Sodom,” perchance) of physiological and sexual evolution, were divulged. These rites all belonged to the first degree of the Mysteries, so protected and beloved by David—the “friend of God.” They must have been very ancient with the Jews, and were ever abominated by the true Initiates; thus we find the dying Jacob’s prayer is that his soul should not come into the secret ( Sod, in the original) of Simeon and Levi (the priestly caste) and into their assembly during which they “slew a man” ( Genesis, xlix, 5, 6).* And yet Moses is claimed by the Kabalists as chief of the Sodales! Reject the explanation of the Secret Doctrine and the whole Pentateuch becomes the abomination of abominations. Therefore, do we find Jehovah, the anthropomorphic God, everywhere in the Bible, but of A IN SUPH not one word is said. And therefore, also, was the Jewish metrology quite d i f f e r e n t f r o m the numeral methods of other people.

One instance will suffice. Whence the dual meaning of the First-born, the Lamb, the Unborn, and the Eternal—all relating to the Logos or Christos? We say from the Sanskrit Aja , a word the meanings of which are: ( a ) the Ram, or the Lamb, the first sign of the Zodiac, called in astronomy Mesha ; ( b ) the Unborn, a title of the first Logos, or Brahma, the self-existent cause of all, described and so referred to in the Upanishads. The Hebrew Kabalistic Gematria, Notaricon, and T’mura are very ingenious methods, giving the key to the secret meaning of Jewish symbology, one that applied the relations of their sacred imagery only to one side of Nature—namely, the physical side. Their myths and the names and the events attributed to their Biblical personages were made to correspond with astronomical revolutions and sexual evolution, and had nought to do with the spiritual states of man; hence no such correspondences are to be found in the reading of their sacred canon. The real Mosaic Jews of the Sodales, whose direct heirs on the line of initiation were the Sadducees, had no spirituality in them, nor did they feel any need for it apparently. The reader, whose ideas of Initiation and Adeptship are intimately blended with the mysteries of the after-life and soul survival, will now see the reason for the great yet natural inconsistencies found on almost –––––––––– * [J.

Thus, in the Book of Job, a Kabalistic treatise on Egypto-Arabic Initiation, th e symbolism of which conceals the highest spiritual mysteries, one finds yet this significant and purely materialistic verse: “Man that is born of a woman is . . . . . . . . like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not” (xiv, 1, 2)."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"But Job speaks here of the personality, and he is right; for no Initiate would say that the personality long survived the death of the physical body; the spirit alone is immortal. But this sentence in Job, the oldest document in the Bible, makes only the more brutally materialistic that in Ecclesiastes , iii, 19, et seq., one of the latest records. The writer, who speaks in the name of Solomon, and says that “that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even . . . as the one dieth, so dieth the other . . . so that a man hath no preeminence over a beast,” is quite on a par with the modern Haeckels, and expresses only that which he thinks. Therefore, no knowledge of Kabalistic methods can help one in finding that in the Old Testament which has never been there since the Book of the Law was rewritten (rather than found) by Hilkiah. Nor can the reading of the Egyptian symbols be much helped by the mediæval Kabalistic systems. Indeed, it is but the blindness of a pious illusion that can lead anyone to discover any spiritual and metaphysical correspondences or meaning in the Jewish purely astro-physiological symbology. On the other hand, the ancient pagan religious systems, so-called, are all built upon abstract spiritual speculations, their gross external forms being, perhaps, the most secure veil to hide their inner meaning. It can be demonstrated, on the authority of the most learned Kabalists of our day that the Zohar, and almost all the Kabalistic works, have passed through Christian hands. Hence, that they cannot be considered any longer as universal, but have become simply sectarian. This is well shown by Pico della Mirandola’s thesis upon the proposition that “no Science yields greater proof of KABALAH AND K ABALISTS  259 the divinity of Christ than magic and the Kabalah.” This is true of the divinity of the Logos, or of the C hristos of the Gnostics; because that Christos remains the same W ORD of the ever-unman ifested Deity, whether we call it Parabrahm or Ain Suph—by whatever name he himself is called—Krishna, Buddha, or Ormazd. But this Christos is neither the Christ of the Churches, nor yet the Jesus of the Gospels; it is only an impersonal Principle. Nevertheless the Latin Church made capital of this thesis; the result of which was, that as in the last century, so it is now in Europe and America. Almost every Kabalist is now a believer in a personal God, in the very teeth of the original impersonal Ain Suph, and is, moreover, a more or less heterodox, but still, a Christian. This is due entirely to the ignorance of most people ( a ) that the Kabalah (the Zohar especially) we have, is not the original Book of Splendour, written down from the oral teachings of Shimon Ben Yochai; and (b) that the latter, being indeed an exposition of the hidden sense of the writings of Moses (so-called) was as equally good an exponent of the Esoteric meaning contained under the shell of the literal sense in the Scriptures of any Pagan religion. Nor do the modern Kabalists seem to be aware of the fact, that the Kabalah as it now stands, with its more than revised texts, its additions made to apply to the New as much as to the Old Testament, its numerical language recomposed so as to apply to both, and its crafty veiling,"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"is no longer able now to furnish all the ancient and primitive meanings. In short that no Kabalistic work now extant among the Western nations can display any greater mysteries of nature, than those which Ezra and Co., and the later co-workers of Moses de Leon, desired to unfold; the Kabalah contains no more than the Syrian and Chaldean Christians and ex-Gnostics of the thirteenth century wanted those works to reveal. And what they do reveal hardly repays the trouble of passing one’s life in studying it. For if they may, and do, present a field of immense interest to the Mason and mathematician, they can teach scarcely anything to the student hungering after spiritual mysteries. 260  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS The use of all the seven keys to unlock the mysteries of Being in this life, and the lives to come, as in those which have gone by, show that the Chaldean Book of Numbers, and the Upanishads undeniably conceal the most divine philosophy—as it is that of the Universal Wisdom Religion. But the Zohar, now so mutilated, can show nothing of the kind. Besides which, who of the Western philosophers or students has all those keys at his command? These are now entrusted only to the highest Initiates in Gupta-Vidyâ, to great Adepts; and, surely it is no self-taught tyro, not even an isolated mystic, however great his genius and natural powers, who can hope to unravel in one life more than one or two of the lost keys.* The key to the Jewish metrology has been undeniably unravelled, and a very important key it is. But as we may infer from the words of the discoverer himself in the footnote just quoted—though that key (concealed in the “Sacred Metrology”) discloses the fact that “Holy Writ” contains “ a rational science of sober and great worth ,” yet it helps to unveil no higher spiritual truth than that –––––––––– * T h e w r ite r in the Masonic Review is thus quite justified in saying as he does, that “the Cabalistic field is that in which astrologers, necromancers, black and white magicians, fortune tellers, chiromancers, and all the like, revel and make claims to supernaturalism ad nauseam ”; and he adds: “The Christian, quarrying into its mass of mysticism, claims for it support and authority for that most perplexing of all problems, the Holy Trinity, and the portrayed character of Christ . . . With equal assurance, but more effrontery, the knave, in the name of Cabbalah, will sell amulets and charms, tell fortunes, draw horoscopes, and just as readily give specific rules . . . . for raising the dead, and actually—the devil . . . . . Discovery has yet to be made of what Cabbalah really consists, before any weight or authority can be given to the name. On that discovery will rest the question whether the name should be received as related to matters worthy of rational acknowledgment.” “ The writer claims that such a discovery has been made, and that the same embraces rational science of sober and great worth.” “The Cabbalah,” from the Masonic Review for September, 1885, pp. 65-66, by Brother J.

By the showing of the said discoverer himself, “the burden of this secret doctrine, this Cabbalah, is of pure truth and right reason, for it is geometry with applied proper numbers, of astronomy and of a system of measure, viz ., the Masonic inch, the twenty-four inch gauge (or the double foot), the yard, and the mile. These were claimed to be of divine revelation and impartation, by the possession and use of which, it could be said of Abram: ‘Blessed of the Most High God, Abram, measure of heaven and earth’”—the “ creative law of measure .” And is this all that the primitive Kabalah contained? No; for the author remarks elsewhere: “What the originally and intended right reading was [in the Pentateuch ] who can tell?” [ Ibid ., p. 68.] Thus allowing the reader to infer that the meanings implied in the exoteric, or dead letter of the Hebrew texts, are by no means only those revealed by metrology. Therefore we are justified in saying that the Jewish Kabalah, with its numerical methods, is now only one of the keys to the ancient mysteries, and that the Eastern or Âryan system alone can supply the rest, and unveil the whole truth of Creation.* –––––––––– * E v e n a s it s ta nds now, the Kabalah, with its several methods, can only puzzle by offering several versions; it can never divulge the whole truth. The readings of even the first sentence of Genesis are several. To quote the author: “It is made to be read ‘B’rashith bârâ Elohim,’ etc., ‘In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth;’ wherein Elohim is a plural nominative to a verb in the third person singular. Nachmanides called attention to the fact that the text might suffer the reading, ‘B’rash ithbârâ Elohim,’ etc., ‘In the head (source or beginning) created itself (or developed) Gods, the heavens and the earth ,’ really a more grammatical rendering.” [ Ibid. , p. 68.] And yet we are forced to believe the Jewish monotheism! –––––––––– 262  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS What this numeral system is, we leave its discoverer to explain himself. According to him: Like all othe r human productions of the kind, the Hebrew text of the Bible was in characters which could serve as soun d signs for syllabic utterance, or for this purpose what are called letters. Now in the first place, these original character signs were also pictures, each one of them; and these pictures of themselves stood for ideas which could be communicated,—much like the original Chinese letters. Gustav Seyffarth shows that the Egyptian hieroglyphics numbered over six hundred picture characters, which embraced the modified use, syllabically, of the original number of letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The characters of the Hebrew text of the Sacred Scroll were divided into classes, in which the characters of each class were interchangeable; whereby one form might be exchanged for another to carry a modified signification, both by letter, and picture and number. Seyffarth shows the modified form of the very ancient Hebrew alphabet in the old Coptic by this law of interchange of characters.* This law of permitted interchange of letters is to be found quite fully set forth in the Hebrew dictionaries . . . Though recognized . . . it is very perplexing and hard to understand, because we have lost the specific use and power of such interchange. [Just so!] In the second place, these characters stood for numbers— to be used for numbers as we use specific number signs —though, also, there is very much to prove that the old Hebrews were in possession of the so-called Arabic numerals, as"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"we have them, from the straight line 1 to the zero characters, together making 1+9=10. . . . . . In the third place, it is said, and it seems to be proven, that these characters stood for musical notes; so that for instance, the arrangement of the letters in the first chapter of Genesis , can be rendered musically, or by song.† Another law of the Hebrew characters was that only the consonantal signs were characterized—the vowels were not characterized, but were supplied. If one will try it he will find that a consonant of itself cannot be made vocal without the help of a vowel;‡ therefore . . . . the consonants made –––––––––– * Before Seyffarth can hope to have his hypothesis accepted, however, he will have to prove that ( a ) the Israelites had an alphabet of their own when the ancient Egyptians or Copts had as yet none; and ( b ) that the Hebrew of the later scrolls is the Hebrew, or “mystery language” of Moses, which the Secret Doctrine denies. [H. P. B.] † Not the Hebrew helped by the Masoretic signs, at all events. See further on, however. [H.P.B.] ‡ And therefore as the vowels were furnished ad libitum by the Masorets they could make of a word what they liked! [H.P.B.] –––––––––– KABALAH AND KABALISTS  263 the framework of a word, but to give it life or utterance into the air, so as to impart the thought of the mind, and the feeling of the heart, the vowels had to be supplied.* Now, even if we suppose, for argument’s sake, that the “framework,” i.e., the consonants of t he Pentateuch are the same as in the days of Moses, what changes must have been effected with those scrolls—written in such a poor language as the Hebrew, with its less than two dozens of letters—when re-written time after time, and its vowels and points supplied in ever-new combinations! No two minds are alike, and the feelings of the heart change. What could remain, we ask, of the original writings of Moses, if such ever existed, when they had been lost for nearly 800 years and then found when every remembrance of them must have disappeared from the minds of the most learned, and Hilkiah has them re-written by Shaphan, the scribe? When lost again, they are re-written again by Ezra; lost once more in 168 B.C. the volume or scrolls were again destroyed; and when finally they reappear, we find them dressed in their Masoretic disguise! We may know something of Ben Chajim,† who published the Masorah of the scrolls in the fifteenth century; we can know nothing of Moses, this is certain, unless we become—Initiates of the Eastern School . Ahrens, when speaking of the letters so arranged in the Hebrew sacred scrolls—that they were of th e mselves musical notes—had probably never studied Âryan Hindû music. In the Sanskrit language there is no need to so arrange letters in the sacred ollas that they should become musical. For the whole Sanskrit alphabet and the Vedas, from the first word to the last, are musical notations reduced to writing, and the two are inseparable.‡ As –––––––––– * [Ibid., Mason ic Review, September, 1885, p. 67.] † [ Vide Bio-bliogr.

How far do they succeed and where is the evidence of their success? Read all the volumes published on the Kabalah in the course of this century; and if we except a few volumes issued recently in America, it will be found that not a single Kabalist has penetrated even skin deep below the surface of that “first face.” Their digests are pure speculation and hypotheses and—no more. One bases his glosses upon Ragon’s Masonic revelations; another takes Fabre d’Olivet† for his prophet—this writer having never been a Kabalist, though he was a genius of wonderful, almost miraculous, erudition, and a polyglot linguist greater than whom there was since his day none, even among the philologists of the French Academy, which refused to take notice of his work. Others, again, believe that no greater Kabalist was born among the sons of men than the late Éliphas Lévi—a charming and witty writer, who, however, has more mystified than taught in his many volumes on Magic.

But there are those who are pledged to no secrecy. Those writers are the only ones on whose information the Kabalists ought to rely, however incomplete their statements from the standpoint of a full revelation, i.e., of the sevenfold Esoteric meaning. It is they who care least for those secrets after which alone the modern Hermetist and Kabalist is now hungering such as the transmutation into gold, and the Elixir of Life, or the Philosopher’s Stone–– for physical purposes. For all the chief secrets of the Occult teachings are concerned with the highest spiritual knowledge. They deal with mental states, not with physical processes and their transformations. In a word, the real, genuine Kabalah, the only original copy of which is contained in the Chaldean Book of Numbers, pertains to, and teaches about, the realm of spirit, not that of matter. What, then, is the Kabalah, in reality, and does it afford a revelation of such higher spiritual mysteries? The writer answers most emphatically NO . What the Kabalistic keys and methods we r e, in the origin of the Pentateuch and other sacred scrolls and documents of the Jews now no longer extant, is one thing; what they are now is quite another. The Kabalah is a manifold language; moreover, one whose reading is determined by the dead-letter face text of the record to be deciphered. It teaches and helps one to read the Esoteric real meaning hidden under the mask of that dead letter; it cannot create a text or make one find in the document under study that which has never been in it from the beginning. The Kabalah—such as we have it now—is inseparable from the text of the Old Testament, as remodelled by Ezra and others. And as the Hebrew Scriptures, or their contents, have been repeatedly altered—notwithstanding the ancient boast that not one letter in the Sacred Scroll, not an iota, has ever been changed—so no Kabalistic methods can help us by reading in it anything besides what there is in it. He who does it is no Kabalist, but a dreamer. 268  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Lastly, the profane reader should learn the difference between the Kabalah and the"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Kabalistic works, before he is made to face other arguments. For the Kabalah is no special volume, nor is it even a system. It consists of seven different systems applied to seven different interpretations of any given Esoteric work or subject. These systems were always transmitted orally by one generation of Initiates to another, under the pledge of the Sodalian oath, and they have never been recorded in writing by any one. Those who speak of translating the Kabalah into this or another tongue may as well talk of translating the wordless signal-chants of the Bedouin brigands into some particular language. Kabalah, as a word, is derived from the root Kbl ( Kebel ) “to hand over,” or “to receive” orally. It is erroneous to say, as Kenneth Mackenzie does in his Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia [p. 399], that “ the doctrine of the Kabbalah refers to the system handed down by oral transmission, and is nearly allied to . . . . tradition ”; for in this sentence the first proposition only is true, while the second is not. It is not allied to “tradition” but to the seven veils or the seven truths orally revealed at Initiation. Of these methods, pertaining to the universal pictorial languages—meaning by “pictorial” any cipher, number, symbol, or other glyph that can be represented, whether objectively or subjectively (mentally)—three only exist at present in the Jewish system.* Thus, if Kabalah as a word is Hebrew, the system itself is no more Jewish than is sunlight; it is universal. On the other hand, the Jews can claim the Zohar, Sepher Yetzirah (Book of Creation), Sepher Dzeniuta, and a few others, as their own undeniable property and as Kabalistic works.

As the subject is a very vast one, only essential data have been included. The Zohar, known also as the Midrash ha-Zohar and Sepher ha-Zohar, meaning “Splendour,” is the great storehouse of ancient Hebrew Theosophy, supplemented by the philosophical doctrines of mediaeval Jewish Rabbis. Together with the Sepher Yetzirah, or “Book of Formation,” one of the most ancient Kabbalistic works, the collection of the Zohar represents the oldest extant treatises on the Hebrew esoteric doctrines. It consists of several distinct but interrelated tracts, each discussing some special branch of the subject; each of these tracts consists again of several portions, and contains a kernel of ancient teachings, around which are clustered comments and explanations written by several hands and at very different epochs. There is considerable evidence to show that the kernel of these doctrines is of very remote antiquity, and embodies the remnants of one of the oldest systems of philosophy that have come down to us. Sufficient proof exists to"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"connect some of these tenets with the period of the return from the Babylonian captivity, as they bear the impress of the still more ancient Chaldaean secret lore. The Zohar is largely a mystical and allegorical commentary on the Pentateuch. Together with various Appendices that must have been added to the collection at some later time, it deals with a large number of subjects, such as Ain Soph, the Emanations, the Sephirôth, Adam Kadmon, the Revolution of Souls ( Gilgulîm ) , the use of numbers and letters, the casting of lots, good and evil, etc. The largest portion of this collection is written in one of the Aramaic dialects; other portions are in Hebrew; the presence of still other dialects adds greatly to the difficulties of an accurate translation. Tradition current among mediaeval Rabbis assigned the authorship of the Zohar to Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai, who lived in the reign of the Roman Emperor Titus, A.D . 70-80, and was one of the most imp o rtant Tannaïm in the post-Hadrianic period. He was born in Galilee, and died at Meron, near Safid, in Palestine, where his traditional tomb is shown. His principal teacher was Akiba, whose Academy at Bene-Berak he attended for a good many years. Ordained after Akiba’s death by Judah ben Baba, he escaped from Jerusalem during the violent struggle of the Jews with the Romans, and hid himself in a cave for thirteen years. It is here that Shimon ben Yohai, a profound Kabbalist already, was instructed, according to tradition, by the prophet Elias himself. In his turn, he taught his disciples, Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Abba, who committed to writing those traditional teachings of the earlier Tannaïm which in 270  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS later ages became known as the Zohar. After h i s seclusion, Shimon ben Yohai settled in Galilee and founded a school of his own, gaining the reputation of a wonder-worker. He was sent to Rome with Eleazar ben Jose, to obtain the repeal of imperial orders which had forbidden certain Jewish ceremonial observances, and returned after a successful mission. While the name of Shimon ben Yohai is associated with the history of the Zohar, it is nevertheless certain that a very large portion of this compilation is not older than approximately 1280, when it was edited in manuscript form by Moses ben Shem-Tob de Leon. The latter was a famous Kabbalistic writer born at Leon, Spain, about 1250, and who lived in Guadalajara, Valladolid and Avila, and died at Arevalo, in 1305. Familiar with the mediaeval mystical literature, he was especially conversant with the writings of Solomon ben Judah ibn Gabirol (Avicebron), Judah ha-Levi, and Maimonides. Apart from his work on the Zohar, he is known for other dissertations, among them the Ha-Nephesh ha-’hokhmah (Basel, 1608), which deals with the human soul as a likeness of its heavenly prototype, and with the transmigration of souls. He led a wandering life, and was a man of brilliant intellect and lofty religious idealism. It is most likely that Moses de Leon was the first one to produce the Zohar as a whole, but many of its constituent portions date from the time of Shimon ben Yohai and the Second Temple, even though historical evidence is not forthcoming of the many steps in the course of transmission of these doctrines from ante-Roman times. The Zohar in its present Hebrew form was first printed at Mantua (1558-60) and Cremona (1558); only one MSS. of it is in existence prior to the first edition; another edition appeared at Lublin, in 1623. Baron Christian Knorr von Rosenroth (1636-89), a very able and searching Hebrew scholar, translated several treatises of the Zohar into Latin, and published them, together with the Hebrew text under the title of Kabbalah Denudata (Vol. I, Sulzbach, 1677-78; Vol. II,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Frankfurt, 1684). C. Liddell MacGregor Mathers published under the title of The Kabbalah Unveiled (London: George Redway, 1887. 8vo., viii, 359 pp.) an English translation of three of these treatises: the Siphra di-Zeni’uta, or “Book of the Concealed Mystery,” the Idra Rabbah, or “Greater Holy Assembly,” and the Idra Zuta, or “Lesser Holy Assembly,” together with an original introduction on the subject. Other important treatises making part of the Zohar are: “The Hidden Midrash,” “The Mysteries of the Pentateuch,” “The Faithful Shepherd,” “The Secret of Secrets,” “Discourses of the Aged in Mishpatim,” “Yanuka, or the Child,” and the “Aesh Metzareph,” the latter dealing with alchemical ideas. Selected portions of the Zohar have been translated into French by Jean de Pauly, and published by Éliphas Lévi as Le Livre des KABALAH AND K ABALISTS  271 Splendeurs (Paris, 1894); and into English by Harry Sperling and M.

Waite, The Doctrine and Literature of the Kabalah, London, 1902; and Secret Doctrine in Israel, London, 1913. As to the Sepher Yetzirah, or “Book of Formation,’ it is reputed to be the oldest known Kabbalistic work, attributed by tradition to Abraham himself, as also to Akiba. It deals with permutations of numbers and letters, and is our first source for the doctrine of emanations and the sephirôth. It is written in the Neo-Hebraic of the Mishnab, and is unquestionably of very ancient orgin. The editio princeps is that of Mantua, 1562, with several subsequent ones.

Only that truth, being for the few, escapes the majority. To FRAGMENTS   273 the pious profane, the veil recovers a celestial locality thickly peopled with divine beings, dwarfs and gia n ts, good and wicked powers, all of whom are no better than human caricatures. Yet, while for the great majority the space behind the veil is really impenetrable—if it would but confess the real state of its mind—those, endowed with the “third eye” (the eye of Siva), discern in the Cimmerian darkness and chaos a light in whose intense radiance all shape born of human conception disappears, leaving the all-informing divine P RESENCE , to be felt—not seen; sensed— never express e d. A charming allegory translated from an old Sanskrit manuscript illustrates this idea admirably: Toward the close of the Pralaya (the intermediate period between two “creations” or evolutions of our phenomenal universe), the great I T , the One that rests in infinity and ever is , dropped its r e flection, which expanded in limitless Space, and felt a desire to make itself cognizable by the creatures evolved from its shadow.

But when they looked up to the place where stood the palace, whose one corner stretched into the right, and the other into the left infinitude—the little men saw nothing; the palace was mistaken by them for empty space, and being so vast remained invisible to their eyes. Then the Mahârâja resorted to another expedient. He determined to manifest himself to the little creatures whom he pitied— not as a whole but only in his parts. He destroyed the palace built by him from his manifesting qualities, brick by brick, and began throwing the bricks down upon the earth one after the other.

One of these, Laghima(n) or “the faculty of assuming levity,” is illustrated in a Purâna as rising and descending along a sunbeam to the solar orb with its mysteries; e.g., Khatvânga, in Vishnu-Purâna (Book IV, ch. iv). “It must be equally easy to the adept to travel a ray downwards,” remarks Fitzedward Hall –––––––––– * In every an c ient cosmography the universe and the earth are divided into seven parts or regions. –––––––––– FRAGMENTS   275 (p. 311).* And why not, if the action is understood in its right and correct sense?

To this day the High Lamas cut off during public consecrations a lock of the hair of the candidates for the religious life, repeating a formula to the effect that the six others will follow, when the “upâsaka” IS READY .

Some are even now awaking into existence; and it is probable that worlds are beginning and ending continually. Hence cosmic existence, like the kingdoms of organic life, presents a simultaneous panorama of a completed cycle of being. A taxonomic arrangement of the various grades of animal existence presents a succession of forms which we find repeated in the embryonic history of a single individual, and again in the succession of geological types; so the taxonomy of the heavens is both a cosmic embryology and a cosmic palaeontology.* So much for cycles again in modern orthodox science.

The division is rather crit i cized, and the grouping hitherto adopted and favoured in theosophical teachings is resolved into one of Four. This criticism has already given rise to some misunderstanding, and it is argued by some that a slur is thrown on the original teachings. This apparent disagreement with one whose views are rightly held as almost decisive on occult matters in our Society is certainly a dangerous handle to give to opponents who are ever on the alert to detect and blazon forth contradictions and inconsistencies in our philosophy. Hence I feel it my duty to show that there is in reality no inconsistency between Mr. Subba Row’s views and our own in the question of the septenary division; and to show, ( a ) that the lecturer was perfectly well acquainted with the septenary division before he joined the Theosophical Society; ( b ) that he knew it was the teaching of old Aryan “philosophers [who] have associated seven occult powers with the seven principles” in the Macrocosm and the Microcosm (see the end of this article); and ( c ) that from the beginning he had objected—not to the classification but to the form in which it was expressed. Therefore, now, when he calls the division “unscientific and misleading,” and adds that “this sevenfold classification is almost conspicuous by its absence in many [not all ?] of our Hindu books,” etc., and that it is better to adopt the time-honoured classification of four"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"principles, Mr. Subba Row must mean only some special orthodox books, as it would be impossible for him to contradict himself in such a conspicuous way. A few words of explanation, therefore, will not be altogether out of place. For the matter of being “conspicuous by its absence” in Hindu books, the said classification is as conspicuous by its absence in Buddhist books. This, for a reason transparently clear: it was always esoteric; and as such, rather inferred than openly taught. That it is “misleading” is also perfectly true; for the great feature of the day—materialism—has led the minds of our Western theosophists into the 286  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS prevalent habit of viewing the seven principles as distinct and self existing entities, instead of what they are — namely, upadhis and correlating states—three upadhis, basic groups, and four principles. As to being “unscientific,” the term can be only attributed to a lapsus linguae, and in this relation let me quote what Mr. Subba Row wrote about a year before he joined the Theosophical Society in one of his ablest articles, “Brahmanism on the Sevenfold Principle in Man,” the best review that ever appeared of the “Fragments of Occult Truth”—since embodied in Esoteric Buddhism. Says the author:— I have carefully examined it [the teaching], and find that the results arrived at (in the Buddhist doctrine) do not seem to d iffer much from the conclusions of our Aryan philosophy, though our mode of stating the arguments may differ in form. Having enumerated after this the “three primary causes” which bring the human being into existence— i.e., P arabrahman, Ś akti and Prakriti—he explains: No w, according to the adepts of ancient Aryavarta, seven principles a re evolved out of these three primary entities. Algebra teaches us that the number of combinations of n things taken one at a time, two at a time, three at a time, and so forth=2n—1. Applying this formula to the present case, the number of entities evolved from different combinations of these three primary causes amounts to 23 – 1=8 – 1=7. As a general rule, whenever seven entities are mentioned in the ancient occult sciences of India, in any connection whatsoever, you must suppose that those seven entities came into existence from three primary entities; and that these three entities again are evolved out of a single entity or MONAD.

The reader is referred, moreover, to the earlier pages of the above-mentioned article, in which it is stated that . . . . . the knowledge of the occult powe r s of nature possessed by the inhabitants of the lost Atlantis was learnt by the ancient adepts of India and was appended by them to the esoteric doctrine taught by the residents of the sacred Island [now the Gobi desert]*.

But this difference between the two doctrines does not include the septenary division, as it was universal a fter it had originated with the Atlanteans, who, as the Fourth Race, were of course an earlier race than the Fifth—the Aryan. Thus, from the purely metaphysical standpoint, the remarks made on the Septenary Division in the “ Bhagavad-Gita ” Lecture hold good to-day, as they did five or six years ago in the article “Brahmanism on the Sevenfold Principle in Man,” their apparent discrepancy notwithstanding. For purposes of purely theoretical esotericism, they are as valid in Buddhist as they are in Brahmanical philosophy. Therefore, when Mr. Subba Row proposes to hold to “the time-honoured classification of four principles” in a lecture on a Vedanta work—the Vedantic classification, however, dividing man into “ five kosas ” (sheaths) and the Atma (the six nominally of course),† he simply shows thereby that he desires to remain strictly within theoretical and metaphysical, and –––––––––– * See Isis Unv e iled, Vol. I, p. 600, and the appendices by the Editor [H.P.B.] to the above-quoted article in Five Years of Theosophy. † This is the division given to us by Mr. Subba Row.

It is perhaps “misleading”—that is admitted; but surely it cannot be called “unscientific.” I will even permit myself to call that adjective a thoughtless expression, since it has been shown to be on the contrary very “scientific” by Mr. Subba Row himself; and quite"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"mathematically so, as the afore-quoted algebraic demonstration of the same proves it. I say that the division is due to nature herself pointing out its necessity in kosmos and man; just because the number seven is “a power, and a spiritual force” in its combination of three and four , of the triangle and the quaternary. It is no doubt far more convenient to adhere to the fourfold classification in a metaphysical and synthetical sense, just as I have adhered to the threefold classification—of body, soul and spirit—in Isis Unveiled, because had I then adopted the septenary division, as I have been compelled to do later on for purposes of strict analysis, no one would have understood it, and the multiplication of principles, instead of throwing light upon the subject, would have introduced endless confusion. But now the question has changed, and the position is different. We have unfortunately— for it was premature—opened a chink in the Chinese wall of esotericism, and we cannot now close it again, even if we would.

For it is simply a convenient division which prevents in no wise the recognition of but three groups—which Mr. Subba Row calls “four principles associated with four upadhis, which are further associated in their turn with four distinct states of consciousness.”* This is the Bhagavad-Gita classification, it appears; but not that of the Vedanta, nor—what the Raja-Yogis of the pre -Aryasangha schools and of the Mahayana system held to, and still hold beyond the Himalayas, and their system is almost identical with the Taraka Raja-Yoga— the difference between the latter and the Vedanta classification having been pointed out to us by Mr. Subba Row in his little article on the “Septenary Division in Different Indian Systems.” The Taraka Raja-Yogis recognize only three upadhis in which Atma may work, which, in India, if I mistake not, are the Jagrata , or waking state of consciousness (corresponding to the Sthulopadhi ); the Svapna, or dreaming state (in Sukshmopadhi), and the Sushupti, or causal state, produced by, and through Karanopadhi, or what we call Buddhi.

And here lies the real key to the septenary division of man, the three p r inciples coming in as an addition only during his life. As in the Macrocosm, so in the Microcosm; analogies hold good throughout nature. Thus the universe, our solar system, our earth down to man, are to be regarded as all equally possessing a septenary constitution— four superterrestrial and superhuman, so to say; three objective and astral. In dealing with the special case of man, only, there are two standpoints from which the question may be considered. Man in incarnation is certainly made up of seven principles, if we so term the seven states of his material, astral, and spiritual framework, which are all on different planes. But if we classify the principles according to the seat of the four degrees of consciousness, these upadhis may be reduced to four groups.* Thus his consciousness, never being centred in the second or third principles—both of which are composed of states of matter (or rather of “substance”) on different planes, each corresponding to one of the planes and principles in Kosmos—is necessary to form links between the first, fourth, and fifth principles, as well as subserving certain vital and psychic phenomena. These latter may be conveniently classified with the physical body under one head, and laid aside during trance ( Samadhi ) , as after death, thus leaving only the traditional exoteric and metaphysical four .

The rings obtained, whether in Newton’s soap-bubble, or in the crystal through the po l arizer, will exhibit invariably six or seven rings—a black spot surrounded by six rings, or a circle with a plane cube inside, circumscribed with six distinct rings, the circle itself the seventh. The “Norremberg” polarizing apparatus throws into objectivity almost all our occult geometrical symbols, though physicists are none the wiser for it. (See Newton’s and Tyndall’s experiments.)* The number seven is at the very root of occult Cosmogony and Anthropogony. No symbol to express evolution from its starting to its completion points would be possible without it. For the circle produces the point; the point expands into a triangle, returning after two angles upon itself, and then forms the mystical Tetraktis— the plane cube; which three when passing into the manifested world of effects, differentiated nature, become geometrically and numerically 3 + 4 = 7.

Parker.† Moreover, that the system from whence all these developments were derived “was anciently considered to be one resting in nature (or God), as the basis or law of the exertions practically of creative design”; and that it also underlies the Biblical structures, being found in the measurements given for Solomon’s temple, the ark of the Covenant, Noah’s Ark, etc., etc.,—in all the symbolical myths, in short, of the Bible. And what are the figures, the measure in which the sacred Cubit is derived from the esoteric Quadrature, which the Initiates know to have been contained in the Tetraktis of Pythagoras? Why, it is the universal primordial symbol. The figures found in the Ansated Cross of Egypt, as (I maintain) in the Indian Swastika, “the sacred sign” which embellishes the thousand heads of ∠ esha, the Serpent-cycle of eternity, on which rests Vishnu, the deity in Infinitude; and which also may be pointed out in the threefold ( treta ) fire of Puraravas, the first fire in the present Manvantara, out of the forty-nine (7 x 7) mystic fires.

He applies his ke y , so far, only to the esoteric language and the symbology in the Bible, and the Books of Moses especially. The great error of the able author, in my opinion, is, that he applies the key discovered by him chiefly to post-Atlantean and quasi-historical phallic elements in the world religions; feeling, intuitionally, a nobler, a higher, a more transcendental meaning in all this— only in the Bible—and a mere sexual worship in all other religions. This phallic element, however, in the older pagan worship related, in truth, to the physiological evolution of the human races, something that could not be discovered in the Bible, as it is absent from it (the Pentateuch being the latest of all the old Scriptures). Nevertheless, what the learned author has discovered and proved mathematically, is wonderful enough, and sufficient to make our claim good: namely, that the figures and 3+4= 7, are at the very basis, and are the soul of cosmogony and the evolution of mankind. To whosoever desires to display this process by way of symbol, says the author speaking of the ansated cross, the Tau of the Egyptians and the Christian cross— . . . . . it would be by the figure of the cube unfolded, in connection with the circle, whose measure is taken off onto the edges of the cube .

It is very observable that, while there are but 6 faces to a cube, the representation of the cross as the cube unfolded as to the cross-bars, displays one face of the cube as common to two bars, counted as belonging to either; then, while the faces originally represented are but 6, the use of the two bars counts the square as 4 for the upright and 3 for the cross-bar, making 7 in all.

It is quite true that the three upadhis of the Taraka Raja-Yoga are, as Mr. Subba Row explains in his little article, “Septenary Division in Different Indian Systems,” “the best and simplest”—but only in purely contemplative Yoga. And he adds: . . . . . Though there are seven principles in man, there are but three distinct Upadhis (bases), in each of which his Atma may work independently of the rest. These three Upadhis can be separated by an adept without killing himself.

But this again holds good only with regard to his lower three principles—th e body and its (in life) inseparable prana and linga sarira. The rest can be separated, as they constitute no vital, but rather a mental and spiritual necessity. As to the remark in the same article objecting to the fourth principle being “included in the third ko \u0001 a (sheath), as the said principle is but the vehicle of will-power, which is but an energy of the mi n d,” I answer: Just so. But as the higher attributes of the fifth ( Manas ) , go to make up the original triad, and it is just the terrestrial energies, feelings and volitions which remain in the Kama loka, what is the vehicle, the astral form to carry them about as bhoota until they fade out—which they take centuries to accomplish? Can the “false” personality, or the piśacha , whose ego is made up precisely of all those terrestrial p as sions and fe e lings, remain in Kamaloka, and occasionally appear, without a substantial vehicle, however ethereal? Or are we to give up the seven principles, and the belief that there is such a thing as an astral body, and a bhoot, or spook? Most decidedly not. For Mr. Subba Row himself once more explains how, from the Hindu standpoint, the lower fifth, or Manas, can reappear after death, remarking very justly, that “it is absurd to call it a disembodied spirit. ” As he says: . . . . . It is merely a power or force retaining the impressions of the thoughts or ideas of the individual into whose compo s ition it originally entered [italics H. P. B.’s].

With her kidneys badly infected, she was unconscious for hours at a time. Countess C. Wachtmeister, who was living with H.P.B. at the time, summoned Mrs. Marie Gebhard from Elberfeld and Doctor Ashton Ellis of the London Lodge. A consultation between the latter and H.P.B.’s attending Belgian physician revealed very little hope of recovery. It was decided that H.P.B. would make her Will and that it would be signed in the presence of the two doctors, a lawyer, and the American consul. Before this plan could be carried out, and apparently during the night following upon this decision, H.P.B. was restored to relative health by her Master who had come that night and healed her. She had been given a choice between dying and living to finish The Secret Doctrine. She was shown the difficulties and sufferings she would have to go through in England where she was supposed to go. She chose to remain at her post and continue her work. The next day, the Will was made and signed as planned. For a while, this Will must have been in the hands of H.P.B.’s lawyer at Ostende. After H.P.B.’s passing, May 8,1891, Countess C. Wachtmeister saw the lawyer and was told that at one time he had given the Will back to H.P.B. She must have destroyed it at the time, as it was never found among her papers. Another Will drawn up later took its place (Vide C. Wachtmeister, Reminiscences, PP. 71-75). It is quite probable that it was at this time that H.P.B. had someone write out on an ordinary piece of letter-paper her directives as to the removal of her body after death.

P. Blavatsky to A. P. Sinnett, pp. 226-229): “You are wrong in attributing to my neglect the review of your United. It is there two-thirds done ever since you went away but I wanted to do it well, or leave it alone. Two pages were dictated to me— the rest left to my own brilliant pen. Hence it clashes like a star with a rush-light. I am on it again however and this time will finish it . . .”] Months have passed since the publication of this remarkable work—remarkable as a psychic produ c tion besides its undeniable literary worth—and we have been watching all the time to see the effects produced by it on the Philistine press. The latter forgetting but too often “that it is not the eye for faults, but beauties, that constitutes the true critic,” has made us acquainted for years with the spirit with which it generally treats theosophical works. There are not a few reviewers in the Metropolis of England—pre-eminent among these the literary critics of the Saturday Review, who love to proceed in the spirit so sternly denounced by Macculloch. “Fastidiousness, the discernment of defects and the propensity to seek them, in natural beauty, are not the proofs of taste, but the evidence of its absence,” he says. And adds: “it is worse than that, since it is a depravity, when pleasure is found in the discovery of such defects, real or imaginary.” When no defects can be ferreted out in unpopular works, the press boycotts them in contemptuous silence. It came to pass as it was expected. Unable to tear the mystic romance to shreds, to find fault with its style, or even to criticize the subject, as its author had wisely screened it behind the privileges of a fancy novel—the Philistines simply ignored it. There appeared two or three short notices in the leading papers in which, with U N I T E D   307 one or two exceptions, chaff—not always witty—was made to stand for a literary notice, and then the pr e ss subsided into silence. The novel was seriously mystical, the descriptive portions of the various phases of psychic phenomena were photographed from nature, and it was written by an earnest and a well-known Theosophist. This was, of course, amply sufficient to place the work on the Index Expurgatorius. The Graphic alone had a few"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"words of appreciation in its columns. As the present notice lays no claim to an analysis of the literary merits of United, but means to treat only of the psychic element in it—it may be worth our while to remind the reader of what was said of this novel in one, at least, of the best London papers. Mr. Sinnett’s new contribution to the literature of transcendental psychology, United , is more tha n a worthy successor to Karma. Adepts and disciples will, no doubt, apply to this work as to its predecessor, in order to find freshly suggestive light thrown on the doctrine it illustrates and seeks to popularize. But the ordinary reader is by no means forgotten—quite the contrary: and it is from his point of view that it will be the most prudent to discuss the work. Independently of its subject then, United is a thoroughly interesting romance. Well constructed, and perfectly clear, calculated to exercise a fascination over the most sceptical or indifferent with regard to esoteric theosophy. Moreover, though it is, and should be, no purpose of a story to convince, it is likely to attract, and, in any case, to inspire personal respect for the very obvious earnestness of the author. The main story, little broken by episode, is that of a man who transfers his entire vitality to a girl, in order to save her life, and, by his self-sacrifice, not only raises her to a higher scale of being, but has earned the right to her life in return in a loftier sphere. All this sounds very mystical, but the result is a pathos only to be obtained through skill in giving to the mystical the semblance and impression of realism—a very high form of art indeed, and very seldom carried out so well. No doubt faith, in the completest sense, has something to do with the artistic and popular success of Mr. Sinnett’s achievement in so exceedingly difficult a field.—( Graphic , July 24, 1886, London.) The above is not over-extravagant in giving a clear idea of the work, but it is fair and honest in its a p preciation. No longer notice of United has appeared, even in our Theosophical publications. We will not stop to find 308  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS any valid reasons for it, for there were none; except, perhaps, as regards The Theosophist— an instinctive fear of saying too much or too little. It is time that this remarkable novel and its esoteric truths should be more amply analyzed and thus pointed out to the attention of theosophical readers, at any rate. Hitherto there has been too much tendency in the organs of our Society to sacrifice spirit to form, to lay too much stress on isolated cases of the normal manifestations of psychic powers, instead of popularising them as a LAW IN HUMAN NATURE . This power is “l a tent in MAN ,” and not in solitary units of the human family only, though this mys tery of dual life in every man, woman and child may remain unknown to them ninety-nine times out of a hundred. This ignorance is due to our Western modes of life. Whether rich or poor, educated or illiterate—we, of the civilized nations, are born, live and die under an artificial light; a false light which, distorting our real selves like a mirror cracked in all directions, distorts our faces, and makes us see ourselves not as we are, but as our religious superstitions and social prejudices show us to ourselves. Otherwise—the Ediths and Marstons would be less rare in every class of society than they are now.

Between the eternal struggle for more gold, more honours, more power in the higher classes, and the “struggle for existence,” for bread and life, in the lower ones, there is no time or room for the manifestation of the “inner man” in us. Thus, from birth to death that E GO slumbers, paralyzed by the external man, and asserts itself only occasionally in dreams, in casu a l visions, and strange “coincidences”—unbidden and unheeded.

But once this condition is fulfilled, then truly “he who reigns within himself and rules passions, desires, and fears, is more than a king”—as Milton says: for he is an adept already; the shell alone between the inner man and the world of objective as subjective manifestation, is to be overcome; and when it offers no better resistance than a merely passive one then the higher self is as free as on the day on which that shell will be left behind him for ever. But there are rare individuals who seem born with this capacity for certain mysterious objects of karma, and whose inner SELVES are so strong as to actually reduce to noug h t the resistance of their personal or provisional bodies. Such a “rare efflorescence” of her age is Edith —first the child, and then the girl heroine of Mr. Sinnett’s novel. The author has enhanced the value of his great services to Theosophy and laid the world of thought under an additional obligation by the publication of the above novel; not as the reviewer in the Graphic thinks, because he gave “to the mystical the semblance and impression of realism,” but because he clothed REALITY —an actual psychic phenomenon which under p s eudo-impartial modern investigation and too scientific a treatment could hitherto grow no higher in public recognition than a “telepathic impact”—in such attractive yet natural garb, and presented it in such an easy reading form. To that numerous class of the reading public which has no taste for abstract metaphysical speculation, the interweaving of some true occult doctrines into the framework of such an interesting narrative is invaluable. In fact, the mystic bias now tempering so much current light literature, is in a large measure accountable for the rush of spirituality which constitutes not the least noticeable feature of the last few years. Difficult as it is to convey in an intelligible manner to the general reader the more advanced doctrines of the secret teaching, we must make the attempt. In United, a mass of lucid metaphysical 310  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS speculation is blended with the subject matter of a story of prosaic, every-day society life."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" The story opens with a description of the early life of the heroine—Edith Kinseyle—with her widowed father and a good, simple soul of a governess, in a lonely country house. The father is an ever-occupied scholar, an ardent philologist leading his own inner life of study, so absorbed in it, that “he realized for the first time that she [the wife] had been seriously ill” only when “in a gentle, unobtrusive way,” Mrs. Kinseyle “had dropped into the grave.” The first lines of the work acquaint the reader with the whole character of the heroine’s father, and thus lead him to see how much the early surroundings of the child were propitious for the development in her of her abnormal powers. She was the only child of a quiet country gentleman, of no large means, whose lack of fortune as much as the retired habits of a book-worm, had narrowed the horizon of her social life from birth, and thus thrown her forcibly upon the resources of a mental, inner world of her own. Her governess, Miss Barkley, “a tall, thin spinster, with very prominent teeth, a mild disposition and a long experience of life”—the latter quality having no effect upon her terror of ghosts—rather developed than checked in the child an early and ungovernable love for the mysterious and the “supernatural,” by thus awakening in the girl a natural spirit of innocent combativeness and malice. From the early age of six, Edith manifested an abnormal interest in the occult. She rummaged out all the old books in her father’s library to get information upon ghosts in general and “a family ghost” especially; and was frequently found by her governess perched on the entrance gate of the avenue wistfully wanting to catch a glimpse of the family ‘‘apparition”—an old knight on horseback whose astral picture occasionally curdled the blood in the veins of the rustic “elect” who happened to see it. The story of the simple child-life of that young dreamy soul evoluting from without within , so to speak, and UNITED   311 awakening with every day more to an inner instead of an outer world under the sole guidance of h e r own personal instincts—is very beautiful. Till the age of six when her mother died, the child had been left entirely to follow her own quiet tastes. It was only when placed under the necessity of either sending his daughter to school or taking a governess for her, that the widower was brought to a closer acquaintance with his child. He was quite startled and perplexed to discover that the six years old baby had a will in the choice of her future destinies. For when Ferron Kinseyle attempted to argue her into making her choice of rather school than governess, “Oh, Papa!” she cried, more in sorrow than in anger, “you don’t mean that you will send me from you against my will !” and with that she melted into tears. Both will and tears had their desired effect. Miss Edith remained at home, and time rolled on for her, calm but never monotonous, between her kind father and as kind a"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"governess on the external plane; and the fathomless world within herself she was never tired of exploring till she was seventeen. Her beauty expanded, but she preferred her quiet home to everything else. Her love of the quiet seclusion of Compton Wood was born of no shrinking timidity of nature, still less of any moros e dislike of her fellow creatures. The sunny brightness of her own temperament gilded the old house with all the gaiety she required. . . . . . Thus she passed her days between her quiet home and visits to an old manor belonging to some relati v es whither she was drawn by a “Countess’ Study,” so called, in it. It was not a “ canny habitation after dusk” for nervous people; for that “Countess” of old had left a memory after her for having practised the “black art,” and after her death her wraith had been seen at the same windows in the “moon-light.” But it was the more attractive for Edith, who had never been “nervous,” to her governess’s sorrow. In that large room of the deserted house she used to sit for long hours before dusk, while Miss Barkley ventilated her fidgety fears with Mrs. Squires, the lodge-keeper’s wife. During 312  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS one of such rests in the lodge while Edith is in the “Countess’ Study,” the governess meets with two young g entlemen—George Ferrars and Marston. After mutual introduction the former gives the curious information that he is at present engaged in following a clue for his sister, Mrs. Malcolm. The latter, who is fond of penetrating into the depths of things occult and who is a clairvoyant, has received a mysterious communication: she must become acquainted with a young girl connected with an old manor called Kinseyle-Court. His companion, Marston—the chief hero in the occult plot—turns out, later on, to be a strong mesmerizer, one deeply versed in the mysteries of psychic lore. Meanwhile, feeling more brave with two young men to protect her from possible ghosts, Miss Barkley “marvelling at the strange coincidence,” proceeds in search of Edit in company of her new acquaintances. But Edith does not answer the call from the hall. In great terror the governess rushes through the old house in search for her and finds her pupil at last. Half kneeling, half lying prostrate on the floor, her creamy white dress shining as though luminous in the moonbeams, h e r hands clasped together and her face turned upwards towards. . . . the Countess’ Study. . . . . “Oh, why did you disturb us?” she said in a dreamy tone . . . . “ I feel as if I had been in Heaven, but now she has gone. . . . . . . . .” “The beautiful angel has been here just where I am standing talking to me, for I don’t know how long, filling my mind with such rapture I can’t describe it to you . . . I have been lifted up out of myself—I can’t bear to come down again. . . . . . ” Edith cannot tear herself away from the spot where she had this first experience of living in her H i gher Self, and outside of her body. A little water brought by Marston, however, who says in a confident tone that— “It is pure water, with only a little magic in it . . . . which will not be at war with the vision” —recalls Edith back to this life, and the two—the natural born seeress and the strong adept"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"and mesmerizer, become linked in the same destiny from that hour henceforward. UNITED   313 It is not mutual love however—as no profane novel writer would fail to make it. On Edith’s part it i s not even a very acute sympathy or interest. She feels his influence later on, and chiefly during her hours of supersensuous existence, when separating from her body she lives in her “Higher-Self.” Otherwise, this first and several subsequent meetings have no immediate effects upon the girl—though Marston’s fate is sealed from that night. He becomes passionately devoted to her, but with a mystic love that has nothing of the terrestrial element in it. Edith and Marian Malcolm (Ferrars’ sister) soon become great friends and feel a passionate affection for each other. Both are mutually attracted at first, because both labour under the impression that they are visited by one and the same “Spirit Queen”—although the latter is only the glorious Spirit S ELF of the pure girl, called Edith, who thus strangely mistakes that H igher-Self for a being independent of her own individuality. Marston, the adept in occult mesmerism, finally disabuses her and reveals the truth to the young Seeress. But in doing so he seals his own destiny. There is a deadly secret in his life, a mystery that is known only to this old and trusted friend of his young days, Ferrars, and his sister, and one that makes him lead the life of a Cain, for no crime of his own. That crime––expiated by his father on the gallows—digs an abyss between himself and the girl he loves. With his mesmeric power over her it would be easy for him, as he says to Mrs. Malcolm, to have chained her life to his, but he will not do it. “Would it not have been base to do so?” he asks. As for Edith, as she brings back to earth none of the knowledge of persons and things she exhibits while plunged by Marston in her trances, she is ignorant of that great love. None of the terrestrial impurities seem to touch her, and she is wholly absorbed only in her dream-life. She even gets engaged to a worthy Colonel who adores her, but whom she consents to wed, simply because, as she writes, “I have been 3 1 4   BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS paired off by my destinies and my friends with Colonel Denby.” In one of her tr a nce states she reveals to Marston and Mrs. Malcolm that her lung is very weak and that she will not live, that in her waking hours, feeling strong and healthy, she is ignorant of the danger; though when the doctors find it out this does not seem to affect her in the least. She remains throughout the same dreamy and, at the same time, merry girl as from the first."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"It is this pre-eminently occult feature—the constant though unconscious longing for deliverance from the terrestrial bonds in every true psychic, all the attractions, happiness and joy of a young life, notwithstanding—that the author has admirably developed and described in his heroine. Her dual nature, so difficult to maintain in contrasted harmony in the same character, is drawn with a masterly hand by the author. He has created a marvellously natural combination in his heroine. Edith longs for the unalloyed bliss of a “Higher-self state” whenever she approaches the arcanum of her own nature, and yet once she is back on earth, she assumes no mystic melancholy airs, shows no disgust for life, but is thoroughly herself each time—the young and joyous daughter of the earth. “Nobody would live in the body if they knew what it was to live in the world of spirit” she argues, when lying entranced. . . “but one must never hasten the change,” she adds. And yet all the aspirations of her life in her external body seem to make her unconsciously strive after that glorious “change,” as “everything else does seem so poor and worthless compared to the glory and joy” of that disembodied yet fully conscious state Thus the two parallel lines of life of the illusive, external Edith and her H IGHER S ELF as “Spirit Queen” and her own gua r dian—reminding us of the dramatic interview of Zanoni with his shining and glorious Augoeïdes— are never blended together, and yet they present an integral whole, an artistic blending of the same spiritual individuality, the immortal reflecting itself in the mortal. UNITED   315 The reader of United finds more than one mystic scene in it, whose details are occult truths presen t ed under a semblance of romantic fiction. It is the business of the intuitional and esoteric student to discern the correct doctrine under a slightly modified form for purposes of an easier reading. The sacrifice of Sidney Marston is of an intensely dramatic character and true to life in the great and mysterious possibilities of the occult transfer of forces and even L IFE in mesmeric phenomena. In his intense and immortal love for her, his “Soul Queen,” w h o can never belong to him on this earth, Marston wants her to live and even to wed another man as he knows she could never be happy with himself. Hence he resolves to infuse into her veins and rapidly disappearing lungs the breath of life from his own organism, and then to die and vanish from this life to be ever near to her in his invisible soul-body. This he accomplishes notwithstanding her opposition, subduing her will under his stronger energy. “Be merciful and gracious and do not reject my offering,” he pleaded. “For Edith, dearest, I tell you the die is cast—the s tep istaken. I would not draw back, if I would. . . . . This day has been spent in . . . work that cannot be undone. . . . . If I had been dying from common-place illness. . . . . . I should not be more free than I am to speak to you as I am speaking. I shall never see you again my beloved, after this night. . . . . I give you my life, my own. It is my supreme act of will. . . . . It is transfusing into your being as I speak, and my heart that has been beating for you only for so long, is beating nearly its last now in glad and proud exhaustion for your sake, as it rests for the first and last time against your own. You shall be happy in this life, my glorious queen,—in this life as in the next—and you will not be pained by the recollections of this evening after the first excitement of it has passed. . . . . My beloved, we could not both be happy on this earth, and I choose to stand aside and let you pass. Anyhow I am of service to you in dying, and I can be of no"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"service to you living.” Whatever influences were working upon her, the intense excitement through which she was passing, or something else as well, were now so powerful that any coherent thought, not to speak of argumentative protest, were wholly impossible for her. She lay in his arms panting, and flushed and giddy with the tumultuous energy pulsing through her veins. . . . . Under the dominion of a different kind of 316  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS bewilderment his own words become more confused and his own sight uncertain—”Ah! I am staying too long,” he stammered. “I must go, good-bye, good-bye.” He rose to his feet, staggering as if intoxicated, clutched the chairs, and made his way to the door . . . . . . Edith came flying through the hall from the drawing-room as he was opening the carriage door. “Do not let him go!” she cried. “Marian—he is very ill. Stay! I command you to stop. I will not live without you.” “Too late! Too late!” he answered, but rather in exultation than in sorrow. “Drive on,” he called in a loud voice to the coachman. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . “He has died for me,” Edith said almost fiercely. “We shall never see him living again.” They never did; for as Edith explained it: “These things which are so strange to you are tremendous realities to him and to me. He had always been able to make m e strong—to refresh me by magnetism when I was enfeebled, and that used to exhaust him in exactly the same way it strengthened me. It was a transfer of vitality. He could give it out, I could absorb it. But these small efforts in the past were as nothing to what he found out at last to be possible. He has learned how to pour out his life in a great flood upon me, so that I have been made strong and well, and he is dead at this moment in the carriage that is driving his body to London! . . . . . . . .” Is this a fiction or a real fact in nature? Perchance, when that which Dr. Richardson calls “etheri c nerve-force,” the life principle, is better known and accepted, the seemingly impossible phenomenon will become comprehensible. If animal magnetism is a fluid, a force, an energy, call it what you will [and] can heal diseases by infusing new life-energy into the patient’s veins, why is the transfer of the whole supply of it from one body into another an impossibility? Truths are stranger than fictions, and very often so. Still they are truths and have to remain facts in nature. But the sacrifice proved useless. Instead of remaining in her physical organism, the life-energy Marston imparted to her, took another direction, and under the intense spirituality of Edith, loosened still more the bonds of union, between her astral Higher Self and the body."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" UNITED   317 Edith determined to leave her body for good. “Dear,” she said consoling Marian, “Don’t you see it must be so? Knowing what I know now, and with the consciousness so vivid of what the other life o p en to me is like, how can I possibly go on with this one?” There is a magnificent scene of clairvoyance between the two friends Marian and Edith in the old Mano r , near the “Countess’ Study,” a day or two before the last disembodiment of the latter. Then, the last scene, after Edith had prepared her father—unconscious of his approaching loss—to separation with his only child. In the night Mrs. Malcolm Felt the glorified spirit of Edith beside her, even as she lay in a state of slumber. . . . . It seemed to Mrs. Malcolm when th e morning came, that she had passed through years of time, and that the bodily Edith was a beautiful memory rather than a fact of yesterday.. . . . . . . . And then Edith bid her good-bye. The last words the vanishing spirit utters reveal the secret of her d e termining upon the untimely “change”. For she says: “It is hardly good-bye from me at all, for I shall scarcely be conscious of missing any part of you from the Higher Self that will be always with me. I shall be none the less with you because I shall be also with the one other person who has earned so thoroughly the right to blend his existence with mine. ” Marston and Edith were UNITED in Devachan “from whence no traveller returns.” The glorious “Hig h er Self” with which we are united during life, gathers around itself the Higher selves of all those whom it loved on earth with an immortal spiritual love. Thus the spirit of Edith was right in saying to Marian she would not miss “any part of her from H IGHER S ELF , who would always be present . H. P. B LAVATSKY.

Le seul résultat des foudres lancées contre moi par la Société Psychique a été de forcer l’attention publique à se partager entre les régents bulgares, M. de Bismarck, le Pape—et moi.

Je m’y suis toujours opposée; mais le courant a été plus fort que moi: il m’a renversée, et c’est sur le cadavre de ma réputation et de mon honneur que certains faits ont été portés à la connaissance du public. Quel pouvait donc être ce mobile insaisissable, mystérieux, auquel je suis accusée d’avoir obéi pendant ces quatorze dernières années, d’avoir sacrifié tout mon avoir, tout l’argent que je gagnais ailleurs avec mes travaux littéraires, toute mon énergie, ma santé—perdue pour toujours,—presque ma vie enfin? Etait-ce l’ambition, le désir de me voir célèbre? Impossible, car je m’y serais mieux prise dans ce cas. Je serais restée l’amie et l’alliée des spirites et des spiritualistes, mes plus implacables ennemis aujourd’hui. J’aurais montré un respect au moins apparent pour les missionnaires et le clergé, au lieu de les dénoncer; j’aurais brûlé de l’encens au nez des dieux de l’opinion publique et fréquenté le monde. J’y serais restée un mouton de Panurge, au lieu de montrer mon indifférence––j’allais dire mon mépris—à ce monde frivole, sans cœur, sans tête, sans entrailles pour la misère d autrui et surtout pour ceux qui lui tournent le dos. Je ne fis jamais rien de tout cela. Il devait être bien fort cependant ce motif, qui, m’ayant poussée d’abord à inventer des Adeptes et une Fraternité puissante dans les Himalayas, me contraignit ensuite à forger des lettres au nom de plusieurs d’entre eux. La tâche n’était pas facile. Les écritures de ces lettres sont aussi différentes qu’en sont les styles. Elles étaient rédigées en anglais, en français, comme en russe quelquefois: trois langues que je connais. Mais elles étaient écrites aussi, souvent, en sanscrit, en marathi, en bhâshâ, en tous les dialectes de l’Hindoustan, dont je ne sais pas le premier mot.

Selon lui, c’est par pur patriotisme et comme espionne pour le compte du gouvernement russe que j’ai inventé tout cela. L’accusation laisse beaucoup à désirer, car elle n’explique rien. De quoi les Adeptes indous et bouddhistes vivant dans les Himalayas pourraient-ils jamais faire beneficier mon pays? Comment un coup de clochette dans la botte d’un Anglo-Indien ou une cigarette passant d’une poche dans un piano pourraient-ils devenir utiles à une armée russe en train de faire une trouée dans l’Afghan? Autant de mystères qui ne font qu’embrouiller le chaos des explications scientifiques de la Société psychique.

Gurney et Myers lancèrent la Société Psychique au milieu d’une belle sonnerie de clairons qui ne fut saluée que par la éclats de rire d’un monde moqueur. Comme conclusion, ils prouvèrent quele public connaît les choses et ne se laisse pas imposer. L’affaire Coulomb s’éclaircit en un rien de temps. Hodgson est l’homme de Madras: Veni, vidi, vici. Il avait sa réputation à faire à vos dépens; c’était une question de vie ou de mort pour lui et la Société Psychique. Ainsi va le monde; nous n’avons pas à nous en plaindre, mais plutôt à nous en réjouir. La Société Théosophique est purgée: maintenant vous voyez quels sont vos vrais amis.

But why did they choose that sentence from the Hodgson decree? It is perfectly simple. That decree comes from a scientific Society, from that Society for Psychical Research which lays claim to separate the good grain from the chaff, to recognise the true from the false, and so to establish the reign of peace and brotherhood among the English materialists and spiritualists.

The latter, having sworn to all Theosophical Paris that one of the Adepts ( Mahâtmans ) had appeared to him in the astral body in his own room, had talked to him for nearly an hour, while seated on a chair before him, and had reappeared again ten minutes after leaving in order to prove that what he had seen was no dream, it follows that I am not the only one who has invented oriental Adepts—if they are mere fictions. The gentleman thus visited thinks he can get out of the scrape now by putting the public on the wrong scent. He asserts to everyone that it is Madame Blavatsky who had hypnotized him and had forced him by that method to perceive that scene. If this were so, the illusion having lasted nearly an hour, it would be rather illogical to deny me the possession of extraordinary powers. The phenomenon would only be the more remarkable. The Revue Scientifique , finding that The Occult World “might provide the subject of a curious study of the psychological condition of its author and of his heroes” (No. 16, April, p. 503), would have to begin by making this study of the two Theosophists who recruited its editor into the ranks of the Theosophical army, before permitting him to undertake it Feminine gossip and personalities do not agree well with exact science.

Solovyov published a series of articles under the title of “A Modern Priestess of Isis,” in the Russkiy Vyestnik (Russian Messenger), February-May, and September-December, 1892. They were on the whole hostile to H.P.B. They also appeared in book-form in 1893 (St. Petersburg: N. F.

She was greatly drawn to serious study, was rather widely read and had the gift of oratory. Madame de Morsier had been in correspondence with H.P.B. while the latter was in India, and was naturally attracted to her when she came to Paris.

The list is long of well-known scientists who, having ventured into the arena of spiritualism to break a lance in defence of the phenomena, have been classed by their colleagues under the label of non compos mentis. Mr. Wallace, the great London naturalist, has shut his mouth and says no more; Mr. Crookes also prefers to keep silence. Monsieur Paul Gibier is on the point of being declared an amiable lunatic, if not a charlatan, as one of his colleagues, who shall be nameless, called him; and so forth. A little logic, if you please, Messrs. Judges and Slanderers. How could the London Psychical Society pronounce in favour of all the phenomena described in The Occult World and elsewhere without risking its title of “scientific”? How would its acceptance of all that was attributed to me by the phenomenalists have been received by the scientists who deny wholesale the existence of intelligent forces outside of man? It was a question of life or death, of the to be or not to be of Hamlet. Once that the calumnies of a spiteful woman driven by vengeance, and helped by the entire black army of missionaries, were published in the evangelical organ of the latter, the Psychical Society—or rather its Theosophical founder—was forced to choose between the horns of a dilemma. One or the other: ( a ) either to declare publicly that the charges of the Coulomb lady were inventions—and in that case he and his learned Society would have to share the sorry jeers flung at the Theosophists and be drowned in a flood of ridicule, forever losing caste, as they say in India; or ( b ) sailing with the current, it would have to proclaim, in order to keep from sinking, that all the phenomena, the Mahâtmans and their agents, were a huge imposture.

Well, I am going to tell you, and I defy my enemies to refute me. That young man, with no experience whatever, without the slightest conception of psychic and other phenomena, was sent to India; he alone was prosecutor, judge, jury, and counsel, all at the same time. When he arrived, he ought to have made an investigation, studied all the phenomena of the last seven years, compared the testimony of the Theosophists with that of their accusers, and so forth. What course did he take? He only interviewed our enemies, the hydrophobic missionaries, the ex-members of the Society who had been expelled from our ranks, the scoffers, and the hardened materialists. The Protestant Christians who constitute Anglo-Indian Society, sticklers for the routine of cant, rigid in the sheath of correctness and respectability, received him with open arms. Ever since the establishment of The Theosophical Society in India, this Anglo-Indian world, the official and jealous world, showed itself as our implacable antagonist. Mr. Hodgson loved to make a figure in the drawing-rooms; he frequented the balls and dinner-parties; he had to choose between the glittering world of spurious champagne and other things, and our occult world. In this way he came to us one day to borrow the costume of a Hindû prince from one of our Theosophists, to flaunt at a fancy-dress ball given by the Governor of Madras. Once there, he publicly declared, to the great delight of the respectable and correct assembly, that The Theosophical Society was nothing but a fraud; it was, according to him, an association of duped imbeciles and intelligent swindlers.

Now then, to dispose of one final question: every act—and even more, every series of acts extending over a long period of years, committed by any individual whatever—must have necessarily a plausible motive. Every tree is judged by the fruit it bears. What, then, can be the motive that urged me to establish The Theosophical Society, to reveal what I had kept secret for long years, to throw myself, body and soul, into the jaws of the monster called Public Opinion which was waiting for me to enter the arena? The necessity of finding a motive tallying with its conclusions was so well recognised by the Psychical Society that it became its most burning question and its most arduous task. None could be found; but the following facts were discovered by Mr. Hodgson: 1. I had never accepted one cent for the phenomena. Every offer of that nature had always been refused. It –––––––––– * S e e L a L a n te r ne , a journal of the insulters; November 30, 1886. —F.K.G. –––––––––– JUDGES OR SLANDERERS?  339 was enough for anyone to offer me remuneration,* to lose any hope of getting the shadow of a phenomeno n from me. 2.

Valuable jewels were received by a good many persons, sometimes even by non-members, while on many occasions needy Theosophists or those in urgent distress received considerable sums (in one case 500 rupees or 1250 francs) in letters coming from Mahatmas, letters that I am accused of having written. 4. The poorer the Theosophist, the humbler his social standing, the more likely he was to be a witness to the greatest phenomena.

The question arises why human beings, endowed with so great a power, should amuse themselves with such trifles as are reported to us.” The bibliographer would know why if he took the trouble to read the book. A little further: “The objects on which Mme. Blavatsky exercises her power and that of the mysterious adepts . . . . are really too paltry.” The Revue Philosophique makes some similar remarks. It would be easy for us in our turn to make amiable jokes about the importance these gentlemen, who claim for themselves the monopoly of science, attribute to their limited experiences, ridiculous as they are when not dangerous. The hypnotized Nana could be exhibited, displaying signs of suggested pregnancy to the great amusement of the vulgar, or about to embrace, at very short notice, a solemn professor who, without perceiving it, serves as a laughing-stock for a troop of hussies, in order to demonstrate the neurosis of the psychosis of hypnotism . . . .

I was always opposed to this, but the current was stronger than I: it has overthrown me, and it is over the corpse of my reputation and of my honor that certain facts have been brought forward to the knowledge of the public. What, then, can that intangible, mysterious motive-power be that I am accused of obeying for the last fourteen years, to which I have sacrificed all I had, all the money I have earned elsewhere by my literary work, all my strength, my health—lost for ever—and finally almost my very life? Was it ambition, the desire to see myself famous? Impossible, for in that case I would have made a better job of it. I should have remained the friend and ally of the Spiritists and the Spiritualists, my most implacable enemies today. I should have shown respect, at least apparently so, to the missionaries and the clergy, instead of denouncing them; I should have burnt incense under the noses of the gods of Public Opinion, and have moved in good society. I ought to have played the part of a tame cat therein, instead of showing my indifference—I was about to say my contempt—for that frivolous, heartless, brainless world, pitiless for the sorrows of others, above all for those who turn their backs to it. Never have I done any one of these things. It must, however, have been a very strong motive that, having first driven me to invent Adepts and a mighty Fraternity in the Himâlayas, compelled me afterwards to forge letters in the names of several of them. It was not an easy task. The handwritings of these letters are as different as their styles They were written in English, in French, and sometimes in Russian; three languages that I know. But they were also written in Marâthi, in Bhâshâ, and in all the dialects of Hindûsthân, of which I do not know the first word.

Why? Well, the sagacious Mr. Hodgson discovered the reason. According to him, it was for pure patriotism and as a spy of the Russian Government that I invented the whole thing. That accusation leaves much to be desired, because it explains nothing. In what way could the Hindû and Buddhist Adepts, living in the Himâlayas, ever benefit my country? How could a bell-sound in the shoe of an Anglo-Indian or a cigarette passing from a pocket into a piano be of any use to a Russian army on its way to break into Afghanistan? So many mysteries merely complicate the chaos of scientific explanations of the Psychical Society. From Cape Comorin to the heights of Simla there was one loud guffaw when this accusation was read. There is not an Anglo-Indian who does not know it to be an absurdity. The English in India may say mea culpa, for the many alarms created by their chronic fear of the Russians, but they have never been so stupid as to believe a motive of this nature. They know the contrary far too well. During the first three years I passed in India, the Viceroy himself did not have such a fine escort of disguised police detectives as those who shadowed me night and day.

My nurse must have suggested to me that there were Adepts and phenomena! But who then suggested it to all those who believe they have seen Mahâtmans and phenomena with their own eyes? A new mystery! On the one hand, “a witness of the rank of Mr. Hodgson” ( Revue de l’Hypnotisme; article written by Monsieur Tétard, hypnotized to the extent of allowing the witness a rank that no one gives him in London); on the other hand, several hundred witnesses whose rank is certainly not less than that of Monsieur Tétard’s witness.

In that case, gentlemen of the press, and above all Editors of Hypnotic, Scientific, and Philosophic Magazines, for the love of science come to me, and beg for lessons in suggestion and hypnotism, instead of wasting your time in slandering me.

In that case, Drs. Charcot, Charles Richet, e tutti quanti , would not reach to my ankle. As for the poor Psychical Society, if it does not at least extend, and quickly too, the narrow outlook of its “telepathic impact,” which afflicts our ears, it will end by hypnotizing the public so effectively that there will soon be no means of awakening it. Finally, and to close this too lengthy discussion, here is a citation showing that opinions differ on this subject and that they can be separated into three, diametrically opposed.

My first thought was, to leave his “answer” without reply. Upon reading it carefully over, however, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps it would not be safe to do so. The article in question is a manifesto. I am not allowed to labour any longer under the impression that it was only an apparent disagreement. Those members and ex-members of our Society who had rejoiced at Mr. Subba Row’s remarks were consequently right in their conclusions, and I—wrong. As I do not admit—in our case, at any rate—that “a house divided against itself” must fall, for the Theosophical Society can never fall so long as its foundation is very strong, I regard the disagreement, even if real, as of no great or vital importance. Yet, were I to fail to answer the strictures in question, it would be immediately inferred that I was silenced by the arguments; or, worse, that I had expounded a tenet which had no basis. Before I say anything further upon the main subject, however, I must express my surprise at finding the learned author referring to me continually as his “critic.” I have never criticized him, nor his teachings, whether orally, or in print. I had simply expressed regret at finding in The Theosophist words calculated, as I then thought, to create false impressions. The position assumed by the lecturer on the Gita was as unexpected as it was new to me, and my remarks were meant to be as friendly as I could make –––––––––– * [This article is entitled “The Constitution of the Microcosm” and is concluded in the August issue of The Theosophist , 1887. — Compiler .] –––––––––– 346  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS them.

I can only regret, and nothing more, that such n ew developments of ideas should occur just now, after nearly seven years of tacit , if not actual, agreement."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Nor do I find on page 450 of the April Theosophist in my footnote anything that should imply, even remotely, least of all “probably,” that I endorse the views that “a slur was thrown on the original teachings.” I had said that “some (Theosophists) argued that it looked like a slur.” As for myself, I have too much reverence for the “original” T EACHERS to ever admit t h at anything said or done, could ever be “a slur” upon their teachings. But if I, personally , am made out “the original expounder,” there can be no slur whatever. It is, at the worst, a disagreement in personal views. Everyone is free in the Theosophical Society to give full expression to his own ideas—I among the rest; especially when I know that those views are those of trans -Himalayan esotericism, if not of cis -Himalayan esoteric Brahmanism, as I am now told squarely—for the first time. The words written by me in the footnote, therefore—“Of course those who do not hold to the old school of Aryan and Arhat Adepts are in no way bound to adopt the septenary classification”—were never meant for Mr. Subba Row. They applied most innocently, and as I thought liberally, to every and each member of our Association. Why my friend, Mr. T. Subba Row, should have applied them to himself is one of those mysterious combinations—evolved by my own karma no doubt—which pass my comprehension. To expect a Brahmin, a Vedantin (whether an occultist or otherwise) to accept in their dead-letter the tenets of Buddhist (even if Aryan) adepts, is like expecting a western Kabbalist, an Israelite by birth and views, to adhere to our Lord Buddha instead of to Moses. To charge me on such grounds with dogmatism and a desire to evolve “ an orthodox creed” out of tenets I have tried to explain to those who are interested in Buddhistic occultism, is rather hard. All this compels me to explain my past as well as my present position. As RE-CLASSIFIC A TION OF PRINCIPLES  347 the second portion of Mr. Subba Row’s reply can hardly contain stronger charges than I find in the firs t, I ask permission to state that:— I. Neither the original “Fragments of Occult Truth” nor yet Esoteric Buddhism, were ever meant to expound Brahminical philosophy, but that of the trans -Himalayan Arhats, as very correctly stated by Mr. Subba Row in his “ Brahmanism on the Sevenfold Principle in Man”—“. . . it is extremely difficult to show [to the profane H.P.B.!] whether the Tibetans derived their doctrine from the ancient Rishis of India, or the ancient Brahmans learned their occult science from the adepts of Tibet; or again, whether the adepts of both countries professed originally the same doctrine and derived it from a common source . . . . . However that may be, the knowledge of the occult powers of nature possessed by the inhabitants of the lost Atlantis was learnt by the ancient adepts of India and was appended by them to the esoteric doctrine taught by the residents of the sacred Island [Shambha-la]. The Tibetan adepts, however, have not accepted this addition to their esoteric doctrine. . . . .”Thus, the readers of The Theosophist were told from the first (in 1882) that they “should expect to find a difference between the two doctrines.” One of the said “differences” is found in the exoteric exposition, or form of presentation of the seven-fold principle in man."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"II. Though the fundamental doctrines of Occultism and Esoteric philosophy are one and the same the world over, and that the secret meaning under the outward shell of every old religion—however much they may conflict in appearance—is the outcome of, and proceeds from, the universal W ISDOM - RELIGION —the modes of thought and of its expression mu s t necessarily differ. There are Sanskrit words used—“Jiva,” for one—by trans-Himalayan adepts, whose meaning differs greatly in verbal applications, from the meaning it has among Brahmans in India. III. I have never boasted of any knowledge of Sanskrit, and, when I came to India last, in 1879, knew very superficially the philosophies of the six schools of 348  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Brahmanism. I never pretended to teach Sanskrit or explain Occultism in that language. I claimed to know the esoteric philosophy of the trans -Himalay a n Occultists and no more. What I knew again, was that the philosophy of the ancient Dwijas and Initiates did not, nor could it differ essentially from the esotericism of the “Wisdom-religion,” any more than ancient Zoroastrianism, Hermetic philosophy, or Chaldean Kabbala could do so. I have tried to prove it by rendering the technical terms used by the Tibetan Arhats of things and principles, as adopted in trans-Himalayan teaching (and which when given to Mr. Sinnett and others without their Sanskrit or European equivalents, remained to them unintelligible, as they would to all in India)—in terms used in Brahmanical philosophy. I may have failed to do so correctly, very likely I have, and made mistakes—I never claimed infallibility—but this is no reason why the sevenfold division should be regarded as “unscientific.” That it was puzzling I had already admitted, yet, once properly explained, it is the right one, though, in transcendental metaphysics, the quaternary may do as well. In my writings in The Theosophist I have always consulted learned and (even not very learned) Sanskrit-speaking Brahmans, giving credit to every one of them for knowing the value of Sanskrit terms better than I did. The question then is not, whether I may or may not have made use of wrong Sanskrit terms, but whether the occult tenets expounded through me are the right ones—at any rate those of the “Aryan-Chaldeo-Tibetan doctrine” as we call the “universal Wisdom-religion.” (See Five Years of Theosophy, 1st note, to Mr. Subba Row’s “Brahmanism on the Sevenfold Principle in Man,” pp. 177-79.)* IV. When saying that the seven-fold classification of principles is absolutely necessary to explain post-mortem phenomena, I repeat only that which I had always said and –––––––––– * [Subba Row ’ s essay was originally published in The Theosophist, Vol. III, Jan., 1882, pp. 93-99, and was entitled, “The Aryan-Arhat Esoteric Tenets on the Sevenfold Principle in Man.”— Compiler .] –––––––––– RE-CLASSIFICATION OF PRINCIPLES  349"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" that which every mystic will understand. “. . . Once . . . . we pass from the plane of pure subjective [or m etaphysical, hence purely theoretical ] reasoning on esoteric matters to that of practical demonstration in Occultism, wherein each [lower] principle and attribute has to be analyzed and defined in its application to the phenomena of daily and especially of post-mortem life [that of spooks and piśachas ], the sevenfold classification is the right o ne .” These are my w ords, which every spiritualist will understand. Vedantin metaphysicians, denying as they do objective reality or importance even to our physical body, are not likely to lose their time in dividing the lower principles in man, the compound aspects and nature of the phantom of that body. Practical occultism does; and it is one of the duties of those Theosophists who study occultism to warn their brethren of the dangers incurred by those who know nothing of the real nature of those apparitions: to warn them that a shell is not “ spirit. ” This statement of mine I find qualified as “simply absurd.” Having never regarded as absurd anything said or written by Mr. Subba Row, I could not retaliate even if I would, I can only pronounce the epithet, let us say— unkind, and demur to the qualification. Had the author to face “practical demonstration” in spiritual phenomena and “ materializations of spirits,” so called, he would soon find that his four principles could never cover the ground of this kind of phenomena. Even the lower aspect of the principle of manas (physical brain, or its post-mortem auric survival) and of kama rupa are hardly sufficient to explain the seemingly intelligent and spiritual principles ( bhut or elements) that manifest through mediums. V. It is not consistent with fact and truth to charge me, “the original [?] exponent herself,” with changing my conceptions about the nature of principles. “I have never changed them, nor could I do so.” In this I claim my right too, as Mr. Subba Row does, to my evidence being “the best and most direct evidence available as regards my own states of consciousness .” I may have used wrong Sanskrit expressions (and even wrong and clumsily 350  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS put English sentences, for the matter of that)—while trying to blend the Arhat with the Brahmanical oc c ult tenets. As to those conceptions, my “four principles” have to disintegrate and vanish in the air, before any amount of criticism can make me regard my ten fingers as only four; although metaphysically, I am fully prepared to admit that they exist only in my own mayavic perceptions and states of consciousness. VI. Mr. Subba Row, taking hold of Esoteric Buddhism, “The Elixir of Life” and Man,* is pleased to father all their sins of omission and commission on the “Original Expounder.” This is hardly fair. The first work was written absolutely without my knowledge, and as the author understood those teachings from letters he had received, what have I to do with them? “The Elixir of Life” was written by its author under direct dictation, or inspection, in his own house, in a far away country, in which I had never been till two years later †"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Finally Man was entirely rewritten by one of the two “chelas” and from the same materials as those used by Mr. Sinnett for Esoteric Buddhism; the two having understood the teachings, each in his own way.
