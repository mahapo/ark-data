Blavastky. As was the case with original Volume I of the Series, a considerable portion of the stock of Volume II perished in the London “blitz” during the second World War. As a result of this, these earlier Volumes have been unobtainable for many years. Discovery of hitherto unknown writings from H.P.B.’s pen required that the material be somewhat differently distributed, as far as the four original Volumes are concerned. The present Volume is made up of H.P.B.’s writings during the years of 1879 and 1880. It contains therefore some of the material of the original Volume I, and about two-thirds of the original Volume II. The text contained now in Volume II has been checked with the original sources of publication, and most of the quoted matter compared with the originals and corrected whenever necessary. Some new material has been incorporated from the Archives at Adyar. A number of explanatory notes and comments have been added by the Compiler to clarify points of Theosophical history. Biographical and Bibliographical information has been collected in the Appendix, as is the case with all the Volumes of this Series, and a copious Index has been prepared. The Compiler wishes to express his gratitude to all those who have helped in the preparation of this Volume, especially the following friends and associates. Irene R. Ponsonby who checked all the editorial material and painstakingly read the page proof, and whose thorough knowledge of literary style and methods was of inestimable help; Zoltán de Álgya- xxiv  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS Pap, of t h e Adyar Archives, whose willing assistance and readiness to help have been of such great value in t he last few years; Dara R.

Il pense donc que l’esprit et l’âme sont identiques, ou que le premier puisse être incarné ainsi que l’âme? Étrange erreur à nos yeux! Et si ce médiateur plastique est « inconscient » selon l’auteur, dans ce cas, l’âme aussi, qu’il croit immortelle, et même l’esprit doivent l’être, car, plus loin, nous le trouvons, établissant la même identité entre l’esprit et l’âme. « L’âme isolée est pour nous le périsprit » , dit-il. Nous demanderions, d’abord, comment il se peut que quelque chose « d’inconscient » —donc, d’irresponsable—puisse, dans la vie future, être, soit récompensé, soit puni, pour des actes commis durant un état d’inconscience? Ensuite, vers la fin de l’article, l’auteur nous apprend que chez l’être imparfait, le troisième élément ou –––––––––– * [A misprin t for “quaternité,” though the ordinary word would be “quaternaire.” Cf.

Ici—nous ne comprenons plus du tout! Nous ne savons si ces idées sont personnelles à l’auteur ou bien l’expression de la doctrine des spirites orthodoxes en général.* N’importe, pour nous, elles sont monstrueuses et incompréhensibles. Comment l’esprit, la suprême essence primordiale, la monade incréée et éternelle, l’étincelle directe du « Soleil central » des kabalistes, n’est plus qu’un troisième élément, aussi faillible que le périsprit? Il peut, ainsi que l’âme vitale—affligée, elle, d’une inconscience chronique, à ce qu’il paraît—devenir inconscient aussi, ne fût-ce que temporairement? L’Esprit immortel « s’abaisser au niveau d’une brute » ? Allons donc! L’auteur ne peut avoir eu la moindre idée sur nos doctrines; ou il ignore ce que nous appelons « Esprit » , car pour lui, l’Esprit et l’âme sont synonymes—ou bien, il est encore plus inconoclaste que nous. Nous nous empressons de répudier ces idées. Jamais nous n’avons professé rien de semblable. On nous cite Platon, et on oublie en même temps ce que Platon enseignait. Selon le « divin » philosophe l’âme est binaire; elle est composée de deux parties constituantes primitives, l’une—mortelle, et l’autre éternelle; la première, façonnée par les dieux créés (les forces créatrices et intelligentes de la nature), l’autre—une émanation de l’Esprit suprême. Il nous dit que l’âme mortelle en prenant possession de son corps devient « irrationelle » ; mais entre la déraison et l’inconscience il y a une différence profonde. Platon, enfin, n’a jamais confondu le périsprit, avec l’âme ni l’esprit. En commun, avec tous les autres philosophes, il ne l’appelait ni le nous ni , mais lui donnait le nom d’ , quelque fo is celui d’ imago ou de simulacrum .

Pour tous ceux qui ont étudié les philosophes grecs, il est évident que l'auteur con f ond les termes. Sa question (p. 292) «la séparation de l'espirt, , avec l'âme, nous ou périsprit . . . peut-elle être jamais cause d'une complète destruction . . . » nous fournit la clef du mésentendu. Il traduit les mots «espirt» et «âme» simplement vice versa. Nous ne savons si les Grecs modernes traduisent ces deux substantifs ainsi, mais nous sommes à même de prouver qu'aucun des anciens philosophes, ne les ont jamais définis de cette manière. Nous nous permettons de ne citer que deux noms, mais ceux-si suffiront. Notre autorité païenne est ––Plutarque; notre autorité chrétienne,––ni plus, ni maoins que saint Jacques, «le frère du Seigneur». Plutarque traitant sur l'âme nous dit que, tandis, que est emprisonnée dans le corps, le nous ou l'intell igence divine plane audessus des mortels, en versant sur sa tête un rayon qui s'illumine plus ou moins, selon le mérite personnel de l'homme; il ajoute que le nous ne descend jamais, mais reste stationnaire. Saint Jacques est plus explicite encore. Parlant de la sagesse d'ici-bas ( vide texte grec, Èpître générale, ch. iii, 15), il la traite de «terrestre, sensuelle, psychique . . », ce dernier adjectif étant traduit dans les textes anglais par le mot «diabolique». Et il ajoute (iii, 17), que ce n'est que la sagresse d'en haut qui soit divine et « noétque » (adj. Du sub. nous ). Donc l élément psychique ne semble jamais avoir été en odeur de sainteté, ni avec les saints du christianisme, ni avec les philosophes du paganisme. Puisque saint Jacques traite de diaboliqu e, et Platon en fait quelque chose d'irrationnel, peut-elle être immortelle per se? Qu'on nous permette une comparaison, la meilleure que nous puissions trouver entre le concret et l'abstrait; entre ce que notre critique appelle «la triple hypostase», et nous «la tetraktys ». Nous comparerions done ce quaternaire philosophique, composé du corps, du périsprit, de l'âme et de l'esprit––à l'éther––si bien pressenti par la science, jamais défine––et, ses corrélations subséquentes, L'éther nous repreésentera l'esprit; la vapeur morte qui s'y formera––l'âme; IDÉES INCORRECTES   7 l'eau––le périsprit; la glace––le corps.

Purifiée de ses dernières souillures, elle s’absorbe tout entiére dans sa cause première, et devient cause à son tour. Excepté le nous immortel––l’âme, le périsprit et le corps, ayant été tous créés, et eu un commencement, ils doivent avoir tous une fin. Est-ce à dire, que l’individualité est perdue dans cette absorption? Du tout. Mais entre l’ Ego humain, et l’ Ego tout divin, il y a un abîme que nos critiques comblent sans le savoir. Quant au périsprit, il n’est pass plus l’âme, que la peau délicate, qui enveloppe le fruit de l’amande, n’est le noyau, ou encore son écorce provisoire. Le périsprit n’est que le simulacre de l’homme. Il s’ensuit, que les Théosophes comprennent l’hypostase, selon les vieilles philosophies, et d’une manière toute différente de Spirites. Pour nous, l’Esprit est le dieu personnel de chaque mortel, et son seul élément divin. L’âme, binaire, par contre, n’est que semi-divine. Émanation directe du nous , tout ce qu’elle a d’essence immortelle, son cycle sur terre une fois achevé, doit nécessairement retourner à sa source-mére et––aussi pure qu’elle s’en est détachée––c’est dans cette essence toute spirituelle, que l’Église primitive, aussi fidéle que rebelle aux traditions néo-platoniciennes, crut reconnaître le bon daïmon et en fit un ange gardien; en même temps, flétrissant justement l’âme «irrationnelle» et faillible, le vrai Ego humain (d’où le mot Ego -isme), elle l’appela l’ange de ténèbres, et en fit plus tard un diable personnel. Son seul tort fut de l’anthropomorphiser, et d’en faire un monstre à queue et à cornes. Autrement, toute abstraction qu’il soit, ce diable est personnel, en effet, puis-qu’il est identique avec notre Ego . C’est lui, cette personnalité insaisissable et inaccessible, que les ascètes de tous les pays croient punir en mortifiant leur chair. L’ Ego donc, à qui nous ne concédons qu’une immortalité conditionnelle, est l’individualité purement humaine. Moitié force vitale, 8  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS moitié agrégation de qualités et d’attributs personnels, nécessaires à la formation de tout être hum a in, distinct de son prochain, l’ Ego n’est que le «souffle de la vie», que Jehovah, un des Elohim, ou dieux créateurs, souffle dans les narines d’Adam; et comme tel, et à part son intelligence supérieure, il n’est que l’élément d’individualité possédé par l’homme, en commun avec toute créature; depuis le moucheron qui se joue dans un rayon de soleil, jusqu’à l’éléphant, roi de forêts. Ce n’est qu’en s’identifiant avec cette intelligence divine, que l’ Ego tout souillé d’impuretés terrestres peut gagner son immortalité. Afin de rendre notre pensée plus clairement, nous procéderons par une question. La matière tout indestructible qu’elle soit dans ses atomes primitifs––indestructible, car, selon nous, elle est l’ombre éternelle de la Lumière éternelle, et coexite avec [elle]––cette matière, peut-elle rester immuable dans une seule de ses formes ou corrélations temporaires? Ne la voyons-nous pas, dans ses modifications incessantes, détruire aujourd’hui ce qu’elle a créé hier? Toute forme, qu’elle appartienne au monde objectif, ou à"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"celui que notre intelligence peut seule percevoir, ayant eu un commencement, doit avoir une fin. Il fut un temps où elle n’existait pas; il arrivera un jour ou elle aura cessé d’être. Or, la science moderne nous déclare que, même, notre pensée est matérielle. Que toute fugitive que soit une idéé, sa conception et ses évolutions subséquentes, nécessitent une certaine consommation d’énergie; que le moindre mouvement cérébral réverbère dans l’éther de l’espace et y produit une perturbation à l’infini. Donc, c’est une force matérielle, quoiqu’invisible. Et, s’il en est ainsi, qui oserait affirmer que l’homme, dont l’individualité est toute composée de pensées, de désirs et de passions égoistes, qui ne sont particulières, qu’à lui, et en font un individu sui generis , puisse vivre dans l’éternité avec tous ses traits distinctifs, sans changer? Et s’il change durant des cycles infinis, qu’en reste-t-il? Que devient cette individualité distinctive si prisée? Il n’est que logique de croire qu’une personne qui, déjà sur terre, IDEES I N CORRECTES   9 oubliant son moi précieu x , fut toujours prête à se sacrifier pour le bien d’autrui; qui, dans son amour pour l’humanité, s’est rendu utile dans le présent, nécessaire dans la vie future, au grand œuvre incessant de la Création, de la Préservation et de la Régénération; et qui, enfin, aspirant à l’infini, et tâchant de progresser moralement, s’est individualisée avec l’essence de son Intelligence divine, et s’est, ainsi, forcée sur le courant de l’immortalité––il n’est que logique, disons-nous, de croire qu’elle vivra en esprit éternellement. Mais qu’une autre personne qui, durant son exil de probation sur la terre, n’a envisagé la vie que comme une longue série d’actes égoïstes; qui fut inutile à elle-même comme aux autres et pernicieuse comme exemple––soit immortelle ainsi que la première––nous nous refusons de le croire! Rien n’est stationnaire dans la nature; tout doit ou avancer ou reculer, et un ivrogne incurable, un débauché tout alourdi de matérialité, n’ayant jamais fait le moindre effort vers le bien, mort ou vivant, ne progressera jamais! Il aura à subir son sort, sans que son âme divine, elle-même, puisse le sauver. L’ Ego , ou psyché terrestre, a le libre arbitre; en plus, les mystérieux avis de sa gardienne ici-bas, qui lui parle par la voie de sa conscience. Ne pouvant suivre l’homme abruti, dans sa descente rapide vers l’abîme de la matérialité, et l’homme devenu sourd à sa conscience, aveuglé à la lumière, et ayant perdu le pouvoir de s’élever vers elle, l’Essence divine, comme l’ange gardien dans les vignettes naïves de notre enfance, déploie ses blanches ailes et, laissant le dernier lien se briser entre eux, remonte vers sa patrie. L’individualité purement matérielle, peut-elle vivre dans le monde des esprits, abandonnée aux lois de la matière seulement? Nous disons non; pas plus que le poisson ne peut vivre hors de son élément naturel. Les lois sont universelles et immuables.* «Ce qui est au-dessus, est comme ce qui est au-dessous», dit le grand Hermès.

Des siècles, des milliers de siècles, peut-être, de souffrances, sont certes une punition suffisante. Nous disons, nous, qu’une telle punition serait à la fois quelque chose de trop, et de trop peu. Elle est disproportionnée aux plus grands crimes, commis durant toute une longue vie humaine; elle serait diabolique et injuste. D’un autre côté, avec l’éternité devant l’âme souffrante, et une éternité certaine, une punition semblable serait une mauvaise plaisanterie. Que sont des milliers de siècles dans l’infini! Moins qu’un clin d’œil. Il se peut que cette doctrine—comme toute autre dure vérité—semble répulsive à beaucoup de monde. Quant à nous, nous y croyons. Le sentimentalisme n’a rien à faire dans nos rangs; celui qui ne se sent pas prêt à sacrifier ses plus chères espérances personnelles à la vérité éternelle, peut devenir membre de la Société Théosophique, mais n’appartiendra jamais à notre cercle ésotérique. N’imposant à personne nos opinions, nous respectons celles des autres sans les partager. Et cependant notre Société compte des milliers d’Européens et d’Américains dans ses rangs. On assure que cette doctrine d’immortalité conditionnelle n’a été répandue parmi les masses que « pour effrayer les âmes basses et viles » . Encore une erreur. Elle n’a jamais été un dogme populaire: ni aux Indes, ni en Grèce, ni en Égypte. On n’en offrait les preuves au novice, que durant les grands mystères, lorsqu’une boisson sacrée le mettait en état de quitter son corps et, planant dans l’infinité des mondes, lui permettait d’observer et de juger par lui-même. Divulguer ce qu’il avait vu était une mort certaine, et les serments qu’on exigeait de lui, à l’ Epopteïa suprême, lorsque le grand Hiérophante lui présentait le Pétroma , ou tablettes de pierres où étaient gravés les secrets de l’initiation, étaient terribles. Seul Platon en parle en termes couverts, mais toujours il en parle. Si dans un sens il dit que l’âme est immortelle, dans un autre il nie positivement que chaque I DÉES I NCORRECTES  11 âme indi v iduelle soit pré-existée, ou qu’elle existera par la suite et pour l’éternité. La même chose a été enseignée dans tous les sanctuaires. Les égyptologues modernes en ont toutes les preuves. Mariette-Bey traduit plusieurs passages du Livre des Morts , et des inscriptions"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"sur les sarcophages, où l’immortalité conditionelle, et une annihilation complète sont en réserve pour les méchants. Une hymne à Osiris dit du mort: « Il voit par toi, vit en toi, et ce n’est que par toi qu’il peut échapper à l’ annihilation » . Les Égyptiens enseignaient aux multitudes que l’âme animale, appartenant au corps et étant indépendante de l’âme immortelle, ne les rejoignait qu’après un certain laps de temps passé dans la momie. Mais aux initiés, ils disaient qu’une annihilation complète attendait l’âme dépravée qui n’avait su devenir osirienne , ou divine. M. F. Lenormant l’affirme, ainsi que Mariette-Bey. Gotama, le philosophe indou, dit dans sa Nyâya - Sûtra (Tarkalamkara): « Le siège de la connaissance du soi (ou individualité) est dans l’âme humaine (jîvâtman), qui est binaire, mais l’âme suprême (paramâtman) est la seule qui soit omnisciente, infinie et éternelle » . Pour en finir, on nous objecte, que ceux qui ont foi dans l’immortalité, comme loi générale, regardent nos opinions comme « contraires sous tous les rapports à la justice divine » . Nous répondons: Qu’en savez-vous de cette justice? Sur quoi basez-vous vos idées en supposant que les lois du monde invisible soient tout autres que celles d’ici-bas, tout en laissant de coté la loi, bien constatée par la science, de la survivance du plus apte, loi, qui certe ne serait pas de mince valeur dans notre argument? Nous ne demandons que des preuves valables à l’appui du contraire. On peut nous faire remarquer, qu’il nous serait peut-être aussi difficile qu’à nos critiques de prouver la vérité sur nos doctrines, à nous? D’accord, nous confessons de suite que, tout en y croyant, nous n’en savons que ce qui nous en a été enseigné. Mais notre doctrine à nous est appuyée du moins sur la philosophie et sur la psychologie expérimentale (comme celle du système des Yoga indous), fruits des recherches de long siècles. Nos maîtres sont Patañjali, Kapila, Kanada, tous ces systèmes et écoles de l’Aryâvarta (l’Inde antique) 12  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS qui servirent de mines inépuisables pour les philosophes grecs, depuis Pythagore jusqu’à Proclus . El le est basée sur la sagesse ésotérique de la vieille Égypte, où Moïse comme Platon sont allés se faire instruire par ses hiérophantes et adeptes; elle s’est développée enfin, sur la méthode si sûre qui ne procède qu’inférentiellement, ne juge que par la stricte analogie et qui, se basant sur l’immuabilité des lois universelles, ne déduit que par induction. Nous sera-t-il permis de demander à nos adversaires, de nous montrer quelles sont leurs autorités à eux? Est-ce la science moderne? Mais la science docte se moque de vous comme de nous. Est-ce la Bible mosaïque? Nous en doutons, car elle n’en souffle pas un mot, et toutes les tortures appliquées à son texte pendant de longs siècles de recherche, et malgré toutes ses éditions revues et corrigées , elle reste muette à ce sujet. Mais dans plusieurs endroits touchant la survivance de l’âme, elle nous coupe l’herbe sous les pieds. Dans les Ecclésiastes (chap. iii, 19) la Bible n’accorde à l’homme aucune prééminence sur la brute; comme l’une meurt, ditelle, ainsi meurt l’autre, car le souffle qui les anime tous deux est le même . Quant à Job, cet illustre affligé nous affirme que l’homme, une fois mort, « s’enfuit comme une ombre, et — ne continue pas » ( Job , xiv, 2).* Est-ce le Nouveau Testament?

H. P. Blavatsky. [Editor.] “Criticism is easy; art is difficult!”   —Destouches, Philinte , I D, Act II, sc. 5. The Theosophical Society of New York, founded in 1875, and later, according to the orders o f its heads in India, entirely reconstructed, is established on the plan of every secret society. It is plain, then, that its doctrines cannot be common property. In spite of that, the American Press—above all the Spiritualistic papers—have incessantly dissected, criticized and turned them into ridicule, invariably setting up as doctrines of the Theosophists what are nothing but conjectures on their own part. The little that it was permissible to reveal to them, however, was done as clearly as is possible in the English language, which is rather poorly adapted to the expression of metaphysical ideas. Mirabile dictu ! Not only did they turn a deaf ear to our explanations, but as soon as the criticisms of our opponents began to be crushed, the doors of the papers were politely shut in our faces! It is indeed time, in this blindman’s buff polemic, to throw a little daylight into this Cimmerian darkness where the light often has been extinguished—one would almost say by design. A criticism on “The Elementaries and the Elementals,” published in the August number of La Revue Spirite , offers us an opportunity. E R R O N E O U S IDEAS  15 Yes, “for the New York Theosophists, man is a trinity and not a duality.” But he is more than tha t , however; by adding the physical body, man is a Tetraktys , or maternity.* But, supported as we are in this particular doctrine by the greatest philosophers of ancient Greece—as the author of the article remarks—it is neither to Pythagoras, nor Plato, nor the famous Theodidaktoi of the Alexandrian School, that we owe it. We will speak of our own teachers later on. We will first prove that the critic in La Revue Spirite strays from the facts in his article, concerning all that relates to the historical doctrines of antiquity, and"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"that—quite innocently no doubt, and, as the result of judging only from abridged translations he disfigures ours. First of all, he is deceived—according to us—when, believing himself to be correcting our notions, and having a moment before treated of “incarnated souls” (p. 291), he speaks (p. 292) of a “plastic and unconscious mediator, or the perisprital fluid that serves to envelope the spirit.” Does he consider then, that the spirit and the soul are identical, or that the former can be incarnated like the soul? A strange mistake in our eyes! And if that plastic mediator is “unconscious,” according to the writer, in that case, the soul also, which he thinks immortal, and even the spirit, must be so, because further on we find him establishing the exact identity of the spirit and the soul. “The soul, isolated, is for us the périsprit,” he says. We will ask, first, how can it be that anything “unconscious”—hence, irresponsible—can be, in a future life, either rewarded or punished for acts committed during an unconscious state? Later on, towards the close of the article, the author tells us that, in an imperfect being, the third element, or the Spirit, cannot be annihilated, but for an indefinite period loses the consciousness of its greatness and may be degraded to the level of the brute. Here we completely fail to understand him! We do not know if these ideas are personal to the author or rather the expression of the teaching of the –––––––––– * [ A m is p r in t for “quaternity.”— Compiler .] –––––––––– 16  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS orthodox spiritists in general.* No matter; for us they are monstrous and incomprehensible. How can the s p irit, the supreme primordial essence, the uncreated and eternal monad, the direct spark from the “central Sun” of the Kabalists, be no more than a third element, as fallible as the périsprit? Can it, like the vital soul—afflicted with a chronic unconsciousness, it would appear—become unconscious also, be it but temporarily? Can the immortal Spirit “be degraded to the level of a beast”? Nonsense! the author cannot have the least notion of our teachings; either he is ignorant of what we call “spirit,” because for him the spirit and the soul are synonymous—or rather, he is still more iconoclastic than ourselves. We hasten to repudiate those ideas. We have never professed anything like them. Plato is quoted to us and, at the same time, what Plato taught is forgotten. According to the “divine” philosopher the soul is dual; it is composed of two primitive constituent parts: one—mortal, the other eternal; the former, fashioned by the created gods (the creative and intelligent forces in nature), the other, an emanation from the supreme Spirit. He tells us that the mortal soul, in taking possession of its body, becomes “irrational”; but between irrationality and unconsciousness there is a profound difference. Plato, finally, never confused the périsprit with the soul or the spirit. In common with every other philosopher, he called it neither the nous nor , but gave it the name , sometimes that of imago or simulacrum ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Let us try, then, to re-establish a little order in this confusion. Let us give everything its true name, and state precisely the difference between the opinions of our learned critic and our own. For all who have studied the Greek philosophers, it is clear that the author confuses terms. His question (p. 292), “Can the separation of the spirit, , from the soul, nous or p érisprit, ever be the cause of a complete destruction . . .?” provides us with the key –––––––––– * There are no orthodox spiritists but simply researchers, investigators who accept every demonstrated truth [Editor]. –––––––––– ERRONEOUS IDEAS   17 to the misunderstanding. He translates the words “spirit” and “soul” simply vice versa . We do not know if the modern Greeks so translate those two nouns, but we are able to prove that none of the ancient philosophers have ever defined them in that way. We will allow ourselves to quote two names, but those will suffice. Our pagan authority is—Plutarch; our Christian authority is no more and no less than Saint James, “the brother of the Lord.” In treating of the soul Plutarch tells us that while is imprisoned in the body, the no us or the divine intelligence soars above mortal man, shedding upon him a ray that is more or less luminous according to the personal merit of the man; he adds that the nous never descends but remains stationary. Saint James is still more explicit. Speaking of the wisdom from below ( vide the Greek text, General Epistle , iii, 15) he treats it as “terrestrial, sensual, psychic ,” this last adjective being translated in the English text by the word “diabolical,” and (iii, 17) he adds that it is only the wisdom from above that is divine and “ noetic ” (adj. of the sub. nous ).* So the psychic element never seems to have been in the odor of sanctity, either with the Saints of Christianity or with the Philosophers of Paganism. Since Saint James treats as diabolical and Plato makes something irrationa l of it, can it be immortal per se ? May we be allowed a comparison, the best we can find, between the concrete and the abstract; between what our critic calls “the triple hypostasis” and we “the tetraktys ”? Let us compare this philosophic quaternary, composed of the body, the périsprit, the soul and the spirit—to the ether—so well foreseen by science, but never defined—and its subsequent correlations. The ether will represent the spirit for us; the dead vapor that is formed therein—the soul; –––––––––– * [This sentence and explanation are somewhat confused. King James’ version gives the following text for chapter iii, verse 15: “This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.” The Greek text shows the words: epigeios , psychikê , and daimoniôdês , which are translated as “earthly, soulical, demoniacal” in a literal translation of the Greek text.— Compiler .] –––––––––– 18  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" water—the périsprit; ice—the body. The ice melts and for ever loses its shape, water evaporat es and is dispersed in space; the vapor is liberated from its grosser particles and finally reaches that condition in which science cannot follow it. Purified from its last defilements, it is entirely absorbed into its first cause, and becomes a cause in its turn. With the exception of the immortal nous —the soul, the périsprit and the body, all having been created and having had a beginning, must all have an end. Does that mean that the individuality is lost in that absorption? Not at all. But between the human Ego and the wholly divine Ego , there is an abyss that our critics fill in without knowing it. As to the périsprit, it is no more the soul than the delicate skin that surrounds the almond is the kernel itself or even its temporary husk. The périsprit is but the simulacrum of the man. It follows that Theosophists understand the hypostasis, according to the old philosophers, in a very different way from the Spiritualists. For us, the Spirit is the personal god of each mortal, and his only divine element. The dual soul, on the contrary, is only semidivine. Being a direct emanation from the nous , everything it has of immortal essence, once its earthly cycle is accomplished, must necessarily return to its mother-source, and as pure as when it was detached; it is that purely spiritual essence which the primitive church, as faithful as it was rebellious to the Neo-Platonic traditions, thought it recognized in the good daïmon and made into a guardian angel; at the same time justly blighting the “irrational” and fallible soul, the real human Ego (from which we get the word Egoism), she called it the angel of darkness, and afterwards made it into a personal devil. The only error was in anthropomorphizing it and in making it a monster with tail and horns. Otherwise, abstraction as it may be, this devil is truly personal because it is identical with our Ego . It is this, the elusive and inaccessible personality, that ascetics of every country think they chastise by mortifying the flesh. The Ego then, to which we concede only a conditional immortality, is the purely human individuality. Half vital ERRONEO U S IDEAS  19 energy, half an aggregation of personal qualities and attributes, necessary to the constitution of every h uman being as distinct from his neighbor, the Ego is only the “breath of life” that Jehovah, one of the Elohim or creative gods, breathed into the nostrils of Adam; and, as such, and apart from its higher intelligence, it is but the element of individuality possessed by man in common with every creature, from the gnat that dances in the rays of the sun to the elephant, the king of the forest. It is only by identifying itself with that divine intelligence that the Ego , soiled with earthly impurities, can win its immortality. In order to express our thought more clearly, we will proceed by a question. Though matter may be quite indestructible in its primitive atoms—indestructible, because, as we say, it is the eternal shadow of the eternal Light and co-exists with it—can this matter remain unchangeable in its temporary forms or correlations? Do we not see it, during its ceaseless modifications, destroy today what it created yesterday? Every form, whether it belongs to the objective world or to that which our intelligence alone can perceive, having"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"had a beginning, must have an end. There was a time when it did not exist; there will come a day when it will cease to be. Now, modern science tells us that even our thought is material. However fleeting an idea may be, its conception and its subsequent evolutions require a certain consumption of energy; let the least cerebral motion reverberate in the ether of space and it will produce a disturbance reaching to infinity. Hence, it is a material force, although invisible. And, if that is so, who would dare to affirm that man, whose individuality is composed of thoughts, of desires and selfish passions, which are peculiar to him, and which make him an individual sui generis , can live in eternity with all his distinctive traits, without changing? And if he changes during infinite cycles, what remains of him? What becomes of that separate individuality that is so much prized? It is only logical to believe that a person who already on earth, forgetting his precious self , was ever ready to sacrifice himself for the welfare of others; 20  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS who, in his love for humanity, has made himself useful in the present life and necessary in the futu r e life, for the great and ceaseless work of Creation, of Preservation and of Regeneration; and who finally, aspiring to the infinite and striving to progress morally, individualizes himself with the essence of his divine intelligence, and is, thus, forced into the current of immortality—it is but logical, we say, to believe that he will live in spirit eternally. But that another person who, during his probationary exile on earth envisaged life but as a long series of selfish actions, who was as useless to himself as to others, and pernicious as an example —should be immortal like the former—is impossible for us to believe! Nothing is stationary in nature; everything must advance or fall back, and an incurable drunkard, a debauchee wholly immersed in materiality, having never made the least effort towards the good, dead or living, will never make progress! He will have to submit to his fate, even his divine soul not being able to save him. The Ego , or terrestrial psychê, has free will, and, moreover, the mysterious counsel of its guardian here on earth, which speaks through the voice of conscience. Being unable to follow the brutalized man in his rapid descent toward the abyss of materiality—the man who is deaf to his conscience, blind to the light, and who has lost the power of raising himself towards it—the Divine Essence, like the guardian angel of the naïve woodcuts of our childhood, spreads its white wings and, breaking the last link between them, re-ascends towards its own realms. Can the purely material individuality live in the world of spirits if abandoned to the laws of matter alone? We say no; no more than a fish can live outside its natural element. Laws are universal and immutable.* “That which is above is like that which is below,” said the great Hermes. The newborn child cannot live if it lacks vital force, and dies without having seen the light; neither will the ego , entirely deprived of spiritual force, have the strength to be born or to exist in the region of spirits. If it is only weak and withered—it may survive— –––––––––– * This s h ould be meditated upon and discussed [Editor]."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"–––––––––– ERRONEOUS IDEAS  21 “as it is on earth, so it is in heaven.” But, it will be said, the evil souls do not remain unpunis h ed. Ages, thousands of ages, perhaps, of suffering are surely a sufficient punishment. We say that such a punishment would be at the same time too much and hardly enough. It would be disproportionate even to the greatest crimes committed throughout the whole of a long human life; it would be diabolical and unjust. On the other hand, with eternity before the suffering soul, and an absolutely certain eternity, such a punishment would be merely a bad joke. What are thousands of ages in infinity! Less than the wink of the eye. It may be that this teaching—like every other plain truth—seems repulsive to many people. As for us, we believe it. Sentimentality has no place in our ranks; he who does not feel ready to sacrifice his dearest personal hopes to the eternal truth may become a member of the Theosophical Society, but will never belong to our Esoteric Circle. Without forcing our opinions on anyone, we respect those of others without sharing them. And yet our Society reckons thousands of Europeans and Americans in its ranks. It is said that this doctrine of conditional immortality was circulated among the masses only “to terrify low and depraved souls.” Still another error. It has never been a popular doctrine; either in India, Greece or Egypt. Its proofs were given only to the neophyte, during the great Mysteries, when a sacred beverage enabled him to leave his body and, soaring in the infinity of worlds, observe and judge for himself. To divulge what he then saw was certain death; and terrible were the oaths that were demanded of him, at the supreme Epopteïa when the grand Hierophant offered him the Petroma , or stone tablets on which were engraved the secrets of initiation. Plato alone spoke of it, in veiled terms, but he did speak of it. If in one sense he said that the soul is immortal, in another he positively denied that each individual soul had pre-existed or that it will exist afterwards and for eternity. The same thing was taught in every sanctuary. Modern Egyptologists have all the proofs of it. Mariette-Bey translated several 22  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS passages in the Book of the Dead and from i nscriptions in sarcophagi where conditional immortality and complete annihilation are in store for the wicked. One hymn to Osiris says of the defunct: “He sees by Thee, he lives in Thee and it is only by Thee that he can escape annihilation .” The Egyptians taught the masses that the animal soul, belonging to the body and independent of the immortal soul, would not rejoin it until after a certain lapse of time passed in the mummy. But to the initiate, they said that complete annihilation awaited the depraved souls which had not succeeded in becoming Osirified or Divine. F. Lenormant declares this, as also does Mariette-Bey. Gotama, the Hindu philosopher, says in his"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Nyâya-Sûtra (Tarkalamkara): “The seat of the knowledge of the self (or individuality) is in the human soul (jîvâtman), which is dual, but the supreme soul (paramâtman) is the only one that is omniscient, infinite and eternal.” To finish with the question, the objection is brought against us that those who have faith in immortality as a general law, regard our opinions as “in every respect contrary to divine justice.” We answer: “What do you know of that justice? Upon what do you base your ideas in supposing that the laws of the invisible world are any different from those of this world, entirely laying aside the well-established scientific law of the survival of the fittest, which would certainly be of no small consequence in our argument?” We ask only for valid proofs in support of the contrary. Possibly we may be told that it would perhaps, be as difficult for us to prove the truth of our doctrines as for our critics to prove theirs. Agreed! We instantly confess that, in believing them, we know only what we have been taught. But our teaching rests at least on philosophy and on experimental psychology (such as that of the system of the Hindu Yogis ), results of long ages of research. Our Masters are Patañjali, Kapila, Kanâda, all the systems and schools of Âryâvarta (archaic India) which served as inexhaustible mines for the Greek philosophers, from Pythagoras to Proclus. It is based on the esoteric wisdom of ancient Egypt, where Moses, like Plato, went to learn from E R R O N E O U S IDEAS   23 the Hierophants and Adepts; it was therefore developed by sure methods that do not proceed b y inference, but decide by strict analogy alone, are based on the immutability of universal laws, and proceed by induction. May we be allowed to ask our opponents to show us their authority? Is it modern science? But learned science laughs at you as it does at us. Is it the Mosaic Bible? We doubt it because it does not breathe a word of it, and in spite of all the tortures applied to its text during long centuries of research, and notwithstanding all its revised and corrected editions, remains mute on the subject. But in several places, touching upon the survival of the soul, it cuts the ground under our feet. In Ecclesiastes (iii, 19) the Bible gives man no preeminence at all over the brute; as the one perishes, so does the other, for the breath that animates them both is the same . As to Job, that illustrious sufferer declares to us that man, once dead “disappears like a shadow, and— continues no more ” ( Job , xiv, 2). Is it the New Testament? That book offers the choice between a philharmonic paradise and a hell which is far from being a real one. It gives us no irrefutable proof, it prohibits us from reasoning, and insists upon blind faith . Is it the phenomena of Spiritualism? Here we are! Now we are on firm ground, for the proofs are palpable, and it is “spirits” who are our teachers. Theosophists believe in the manifestations and in the “spirits” as much as the Spiritualists. But—when you have finished demonstrating to the whole world, including sceptical science, that our phenomena are produced by the souls of the departed—what will you have proved? The survival of man at the utmost; his immortality you will never prove; neither as a general law nor “as a conditional reward.” Thirty years of experience with the “spirits” have not given us an impression in favor of their veracity as a “general law”; you have nothing more, then, to"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"confute us than your blind faith , your emotions, and the instinct of a minority of humanity.

Our doctrine, you say, “was invented for low and vulgar souls.” We are in a position to prove to you, statistics in hand, that these “low and vulgar” souls predominate in the civilized and Christian countries where immortality is promised to everyone. We refer you to America, puritanic and pious, which promises every criminal it hangs an eternal Paradise, if he will believe; and that immediately, because, according to the Protestants, there is less than one step from the foot of the scaffold to the foot of the Eternal. Open a New York paper; you will find the first page entirely covered with news of the most atrocious, the most unheard-of crimes committed by the dozen, every day, and from one end of the year to the other. We challenge anyone to find anything like it in pagan countries, where people do not trouble themselves at all about immortality, and where they ask only to be absorbed forever. Is immortality then, as a “general law,” rather a stimulant to, than a preventive against, crime for every “low and vulgar” soul? We close believing that we have answered all the accusations of the author of the article on “The Elementaries.” If our teachings interest the reader we will try to be more explicit in a future number.

Before en tering upon the main question that compels me to ask you kindly to accord me space in your esteemed paper, will you inform me as to the nature of that newly-born infant prodigy which calls itself The Bombay Review ? Is it a bigoted, sectarian organ of the Christians, or an impartial journal, fair to all, and unprejudiced as every THE IND I AN \"PUBLIC\" AND THEOSOPHY  25 respectable paper styling itself “Review” ought to be, esp e cially in a place like Bombay, where such a diversity of religious opinions is to be found? The two paragraphs in the number of February 22nd, which so honour the Theosophical Society by a double notice of its American members, would force me to incline towards the former opinion. Both the editorial which attacks my esteemed friend, Miss Bates, and the apocalyptic vision of the modern Ezekiel, alias “Anthroposophist,” who shoots his rather blunt arrows at Colonel Olcott, require an answer, if it were but to show the advisability of using sharper darts against Theosophists. Leaving the seer to his prophetic dream of langooty and cowdung, I will simply review the editorial of this Review which tries to be at the same time satirical and severe and succeeds only in being nonsensical. Quoting from another paper a sentence relating to Miss Bates, which describes her as “ not a Christian ,” it remarks in that bitter and selfish spirit of arrogance and would-be superiority, which so characterizes Christian sectarianism: “The public might have been spared the sight of the italicized personal explanations.” What “public” may I ask? The majority of the intelligent and reading public—especially of native papers—in Bombay as throughout India is, we believe, composed of non-Christians—of Pârsîs, Hindus, etc. And this public instead of resenting such “wanton aggressiveness,” as the writer pleases to call it, can but rejoice to find at least one European lady, who, at the same time that she is not a Christian, is quite ready, as a Theosophist, to call any respectable “heathen” her brother, and regard him with at least as much sympathy as she does a Christian. But this unfortunate thrust at Theosophy is explained by what follows: “In the young lady’s own interest the insult ought not to have been flung into the teeth of the Christian public.” Without taking into consideration the old wise axiom, that honesty is the best policy, we can only regret for our Christian opponents that they should so soon “unveil” their cunning policy. While in the eyes of every honest “heathen”"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 26  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Theosophist, there can be no higher recommendation for a person than to have the reputat i on of being truthful even at the expense of his or her “interest,” our Christian Review unwittingly exposes the concealed rope of the mission machinery, by admitting that it is in the interest of every person here, at least—to appear a Christian or a possible convert, if he is not one de facto . We feel really very, very grateful to the Review for such a timely and generous confession. The writer’s defense of the “public” for which it speaks as one having authority is no less vague and unsatisfactory, as we all know that among the 240,000,000 of native population in India, Christians count but as a drop in an ocean. Or is it possible that no other public but the Christian is held worthy of the name or even of consideration? Had converted Brâhmans arrived here instead of Theosophists, and one of these announced his profession of faith by italicizing the words, not a heathen , we doubt whether the fear of hurting the feelings of many millions of Hindus would have ever entered the mind of our caustic paragraphist! Nor do we find the sentence, “India owes too much to Christianity,” anything but arrogant and presumptuous talk. India owes much and everything to the British Government which protects its heathen subjects equally with those of English birth, and would no more allow the one class to insult the other than it would revive the Inquisition. India owes to Great Britain its educational system, its slow but sure progress, and its security from the aggression of other nations; to Christianity it owes nothing. And yet perhaps I am mistaken, and ought to have made one exception. India owes to Christianity its mutiny of 1857, which threw it back for a century.

Such is the position of my opponent of the world-famed Bombay Review . Realizing the impossibility of injuring the Theosophical Society, he “makes faces” at its Corresponding Secretary, flinging at her personal abuse. Unfortunately for my masked enemies and fortunately for myself, I have five years’ experience in fighting American newspapers, any one of which, notwithstanding the grandiloquent style of the “Anthroposophists,” “B’s,” and “Onesimuses” is any day more than a match in humour, and especially in wit, for a swarm of such pseudonymous wasps as work on the Review .

Again he has found a mare’s nest in my garden—a chronological, instead of a metaphysical, one this time. He is exercised about my age, as though the value of my statements would be in the least affected by either rejuvenating me to infancy, or aging me into a double centenarian. He has read in the Revue Spirite for October last a sentence in which, discussing this very point, I say that I have not passed thirty years in India, and that: « C ’ est justement mon âge — quoique fort respectable tel qu ’ il est—qui s ’ oppose violemment à cette chronologie , etc. » I reproduce the sentence exactly as it appears, with the sole exception of restoring the period after “ l ’ Inde ” in place of the comma, which is simply a typographical mistake.

The writer seems neither an enemy of our cause, nor hostile to the Society; therefore I will try in a gentle spirit to correct certain misapprehensions under which he labours. As he signs himself “A Member,” he must, therefore, be regarded by us as a Brother . And yet he seems moved by an unwarranted fear to a hasty repudiation of too close a connection between our Society and his Samâj, lest the fair name of the latter be compromised before the public by some strange notions of ours! He says: I have been surprised to hear that the Society embraces people who believe in magic . . . Should this, however , be the belief of the Theosophical Society, I could only assure your readers that the Ârya Samâj is not in common with them in this respect. . . . Only as far as Vedic learning and Vedic philosophy is concerned, their objects may be said to be similar. It is these very points I now mean to answer. The gist of the whole question is as to the correct d efinition of the word “magic,” and understanding of what Vedic “learning and philosophy” are. If by magic is meant the popular superstitious belief in sorcery, witchcraft and ghosts in general; if it involves the admission that supernatural feats may be performed; if it requires faith in miracles , that is to say, phenomena outside natural law; then, on behalf of every Theosophist, whether a sceptic yet unconverted, a believer in, and student of phenomena pure and simple, or even a modern Spiritualist so-called— i . e ., one who believes 32  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS mediumistic phenomena to be necessarily caused by returning human spirits—we emphati c ally repudiate the accusation. We did not see The Civil and Military Gazette , which seems so well acquainted with our doctrines; but if it meant to accuse any Theosophists of any such belief, then like many other Gazettes and Reviews it talked of that which it knew nothing about. Our Society believes in no miracle, divine, diabolical or human, nor in anything which eludes the grasp of either philosophical and logical induction, or the syllogistic method of deduction. But if the corrupted and comparatively modern term of “magic” is understood to mean the higher study and knowledge of nature and deep research into her hidden"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"powers—those occult and mysterious laws which constitute the ultimate essence of every element, whether with the ancients we recognize but four or five, or with the moderns over sixty; or, again, if by magic is meant that ancient study within the sanctuaries known as the “worship of the Light,” or divine and spiritual wisdom as distinct from the worship of darkness or ignorance, which led the initiated High-priests of antiquity among the Âryans, Chaldaeans, Medes and Egyptians to be called Maha , Magi or Maginsi , and by the Zoroastrians Meghistom (from the root Meh ’ al , great, learned, wise)—then, we Theosophists “plead guilty.” We do study that “Science of Sciences,” extolled by the Eclectics and Platonists of the Alexandrian Schools, and practised by the theurgists and the mystics of every age. If, magic gradually fell into disrepute, it was not because of its intrinsic worthlessness, but through misconception and ignorance of its primitive meaning, and especially the cunning policy of Christian theologians, who feared lest many of the phenomena produced by and through natural (though occult) law should give the direct lie to, and thus cheapen “Divine biblical miracle,” and so forced the people to attribute every manifestation that they could not comprehend, or explain—to the direct agency of a personal devil. As well accuse the renowned Magi of old, of having M A G I C   33 had no better knowledge of divine truth and the hidden powers and possibilities of physical law than t heir successors, the uneducated Pârsî Mobeds , or the Hindu Mahârâjas of that shameless sect known as the Vallabhâchâryas, both of whom yet derive their appellation from the Persian word Mog or Mag , and the Sanskrit Mahâ . More than one glorious truth has thus tumbled down through human ignorance from the sublime into the ridiculous. Plato, and even the sceptical Lucian, both recognized the high wisdom and profound learning of the Magi ; and Cicero, speaking of those who inhabited Persia of his times, calls them “ sapientium et doctorum genus majorum .” And if so, we must evidently believe that these Magi or “Magicians” stood somewhat higher than the modern Maskelyns and Cooks — the style of magicians that were not such as London sees at a shilling a seat—or yet certain fraudulent Spiritual mediums. The science of such theurgists and philosophers as Pythagoras, Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus, Bruno, Paracelsus and a host of other great men, has now fallen into disrepute. But, had our Brother Theosophist—Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the telephone and the phonograph, lived in the days of Galileo, he would have surely expiated on the rack or at the stake his sin of having found the means to fix on a soft surface of metal, and preserve for long years the sounds of human voice; for his talent would have been pronounced the gift of Hell. And yet, such an abuse of brute power to suppress truth would not have changed a scientific discovery into a foolish and disreputable superstition. But our friend “A member” consenting to descend to our level in one point at least admits h i mself that in “Vedic learning and philosophy” the Ârya Samâj and the Theosophical Society are upon a common ground. Then, I have something to appeal to as"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"an authority which will be better still than the so-much-derided Magic, theurgy and Alchemy. It is the Vedas themselves: for “Magic” is brought in every line of the sacred books of the Âryans . Magic is indispensable for the comprehension of either of the six great schools of Âryan philosophy. And, it is precisely to understand 34   BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS them and thus enable ourselves to bring to light the hidden summum bonum of that mother of all Eastern p hilosophies known as the Vedas , and the later Brâhmanical literature, that we study it. Neglect this study, and we, in common with all Europe, would have to set Max Müller’s interpretations of the Vedas far above those of Svami Dayânanda Sarasvatî, as given in his Veda-Bhâshya . And we would have to let the Anglo-German Sanskritist go uncontradicted, when he says that with the exception of the Rig , none other of the four sacred books is deserving of the name of Veda , especially Atharva Veda which is absurd magical nonsense, composed of sacrificial formulas, charms and incantations (see his “Lecture on the Vedas”).* This is, therefore, why, disregarding every misconception, we humbly beg to be allowed to follow the analytical method of such students and practitioners of “magic” as Kapila mentioned in the Śvetâśvatara Upanishad † as “the Ris hi nourished wi t h knowledge by the God himself”; Patañjali, the great authority of the Yogis, Ś amkarâchârya of theurgic memory, and—even Zoroaster who certainly learned his wisdom from the initiated Brâhmans of Âryavarta. And we do not see why, for that, we should be held up to the world’s scorn, as either superstitious fools or hallucinated enthusiasts, by our own brother of the Ârya Samâj. I will say more: while the latter is, perhaps, in common with other “members” of the same Samâj, unable and perfectly helpless to defend Svami Dayânanda against the sophistry of such partial scoffers as a certain Pandit Mahesa Chandra Nyayaratna, of Calcutta, who would have us believe the Veda-Bhâshya a futile attempt at interpretation, we. Theosophists, do not shrink from assuming the burden. When the Svami affirms that Agni and Î ś vara are identical, the Calcu tt a Pandit calls it “stuff.” To him Agni means the coarse, visible fire, with which one melts his ghee and cooks his rice cakes. Apparently he does not know, as he might, if he had studied “magic,” that is to say, had familiarized himself with the views about the divine fire or light, “whose ––––––––––– * [In his Chip s from a German Workshop , Vol. I.— Compiler .] † [Chapter V, verse 2.] ––––––––––– MAGIC   35 external body is flame,” held by the mediaeval Rosicrucians (the fire-philosophers) and all their initia t ed predecessors, and successors, that the Vedic Agni is in fact Î ś vara and nothi ng else. The Svami makes no mistake when he says:"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"For Agni is all the deities and Vishnu is all the deities. For these two (divine) bodies, Agni and Vishnu, are the two ends of the sacrifice. At one end of the ladder which stretches from heaven to earth is Î ś vara—Spirit, Suprem e Being, subjective, invisible and incomprehensible; at the other his visible manifestation, “sacrificial fire.” So well has this been comprehended by every religious philosophy of antiquity that the enlightened Pârsî worships not gross flame but the divine Spirit within, of which it is the visible type; and even in the Jewish Bible there is the unapproachable Jehovah and his down-rushing fire which consumes the wood upon the altar and licks up the water in the trench about it ( I Kings , xviii, 38). There also is the visible manifestation of God in the burning bush of Moses, and the Holy Ghost in the Gospels of Christians, descending like tongues of flame upon the heads of the assembled disciples on the day of Pentecost. There is not an esoteric philosophy or rather theosophy, which did not apprehend this deep spiritual idea, and each and all are traceable to the Vedic sacred books. Says the author of The Rosicrucians in his chapter on “The Nature of Fire,” and quoting R. Fludd, the mediaeval Theosophist and Alchemist: Wonder no longer then, if [in the religions of the Aryans, Medes and Zoroastrians], rejected so long as an idolatry, th e ancient Persians and their masters the Magi—concluding that they saw “All” in this supernaturally magnificent element [fire]—fell down and worshipped it; making of it the visible representation of the very truest, but yet, in man’s speculation, and in his philosophies—nay, in his commonest reason—impossible God; God being everywhere, and in us, and, indeed, us , in the God-lighted man; and impossible to be contemplated or known outside—being All !* ––––––––––– * [H. Jennings, op . cit ., chapter X, p. 81, in 5th rev. ed., 1870.] ––––––––––– 36  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS This is the teaching of the mediaeval Fire-Philosophers known as the Brothers of the Rosie-Cr o ss, such as Paracelsus, Khunrath, Van Helmont, and that of all the Illuminati and Alchemists who succeeded these, and who claimed to have discovered the eternal Fire, or to have “found out God in the Immortal Light”—that Light whose radiance shone through the Yogis. The same author remarks of them: Already, in their determined climbing unto the heights of thought, had these Titans of mind achieved, past the cosmical, through the shadowy borders of Real and Unreal, into Magic. For, is Magic wholly false? —he goes on to ask. No; certainly not, when by magic is understood the higher study of divine, an d yet not supernatural law, though the latter be, as yet, undiscovered by exact and materialistic science. No more are the so-called Spiritualistic phenomena which are believed in by nearly twenty millions of well-educated, often highly enlightened and learned persons in Europe"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"and America, but mere hallucinations of a diseased brain. They are as real, and as well authenticated by the testimony of thousands of unimpeached witnesses, and as scientifically and mathematically proved as the latest discoveries of our Brother T. A.

Je n nings, op . cit ., 1870, p. 83]. ––––––––––– MAGIC   37 be called “fools” were we even firm orthodox spiritualists ourselves— i . e ., belie v ers in perambulating ghosts and materialized bhûts— which we are not. But we are believers in the phenomena of the Spiritualists (even if we do doubt their “spirits”), for we happen to know them to be actual facts. It is one thing to reject unproved theory and quite another to battle against well-established facts. Everyone has a right to doubt until further and stronger evidence whether these modern phenomena which are inundating the Western countries, are all produced by disembodied “spirits,” for it happens to be hitherto a mere speculative doctrine raised up by enthusiasts; but no one is authorized—unless he can bring to contradict the fact, something better and weightier than the mere negations of sceptics, to deny that such phenomena do occur. If we, Theosophists (and a very small minority of us), disclaim the agency of “spirits” in such manifestations, it is because we can prove in most instances to the spiritualists, that many of their phenomena whether of physical or psychological nature, can be reproduced by some of our adepts at will, and without any aid of “spirits” or resort to either divine or diabolical miracle, but simply by developing the occult powers of the man’s Inner Self and studying the mysteries of nature. That European and American sceptics should deny such interference by spirits, and, as a consequence discredit the phenomena themselves, is no cause for wonder. Scarcely liberated from the clutches of the Church, whose terrible policy, barely a century ago, was to torture and put to death, every person who either doubted biblical, “divine” miracle, or endorsed one which theology declared diabolical, it is but the natural force of reaction which makes them revel in their new-found liberty of thought and action. One who denies the Supreme and the existence of his own soul is not likely to believe in either spirits or phenomena without abundant proof. But that Eastern people, Hindus especially of any sect, should disbelieve, is indeed an anomaly, considering that they all are taught the transmigration of souls, and spiritual as well as physical evolution. The sixteenth chapter of the Mahâbhârata, Harivanśa P arva ,"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 38  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS is full of spiritual phenomena and the raising of spirits. And if, ashamed of the now termed “supers t itions” of their forefathers, young India turns, sunflower-like, but to the great Luminaries of the West, this is what one of the most renowned men of Science of England, A. R. Wallace—a Fellow of the Royal as well as a member of the Theosophical Society—says of the phenomena in his Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection , and On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism , thus confirming the belief of old India: Up to the time when I first became acquainted with the facts of Spiritualism, I was a confirmed philosophical sceptic . . . I was so thorough and confirmed a materialist, that I could not at that time find a place in my mind for the conception of spiritual existence, or for any other agencies in the universe than matter and force. Facts, however, are stubborn things. Having explained how he came to become a Spiritualist, he considers the spiritual theory a n d shows its compatibility with natural selection. Having, he says: . . . been led, by a strict induction from facts, to a belief—firstly, in the existence of a number of preter-human intelligences of various grades; and secondly, that some of these intelligences, although usually invisible and intangible to us, can and do act on matter, and do influence our minds—I am surely following a strictly logical and scientific course, in seeing how far this doctrine will enable us to account for some of those residual phenomena which Natural Selection alone will not explain. In the tenth chapter of my Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection I have pointed out what I consider to be some of these residual phenomena; and I have suggested that they may be due to the action of some of the various intelligences above referred to . I maintained, and still maintain, that this view is one which is logically tenable, and is in no way inconsistent with a thorough acceptance of the grand doctrine of evolution through Natural Selection. Would not one think he hears in the above the voices of Manu, Kapila and many other philosophers of old India, in their teachings about the creation, evolution and growth of our planet and its living world of animal as well as human species? Does the great modern scientist speak less of “spirits” and spiritual beings than Manu, the antediluvian scientist and prehistoric legislator? Let young and MAGIC   39 sceptical India read and compare the old Âryan ideas with those of modern mystics, theosop h ists, spiritualists, and a few great scientists, and then laugh at the superstitious theories of both. For four years we have been fighting out our great battle against tremendous odds. We have been abused and called traitors by the spiritualists, for believing in other beings in the invisible world besides their departed spirits; we were cursed and sentenced to eternal damnation, with free passports to hell, by the Christians and their clergy; ridiculed by sceptics, looked upon as audacious lunatics by society, and tabooed by the conservative Press. We thought we had drunk to the dregs the bitter cup of gall. We had hoped that at"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"least in India, the country par excellence of psychological and metaphysical science, we would find firm ground for our weary feet. But lo! here comes a brother of ours who, without even taking the trouble to ascertain whether or not the rumours about us were true, makes haste to repudiate us in case we do believe in either Magic or Spiritualism! Well. We impose ourselves upon no one. For more than four years we lived and waxed in power if not in wisdom—which latter our humble deputation of Theosophists was sent to search for here, so that we might impart “Vedic learning and philosophy” to the millions of famished souls in the West, who are familiar with phenomena, but wrongly suffer themselves to be misled through their mistaken notions about Ghosts and Bhûts . But if we are to be repulsed at the outset by any considerable party of Ârya Samâjists, who share the views of “A Member,” then will the Theosophical Society, with its 45,000 or so of Western Spiritualists, have to become again a distinct and independent body, and do as well as it can without a single “member” to enlighten it on the absurdity of Spiritualism and Magic.

Mr. Harichandra Chintamon deducted from the said sum 42  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS of Rs. 609-3-4, 53 rupees and 12 annas for the following expenditures to Ârya Samaj: Postage p er letters written by him to America Rs. a. 15 0 Telegram to New York addressed by him to me 26 4 Hire of chairs for the meeting of the Samaj after our arrival in Bombay . . . . . . . . . . . 12 8  Total . . . . . . . . . . . 53 12 As to the list of things, that were given by the New York Theosophists to Mr. Harichandra Chintamon as President of the Samaj, they desired to join, I can only satisfy you as to those things that I handed to him personally. There were photographic portraits of fellows both of America and England who had sent their likeness to their brothers of the Ârya Samaj and had all written on the back of the cards to that effect, professing their faith and signing their names. If I mistake not, there were five or six of these, namely D. H. J. Billing, Mrs. Billing, C. C. Massey, President of the London Branch, Rev. Dr. Ayton, Palmer Thomas, W. Q.

H. Sumangala and the Rev. Mohottiwatte Gunananda. “They look queer,” he remarks, “to say the least, when decked in Christian prefixes ” (the italics are mine). He wants to know what his “right reverendship,” the Bishop of Lincoln, “would say to the yellow-robed, shaven-headed, and bare-shouldered priests of Gautama Buddha being so described.” I do sincerely hope that his “Right Reverendship,” unless he has quite forgotten his Johnson, and never consulted Webster, would have very little, if anything, to say about it. Unless the world at large, and the two great lexicographers in particular, have all this time been labouring under a delusion, the title of Reverend is derived from the Latin reverere , “to regard one with fear mingled with respect and affection” (Webster); or, perhaps Coleridge comes nearer to the mark in saying that “reverence” is “the synthesis of love and fear.” However this may be, I want to be informed whether this title is, in fact, purely a “Christian prefix” and why the yellow-robed, shaven-headed, and bare-shouldered priests of ∠ akya Muni have not as legitimate a right to it, whether in their own language or in English, as the black-robed, tonsured and surpliced “Lamas of Jehovah” (see Abbé Huc’s Travels in Thibet ) * and other padris of the multitudinous sects of Christendom. The Jews—to quote the immortal rejoinder of a Californian John Chinaman—“killed the joss of the Christians,” and yet no bigoted newspaper, clergyman or layman has ever questioned"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"the right of Jewish rabbis to the title of “Reverend.” The etymological side of the question being thus disposed of, it then appears to me that the priest of any religion, whether Buddhist, Hindoo, Mussulman or any other, ––––––––––– * Souven ir s d’un voyage dans la Tartarie, le Thibet, et la Chine pendant les années 1844, 1845, et 1846 .

Vice versa no cassocked or white-cravated priest or padri can be made “reverend” by simply affixing the title, if his secret life is one that shames morality and outrages common decency. Therefore, as we have yet to learn that our Brothers in Theosophy, Messrs. Sumangala and M. Gunananda, are less worthily styled “reverend” than the highest among the Christian clergy, we beg leave to protest against this insult. Let our critic, if he can, prove by the statistics of Ceylon, that that “spicy” isle has ever been the theatre of such disgraceful clerical crimes among the “heathen” and such shameful trials as have of late years rung throughout Christian America, not to say all Christendom. I need not go outside the law courts for statistics. Liar, embezzler, adulterer, poisoner, forger, seducer, incendiary, hypocrite—these are the “affixes” which the law has branded upon foreheads of many Christian clergymen. I have made a collection of newspaper cuttings, the last three years, and speak by the book. I would like to know, therefore, if you will kindly ask the Bishop of Lincoln, whose feelings you seem so afraid of hurting, whether by the test of any morality whatever, New Testament included, our two Sinhalese exemplars of the noble ethics of ∠ akya Muni, are, in the opinion of his “right reverendship,” less worthy of reverence than, for instance—the American Rev. H. W. Beecher, who was proved adulterer and perjurer, and only saved from prison by a disagreement of the jury, under the pressure of the cleverest counsel in America. Or than the “right reverend” Samuel MacCroskey, Episcopal Bishop of Michigan, who last year seduced his thirteen-year old adopted daughter.

The Indian Christian Herald , in the number of April 4th (which unhappily has just now reached my eye), with a generosity peculiar to religious papers, filled two pages with pious abuse of our Society as a body. I gather from it, moreover, that the Friend of India had previously gone out of its way to vilify the Society, since the former paper observes that “the Theosophical Society has merited the epithets employed about it by the Friend of India .” To my everlasting confusion be it said, that I am guilty of the crime of not only never reading, but even so much as laying my eyes upon that last named veteran organ. Nor can any of our Theosophists be charged with abusing the precious privilege of reading the missionary journals, a considerable time having elapsed since each of us was weaned, and relinquished milk and water pap. Not that we shirk the somniferous task under the spur of necessity. Were not the proof of our present writing itself sufficient, I need only cite the case of the Bombay missionary organ, the Dnyanodaya , which, on the 17th ultimo, infamously libelled us, and on the 25th was forced by Col. Olcott’s solicitor, Mr. T H E T H E O SOPHISTS AND THEIR OPPONENTS 49 Turner, to write an ample apology in order to avoid a criminal prosecution for defamation of chara c ter. We regret now to see that while the truly good and pious writer of the Herald was able to rise to the level of Billingsgate, he would not (or dared not?) climb to the height of actionable slander. Truly prudence is a great virtue! Confronted, as we all have so often been, with the intolerant bigotry—religious “zeal” they call it—and puerile anathemas of the clerical “followers of the meek and lowly Jesus,” no Theosophist is surprised to find the peas from the Herald shooter rattling against his armour. It adds to the clatter, but no one is mortally hurt. And, after all, how natural, that the poor fellows who try to administer spiritual food to the benighted heathen much after the fashion of the Strassburg goose-fatteners, who thrust balls of meal down the throats of the captive birds, unmasticated, to swell their livers, should shake at the intrusion of Europeans who are ready to analyse for the heathen these scripture-balls they are asked to grease with blind faith and swallow without chewing! People like us, who would have the effrontery to claim for the “heathen” the same right to analyse the Bible, as the Christian clergy claim to analyse and even revile the sacred scriptures of other people, must of course be put down. And the very Christian Herald tries his hand. “Let us,” it says “without any"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"bias or prejudice reflect . . . about the Theosophical Society.” To profess “such a mortal hatred[?] for Christianity and its divine Founder, bespeaks of a moral degradation . . . scarcely equalled. . . .” The Theosophists “stultify and disgrace themselves by their unnatural pretentions and blasphemous statements. . . .” No one “can undertake to describe the moral degradation of persons [the Buddhist, Âryan, Jain, Pârsî, Hebrew and Mussulman Theosophists, included?] who can see nothing good in the Bible . . . “ and who “ought to remember that the Bible is not only a blessed book, but our book”!! The latter piece of presumptuous conceit cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed. Before I answer the preceding invectives I mean to demand a clear definition of this last 50  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS sentence, “our Book.” Whose Book? The Herald ’ s ? “ Our” must mean that; for the seven thick volumes of the Speaker ’ s Commentary on the Old Testament* show, that the possessive pronoun and the singular noun in question can no longer be used by Christians when speaking of the Bible. So numerous and glaring have been the mistakes and mistranslations detected by the forty divines of the Anglican Church, during their seven years’ revision of the Old Testament, that the London Quarterly Review (No. 294, April, 1879), the organ of the most extreme orthodoxy, is driven in despair to say: “The time has certainly passed when the whole Bible could be practically esteemed a single book , miraculously communicated in successive portions from heaven, put into writing no doubt by human hands, but at the dictation of the divine spirit.” So we see beyond question that if it is anybody’s “Book” it must be the Indian Christian Herald ’ s ; for, in fact, its editors add: “We feel it to be no more a collection of books, but the book.” But here is another bitter pill for your contemporary. “The words,” it says in a pious gush, “which had come from the prophets of the despised Israel have been the life-blood of the world’s devotion”; but the inexorable Quarterly reviewer, after reluctantly abandoning to the analytical scalpels of Canon Cook and Bishop Harold Browne the Mosaic miracles whose supernatural character is no longer affirmed, but allowed to be “natural phenomena,” turns to the pretended Old Testament prophecies of Christ, and sadly says: “in the poetical (Psalms and Songs) and the prophetical books especially the number of corrections is enormous”; and shows how the commentators upon Isaiah and the other so-called prophets have reluctantly admitted that the timeworn verses which have been made to serve as predictive ––––––––––– * The Bib le , according to the authorized version (A.D. 1611) with an explanatory and critical commentary and a revision of the translation, by bishops and other clergy of the Anglican Church .

But it is just this that the critical expositor is bound to do . . . for this, some courage is required, for the result is apt to seem like a disenchantment for the worse, a descent to an inferior level, a profanation of the paradise in which ardent souls have found spiritual sustenance and delight.” (Such “souls” as the Herald editor’s?) What wonder, then, that the explosion of these seven theological torpedoes—as the seven volumes of the Speaker ’ s Commentary may truly be called—should force the reviewer into saying: “To us, we confess, every attempt to place the older Scriptures on the same supreme pinnacle on which the New Testament stands, leads inevitably to a disparagement of the later Revelation”? The Herald is welcome to what is left of its “Book.” How childishly absurd it was then of the Herald to make a whole Society the scapegoat for the sins of one individual! It is now universally known that the Society comprises fellows of many nationalities and many different religious faiths; and that its Council is made up of the representatives of these faiths. Yet the Herald endorses the falsehood that the Society’s principles are “a strange compound of Paganism and Atheism,” and its creed, “a creed as comprehensive as it is incomprehensible.” What other answer does this calumny require than the fact that our president has publicly declared that it had “no creed to offer for the world’s acceptance,” and that in the VIIIth Article of the Society’s Rules— appended to the printed Address—in an enumeration of the plans of the Society, the first paragraph says that it aims “to keep alive in man his belief that he has a soul, and the Universe a God.” If this is a “compound of Paganism and Atheism,” then let the Herald make the most of it. But the Society is not the real offender; the clerical stones are thrown into my garden. The Herald ’ s quotation of an expression used by me in commenting upon a passage of Sir John Kaye’s History of the Sepoy War , making the 52   BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Friend of India and Co. primarily responsible for that bloody tragedy, shows the whole animus. I t was I who said (see Indian Spectator , March 2nd), that “India owes everything to the British Government and not to Christianity” —i . e ., to missionaries. I may have lost my “senses outright,” as the Indian Christian Herald politely remarks, but I think I have enough left to see through the inane sophistries which they make do duty for arguments. We have only to say to the Herald the following: (1) It is just because we do live in “an age of enlightenment and progress,” in which there is or should be room for every form of belief, that such Augustinian tirades as the Herald ’ s are out of place. (2) We have not a “mortal hatred for Christianity and its Divine Founder”;—for the tendency of the Society is to emancipate its fellows from all hatred or preference for any one exoteric form of religion, i . e ., with more of the human than divine element in it—over another (see rules); neither can we hate a “Founder” whom the majority of us do not believe to have ever existed. (3) To"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"“retain” a “reverence for the Bible” one must at some time have had it; and if our own investigations had not long since convinced us that the Bible was no more the “Word of God” than half a dozen other holy Books, the present conclusions of the Anglican divines—at least as far as the Old Testament is concerned—would have removed the last vestige of doubt upon that point. And besides sundry American clergymen and Bishops, we have among our Fellows a vicar of the Church of England, who is one of its most learned antiquarians. (4) The assertion that the “pure monotheism of the Vedas is a pure myth”—is a pure falsehood—besides being an insult to Max Müller and other Western Orientalists who have proved the fact, to say nothing of that great Âryan scholar, preacher and reformer, Svâmi Dyanand Sarasvati. “Degraded humanity” that we are, there must be indeed “something radically wrong and corrupt” in our “moral nature,” for, we confess to a joy at seeing our Society constantly growing from accessions of some of the most influential laymen of different countries. And it moreover THE THE O SOPHISTS AND THEIR OPPONENTS  53 delights us to think that when we reach the bottom of the ditch we will have as bed-fellows half the C hristian clergy, if the Speaker ’ s Commentary makes as sad havoc with the divinity of the New Testament as it has with that of the Old. “How” exclaims our Indian Christian Pecksniff in righteous indignation, “how they managed to sink so low in the scale of moral and spiritual being must be a sadly interesting study for metaphysicians?” Sad indeed; but sadder still to reflect that unless the editors of the Indian Christian Herald are protected by post-mortem fire insurance policies, they are in danger themselves of eternal torment. . . . “Whosoever shall say to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire,” says Lord Jesus, “the Desire of nations,” in Matthew , v, 22, unless—dreadful thought!—this verse should be also found a mistranslation.

Secrétaire correspondant de la Société Théosophique, il est de mon devoir, pour les raisons ci-dessous mentionnées, de relever le gant jeté à notre Société; surtout, lorsque l’une de nos doctrines est qualifiée « d ’ erreur grave , triste et funeste dans ses conséquences » . Notre Société s’est fait connaître d’un bout du monde à l’autre, mais ses statuts et articles de foi sont totalement inconnus au public. J’en cite deux, que je traduis à peu près verbatim . « 1. Toute personne désirant de se faire accepter comme membre, doit, avant son initiation, signer un document ( a pledge of secrecy ), par lequel elle s’oblige, sur sa parole d ’ honneur , de garder le silence sur les expériences scientifiques de conseil, qu’elles soient du domaine physique ou psychologique, de ne les révéler à personne en dehors de la Société, à moins que la permission ne lui en soit donnée par le conseil suprême. 2. Tout membre jurera de défendre l’honneur de la Fraternité, ainsi que celui du plus pauvre et insignifiant de ses membres, aussi longtemps que ce dernier le méritera, et-cela, en cas de nécessité, au risque de la fortune et même de la vie du défenseur » . C’est au nom de notre Société entière que je réponds aux réflexions de M. de Justiniani, ce n’est pas à lui que nous répondons, mais bien au parti qu’il semble représenter, et qui, à en juger par les susdites « Réflexions » serait, si nous R ÉPONSE D ÉFINITIVE  57 n’avio n s la preuve du contraire, extrême dans son intolérance et—qu’on nous pardonne l’expre s sion— fanatique dans ses croyances. Envisageant la Société Théosophique à son point de vue, il juge notre philosophie, celle des Védas , par les renseignements qu’il a pu obtenir de l’occultisme traditionnel et oriental des « Mages et des Derviches » de son pays islamisé depuis des siècles; je ne m’étonne pas de voir M. de Justiniani traiter « Kapila, Patañjali, Kanâda, et tous les hiérophantes réunis » de l’Inde antique et moderne, avec un dédain aussi suprême. Celui qui n’a pas dans le cœur l’amour de l’humanité entière, amour qui n’a pas à considérer les différences de religions et de races, ne sympathisera jamais avec nous; s’il fait partie d’un corps social religieux, ou philosophique, et ne s’occupe que des seuls intérêts de la propagation de ses doctrines à lui; s’il les place au-dessus de toutes les"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"autres et cherche toujours à convertir l’univers entier à ses croyances spéciales, il ne peut rendre justice aux croyances d’autrui; tel est le Christianisme qui, se figeant dans le dogme, arrêta tout progrès scientifique pendant de longs siècles; ainsi encore, procéda l’Islamisme. Si le Spiritisme avait, parmi ses défenseurs, une majorité qui pensât comme l’auteur des « Dernières Réflexions » — il pourrait agir de même. M. R. de Justiniani ne fait pas exception à cette règle, cela est évident; tout en confessant ne rien connaître « aux système de l’ Aryâvarta » , il tient néanmoins à prouver qu’ils ne valent rien. La Science des magiciens (?) anciens et modernes, s’éclipse devant une seule expérience spiritualiste de l’éminent M. Crookes! Sait-il seulement que cet illustre savant, tout en croyant aux phénomènes de la matérialisation, autant que les théosophes qui comptent dans leurs rangs des hommes de mérites placés plus haut dans la hiérarchie de la Société Royale de Londres , qui ont vu des « Katie Kings » se matérialiser par douzaines, sait-il que cette grande autorité des Spiritualistes doute que ce soient les « Esprits » qui président au phénomènes de la matérialisation? . . . il faut de longs siècles à une vérité demontrée pour être acceptée et devenir le patrimoine commun si elle heurte les préjugés et contredit les superstitions populaires; 5 8  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS par cont re, tout paradoxal que soit un sophisme, il sera toujours reçu à bras ouverts, s’il flatte l e s idées préconçues et l’idole chérie des masses. M. de Justiniani connaît-il seulement le modus operandi employé par les théosophes lorsqu’il s’agit de phénomènes et d’investigations suivies? Est-il bien renseigné sur ce que nous acceptons et sur ce que nous rejetons? Nos idées sur la valeur du témoignage collectif et corroboratif, en fait de phénomènes, lui sont-elles familières? Il nous sera bien permis d’en douter, puisqu’il cherche à impressionner le lecteur avec cette idée que les théosophes n’ont qu’une « philosophie spéculative qui a fait son temps » , et que, ne pouvant fournir des faits , nous les remplaçons par un système ; il a cette idée originale qu’on peut « croire à Dieu, aux Esprits, à la vie future, sans cesser pour cela d’être positiviste » (?), « qu’un fait quel qu’il soit doit, avant tout, être mis dans la balance de l’expérience, pesé, touché, obtenu plusieurs fois pour être admis sans conteste » . — Ces réflexions nous font supposer que M. R. de Justiniani a trouvé quelque part les règlements de la Société Théosophique, puisqu’il cite deux de ses articles. Sans contredire ces axiomes, que nous prêchons depuis quatre ans, nous ferons observer à notre contradicteur qu’il se place sur un terrain dangereux, autant pour lui-même, que pour le parti qu’il veut représenter. « Mutato nomine , de te fabula narratur » . Les théosophes n’ont que faire de ces reproches, et certains spirites et spiritualistes crédules peuvent se les appliquer. Commentons ses dernières réflexions: Il est un peu difficile, de concilier l’idée du « Positivisme » avec la croyance « en Dieu , aux Esprits » et « à la vie future » . À l’exception du fameux Catéchisme positiviste d’Auguste Comte, nulle part nous n’avons trouvé rien d’aussi paradoxal. Un illustre savant Anglais surnomma un jour la nouvelle religion des"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"positivistes le « Catholicisme romain moins—le Christianisme » ; et voilà, qu’on nous prêche maintenant, une vie future, que les savants pourront analyser au creuset, et un « Dieu » qu’ils dissoudraient et cristalliseraient ad gustum ! Le Positivisme étant diamétralement l’opposé du RÉPONSE DÉ FINITIVE   59 Spirit u alisme, n’admet rien en dehors des sciences physiques et positives, il n’accepte que les faits constatés; je ne pense pas que, parmi les spirites, ceux qui ont des croyances poétiques, une doctrine abstraite et mystérieuse, consentent à dégrader leur consolante philosophie, en la plaçant au nombre des sciences physiques et positives. Toute philosophie, qu’elle s’appelle Spiritisme, Christianisme, Bouddhisme, ou Occultisme, doit nécessairement contenir des idées qui dépassent le domaine des faits physiquement demontrés, théories , qui, toutes logiques qu’elles soient, sont encore composées d’hypothèses et même de généralisations, en elles-mêmes plus que suffisantes pour les exclure à jamais du domaine des sciences positives. Notre estimable contradicteur oublie que ce sont précisément les sciences exactes, la géologie entre autres, qui ont donné le coup de grâce au Christianisme surnaturel avec tous ses miracles, et ce n’était point, je pense, pour tendre les bras grands ouverts au Spiritualisme. Donc, théorie pour théorie, système pour système, les idées des théosophes ont autant de droit à une place au soleil que celles des spirites et des spiritualistes. La seule différence qui existe entre nous, c’est que les spirites tels que M. de Justiniani se font esclaves de dogmes et d’idées préconçues et peuvent arrêter tout progrès possible dans les sciences psychologiques. Les théosophes qui « n’ont ni dogmes ni doctrines nouvelles à offrir » (statuts et lois de la Société) aident à ce progrès autant qu’il est en leur pouvoir, « ce sont de simples chercheurs , des investigateurs qui acceptent toute vérité démontrée » . Les « réflexions » de notre adversaire n’encouragent guère les théosophes, dont quelques uns ont eu l’honneur dernièrement, d’être admis par la « Société scientifique d’Études psychologiques » au nombre de ses membres honoraires—à aider leur F.E.C. dans leurs recherches. M. de Justiniani qui ne connait pas les « sublimes conceptions de Kapila . . . et Gautama . . . philosophes indous » , accuse, néanmoins, leurs descendants modernes, nos chefs indiens, « de faire fausse route en voulant imiter, en plain dix-neuvième siècle, les mystères de Cérès, d’Éleusines ou ceux de l’antre de 60  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS Trophon i us » , les théos ophes n’ont pas l’habitude de discuter, de nier ou de critiquer soit un système, un fait, ou une organisation scientifique qu’il n’ont pas étudié à fond.

Cependant, comme la science positive ne peut jamais aller au-delà de son domaine limité par nos sens physiques, elle se trouve condamnée à tourner éternellement à l’instar de l’écureuil sur sa roue, autour du fait physiquement démontré, tout en ayant réussi à prouver à l’aide de batteries électriques et autres apparats scientifiques, la réalité palpable du corps temporairement matériel de Miss Katie King.

ROSSI DE JUSTINIANI [ La Revue Spirite , Paris, September, 1879] [ Translation of the foregoing original French text ] The article entitled: “Final Reflexions of an Oriental,” which is addressed to me in the June number of La Revue Spirite , demands a reply. As Corresponding Secretary of the Theosophical Society, it is my duty, for reasons mentioned below, to pick up the gauntlet thrown at our Society; above all, when one of our teachings is qualified as “ a grave error , deplorable and disastrous in its consequences .” Our Society is known from one end of the earth to the other, but its statutes and articles of belief are quite unknown to the public. I will quote two of these, translated almost verbatim : “(1) . Every person desiring to be accepted as a member, must before his initiation sign a document ( a pledge of secrecy ), by which he is obliged, on his word of honor , to preserve silence on the scientific experiments of the Council, whether in the physical or the psychological domain, and not to reveal them to anyone outside the Society without permission being given to him by the Supreme Council. (2) . Every member will pledge himself to defend the honor of the Brotherhood and that of the poorest and most humble of its members so long as they deserve it, and that, in case of need, at the risk of the fortune and even of the life of the defender.” It is in the name of our whole Society that I reply to the reflexions of Mr. de Justiniani; we do not answer him but rather the party which he appears to represent F INAL R EPLY   63 and whi c h, to judge by the above-mentioned “Reflexions,” would be, if we had no proof to the contr ary, extreme in its intolerance and—if we may be pardoned the expression —fanatical in its beliefs. Envisaging the Theosophical Society from his point of view, he judges our philosophy, that of the Vedas , by the information he has been able to get of traditional and Oriental occultism from the “Magi and Dervishes” of his country which has been Islamic for centuries. I am not surprised to see Mr. de Justiniani treat “Kapila, Patañjali, Kanâda, and all the hierophants put together” of ancient and modern India with such supreme contempt. He who has no love in his heart for the whole of humanity, a love that pays no attention to the differences between religions and races, will never sympathize with us; if he makes a part of a social, religious or philosophic body and is interested only in the propagation of its own doctrines; if he puts them above all others, and ever seeks to"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"convert the whole universe to his special beliefs, he cannot do justice to the beliefs of others; such is Christianity which, fixed in dogma, arrested all scientific progress for long centuries—Islam acting the same way! If Spiritualism had among its defenders a majority which thought like the author of “Final Reflexions” it might act in a similar way also. Mr. R. de Justiniani makes no exception to this rule, it is evident; while fully confessing that he knows nothing “of the systems of Âryâvarta ,” he nevertheless tries to prove that they are worth nothing. The Science of the Magicians (?), ancient and modern, is eclipsed by a single Spiritualistic experience of the eminent Crookes! Does he even know that this illustrious scientist, believing in the phenomena of materialization as fully as the Theosophists who reckon in their ranks men of distinction standing higher in the hierarchies of the London Royal Society , who have seen “Katie Kings” materialize by the dozen, does he know that this great authority of the Spiritualists doubts that “ Spirits ” preside over the phenomena of materialization? . . . Long ages are needed for a demonstrated truth to be accepted and become the common patrimony, if it wounds prejudices and contradicts popular superstitions; on the contrary, 6 4  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS paradoxical as a sophism may be, it will always be received with open arms if it flatters the preconc e ived ideas and cherished idols of the masses. Does Mr. de Justiniani know even the modus operandi employed by Theosophists when phenomena and their investigations are concerned? Is he well informed as to what we accept and what we reject? Are our ideas about the value of collective and corroborative evidence in the matter of phenomena familiar to him? We must really be allowed to doubt it, since he tries to impress the reader with the idea that Theosophists have only a “ speculative philosophy which has had its day ,” and that, not being able to supply facts , we substitute them by a system ; he has the curious notion that one can “believe in God, in Spirits, in the future life, without ceasing for all that to be a Positivist ”(?), “that a fact, whatever it may be, must first of all be placed in the balance of experience, weighed, calculated, touched, repeated several times, before being accepted without dispute”—these reflexions make us imagine that Mr. R. de Justiniani has discovered somewhere the Rules of the Theosophical Society, since he quotes two of their articles. Without contradicting these axioms, which we have been preaching for four years, we would mention to our opponent that he is standing on dangerous ground, as much for himself as for the party he would represent. “ Mutato nomine , de te fabula narratur .” Theosophists are not concerned with these accusations but certain credulous Spiritists and Spiritualists might well apply them to themselves. Let us comment upon his last reflexions. It is rather difficult to harmonize the idea of “ Positivism ” with the belief “ in God , in Spirits ,” and “ in the future life .” With the exception of the famous Catéchisme positiviste of Auguste Comte, nowhere have we found anything so paradoxical. An illustrious English scientist once surnamed the new religion of the Positivists “Roman Catholicism minus—Christianity”; and now they preach to us a future"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"life that the scientists can analyze in their crucibles, and a “God” that they would dissolve and crystallize ad gustum ! Positivism being diametrically opposed to Spiritualism admits nothing F INAL R EPLY   65 beyond t he physical and positive sciences, it only accepts established facts and demonstrated laws; I d o not think that, among the Spiritists, those who have poetical beliefs, and hold to an abstract and mysterious doctrine, would agree to the degradation of their consoling philosophy by letting it be placed among the physical and positive sciences. Every philosophy, be it called Spiritism, Christianity, Buddhism or Occultism, must necessarily contain ideas that extend beyond the domain of facts demonstrated physically ; theories , which logical though they be, are yet composed of hypotheses, and even of generalisations, in themselves more than sufficient to exclude them for ever from the domain of the positive sciences. Our estimable contradictor forgets that it is precisely the exact sciences—geology among others—that have given the death-blow to supernatural Christianity with all its miracles, and I fancy this was not done in order to welcome Spiritualism with open arms. Thus, theory for theory, system for system, the ideas of the Theosophists have as much right to a place in the sun as those of the Spiritists and the Spiritualists. The only difference that exists between us is that Spiritists such as Mr. de Justiniani are enslaved by dogmas and preconceived ideas and are able to arrest all possible progress in psychological sciences. The Theosophists who “have neither dogmas nor doctrines to offer” (statutes and rules of the Society), help this progress along, as much as they are able to; “ they are merely seekers , investigators who accept any demonstrated truth.” The “reflexions” of our adversary hardly encourage Theosophists, of whom some have lately had the honour of being admitted by the “Scientific Society of Psychological Studies” to the number of its honorary members—to help their F.E.C. in their researches. Mr. de Justiniani, who does not know the “sublime conceptions of Kapila . . . and Gautama . . . Hindu philosophers,” nevertheless accuses their modern representatives, our Indian Chiefs, “of taking the wrong direction in wishing to imitate, in this Nineteenth Century, the mysteries of Ceres, of Eleusis, or those of the Cave of Trophonius.” Theosophists are not in the 66  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS habit of discussing, denying, or criticizing either a system, a fact, or a scientific organization that the y have not studied to its foundations. Not believing anything a priori , but at the same time admitting the possibility of the most marvelous facts in nature, studying, seeking, comparing all systems, all philosophies, as well as all opinions, never rejecting one before having perfectly understood and analyzed it, they accept nothing in the name of faith , not even the statements of the eminent Mr. Crookes of the Royal Society; they do not yield to"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"evidence except when experimental science has explained a phenomenon rationally to them. However, as positive science can never go beyond its domain, which is limited by our physical senses, it finds itself condemned to turn for ever, like the squirrel on its wheel, around the physically demonstrated fact, although it has succeeded in proving the palpable reality of the temporarily material body of Miss Katie King by means of electric batteries and other scientific apparatus. Mr. Crookes, in spite of all his eminence, has been, so far, incapable of proving to us in a conclusive manner that the soul of that charming daughter of the Air belongs to the class of the spirits of the incarnated, rather than to that of the sublunary sylphs; to the “angels” of the Spiritualists and not to the devils of Mr. de Mirville; the question remains “ adhuc sub judice lis est ” as they say in court.* We propose to prove in our next article that the oracles that came from the modern “Cave of Trophonius” are everywhere capable of rivalling those of the mediums, and even surpassing them on occasion. For the present it is time to close this epistle which is already too long, and we will do so by adding these few words. Certain as we are to find the great majority of our Spiritist readers less intolerant and above all less inclined to criticize that of which they do not know the first word, we will hasten to let them know the results of our latest studies and researches in India. The marvels that one can see there are but feebly delineated by Mr. L. J.

As to your amiable correspondent from Smyrna, after having read his “Reflex i ons” and pondered over his final, unequivocal, and formal declaration, it is clear that all argument with him becoming impossible, the debate is closed; after having invited us with a generosity—of which we are quite unworthy—to open the gates of our sanctuary as widely as possible to him, and to unveil all our teachings by degrees, he warns us frankly that every proof we could offer him would be useless. He would reject “ everything that is not in harmony with reason ( his own reason) and is contrary to human conscience .” It is obvious that Theosophists, in believing what Mr. de Justiniani’s conscience rejects, may be denied the privilege of having one. “If they [the Theosophists] even succeed some day in making us witness the annihilation of the self in the most depraved nature, they can be sure that we will not believe it,” adds our Smyrna correspondent, who may remain calm. We are discreet, and—we will try to save him from the sad necessity of giving us the lie. H. P. B LAVATSKY. Bombay, 28 th June .

[ Banner of Light , Boston, Vol. XLVI, No. 4, October 18, 1879, p. 7] To the Editor of the Banner of Light . Phenom e na in India—beside the undoubted interest they offer in themselves, and apart from their great variety and in most instances utter dissimilarity from those we are accustomed to hear of in Europe and America—possess another feature which makes them worthy of the most serious attention of the investigator of psychology. Whether Eastern phenomena are to be accounted for by the immediate and sole interference and help of the spirits of the departed, or attributed to some other and hitherto unknown cause, is a question which, for the present, we will leave aside. It can be discussed, with some degree of confidence, only after many instances have been carefully noted and submitted, in all their truthful and unexaggerated details, to an impartial and unprejudiced public. One thing I beg to reaffirm, and this is, that instead of exacting the usual “conditions” of darkness, harmonious circles, and nevertheless leaving the witnesses uncertain as to the expected results, Indian phenomena, if we except the independent apparitions of bhûts (ghosts of the dead), are never sporadic and spontaneous, but seem to depend entirely upon the will of the operator, whether he be a holy Hindu Yogi, a Mussulman Sâdhu, fakir, or yet a juggling Jadugar (sorcerer). In this series of letters I mean to present numerous examples of what I here say; for, whether we read of the seemingly supernatural feats produced by the Rishis , the E CHOES FROM I NDIA  69 Aryan p a triarchs of Archaic antiquity, or by the Achâryas of the Puranic days, or hear of them fro m popular traditions, or again see them repeated in our modern times, we always find such phenomena of the most varied character. Besides covering the whole range of those known to us through modern mediumistic agency, as well as repeating the mediaeval pranks of the nuns of Loudun and other historical posédées in cases of “bhût” obsession, we often recognize in them the exact counterparts—as once upon a time they must have been the originals— of Biblical miracles. With the exception of two—those over which the world of piety goes most in raptures while glorifying the Lord, and the world of scepticism grins most sardonically—to wit, the anti-heliocentric crime performed by Joshua, and Jonah’s unpleasant excursion into the slimy cavern of the whale’s belly—we have to record nearly everyone of the feats which are said to have so distinguished Moses and other “friends of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"God,” as occasionally taking place in India. But alas, for those venerable jugglers of Judaea! And alas for those pious souls who have hitherto exalted these alleged prophets of the forthcoming Christ to such a towering eminence! The idols have just been all but knocked off their pedestals by the parricidal hands of the forty divines of the Anglican Church, who now are known to have sorely disparaged the Jewish Scriptures. The despairing cry raised by the reviewer of the just issued Commentary on the “Holy” Bible, in the most extreme organ of orthodoxy (the London Quarterly Review for April, 1879), is only matched by his meek submission to the inevitable . The fact I am alluding to is one already known to you, for I speak of the decision and final conclusive opinions upon the worth of the Bible by the conclave of learned Bishops who have been engaged for the last dozen of years on a thorough revision of the Old Testament. The results of this labour of love may be summarized thus: 1. The shrinkage of the Mosaic and other “miracles” into mere natural phenomena. (See decisio n s of Canon Cook, the Queen’s Chaplain, and Bishop Harold Browne.) 70  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS 2. The rejection of most of the alleged prophecies of Christ as such; the said prophecies now turn i ng out to have related simply to contemporaneous events in the Jewish national history. 3. Resolution to place no more the Old Testament on the same eminence as the Gospels, as it would inevitably lead to the “disparagement” of the new one. 4. The sad confession that the Mosaic Books do not contain one word about a future life , and the just complaint that: “Moses under divine direction [?] should have abstained from any recognition of man’s destiny beyond the grave, while the belief was prominent in all the religions around Israel,” . . . is “ confessed to be one of those enigmas which are the trial of our faith .” And it is the “trial” of our American missionaries here also. Educated natives all read the English p a pers and magazines, and it now becomes harder than ever to convince these “heathen” matriculates of the “sublime truths” of Christianity. But this by the way of a small parenthesis; for I mention these newly evolved facts only as having an important bearing upon Spiritualism in general, and its phenomena especially. Spiritualists have always taken such pains to identify their manifestations with the Bible miracles, that such a decision, coming from witnesses certainly more prejudiced in favour of, than opposed to, “miracles” and divine supernal phenomena, is rather a new and unexpected difficulty in our way. Let us hope that in view of these new religious developments, our esteemed friend, Dr. Peebles, before committing himself too far to the establishment of “independent Christian churches,” will wait for further ecclesiastical verdicts, and see how the iconoclastic English divines will overhaul the phenomena of the New Testament. Maybe, if their consistency does not evaporate, they will have to attribute all the miracles worked by Jesus also to “natural phenomena”! Very happily for Spiritualists, and for Theosophists likewise, the phenomena of the nineteenth century cannot be as easily disposed of as those of the Bible. We have had"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"to take the latter for nearly two thousand E CHOES FROM I NDIA  71 years o n mere blind faith, though but too often they transcended every possible law of nature, w h ile quite the reverse is our case, and we can offer facts . But to return. If manifestations of occult nature of the most various character may be said to abound in India, on the other hand, the frequent statements of Dr. Peebles to the effect that this country is full of native Spiritualists, are —how shall I say it?—a little too hasty, and exaggerated. Disputing this point in the London Spiritualist of January 18th, 1878, with a Madras gentleman, now residing in New York, he maintained his position in the following words: “I have met not only Sinhalese and Chinese Spiritualists, but hundreds of Hindu Spiritualists, gifted with the powers of conscious mediumship. And yet Mr. W. L. D. O’Grady, of New York, informs the readers of The Spiritualist (see issue November 23rd) that there are no Hindu Spiritualists. These are his words—‘No Hindu is a Spiritualist’.” And, as an offset to this assertion, Dr. Peebles quotes from the letter of an esteemed Hindu gentleman, Mr. Peary Chand Mitra, of Calcutta, a few words to the effect that he blesses God that his “inner vision is being more and more developed,” and he talks “with spirits.” We all know that Mr. Mitra is a Spiritualist, but what does it prove? Would Dr. Peebles be justified in stating that because H. P. Blavatsky and half a dozen of other Russians have become Buddhists and Vedantists, Russia is full of Buddhists and Vedantists? There may be, in India, a few Spiritualists among the educated reading classes, scattered far and wide over the country, but I seriously doubt whether our esteemed opponent could easily find a dozen of such among this population numbering 240,000,000. There are solitary exceptions, but exceptions only go to strengthen a rule, as everyone knows. Owing to the rapid spread of Spiritualistic doctrines the world over, and to my having left India several years before, at the time I was in America I abstained from contradicting in print the great Spiritualistic “pilgrim” and philosopher, surprising as such statements seemed to me, who thought myself pretty well acquainted with this country. 72  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS India, un progressive as it is, I thought might have changed, and I was not sure of my facts. But now t h at I have returned for the fourth time to this country, and have had over five months’ residence in it, a careful investigation into the phenomena, and especially into the opinions held by the people on this subject, and seven weeks of travelling all over the country, mainly for the purpose of seeing and investigating every kind of manifestations, I must be allowed to know what I am talking about, as I speak by the book. Mr. O’Grady was right: “No Hindu is a Spiritualist” in the sense in which we all understand the term. And I am now ready to prove, if need be, by dozens of letters from the most trustworthy natives, who are educated by Brahmans, and know the religious and superstitious views of their"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"countrymen better than any one of us, that whatever else Hindus may be termed, it is not Spiritualists . “What constitutes a Spiritualist?” very pertinently inquires, in a London Spiritual organ, a correspondent with “a passion for definition” (see Spiritualist , June 13th, 1879), and then, after asking, “Is Mr. Crookes a Spiritualist, who, like my humble self, does not believe in spirits of the dead as agents in the phenomena?” he brings forward several definitions, “from the most latitudinarian to the most restricted definitions,” as he expresses it. Let us see to which of these “definitions” the “Spiritualism” of the Hindus—I will not say of the mass, but even of a majority—would answer. Since Dr. Peebles, during his two short visits to India, and while on his way from Madras, crossing it in its diameter from Calcutta to Bombay, could meet “hundreds of Spiritualists,” then these must indeed form, if not the majority, at least a considerable percentage of the 240,000,000, of India. I will now quote the definitions from the letter of the inquirer, who signs himself “A Spiritualist” (?), and [add] my own remarks thereupon: A. “Every one is a Spiritualist who believes in the immortality of the soul.” I guess not; otherwise the whole of Christian Europe and America would be Spiritualists; nor does this definition, A, answer to the religious views of the Hindus of any sect, for, while the ignorant masses believe E CHOES FROM I NDIA   73 [in] an d aspire to Moksha, i . e ., litera l absorption of the spirit of man in that of Brahma, or loss of individual immortality , as means of avoiding the punishment and horrors of transmigration, the philosophers, adepts, and learned Yogis, such as our venerated master, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the great Hindu reformer, Sanskrit scholar, and Supreme Chief of the Vedic Section of the Eastern Division of the Theosophical Society, explain the future state of man’s spirit, its progress and evolution, in terms diametrically opposite to the views of the Spiritualists. These views, if agreeable, I will give in some future letter. B. “Any one who believes that the continued conscious existence of deceased persons has been demonstrated by communication is a Spiritualist.” A Hindu, whether an erudite scholar and philosopher or an ignorant idolater, does not believe in “continued conscious existence,” though the former assigns for the holy, sinless soul, which has reached Svarga (heaven) and Moksha, a period of many millions and quadrillions of years, extending from one Pralaya* to the next. The Hindu believes in cyclic transmigrations of the soul, during which there must be periods when the soul loses its recollections as well as the consciousness of its individuality, since, if it were otherwise, every person would distinctly remember all his previous existences, which is not the case. Hindu philosophies are likewise consistent with logic. They at least will not allow an endless eternity of either reward or punishment for a few dozens of years of earthly life, be this life wholly blameless or yet wholly sinful. –––––––––– * F o r th e meaning of the word Pralaya see Vol. II, p. 424, of Isis Unveiled . I am happy to say, that"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"notwithstanding the satirical criticisms upon its Vedic and Buddhistic portions by some American “would-be” Orientalists, Swami Dayânand and the Rev. Sumangala of Ceylon, respectively the representatives of Vedic and Buddhistic scholarship and literature in India—the first, the best Sanskrit, and the other, the most eminent Pâli scholar, both expressed their entire satisfaction with the correctness of my esoteric explanations of their respective religions. Isis Unveiled is now being translated into Marâthî and Hindi in India, and into Pâli in Ceylon. –––––––––– 74  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS C. “Anyone is a Spiritualist who believes in any of the alleged objective phenomena, whateve r theory he may favour about them, or even if he have none at all.” This definition is a totally wrong one. Such persons are “Phenomenalists,” not Spiritualists, and in this sense it answers to Hindu beliefs. All of them, even those who, aping the modern school of Atheism, declare themselves materialists, are yet phenomenalists in their hearts, if one only sounds them. (D.) E. “Does not allow of Spiritualism without spirits, but the spirits need not be human.” At this rate Theosophists and Occultists generally may also be called Spiritualists, though the latter regard them as enemies; and in this sense only all Hindus are Spiritualists, though their ideas about human spirits are diametrically opposed to those of the Spiritualists. They regard “bhûts”—which are the spirits of those who died with unsatisfied desires, and who, on account of their sins and earthly attractions, are earth-bound and kept back from Svarga (the “Elementaries” of the Theosophists)—as having become wicked devils, liable to be annihilated any day under the potent curses of the Brahman exorciser. The “spiritual control” so much sought for and appreciated in mediums, the Hindu regards as the greatest curse a person can be afflicted with—possession and obsession by a bhût , and the most loving couples often part if the wife is attacked by the bhût of a relative, who, it seems, seldom or never attacks any but women. (F.) G. “Consider that no one has a right to call himself a Spiritualist who has any new-fangled notions about ‘elementaries,’ ‘spirit of the medium,’ and so forth; or does not believe that departed human spirits, high and low, account for all the phenomena of every description.” This one is the most proper and correct of all the above given “definitions,” from the standpoint of orthodox Spiritualism, and settles our dispute with Dr. Peebles. No Hindu, were it even possible to bring him to regard bhûts as low, suffering spirits on their way to progress and final pardon(?), could, even if he would, account for all the phenomena on this true Spiritualistic theory. His religious and ECHOES F ROM INDIA   75 philosophical traditions are all opposed to such a limited idea. A Hindu is, first of all, a born metaphy s ician and logician. If he believes at all, and in whatever he believes, he will admit of no special laws called into existence for men of this planet alone, but will apply these"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"laws throughout the universe; for he is a Pantheist before being anything else, and notwithstanding his possible adherence to some special sect. Thus Dr. Peebles has well defined the situation himself, in the following happy paradox, in his Spiritualist letter above quoted, and in which he says: “Some of the best mediums that it has been my good fortune to know, I met in Ceylon and India. And these were not mediums; for, indeed, they held converse with the ‘ Pays and Piśachas , havi ng their habitations in the air, the water, the fire, in ro c ks and trees, in the clouds, the rain, the dew, in mines and caverns’.” Thus these “mediums” who were not mediums , were no more Spiritualists than they were mediums, and—the house (Dr. Peebles’ house) is divided against itself and—must fall. So far we agree, and I will now proceed further on with my proofs. As I mentioned before, Colonel Olcott and myself, accompanied by a Hindu gentleman, Mr. Mulji Thackersing, a member of our Council, started on our seven weeks’ journey early in April. Our object was two-fold: (1) To pay a visit to and remain for some time with our ally and teacher, Swami Dayanand, with whom we had corresponded so long from America, and thus consolidate the alliance of our Society with the Ârya Samâjes of India (of which there are now over fifty); and (2) see as much of the phenomena as we possibly could; and, through the help of our Swami—a Yogi himself and an Initiate into the mysteries of the Vidya (or secret sciences)—settle certain vexed questions as to the agencies and powers at work, at first hand. Certainly no one could find a better opportunity to do so than we had. There we were, on friendly relations of master and pupils with Pandit Dayanand, the most learned man in India, a Brahman of high caste, and one who had for seven long years undergone the usual and 7 6   BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS dreary probations of Yogism in a mountainous and wild region, in solitude, in a state of complete n udity, and constant battle with elements and wild beasts—the battle of divine human Spirit and imperial WILL of man against gross and blind matter in the shape of tigers, leopards , r hinoceroses and bears, without mentioning venomous snakes and scorpions. The inhabitants of the village nearest to that mountain are there to certify that sometimes for weeks no one would venture to take a little food—a handful of rice —to our Swami; and yet, whenever they came, they always found him in the same posture and on the same spot—an open, sandy hillock, surrounded by thick jungle full of beasts of prey—and apparently as well without food and water for whole weeks, as if he were made of stone instead of human flesh and bones.* He has explained to us this mysterious secret which enables man to suffer and conquer at last the most cruel privations; which permits him to go without food or drink for days and weeks; to become utterly insensible to the extremes of either heat or cold, and, finally, to live for days outside instead of within his body . . . During this voyage we visited the very cradle of Indian mysticism, the hot-bed of ascetics, where the remembrance of the wondrous phenomena performed by the Rishis of old is now as fresh as it ever was during those days when the School of Patañjali—the reputed founder of Yogism—was filled, and where his Yog-Sânkhya is still studied with as"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"much fervour, if not with the same powers of comprehension. To Upper India and the North-Western Provinces we went; to Allahabad and Cawnpore, with the shores of their sacred “Gangâ” (Ganges) all studded with devotees; whither the latter, when disgusted with life, proceed to pass the remainder of their days in meditation and –––––––––– * Yogis a nd ascetics are not the only examples of such protracted fastings; for if these can be doubted and sometimes utterly rejected by sceptical science as void of any conclusive proof—for the phenomenon takes place in remote and inaccessible places—we have many of the Jainas , inhabitants of populated towns, to bring forward as exemplars of the same. Many of them fast, abstaining even from one drop of water for forty days at a time—and survive always. –––––––––– E CHOES FROM I NDIA  77 seclus i on, and become Sannyâsis, Gosains, Sâdhus. Thence to Agra, with its Taj Mahal, “the poem in m a rble,” as Bishop Heber happily called it; and the tomb of its founder, the great Emperor-Adept, Akbar, at Sikandra; to Agra, with its temples crowded with ® akti-worshippers, and to that spot, famous in the history of Indian occultism, where the Jumna mixes its blue waters with the patriarchal Ganges, and which is chosen by the ® âktas (worshippers of the female power) for the performance of their pujas ; during which ceremonies the famous black crystals or mirrors mentioned by P. B. Randolph, are fabricated by the hands of young virgins. From there, again, to Saharanpore and Meerut, the birthplace of the mutiny of 1857. During our sojourn at the former town, it happened to be the central railway point to which, on their return from the Hardwar pilgrimmage, flocked nearly twenty-five thousand Sannyâsis and Gosains, to numbers of whom Colonel Olcott put close interrogatories, and with whom he conversed for hours. Then to Rajputana, the land inhabited by the bravest of all races in India, as well as the most mystically inclined—the Solar Race, whose Râjas trace their descent from the sun itself. We penetrated as far as Jeypore, the Paris, and at the same time the Rome of the Rajput land. We searched through plains and mountains, and all along the sacred groves covered with pagodas and devotees, among whom we found some very holy men, endowed with genuine wondrous powers, but the majority unmitigated frauds. And we got into the favour of more than one Brahman, guardian and keeper of his god’s secrets and the mysteries of his temple; but got no more evidence out of these hereditary dead beats,” as Colonel Olcott graphically dubbed them, than out of the Sannyâsis and exorcisers of evil spirits, as to the similarity of their views with those of the Spiritualists. Neither have we ever failed, whenever coming across any educated Hindu, to pump him as to the ideas and views of his countrymen about phenomena in general, and Spiritualism especially. And to all our questions, who it was in the case of holy Yogis, endowed “with miraculous powers,” that produced the manifestations, the astonished answer was invariably the 78  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" same: “He (the Yogi) himself having become one with Br ahm , produces them”; and more than once our interlocutors got thoroughly disgusted and extremely offended at Colonel Olcott’s irreverent question, whether the “bhûts” might not have been at work helping the thaumaturgist. For nearly two months uninterruptedly our premises at Bombay—garden, verandahs and halls—were crammed from early morning till late at night with native visitors of the most various sects, races and religious opinions; averaging from twenty to a hundred and more a day, coming to see us with the object of exchanging views upon metaphysical questions, and to discuss upon the relative worth of Eastern and Western philosophies—occult sciences and mysticism included. During our journey we had to receive our brothers of the Arya Samajes, which sent their deputations wherever we went to welcome us, and wherever there was a Samaj established. Thus we became intimate with the previous views of hundreds and thousands of the followers of Swami Dayanand, every one of whom had been converted by him from one idolatrous sect or another. Many of these were educated men, and as thoroughly versed in Vedic philosophy as in the tenets of the sect from which they had separated. Our chances, then, of getting acquainted with Hindu views, philosophies and traditions, were greater than those of any previous European traveller; nay, greater even than those of any officials who had resided for years in India; but who, neither belonging to the Hindu faith, nor on such friendly terms with them as ourselves, were neither trusted by the natives, nor regarded as and called by them “brothers,” as we are. It is, then, after constant researches and cross-questioning, extending over a period of several months, that we have come to the following conclusions, which are those of Mr. O’Grady: No Hindu is a Spiritualist , and, with the exception of extremely rare instances, none of them has ever heard of Spiritualism or its movements in Europe, least of all in America, with which country many of them are as little acquainted as with the North Pole. It is but now, when Swami Dayanand, in his learned researches, has found E CHOES FROM I NDIA  79 out tha t America must have been known to the early Aryans—as Arjuna, one of the five Pandavas , the friend and disciple of Krishna, is shown in Puranic history to have gone to Patal(a) in search of a wife, and married in that country Ulûpî, the widow-daughter of N ÂGA , the king of Patal(a), an antipodal country answering perfectly in its description to America, a nd unknown in those early days to any but the Aryans—that an interest for this country is being felt among the members of the Samajes. But, as we explained the origin, development and doctrines of the spiritual philosophy to our friends, and especially the modus operandi of the medium, i . e ., the communion of the Spirits of the departed with living men and women, whose organisms the former use as modes of communication, the horror of our listeners was unequalled and undisguised in each case. “ Communion with bhûts !” they exclaimed. “Communion with souls that have become wicked demons, to whom we are ready to offer sacrifices in food and drink to pacify them and make them leave us quiet, but who never come but to disturb the peace of families; whose presence is a pollution! What pleasure or comfort can the bellati (white foreigners) find in communicating"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"with them?” Thus I repeat most emphatically that not only are there, so to say, no Spiritualists in India, as we understand the term, but affirm and declare that the very suggestion of our so-called “spirit intercourse” is obnoxious to most of them—that is to say, to the oldest people in the world, people who have known all about the phenomena thousands upon thousands of years. Is this fact nothing to us, who have just begun to see the wonders of mediumship? Ought we to estimate our cleverness at so high a figure as to make us refuse to take instruction from these Orientals, who have seen their holy men—nay, even their gods and demons and the spirits of the elements — performing “miracles” since the remotest antiquity? Have we so perfected a philosophy of our own that we can compare it with that of India, which explains every mystery and triumphantly demonstrates the nature of every phenomenon? It would be worth our while—believe me—to ask Hindu help, if it 80  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS were bu t to prove, better than we can now, to the materialist and sceptical science, that, whatever may be the true theory as to the agencies, the phenomena, whether Biblical or Vedic, Christian or heathen, are in the natural order of this world, and have a first claim to scientific investigation. Let us first prove the existence of the sphinx to the profane, and afterwards we may try to unriddle its mysteries. Spiritualists will always have time enough to refute “antiquated” notions by the logic of their new theories, and spirits to measure their strength with the mystical “elementals” of old. Truth is eternal, and however long trampled down will always come out the brighter in the expiring twilight of superstition. But in one sense we are perfectly warranted to apply the name of Spiritualists to the Hindus. Opposed as they are to physical phenomena as produced by the bhûts , or unsatisfied souls of the departed, and to the possession by them of mediumistic persons, they still accept with joy those consoling evidences of the continued interest in themselves of a departed father or mother. In the subjective phenomena of dreams, in visions of clairvoyance or trance, brought on by the powers of holy men, they welcome the spirits of their beloved ones, and often receive from them important directions and advice. . . . If agreeable to your readers, I will devote a series of letters to the phenomena taking place in India, explaining them as I proceed.* I sincerely hope that the old experience of American Spiritualists, massing in threatening force against iconoclastic Theosophists and their “superannuated” ideas, will not be repeated; for my offer is perfectly impartial and friendly. It is with no desire to either teach new doctrines or carry on an unwelcome Hindu propaganda that I make it; but simply to supply material for comparison and study to the Spiritualists who think.

Well, the monsoon begins about the 15th of June, and ends about the 15th of October. In the previous long interval of eight months not a drop of rain ever falls on the blistered noses of the sweating millions of ‘mild’ Hindus, to solace their parched souls. But as, in their character of ‘benighted heathen,’ they have to prepare for Christian hell anyhow, it does not much matter. But when it does come it is a caution, I tell you!

H. S. Olcott’s Diaries , now in the Adyar Archives, the Prospectus for the first Theosophical magazine, The Theosophist , was written on July 6, 1879. On July 15, Master M. visited the Founders in his physical body, and “a most important private interview” took place, possibly on the question of the forthcoming magazine. On July 31, E. Wimbridge designed the cover for The Theosophist , and, on September 2nd began engraving it. On Sept. 11th workmen began to prepare an Editorial Office for the magazine. On Sept. 20th, the first form (eight pages) of The Theosophist was printed, and on the 27th the last form was struck off. On Sept. 28th, Col. Olcott arose and went to see the printer at 5:30 A.M., to make some changes ordered by the “revered Old Gentleman” the night before. This title was applied to Master Narayan. On Sept. 30th, the first four hundred copies of the magazine were received, and on October 1st the initial issue of The Theosophist was out, “all hands busy pasting and directing wrappers,” to quote from Col. Olcott’s Diaries . On October 3rd, a letter was received by the Colonel from Master Serapis, which apparently was the “first word from him in some time,” as Col. Olcott says. That letter instructs the Colonel on certain points in connection with The Theosophist . It says, among other things: “Assert your rights to the paper—it was established for you, none but you two have a right over it as directed by—* . . . .

[ The The o sophist , Vol. I, No. 1, October, 1879, pp. 1-2] The foundation of this journal is due to causes which, having been enumerated in the Prospec t us, need only be glanced at in this connection. They are—the rapid expansion of the Theosophical Society from America to various European and Asiatic countries; the increasing difficulty and expense in maintaining correspondence by letter with members so widely scattered; the necessity for an organ through which the native scholars of the East could communicate their learning to the Western world, and, especially, through which the sublimity of the Aryan, Buddhistic, Parsi, and other religions might be expounded by their own priest or pandits, the only competent interpreters; and finally, to the need of a repository for the facts—especially such as relate to Occultism—gathered by the Society’s Fellows among different nations. Elsewhere we have clearly explained the nature of Theosophy, and the platform of the Society; it remains for us to say a few words as to the policy of our paper. It has been shown that the individual members of our Society have their own private opinions upon all matters of a religious, as of every other, nature. They are protected in the enjoyment and expression of the same; and, as individuals, have an equal right to state them in The N A M A S T A E !   85 Theosophist , over t h eir own signatures. Some of us prefer to be known as Arya Samajists, some as Buddhists, some as idolaters, some as something else. What each is, will appear from his or her signed communications. But neither Aryan, Buddhist, nor any other representative of a particular religion, whether an editor or a contributor, can, under the Society’s rules, be allowed to use these editorial columns exclusively in the interest of the same, or unreservedly commit the paper to its propaganda. It is designed that a strict impartiality shall be observed in the editorial utterances; the paper representing the whole Theosophical Society, or Universal Brotherhood, and not any single section. The Society being neither a church nor a sect in any sense, we mean to give the same cordial welcome to communications from one class of religionists as to those from another; insisting only, that courtesy of language shall be used towards opponents. And the policy of the Society is also a full pledge and guarantee that there will be no suppression of fact nor tampering with writings , to serve the ends of any established or dissenting church of any country . Articles and correspondence upon either of the topics included in the plan of The Theosophist are invited; and while, of course, we prefer them to be in the English language, yet if sent in Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, or Gujarati, or in French, Italian, Spanish or Russian, they will be carefully translated and edited for publication. Where it is necessary to print"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"names and words in Hebrew, Greek, and other characters (except Sanskrit and the Indian vernaculars) unlike the Roman, authors will kindly write also their phonetic equivalents in English, as the resources of our printer’s office do not appear great in this direction.

Statements of fact will not be accepted from unknown parties without due authentication. It is designed that our journal shall be read with as much interest by those who are not deep philosophers as by 86  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS those who are. Some will delight to follow the pandits through the mazes of metaphysical subtlet i es and the translations of ancient manuscripts, others to be instructed through the medium of legends and tales of mystical import. Our pages will be like the many viands at a feast, where each appetite may be satisfied and none are sent away hungry. The practical wants of life are to many readers more urgent than the spiritual, and that it is not our purpose to neglect them our pages will amply show. One more word at the threshold before we bid our guests to enter. The first number of The Theosophist has been brought out under mechanical difficulties which would not have been encountered either at New York or London, and which we hope to escape in future issues. For instance: We first tried to have Mr. Edward Wimbridge’s excellent design for the cover engraved on wood, but there was no wood to be had of the right sizes to compose the block, nor any clamps to fasten them together; nor was there an engraver competent to do justice to the subject. In lithography we fared no better; there was not a pressman who could be trusted to print artistic work in colours, and the proprietor of one of the best job offices in India advised us to send the order to London. As a last resort we determined to print the design in relief, and then scoured the metal markets of Bombay and Calcutta for rolled metal plate. Having finally secured an old piece, the artist was forced to invent an entirely novel process to etch on it, and to execute the work himself. We mention these facts in the hope that our unemployed young Indian brothers may recall the old adage, “where there is a will, there is a way” and apply the lesson to their own case. And now, friends and enemies, all— Namastae ! "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME II 1879 W HAT IS T HEOSOPHY?   87 WHAT I S THEOSOPHY? [ The Theosophist , Vol. I, No. 1, October, 1879, pp. 2-5] This question has been so often asked, and misconception so widely prevails, that the editors o f a journal devoted to an exposition of the world’s Theosophy would be remiss were its first number issued without coming to a full understanding with their readers. But our heading involves two further queries: What is the Theosophical Society; and what are the Theosophists? To each an answer will be given. According to lexicographers, the term theosophia is composed of two Greek words— theos , “god,” and sophos , “wise.” So far, correct. But the explanations that follow are far from giving a clear idea of Theosophy. Webster defines it most originally as “a supposed intercourse with God and superior spirits, and consequent attainment of superhuman knowledge, by physical processes , as by the theurgic operations of some ancient Platonists, or by the chemical processes of the German fire-philosophers.” This, to say the least, is a poor and flippant explanation. To attribute such ideas to men like Ammonius Saccas, Plotinus, Iamblichus, Porphyry, Proclus—shows either intentional misrepresentation, or Mr. Webster’s ignorance of the philosophy and motives of the greatest geniuses of the later Alexandrian School. To impute to those whom their contemporaries as well as posterity styled “theodidaktoi,” god-taught—a purpose to develop their psychological, spiritual perceptions by “physical processes,” is to describe them 8 8  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS as mater ialists. As to the concluding fling at the fire-philosophers, it rebounds from them to fall hom e among our most eminent modern men of science; those, in whose mouths the Rev. James Martineau places the following boast: “matter is all we want; give us atoms alone, and we will explain the universe.” Vaughan offers a far better, more philosophical definition. “A Theosophist,” he says—“is one who gives you a theory of God or the works of God, which has not revelation, but an inspiration of his own for its basis.” In this view every great thinker and philosopher, especially every founder of a new religion, school of philosophy, or sect, is necessarily a Theosophist. Hence, Theosophy and Theosophists have existed ever since the first glimmering of nascent thought made man seek instinctively for the means of expressing his own independent opinions. There were Theosophists before the Christian era, notwithstanding that the Christian"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"writers ascribe the development of the Eclectic theosophical system, to the early part of the third century of their Era. Diogenes Laërtius traces Theosophy to an epoch antedating the dynasty of the Ptolemies; and names as its founder an Egyptian Hierophant called Pot-Amun, the name being Coptic and signifying a priest consecrated to Amun, the god of Wisdom. But history shows it revived by Ammonius Saccas, the founder of the Neo-Platonic School. He and his disciples called themselves “Philaletheians”—lovers of the truth; while others termed them the “Analogists,” on account of their method of interpreting all sacred legends, symbolical myths and mysteries, by a rule of analogy or correspondence, so that events which had occurred in the external world were regarded as expressing operations and experiences of the human soul. It was the aim and purpose of Ammonius to reconcile all sects, peoples and nations under one common faith—a belief in one Supreme, Eternal, Unknown, and Unnamed Power, governing the Universe by immutable and eternal laws. His object was to prove a primitive system of Theosophy, which at the beginning was essentially alike in all countries; to induce all WHAT IS THEOSOPHY?   89 men to lay aside their strives and quarrels, and unite in purpose and thought as the children of one co m mon mother; to purify the ancient religions, by degrees corrupted and obscured, from all dross of human element, by uniting and expounding them upon pure philosophical principles. Hence, the Buddhistic, Vedantic and Magian, or Zoroastrian, systems were taught in the Eclectic Theosophical School along with all the philosophies of Greece. Hence also, that pre-eminently Buddhistic and Indian feature among the ancient Theosophists of Alexandria, of due reverence for parents and aged persons; a fraternal affection for the whole human race; and a compassionate feeling for even the dumb animals. While seeking to establish a system of moral discipline which enforced upon people the duty to live according to the laws of their respective countries; to exalt their minds by the research and contemplation of the one Absolute Truth; his chief object in order, as he believed, to achieve all others, was to extract from the various religious teachings, as from a many-chorded instrument, one full and harmonius melody, which would find response in every truth-loving heart. Theosophy is, then, the archaic Wisdom-Religion , the esoteric doctrine once known in every ancient country having claims to civilization. This “Wisdom” all the old writings show us as an emanation of the divine Principle; and the clear comprehension of it is typified in such names as the Indian Budha, the Babylonian Nebo, the Thoth of Memphis, the Hermes of Greece; in the appelations, also, of some goddesses—Metis, Neitha, Athena, the Gnostic Sophia , and finally—the Vedas , from the word “to know.” Under this designation, all the ancient philosophers of the East and West, the Hierophants of old Egypt, the Rishis of Aryavarta, the Theodidaktoi of Greece, included all knowledge of things occult and essentially divine. The Mercavah of the Hebrew Rabbis, the secular and popular series, were thus designated as only the vehicle, the outward shell which contained the higher esoteric knowledge. The Magi of Zoroaster received instruction and were initiated in the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"caves and secret lodges of Bactria; the Egyptian and Grecian 90  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS hieroph ants had their aporrhêta , or sec r et discourses, during which the Mystês became an Epoptês— a Seer. The central idea of the Eclectic Theosophy was that of a single Supreme Essence, Unknown and Unknowable— for—“How could one know the knower?” as enquires Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . Their system was characterized by three distinct features: the theory of the above-named Essence; the doctrine of the human soul—an emanation from the latter, hence of the same nature; and its theurgy. It is this last science which has led the Neo-Platonists to be so misrepresented in our era of materialistic science. Theurgy being essentially the art of applying the divine powers of man to the subordination of the blind forces of nature, its votaries were first termed magicians—a corruption of the word “Magh,” signifying a wise, or learned man, and—derided. Skeptics of a century ago would have been as wide of the mark if they had laughed at the idea of a phonograph or a telegraph. The ridiculed and the “infidels” of one generation generally become the wise men and saints of the next. As regards the Divine Essence and the nature of the soul and spirit, modern Theosophy believes now as ancient Theosophy did. The popular Diu of the Aryan nations was identical with the Iao of the Chaldeans, and even with the Jupiter of the less learned and philosophical among the Romans; and it was just as identical with the Jahve of the Samaritans, the Tiu or “Tuisto” of the Northmen, the Duw of the Britons, and the Zeus of the Thracians. As to the Absolute Essence, the One and All—whether we accept the Greek Pythagorean, the Chaldean Kabalistic, or the Aryan philosophy in regard to it, it will all lead to one and the same result. The Primeval Monad of the Pythagorean system, which retires into darkness and is itself Darkness (for human intellect) was made the basis of all things; and we can find the idea in all its integrity in the philosophical systems of Leibnitz and Spinoza. Therefore, whether a Theosophist agrees with the Kabala which, speaking of En-Soph, propounds the query: “Who, then, can comprehend It, since It is formless, and Non-Existent?”—or, W HAT IS T HEOSOPHY?   91 rememb e ring that magnificent hymn from the Rig-Veda (Hymn 129th, Book 10th)— enquire s : “Who knows from whence this great creation sprang? Whether his will created or was mute. He knows it—or perchance even He knows not .”"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Or, again, accepts the Vedantic conception of Brahma, who in the Upanishads is represented as “without life, without mind, pure,” unconscious , for—Brahma is “Absolute Consciousness.” Or, even finally, siding with the Svâbhâvikas of Nepal, maintains that nothing exists but “Svabhavat” (substance or nature) which exists by itself without any creator—any one of the above conceptions can lead but to pure and absolute Theosophy. That Theosophy which prompted such men as Hegel, Fichte and Spinoza to take up the labours of the old Grecian philosophers and speculate upon the One Substance—the Deity, the Divine All proceeding from the Divine Wisdom—incomprehensible, unknown, and unnamed— by any ancient or modern religious philosophy, with the exception of Christianity and Mohammedanism. Every Theosophist, then, holding to a theory of the Deity “which has not revelation, but an inspiration of his own for its basis,” may accept any of the above definitions or belong to any of these religions, and yet remain strictly within the boundaries of Theosophy. For the latter is belief in the Deity as the ALL, the source of all existence, the infinite that cannot be either comprehended or known, the universe alone revealing It , or, as some prefer it, Him, thus giving a sex to that, to anthropomorphize which is blasphemy . True, Theosophy shrinks from brutal materialization; it prefers believing that, from eternity retired within itself, the Spirit of the Deity neither wills nor creates; but that, from the infinite effulgency everywhere going forth from the Great Centre, that which produces all visible and invisible things is but a Ray containing in itself the generative and conceptive power, which, in its turn produces that which the Greeks called Macrocosm , the Kabalists Tikkun or Adam Kadmon—the archetypal man, and the Aryans Purusha , the manifested Brahm, or the Divine Male. Theosophy believes also in the Anastasis 92  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS or continued existence, and in transmigration (evolution) or a series of changes in the soul* which ca n be defended and explained on strict philosophical principles; and only by making a distinction between Paramâtma (transcendental, supreme soul) and Jivâtma (animal, or conscious soul) of the Vedantins. To fully define Theosophy, we must consider it under all its aspects. The interior world has not been hidden from all by impenetrable darkness. By that higher intuition acquired by Theosophia— or God-knowledge, which carries the mind from the world of form into that of formless spirit, man has been sometimes enabled in every age and every country to perceive things in the interior or invisible world. Hence, the “Samadhi,” or Dyan Yog Samadhi , of the Hindu ascetics; the “Daïmonion-photi,” or spiritual illumination, of the Neo-Platonists; the “Sidereal confabulation of souls,” of the Rosicrucians or Fire-philosophers; and, even the ecstatic trance of mystics and of the modern mesmerists and spiritualists, are identical in nature, though various as to manifestation. The search after man’s diviner “self,” so often and so erroneously interpreted as individual communion with a personal God, was the object of every mystic, and belief in its possibility seems to have been coëval with the genesis of humanity—each people giving it another name. Thus Plato and Plotinus call “Noëtic work” that which the Yogis and the Srotriya term Vidya . “ By reflection, self-knowledge and intellectual discipline, the soul can be raised to the vision of eternal truth, goodness, and"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"beauty —that is, to the Vision of God— this is the epopteia ,” said –––––––––– *In a series of articles entitled “The World’s Great Theosophists,” we intend showing that from Pythagora s, who got his wisdom in India, down to our best known modern philosophers, and theosophists—David Hume, and Shelley, the English poet the Spiritists of France included—many believed and yet believe in metempsychosis or reincarnation of the soul; however unelaborated the system of the Spiritists may fairly be regarded.

Through self-contemplation, perfect chastity, and purity of body, we may approach nearer to It, and receive, in that state, true knowledge and wonderful insight.” And Swami Dayânund Saraswati, who has read neither Porphyry nor other Greek authors, but who is a thorough Vedic scholar, says in his Veda-Bhâshya (upâsanâ prakara ank. 9)—“To obtain Diksha (highest initiations) and Yog , one has to practice according to the rules . . . The soul in human body can perform the greatest wonders by knowing the Universal Spirit (or God) and acquainting itself with the properties and qualities (occult) of all the things in the universe. A human being (a Dikshita or initiate) can thus acquire a power of seeing and hearing at great distances.” Finally, Alfred R. Wallace, F.R.S., a spiritualist and yet a confessedly great naturalist, says, with brave candour: “It is ‘spirit’ that alone feels, and perceives, and thinks—that acquires knowledge, and reasons and aspires . . . there not unfrequently occur individuals so constituted that the spirit can perceive independently of the corporeal organs of sense, or can, perhaps, wholly or partially, quit the body for a time and return to it again . . . the spirit . . . communicates with spirit easier than with matter.” We can now see how, after thousands of years have intervened between the age of the Gymnosophists* and our own highly civilized era, notwithstanding, or, perhaps, just because of, such an enlightenment which pours its radiant light upon the psychological as well as upon the physical realms of nature, over twenty millions of people today believe, under a different form, in those same spiritual powers that were believed in by the Yogins and the Pythagoreans, nearly 3,000 years ago.

And all these, Aryan Yogis, Greek philosophers, and modern spiritualists, affirm that possibility on the ground that the embodied soul and its never embodied spirit—the real self— are not separated from either the Universal Soul or other spirits by space, but merely by the differentiation of their qualities; as in the boundless expanse of the universe there can be no limitation. And that when this difference is once removed—according to the Greeks and Aryans by abstract contemplation, producing the temporary liberation of the imprisoned Soul; and according to Spiritualists, through mediumship— such an union between embodied and disembodied spirits becomes possible. Thus was it that Patañjali’s Yogis and, following in their steps, Plotinus, Porphyry, and other Neo-Platonists, maintained that in their hours of ecstasy, they had been united to, or rather become as one with, God, several times during the course of their lives. This idea, erroneous as it may seem in its application to the Universal Spirit, was, and is, claimed by too many great philosophers to be put aside as entirely chimerical. In the case of the Theodidaktoi, the only controvertible point, the dark spot on this philosophy of extreme mysticism, was its claim to include that which is simply ecstatic illumination, under the head of sensuous perception. In the case of the Yogins, who maintained their ability to see I \u0001 wara “face to face,” this claim was successfully o v e r t h r o wn by the stern logic of Kapila. As to the similar assumption made for their Greek followers, for a long array of Christian ecstatics, and, finally, for the last two claimants to “God-seeing” within these last hundred years—Jacob Böhme and Swedenborg—this pretension would and should have been philosophically and logically questioned, if a few of our great men of science WHAT IS THEOSOPHY?  95 who are Spiritualists had had more interest in the philosophy than in the mere phenome n alism of Spiritualism. The Alexandrian Theosophists were divided into neophytes, initiates, and masters, or hierophants; and their rules were copied from the ancient Mysteries of Orpheus, who, according to Herodotus, brought them from India. Ammonius obligated his disciples by oath not to divulge his higher doctrines, except to those who were proved thoroughly worthy and initiated, and who had learned to regard the gods, the angels, and the demons of other peoples, according to the esoteric hyponoia , or under-meaning. “The gods exist, but they are not what the hoi polloi , the uneducated multitude, suppose them to be,” says Epicurus. “He is not an atheist who denies the existence of the gods whom the multitude worship, but he is such who fastens on these gods the opinions of the multitude.” In his turn, Aristotle declares that of the “Divine Essence pervading the whole world of nature, what are styled the gods are simply the first principles.”* Plotinus, the pupil of the “God-taught” Ammonius, tells us, that the secret gnosis or the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"knowledge of Theosophy, has three degrees—opinion, science, and illumination . “The means or instrument of the first is sense, or perception; of the second, dialectics; of the third, intuition. To the last, reason is subordinate; it is absolute knowledge , founded on the identification of the mind with the object known.” Theosophy is the exact science of psychology, so to say; it stands in relation to natural, uncultivated mediumship, as the knowledge of a Tyndall stands to that of a school-boy in physics. It develops in man a direct beholding; that which Schelling denominates “a realization of the identity of subject and object in the individual”; so that under the influence and knowledge of hyponoia man thinks divine thoughts, views all things as they really are, and, finally, “becomes recipient of the Soul of the World,” to use one of the finest expressions of Emerson. “I, the imperfect, –––––––––– * [ Vide Diog e nes Laertius, Lives , X, 123, where the Greek word acebês means impious, irreverent, ungodly, rather than “atheist”; and Aristotle, Metaphysics , Bk.

Besid e s this psychological, or soul-state, Theosophy cultivated every branch of sciences and arts. It was thoroughly familiar with what is now commonly known as mesmerism. Practical theurgy or “ceremonial magic,” so often resorted to in their exorcisms by the Roman Catholic clergy—was discarded by the Theosophists. It is but Iamblichus alone who, transcending the other Eclectics, added to Theosophy the doctrine of Theurgy. When ignorant of the true meaning of the esoteric divine symbols of nature, man is apt to miscalculate the powers of his soul, and, instead of communing spiritually and mentally with the higher, celestial beings, the good spirits (the gods of the theurgists of the Platonic school), he will unconsciously call forth the evil, dark powers which lurk around humanity—the undying, grim creations of human crimes and vices—and thus fall from theurgia (white magic) into goëtia (or black magic, sorcery). Yet, neither white, nor black magic are what popular superstition understands by the terms. The possibility of “raising spirits” according to the key of Solomon, is the height of superstition and ignorance. Purity of deed and thought can alone raise us to an intercourse “with the gods” and attain for us the goal we desire. Alchemy, believed by so many to have been a spiritual philosophy as well as a physical science, belonged to the teachings of the theosophical school. It is a noticeable fact that neither Zoroaster, Buddha, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Confucius, S o c r a t e s , nor Ammonius Saccas, committed anything to writing. The reason for it is obvious. Theosophy is a double-edged weapon and unfit for the ignorant or the selfish. Like every ancient philosophy it has its votaries among the moderns; but, until late in our own days, its disciples were few in numbers, and of the most various sects and opinions. “Entirely speculative, and founding no schools, they have still exercised a silent influence upon philosophy; and, no doubt, when the time arrives, many ideas thus silently propounded may yet give new directions to human thought”—remarks Mr. Kenneth R.

Are they entitled to any consideration, as capable of discussing philosophy and promoting real science; or should they be treated with the compassionate toleration which one gives to “harmless enthusiasts”? The Theosophical Society has been variously charged with a belief in “miracles,” and “miracle-working”; with a secret political object—like the Carbonari; with being spies of an autocratic Czar; with preaching socialistic and nihilistic doctrines; and, mirabile dictu , with having a covert understanding with the French Jesuits, to disrupt modern Spiritualism for a pecuniary consideration! With equal violence they have been denounced as dreamers, by the American Positivists; as fetish-worshippers, by some of the New York press; as revivalists of “mouldy superstitions,” by the Spiritualists; as infidel emissaries of Satan, by the Christian Church; as the very types of “ gobe-mouche ,” by Professor W.

Still later, it found itself in alliance with the Indian Arya Samaj, headed by the learned Pandit Dayânund Saraswati Swâmi, and the Ceylonese Buddhists, under the erudite H. Sumangala, High Priest of Adam’s Peak and President of the Widyodaya College, Colombo. He who would seriously attempt to fathom the psychological sciences, must come"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"to the sacred land of ancient Âryâvarta. None is older than she in esoteric wisdom and civilization, however fallen may be her poor shadow—modern India. Holding this country, as we do, for the fruitful hot-bed whence proceeded all subsequent philosophical systems, to this source of all psychology and philosophy a portion of our Society has come to learn its ancient wisdom and ask for the impartation of its weird secrets. Philology has made too much progress to require at this late day a demonstration of this fact of the primogenitive nationality of Âryâvarta. The unproved and prejudiced hypothesis of modern Chronology is not worthy of a moment’s thought, and it will vanish in time like so many other unproved hypotheses. The line of philosophical heredity, from Kapila through Epicurus to James Mill; from Patañjali through Plotinus to Jacob Böhme, can be traced like the course of a river through a landscape. One of the objects of the Society’s organization was to examine the too transcendent views of the Spiritualists in regard to the powers of disembodied spirits; and, having told them what, in our opinion at least, a portion of their phenomena are not , it will become incumbent upon us now to show what they are. So apparent is it that it is in the East, and especially in India, that the key to the alleged “supernatural” phenomena of the Spiritualists must be sought, that it has recently been conceded in the Allahabad Pioneer (August 1 0 0  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS 11th, 18 7 9), an Anglo-Indian daily journal which has not the reputation of saying what it does no t mean. Blaming the men of science who “intent upon physical discovery, for some generations have been too prone to neglect super-physical investigation,” it mentions “the new wave of doubt” (Spiritualism) which has “latterly disturbed this conviction.” To a large number of persons, including many of high culture and intelligence, it adds, “the supernatural has again asserted itself as a fit subject of inquiry and research. And there are plausible hypotheses in favour of the idea that among the ‘sages’ of the East . . . there may be found in a higher degree than among the more modernized inhabitants of the West traces of those personal peculiarities, whatever they may be, which are required as a condition precedent to the occurrence of supernatural phenomena.” And then, unaware that the cause he pleads is one of the chief aims and objects of our Society, the editorial writer remarks that it is “the only direction in which, it seems to us, the efforts of the Theosophists in India might possibly be useful. The leading members of the Theosophical Society in India are known to be very advanced students of occult phenomena, already, and we cannot but hope that their professions of interest in Oriental philosophy . . . may cover a reserved intention of carrying out explorations of the kind we indicate.” While, as observed, one of our objects, it yet is but one of many; the most important of which is to revive the work of Ammonius Saccas, and make various nations remember that they are the children “of one mother.” As to the transcendental side of the ancient Theosophy, it is also high time that the Theosophical Society should"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"explain. With how much, then, of this nature-searching, God-seeking science of the ancient Aryan and Greek mystics, and of the powers of modern spiritual mediumship, does the Society agree? Our answer is:—with it all. But if asked what it believes in, the reply will be:—“ as a body— Nothing.” The Society, as a body, has no creed, as creeds are but the shells around spiritual knowledge; and Theosophy in its fruition is spiritual knowledge itself—the very essence of W HAT ARE THE T HEOSOPHISTS?  101 philos o phical and theistic enquiry. Visible representative of Universal Theosophy, it can be no m ore sectarian than a Geographical Society, which represents universal geographical exploration without caring whether the explorers be of one creed or another. The religion of the Society is an algebraical equation, in which so long as the sign = of equality is not omitted, each member is allowed to substitute quantities of his own, which better accord with climatic and other exigencies of his native land, with the idiosyncrasies of his people, or even with his own. Having no accepted creed, our Society is very ready to give and take, to learn and teach, by practical experimentation, as opposed to mere passive and credulous acceptance of enforced dogma. It is willing to accept every result claimed by any of the foregoing schools or systems, that can be logically and experimentally demonstrated. Conversely, it can take nothing on mere faith, no matter by whom the demand may be made. But, when we come to consider ourselves individually, it is quite another thing. The Society’s members represent the most varied nationalities and races, and were born and educated in the most dissimilar creeds and social conditions. Some of them believe in one thing, others in another. Some incline toward the ancient magic , or secret wisdom that was taught in the sanctuaries, which was the very opposite of supernaturalism or diabolism; others in modern spiritualism, or intercourse with the spirits of the dead; still others in mesmerism or animal magnetism, or only an occult dynamic force in nature. A certain number have scarcely yet acquired any definite belief, but are in a state of attentive expectancy; and there are even those who call themselves materialists, in a certain sense. Of atheists and bigoted sectarians of any religion, there are none in the Society; for the very fact of a man’s joining it proves that he is in search of the final truth as to the ultimate essence of things. If there be such a thing as a speculative atheist, which philosophers may deny, he would have to reject both cause and effect, whether in this world of matter, or in that of spirit. There may be members who, like the poet Shelley, have let their imagination soar from cause to prior cause ad 102  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"infinitum , as each in its turn became logically transformed into a result necessitating a prior cause, until they have thinned the Eternal into a mere mist. But even they are not atheists in the speculative sense, whether they identify the material forces of the universe with the functions with which the theists endow their God, or otherwise; for once that they cannot free themselves from the conception of the abstract ideal of power, cause, necessity, and effect, they can be considered as atheists only in respect to a personal God, and not to the Universal Soul of the Pantheist. On the other hand, the bigoted sectarian, fenced in, as he is, with a creed upon every paling of which is written the warning “No Thoroughfare,” can neither come out of his enclosure to join the Theosophical Society, nor, if he could, has it room for one whose very religion forbids examination. The very root idea of the Society is free and fearless investigation. As a body, the Theosophical Society holds that all original thinkers and investigators of the hidden side of nature whether materialists those who find matter “the promise and potency of all terrestrial life,” or spiritualists—that is, those who discover in spirit the source of all energy and of matter as well, were and are, properly, Theosophists. For to be one, one need not necessarily recognize the existence of any special God or a deity. One need but worship the spirit of living nature, and try to identify oneself with it. To revere that Presence , the invisible Cause, which is yet ever manifesting itself in its incessant results; the intangible, omnipotent, and omnipresent Proteus: indivisible in its Essence, and eluding form, yet appearing under all and every form; who is here and there, and everywhere and nowhere; is A LL , and N OTHING ; ubiquit o us yet one; the Essence filling, binding, bounding, containing everything; contained in all. It will, we think, be seen now, that whether classed as Theists, Pantheists or Atheists, such men are near kinsmen to the rest. Be what he may, once that a student abandons the old and trodden highway of routine, and enters upon the solitary path of independent thought—Godward—he is a Theosophist; an original thinker, a seeker after W HAT ARE THE T HEOSOPHISTS?  103 the ete r nal truth with “an inspiration of his own” to solve the universal problems. With ever y man that is earnestly searching in his own way after a knowledge of the Divine Principle, of man’s relations to it, and nature’s manifestations of it, Theosophy is allied. It is likewise the ally of honest science, as distinguished from much that passes for exact , physical science, so long as the latter does not poach on the domains of psychology and metaphysics. And it is also the ally of every honest religion—to wit: a religion willing to be judged by the same tests as it applies to the others. Those books, which contain the most self-evident truth, are to it inspired (not revealed). But all books it regards, on account of the human element contained in them, as inferior to the Book of Nature; to read which and comprehend it correctly, the innate powers of the soul must be highly"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"developed. Ideal laws can be perceived by the intuitive faculty alone; they are beyond the domain of argument and dialectics, and no one can understand or rightly appreciate them through the explanations of another mind, though even this mind be claiming a direct revelation. And, as this Society which allows the widest sweep in the realms of the pure ideal, is no less firm in the sphere of facts, its deference to modern science and its just representatives is sincere. Despite all their lack of a higher spiritual intuition, the world’s debt to the representatives of modern physical science is immense; hence, the Society endorses heartily the noble and indignant protest of that gifted and eloquent preacher, the Rev. O. B. Frothingham, against those who try to undervalue the services of our great naturalists. “Talk of Science as being irreligious, atheistic,” he exclaimed in a recent lecture, delivered at New York, “Science is creating a new idea of God. It is due to Science that we have any conception at all of a living God. If we do not become atheists one of these days under the maddening effect of Protestantism, it will be due to Science, because it is disabusing us of hideous illusions that tease and embarrass us, and putting us in the way of knowing how to reason about the things we see . . .” 1 0 4  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS And it is also due to the unremitting labours of such Orientalists as Sir W. Jones, Max Müll e r, Burnouf, Colebrooke, Haug, de Saint-Hilaire, and so many others, that the Society, as a body, feels equal respect and veneration for Vedic, Buddhist, Zoroastrian, and other old religions of the world; and, a like brotherly feeling towards its Hindu, Sinhalese, Parsi, Jain, Hebrew, and Christian members as individual students of “self,” of nature, and of the divine in nature. Born in the United States of America, the Society was constituted on the model of its Motherland. The latter omitting the name of God from its Constitution lest it should afford a pretext one day to make a state religion, gives absolute equality to all religions in its laws. All support and each is in turn protected by the State. The Society, modelled upon this Constitution, may fairly be termed a “Republic of Conscience. We have now, we think, made clear why our members, as individuals, are free to stay outside or inside any creed they please, provided they do not pretend that none but themselves shall enjoy the privilege of conscience, and try to force their opinions upon the others. In this respect the Rules of the Society are very strict. It tries to act upon the wisdom of the old Buddhistic axiom, “Honour thine own faith, and do not slander that of others”; echoed back in our present century, in the “Declaration of Principles” of the Brahmo Samaj, which so nobly states that: “no sect shall be vilified, ridiculed, or hated.” In Section VI of the Revised Rules of the Theosophical Society, recently adopted in General Council, at Bombay, is this mandate: “It is not lawful for any officer of the Parent Society to express, by word or act, any hostility to, or preference for, any one section (sectarian division, or group within the Society) more than"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"another. All must be regarded and treated as equally the objects of the Society’s solicitude and exertions. All have an equal right to have the essential features of their religious belief laid before the tribunal of an impartial world.” In their individual capacity, members may, when attacked, occasionally break this Rule, but, nevertheless, as W HAT ARE THE T HEOSOPHISTS?  105 office r s they are restrained, and the Rule is strictly enforced during the meetings. For, above al l human sects stands Theosophy in its abstract sense; Theosophy which is too wide for any of them to contain but which easily contains them. In conclusion, we may state that, broader and far more universal in its views than any existing mere scientific Society, it has plus science its belief in every possibility, and determined will to penetrate into those unknown spiritual regions which exact science pretends that its votaries have no business to explore. And, it has one quality more than any religion in that it makes no difference between Gentile, Jew, or Christian. It is in this spirit that the Society has been established upon the footing of a Universal Brotherhood. Unconcerned about politics; hostile to the insane dreams of Socialism and of Communism, which it abhors—as both are but disguised conspiracies of brutal force and sluggishness against honest labour; the Society cares but little about the outward human management of the material world. The whole of its aspirations are directed toward the occult truths of the visible and invisible worlds. Whether the physical man be under the rule of an empire or a republic, concerns only the man of matter. His body may be enslaved; as to his Soul, he has the right to give to his rulers the proud answer of Socrates to his Judges. They have no sway over the inner man. Such is, then, the Theosophical Society, and such its principles, its multifarious aims, and its objects. Need we wonder at the past misconceptions of the general public, and the easy hold the enemy has been able to find to lower it in the public estimation? The true student has ever been a recluse, a man of silence and meditation. With the busy world his habits and tastes are so little in common that, while he is studying, his enemies and slanderers have undisturbed opportunities. But time cures all and lies are but ephemera. Truth alone is eternal. About a few of the Fellows of the Society who have made great scientific discoveries, and some others to whom the psychologist and the biologist are indebted for the new light 106  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS thrown upon the darker problems of the inner man, we will speak later on. Our object now was b u t to prove to the reader that Theosophy is neither “a newfangled doctrine,”"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"a political cabal, nor one of those societies of enthusiasts which are born today but to die tomorrow. That not all of its members can think alike, is proved by the Society having organized into two great Divisions—the Eastern and the Western—and the latter being divided into numerous sections, according to races and religious views. One man’s thought, infinitely various as are its manifestations, is not all-embracing. Denied ubiquity, it must necessarily speculate but in one direction; and once transcending the boundaries of exact human knowledge, it has to err and wander, for the ramifications of the one Central and Absolute Truth are infinite. Hence, we occasionally find even the greater philosophers losing themselves in the labyrinths of speculations, thereby provoking the criticism of posterity. But as all work for one and the same object, namely, the disenthrallment of human thought, the elimination of superstitions, and the discovery of truth, all are equally welcome. The attainment of these objects, all agree, can best be secured by convincing the reason and warming the enthusiasm of the generation of fresh young minds, that are just ripening into maturity, and making ready to take the place of their prejudiced and conservative fathers. And, as each—the great ones as well as small—have trodden the royal road to knowledge, we listen to all, and take both small and great into our fellowship. For no honest searcher comes back empty-handed, and even he who has enjoyed the least share of popular favour can lay at least his mite upon the one altar of Truth.

The first impulse of hostility has nearly spent itself, and the moment approaches when a patient hearing will be given to our arguments. This was foreseen by us from the beginning. The founders of our Society were mainly veteran Spiritualists, who had outgrown their first amazement at the strange phenomena, and felt the necessity to investigate the laws of mediumship to the very bottom. Their reading of mediaeval and ancient works upon the occult sciences had shown them that our modern phenomena were but repetitions of what had been seen, studied, and comprehended in former epochs. In the biographies of ascetics, mystics, theurgists, prophets, ecstatics; of astrologers, “diviners,” “magicians,” “sorcerers,” and other students, subjects, or practitioners of the Occult Power in its many branches, they found ample evidence that Western Spiritualism could only be comprehended by the creation of a science of Comparative Psychology. By a like synthetic method the philologists, under the lead of Eugène Burnouf, had unlocked the secrets of religious and philological heredity, and exploded Western theological theories and dogmas until then deemed impregnable. Proceeding in this spirit, the Theosophists thought they discovered some reasons to doubt the correctness of the spiritualistic theory that all the phenomena of the circles must 108  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS of necessity be attributed solely to the action of spirits of our deceased friends. The ancient s knew and classified other supercorporeal entities that are capable of moving objects, floating the bodies of mediums through the air, giving apparent tests of the identity of dead persons, and controlling sensitives to write and speak strange languages, paint pictures, and play upon unfamiliar musical instruments. And not only knew them, but showed how these invisible powers might be controlled by man, and made to work these wonders at his bidding. They found, moreover, that there were two sides of Occultism—a good and an evil side; and that it was a dangerous and fearful thing for the inexperienced to meddle with the latter—dangerous to our moral as to our physical nature. The conviction forced itself upon their minds, then, that while the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"weird wonders of Spiritualism were among the most important of all that could be studied, mediumship, without the most careful attention to every condition, was fraught with peril. Thus thinking, and impressed with the great importance of a thorough knowledge of mesmerism and all other branches of Occultism, these founders established the Theosophical Society, to read, enquire, compare, study, experiment and expound, the mysteries of Psychology. This range of enquiry, of course, included an investigation of Vedic, Brahmanical and other ancient Oriental literature; for in that—especially the former, the grandest repository of wisdom ever accessible to humanity—lay the entire mystery of nature and of man. To comprehend modern mediumship it is, in short, indispensable to familiarize oneself with the Yoga Philosophy; and the aphorisms of Patañjali are even more essential than the “Divine Revelations” of Andrew Jackson Davis. We can never know how much of the mediumistic phenomena we must attribute to the disembodied until it is settled how much can be done by the embodied, human soul, and the blind but active powers at work within those regions which are yet unexplored by science. Not even proof of an existence beyond the grave, if it must come to us in a phenomenal shape. This will be conceded without qualification, we think, provided that the records T HE D RIFT OF W ESTERN S PIRITUALISM  109 of hist o ry be admitted as corroborating the statements we have made. The reade r will observe that the primary issue between the theosophical and spiritualistic theories of mediumistic phenomena is that the Theosophists say the phenomena may be produced by more agencies than one, and the latter that but one agency can be conceded, namely—the disembodied souls. There are other differences—as, for instance, that there can be such a thing as the obliteration of the human individuality as the result of very evil environment; that good spirits seldom, if ever, cause physical “manifestations,” etc. But the first point to settle is the one here first stated; and we have shown how and in what directions the Theosophists maintain that the investigations should be pushed. Our East Indian readers, unlike those of Western countries who may see these lines, do not know how warmly and stoutly these issues have been debated, these past three or four years. Suffice it to say that, a point having been reached where argument seemed no longer profitable, the controversy ceased; and that the present visit of the New York Theosophists, and their establishment of the Bombay Headquarters, with the library, lectures, and this journal, are its tangible results. That this step must have a very great influence upon Western psychological science is apparent. Whether our Committee are themselves fully competent to observe and properly expound Eastern Psychology or not, no one will deny that Western Science must inevitably be enriched by the contributions of the Indian, Sinhalese, and other mystics who will now find in The Theosophist a channel by which to reach European and American students of"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Occultism, such as was never imagined, not to say seen, before. It is our earnest hope and belief that after the broad principles of our Society, its earnestness, and exceptional facilities for gathering Oriental wisdom, are well understood, it will be better thought of than now by Spiritualists, and attract into its fellowship many more of their brightest and best intellects. Theosophy can be styled the enemy of Spiritualism with 110  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS no more p ropriety than of Mesmerism, or any other branch of Psychology. In this wondrou s outburst of phenomena that the Western world has been seeing since 1848, is presented such an opportunity to investigate the hidden mysteries of being as the world has scarcely known before. Theosophists only urge that these phenomena shall be studied so thoroughly that our epoch shall not pass away with the mighty problem unsolved. Whatever obstructs this—whether the narrowness of sciolism, the dogmatism of theology, or the prejudice of any other class, should be swept aside as something hostile to the public interest. Theosophy, with its design to search back into historic records for proof, may be regarded as the natural outcome of phenomenalistic Spiritualism, or as a touchstone to show the value of its pure gold.

To bring the two conflicting elements—exact science and metaphysics—into direct contact, might create as great a disturbance as to throw a piece of potassium into a basin of water. The very fact that we are predestined and pledged to prove that some of the wisest of Western scholars have been misled by the dead letter of appearances and that they are unable to discover the hidden spirit in the relics of old, places us under the ban from the start. With those sciolists who are neither broad enough, nor sufficiently modest to allow their decisions to be reviewed, we are necessarily in antagonism. Therefore, it is essential that our position in relation to certain scientific hypotheses, A NTIQUITY OF THE V EDAS  111 perhap s tentative and only sanctioned for want of better ones—should be clearly defined a t the outset. An infinitude of study has been bestowed by the archaeologists and the Orientalists upon the question of chronology—especially in regard to Comparative Theology. So far, their affirmations as to the relative antiquity of the great religions of the pre-Christian era are little more than plausible hypotheses. How far back the national and religious Vedic period, so-called, extends— “it is impossible to tell,” confesses Professor Max Müller; nevertheless, he traces it “to a period anterior to 1000 B.C .,” and brin g s us “to 1100 or 1200 B.C ., as the earliest time when we may suppose the collecti on of the Vedic hymns to have been finished.” Nor do any other of our leading scholars claim to have finally settled the vexed question, especially delicate as it is in its bearing upon the chronology of the book of Genesis . Christianity, the direct outflow of Judaism and in most cases the State religion of their respective countries, has unfortunately stood in their way. Hence, scarcely two scholars agree; and each assigns a different date to the Vedas and the Mosaic books, taking care in every case to give the latter the benefit of the doubt. Even that leader of the leaders in philological and chronological questions—Professor Müller, hardly twenty years ago, allowed himself a prudent margin by stating that it will be difficult to settle “whether the Veda is ‘the oldest of the books,’ and whether some of the portions of the Old Testament may not be traced back to the same or even an earlier date than the oldest hymns of the Vedas .” The Theosophist is, therefore, quite warranted in either adopting or rejecting as it"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"pleases the so-called authoritative chronology of science. Do we err then, in confessing that we rather incline to accept the chronology of that renowned Vedic scholar, Swami Dayânanda Saraswati, who unquestionably knows what he is talking about, has the four Vedas by heart, is perfectly familiar with all Sanskrit literature, has no such scruples as the Western Orientalists in regard to public feelings, nor desire to humour the superstitious notions of the majority, nor has any object to gain in suppressing 112  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS facts? W e are only too conscious of the risk in withholding our adulation from scienti f ic authorities. Yet, with the common temerity of the heterodox we must take our course, even though, like the Tarpeia of old, we be smothered under a heap of shields—a shower of learned quotations from these “authorities.” We are far from feeling ready to adopt the absurd chronology of a Berosus or even Syncellus—though in truth they appear “absurd” only in the light of our preconceptions. But, between the extreme claims of the Brahmins and the ridiculously short periods conceded by our Orientalists for the development and full growth of that gigantic literature of the ante-Mahâbhâratan period, there ought to be a just mean. While Swami Dayânanda Saraswati asserts that “The Vedas have now ceased to be objects of study for nearly 5,000 years,” and places the first appearance of the four Vedas at an immense antiquity, Professor Müller, assigning for the composition of even the earliest among the Brâhmanas , the years from about 1000 to 800 B.C ., hardly dares, as w e have seen, to place the collection and the original composition of the Sanhitâ, of Rig-Vedic hymns, earlier than 1200 to 1500 before our era!* Whom ought we to believe; and which of the two is the better informed? Cannot this gap of several thousand years be closed, or would it be equally difficult for either of the two cited authorities to give data which would be regarded by science as thoroughly convincing? It is as easy to reach a false conclusion by the modern inductive method as to assume false premises from which to make deductions. Doubtless Professor Max Müller has good reasons for arriving at his chronological conclusions. But so has Dayânanda Saraswati Pandit. The gradual modifications, development and growth of the Sanskrit language are sure guides enough for an expert philologist. But, that there is a possibility of his having been led into error would seem to suggest itself upon considering a certain argument brought forward by Swami Dayânanda. Our respected friend and teacher maintains –––––––––– * Lecture on the Vedas. [in Chips, etc ., Vol. I.] –––––––––– A NTIQUITY OF THE V EDAS  113 "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"that both Professor Müller and Dr. Wilson have been solely guided in their researches and conclusion by the inaccurate and untrustworthy commentaries of Sayana, Mahîdhara, and Uvata; commentaries which differ diametrically from those of a far earlier period as used by himself in connection with his great work, the Veda-Bhâshya . A cry was raised at the outset of this publication that Swami’s commentary is calculated to refute Sayana and the English interpreters. “For this,” very justly remarks Pandit Dayânanda, “I cannot be blamed; if Sayana has erred, and English interpreters have chosen to take him for their guide, the delusion cannot be long maintained. Truth alone can stand, and Falsehood before growing civilization must fall.”* And if, as he claims, his Veda-Bhâshya is entirely founded on the old commentaries of the ante-Mahâbhâratan period to which the Western scholars have had no access, then, since his were the surest guides of the two classes, we cannot hesitate to follow him, rather than the best of our European Orientalists. But, apart from such prima facie evidence, we would respectfully request Professor Max Müller to solve us a riddle. Propounded by himself, it has puzzled us for over twenty years, and pertains as much to simple logic as to the chronology in question. Clear and undeviating, like the Rhone through the Geneva lake, the idea runs through the course of his lectures, from the first volume of Chips down to his last discourse. We will try to explain. All who have followed his lectures as attentively as ourselves will remember that Professor Max Müller attributes the wealth of myths, symbols and religious allegories in the Vedic hymns, as in Grecian mythology, to the early worship of nature by man. “In the hymns of the Vedas” to quote his words, “we see man left to himself to solve the riddle of this world . . . He is awakened from darkness and slumber by the light of the sun” . . . and he calls it—“his life, his breath, his brilliant Lord and Protector. He gives names to all the powers of nature, and after he has called the fire ‘Agni,’ the sunlight ‘Indra,’ the storms –––––––––– * Answe r to the Objections to the Veda-Bhâshya . –––––––––– 114  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS ‘Marut s ,’ and the dawn ‘Usha,’ they all seem to grow naturally into beings like himself , n ay, greater than himself.”* This definition of the mental state of primitive man, in the days of the very infancy of humanity, and when hardly out of its cradle—is perfect. The period to which he attributes these effusions of an infantile mind, is the Vedic period, and the time which separates us from it is, as claimed above, 3,000 years. So much impressed seems the great philologist with this idea of the mental feebleness of mankind at the time when these hymns were composed by the four venerable Rishis, that in his Introduction to the Science of Religion (p. 278) we find the Professor saying: “Do you still wonder at polytheism or at mythology? Why, they are inevitable. They are, if you like, a parler enfantin of religion. But the world has its childhood, and when it was a child it spoke as a child [ nota bene , 3,000 years ago], it"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"understood as a child, it thought as a child . . . The fault rests with us, if we insist on taking the language of children for the language of men . . . The language of antiquity is the language of childhood . . . The parler enfantin in religion is not extinct . . . as, for instance, the religion of India . . .” Having read thus far, we pause and think. At the very close of this able explanation, we meet with a tremendous difficulty, the idea of which must have never occurred to the able advocate of the ancient faiths. To one familiar with the writings and ideas of this Oriental scholar, it would seem the height of absurdity to suspect him of accepting the Biblical chronology of 6,000 years since the appearance of the first man upon earth as the basis of his calculations. And yet the recognition of such chronology is inevitable if we have to accept Professor Müller’s reasons at all; for here we run against a purely arithmetical and mathematical obstacle, a gigantic miscalculation of proportion . . . No one can deny that the growth and development of mankind—mental as well as physical—must be analogically measured by the growth and development of man. An –––––––––– * Chips fr o m a German Workshop , Vol. I, p. 68. –––––––––– A NTIQUITY OF THE V EDAS  115 anthro p ologist, if he cares to go beyond the simple consideration of the relations of man to ot h er members of the animal kingdom, has to be in a certain way a physiologist as well as an anatomist; for, as much as ethnology, it is a progressive science which can be well treated but by those who are able to follow up retrospectively the regular unfolding of human faculties and powers, assigning to each a certain period of life. Thus, no one would regard a skull in which the wisdom tooth, so-called, would be apparent, the skull of an infant. Now, according to geology, recent researches “give good reasons to believe that under low and base grades the existence of man can be traced back into the tertiary times.” In the old glacial drift of Scotland—says Professor W. Draper—“the relics of man are found along with those of the fossil elephant”; and the best calculations so far assign a period of two hundred and forty thousand years since the beginning of the last glacial period. Making a proportion between 240,000 years—the least age we can accord to the human race—and twenty-four years of a man’s life, we find that three thousand years ago, or the period of the composition of Vedic hymns, mankind would be just twenty-one—the legal age of majority, and certainly a period at which man ceases using, if he ever will, the parler enfantin or childish lisping. But, according to the views of the Lecturer, it follows that man was, three thousand years ago, at twenty-one, a foolish and undeveloped—though a very promising—infant, and at twenty-four, has become the brilliant, acute, learned, highly analytical and philosophical man of the nineteenth century. Or, still keeping our equation in view, in other words, the Professor might as well say, that an individual who was a nursing baby at 12 noon on a certain day, would at 12:20 p.m., on the same day, have become an adult speaking high wisdom instead of his parler enfantin !"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"It really seems the duty of the eminent Sanskritist and Lecturer on Comparative Theology to get out of this dilemma.

This holy place, they believe, will be revealed at the proper time, to the world. The Mahâtmas alone can now reach it, and some inhabit it. A learned Swâmi friend, and a native of Badrinâth, highly respected at Bombay, has just told us that there is a prophecy that in twenty-five years from this time Benares will begin to decline in every respect as it has long done in holiness, and, owing to the wickedness of men, will finally fall.

They have but changed their idols for poorer ones, and remain the same. [“. . . I then ascended the Tunganâth Peak”]. At Badrinâth (Northern India), on the right bank of the Bishangangâ, where the celebrated temple of Vishnu, with hot mineral springs in it, annually attracts numerous pilgrims, there is a strange tradition among the inhabitants. They believe that holy Mahâtmas (anchorites) have lived [on] the inaccessible mountain peaks, in caves of the greatest beauty for several thousand years. Their residence is approachable only through a cavern perpetually choked with snow, which forbids the approach of the curious and the skeptical. The Badrinâth peaks in this neighbourhood are above 22,000 feet high. Since the above was written one of our most respected and learned Fellows has informed us that his Guru (Preceptor) told him that while stopping at the temple of Nârâyan, on the Himâlayas, where he had passed some months, he saw therein a copper plate bearing date, with an inscription, said to have been made by Ś ankarâchârya, that that temple was the extr em e limit where one should go in ascending the Himâlayas. The Guru also said that farther up the heights, and beyond apparently insurmountable walls of snow and ice, he several times saw men of a most venerable appearance, such as the Aryan Rishis are represented, wearing hair so long as to hang below their 122  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS waist.

The Vandals—whether Slavic Wends, or some barbarous nation of Germanic race—came at all events from the North. A recent occurrence is calculated to make us regret that Justinian did not destroy them all; for it appears that there are still in the North worthy scions left of those terrible destroyers of monuments of arts and sciences, in the persons of certain Russian merchants who have just perpetrated an act of inexcusable vandalism. According to the late Russian papers, the Moscow archmillionaire, Kokoreff, with his Tiflis partner the Armenian Croesus, Mirzoeff, is desecrating and apparently about to totally destroy perhaps the oldest relic in the world of Zoroastrianism—the “Attesh-Gag” of Baku.* Few foreigners, and perhaps as few Russians, know anything of this venerable sanctuary of the Fire-worshippers around the Caspian Sea. About twenty versts from the small town of Baku in the valley of Absharon in Russian Georgia, and among the barren, desolated steppes of the shores of the Caspian, there stands—alas! rather stood, but a few months ago—a strange structure, something between a mediaeval Cathedral and a fortified castle. It was built in unknown –––––––––– * Attesh-Kudda also. –––––––––– P ERSIAN Z OROASTRIANISM  123 ages, and b y builders as unknown. Over an area of somewhat more than a square mile, a tract known as the “Fiery Field,” upon which the structure stands, if one but digs from two to three inches into the sandy earth, and applies a lighted match, a jet of fire will stream up, as if from a spout.* The “Gheber Temple,” as the building is sometimes termed, is carved out of one solid rock. It comprises an enormous square enclosed by crenelated walls, and at the centre of the square, a high tower also rectangular resting upon four gigantic pillars. The latter were pierced vertically down to the bed-rock and the cavities were continued up to the battlements where they opened out into the atmosphere; thus forming continuous tubes through which the inflammable gas stored up in the heart of the mother-rock was conducted to the top of the tower. This tower has been for centuries a shrine of the fire-worshippers and bears the symbolical representation of the trident—called teersoot .

Under the tower-altar, three huge bells were hung. A legend says that they were miraculously produced by a holy traveller, in the tenth century during the Mussulman persecution, to warn the faithful of the approach of the enemy. But a few weeks ago, the tall tower-altar was yet ablaze with the same flame that local tradition affirms had been kindled thirty centuries ago. At the horizontal orifices in the four hollow pillars burned four perpetual fires, fed uninterruptedly from the inexhaustible subterranean reservoir.

And as the luminary—the “Eye of Ahura-Mazda”—sank lower and lower down the horizon, their voices grew lower and softer, until the chant sounded like a plaintive and subdued murmur . . .

Thousands of pilgrims came and went; for no true Gheber could die happy unless he had performed the sacred pilgrimage at least once during his life-time. A traveller—Koch—who visited the cloister about that time, found in it but five Zoroastrians, with their pupils. In 1878, about fourteen months ago, a lady of Tiflis, who visited the Attesh-Gag, mentioned in a private letter that she found there but one solitary hermit, who emerges from his cell but to meet the rising and salute the departing sun.

Kokoreff and Co. have leased the whole field from the Government, and the latter seems to feel quite indifferent over this idiotic and useless Vandalism. It is now more than twenty years since the writer visited for the last time Attesh-Gag. In those days besides a small group of recluses it had the visits of many pilgrims. And since it is more than likely that ten years hence, people will hear no more of it, I may just as well give a few more details of its history. Our Parsee friends will, I am sure, feel an interest in a few legends gathered by me on the spot. There s eems to be indeed a veil drawn over the origin of Attesh-Gag. Historical data are scarce an d contradictory. With the exception of some old Armenian Chronicles which mention it incidentally as having existed before Christianity was brought into the country by Saint Nina during the third century,* there is no other mention of it anywhere else so far as I know. –––––––––– * Though Saint Nina appeared in Georgia in the third, it is not before the fifth century that the idolatrous Grouzines [Georgians] were converted to Christianity by the thirteen Syrian Fathers. They came under the leadership of both St. Anthony and St. John of Zedadzene—so called, because he is alleged to have travelled to the Caucasian regions on purpose to fight and conquer the chief idol Zeda ! And thus, while—as incontrovertible proof of the existence of both—the opulent tresses of the black hair of St. Nina are being preserved to this day as relics, in Zion Cathedral at Tiflis—the thaumaturgic John has immortalized –––––––––– 126  B LAVAT S KY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Tradition i nforms us—how far correctly is not for me to decide—that long before Zarathushtra, the people, who now are called in contempt, by the Mussulmans and Christians, –––––––––– his name s till more. Zeda , who was the Baal of the Trans-Caucasus, had children sacrificed to him, as the legend tells us, on the top of the Zedadzene mount, about 18 versts from Tiflis. It is there that the Saint defied the idol, or rather Satan under the guise of a stone statue—to single combat, and miraculously conquered him; i . e ., threw down, and trampled upon the idol. But he did not stop there in the exhibition of his powers. The mountain peak is of an immense height, and being only a barren rock at its top, spring water is nowhere to be found on its summit. But in commemoration of his triumph, the Saint had a spring appear at the very bottom of the deep, and—as people assert—a fathomless well, dug down into the very bowels of the mountain, and the gaping mouth of which was situated near the altar of the god Zeda, just in the centre of his temple. It was into this opening that the limbs of the murdered infants were cast down after the sacrifice. The miraculous spring,"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"however, was soon dried up, and for many centuries there appeared no water. But, when Christianity was firmly established, the water began re-appearing on the 7th day of every May, and continues to do so till the present time. Strange to say, this fact does not pertain to the domain of legend, but is one that has provoked an intense curiosity even among men of science, such as the eminent geologist, Dr. Otto W. von Abich, who resided for years at Tiflis. Thousands upon thousands proceed yearly upon pilgrimage to Zedadzene on the seventh of May; and all witness the “miracle.” From early morning, water is heard bubbling down at the rocky bottom of the well; and, as noon approaches, the parched-up walls of the mouth become moist, and clear cold sparkling water seems to come out from every porosity of the rock; it rises higher and higher, bubbles, increases, until at last having reached to the very brim, it suddenly stops, and a prolonged shout of triumphant joy bursts from the fanatical crowd.

There are necks wrung and heads broken on that day at Zedadzene, but everyone who survives carries home a provision of the crystal fluid.

Not a drop of water, nor a trace of any spring, could be found by the engineers and geologists bent upon discovering the “trick.” For a whole year, the sanctuary remains deserted, and there is not even a janitor to watch the poor shrine.

Who will explain the puzzle? –––––––––– P ERSIAN Z OROASTRIANISM  127 “ G h e b e r s ,” and who term themselves “Behedin” (followers of the true faith), recognized Mithra, the Mediator, as their sole and highest God—who included within himself all the good as well as the bad gods. Mithra, representing the two natures of Ormazd and Ahriman combined, the people feared him, whereas, they would have had no need of fearing, but only of loving and reverencing him as Ahura-Mazda, were Mithra without the Ahriman element in him. One day as the god, disguised as a shepherd, was wandering about the earth, he came to Baku, then a dreary, deserted seashore, and found an old devotee of his quarrelling with his wife. Upon this barren spot wood was scarce, and she would not give up a certain portion of her stock of cooking fuel to be burned upon the altar. So the Ahriman element was aroused in the god and, striking the stingy old woman, he changed her into a gigantic rock. Then, the Ahura-Mazda element prevailing, he, to console the bereaved widower, promised that neither he, nor his descendants, should ever need fuel any more, for he would provide such a supply as should last till the end of time. So he struck the rock again and then struck the ground for miles around, and the earth and the calcareous soil of the Caspian shores were filled up to the brim with naphtha. To commemorate the happy event, the old devotee assembled all the youths of the neighbourhood and set himself to excavating the rock—which was all that remained of his ex-wife. He cut the battlemented walls, and fashioned the altar and the four pillars, hollowing them all to allow the gases to rise up and escape through the top of the merlons. The god Mithra upon seeing the work ended, sent a lightning flash, which set ablaze the fire upon the altar, and lit up every merlon upon the walls. Then, in order that it should burn the brighter, he called forth the four winds and ordered them to blow the flame in every direction. To this day, Baku is known under its primitive name of “Badlube,” which means literally the gathering of winds.* The other legend, which is but a continuation of the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"–––––––––– * [Cf.

He sang the praises of the One but Triple god—the supreme Eternal, the incomprehensible essence “Zervana-Akerene,” which emanating from itself “Primeval Light,” the latter in its turn produced Ahura-Mazda. But this process required that the “Primeval One” should previously absorb in itself all the light from the fiery Mithra, and thus left the poor god despoiled of all his brightness. Losing his right of undivided supremacy, Mithra, in despair, and instigated by his Ahrimanian nature, annihilated himself for the time being, leaving Ahriman alone, to fight out his quarrel with Ormazd, the best way he could. Hence, the prevailing Duality in nature since that time until Mithra returns; for he promised to his faithful devotees to come back some day. Only since then, a series of calamities fell upon the Fire-worshippers. The last of these was the invasion of their country by the Moslems in the 7th century, when these fanatics commenced most cruel persecutions against the Behedin. Driven away from every quarter, the Ghebers found refuge but in the province of Kerman, and in the city of Yezd. Then followed heresies. Many of the Zoroastrians abandoning the faith of their forefathers, became Moslems; others, in their unquenchable hatred for the new rulers, joined the ferocious Koords and became devil, as well as fire-worshippers. These are the Yezidis. The whole religion of these strange sectarians—with the exception of a few who have more weird rites, which are a secret to all but to themselves—consists in the following. As soon as the morning sun appears, they place their two thumbs crosswise one upon the other, kiss the symbol, and touch with them their brow in reverential silence. Then they salute the sun and turn back into their tents. They believe in the power of the Devil, dread it, and propitiate the “fallen angel” by every means; getting very angry whenever they hear him spoken of disrespectfully by either a Mussulman or a Christian. Murders have been committed P ERSIAN Z OROASTRIANISM  129 by them on a ccount of such irreverent talk, but people have become more prudent of late. With the exception of the Bombay community of Parsees, Fire-worshippers are, then, to be found but in the two places before mentioned, and scattered around Baku. In Persia some years ago, according to statistics they numbered about 100,000 men;* I doubt, though, whether their religion has been preserved as pure as even that of the Gujerati Parsees, adulterated as is the latter by the errors and carelessness of generations of uneducated Mobeds. And yet, as is the case of their Bombay brethren, who are considered by all the travellers as well as Anglo-Indians, as the most intelligent, industrious and well-behaved community of the native races, the fire-worshippers of Kerman and Yezd bear a very high character among the Persians, as well as among the Russians of Baku.

In his Preface he expresses the hope that the present work and his “ Indian Song of Songs will preserve the memory of one who loved India and the Indian peoples.” The hope is well grounded, for if any Western poet has earned the right to grateful remembrance by Asiatic nations and is destined to live in their memory, it is the author of the Light of Asia . The novelty, and, from a Christian standpoint, the distastefulness of the mode of treatme n t of the subject seems to have already taken one reviewer’s breath away. Describing the volume as “gorgeous in yellow and gold” he thinks the book “chiefly valuable as . . . coming from one who during a long residence in India imbued his mind with Buddhistic philosophy.” This, he adds, “is no criticism of a religion supposed to be false, but the sympathetic presentment of a religion so much of which is true as from the mouth of a votary [ sic ].” By many, Mr. Arnold’s “imaginary Buddhist votary” of the Preface, is identified with the author himself; who now—to quote again his critic—“comes out in his true colours.” We are glad of it; it is a rare compliment to pay to any writer of this generation, whose peremptory instincts lead but too many to sail under any colours but their own. For our part, we regard the poem as a really remarkable specimen of literary talent, replete with philosophical thought and religious feeling—just the book, in short, we needed in our period of Science of Religion— and the general toppling of ancient gods. The Miltonic verse of the poem is rich, simple, yet powerful, without any of those"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"metaphysical innuendoes at the expense of clear meaning which the subject might seem to beg, and which is so much favored by some of our modern English poets.

Jar as it may on Christian ears, the theme chosen by M r. Arnold is one of the grandest possible. It is as worthy of his pen, as the poet has showed himself worthy of the subject. There is a unity of Oriental colouring in the descriptive portion of the work, a truthfulness of motive evinced in the masterly handling of Buddha’s character, which are as precious as unique; inasmuch as they present this character for the first time in the history of Western literature, in the totality of its unadulterated beauty. The moral grandeur of the hero, that Prince of royal blood, who might have been the “Lord of Lords,” yet “. . . . . . let the rich world slip Out if his grasp, to hold a beggar’s bowl,” and the development of his philosophy, the fruit of years of solitary meditation and struggle with the m o rtal “Self,” are exquisitely portrayed. Toward the end the poem culminates in a triumphant cry of all nature; a universal hymn at the sight of the World-liberating soul “The Scripture of the Saviour of the World, Lord Budd h a—Prince Siddhârtha styled on earth— In Earth and Heavens and Hells Incomparable, All-honoured, Wisest, Best, most Pitiful; The Teacher of Nirvana and the Law.”* Whatever the subsequent fate of all the world’s religions and their founders, the name of Gautama B u ddha, or Ś âkya Muni,† can never be forgotten; it must always live in the ––– –– ––––– * [This, h owever, is the opening of Book the First in the poem.— Compiler .] † He belonged to the family of the Ś âkyas, who were descendants of Ikshvâku and formed one of the num er ous branches of the Solar dynasty; the race which entered India about 2,300 years B.C. “according to the epic poems of India.

Not only our philologists—cold anatomists of time-honoured creeds who scientifically dissect the victims of their critical analysis—but even those who are prepossessed against his faith, have ever found but words of praise for Gautama. Nothing can be higher or purer than his social and moral code. “That moral code,” says Max Müller, “taken by itself is one of the most perfect which the world has ever known.”* In his work Le Bouddha et sa religion (p. 5) Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire reaches the climax of reverential praise. He does not “hesitate to say” that “among the founders of religions there is no figure more pure or more touching than that of Buddha. His life has not a stain upon it . His constant heroism equals his convictions . . . He is the perfect model of all the virtues he preaches; his abnegation and charity, his inalterable gentleness, never forsake him for an instant . . .” And, when his end approaches, it is in the arms of his disciples that he dies, “with the serenity of a sage who practiced good during his whole life, and who is sure to have found—the truth.” So true is it, that even the early Roman Catholic saint-makers, with a flippant unconcern for detection by posterity characteristic of the early periods of Christianity, claimed him as one of their converts, and, under the –––––––––– * “ B u d d h ism,” in Chips from a German Workshop , Vol. I, p. 217. –––––––––– 134  B LAVA T SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS pseudon y m of St. Josaphat, registered him in their Golden Legend and Martyrology as an orthodox, beatified Catholic saint.

Its title is La Châine Magnétique (The Magnetic Chain). After long years of comparative indifference, caused by the encroachments of sceptical science, this fascinating subject is again absorbing a large share of the attention of Western students of Psychology. Mesmerism is the very key to the mystery of man’s interior nature; and enables one familiar with its laws to understand not only the phenomena of Western Spiritualism, but also that vast subject—so vast as to embrace every branch of Occultism within itself—of Eastern Magic. The whole object of the Hindu Yoga is to bring into activity his interior power, to make himself ruler over physical self and over everything else besides. That the developed Yogi can influence, sometimes control, the operations of vegetable and animal life, proves that the soul within his body has an intimate relationship with the soul of all other things. Mesmerism goes far toward teaching us how to read this occult secret, and Baron Reichenbach’s great discovery of Odyle or Od force, together with Professor Buchanan’s Psychometry , and the recent advances in electrical and magnetic science complete the demonstration. The Theosophist will give great attention to all these—Mesmerism, the laws of Od , Psychometry, etc. In this connection we give translated extracts from La Châine Magnétique that will repay perusal. There is a great truth in what Baron Du Potet says about the Mesmeric fluid: 136  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS It is no utopian theory, but a universal Force, ever the same; which we will irrefutably prove. . . . A law of n ature as positive as electricity, yet different from it; as real as night and day. A law of which physicians, notwithstanding all their learning and science, have hitherto been ignorant. Only with a knowledge of magnetism does it become possible to prolong life and heal the sick. Physicians must study it some day or—cease to be regarded as physicians. Though now almost a nonogenarian, the Baron’s intellect is as clear and his courageous devotio n to his favourite Science, as ardent as when, in the year 1826, he appeared before the French Academy of Medicine and experimentally demonstrated the reality of animal magnetism. France, the mother of so many great men of science, has produced few greater than Du Potet.

The value of such articles as these latter is that they afford to the psychologist material for comparison with the current Western mediumistic phenomena. Heretofore, there have been, we may say, very few observations upon East Indian spiritualism, of any scientific value.

They are H. Sumangala, High Priest of Adam’s Peak, Ceylon, the most venerated of Buddhistic monasteries; and Mohottiwatte Gunananda, superior of the Vihâra Dipadattama, at Colombo, Ceylon. The former is recognized by European philologists as the most learned of all the representatives of his faith; in fact, Dr. Muir of Edinburgh recently called him a polyglot, so extensive and accurate is his knowledge of languages and philosophies. His eminence as an instructor is also shown in his occupancy of the position of President of the Elu, Pali, and Sanskrit, College Vidyodaya. As a preacher and expositor of doctrine he is no less distinguished, while his personal character is so pure and winsome that even the bigoted enemies of his religion vie with each other in praising him. In the year 1867 a synod of the Buddhist clergy, called to fix the text of the Sûtras and Pitakas , was presided over by him. When it was decided to reorganize the Theosophical Society upon the basis of a Universal Brotherhood of humanity, uniting men of all creeds in an effort to spread throughout the world the basic principles of a true religion, he cheerfully gave his adhesion to the movement, and accepted a place in the General Council; thus dignifying the Society and securing it the good-will of Buddhists, the world over. Far from asking that it should be given a sectarian character and made a propaganda of Buddhism, he sent his “respectful and fraternal salutation to our brethren in Bombay” in his letter B UDDHISTIC E XEGESIS  139 of accep t ance, and has shown from first to last the disposition to assist unreservedly and cordially our labours.

Six or more times he has met the chosen debaters of the Missionaries before vast assemblages of natives, to discuss the respective merits of the two religions, and was never yet worsted. In fact, it is only too evident in the admissions of Christian papers that he silenced his adversaries by his searching analysis of Bible history and doctrines, and his exposition of the Law of Buddha.

In all, Priest Mohottiwatte—or, as he is popularly termed in Ceylon, Megittuwatte— has preached over 5,000 discourses upon the Buddhistic religion, and devoted the whole strength of his noble heart to his sacred mission. His interest in our Society is as sincere as Sumangala’s, and his ardor in promoting its influence characteristic of all he does. He has no reluctance whatever to co-operate with our Aryan, Brahmanic, Parsi, Jain, and Hebrew members in carrying on our work. “We feel happier than can be described,” he writes, “to learn about the cordial receptions given you by the brothers in London and by the natives of India. I am sorry that, without putting my congregation and myself to great inconvenience, I cannot be present in person at the meeting with Swami Dayânanda. But I enclose a letter signed by the Rev. Sumangala, the High Priest, and myself, recording our unqualified approbation of your kind suggestion to place us as representatives of our faith in your Oriental Council.” In another letter to Colonel Olcott, he says, “We are rejoiced to know that such a learned, good and influential gentleman as 140  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS D a y â n a n d a S araswati Swami, is every way favourably disposed towards you.” Such men as these two worthily exemplify the divine doctrines of Ś âkya Muni. In the whole experience of the officers of the Theosophical Society, no incident has been more cheering and delightful, than the friendliness with which their advances have been met by the Buddhists. If we had been brothers long separated, our greeting could not have been warmer. Says the venerable Chief Priest, Sumana Tissa, of the Paramananda Vihâra, near Point de Galle—now in his sixty-sixth year—“To use an Oriental simile, I and my many disciples anxiously wait your arrival, as a swarm of peacocks joyously long for the downpour of a shower.” We trust that our duties will permit us before long to meet all our Sinhalese brothers in person, and exchange congratulations over the encouraging prospects of our peaceful humanitarian mission. ———— "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME II 1879 A THUNDER CLOUD WITH SILVER LINING [ The Theosophist , Vol. I, No. 2, November, 1879, pp. 34-35] “All comes in good time to him who knows to wait,” says the proverb.

It will be remembered that in the beginning of this year, their feelings were deeply hurt on the occasion of a trip they m ade up-country by an insulting espionage set on foot against them by the police. It appears that some groundless calumny had preceded them to this country, and that the police put a very clumsy construction upon certain orders they received from Government respecting the new arrivals. However, since then the subject has been brought especially to the Viceroy’s notice, and, satisfied that the Theosophists were misrepresented in the first instance , he has given formal orders, through the Political Department, to the effect that they are not to be any longer subject to interference.

At the first apprehension that idle rumour might become a reality, these were the swiftest to desert us.

Schliemann found it in terra cotta disks, on the site, as he believes, of ancient Troy, in the lowest stratum of his excavations; which indicated, according to Dr. Lundy, “an Aryan civilization long anterior to the Greek—say from two to three thousand years B.C.” Burnouf calls it the oldest form of the cross known, and affirms that it is found personified in the ancient religion of the Greeks under the figure of Prometheus “the fire-bearer,” crucified on Mount Caucasus, while the celestial bird—the Śyena of the Vedic hymns—daily devours his entrails.

And yet they appear none the less pagans than they were before, for this is how they meet Christmas and the New Year’s day. To this time they call this festival Survaki , as it falls in with the festival in honour of the ancient Slavonian god Surva .

This custom has remained among them in all its primitive heathenism, and though it varies according to localities, yet the rites and ceremonies are essentially the same. On the eve of New Year’s day the Bulgarians do no work, and are obliged to fast. Young betrothed maidens are busy preparing a large platiy (cake) in which they place roots and young shoots of various forms, to each of which a name is given according to the shape of the root. Thus, one means the “house,” and another represents the “garden”; others again, the mill, the vineyard, the horse, a cat, a hen, and so on, according to the landed property and worldly possessions of the family. Even articles of value such as jewelry and bags of money are represented in this emblem of the horn of abundance. Besides all these, a large and ancient silver coin is placed inside the cake; it is called babka and is tied two ways with a red thread, which forms a cross. This coin is regarded as the symbol of fortune. After sunset, and other ceremonies, including prayers addressed in the direction of the departing luminary, the whole family assemble about a large round table called paralya , on which are placed the above-mentioned cake, dry vegetables, corn, wax taper, and, finally, a large censer containing incense of the best quality to perfume the god. The head of the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"household, usually the oldest in the family either the grandfather, or the father himself—taking up the censer with the greatest veneration, in one hand, and the wax taper in the other, begins walking about the premises, incensing the four corners, beginning and ending with the East, and reads various invocations, which close with the Christian “Our Father who art in Heaven,” addressed to Surva. The taper is then laid away to be preserved throughout the whole year, till the next festival. It is thought to have acquired marvelous healing properties, and is lighted 148  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS only upo n occasions of family sickness, in which case it is expected to cure the patient. After this ceremony, the old man takes his knife and cuts the cake into as many slices as there are members of the household present. Each person, upon receiving his or her share, makes haste to open and search the piece. The happiest of the lot, for the ensuing year, is he or she who gets the part containing the old coin crossed with the scarlet thread; he is considered the elect of Surva, and every one envies the fortunate possessor. Then in order of importance come the emblems of the house, the vineyard, and so on; and according to his findings, the finder reads his horoscope for the coming year. Most unlucky he who gets the cat; he turns pale and trembles. Woe to him and misery, for he is surrounded by enemies, and has to prepare for great trials. At the same time, a large log which represents a flaming altar, is set up in the chimney place, and fire is applied to it. This log burns in honour of Surva, and is intended as an oracle for the whole house. If it burns the whole night through till morning without the flame dying out, it is a good sign; otherwise, the family prepares to see death that year, and deep lamentations end the festival. Neither the momche (young bachelor), nor the moma (the maiden), sleep that night. At midnight begins a series of soothsaying, magic, and various rites, in which the burning logs plays the part of the oracle. A young bud thrown into the fire and bursting with a loud snap, is a sign of happy and speedy marriage, and vice versa . Long after midnight, the young couples leave their respective homes, and begin visiting their acquaintances, from house to house, offering and receiving congratulations, and rendering thanks to the deity. These deputy couples are called the Survakari , and each male carries a large branch ornamented with red ribbons, old coins, and the image of Surva , and as they wend along sing in chorus.

Already two camps are forming among the votaries of scientific research. One wages war on the other, and hard words are occasionally exchanged. The apple of discord in this case is—Spiritualism. Fresh and illustrious victims are yearly decoyed away from the impregnable strongholds of materialistic negation, and ensnared into examining and testing the alleged spiritual phenomena. And we all know that when a true scientist examines them without prejudice . . . well, he generally ends like professor Hare, Mr. 150  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS William C r ookes, F.R.S., the great Alfred Russel Wallace, another F.R.S., and so many other eminent men of science—he passes over to the enemy . . . We are really curious to know what will be the new theory advanced in the present crisis by the skeptics, and how they will account for such an apostasy of several of their luminaries, as has just occ urred. The venerable accusations of non compos mentis , and “dotage” will not bear another refurbishing: the eminent perverts are increasing numerically so fast, that if mental incapacity is charged upon all of them who experimentally satisfy themselves that tables can talk sense, and mediums float through the air, it might augur ill for science; there might soon be none but weakened brains in the learned societies. They may, possibly, for a time find some consolation in accounting for the lodgement of the extraordinary “delusion” in very scholarly heads, upon the theory of atavis m— the mysterious law of latent transmission, so much favoured by the modern schools of Darwinian evolu tionism especially in Germany, as represented by that thorough-going apostle of “modern struggle for culture,” Ernst Haeckel, professor at Jena. They may attribute the belief of their colleagues in the phenomena, to certain molecular movements of the cell in the ganglia of their once powerful brains, hereditarily transmitted to them by their ignorant mediaeval ancestors. Or, again, they may split their ranks, and establishing an imperium in imperio “divid e and conquer” still. All this is possible; but time alone will show which of the parties will come off best.

So, Homer-like, we follow the combatants and condense this modern Iliad for the benefit of our friends. After several years of diligent research and investigation of the phenomena, Messrs. Wagner and Butleroff, both distinguished sav ants and professors in St. Petersburg University, became thoroughly convinced of the reality of the weird manifestations. As a result, both wrote numerous and strong articles in the leading periodicals in defense of the “mischievous epidemic”—as in his moments of “unconscious cerebration” and “prepossession” in favour of his own hobby Dr. Carpenter calls spiritualism. Both of the above eminent gentlemen are endowed with those precious qualities which are the more to be respected as they are so seldom met with among our men of science. These qualities, admitted by their critic himself—Mr. Burenin, are: (1) a serious and profound conviction that what they defend is true; (2) an unwavering courage in stating at every hazard, before a prejudiced and inimical public that such is their conviction; (3) clearness and consecutiveness in their statements; (4) the serene calmness and impartiality with which they treat the opinions of their opponents; (5) a full and profound acquaintance"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"with the subject under discussion. The combination of the qualities enumerated, adds their critic, . . . leads us to regard the recent article by Professor Butleroff, “Empericism and Dogmatism in the Domain of Mediumship,” as one of those essays whose commanding significance cannot be denied, and which are sure to strongly impress the readers. Such articles are positively rare in our periodicals; rare because of the originality of the author’s conclusions, and because of the clear, precise, and serious presentation of facts. . . . The article so eulogized may be summed up in a few words. We will not stop to enumerate the marvels of spiritual phenomena witnessed by Professor Zöllner with Dr. Slade and defended by Professor Butleroff, since they are no more marvellous than the latter gentleman’s personal WAR IN OLYMPUS  153 experience in this direction with Mr. Williams, a medium of London, in 1876. The séances t ook place in a London hotel in the room occupied by the Honorable Alexander Aksakoff, Russian Imperial Councillor, in which, with the exception of this gentleman, there were but two other persons—Professor Butleroff and the medium. Confederacy was thus utterly impossible. And now, what took place under these conditions, which so impressed one of the first scientists of Russia? Simply this: Mr. Williams, the medium, was made to sit with his hands, feet, and even his person tightly bound with cords to his chair, which was placed in a dead-wall corner of the room, behind Mr. Butleroff’s plaid hung across so as to form a screen. Williams soon fell into a kind of lethargic stupor, known among Spiritualists as the trance condition, and “spirits” began to appear before the eyes of the investigators. Various voices were heard, and loud sentences, pronounced by the “invisibles,” from every part of the room; things—toilet appurtenances and so forth, began flying in every direction through the air; and finally “John King”—a sort of king of the spooks, who has been famous for years—made his appearance bodily. But we must allow Professor Butleroff to tell his phenomenal story himself. . . . We first saw moving [he writes] several bright lights in the air, and immediately after that appeared th e f u ll f ig u re of “John King.” His apparition is generally preceded by a greenish phosphoric light which, gradually becoming brighter, illuminates, more and more, the whole bust of John King. Then it is that those present perceive that the light emanates from some kind of a luminous object held by the “spirit.” The face of a man with a thick black beard becomes clearly distinguishable; the head is enveloped in a white turban. The figure appears outside the cabinet (that is to say, the screened corner where the medium sat), and finally approaches us. We saw it each time for a few seconds; then rapidly waning, the light was extinguished and the figure became invisible to reappear again in a moment or two; then from the surrounding darkness, “John’s” voice is heard proceeding from the spot on which he had appeared mostly, though not always, when he had already disappeared. “John” asked us “what can I do for you?” and Mr. Aksakoff requested him to rise up to the ceiling and from there speak to us. In accordance with the wish expressed, the figure suddenly appeared above the table and towered majestically above our heads to the ceiling which became all illuminated, with the luminous object held in the spirit’s hand; when "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"154  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS “John” was quite under the ceiling he shouted down to us: “Will that do?” During another séance M. Butleroff asked “John” to approach him quite near, which the “spirit” did, and so gave him the opportunity of seeing clearly “the sparkling, clear eyes of John.” Another spirit, “Peter,” though he never put in a visible appearance during the séances , yet conversed with Messrs. Butleroff and Aksakoff, wrote for them on paper furnished by them, and so forth. Though the learned professor minutely enumerates all the precautions he had taken against possible fraud, the critic is not yet satisfied, and asks, pertinently enough: . . . Why did not the respectable savant catch “John” in his arms, when the spirit was but at a foot’s distance from him? Again, why did not both Messrs. Aksakoff and Butleroff try to get hold of “John’s” legs, when he was mounting to the ceiling? Indeed they ought to have done all this, if they are really so anxious to learn the truth for their own sake, as for that of science, which they struggle to lead on toward the domains of the “other world.” And, had they complied with such a simple and, at the same time, very little scientific test, there would be no more need for them, perhaps, to . . . further explain the scientific importance of the spiritual manifestations. That this importance is not exaggerated, and has as much significance for the world of science, as for that of religious thought, is proved by so many philosophical minds speculating upon the modern “delusion.” This is what Fichte, the learned German savant , says of it. . . . Modern spiritualism chiefly proves the existence of that which, in common parlance, is very vaguely and inaptly termed “ apparition of spirits .” If we concede the reality of such apparitions, then they become an undeniable, practical proof of the continuation of our personal, conscious existence (beyond the portals of death). And such a tangible, fully demonstrated fact cannot be otherwise but beneficent in this epoch, which, having fallen into a dreary denial of immortality, thinks, in the proud self-sufficiency of its vast intellect, that it has already happily left behind it every superstition of the kind.” If such a tangible evidence could be really found, and demonstrated to us, beyond any doubt or cavil, reasons Fichte further on— . . . if the reality of the continuation of our lives after death were WAR IN OLYMPUS  155 furnished us upon positive proof, in strict accordance with the logical elements of experimental natural sciences, then it would be, indeed, a result with which, owing to its nature and peculiar signification for humanity, no other result to be met with in all the history of civilization could be compared. The old problem about man’s destination upon earth would be thus solved, and consciousness in humanity would be elevated one step. That which, hitherto, could be revealed to man but in the domain of blind faith, presentiment, and passionate hope, would become to him—positive knowledge; he would have acquired the certainty that he was a member of an eternal, a spiritual world, in which he would continue living, and that his temporary existence upon this earth forms but a fractional portion of a future eternal life, and that it is only there that he would be enabled to perceive, and fully comprehend his real destination. Having acquired this profound conviction, mankind would be thoroughly impressed with a new and animating comprehension of life, and its intellectual perceptions opened to an idealism strong with incontrovertible facts. This would prove tantamount to a complete reconstruction of man in relation to his existence as an entity and mission upon earth; it would be, so to say, a “new birth.” Whoever has lost all inner convictions as to his eternal destination, his faith in eternal life, whether the case be that of an"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"isolated individuality, a whole nation, or the representative of a certain epoch, he or it may be regarded as having had uprooted, and to the very core, all sense of that invigorating force which alone lends itself to self-devotion and to progress. Such a man becomes what was inevitable—an egotistical, selfish, sensual being, concerned wholly for his self-preservation. His culture, his enlightenment, and civilization, can serve him but as a help and ornamentation toward that life of sensualism, or at best, to guard him from all that can harm it. Such is the enormous importance attributed by Professor Fichte and Professor Butleroff of Germany and Russia to the spiritual phenomena; and we may say the feeling is more than sincerely echoed in England by Mr. A. R. Wallace, F.R.S. (See his Miracles and Modern Spiritualism .) An influential American scientific journal uses an equally strong language when speaking of the value that a scientific demonstration of the survival of the human soul would have for the world. If Spiritualism prove true, it says, . . . it will become the one grand event of the world’s history; it will give an imperishable lustre of glory to the Nineteenth Century. Its discoverer will have no rival in renown, and his name will be written high above any other. . . . If the pretensions of Spiritualism have a 156  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS rational foundation, no more important work has been offered to men of Science than their verification.* And now we will see what the stubborn Russian critic (who seems to be but the mouthpiece of European materialistic science) has to say in response to the unanswerable arguments and logic of Messrs. Fichte and Butleroff. If scepticism has no stronger arguments to oppose to Spiritualism but the following original paradox, then we will have to declare it worsted in the dispute. Instead of the beneficial results foretold by Fichte in the case of the final triumph of Spiritualism, the critic forecasts quite a different state of things. . . . As soon [he says] as such scientific methods shall have demonstrated, beyond doubt or cavil, to the general satisfaction that our world is crammed with souls of men who have preceded us, and whom we will all join in turn; as soon as it shall be proven that these “souls of the deceased” can communicate with mortals, all the earthly physical science of the eminent scholars will vanish like a soap-bubble, and will have lost all its interest for us living men. Why should people care for their proportionately short life upon earth, once that they have the positive assurance and conviction of another life to come after the bodily death; a death which does not in the least preclude conscious relations with the world of the living, or even their post-mortem participation in all its interests? Once, that with the help of science, based on mediumistic experiments and the discoveries of Spiritualism, such relations shall have been firmly established, they will naturally become with every day more and more intimate; an extraordinary friendship will ensue between this and the “other” worlds; that other world will begin divulging to this one the most occult mysteries of life and death, and the hitherto most inaccessible laws of the universe—those which now exact the greatest efforts of man’s mental powers. Finally, nothing will remain for us in this temporary world to either do or desire, but to pass away as soon as possible into the world of eternity. No inventions , no observations , no sciences , will be any more needed !! Why should people exercise their brains, for instance, in perfecting the telegraphs, when nothing else will be required but to be on good terms with spirits in order to avail of their services for the instantaneous transmission of thoughts and objects, not only from Europe to America, but even to the moon, if so desired?

The learned and scholarly phantasists who are so anxious to promote the science of Spiritualism, i . e ., of a close communication between the two worlds, ought to bear the above in mind. To which, the “scholarly phantasists” would be quite warranted in answering that one would have to bring his own mind to the exact measure of microscopic capacity required to elaborate such a theory as this, before he could take it into consideration at all. Is the above meant to be offered as an objection for serious consideration? Strange logic! We are asked to believe that, because these men of science, who now believe in naught but matter, and thus try to fit every phenomenon—even of a mental, and spiritual character—within the Procrustean bed of their own preconceived hobbies, would find themselves, by the mere strength of circumstances forced, in their turn, to fit these cherished hobbies to truth , however unwelcome, and to facts wherever found—that because of that, science will lose all its charm for humanity. Nay—life itself will become a burden! There are millions upon millions of people who, without believing in Spiritualism at all, yet have faith in another and a better world. And were that blind faith to become positive knowledge indeed, it could but better humanity. Before closing his scathing criticism upon the “credulous men of science ,” our reviewer sends one more bomb in their direction, which unfortunately like many other explosive shells misses the culprits and wounds the whole group of their learned colleagues. We translate the missile verbatim this time for the benefit of all the European and American academicians. . . . The eminent professor [he adds, speaking of Butleroff, and his article] among other things, makes the most of the strange fact that Spiritualism gains with every day more and more converts within the corporation of our great scientists. He enumerates a long list of English and German names among illustrious men of science, who have more or less confessed themselves in favor of the spiritual doctrines. Among these names we find such as are quite authoritative, those of the greatest luminaries of science. Such a fact is, to say the 158  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS least, very striking, and in any case, lends a great weight to Spiritualism. But we have only to ponder coolly over it, to come very easily to the conclusion that it is just among such great men of science that Spiritualism is most likely to spread and find ready converts . With all their powerful intellects and gigantic knowledge, our great scholars are firstly, men of sedentary habits, and, secondly, they are, with scarcely an exception, men with diseased and shattered nerves , inclined toward an abnormal development of an overstrained brain . Such sedentary men are the easiest to hoodwink ; a clever charlatan will make an easier prey of , and bamboozle with far more facility a scholar than an unlearned but practical man . Hallucination will far sooner get hold of persons inclined to nervous receptivity, especially if they once concentrate themselves upon some peculiar ideas, or a favourite hobby. This, I believe, will explain the fact that we see so many men of science enrolling themselves in the army of Spiritualists. We need not stop to enquire how Messrs. Tyndall, Huxley, Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Lewes, and other eminent scientific and philosophical sceptics, will like such a prospect of rickety ganglionic centres, collective softening of the brain, and the resulting “hallucinations.” The argument is not impertinent naïvete , but a literary monstrosity."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"We are far from agreeing entirely with the views of Professor Butleroff, or even Mr. Wallace, as to the agencies at work behind the modern phenomena; yet between the extremes of spiritual negation and affirmation, there ought to be a middle ground; only pure philosophy can establish truth upon firm principles; and no philosophy can be complete unless it embraces both physics and metaphysics. Mr. Tyndall, who declares ( Science and Man ) that “Metaphysics will be welcomed when it abandons its pretensions to scientific discovery, and consents to be ranked as a kind of poetry,” opens himself to the criticism of posterity. Meanwhile, he must not regard it as an impertinence if his spiritualistic opponents retort with the answer that “physics will always be welcomed, when it abandons its pretension to psychological discovery.” The physicists will have to consent to be regarded in a near future as no more than supervisors and analysts of physical results, who have to leave the spiritual causes to those who believe in them. Whatever the issue of the present quarrel, we fear, though, that Spiritualism has made its appearance a century too late. Our WAR IN OLYMPUS  159 age is pre-eminently one of extremes. The earnest and philosophical, yet reverent doubter s are few, and the name for those who rush to the opposite extreme is Legion. We are the children of our century. Thanks to that same law of atavism, it seems to have inherited from its parent—the eighteenth—the century of both Voltaire and Jonathan Edwards—all its extreme scepticism, and, at the same time, religious credulity and bigoted intolerance. Spiritualism is an abnormal and premature outgrowth, standing between the two; and, though it stands right on the highway to truth, its ill-defined beliefs make it wander on through by-paths which lead to anything but philosophy. Its future depends wholly upon the timely help it can receive from honest science—that science which scorns no truth. It was, perhaps, when thinking of the opponents of the latter, that Alfred de Musset wrote the following magnificent apostrophe: “Sleepest thou content, Voltaire; And thy dread smile hovers it still above Thy fleshless bones . . . ? Thine age they call too young to understand thee, This one should suit thee better— Thy men are born!

When this paper reaches its Western subscribers there will be festivity and rejoicing in every house. In North-Western Europe and in America the holly and ivy will decorate each home, and the churches be decked with evergreens; a custom derived from the ancient practices of the pagan Druids “that sylvan spirits might flock to the evergreens, and remain unnipped by frost till a milder season.” In Roman Catholic countries large crowds flock during the whole evening and night of “Christmas Eve” to the churches, to salute waxen images of the divine Infant and his Virgin mother, in her garb of “Queen of Heaven.” To an analytical mind, this bravery of rich gold and lace, pearl-embroidered satin and velvet, and the bejewelled cradle do seem rather paradoxical. When one thinks of the poor, worm-eaten, dirty manger of the Jewish country-inn, in which, if we must credit the Gospel, the future “Redeemer” was placed at his birth for lack of a better shelter, we cannot help suspecting that before the dazzled eyes of the unsophisticated devotee the Bethlehem stable vanishes altogether. To put it in the mildest terms, this gaudy display tallies ill with the democratic feelings and the truly divine contempt for riches of the “Son of Man,” who had “not where to lay his head.” It makes it all the harder for the average Christian to regard the explicit statement that—“it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven,” as CHRISTMAS THEN AND CHRISTMAS NOW  163 anything more than a rhetorical threat. The Roman Church acted wisely in severely forbidding her parishioners to either read or interpret the Gospels for themselves, and leaving the Book, as long as it was possible, to proclaim its truths in Latin—“the voice of one crying in the wilderness.” In that, she but followed the wisdom of the ages the wisdom of the old Aryans, which is also “justified of her children”; for, as neither the modern Hindu devotee understands a word of Sanskrit, nor the modern Parsi one syllable of the Zend, so for the average Roman Catholic the Latin is no better than Hieroglyphics. The result is that all the three— Brahmanical High Priest, Zoroastrian Mobed, and Roman Catholic Pontiff, are allowed unlimited opportunities for evolving new religious dogmas out of the depths of their own fancy, for the benefit of their respective churches. To usher in this great day the bells are set merrily ringing at midnight, throughout England and the Continent. In France and Italy, after the celebration of the Mass in churches magnificently decorated, “it is usual for the revellers to partake of a collation ( réveillon ) that they may be better able to sustain the fatigues of the night, ” saith a book treating upon Popish church ceremonials. This night of Christian fasting reminds one of the Śivarâtri of the followers of the god Śiva, —the great day of gloom and fasting, in the eleventh month of the Hindu year. Only, with the latter, the night’s long vigil is preceded and followed by a strict and rigid fasting. No réveillons or compromises for them. True, they are but wicked “heathens,” and therefore their way to salvation must be tenfold harder. Though now universally observed by Christian nations as the anniversary of the birth of Jesus, the 25th of December was not originally so accepted. The most movable of the Christian feast days, during the early centuries, Christmas was often confounded with the Epiphany, and celebrated in the months of April and"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"May. As there never was any authentic record, or proof of its identification, whether in secular or ecclesiastical history, the selection of that day long remained optional; and it was only during the fourth century that, urged by Cyril of Jerusalem, the 164  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Pope (Julius I) ordered the bishops to make an investigation and come finally to some agreement as to the presumable date of the nativity of Christ. Their choice fell upon the 25th day of December—and a most unfortunate choice it has since proved! It was Dupuis, followed by Volney, who aimed the first shots at this natal anniversary. They proved that for incalculable periods before our era, upon very clear astronomical data, nearly all the ancient peoples had celebrated the births of their sun-gods on that very day. “Dupuis says, that the celestial sign of the VIRGIN AND CHILD was in existence several thousand years before the birth of Christ”—remarks Higgins in his Anacalypsis . * As Dupuis, Volney, and Higgins have all been passed over to posterity as infidels, and enemies of Christianity, it may be as well to quote, in this relation, the confessions of the Christian Bishop of Ratisbone, “the most learned man that the Middle Ages produced”—the Dominican, Albertus Magnus. “The sign of the celestial virgin rises above the horizon at the moment in which we fix the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ ,” he says.† So Adonis, Bacchus, Osiris, Apollo, etc., were all born on the 25th of December. Christmas comes just at the time of the winter solstice; the days then are shortest, and Darkness is more upon the face of the earth than ever. All the sun-gods were believed to be annually born at that epoch; for from this time its Light dispels more and more darkness with each succeeding day, and the power of the Sun begins to increase. However it may be, the Christmas festivities that were held by the Christians for nearly fifteen centuries, were of a particularly pagan character. Nay, we are afraid that even the present ceremonies of the Church can hardly escape the reproach of being almost literally copied from the mysteries of Egypt and Greece, held in honour of Osiris and Horus, Apollo and Bacchus. Both Isis and Ceres were called “Holy Virgins,” and a DIVINE BABE may be found in every –––––––––– * [Vol. I, p. 313.] † [This passage is from Godfrey Higgins’ Anacalypsis, Vol. I, p. 314, where he ascribes these words to Albertus Magnus and gives as reference “Lib. de Univers.”— Compiler .] –———— CHRISTMAS THEN AND CHRISTMAS NOW  165 “heathen” religion. We will now draw two pictures of the Merry Christmas; one portraying the “good old times,” and the other the present state of Christian worship. From the first days of its establishment as Christmas, the day was regarded in the double light of a holy commemoration and a most cheerful festivity: it was equally given up to devotion and insane merriment. “Among the revels of the Christmas season were the so-called feasts of fools and of asses, grotesque saturnalia, which were termed ‘December liberties,’ in which everything serious was burlesqued, the order of society reversed, and its decencies ridiculed”—says one compiler of old chronicles. “During the Middle Ages, it was celebrated by the gay fantastic spectacle of dramatic mysteries, performed by personages in grotesque masks and singular costumes. The show usually represented an infant in a cradle, surrounded by the Virgin Mary and St. Joseph, by bulls’ heads, cherubs, Eastern Magi (the Mobeds of old), and manifold ornaments.” The custom of singing canticles at Christmas, called Carols, was to recall the songs of the shepherds at the Nativity. “The bishops and the clergy often joined with the populace in carolling, and the songs were enlivened by dances, and by the music of tambours, guitars, violins and organs. . . .” We may add that down to the present times, during the days preceding Christmas, such mysteries are being enacted, with marionettes and dolls, in Southern Russia, Poland, and Galicia; and known as the Koliadovki . In Italy Calabrian minstrels descend from their mountains to Naples"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"and Rome, and crowd the shrines of the Virgin-Mother, cheering her with their wild music. In England, the revels used to begin on Christmas Eve, and continue often till Candlemas (Feb. 2) every day being a holiday till Twelfth-night (Jan. 6). In the houses of great nobles a “lord of misrule,” or “abbot of unreason” was appointed, whose duty it was to play the part of a buffoon. “The larder was filled with capons, hens, turkeys, geese, ducks, beef, mutton, pork, pies, puddings, nuts, plums, sugar and honey.” . . . “A glowing fire, made of great logs, the principal of which was termed the ‘Yule log,’ or Christmas 166  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS block, which might be burnt till Candlemas eve, kept out the cold; and the abundance was shared by the lord’s tenants amid music, conjuring, riddles, hot-cockles, fool-plough, snapdragon, jokes, laughter, repartee, forfeits and dances.” In our modern times, the bishops and the clergy join no more with the populace in open carolling and dancing; and feasts of “fools and asses” are enacted more in sacred privacy than under the eyes of the dangerous, argus-eyed reporter. Yet the eating and drinking festivities are preserved throughout the Christian world; and, more sudden deaths are doubtless caused by gluttony and intemperance during the Christmas and Easter holidays, than at any other time of the year. Yet, Christian worship becomes every year more and more a false pretence. The heartlessness of this lip-service has been denounced innumerable times, but never, we think, with a more affecting touch of realism than in a charming dream-tale, which appeared in the New York Herald about last Christmas. An aged man, presiding at a public meeting, said he would avail himself of the opportunity to relate a vision he had witnessed on the previous night. . . . He thought he was standing in the pulpit of the most gorgeous and magnificent cathedral he had ever seen. Before him was the priest or pastor of the church, and beside him stood an angel with a tablet and pencil in hand, whose mission it was to make record of every act of worship or prayer that transpired in his presence and ascended as an acceptable offering to the throne of God. Every pew was filled with richly-attired worshippers of either sex. The most sublime music that ever fell on his enraptured ear filled the air with melody. All the beautiful ritualistic Church services, including a surpassingly eloquent sermon from the gifted minister, had in turn transpired, and yet the recording angel made no entry in his tablet! The congregation were at length dismissed by the pastor with a lengthy and beautifully-worded prayer, followed by a benediction, and yet the angel made no sign! . . . Attended still by the angel, the speaker left the door of the church in rear of the richly-attired congregation. A poor, tattered castaway stood in the gutter beside the curbstone, with her pale, famished hand extended, silently pleading for alms. As the richly-attired worshippers from the church passed by, they shrank from the CHRISTMAS THEN AND CHRISTMAS NOW  167 poor Magdalen, the ladies withdrawing aside their silken, jewel-bedecked robes, lest they should be polluted by her touch. . . . Just then an intoxicated sailor came reeling down the side-walk on the other side. When he got opposite the poor forsaken girl, he staggered across the street to where she stood, and, taking a few pennies from his pocket, he thrust them into her hand, accompanied with the adjuration, “Here, your poor forsaken cuss, take this!” A celestial radiance now lighted up the face of the recording angel, who instantly entered the sailor’s act of sympathy and charity in his tablet, and departed with it as a sweat sacrifice to God. A concretion, one might say, of the Biblical story of the judgment upon the woman taken in adultery. Be it so; yet it portrays with a master hand the state of our Christian society.

There is also a tradition of the church, preserved to us by Olaus, archbishop of Upsala, that, at the festival of Christmas, “the men living in the cold Northern parts, are suddenly and strangely metamorphosed into wolves; and that a huge multitude of them meet together at an appointed place and rage so fiercely against mankind, that it suffers more from their attacks than ever they do from the natural wolves.”* Metaphorically viewed, this would seem to be more than ever the case with men, and particularly with Christian nations, now. There seems no need to wait for Christmas Eve to see whole nations changed into “wild beasts”—especially in time of war. –––––––––– * [Olaus Magnus, A Compendious History of the Goths, Swedes and Vandals, and other Northern Nations .

But we know that, from the very first, its roots struck so deeply, so entwined about human instincts, that the belief has endured through all generations, and is embedded in the consciousness of every nation and tribe, civilized, semi-civilized or savage. The greatest minds have speculated upon it; and the rudest savages, though having no name for the Deity, have yet believed in the existence of spirits and worshipped them. If, in Christian Russia, Wallachia, Bulgaria and Greece, the Oriental Church enjoins that upon All-Saints day offerings of rice and drink shall be placed upon the graves; and in “heathen” India, the same propitiatory gifts of rice are made to the departed; so, likewise, the poor savage of New Caledonia makes his sacrifice of food to the skulls of his beloved dead. According to Herbert Spencer, the worship of souls and relics is to be attributed to “the primitive idea that any property characterizing an aggregate, inheres in all parts of it. . . . The soul, present in the body of the dead man preserved entire, is also present in the preserved parts of his body. Hence, the faith in relics.” This definition, though in logic equally applicable to the gold-enshrined and bejewelled relic of the cultured Roman Catholic devotee, and to the dusty, timeworn skull of the fetish-worshipper, might yet be excepted to by the former, since he would say that he does not believe the soul to be present in either the THE POPULAR IDEA OF SOUL-SURVIVAL  169 whole cadaver, skeleton, or part, nor does he, strictly speaking, worship it. He but honours the reli c as something which, having belonged to one whom he deems saintly, has by the contact acquired a sort of miraculous virtue. Mr. Spencer’s definition, therefore, does not seem to cover the whole ground. So also Professor Max Müller, in his Introduction to the Science of Religion , after having shown to us, by citing numerous instances, that the human mind had, from the beginning, a “vague hope of a future life,” explains no more than Herbert Spencer whence or how came originally such a hope; but merely points to an inherent faculty in uncultivated nations of changing the forces of nature into gods and demons. He closes his lecture upon the Turanian legends and the universality of this belief in ghosts and spirits, by simply remarking that “the worship of the spirits of the departed is perhaps the most widely spread form of natural superstition all over the world.” [p. 211.] Thus, whichever way we turn for a philosophical solution of the mystery; whether we expect an answer from the o logy which is itself bound to believe in miracles, and teach supernaturalism; or ask it from the now dominant schools of modern thought—the greatest opponents of the miraculous in nature; or, again, turn for an explanation to that philosophy of extreme positivism which, from the days of Epicurus down to the modern school of James Mill, adopting for its device the glaring sciolism “ nihil in intellectu, quod non ante fuerit in sensu, ” makes intellect subservient to matter—we receive a satisfactory reply from none!"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"If this article were intended merely for a simple collation of facts, authenticated by travellers on the spot, and concerning but “superstitions” born in the mind of the primitive man, and now lingering only among the savage tribes of humanity, then the combined works of such philosophers as Herbert Spencer might solve our difficulties. We might remain content with his explanation that in the absence of hypothesis “foreign to thought in its earliest stage . . . primitive ideas, arising out of various experiences, derived from the inorganic world”—such as the actions of wind, 170  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS the echo, and man’s own shadow—proving to the uneducated mind that there was “an invisible form of existence which manifests power,” were all sufficient to have created a like “inevitable belief” (see Spencer’s “Genesis of Superstition,” Popular Science Monthly, March, 1875). But we are now concerned with something nearer to us, and higher than the primitive man of the Stone Age; the man who totally ignored “those conceptions of physical causation which have arisen only as experiences, and have been slowly organized during civilization.” We are now dealing with the beliefs of twenty millions of modern Spiritualists; our own fellow men, living in the full blaze of the enlightened 19th century. These men ignore none of the discoveries of modern science; nay, many among them are themselves ranked high among the highest of such scientific discoverers. Notwithstanding all this, are they any the less addicted to the same “form of superstition,” if superstition it be, than the primitive man? At least their interpretations of the physical phenomena, whenever accompanied by those coincidences which carry to their minds the conviction of an intelligence behind the physical Force—are often precisely the same as those which presented themselves to the apprehension of the man of the early and undeveloped ages. What is a shadow? asks Herbert Spencer. By a child and a savage “a shadow is thought of as an entity.” Bastian says of the Benin negroes, that “they regard men’s shadows as their souls” . . . thinking “that they . . . watch all their actions, and bear witness against them.”* According to Crantz, among the Greenlanders a man’s shadow “is one of his two souls—the one which goes away from his body at night.” By the Fijians, the shadow is called “the dark spirit, as distinguished from another which each man possesses.” And the celebrated author of the Principles of Psychology explains that “the community of meaning, hereafter to be noted more fully, which various unallied –––––––––– * [Dr. Adolf Bastian, Zur Mythologie und Psychologie der Nigritier in Guinea , etc., Berlin, 1894, p. 41.— Compiler .] ————— THE POPULAR IDEA O F SOUL-SURVIVAL  171 languag e s betray between shade and spirit, show us the same thing.* What all this shows us the most clearly however, is that, wrong and contradicting as the conclusions may be, yet the premises on which they are based are no fictions. A thing must be, before the human mind can think or conceive of it. The very capacity to imagine the existence of something usually invisible and intangible, is itself evidence that it must have manifested itself at some time. Sketching in his usual artistic way the gradual development of the soul-idea, and pointing out at the same time how “ mythology not only pervades the sphere of religion . . . but . . . infects more or less the whole realm of thought,” Professor Müller in his turn tells us that, when man wished for the first time to express . . . a distinction between the body and something else within him distinct from the body, an easy name that suggested itself was breath . . . chosen to express at first the principle of life, as distinguished from the decaying body, afterwards the incorporeal . . . immortal part of man—his soul, his mind, his Self . . . When a"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"person dies, we too say that he has given up the ghost, and ghost, too, meant originally spirit, and spirit meant breath. [pp. 359-61.] As instances of this, narratives by various missionaries and travellers are quoted. Questioned by Father F. de Bobadilla, soon after the Spanish conquest, as to their ideas concerning death, the Indians of Nicaragua told him that “when men die, there comes forth from their mouth something which resembles a person, and is called julio (Aztec yuli— ‘to live’) explains M. Müller. “This being is like a person, but does not die and the corpse remains here. . . .” In one of his numerous works, Andrew Jackson Davis, whom considered the greatest American clairvoyant and known as the “Poughkeepsie Seer,” gives us what is a perfect illustration of the belief of the Nicaragua Indians. This book ( Death and the After-Life ) contains an engraved frontispiece, representing the death-bed of an old woman. It is called the “Formation of the Spiritual Body.” Out of –––––––––– * [ The Principles of Sociology , London, 1876, pp. 129, 131.] ————– 172  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS the head of the defunct, there issues a luminous appearance—her own rejuvenated form.* Among some Hindus the spirit is supposed to remain for ten days seated on the eaves of the house where it parted from the body. That it may bathe and drink, two plantain leaf-cups are placed on the eaves, one full of milk and the other of water. “On the first day the dead is supposed to get his head; on the second day his ears, eyes, and nose; on the third, his hands, breast, and neck; on the fourth, his middle parts; on the fifth, his legs and feet; on the sixth, his vitals; on the seventh, his bones, marrow, veins, and arteries; on the eighth, his nails, hair, and teeth; on the ninth, all the remaining limbs, organs, and manly strength; and, on the tenth, hunger and thirst for the renewed body.” (“The Pâthâri Prabhus,” by Krishnanâth Raghunathji; in the Government Bombay Gazetteer, 1879.) Mr. Davis’ theory is accepted by all the Spiritualists, and it is on this model that the clairvoyants now describe the separation of the “incorruptible from the corruptible.” But here, Spiritualists and the Aztecs branch off into two paths; for, while the former maintain that the soul is in every case immortal and preserves its individuality through- –––––––––– * “Suppose a person is dying,” says the Poughkeepsie Seer, “the clairvoyant sees right over the head what may be called a magnetic halo—an ethereal emanation, in appearance golden, and throbbing as though conscious. . . .

Beneath it, is connected the brain . . . owing to the brain’s momentum. I have seen a dying person, even at the last feeble pulse-beat, rouse impulsively and rise up in bed to converse, but the next instant he was gone—his brain being the last to yield up the life-principles. The golden emanation . . . is connected with the brain by a very fine life-thread. When it ascends, there appears something white and shining like a human head; next, a faint outline of the face divine ; then the fair neck and beautiful shoulders; then, in rapid succession come all parts of the new body, down to the feet—bright shining image, a little smaller than the physical body, but a perfect prototype . . . in all except its disfigurements. The fine life-thread continues attached to the old brain. The next thing is the withdrawal of the electric principle.

The Lapponians and Finns also maintain that while the body decays, a new one is given to the dead, which the Shaman can alone see. . . . Though breath, or spirit, or ghost [says further on Professor Müller] are the most common names . . . we speak . . . of the shades of the departed, which meant originally their shadows. Those who first introduced this expression—and we find it in the most distant parts of the world—evidently took the shadow as the nearest approach to what they wished to express; something that should be incorporeal, yet closely connected with the body. The Greek , too, is not much more than the Little Ones, the Small Folk. But the curio us part . . . is this . . . that people who speak of the life or soul as the shadow of the body, have brought themselves to believe that a dead body casts no shadow, because the shadow has departed from it; that it becomes, in fact, a kind of Peter Schlemihl.† Do the Amazulu and other tribes of South Africa only thus believe? By no means; it is a popular idea among Slavonian Christians. A corpse which is noticed to cast a shadow in the sun is deemed a sinful soul rejected by heaven itself. It is doomed henceforth to expiate its sins as an earth-bound spirit, till the Day of the Resurrection. Both Lander and Catlin describe the savage Mandans as placing the skulls of their dead in a circle. “Each wife knows the skull of her former husband or child, ‘and there seldom passes a day that she does not visit it, with a dish of the best cooked food . . .

From a theosophical, magnetic—hence in a certain sense a scientific—standpoint, the former have, moreover, far better reasons to offer than the latter. The skull of the departed person, so interrogated, has surely closer magnetical affinities and relations to the defunct, than a table through the tippings of which the dead ones answer the living; a table, in most cases, which the spirit while embodied had never seen nor touched. But the Spiritualists are not the only ones to vie with the Mandans. In every part of Russia, whether mourning over the yet fresh corpse, or accompanying it to the burying ground, or during the six weeks following the death, the peasant women as well as those of the rich mercantile classes, go on the grave to shout, or in Biblican phraseology to “lift up their voices.” Once there, they wail in rhythm, addressing the defunct by name, asking of him questions, pausing as if for an answer. Not only the ancient and idolatrous Egyptians and Peruvians had the curious notion that the ghost or soul of the dead man was either present in the mummy, or that the corpse was itself conscious, but there is a similar belief now among the orthodox Christians of the Greek and the Roman churches. We reproach the Egyptians with placing their embalmed dead at the table; and the heathen Peruvians with having carried around the fields the dried-up corpse of a parent, that it might see and judge of the state of the crops. But what of the Christian Mexican of today, who under the guidance of his priest, dresses up his corpses in finery; bedecks them with flowers, and in case of the defunct happening to be a female—even paints its cheeks with"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"rouge.

On the other hand, in Russia, it is a universal custom to crown the deceased person’s brow with a long slip of gilt and ornamented paper, called Ventchik (the crown), upon which a prayer is printed in gaudy letters. This prayer is a kind of a letter of introduction with which the parish priest furnishes the corpse to his patron Saint, recommending the defunct to the Saint’s protection.* The Roman Catholic Basques write letters to their deceased friends and relatives, addressing them to either Paradise, Purgatory or—Hell, according to the instructions given by the Father confessor of the late addressees and, placing them in the coffins of the newly departed, ask the latter to safely deliver them in the other world, promising as a fee to the messenger, more or less masses for the repose of his soul.

Her sister, the Princess Christina, came also just after in much plainer costume, and with a timid school-girl air. Thus, we see that not only can the dead people deliver letters, but, even returning from their celestial homes, bring back with them their “lace and jewels.” As the ancient pagan Greek peopled his Olympian heaven with feasting and flirting deities; and the American Red Indian has his happy hunting-grounds where the spirits of brave chiefs bestride their ghostly steeds, and chase their phantom game; and the Hindu his many superior lokas, where their numerous gods live in golden palaces, surrounded with all manner of sensual delights; and the Christian his New Jerusalem with streets of “pure gold, as it were transparent glass,” and the foundations of the wall of the city –––––––––– * It runs in this wise: “St. Nicholas (or St. Mary so-and-so), holy patron of — (follow defunct’s full name and title), receive the soul of God’s servant, and intercede for remission of his (or her) sins.” ––––––––––– 176  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS “garnished . . . with precious stones”; where bodiless chirping cherubs and the elect, with golden ha rps, sing praises to Jehovah; so the modern Spiritualist has his “Summer Land Zone within the Milky Way,”* though somewhat higher than the celestial territories of other people.† There, amid cities and villages abounding in palaces, museums, villas, colleges and temples, an eternity is passed.

This daughter, who died at the age of three weeks, grew in some twenty-odd years in the Summer-Land, to be a fine young lady and now is wedded to the spirit son of Franklin Pierce, late President of the U.S. The wedding, witnessed by a famous clairvoyant of New York, was gorgeous. The “spirit bride” was “arrayed in a dress of mild green.” A wedding supper was spread by the spirit’s order, with lights and bouquets, and plates placed for the happy couple.

Among these, the spirits of the late Emperors, great philosophers, and sages, are revered the most. They are the public property of the whole nation, and are a part of the state religion, “while each family has its own manes which are treated with special reverence and honoured by many superstitious rites.”* But if all nations equally believe in, and many worship, their dead, their views as to the desirability of a direct intercourse with these late citizens differ widely. In fact, among the educated, only the modern Spiritualists seek to communicate constantly with them. We will take a few instances from the most widely separated peoples. The Hindus, as a rule, hold that no pure spirit of a man who died reconciled to his fate, will ever come back bodily to trouble mortals. They maintain that it is only the bhûtas— the souls of those who depart this life, unsatisfied and having their terrestrial desires unquenched, in short, bad, sinful men and women—who become “earth-bound.” Unable to ascend at once to Moksha, they have to linger upon earth until either their next transmigration or complete annihilation, and thus take every opportunity to obsess people, especially weak women. So undesirable is to them the return or apparition of such ghosts, that they use every means to prevent it. Even in the case of the most holy feeling—the mother’s love for her infant—they adopt measures to prevent her return to it. There is a belief among some of them that whenever a woman dies in childbirth, she will return to see and watch over her child. Therefore, on their way back from the ghât, after the burning of the body—the mourners thickly strew mustard seeds all along the road leading from the funeral pile to the defunct’s home. For some inconceivable reason they think that the ghost will feel obliged to pick up, on its way back, every one of these seeds. And, as the labour is slow and tedious, the poor mother can never reach her home before the cock crows, when she is obliged—in accordance with the ghostly laws— –––––––––– * [Quoted by M.

Among the Tchuvashes, a tribe inhabiting Russian domains, a son, whenever offering sacrifice to the spirit of his father, uses the following exorcism: “We honour thee with a feast; look, here is bread for thee, and different kinds of meat; thou hast all thou canst desire: but do not trouble us, do not come back near us.”* Among the Lapps and Finns, those departed spirits which make their presence visible and tangible, are supposed to be very mischievous and “the most mischievous are the spirits of the priests.” Everything is done to keep them away from the living. The agreement we find between this blind popular instinct and the wise conclusions of some of the greatest philosophers, and even modern specialists, is very remarkable. “Respect the spirits and—keep them at a distance”—said Confucius, six centuries B.C. Nine centuries later, Porphyry, the famous anti-theurgist, writing upon the nature of various spirits, expressed his opinion upon the spirits of the departed by saying that he knew of no evil which these pestilent demons would not be ready to do. And, in our own century, a kabalist, the greatest magnetizer living, Baron Du Potet, in his La Magie Dévoilée, warns the spiritists not to trouble the rest of the dead. For “the evoked shadow can fasten itself upon, follow, and for ever afterwards influence you; and we can appease it but through a pact which will bind us to it—till death!” But all this is a matter of individual opinion; what we are concerned with now is merely to learn how the basic fact of belief in soul-survival could have so engrafted itself upon every succeeding age—despite the extravagances woven into it—if it be but a shadowy and unreal intellectual conception originating with “primitive man.” Of all modern men of science, although he does his best in the body of the work to present the belief alluded to as a mere “superstition”—the only satisfactory answer is given by Prof. Max Müller, in his Introduction to the Science of Religion .

He can only do it, however, by overstepping the boundaries of comparative philology, and boldly invading the domain of pure metaphysics; by following, in short, a path forbidden by exact science. At one blow he cuts the Gordian knot which Herbert Spencer and his school have tied under the chariot of the “Unknowable.” He shows us that: “there is a philosophical discipline which examines into the conditions of sensuous or intuitional knowledge,” and “another philosophical discipline which examines into the conditions of rational or conceptual knowledge”; and then defines for us a third faculty. . . . . . the faculty of apprehending the Infinite, not only in religion but in all things; a power independent of sense and reason, a power in a certain sense contradicted by sense and reason, but yet a very real power, which has held its own from the beginning of the world, neither sense nor reason being able to overcome it, while it alone is able to overcome both reason and sense.”* The faculty of Intuition— that which lies entirely beyond the scope of our modern biologists—could hardly be better defined. And yet, when closing his lecture upon the superstitious rites of the Chinese, and their temples devoted to the worship of the departed ancestors, our great philologist remarks: “All this takes place by slow degrees; it begins with placing a flower on the tomb; it ends with worshipping the spirits . . .”† –––––––––– –––––––––– * [Müller, op . cit ., p. 18.] † [ Op . cit ., p. 214] ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME II 1879 180  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS “LIEUTENANT-COLONEL ST.

The biologists could and would not remain silent witnesses of this memorable crisis. Clad from head to foot in the panoply of exact sciences; hardened in battles against ignorance, superstition and falsehood, they rushed to their places in the ranks of the fighters and, as those having authority, began the work of demolition. But who destroys ought to rebuild; and exact science does nothing of the kind, at least so far as the question of the highest psychological aspirations of humanity is concerned. Strange to say, yet nevertheless an incontrovertible fact, the duty has fallen upon the daily augmenting body of Spiritualists, to sweep away the mangled débris of the warfare, and rebuild from the ruins of the past something more tangible, more unassailable than the dreamy doctrines of theology. From the first, Spiritualism has fortified its positions by ocular demonstrations, slowly but surely replacing fanciful hypothesis and blind faith with a series of phenomena which, when genuine, invite the crucial tests of the most exacting experimentalists. It is one of the most curious features of the day, to see science in her double rôle of the aggressor and [the] attacked. And it is a sight, indeed, to follow the steady advance of the columns of “infidelity” against the strongholds of the Church, simultaneously with the pushing back of materialism towards its last entrenchments by the Spiritualists. Both the fundamental doctrines of theology, and the cold negations of science, have of late been successfully assailed by learned and skillful writers. And, it can hardly be denied, that there are strong indications of wavering A N O LD B OOK AND A N EW O NE  183 on the p a rt of both the attacked parties, with an evident disposition to capitulate. The Speaker ’ s C ommentary , followed by the new edition of the revised Bible, giving up as it despairingly does, the hitherto treasured Mosaic miracles, and the recent additions to the party of the Spiritualists of more than one great man of science, are impressive facts. Canon Farrar, of Westminster Abbey, destroys the old-fashioned belief in the eternity of hell, and the veteran and learned philosopher, Dr. Fichte of Germany, dying, all but confesses his belief in the philosophy of Spiritualism! Alas, for the Philistines of Biology; this Goliath whom they but put forth as their champion was slain by a single medium, and"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"the spear which seemed as big and strong “as a weaver’s beam,” has pierced their own sides! The most recent development of this double conflict is a work which comes just at a time to palliate the evil effects of another one which preceded it. We refer to The Mechanism of Man , by Mr. Serjeant Cox, the Anthropogenie of Professor Haeckel. The latter had sown wind and reaped the whirlwind; and a furious hurricane it was at one time. The public had begun to look up to the Jena professor as to a new saviour from the “dark superstitions” of the forefathers. Reaction had come. Between the dying infallibility of the Churches, the not over-satisfactory results of Spiritualism, and, for the average masses, far too deep and philosophical researches of Herbert Spencer, Bain, and the great lights of exact Science, the public was hesitating and perplexed. On the one hand, it had a strong, and ever growing desire to follow a progress that went hand in hand with science; but, notwithstanding its late conquests, science finds missing links at every step, dreary blanks in its knowledge, “chasms” on whose brinks its votaries shudder, fearing to cross. On the other hand, the absurdly unjust ridicule cast upon the believers in phenomena, held back the general public from personal investigation. True, the Church or rather the “schoolmen’s philosophy,” miscalled Christianity, as Huxley has it, was daily offering to compromise, and with but a slight effort of diplomacy one might remain 184  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS within t he fold, while disbelieving even in a personal devil, without risking to “smell of the fagg o tt.” But the spell was broken and the prestige quite gone. For faith there is no middle ground. It must be either completely blind, or it will see too much. Like water, it ceases to be pure as soon as the smallest foreign ingredient is introduced. The public is a big child; cunning yet trusting, diffident and yet credulous. Is it cause for wonder then, that while it hesitated between the conflicting parties, a man like Haeckel, vain and presumptuous, notwithstanding his great learning, ever ready to dogmatize upon problems for the solution of which humanity has thirsted for ages, and which no true philosophical mind will dare presume to answer conclusively—secured at one time the greatest attention for his Anthropogeny ? Between men like Balfour Stewart, Du Bois-Reymond, and other honest scientists, who confess their ignorance, and one who proclaims that he has solved every riddle of life, and that nature has disclosed to him her last mystery, the public will rarely hesitate. As one of Haeckel’s critics remarks, a street quack, with his panacea medicine, will often secure a far more liberal and numerous audience than an honest and cautious physician. Anthropogeny has plunged more minds into a profound materialism than any other book of which we have knowledge. Even the great Huxley was at one time inclined (see “Darwin and Haeckel,” Popular Science Monthly for March, 1875), more than was needed, to support Haeckel’s views, and laud his book, which he called “a milestone indicating the progress of the theory of evolution,” a “real life book, full of power and genius, and based upon a foundation of practical, original"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"work, to which few living men can offer a parallel.” Whether the father of Protoplasm continues to think so to this day, is a matter of little consequence, though we doubt it. The public, at least, was speedily disabused by the combined efforts of the greatest minds of Europe. In this famous work of Haeckel’s, not only is man refused a soul, but an ancestor is forced upon him, in the A N O LD B OOK AND A N EW O NE  185 shape o f a formless, gelatinous Bathybius Haeckelii— the prot o plasmic root of man—which dwelt in the slime at the bottom of the seas “before the oldest of the fossiliferous rocks were deposited.” Having transformed himself, in good time, into a series of interesting animals—some consisting of but one bowel, and others of a single nose ( Monorhinae ) , all evolved out of Professor Haeckel’s fathomless ingenuity, our genealogical line is led up to, and stops abruptly at the soulless man! We have nothing whatever against the physical side of the theory of evolution, the general theory of which we thoroughly accept ourselves; neither against Haeckel’s worms, fishes, mammals, nor, finally, the tailless anthropoid —all of which he introduces to fill up the hiatus between ape and man—as our forefathers. No more do we object to his inventing names for them and coupling them with his own. What we object to is the utter unconcern of the Jena professor as to the other side of the theory of evolution: to the evolution of spirit, silently developing and asserting itself more and more with every newly perfected form. What we again object to is that the ingenious evolutionist not only purposely neglects, but in several places actually sneers at the idea of a spiritual evolution, progressing hand in hand with the physical, though he might have done it as scientifically as he did the rest and—more honestly. He would thereby have missed, perhaps, the untimely praises of the protoplasmic Huxley, but won for his Anthropogeny the thanks of the public. Per se , the theory of evolution is not new, for every cosmogony—even the Jewish Genesis, for him who understands it—has it. And Manu who places special creation with periodical revolutions or Pralayas, followed, many thousands of years ago, the chain of transformation from the lowest animal to the highest—man, even more comprehensively if less scientifically (in the modern sense of the word) than Haeckel. Had the latter held more to the spirit of the modern discoveries of biology and physiology than to their dead-letter and his own theories, he would have led, perhaps, a new hegira of 186  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS scienc e separating itself violently from the cold materialism of the age. No one—not even"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"the staunchest apostle of Positivism—will deny that the more we study the organisms of the animal world, and assure ourselves that the organ of all psychical manifestation is the nervous system, the more we find the necessity of plunging deeper into the metaphysical world of psychology, beyond the boundary line hitherto marked for us by the materialists. The line of demarcation between the two modes of life of the vegetable and animal worlds is yet terra incognita for every naturalist. And no more will anyone protest against the scientifically established truism that intelligence manifests itself in direct proportion with the cerebral development, in the consecutive series of the animal world. Following then, the development of this system alone—from the automatic motions produced by the simple process of what is called the reflex action of the ascidian mollusk, for instance, the instinctive motions of the bee, up to the highest order of mammalians and ending, finally, with man—if we invariably find an unbroken ratio of steady increase in cerebral development, hence—a corresponding increase of reasoning powers, of intelligence—the deduction becomes irresistible that there must be a spiritual as well as a physical evolution. This is the A.B.C. of physiology. And are we to be told that there is no further development, no future evolution for man? That there is a prospect on earth for the caterpillar to become a butterfly, for the tadpole to develop into a higher form, and for every bird to live after it has rid itself of its shell, while for man, who has evoluted from the lowest to the highest point of physical and mental development on this earth, all further conscious, sentient development is to be arrested by the dissolution of his material organization? That, just as he has reached the culminating point, and the world of soul begins unfolding before his mind; just as the assurance of another and a better life begins dawning upon him; his memory, reason, feeling, consciousness, intelligence, and all his highest aspirations are to desert him in one brief moment, and go out into eternal darkness? Were it so, knowledge, science, life, and all nature A N O LD B OOK AND A N EW O NE  187 itself , w ould be the most idiotic of farces? If we are told that such a research does not pertain t o the province of positive sciences, that no exact and accurate deductions are to be made out of purely metaphysical premises, then we will inquire, why should then deductions, as hypothetical deductions, from purely imaginary data, as in the case of Haeckel’s Bathybius and tailless anthropoid, be accepted as scientific truths, as no such missing link has ever yet been found, any more than it has been proved that the invertebrated moner, the grandparent of the lovely amphioxus, or that philosophical recluse—the Bathybius, ever existed? But now, peace to the ashes of our direct ancestor! The venerable Professor Virchow, backed by an army of infuriated naturalists, passing like the powerful khamsin, the wind of the desert, over the plains of hypothetical speculations, destroyed all our best hopes for a closer acquaintance with our noble relatives of the slimy ooze. Beginning with Bathybius, whom he dragged out of his sea-mud—to show he was not there—the Berlin savant"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"evinced no more respect for the Simiae Catarrhinae (our tail-blessed ancestor) whom he hurled back into non-being. He went further and crushed out of existence even the beautiful tailless ape—the missing link! So strong was the reaction of thought as to the merits of Haeckel’s work, that it well-nigh knocked off his legs even the innocent though first cause of Anthropogeny— the great Charles Darwin, himself. But the mischief is done, and it requires mighty powerful restoratives to bring the ex-admirers of Haeckel back to a belief in the human soul. Serjeant Cox’s The Mechanism of Man : An answer to the Question : What Am I ? now in its third edition, will remain as one of the most powerful answers to the soul-destroying sophistry of Heackel and his like. It is quite refreshing to find that a work upon such an unwelcome subject—to the men of science—a book which treats of psychology and its phenomena, is so eagerly welcomed by the educated public. In reviewing it, a London weekly very truly remarks that: . . . The Scientists have had a capital time of it lately; they have been able to raise a cloud of doubts about the most ser io us questions 188  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS of life; but they have not been able to solve one of the difficulties they raised . Into the arena which they occupied few men dared to enter and withstand them, so that the boastful cry the Scientists raised has gone echoing far and wide, that the old foundations of belief in Immortality were myths, fit for weak-minded people. In Serjeant Cox, however, the timid believers have found [a] champion able to fight the Scientists with their own weapons; able to pursue the theories raised by them to their ultimate conclusions; able to unmask the pretentious arrogance of men who would destroy simply because they cannot appreciate; men who would pull down, but cannot build up anything to take the place of the wrecked structure. But we will now let the author speak for himself: . . . The Scientists began by denial of the facts and phenomena, not by disproof of them; by argument a priori that th ey cannot be and therefore are not. That failing, the next step was to discredit the witnesses. They were not honest; if honest, they were not competent; if competent by general intelligence and experience, in the particular instances they were the victims of illusion or delusion. That is the present position of the controversy. The assertion is still repeated here, with entire confidence, that the Mechanism of Man is directed and determined by some intelligent force within itself; that the existence of that force is proved by the facts and phenomena attendant upon the motions of that mechanism in its normal and its abnormal conditions; that this force is by the same evidence proved to be the product of something other than the molecular mechanism of the body; that this something is an entity distinct from that molecular structure, capable of action beyond and apart from it; that this Something is what is called S OUL , and that this soul lives after it h a s parted from the body. This subject, that man has a soul — which so many men of science, especially physicians and psychologists deny—is treated in the work under notice with the utmost ability. Numberless new avenues—as the result of such a knowledge when proved—are opened to us by this able pioneer; and under his skillful treatment that hope which was blighted for the moment by the brutal hand of Positivism, is rekindled in the reader’s breast, and death is made to lose its terrors. So confident is the author that upon the solution of this enigma—which is one but to those who will not see—depend the most"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"important questions to humanity, such as disease, old age, chronic and nervous sufferings, many of which are now considered as beyond human help, that he thinks that a perfect acquaintance with psychology will be A N O LD B OOK AND A N EW O NE  189 of the u t most help in treating even the most obstinate diseases. He pointedly reminds his readers t hat: . . . It seems scarcely credible, but it is literally true that the most learned physician cannot tell us by what process any one medicine he administers performs its cures! He can say only that experience has shown certain effects as often found to follow the exhibition of certain drugs. But he certainly does not know how those drugs produce those effects. It is strange and distressing to observe what irrational prejudices still prevail in all matters connected with the physiology of body and mind, and their mutual relationship and influences, even among persons otherwise well informed and who deem themselves educated. It is still more strange that not the least prejudiced nor the least instructed in these subjects are to be found in the profession whose business it is to keep the human machine in sound working condition. Serjeant Cox need scarcely hope to count the practising physicians among his admirers. His last r emark is more applicable to Chinese medicine, whose practitioners are paid by their patients only so long as they preserve their health, and have their pay stopped at the first symptoms of disease in their patrons—than in Europe. It seems rather the “business” of the European doctor to keep the human machine in an unsound condition. Human suffering is for European physicians, as the torments of purgatory for the priest—a perennial source of income. But the author suggests that “the cause of this ignorance of the laws of life, of Mental Physiology and of Psychology” is that “they are not studied as we study the structure which that Life moves and that Intelligence directs.” He asks whether it has . . . never occurred to the Physician and the Mental Philosopher that possibly in the laws of life, in the physiolog y of mind, in the relationship of the conscious Self and the body, more even than in the structure itself, are to be found the causes of many of the maladies to which that structure is subject. Therefore, that in the investigation of these laws, the secret is to be sought of the operation of remedies, rather than in the molecular structure where for centuries the Doctors have been exclusively hunting for them with so little success? Dr. Wm. A. Hammond, of New York, the famous professor of diseases of the mind and nerv o us system, experimented for years with the celebrated “Perkins’ tractors,” 190  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS metal discs, whose fame at one time nearly came to grief, through the cunning fraud of an English s p eculator. This man, who was making a specialty of the metallic treatment, was detected in imitating the expensive gold, silver, copper, and nickel rings, with rings of"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"wood painted or gilded. But the results were not changed; patients were cured! Now this is a clear case of psychological and mesmeric power. And Dr. Hammond himself calls it “ nothing more than the power of one mind over another .” This noted materialist is thoroughly convinced that if one person suggests an idea to another who has complete faith in that person’s power, the one acted upon will experience all the sensations the operator may suggest to him. He has made a number of experiments and even published presumably learned papers upon the subject. And yet Mesmerism, Spiritualism, and occult psychological phenomena in general, upon the investigation of which Serjeant Cox lays the greatest stress, have no bitterer enemy or more active opponent than the New York celebrity. We need only recall his dogmatic attitude in the case of Miss Mollie Fancher, of Brooklyn, a respectable young girl, who, according to the statement of Dr. Charles E. West, has lived without any food for over nine years. This extraordinary girl never sleeps—her frequent trances being the only rest she obtains; she reads sealed letters as though they were open; describes distant friends; though completely blind, perfectly discriminates colours; and finally, though her right hand is rigidly drawn up behind her head, by a permanent paralysis, makes embroidery upon canvas, and produces in wax, without having taken a lesson in the art, and with neither a knowledge of botany nor even models to copy, flowers of a most marvellously natural appearance. In the case of this phenomenal patient, there are numbers of thoroughly reliable and well educated witnesses to testify for the genuineness of the phenomena. The joint testimony of several respectable clergymen, of Professor West, of Mr. H. Parkhurst, the astronomer, and of such physicians as Drs. Speir, Ormiston, Kissam and Mitchell, is on record. With all this examined and proved, Dr. Hammond, A N O LD B OOK AND A N EW O NE  191 notwit h standing his personal experience of the “power of mind over matter,” had not a jot to give t h e reporter in explanation of the phenomenon, but the words “humbug!—a clear case of deception! . . . Simply the deception of a hysterical girl, Sir.”. . . “But has she deceived all these clergymen and physicians, and for years?” inquired the reporter. “Oh, that’s nothing. Clergymen are the most gullible men in the world, and physicians who have not made a study of nervous diseases are apt to be imposed upon by these girls.” . . . (The N . Y . Sun, of Nov. 25th, 1878). We doubt whether even Serjeant Cox’s able book, though he is President of the Psychological Society of Great Britain and ought to be a competent witness, will make any more impression upon such a mind as that of the physician Hammond than a ball of snow upon the rock. And since the multitude suffers itself to be led by such sciolists as he, this able book may have to wait another generation before receiving that need of appreciation which it merits. And yet, no author treating on psychology has ever built up with more scientific precision or force of argument his proofs of the existence of a soul in man, and its manifestation in the “mechanism of man.” He concludes the work with the following remarks:"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":". . . Scientists may sneer at Psychology as being visionary science, based upon mere assumption and dealing with that whose very existence is problematical. But its subject matter is as real as that with which they deal. Even were it not so, the more important it would be that the study of it should be pursued, with an honest endeavour to ascertain if the foundation on which it is erected be sound or baseless — that if, after due investigatio n , it be found to be false, the world may cease from a vain labour; but that, if it be proved a truth, Man may have the blessed assurance that, as a fact and not merely as a faith, he has a Soul and inherits an Immortality. We wish all such learned authors completest success in their noble efforts to bring back hum a nity to the Light of Truth—but we have but little hope for the nineteenth century.

Some time ago Dr. Stephenson was prospecting the vast hornblende and chloritic slate formation between Gainesville and Jefferson, and found a singular rock on the land of Mr. Frank Harrison, which he considers one of the most interesting and inexplicable productions of the laws of chemical affinity. The boulder of hornblende weighs nearly a ton, is black, and crystallized through it in seams about one-eighth of an inch thick of white quartz are the figures 1791. They are about four inches long and placed at equal distances from each other. It is common in all plutonic rock to see seams of quartz traverse the granite, gneiss, hornblende and other classes of rocks in various directions, from one-eighth of an inch to a foot or more, which sometimes cross each other, but never with the regularity and symmetry of this. It has not been one thousand years since the Arab invented our numerals, from 1 to 10, and we find here in perfect form the same figures, made by the laws of chemical affinity on the oldest rocks, which formed the crust of the earth countless millions of years before there was a vegetable or animal in existence. It may be a meaningless freak of nature, and it may be the freak of a sensational and not over s crupulous reporter: either is possible, and a great caution is certainly required, before we credit such an extraordinary piece of news. But what is a freak of nature? The effect of a natural cause; not even a “freak” can happen otherwise. And yet, when this cause is evident who ever presumes to go any deeper into its origination? Not the scientists; for these generally leave the prior causes to take care of themselves. Some H. P.

Some may see a connection between them and the French Revolution; others with the finger of God Himself, who traced them for some unfathomable reason, to seek to penetrate which would be a sacrilege. But now, times and men are changed. The strong-backed, convenient, maid-of-all-work called “Will of God” and “Providence,” upon which these amiable and unconscious blasphemers (regarded as very pious Christians) pile all the garbage and evils of imperfect nature—has a time of rest. The All-Perfect is no more held responsible for every calamity and inexplicable event, except by a few of the above-named pious souls. Least of all by the men of science. The Christian “Will of God” in company with the Mohammedan Kismet are handed over to the emotional Methodist and the irrepressible Mullah. Hence, the cause of the figures—if figures there are—comes within the category of scientific research. Only, in this case, the latter must be taken in its broadest sense, that which embraces within the area of natural sciences psychology, and even metaphysics. Consequently, if this story of the marvellous boulder should prove something more than a newspaper hoax, originating with an idle reporter, we will have, perhaps, some comments to offer. We may then, strengthen our arguments by giving a few sentences from a curious manuscript belonging to a Fellow of the Theosophical Society in Germany, a learned mystic, who tells us that the document is already on its way to India. It is a sort of diary, written in those mystical characters, half ciphers, half alphabet, adopted by the"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Rosicrucians during the previous two centuries, and the key to which, is now possessed by only a very few mystics. Its author is the famous and mysterious Count de Saint-Germain; he, who before and during the French Revolution puzzled and almost terrified every capital of Europe, and some crowned Heads; and of whom such a number of weird stories are told. All comment now would be premature. The bare suggestion of there being anything more mysterious than a 194  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS blind “f reak” of nature in this particular find, is calculated to raise a scornful laugh from every qu a rter, with the exception, perhaps, of some Spiritualists and their natural allies, the Theosophists. Our space is scant, so we will make room for another, and far more extraordinary story, endorsed by no less a personage than Marshal MacMahon, ex-President of the Republic of France, and credited—as in religious duty bound—by some hundred millions of Roman Catholics. We admit it the more willingly since, had any such story originated with either the Theosophists or the Spiritualists, it would have been straightway ridiculed and set down as a cock-and-bull fable. But circumstances alter cases—with the Catholics; none, however sceptical at heart, will dare laugh (above his breath) at a story of supernatural “miracles” worked by the Madonna and her Saints, or by Satan and his imps. For such “miracles” the Church holds a patent. The fact tacitly conceded, if not always secretly believed, by such a tremendous body of Christians, for anyone to discredit the power of the devil, even in this age of free thought, makes him ranked at once with the despised infidels . Only the Spiritualists and Theosophists have made themselves culpable in the eyes of the panegyrists of reason, and deserve to be called “lunatics” for believing in phenomena produced by natural causes. Even Protestants are warned against pooh-poohing the story we here quote; for they too are bound by their Calvanistic and other dogmas to believe in the power of Satan—a power accorded the Enemy of Man by the ever inscrutable—“Will of God.” [Follows the narrative from the Catholic Mir r or of Baltimore regarding a remarkable experience with a native sorcerer, which Marshal MacMahon had while in Algiers.] Unlike the Marshal, we have something to say. The Spiritualists would advance a very easy and w ell-known theory to “account” for it, and the Theosophists—though, perhaps, slightly modifying it, would follow suit. But then, they would have the great body of Roman Catholics against them. Their theory, or, shall we say, “infallible dogma”?— is, if the story be true, that the Arab corporal had sold his N OCTURNAL T HOUGHTS  195 soul to t he Father of Evil. But, though presumably all-powerful for mischief, old Nick"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"found his match in the leaden charm, or medal of the Virgin; and, gnashing his teeth, had to take to his heels before the presence of the image of the Queen of Heaven. Well, one theory is as good as any other when we come to hypotheses. But then,—the infidels might ask—why not give a slight extra stretch to that divine power, and rid humanity at once and for ever of that eternal mischief-maker, who, “as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour”? Weak is humanity and faltering the steps of man! Why not, at one clip, save it from the snares of the devil; the more so as humanity, if incapable of resisting such a power, is weak through no fault of its own, but again because it so pleased kind Providence? Surely, if a simple leaden amulet has such a virtue of putting to flight the devil, how much more ought the blessed Virgin herself do. Especially, since of late she has taken to visiting in person and so often the famous grotto at Lourdes. But then—dreadful thought!—how could the wicked be sentenced to eternal perdition? Whither could the sinner direct his trembling steps, when once that kingdom “where the worm dieth not, and the fire is never quenched” is annexed by the Romish Imperial Raj of Heaven? Impassable chasm, sharp horns of a dilemma! So long as it bears its name, Christianity cannot get rid of the devil, without, so to say, committing a most dreadful, unthinkable suicide. Some years ago the pious and holy Cardinal, Father Ventura di Raulica, expressed his opinion upon the subject. “To demonstrate,” he says, “the existence of Satan, is to reestablish one of the fundamental dogmas of the Church, which serve as a basis for Christianity, and without which it would be but a name. . . .” And, the very Catholic Chevalier Gougenot des Mousseaux adds,—Satan is “the Chief Pillar of Faith. . . . But for him, the Saviour, the Crucified, the Redeemer, would be but the most ridiculous of supernumeraries, and the Cross an insult to good sense” ( Moeurs et Pratiques des Démons , p. x). Thus we see that the next and most logical move of the 196  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS infalli ble Church would be to institute a yearly vote of thanks—a Te Deum —to the D evil. This happy thought is not copyrighted, and His Holiness is welcome to it. The more so, as it seems that again, for some inscrutable and providential reasons better known in heaven than comprehended upon earth, not only the Devil, but even simple mortals are allowed to do the deeds of darkness. In the following horrifying trick, played lately at the above-mentioned miracle-working grotto of Lourdes, we find the “Protectress” utterly incapable of protecting even herself. We copy this sad tale of human infamy also from our pious contemporary— The Catholic Mirror : . . . D ESECRATION AT L OURDES.—A very strange story comes to us from France—a story difficult to credit, b u t our authority is trustworthy. All who have been at the miraculous shrine at Lourdes must have been struck by the number of trophies that are the offerings of pious pilgrims, or that the quick recurring miracles have collected in the place. There is a touching appropriateness in the devotion that makes the grateful pilgrim offer at the shrine the mementoes of his disease which the mercy of heaven has rendered useless. All"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"the walls at Lourdes were hung with crutches, and wooden legs, and wooden arms , to which scrolls were attached with dates and names authenticating the miracles. These trophies, it appears, excited the malignity of the unbelievers. It was a hard thing to scoff at the miracles with such visible testimony of their truth before the eyes of the world. Therefore it was resolved that the testimony must be destroyed. In the dead of the night some miscreants penetrated to the shrine, the religious trophies were collected in a heap and set in flames. They were reduced to ashes. A beautiful rose tree that sprang from a cleft in the rocks was destroyed by the fire, and the face of the statue of the Virgin was scorched and blackened by the smoke. It would be difficult in all history to find a parallel for this dastardly and disgraceful outrage by these “apostles of reason and liberty.” The “apostles of reason and liberty” are criminals, and ought to be punished—as incendi a ries. But the majesty of the Law once vindicated, ought they not, as “apostles of reason” to be allowed to respectfully put a few questions to their judges? As, for instance: how is it that “our blessed Lady of Lourdes,” so prompt at producing “miracles” of the most astounding character, passively suffered such an appalling personal outrage? That was just the moment to show her power, confound the “infidels,” and vindicate her NOCTURN A L THOUGHTS  197 “miracles.” A better opportunity was never lost. As it is, the criminals scorch and blacken the face o f the statue and—get away unscorched, even by the fire of (the Catholic) heaven. Really, it was very indiscreet in our contemporary to publish this story! Perhaps these “apostles” were the disciples and followers of the Zouave Jacob, whose fame as a healer is not inferior to that of our Lady of Lourdes and the miraculous water.* Or, it may be, they had known J. R. Newton, the celebrated American mesmeric “healer,” whose large reception rooms are always hung, and no less than the walls of the grotto, with “trophies” of his mesmeric power, “with crutches, wooden legs, and wooden . . . arms” (?)—no! not with wooden arms, for this implies previous amputations of natural arms. And almost magical as are the healing powers of our respected friend Dr. Newton, we doubt whether he has ever claimed the gift of endowing human beings with the extraordinary peculiarity of a cray-fish— i . e ., of having a new arm to grow out of an amputated stump, as seems to have been the case at Lourdes according to the Catholic Mirror . But it is not alone the wondrous “grotto” that proved powerless before the destructive element. The lightning (of God?) showed itself no more a respecter of the house of God and holy shrines than those firebolts, the “apostles of reason and liberty.” The number of churches, camp meeting tents, tabernacles and altars destroyed, during these last two years, by hurricane and lightning, in Europe and America, is appalling. And now:— . . .

I contradicted the reporter in my article in October, because I never said I had myself helped in the operation done by the Tibetan shepherds, who live in the Himâlayas at 28,000 feet above sea level, nor have I done it myself. But, as, until this day, it was one of the secrets of our Adepts I did not think I had the right to speak about it more than was necessary. I have seen that operation done by our “Brothers” fifty times, on human beings. They have operated on me, and I once slept for eleven weeks, believing myself to be awake the whole time, and walking around like a ghost of Pontoise, without being able to understand why no one appeared to see me and to answer me. I was entirely unaware that I was liberated from my old carcass which, at that time, however, was a little younger. That was at the beginning of my studies. As far as the animals are concerned, science will learn LETTER O F MADAME BLAVATSKY  207 the secret—for human beings it will have to wait, materialistic as it is. It is the great secret known to f akirs, who bury themselves for months and revive after a certain time. During our latest journey, three months ago, we saw this phenomenon at Jeypoor (Râjputâna), the land of the “ Children of the Solar Race :” a fakir, or rather a Hindu yogi (for the fakirs are usually Mussulmans), put himself in a trance, and in the presence of a great crowd, including well educated, but as usual skeptical, persons, allowed himself to be immured in a chamber, and remained therein for twenty days; the officials of the Mahârâja’s Government opened the chamber and brought out the cadaver . At the end of a quarter of an hour the man came to himself and, greeting the public, went away. He accomplished this act of phenomenalism as a penitence. We have no systems, but we have facts and hundreds of them, well authenticated and which are based on a philosophy known for thousands of years, which explains all these facts scientifically, bringing proof to support what it teaches. It is not the English nor any other people who will ever lay their hands on the old manuscripts which explain these phenomena; neither the Brâhmanas nor the Buddhists, who have access to them, will hand them over to Max Müller and Co., but our Swâmi Dayânanda Saraswatî, first-class scholar, a man who knows his Sanskrit as no one else here, a Yogi who has spent seven years in the jungles (a brush forest, a dense virgin growth, deserts covered with tropical vegetation where live but ferocious beasts and Yogis who have no fear of them), who is deeply versed in the occult sciences and the secrets of the pagodas, a Brâhmana himself, would furnish us any manuscript, for we belong to the Society which is an integral part of the Ârya Samâj of Âryâvarta ; as he is the Supreme Chief of the Vedist Section (those who study and recognize the Vedas pure and simple) of the Theosophical Society, you must understand that we have facilities for natural access to those old treasures of the ancient Vedic literature of the Âryas such as no one else has.

And that thus, men—especially philosophers—seem to be born only to disagree. As far back as history can reach, gods were constantly created and worshipped by one part, while pulled down and desecrated by the other. And, though Satire is more cruel than Medusa and as blind as blindfolded Themis, yet it has never proved its self-sufficiency as an argument, any more than a blow from a stronger hand has proved its right to stand to reason.

The following is a footnote appended by H.P.B.] This incident is too important to pass by without editorial comment. The power of the Yogi to quit his own body and enter and animate that of another person, though affirmed by Patañjali and included among the Siddhis of Krishna, is discredited by Europeanized young Indians. Naturally enough, since, as Western biologists deny a soul to man, it is an unthinkable proposition to them that the Yogi’s soul should be able to enter another’s body. That such an unreasoning infidelity should prevail among the pupils of European schools, is quite reason enough why an effort should be made to revive in India those schools of Psychology in which the Aryan youth were theoretically and practically taught the occult laws of Man and Nature. We, who have at least some trifling acquaintance with modern science, do not hesitate to affirm our belief that this temporary transmigration of souls is possible. We may even go so far as to say that the phenomenon has been experimentally proven to us in New York, among other places. And, since we would be among the last to require so marvelous a statement to be accepted upon any one’s unsupported testimony, we urge our readers to first study Aryan literature, and then get from personal experience the corroborative evidence.

The press got hold of it at the time of its occurrence, and the annals of the literature of Italy preserve the record of it until now, though in many and various other forms. It was in 1831. The great, the “diabolical” Paganini was creating at the house of the Paris Opera an enthusiasm unsurpassed by any triumph he had previously gleaned. After hearing him, several of the leading musicians of the noblest orchestra in the Western world, broke their instruments . . . At that time, there lived at Paris another violinist gifted with an extraordinary talent, but poor and unknown, a German, whose name was Franz Stenio. He was young and a philosopher, imbued with all the mysticism of Hoffmann’s Chant d ’ Antonia , and nursed in the atmosphere of the old haunted castles on the Rhine. He had studied the occult arts and dabbled in alchemy, but otherwise was interested but little in the matters of this world. The whole of his aspirations mounted, incense-like, together with the wave of heavenly harmony which he drew forth from his four-stringed instrument, to a higher and a nobler sphere. His mother, his only love on earth and whom he had never left, died when he was thirty. It was then that he T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  221 f o u n d h e h ad been left poor indeed; poor in purse, still poorer in earthly affections. His old violin teacher, Samuel Klaus, one of those grotesque figures which look as if they had just stepped out of some old mediaeval panel, with the speaking and piercing voice of a “show Punch,” and the fantastic allures of a night goblin, then took him by the hand, and, leading him to his violin, simply said:—“Make yourself famous. I am old and childless, I will be your father, and we will live together.” And they went to Paris. Franz had never heard Paganini. He swore he would either eclipse all the violinists of those days, or break his instrument and at the same time put an end to his own life. Old Klaus rejoiced, and jumping on one leg like an old satyr, flattered and incensed him, believing himself all the while to be performing a sacred duty for the holy cause of art. Franz was making himself reads for his first appearance before the public, when Paganini’s arrival in the great capital of fashion was loudly heralded by his fame. The German violinist resolved to postpone his début , and at first smiled at the enthusiastic mentions of the Italian’s name. But soon this name became a fiery thorn in the heart of Franz, a threatening phantom in the mind of old Samuel. Both shuddered at the very mention of Paganini’s successes. At last the Italian’s first concert was announced, and the prices of admission made enormous. The master and the pupil both pawned their watches and got two modest seats. Who can describe the enthusiasm, the triumphs of this famous, and at the same time, fatal night? At the first touch of Paganini’s magic bow, both Franz and Samuel felt as if the icy hand of death had touched them. Carried away by an irresistible enthusiasm which turned into a violent, unearthly, mental torture, they dared neither look into each"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"other’s faces, nor exchange one word during the whole performance. At midnight, while the chosen delegates of the Musical Society of Paris, unhitching the horses, were dragging in triumph Paganini home in his carriage, the two Germans having returned to their obscure apartment, were sitting 222  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS mournful and desperate in their usual places at the fire-corner. “Samuel!” exclaimed Franz, pa l e as death itself,—“Samuel,—it remains for us now but to die! . . . Do you hear me? . . . We are worthless . . . worthless! We were two mad men to have hoped that anyone in this world would ever rival . . . him ! — “The name of Paganini stuck in his throat as in utter despair he fell into his arm-chair. The old professor’s wrinkles suddenly became purple; and his little greenish eyes gleamed phosphorescently as, bending toward his pupil, he whispered to him in a hoarse and broken voice—“Thou art wrong, my Franz! I have taught thee, and thou hast learned all of the great art that one simple mortal and a good Christian can learn from another and as simple a mortal as himself. Am I to be blamed because these accursed Italians, in order to reign unequalled in the domain of art, have recourse to Satan and the diabolical effects of black magic?” Franz turned his eyes upon his old master. There was a sinister light burning in those glittering orbs; a light telling plainly that to secure such a power, he too, would not scruple to sell himself, body and soul, to the Evil One. Samuel understood the cruel thought, but yet went on with feigned calmness—“You have heard the unfortunate tale rumoured about the famous Tartini? He died on one Sabbath night, strangled by his familiar demon, who had taught him the way, by means of incantations, to animate his violin, with a human soul, by shutting up in it the soul of a young Virgin . . . Paganini did more; in order to endow his instrument with the faculty of emitting human sobs, despairing cries, in short the most heart-rending notes of the human voice, Paganini became the murderer of a friend, who was more tenderly attached to him than any other on this earth. He then made out of the intestines of his victim the four cords of his magic violin. This is the secret of his enchanting talent, of that overpowering melody, and that combination of sounds, which you will never be able to master, u nless. . .” The old ma n could not finish the sentence. He staggered before the fiendish look of his pupil, and covered his face T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  223 with his h ands. “And, . . . you really believe . . . that had I the means of obtaining human"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"intestines for strings, I could rival Paganini?” asked Franz, after a moment’s pause, and casting down his eyes. The old German unveiled his face, and, with a strange look of determination upon it, softly answered. “Human intestines only are not sufficient for the purpose: these must have belonged to one that has loved us well, and with an unselfish, holy love. Tartini endowed his violin with the life of a virgin; but that virgin had died of unrequited love for him . . . The fiendish artist had prepared beforehand a tube in which he managed to catch her last breath as she expired in pronouncing his beloved name, and then transferred this breath into his violin.* As to Paganini—I have just told you his tale. It was with the consent of his victim though, that he murdered him to get possession of his intestines . . . Oh for the power of the human voice!” Samuel went on, after a brief pause: “What can equal the eloquence, the magic spell, of the human voice! Do you think, my poor boy, I would not have taught you this great, this final secret, were it not, that it throws one right into the clutches of him . . . who must remain unnamed at night?” Franz did not answer. With a calm, awful to behold, he left his place, took down his violin from the wall where it was hanging, and with one powerful grasp of the cords tore them out and flung them into the fire. The old Samuel suppressed a cry of horror. The cords were hissing upon the coals, where, among the blazing logs, they wriggled and curled like so many living snakes. Weeks and months passed away. This conversation was never resumed between the master and the pupil. But a –––––––––– *Giuseppe Tartini, the great Italian composer and violinist of the XVIIth century, produced such an impressio n by his inspired performance that he was commonly styled the “Master of Nations.” He eloped with a high-born young lady of great beauty.

The violin hung mute, cordless, and full of dust, upon its habitual place. It was like the presence of a soulless corpse between them. One night, as Franz sat, looking particularly pale and gloomy, old Samuel, suddenly jumped from his seat, and after hopping about the room in a magpie fashion approached his pupil, imprinted a fond kiss upon the young man’s brow, and then squeaked at the top of his voice, “It is time to put an end to all this!” . . . Whereupon starting from his usual lethargy, Franz echoed, as in a dream:—“Yes, it is time to put an end to this.” Upon which the two separated and went to bed. On the following morning, when Franz awoke, he was astonished at not seeing his old teacher at his usual place to give him his first greeting. “Samuel! My good, my dear . . . Samuel! ” exclaimed Franz, as he hurriedly jumped from his bed to go into his master’s chamber. He staggered back frightened at the sound of his own voice, so"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"changed and hoarse it seemed to him at this moment. No answer came in response to his call. Naught followed but a dead silence . . . There exists in the domain of sounds, a silence which usually denotes death.

Samuel was lying on his bed, cold, stiff and lifeless . . . At the sight of him, who had loved him so well, and had been more than a father, Franz experienced a dreadful shock. But the passion of the fanatical artist got the better of the despair of the man, and smothered the feelings of the latter. A note addressed with his own name was conspicuously placed upon a table near the corpse. With a trembling hand, the violinist tore open the envelope, and read the following:— M Y B ELOVED F RANZ , When you read this, I will have made the greatest sacrifice your best and only friend and professor could ha v e accomplished, for your T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  225 fame. He, who loved you most, is now but an inanimate body; of your old teacher there now remains but a clod of c old organic matter. I need not prompt you as to what you have to do with it. Fear not stupid prejudices. It is for your future fame that I have made an offering of my body, and you would become guilty of the blackest ingratitude, were you now to render this sacrifice useless. When you shall have replaced the cords upon your violin and these cords—a portion of my own self,—will acquire under your touch my voice, my groans, my song of welcome, and the sobs of my infinite love for you, my boy,—then, oh, Franz, fear nobody! Take your instrument along with you, and follow the steps of him who filled our lives with bitterness and despair. . . . Appear on the arena, where, hitherto, he has reigned without a rival, and bravely throw the gauntlet of defiance into his face. Oh, Franz! then only wilt thou hear with what a magic power the full note of love will issue forth from thy violin; as with a last caressing touch of its cords, thou wilt, perhaps, remember that they have once formed a portion of thine old teacher, who now embraces and blesses thee for the last time.— S AMUEL . Two burni n g tears sparkled in the eyes of Franz, but they dried up instantly under the fiery rush of passionate hope and pride. The eyes of the future magician-artist, riveted to the ghastly face of the corpse, shone like the eyes of the church owl. Our pen refuses to describe what took place later on that day, in the death room, after the legal autopsy was over. Suffice to say, that, after a fortnight had passed, the violin was dusted and four new stout cords had been stretched upon it. Franz dared not look at them. He tried to play, but the bow trembled in his hand like a dagger in the grasp of a novice-brigand. He made a vow not to try again until the portentous night when he should have a chance to rival—nay, surpass Paganini. But the famous violinist had left Paris and was now giving a series of triumphant concerts at an old Flemish town in Belgium. One night, as Paganini sat in the bar room of the hotel at which he stopped, surrounded by a crowd of admirers, a visiting-card was handed to him which had a few"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"words written in pencil upon its back, by a young man with wild and staring eyes. Fixing upon the intruder a look which 226  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS few persons could bear, but receiving back a glance as determined and calm as his own, Paganin i slightly bowed and then dryly said:—“Sir, it will be as you desire . . . name the night . . . I am at your service . . .” On the following morning the whole town was startled at the sight of numerous bills posted at the corner of every street. The strange notice ran thus:— Tonight at the Grand Theatre of , and for the first time , will appear before the public , Franz Stenio , a German Violinist , arrived purposely to throw the gauntlet at , and challenge the world-famous Paganini to a duel—upon their violins . He purposes to compete with the great “ virtuoso ” in the execution of the most difficult of his compositions . The famous Paganini has accepted the challenge . Franz Stenio will have to play in competition with the unrivalled violinist the celebrated “ Fantaisie caprice ” of the latter , known as “ The Witches .” The effect of the notice proved magical. Paganini, who amid his greatest triumphs, never lo s t sight of a profitable speculation, doubled the usual price of admission. But still the theatre could not hold the crowds that flocked to it on that memorable night. At the terrible hour of the forthcoming struggle, Franz was at his post, calm, resolute, almost smiling. It was arranged that Paganini should begin. When he appeared upon the stage, the thick walls of the theatre shook to their foundation with the applause that greeted him. He began and ended his famous composition The Witches amid uninterrupted bravos. The cries of public enthusiasm lasted so long that Franz began to think that his turn would never come. When at last, Paganini, amid the roaring applause of a frantic public, was allowed to retire behind the scenes, and his eye fell upon Stenio, who was tuning his violin, he felt amazed at the serene calmness, and the air of assurance of the unknown German artist. When Franz approached the footlights, he was received with an icy coldness. But for all that he did not feel in the least disconcerted: he only scornfully smiled, for he was sure of his triumph. At the first notes of the Prelude of “ The Witches ” the audience became dumb struck with astonishment. It was T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  227 Paganin i ’s touch, and—it was something else besides. Some—and that some the majority—thought that never, in his best moments of inspiration had the Italian artist himself, while executing this diabolical composition of his, exhibited such an equally"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"diabolical power. Under the pressure of the long muscular fingers, the cords wriggled like the palpitating intestines of a disembowelled victim, the Satanic eye of the artist fixed upon the soundboard, called forth hell itself out of the mysterious depths of his instrument. Sounds transformed themselves into shapes, and gathering thickly, at the evocation of the mighty magician, whirled around him, like a host of fantastic, infernal figures, dancing the witches’ “goat dance.” In the emptiness of the stage background behind him, a nameless phantasmagoria produced by the concussion of unearthly vibrations, seemed to draw pictures of shameless orgies, and the voluptuous hymens, of the witches’ Sabbath . . . A collective hallucination got hold of the public. Panting for breath, ghastly, and trickling with the icy perspiration of an inexpressible terror, they sat spellbound, and unable to break the charm of the music by the slightest motion. They experienced all the illicit enervating delights of the paradise of Mohammed that come into the discorded fancy of an opium-eating Mussulman, and felt at the same time the abject terror, the agony of one who struggles against an attack of delirium tremens . . .

An indescribable panic swept over the audience, and, breaking through the spell which had bound them for so long motionless in their seats, every living creature in the theatre made one mad rush to the door. It was like the sudden outburst of a dam; a human torrent, roaring amid a shower of discordant notes, idiotic squeaking, prolonged and whining moans, and cacophonous cries of frenzy, above which, like the detonations of pistol shots, was heard the consecutive bursting of the four cords upon the bewitched violin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"When the theatre was emptied of its last occupant, the terrified manager rushed on the stage in search of the unfortunate performer.

Press in London, and was placed on sale sometime during the Summer of 1892.] I In the ye a r 1828, an old German, a music teacher, came to Paris with his pupil and settled unostentatiously in one of the quiet faubourgs of the metropolis. The first rejoiced in the name of Samuel Klaus; the second answered to the more poetical appellation of Franz Stenio. The younger man was a violinist, gifted, as rumor went, with extraordinary, almost miraculous talent. Yet as he was poor and had not hitherto made a name for himself in Europe, he remained for several years in the capital of France—the heart and pulse of capricious continental fashion—unknown and unappreciated. Franz was a Styrian by birth, and, at the time of the event to be presently described, he was a young man considerably under thirty. A philosopher and a dreamer by nature, imbued with all the mystic oddities of true genius, he reminded one of some of the heroes in Hoffmann’s Contes Fantastiques . His earlier existence had been a very unusual, in fact, quite an eccentric one, and its history must be briefly told—for the better understanding of the present story. Born of very pious country people, in a quiet burg among the Styrian Alps; nursed “by the native gnomes who watched 230  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS over his cradle”; growing up in the weird atmosphere of the ghouls and vampires who play suc h a prominent part in the household of every Styrian and Slavonian in Southern Austria; educated later, as a student, in the shadow of the old Rhenish castles of Germany; Franz from his childhood had passed through every emotional stage on the plane of the so-called “supernatural.” He had also studied at one time the “occult arts” with an enthusiastic disciple of Paracelsus and Khunrath; alchemy had few theoretical secrets for him; and he had dabbled in “ceremonial magic” and “sorcery” with some Hungarian Tziganes. Yet he loved above all else music, and above music—his violin. At the age of twenty-two he suddenly gave up his practical studies in the occult, and"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"from that day, though as devoted as ever in thought to the beautiful Grecian Gods, he surrendered himself entirely to his art. Of his classic studies he had retained only that which related to the muses—Euterpe especially, at whose altar he worshipped—and Orpheus whose magic lyre he tried to emulate with his violin. Except his dreamy belief in the nymphs and the sirens, on account probably of the double relationship of the latter to the muses through Calliope and Orpheus, he was interested but little in the matters of this sublunary world. All his aspirations mounted, like incense, with the wave of the heavenly harmony that he drew from his instrument, to a higher and nobler sphere. He dreamed awake, and lived a real though an enchanted life only during those hours when his magic bow carried him along the wave of sound to the Pagan Olympus, to the feet of Euterpe. A strange child he had ever been in his own home, where tales of magic and witchcraft grow out of every inch of the soil; a still stranger boy he had become, until finally he had blossomed into manhood, without one single characteristic of youth. Never had a fair face attracted his attention; not for one moment had his thoughts turned from his solitary studies to a life beyond that of a mystic Bohemian. Content with his own company, he had thus passed the best years of his youth and manhood with his violin for his chief idol and with the Gods and Goddesses of old Greece for his T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  231 a u d i e n c e , in perfect ignorance of practical life. His whole existence had been one long day of dreams, of melody and sunlight, and he had never felt any other aspirations. How useless, but oh, how glorious those dreams! how vivid! and why should he desire any better fate? Was he not all that he wanted to be, transformed in a second of thought into one or another hero; from Orpheus, who held all nature breathless, to the urchin who piped away under the plane tree to the naiads of Callirrhoë’s crystal fountain? Did not the swift-footed nymphs frolic at his beck and call to the sound of the magic flute of the Arcadian shepherd—who was himself? Behold, the Goddess of Love and Beauty herself descending from on high, attracted by the sweet-voiced notes of his violin! . . . Yet there came a time when he preferred Syrinx to Aphrodite—not as the fair nymph pursued by Pan, but after her transformation by the merciful Gods into the reed out of which the frustrated God of the Shepherds had made his magic pipe. For also, with time, ambition grows and is rarely satisfied. When he tried to emulate on his violin the enchanting sounds that resounded in his mind, the whole of Parnassus kept silent under the spell, or joined in heavenly chorus; but the audience he finally craved was composed of more than the Gods sung by Hesiod, verily of the most appreciative mélomanes of European capitals. He felt jealous of the magic pipe, and would faint have had it at his command. “Oh! that I could allure a nymph into my beloved violin!”—he often cried, after awakening from one of his daydreams. “Oh, that I could only span in spirit-flight the abyss of Time! Oh, that I could find myself for one short day a partaker of the secret arts of the Gods, a God myself, in the sight and hearing of enraptured humanity; and, having"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"learned the mystery of the lyre of Orpheus, or secured within my violin a siren, thereby benefit mortals to my own glory!” Thus, having for long years dreamed in the company of the Gods of his fancy, he now took to dreaming of the transitory glories of fame upon this earth. But at this time he was suddenly called home by his widowed mother from 232  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS one of the German universities where he had lived for the last year or two. This was an event wh i ch brought his plans to an end, at least so far as the immediate future was concerned, for he had hitherto drawn upon her alone for his meagre pittance, and his means were not sufficient for an independent life outside his native place. His return had a very unexpected result. His mother, whose only love he was on earth, died soon after she had welcomed her Benjamin back; and the good wives of the burg exercised their swift tongues for many a month after as to the real causes of that death. Frau Stenio, before Franz’s return, was a healthy, buxom, middle-aged body, strong and hearty. She was a pious and a God-fearing soul too, who had never failed in saying her prayers, nor had missed an early mass for years during his absence. On the first Sunday after her son had settled at home—a day that she had been longing for and had anticipated for months in joyous visions, in which she saw him kneeling by her side in the little church on the hill—she called him from the foot of the stairs. The hour had come when her pious dream was to be realized, and she was waiting for him, carefully wiping the dust from the prayer-book he had used in his boyhood. But instead of Franz, it was his violin that responded to her call, mixing its sonorous voice with the rather cracked tones of the peal of the merry Sunday bells. The fond mother was somewhat shocked at hearing the prayer-inspiring sounds drowned by the weird, fantastic notes of the “Dance of the Witches”; they seemed to her so unearthly and mocking. But she almost fainted upon hearing the definite refusal of her well-beloved son to go to church. He never went to church, he coolly remarked. It was loss of time; besides which, the loud peals of the old church organ jarred on his nerves. Nothing should induce him to submit to the torture of listening to that cracked organ. He was firm, and nothing could move him. To her supplications and remonstrances he put an end by offering to play for her a “Hymn to the Sun” he had just composed. From that memorable Sunday morning, Frau Stenio lost T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  233 her usua l serenity of mind. She hastened to lay her sorrows and seek for consolation at"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"the foot of the confessional; but that which she heard in response from the stern priest filled her gentle and unsophisticated soul with dismay and almost with despair. A feeling of fear, a sense of profound terror, which soon became a chronic state with her, pursued her from that moment; her nights became disturbed and sleepless, her days passed in prayer and lamentations. In her maternal anxiety for the salvation of her beloved son’s soul, and for his post-mortem welfare, she made a series of rash vows. Finding that neither the Latin petition to the Mother of God written for her by her spiritual adviser, nor yet the humble supplications in German, addressed by herself to every saint she had reason to believe was residing in Paradise, worked the desired effect, she took to pilgrimages to distant shrines. During one of these journeys to a holy chapel situated high up in the mountains, she caught cold, amidst the glaciers of the Tyrol, and redescended only to take to a sick bed, from which she arose no more. Frau Stenio’s vow had led her, in one sense, to the desired result. The poor woman was now given an opportunity of seeking out in propria persona the saints she had believed in so well, and of pleading face to face for the recreant son, who refused adherence to them and to the Church, scoffed at monk and confessional, and held the organ in such horror. Franz sincerely lamented his mother’s death. Unaware of being the indirect cause of it, he felt no remorse; but selling the modest household goods and chattels, light in purse and heart, he resolved to travel on foot for a year or two, before settling down to any definite profession. A hazy desire to see the great cities of Europe, and to try his luck in France, lurked at the bottom of this travelling project, but his Bohemian habits of life were too strong to be abruptly abandoned. He placed his small capital with a banker for a rainy day, and started on his pedestrian journey via Germany and Austria. His violin paid for his board and lodging in the inns and farms on his way, and he passed his days in the green fields and in the solemn silent woods, face to face with Nature, dreaming all the time as usual with 234  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS his eyes open. During the three months of his pleasant travels to and fro, he never descend e d for one moment from Parnassus; but, as an alchemist transmutes lead into gold, so he transformed everything on his way into a song of Hesiod or Anacreon. Every evening, while fiddling for his supper and bed, whether on a green lawn or in the hall of a rustic inn, his fancy changed the whole scene for him. Village swains and maidens became transfigured into Arcadian shepherds and nymphs. The sand-covered floor was now a green sward; the uncouth couples spinning round in a measured waltz with the wild grace of tamed bears became priests and priestesses of Terpsichore; the bulky, cherry-cheeked and blue-eyed daughters of rural Germany were the Hesperides circling around the trees laden with the golden apples. Nor did the melodious strains of the Arcadian demigods piping on their syrinxes, and audible but to his own enchanted ear, vanish with the dawn. For no sooner was the curtain of sleep raised from his eyes than"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"he would sally forth into a new magic realm of day-dreams. On his way to some dark and solemn pine forest, he played incessantly, to himself and to everything else. He fiddled to the green hill, and forthwith the mountain and the moss-covered rocks moved forward to hear him the better, as they had done at the sound of the Orphean lyre. He fiddled to the merry-voiced brook, to the hurrying river, and both slackened their speed and stopped their waves, and, becoming silent, seemed to listen to him in an entranced rapture. Even the long-legged stork who stood meditatively on one leg on the thatched top of the rustic mill, gravely resolving unto himself the problem of his too-long existence, sent out after him a long and strident cry, screeching, “Art thou Orpheus himself, O Stenio?” It was a period of full bliss, of a daily and almost hourly exaltation. The last words of his dying mother, whispering to him of the horrors of eternal condemnation, had left him unaffected, and the only vision her warning evoked in him was that of Pluto. By a ready association of ideas, he saw the lord of the dark nether kingdom greeting him as he had greeted the husband of Eurydice before him. Charmed with the magic sounds of his violin, T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  235 t h e w h e e l of Ixion was at a standstill once more, thus affording relief to the wretched seducer of Juno, and giving the lie to those who claim eternity for the duration of the punishment of condemned sinners. He perceived Tantalus forgetting his never-ceasing thirst, and smacking his lips as he drank in the heaven-born melody; the stone of Sisyphus becoming motionless, the Furies themselves smiling on him, and the sovereign of the gloomy regions delighted, and awarding preference to his violin over the lyre of Orpheus. Taken au sérieux , mythology thus seems a decided antidote to fear, in the face of theological threats, especially when strengthened with an insane and passionate love of music; with Franz, Euterpe proved always victorious in every contest, aye, even with Hell itself! But there is an end to everything, and very soon Franz had to give up uninterrupted dreaming. He had reached the university town where dwelt his old violin teacher, Samuel Klaus. When this antiquated musician found that his beloved and favourite pupil, Franz, had been left poor in purse and still poorer in earthly affections, he felt his strong attachment to the boy awaken with tenfold force. He took Franz to his heart, and forthwith adopted him as his son. The old teacher reminded people of one of those grotesque figures which look as if they had just stepped out of some mediaeval panel. And yet Klaus, with his fantastic allures of a night-goblin, had the most loving heart, as tender as that of a woman, and the self-sacrificing nature of an old Christian martyr. When Franz had briefly narrated to him the history of his last few years, the professor took him by the hand, and leading him into his study simply said: “Stop with me, and put an end to your Bohemian life. Make yourself famous. I am old and childless and will be your father. Let us live together and forget all save fame.”"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"And forthwith he offered to proceed with Franz to Paris, via several large German cities, where they would stop to give concerts. In a few days Klaus succeeded in making Franz forget his vagrant life and its artistic independence, and reawakened in his pupil his now dormant ambition and desire for 236  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS worldly fame. Hitherto, since his mother’s death, he had been content to receive applaus e only from the Gods and Goddesses who inhabited his vivid fancy; now he began to crave once more for the admiration of mortals. Under the clever and careful training of old Klaus his remarkable talent gained in strength and powerful charm with every day, and his reputation grew and expanded with every city and town wherein he made himself heard. His ambition was being rapidly realized; the presiding genii of various musical centres to whose patronage his talent was submitted soon proclaimed him the one violinist of the day, and the public declared loudly that he stood unrivalled by any one whom they had ever heard. These laudations very soon made both master and pupil completely lose their heads. But Paris was less ready with such appreciation. Paris makes reputations for itself, and will take none on faith. They had been living in it for almost three years, and were still climbing with difficulty the artist’s Calvary, when an event occurred which put an end even to their most modest expectations. The first arrival of Nicolo Paganini was suddenly heralded, and threw Lutetia into a convulsion of expectation. The unparalled artist arrived, and—all Paris fell at once at his feet. II Now it is a well-known fact that a superstition born in the dark days of mediaeval superstition, and surviving almost to the middle of the present century, attributed all such abnormal, out-of-the-way talent as that of Paganini to “supernatural” agency. Every great and marvellous artist had been accused in his day of dealings with the devil. A few instances will suffice to refresh the reader’s memory. Tartini, the great composer and violinist of the XVIIth century, was denounced as one who got his best inspirations from the Evil One, with whom he was, it was said, in regular league. This accusation was, of course, due to the almost magical impression he produced upon his audiences. His T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  237 inspire d performance on the violin secured for him in his native country the title of “Master of Nations.” The Sonate du Diable , also called “Tartini’s Dream”—as every one"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"who has heard it will be ready to testify—is the most weird melody ever heard or invented: hence, the marvellous composition has become the source of endless legends. Nor were they entirely baseless, since it was he, himself, who was shown to have originated them. Tartini confessed to having written it on awakening from a dream, in which he had heard his sonata performed by Satan, for his benefit, and in consequence of a bargain made with his infernal majesty. Several famous singers, even, whose exceptional voices struck the hearers with superstitious admiration, have not escaped a like accusation. Pasta’s splendid voice was attributed in her day to the fact that, three months before her birth, the diva’s mother was carried during a trance to heaven, and there treated to a vocal concert of seraphs. Malibran was indebted for her voice to St. Cecilia, while others said she owed it to a demon who watched over her cradle and sang the baby to sleep. Finally, Paganini—the unrivalled performer, the mean Italian, who like Dryden’s Jubal striking on the “chorded shell” forced the throngs that followed him to worship the divine sounds produced, and made people say that “less than a God could not dwell within the hollow of his violin”—Paganini left a legend too. The almost supernatural art of the greatest violin-player that the world has ever known was often speculated upon, never understood. The effect produced by him on his audience was literally marvellous, overpowering. The great Rossini is said to have wept like a sentimental German maiden on hearing him play for the first time. The Princess Elisa of Lucca, a sister of the great Napoleon, in whose service Paganini was, as director of her private orchestra, for a long time was unable to hear him play without fainting. In women he produced nervous fits and hysterics at his will; stout-hearted men he drove to frenzy. He changed cowards into heroes and made the bravest soldiers feel like so many nervous schoolgirls. Is it to be wondered at, then, that hundreds of weird tales circulated for long years about and 238  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS around the mysterious Genoese, that modern Orpheus of Europe? One of these was especia l ly ghastly. It was rumoured, and was believed by more people than would probably like to confess it, that the strings of his violin were made of human intestines , according to all the rules and requirements of the Black Art . Exaggerated as this idea may seem to some, it has nothing impossible in it; and it is more than probable that it was this legend that led to the extraordinary events which we are about to narrate. Human organs are often used by the Eastern Black Magician, so-called, and it is an averred fact that some Bengâlî Tântrikas (reciters of tantras , or “invocations to the demon,” as a reverend writer has described them) use human corpses, and certain internal and external organs pertaining to them, as powerful magical agents for bad purposes. However this may be, now that the magnetic and mesmeric potencies of hypnotism are recognized as facts by most physicians, it may be suggested with less danger than"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"heretofore that the extraordinary effects of Paganini’s violin-playing were not, perhaps, entirely due to his talent and genius. The wonder and awe he so easily excited were as much caused by his external appearance, “which had something weird and demoniacal in it,” according to certain of his biographers, as by the inexpressible charm of his execution and his remarkable mechanical skill. The latter is demonstrated by his perfect imitation of the flageolet, and his performance of long and magnificent melodies on the G string alone. In this performance, which many an artist has tried to copy without success, he remains unrivalled to this day. It is owing to this remarkable appearance of his—termed by his friends eccentric, and by his too nervous victims, diabolical—that he experienced great difficulties in refuting certain ugly rumours. These were credited far more easily in his day than they would be now. It was whispered throughout Italy, and even in his own native town, that Paganini had murdered his wife, and, later on, a mistress, both of whom he had loved passionately, and both of whom he had T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  239 n o t h e s i t ated to sacrifice to his fiendish ambition. He had made himself proficient in magic arts, it was asserted, and had succeeded thereby in imprisoning the souls of his two victims in his violin—his famous Cremona. It is maintained by the immediate friends of Ernest T. W. Hoffmann, the celebrated author of Die Elixire des Teufels , Meister Martin , and other charming and mystical tales, that Councillor Crespel, in the Violin of Cremona , was taken from the legend about Paganini. It is, as all who have read it know, the history of a celebrated violin, into which the voice and the soul of a famous diva, a woman whom Crespel had loved and killed, had passed, and to which was added the voice of his beloved daughter, Antonia. Nor was this superstition utterly ungrounded, nor was Hoffmann to be blamed for adopting it, after he had heard Paganini’s playing. The extraordinary facility with which the artist drew out of his instrument, not only the most unearthly sounds, but positively human voices, justified the suspicion. Such effects might well have startled an audience and thrown terror into many a nervous heart. Add to this the impenetrable mystery connected with a certain period of Paganini’s youth, and the most wild tales about him must be found in a measure justifiable, and even excusable; especially among a nation whose ancestors knew the Borgias and the Medicis of Black Art fame. III In those pre-telegraphic days, newspapers were limited, and the wings of fame had a heavier flight than they have now. Franz had hardly heard of Paganini; and when he did, he swore he would rival, if not eclipse, the Genoese magician. Yes, he would either become the most famous of all living violinists, or he would break his instrument and put an end to his life at the same time."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Old Klaus rejoiced at such a determination. He rubbed his hands in glee, and jumping about on his lame leg like 240  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS a crippled satyr, he flattered and incensed his pupil, believing himself all the while to be perform i ng a sacred duty to the holy and majestic cause of art. Upon first setting foot in Paris, three years before, Franz had all but failed. Musical critics pronounced him a rising star, but had all agreed that he required a few more years’ practice, before he could hope to carry his audiences by storm. Therefore, after a desperate study of over two years and uninterrupted preparations, the Styrian artist had finally made himself ready for his first serious appearance in the great Opera House where a public concert before the most exacting critics of the old world was to be held; at this critical moment Paganini’s arrival in the European metropolis placed an obstacle in the way of the realization of his hopes, and the old German professor wisely postponed his pupil’s début . At first he had simply smiled at the wild enthusiasm, the laudatory hymns sung about the Genoese violinist, and the almost superstitious awe with which his name was pronounced. But very soon Paganini’s name became a burning iron in the hearts of both the artists, and a threatening phantom in the mind of Klaus. A few days more, and they shuddered at the very mention of their great rival, whose success became with every night more unprecedented. The first series of concerts was over, but neither Klaus nor Franz had as yet had an opportunity of hearing him and of judging for themselves. So great and so beyond their means was the charge for admission, and so small the hope of getting a free pass from a brother artist justly regarded as the meanest of men in monetary transactions that they had to wait for a chance, as did so many others. But the day came when neither master nor pupil could control their impatience any longer; so they pawned their watches, and with the proceeds bought two modest seats. Who can describe the enthusiasm, the triumphs, of this famous, and at the same time fatal night! The audience was frantic; men wept and women screamed and fainted; while both Klaus and Stenio sat looking paler than two ghosts. At the first touch of Paganini’s magic bow, both Franz and T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  241 Samuel f e lt as if the icy hand of death had touched them. Carried away by an irresistible enthusiasm, which turned into a violent, unearthly mental torture, they dared neither look into each other’s faces, nor exchange one word during the whole performance. At midnight, while the chosen delegates of the Musical Societies and the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Conservatory of Paris unhitched the horses, and dragged the carriage of the grand artist home in triumph, the two Germans returned to their modest lodging, and it was a pitiful sight to see them. Mournful and desperate, they placed themselves in their usual seats at the fire corner, and neither for a while opened his mouth. “Samuel!” at last exclaimed Franz, pale as death itself. “Samuel—it remains for us now but to die! . . . Do you hear me? . . . We are worthless! We were two madmen to have ever hoped that any one in this world would ever rival . . . him!” The name of Paganini stuck in his throat, as in utter despair he fell into his arm chair. The old professor’s wrinkles suddenly became purple. His little greenish eyes gleamed phosphorescently as, bending toward his pupil, he whispered to him in hoarse and broken tones: “ Nein , nein ! Thou art wrong, my Franz! I have taught thee, and thou hast learned all of the great art that a simple mortal, and a Christian by baptism, can learn from another simple mortal. Am I to blame because these accursed Italians, in order to reign unequalled in the domain of art, have recourse to Satan and the diabolical effects of Black Magic?” Franz turned his eyes upon his old master. There was a sinister light burning in those glittering orbs; a light telling plainly, that, to secure such a power, he, too, would not scruple to sell himself, body and soul, to the Evil One. But he said not a word, and, turning his eyes from his old master’s face, he gazed dreamily at the dying embers. The same long-forgotten incoherent dreams, which, after seeming such realities to him in his younger days, had been given up entirely, and had gradually faded from his mind, 242  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS now crowded back into it with the same force and vividness as of old. The grimacing shades o f Ixion, Sisyphus and Tantalus resurrected and stood before him, saying: “What matters hell—in which thou believest not. And even if hell there be, it is the hell described by the old Greeks, not that of the modern bigots—a locality full of conscious shadows, to whom thou canst be a second Orpheus.” Franz felt that he was going mad, and, turning instinctively, he looked his old master once more right in the face. Then his bloodshot eye evaded the gaze of Klaus. Whether Samuel understood the terrible state of mind of his pupil, or whether he wanted to draw him out, to make him speak, and thus to divert his thoughts, must remain as hypothetical to the reader as it is to the writer. Whatever may have been in his mind, the German enthusiast went on, speaking with a feigned calmness: “Franz, my dear boy, I tell you that the art of the accursed Italian is not natural; that it is due neither to study nor to genius. It never was acquired in the usual, natural way. You need not stare at me in that wild manner, for what I say is in the mouth of millions of people. Listen to what I now tell you, and try to understand. You have heard the"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"strange tale whispered about the famous Tartini? He died one fine Sabbath night, strangled by his familiar demon, who had taught him how to endow his violin with a human voice, by shutting up in it, by means of incantations, the soul of a young virgin. Paganini did more. In order to endow his instrument with the faculty of emitting human sounds, such as sobs, despairing cries, supplications, moans of love and fury—in short, the most heart-rending notes of the human voice—Paganini became the murderer not only of his wife and his mistress, but also of a friend, who was more tenderly attached to him than any other being on this earth. He then made the four chords of his magic violin out of the intestines of his last victim. This is the secret of his enchanting talent, of that overpowering melody, that combination of sounds, which you will never be able to master, unless . . .” T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  243 The old ma n could not finish the sentence. He staggered back before the fiendish look of his pupil, and covered his face with his hands. Franz was breathing heavily, and his eyes had an expression which reminded Klaus of those of a hyena. His pallor was cadaverous. For some time he could not speak, but only gasped for breath. At last he slowly muttered: “Are you in earnest?” “I am, as I hope to help you.” “And . . . and do you really believe that had I only the means of obtaining human intestines for strings, I could rival Paganini?” asked Franz, after a moment’s pause, and casting down his eyes. The old German unveiled his face, and, with a strange look of determination upon it, softly answered: “Human intestines alone are not sufficient for our purpose; they must have belonged to some one who had loved us well, with an unselfish holy love. Tartini endowed his violin with the life of a virgin; but that virgin had died of unrequited love for him. The fiendish artist had prepared beforehand a tube, in which he managed to catch her last breath as she expired, pronouncing his beloved name, and he then transferred this breath to his violin. As to Paganini, I have just told you his tale. It was with the consent of his victim, though, that he murdered him to get possession of his intestines. “Oh, for the power of the human voice!” Samuel went on, after a brief pause. “What can equal the eloquence, the magic spell of the human voice? Do you think, my poor boy, I would not have taught you this great, this final secret, were it not that it throws one right into the clutches of him . . . who must remain unnamed at night?” he added, with a sudden return to the superstitions of his youth. Franz did not answer; but with a calmness awful to behold, he left his place, took down his violin from the wall where it was hanging, and, with one powerful grasp of the chords, he tore them out and flung them into the fire. Samuel suppressed a cry of horror. The chords were"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"244  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS hissing upon the coals, where, among the blazing logs, they wriggled and curled like so many liv i ng snakes. “By the witches of Thessaly and the dark arts of Circe!” he exclaimed, with foaming mouth and his eyes burning like coals; “by the Furies of Hell and Pluto himself, I now swear, in thy presence, O Samuel, my master, never to touch a violin again until I can string it with four human chords. May I be accursed for ever and ever if I do!” He fell senseless on the floor, with a deep sob, that ended like a funeral wail; old Samuel lifted him up as he would have lifted a child, and carried him to his bed. Then he sallied forth in search of a physician. IV For several days after this painful scene Franz was very ill, ill almost beyond recovery. The physician declared him to be suffering from brain fever and said that the worst was to be feared. For nine long days the patient remained delirious; and Klaus, who was nursing him night and day with the solicitude of the tenderest mother, was horrified at the work of his own hands. For the first time since their acquaintance began, the old teacher, owing to the wild ravings of his pupil, was able to penetrate into the darkest corners of that weird, superstitious, cold, and, at the same time, passionate nature; and—he trembled at what he discovered. For he saw that which he had failed to perceive before Franz as he was in reality, and not as he seemed to superficial observers. Music was the life of the young man, and adulation was the air he breathed, without which that life became a burden; from the chords of his violin alone, Stenio drew his life and being, but the applause of men and even of Gods was necessary to its support. He saw unveiled before his eyes a genuine, artistic, earthly soul, with its divine counterpart totally absent, a son of the Muses, all fancy and brain poetry, but without a heart. While listening to the ravings of that delirious and unhinged fancy Klaus felt as if he were for the first time in his long life exploring a T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  245 marvell o us and untravelled region, a human nature not of this world but of some incomplete planet. He saw all this and shuddered. More than once he asked himself whether it would not be doing a kindness to his “boy” to let him die before he returned to consciousness. But he loved his pupil too well to dwell for long on such an idea. Franz had bewitched his truly artistic nature, and now old Klaus felt as though their two lives were inseparably linked together. That he could thus feel was a revelation to the old man; so"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"he decided to save Franz, even at the expense of his own old, and, as he thought, useless life. The seventh day of the illness brought on a most terrible. crisis. For twenty-four hours the patient never closed his eyes, nor remained for a moment silent; he raved continuously during the whole time. His visions were peculiar, and he minutely described each. Fantastic, ghastly figures kept slowly swimming out of the penumbra of his small, dark room, in regular and uninterrupted procession, and he greeted each by name as he might greet old acquaintances. He referred to himself as Prometheus, bound to the rock by four bands made of human intestines. At the foot of the Caucasian Mount the black waters of the river Styx were running . . . They had deserted Arcadia, and were now endeavouring to encircle within a sevenfold embrace the rock upon which he was suffering . . . “Wouldst thou know the name of the Promethean rock, old man?’’ he roared into his adopted father’s ear . . . “Listen then . . . its name is . . . called . . . Samuel Klaus . . .” “Yes, yes! . . .” the German murmured disconsolately. “It is I who killed him, while seeking to console. The news of Paganini’s magic arts struck his fancy too vividly . . . Oh, my poor, poor boy!” “Ha, ha, ha, ha!” The patient broke into a loud and discordant laugh. “Aye, poor old man, sayest thou? . . . So, so, thou art of poor stuff, anyhow, and wouldst look well only when stretched upon a fine Cremona violin! . . .” Klaus shuddered, but said nothing. He only bent over the poor maniac, and with a kiss upon his brow, a caress 246  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS as tender and as gentle as that of a doting mother, he left the sickroom for a few instants, to seek r e lief in his own garret. When he returned, the ravings were following another channel. Franz was singing, trying to imitate the sounds of a violin. Toward the evening of that day, the delirium of the sick man became perfectly ghastly. He saw spirits of fire clutching at his violin. Their skeleton hands, from each finger of which grew a flaming claw, beckoned to old Samuel . . . They approached and surrounded the old master, and were preparing to rip him open . . . him, “the only man on this earth who loves me with an unselfish, holy love, and . . . whose intestines can be of any good at all!” he went on whispering, with glaring eyes and demon laugh . . . By the next morning, however, the fever had disappeared, and by the end of the ninth day Stenio had left his bed, having no recollection of his illness, and no suspicion that he had allowed Klaus to read his inner thought. Nay; had he himself any knowledge that such a horrible idea as the sacrifice of his old master to his ambition had ever entered his mind? Hardly. The only immediate result of his fatal illness was, that as, by reason of his vow, his artistic passion could find no issue, another passion awoke, which might avail to feed his ambition and his insatiable fancy. He plunged headlong into the study of the Occult Arts, of Alchemy and of Magic. In the practice of Magic the young"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"dreamer sought to stifle the voice of his passionate longing for his, as he thought, forever lost violin . . . Weeks and months passed away, and the conversation about Paganini was never resumed between the master and the pupil. But a profound melancholy had taken possession of Franz, the two hardly exchanged a word, the violin hung mute, chordless, full of dust, in its habitual place. It was as the presence of a soulless corpse between them. The young man had become gloomy and sarcastic, even avoiding the mention of music. Once, as his old professor, after long hesitation, took out his own violin from its dust-covered case and prepared to play, Franz gave a convulsive shudder, but said nothing. At the first notes of the bow, T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  247 however , h e glared like a madman, and rushing out of the house, remained for hours, wandering in the streets. Then old Samuel in his turn threw his instrument down, and locked himself up in his room till the following morning. One night as Franz sat, looking particularly pale and gloomy, old Samuel suddenly jumped from his seat, and after hopping about the room in a magpie fashion, approached his pupil, imprinted a fond kiss upon the young man’s brow, and squeaked at the top of his shrill voice: “Is it not time to put an end to all this?” . . . Whereupon, starting from his usual lethargy, Franz echoed, as in a dream: “Yes, it is time to put an end to this.” Upon which the two separated, and went to bed. On the following morning, when Franz awoke, he was astonished not to see his old teacher in his usual place to greet him. But he had greatly altered during the last few months, and he at first paid no attention to his absence, unusual as it was. He dressed and went into the adjoining room, a little parlour where they had their meals, and which separated their two bedrooms. The fire had not been lighted since the embers had died out on the previous night, and no sign was anywhere visible of the professor’s busy hand in his usual housekeeping duties. Greatly puzzled, but in no way dismayed, Franz took his usual place at the corner of the now cold fire-place, and fell into an aimless reverie. As he stretched himself in his old arm-chair, raising both his hands to clasp them behind his head in a favourite posture of his, his hand came into contact with something on a shelf at his back; he knocked against a case, and brought it violently on the ground. It was old Klaus’ violin-case that came down to the floor with such a sudden crash that the case opened and the violin fell out of it, rolling to the feet of Franz. And then the chords, striking against the brass fender emitted a sound, prolonged, sad and mournful as the sigh of an unrestful soul; it seemed to fill the whole room, and reverberated in the head and the very heart of the young man. The effect of that broken violin-string was magical."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"248  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS “Samuel!” cried Stenio, with his eyes starting from their sockets, and an unknown terror s u ddenly taking possession of his whole being. “Samuel! what has happened? . . . My good, my dear old master!” he called out, hastening to the professor’s little room, and throwing the door violently open. No one answered, all was silent within. He staggered back, frightened at the sound of his own voice, so changed and hoarse it seemed to him at this moment. No reply came in response to his call. Naught followed but a dead silence . . . that stillness which, in the domain of sounds, usually denotes death. In the presence of a corpse, as in the lugubrious stillness of a tomb, such silence acquires a mysterious power, which strikes the sensitive soul with a nameless terror . . . The little room was dark, and Franz hastened to open the shutters. Samuel was lying on his bed, cold, stiff, and lifeless . . . At the sight of the corpse of him who had loved him so well, and had been to him more than a father, Franz experienced a dreadful revulsion of feeling, a terrible shock. But the ambition of the fanatical artist got the better of the despair of the man, and smothered the feelings of the latter in a few seconds. A note bearing his own name was conspicuously placed upon a table near the corpse. With trembling hand, the violinist tore open the envelope, and read the following: M Y BELOVED SON , F RANZ , When you read this, I shall have made the greatest sacrifice, that your best and only friend and te a c h e r c ould have accomplished for your fame. He, who loved you most, is now but an inanimate lump of clay. Of your old teacher there now remains but a clod of cold organic matter. I need not prompt you as to what you have to do with it. Fear not stupid prejudices. It is for your future fame that I have made an offering of my body, and you would be guilty of the blackest ingratitude were you now to render useless this sacrifice. When you shall have replaced the chords upon your violin, and these chords a portion of my own self, under your touch it will acquire the power of that accursed sorcerer, all the magic voices of Paganini’s instrument. You will find therein my voice, my sighs and groans, my song of welcome, the prayerful sobs of my infinite and sorrowful sympathy, my love for you. And now, my Franz, fear nobody! Take your instrument with you, and dog the steps of him who filled our T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  249 lives with bitterness and despair! . . .

Perchance, with a last caressing touch of its chords, thou wilt remember that they once formed a portion of thine old teacher, who now embraces and blesses thee for the last time. S AMUEL . Two burni n g tears sparkled in the eyes of Franz, but they dried up instantly. Under the fiery rush of passionate hope and pride, the two orbs of the future magician-artist, riveted to the ghastly face of the dead man, shone like the eyes of a demon."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Our pen refuses to describe that which took place on that day, after the legal inquiry was over. As another note, written with the view of satisfying the authorities, had been prudently provided by the loving care of the old teacher, the verdict was, “Suicide from causes unknown”; after this the coroner and the police retired, leaving the bereaved heir alone in the death room, with the remains of that which had once been a living man. Scarcely a fortnight had elapsed from that day, ere the violin had been dusted, and four new, stout strings had been stretched upon it. Franz dared not look at them. He tried to play, but the bow trembled in his hand like a dagger in the grasp of a novice-brigand. He then determined not to try again, until the portentous night should arrive, when he should have a chance of rivalling, nay, of surpassing, Paganini. The famous violinist had meanwhile left Paris, and was giving a series of triumphant concerts at an old Flemish town in Belgium. V One night, as Paganini, surrounded by a crowd of admirers, was sitting in the dining-room of the hotel at which he was staying, a visiting card, with a few words written on 250  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS it in pencil, was handed to him by a young man with wild and staring eyes. Fixing u p on the intruder a look which few persons could bear, but receiving back a glance as calm and determined as his own, Paganini slightly bowed, and then dryly said: “Sir, it shall be as you desire. Name the night. I am at your service.” On the following morning the whole town was startled by the appearance of bills posted at the corner of every street, and bearing the strange notice: On the night of . . . , at the Grand Theatre of . . ., and for the first time, will appear before the public, Franz S te nio, a German violinist, arrived purposely to throw down the gauntlet to the world-famous Paganini and to challenge him to a duel—upon their violins. He purposes to compete with the great “virtuoso” in the execution of the most difficult of his compositions. The famous Paganini has accepted the challenge. Franz Stenio will play, in competition with the unrivalled violinist, the celebrated “Fantaisie Caprice” of the latter, known as “The Witches.” The effect of the notice was magical. Paganini, who, amid his greatest triumphs, never lo s t sight of a profitable speculation, doubled the usual price of admission, but still the theatre could not hold the crowds that flocked to secure tickets for that memorable performance. At last the morning of the concert day dawned, and the “duel” was in everyone’s mouth. Franz Stenio, who, instead of sleeping, had passed the whole long hours of the preceding midnight in walking up and down his room like an encased panther, had, toward morning, fallen on his bed from mere physical exhaustion. Gradually he passed into a deathlike and dreamless slumber. At the gloomy winter dawn he awoke, but finding it too early to rise he fell asleep again. And then he had a vivid dream—so vivid"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"indeed, so lifelike, that from its terrible realism he felt sure that it was a vision rather than a dream. He had left his violin on a table by his bedside, locked in its case, the key of which never left him. Since he had strung it with those terrible chords he never let it out of his sight for a moment. In accordance with his resolution he had T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  251 not touc h ed it since his first trial, and his bow had never but once touched the human strings, for he had since always practised on another instrument. But now in his sleep he saw himself looking at the locked case. Something in it was attracting his attention, and he found himself incapable of detaching his eyes from it. Suddenly he saw the upper part of the case slowly rising, and, within the chink thus produced, he perceived two small, phosphorescent green eyes—eyes but too familiar to him—fixing themselves on his, lovingly, almost beseechingly. Then a thin, shrill voice, as if issuing from these ghastly orbs—the voice and orbs of Samuel Klaus himself—resounded in Stenio’s horrified ear, and he heard it say: “Franz, my beloved boy . . . Franz, I cannot, no I cannot separate myself from . . . them !” And “they” twanged piteously inside the case. Franz stood speechless, horror-bound. He felt his blood actually freezing, and his hair moving and standing erect on his head . . . “It’s but a dream, an empty dream!” he attempted to formulate in his mind. “I have tried my best, Franzchen . . . I have tried my best to sever myself from these accursed strings, without pulling them to pieces . . .” pleaded the same shrill, familiar voice. “Wilt thou help me to do so? . . .” Another twang, still more prolonged and dismal, resounded within the case, now dragged about the table in every direction, by some interior power, like some living, wriggling thing, the twangs becoming sharper and more jerky with every new pull. It was not for the first time that Stenio heard those sounds. He had often remarked them before—indeed, ever since he had used his master’s viscera as a footstool for his own ambition. But on every occasion a feeling of creeping horror had prevented him from investigating their cause, and he had tried to assure himself that the sounds were only a hallucination. But now he stood face to face with the terrible fact, whether in dream or in reality he knew not, nor did he 252  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"care, since the hallucination—if hallucination it were—was far more real and vivid than any reality. He tried to speak, to take a step forward; but, as often happens in nightmares, he could neither utter a word nor move a finger . . . He felt hopelessly paralyzed. The pulls and jerks were becoming more desperate with each moment, and at last something inside the case snapped violently. The vision of his Stradivarius, devoid of its magical strings, flashed before his eyes throwing him into a cold sweat of mute and unspeakable terror. He made a superhuman effort to rid himself of the incubus that held him spell-bound. But as the last supplicating whisper of the invisible Presence repeated: “Do, oh, do . . . help me to cut myself off—” Franz sprang to the case with one bound, like an enraged tiger defending its prey, and with one frantic effort breaking the spell. “Leave the violin alone, you old fiend from hell!” he cried, in hoarse and trembling tones. He violently shut down the self-raising lid, and while firmly pressing his left hand on it, he seized with the right a piece of rosin from the table and drew on the leather-covered top the sign of the six-pointed star—the seal used by King Solomon to bottle up the rebellious djins inside their prisons. A wail, like the howl of a she-wolf moaning over her dead little ones, came out of the violin-case: “Thou art ungrateful . . . very ungrateful, my Franz!” sobbed the blubbering “spirit-voice.” “But I forgive . . . for I still love thee well. Yet thou canst not shut me in . . . boy. Behold!” And instantly a grayish mist spread over and covered case and table, and rising upward formed itself first into an indistinct shape. Then it began growing, and as it grew, Franz felt himself gradually enfolded in cold and damp coils, slimy as those of a huge snake. He gave a terrible cry and—awoke; but, strangely enough, not on his bed, but near the table, just as he had dreamed, pressing the violin case desperately with both his hands. T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  253 “It was b u t a dream . . . after all,” he muttered, still terrified, but relieved of the load on his heaving breast. With a tremendous effort he composed himself, and unlocked the case to inspect the violin. He found it covered with dust, but otherwise sound and in order, and he suddenly felt himself as cool and as determined as ever. Having dusted the instrument he carefully rosined the bow, tightened the strings and tuned them. He even went so far as to try upon it the first notes of the “Witches”; first cautiously and timidly, then using his bow boldly and with full force. The sound of that loud, solitary note—defiant as the war trumpet of a conqueror, sweet and majestic as the touch of a seraph on his golden harp in the fancy of the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"faithful—thrilled through the very soul of Franz. It revealed to him a hitherto unsuspected potency in his bow, which ran on in strains that filled the room with the richest swell of melody, unheard by the artist until that night. Commencing in uninterrupted legato tones, his bow sang to him of sun-bright hope and beauty, of moonlit nights, when the soft and balmy stillness endowed every blade of grass and all things animate and inanimate with a voice and a song of love. For a few brief moments it was a torrent of melody, the harmony of which, “tuned to soft woe,” was calculated to make mountains weep, had there been any in the room, and to soothe . . . even th’ inexorable powers of hell, the presence of which was undeniably felt in this modest hotel room. Suddenly, the solemn legato chant, contrary to all laws of harmony, quivered, became arpeggios , and ended in shrill staccatos , like the notes of a hyena laugh. The same creeping sensation of terror, as he had before felt, came over him, and Franz threw the bow away. He had recognized the familiar laugh, and would have no more of it. Dressing, he locked the bedevilled violin securely in its case, and, taking it with him to the dining-room, determined to await quietly the hour of trial. 254  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS VI The terri b le hour of the struggle had come, and Stenio was at his post calm, resolute, almost smiling. The theatre was crowded to suffocation, and there was not even standing room to be got for any amount of hard cash or favouritism. The singular challenge had reached every quarter to which the post could carry it, and gold flowed freely into Paganini’s unfathomable pockets, to an extent almost satisfying even to his insatiate and venal soul. It was arranged that Paganini should begin. When he appeared upon the stage, the thick walls of the theatre shook to their foundations with the applause that greeted him. He began and ended his famous composition “The Witches” amid a storm of cheers. The shouts of public enthusiasm lasted so long that Franz began to think his turn would never come. When, at last, Paganini, amid the roaring applause of a frantic public, was allowed to retire behind the scenes, his eye fell upon Stenio, who was tuning his violin, and he felt amazed at the serene calmness, the air of assurance, of the unknown German artist. When Franz approached the footlights, he was received with icy coldness. But for all that, he did not feel in the least disconcerted. He looked very pale, but his thin white lips wore a scornful smile as response to this dumb unwelcome. He was sure of his triumph. At the first notes of the prelude of “The Witches” a thrill of astonishment passed over the audience. It was Paganini’s touch, and—it was something more. Some—and they were the majority—thought that never, in his best moments of inspiration, had the"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Italian artist himself, in executing that diabolical composition of his, exhibited such an extraordinary diabolical power. Under the pressure of the long muscular fingers of Franz, the chords shivered like the palpitating intestines of a disembowelled victim under the vivisector’s knife. They moaned melodiously, like a dying child. The large blue eye of the artist, fixed with a satanic expression upon the sounding-board, seemed to summon forth Orpheus himself from the infernal regions, rather than the T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  255 musical n otes supposed to be generated in the depths of the violin. Sounds seemed to transform themselves into objective shapes, thickly and precipitately gathering as at the evocation of a mighty magician, and to be whirling around him, like a host of fantastic, infernal figures, dancing the witches’ “goat dance.” In the empty depths of the shadowy background of the stage, behind the artist, a nameless phantasmagoria, produced by the concussion of unearthly vibrations, seemed to form pictures of shameless orgies, of the voluptuous hymens of a real witches’ Sabbath . . . A collective hallucination took hold of the public. Panting for breath, ghastly, and trickling with the icy perspiration of an inexpressible horror, they sat spellbound, and unable to break the spell of the music by the slightest motion. They experienced all the illicit enervating delights of the paradise of Mahommed, that come into the disordered fancy of an opium-eating Mussulman, and felt at the same time the abject terror, the agony of one who struggles against an attack of delirium tremens . . . Many ladies shrieked aloud, others fainted, and strong men gnashed their teeth in a state of utter helplessness . . . Then came the finale . Thundering uninterrupted applause delayed its beginning, expanding the momentary pause to a duration of almost a quarter of an hour. The bravos were furious, almost hysterical. At last, when after a profound and last bow, Stenio, whose smile was as sardonic as it was triumphant, lifted his bow to attack the famous finale , his eye fell upon Paganini, who, calmly seated in the manager’s box, had been behind none in zealous applause. The small and piercing black eyes of the Genoese artist were riveted to the Stradivarius in the hands of Franz, but otherwise he seemed quite cool and unconcerned. His rival’s face troubled him for one short instant, but he regained his self-possession and, lifting once more his bow, drew the first note. Then the public enthusiasm reached its acme, and soon knew no bounds. The listeners heard and saw indeed. The 256  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS witches’ voices resounded in the air, and beyond all the other voices, one voice was heard—"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Discordant, and unlike to human sounds; It seem’d of dogs the bark, of wolves the howl; The doleful screechings of the midnight owl; The hiss of snakes, the hungry lion’s roar; The sounds of billows beating on the shore; The groan of winds among the leafy wood, And burst of thunder from the rending cloud;— ’Twas these, all these in one . . . The magic bow was drawing forth its last quivering sounds—famous among prodigious musical feats—imitating the precipitate flight of the witches before bright dawn; of the unholy women saturated with the fumes of their nocturnal Saturnalia, when—a strange thing came to pass on the stage. Without the slightest transition, the notes suddenly changed. In their aerial flight of ascension and descent, their melody was unexpectedly altered in character. The sounds became confused, scattered, disconnected . . . and then—it seemed from the sounding-board of the violin—came out squeaking jarring tones, like those of a street Punch, screaming at the top of a senile voice: “Art thou satisfied, Franz, my boy? . . . Have not I gloriously kept my promise, eh?” The spell was broken. Though still unable to realize the whole situation, those who heard the voice and the Punchinello-like tones, were freed, as by enchantment, from the terrible charm under which they had been held. Loud roars of laughter, mocking exclamations of half-anger and half-irritation were now heard from every corner of the vast theatre. The musicians in the orchestra, with faces still blanched from weird emotion, were now seen shaking with laughter, and the whole audience rose, like one man, from their seats, unable yet to solve the enigma; they felt, nevertheless, too disgusted, too disposed to laugh to remain one moment longer in the building. But suddenly the sea of moving heads in the stalls and the T HE E NSOULED V IOLIN  257 pit beca m e once more motionless, and stood petrified as though struck by lightning. What all saw was terrible enough—the handsome though wild face of the young artist suddenly aged, and his graceful, erect figure bent down, as though under the weight of years; but this was nothing to that which some of the most sensitive clearly perceived. Franz Stenio’s person was now entirely enveloped in a semi-transparent mist, cloud-like, creeping with serpentine motion and gradually tightening round the living form, as though ready to engulf him. And there were those also who discerned in this tall and ominous pillar of smoke a clearly-defined figure, a form showing the unmistakable outlines of a grotesque and grinning, but terribly awful-looking old man, whose viscera were protruding and the ends of the intestines stretched on the violin. Within this hazy, quivering veil, the violinist was then seen, driving his bow"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"furiously across the human chords, with the contortions of a demoniac, as we see them represented on mediaeval cathedral paintings! An indescribable panic swept over the audience, and breaking now, for the last time, through the spell which had again bound them motionless, every living creature in the theatre made one mad rush towards the door. It was like the sudden outburst of a dam, a human torrent, roaring amid a shower of discordant notes, idiotic squeakings, prolonged and whining moans, cacophonous cries of frenzy, above which, like the detonations of pistol shots, was heard the consecutive bursting of the four strings stretched upon the sound-board of that bewitched violin. When the theatre was emptied of the last man of the audience, the terrified manager rushed on the stage in search of the unfortunate performer. He was found dead and already stiff, behind the footlights, twisted up into the most unnatural of postures, with the “catguts” wound curiously around his neck, and his violin shattered into a thousand fragments . . . When it became publicly known that the unfortunate would-be rival of Nicolo Paganini had not left a cent to pay for his funeral or his hotel bill, the Genoese, his 258  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS proverbial meanness notwithstanding, settled the hotel-bill and had poor Stenio buried at his own e x pense. He claimed, however, in exchange, the fragments of the Stradivarius—as a memento of the strange event. ———— "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME II 1880 EDITOR’S NOTE TO “SWAMI VERSUS MI SSIONARY” [ The Theosophist , Vol. I, No. 4, January, 1880, p. 100] [Munshi Samarthadan, having given an authentic report of a debate which took place at Ajmere, on November 28th, 1878, between Pandit Dayânanda Saraswatî and the Rev.

The fact forces itself upon the attention of every unprejudiced visitor to India that the Oriental missionary scheme is a wretched failure, and the millions contributed to it by the benevolent are virtually wasted. This appears to be the opinion of most old Anglo-Indians of all ranks. It is intended to publish testimony upon this very important subject in these pages and communications are invited.

B. comments on the article as follows:] We have not been willing to interrupt the rhythmic flow of our correspondent’s languag e with any commentaries of our own, but must add a word of supplement. The outward phase of the idea of nature-worship he has succinctly and eloquently traced. But he, in common with most modern scholars, completely ignores one chief factor. We allude to the experience, once so common among men, now so comparatively rare, of a world of real beings, whose abode is in the four elements, beings with probable though as yet ill-defined powers, and a perceptible existence. We are sorry for those who will pity us for making this admission; but fact is fact, science or no science. The realization of this inner world of the Elementals dates back to the beginning of our race, and has been embalmed in the verse of poets and preserved in the religious and historical records of the world. Granted that the perception of phenomena developed nature-worship, yet, unless our materialistic friends admit that the range of these phenomena included experiences with the spirits of the elements and the higher and noble realities of Psychology, it would trouble them to account for the universality of belief in the various races of the Unseen Universe. Why should but one of the elements, namely, earth, be so densely populated, and fire, water, air, etc., be deemed empty voids, uninhabited by their own beings—the “viewless races,” as the great Bulwer-Lytton called them? Is this 260  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS partiality of nature a logical hypothesis of science? Who that observes the marvellous adaptat i ons of the organs of sense and the natures of beings to their environment, dares say that these elementals do not exist, until he is well assured that the perceptive faculties of our bodies are capable of apprehending all the secret things of this and other worlds? Why may not the spirits of the kingdoms of earth, air, fire and water be non-existent to us—and we to them—only because neither has the organs to see or feel the other?

The writer, one of the most estimable ladies in India, is wife of Lt.-Col. William Gordon, F.T.S., Staff Corps, District Superintendent of Police, Mânbhûm, Bengal. A recent letter of hers to The Pioneer , upon the subject of Spiritualism, occasioned a very active discussion; and since she now expresses the opinion of all Anglo-Indians as regards missionary work in India, it is probable that the public will be favored with a much needed ventilation of a gross abuse of long standing. A false delicacy has hitherto prevented this matter from being gone into as its importance deserves. It is a pity to see so many sacrifices made by good people in the West merely to support a party of inefficients in the profitless because hopeless occupation of trying to persuade the people of India and other Asiatic countries to relinquish their ancestral faith for one which the missionaries are utterly unable to defend when questioned by even tolerably educated “heathen.” The money is sorely needed at home to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and rescue the vicious from their state of lawlessness and degradation.

But, though an American citizen, and entirely d i v o r c e d from Russia’s paternal sway over my own person, besides being a born Russian, I am yet one of those who, by the very combativeness of their nature, feel compelled to give even “the devil his due,” though the devil be the Muscovite Government, whenever unjustly attacked. And the imputation of the Economist as to the hopeless position of the “Armenian under St. Petersburg” is as unjust as it is foolish, liable, as it is, to such an easy refutation. Surely the Editor of the London Magazine, who has allowed this remark to be published, must either have forgotten, or never knew, the fact that the late Commander-in-Chief of the expeditionary army now in Central Asia was an “Armenian”; that General Tergukasoff, one of the heroes of the late war in Asiatic Turkey, and who has just replaced the defunct Lazareff, is an “Armenian”; that General Loris-Melikoff, just created a “count” for valiant service in Kars and elsewhere, is another “Armenian,” without one drop of European blood in any of them; that the army, as well as the Civil Service in the Caucasus, have been from the first days of Russia’s sway over the country full of Armenian, Georgian, and even Mussulman colonels, generals, commanders, and other high Government officials; that the greatest Caucasian heroes were nearly all either Armenians, Georgians, or Tatars, such as the Prince Bebutoff (who acted during the Crimean War as Viceroy in the Caucasus), the several Melikoffs, the Tarhanoffs, the Orbeliani, the Bagrations, the Chan Adil’-Guirey, and so many others, that finally, in the “Mohammedan regiments,” out of which the"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"splendid body of men known as the “Czar’s Mussulman Bodyguard” is chosen, from the lowest soldier up to the highest General, they are all Mohammedans.

Lieutenant-General Arzas Artelyevich Tergukasoff (1819-81) was in 1859 Commander of the Apsheron Infantry Regiment; he took part in the storming of Gunib; in 1868, he administered the Province of Tersk; in 1869, he commanded the 38th Infantry Division. At the start of the Turkish war, he was appointed Commander of the Erivan’ contingent; in 1877, he occupied Bajaset and Alashkert, and in 1879 was appointed Commander of the 2nd Caucasian Corps. The Bebutoffs were a Princely family descended from Ashhar-Bek, an Armenian who was melik or city-commandant of Tiflis in the reign of the Georgian King Teymuraz II. Prince Vassiliy Ossipovich Bebutoff (1791-1858) was General of Infantry, Member of the State Council and a well-known military and civil figure. The Princes Tarhanoff-Muravyeff were an Armenian family descended from a certain Saakadze (meaning “son of Isaac”). The Shah of Persia granted George Saakadze a princely title and a hereditary tarhanship ; the latter is a Mongolian word which means free from taxation, of noble birth, as well as, artist and man skilled in some trade. One of the members of this family was Ivan Romanovich Tarhanoff, a well-known Russian physiologist of the 19th century. The Princes Orbeliani, or Djambakurian-Orbelian, were of a princely family which, according to tradition, came from China and settled in Georgia some 600 years B.C . They became hereditary command e rs-in-chief of the Georgian armed forces, and placed the crown on the head of the Kings during coronation ceremonies. Prince George Dimitriyevich Orbeliani (1800-83) was a General-of-Infantry and member of the State Council. The Princes Bagration were one of the oldest and most renowned families of Georgia, which produced through the centuries several of the Armenian and Georgian Kings. It originated from Athanasius Bagratid, whose son, Ashod Kuropalat (d. 826), was King of Georgia. Adil’-Guirey ruled over the tribe of the Kumiks and became in 1718 a subject of Russia. When he had become Shamhal of Tarkov, he transferred his possessions to Russia. Later on, however, urged by the Turks to do so, he attacked Russia in 1725; he was annihilated by Kropotoff, and died in prison at Kola. ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"266  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS The Laza reff mentioned by H.P.B. is most likely Lieutenant-General Ivan Danilovich (1821-79), a descendant from the beks of Karabag; he was very active during the Turkish war of 1877-78. Count Michael Tarielovich Loris-Melikoff (1826-88) was the son of an Armenian merchant; he was born at Tiflis, Caucasus, on Jan. 1st, 1826, and educated in St. Petersburg, first in the Lazareff School of Oriental Languages, and later in the Guard’s Cadet Institute. After joining a Hussar regiment, he was sent in 1847 to the Caucasus, where he stayed for twenty years. From 1855 to 1876, he was Governor of the Terek district, endeavoring to educate the people, so as to make possible the transition from military to civil government. During the Turkish war of 1877-78, he commanded a separate army corps in Asia Minor. He took the fortresses of Ardahan and Kars, and laid seige to Erzerum. He was granted the title of Count for these services. In 1879 he was appointed temporary governor-general of the Lower Volga region, to combat an outbreak of the plague. He was later transferred to the provinces of Central Russia to combat the Nihilists and Anarchists, who had assassinated the governor of Kharkov. Loris-Melikoff advocated removing the causes of the growing popular discontent, and for this purpose recommended to Emperor Alexander II a large scheme of administrative and economic reforms. The Emperor appointed him minister of the interior with exceptional powers. The proposed scheme of reforms was, however, never carried out. On the very day, March 13, 1881, when the Emperor signed an ukaz creating the necessary commissions, he was assassinated, and his successor, Alexander III, adopted a reactionary policy.

The free-thinkers and infidels, like a swarm of wicked mosquitoes buzzing around, worry them worse than ever. Their Roman Catholic brothers played, and are still preparing to play, all manner of unholy tricks upon them, and though the abuse lavished upon the heads of these pious and meek Christians, was mutual—especially when brought under the public notice in the shape of pamphlets issued by the Bible Society—yet it was anything but edifying and offered some impediments to future conversions. For years they have drawn, we may say, no other converts in India but those who go more for ready cash or money’s worth, than holy grace; and they feel, do these good men of God, that for the average Christian to stand by and see these “heathen brands plucked from the burning,” flying from the Catholic sanctuary unto the tabernacle of the Protestant Lord, and vice versa , according to the fluctuations of the market, was as good as a game of shuttlecock and battledore. And now the rumblings of 1880 are beginning to be heard. Amanda Smith, the mother pilgrim from the land of the Pilgrim Fathers, proved, outside the small community of the true believers—a failure. Even their best, and, as 268  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS I believe, their only undeteriorated specimen of native preacher, the hitherto indefat i gable Parsee convert, begins to show unmistakable signs of weariness and the blackest melancholy. This illustrious Zoroastrian, who used, with the punctuality of a timepiece and—as if in derision of his former god—just before sunset, to daily squeeze himself among the bas-reliefs of the Dhobi Talav fountain, was missed at his usual place for several afternoons. The spot from which he lifted up his voice—as one conscious of crying in the wilderness—was actually deserted for several days! Wicked tongues report him becoming hoarse; he looks ill, they say, hence, perhaps his slackening zeal. And yet, if he loses it altogether—the voice, I mean, not his zeal—perchance his always scant now absent audiences may return all the sooner.

His was not the voice to make the water-buffalo to desist from grazing, or the buggy-wallah cease plying the persuasive stick. It was evidently a neglected organ and the padris might do worse than insist upon his taking a few lessons in singing—were it but from the ebony-browed nightingale newly landed from America—before further compromising their cause by allowing him to sing the average heathen to the verge of suicide. No less inimical than the unregenerate infidels, the Roman Catholic rivals, and the unmusical convert, becomes public opinion as regards the padris. The tide recedes, and the milk of kindness hitherto so freely drawn by them from the full udder of the nursing mother church of the “innocents at home,” is evidently curdling and turning sour.

Their first, and as yet tottering steps upon treading the shores of the land of the sacred cow and the starving bullock, were crossed by “poor” missionaries driving in fashionable dogcarts, or reclining in elegant victorias with a red-garbed and skeleton-legged heathen sais or two hanging on behind, like two large clots of blood. . . . Then came several violent raps upon the “poor missionary’s” knuckles from earnest correspondents, writing in respectable orthodox London papers, besides daily attacks published by a hundred freethinking, though not less respectable daily journals throughout Christendom as well as in Heathendom. So, for instance, there appeared some time ago a savage attack upon these inoffensive, and well-meaning men, which requires notice. They were asked to first turn their attention to other and more needy directions than the lands of the “heathen.” Speaking of the enormous sums annually spent on foreign missions, a writer, signing himself Pilot , in a letter addressed to the Weekly Times (London, Aug. 31st, 1879), is struck with “the anomaly which continually presents itself to the most casual observer. . . . While the Kaffir, the Heathen Chinese, the mild Hindu, the poor African, and the Australian aboriginal” come in, every one of them, for their due share of physical and religious attention, “there comes case upon case before public tribunals, showing the lamentable ignorance of the dregs of our own population” . . . We quote the rest of the letter: In one recent instance, a girl of fourteen was questioned by the magistrate as to the Bible , a boo k which she declared she had never before heard mentioned.

It is nothing less than a hypocritical farce to spend money on proselytizing cannibals , when we have brother and sister heathen at our very doors . Charity should begin at home; but there evidently is not the same glory to be won rescuing an English waif in the purlieus of Ratcliff-highway as there is in converting a stray nigger in the wilds of Africa. And now, as the last coup de grâce after this impertinence from home, comes in a stern re b uke in a highly respectable and strictly orthodox organ. This once it is neither an “infidel pigmy” like The Theosophist (the latest epithet bestowed upon it by a missionary organ, which, though famous for our great kindness, we must abstain from advertising) nor a second-class paper of London, which “goes for” the padris, but that great authoritative organ of India and, as we are told, true barometer of the Indian press, which—to use a French expression—“makes the rain and the sunshine,” and tunes the violins of all minor papers— The Pioneer , in short. The rebuke, though indirect, and aimed rather at the collective body of missions than at the Indian in particular, must be very hard to bear. We sympathise heartily with the padris; and were not The Pioneer such a Goliath of the journalistic Gath, perchance the Quixotic spirit of our suckling David, this “infidel pigmy,” might even be aroused in defence of the poor missionary.

Since the destruction of the pagan temples and after an interval of several centuries, it was practiced and taught by Paracelsus, the great mystic and one of the sect of the “fire-philosophers.” Among these this force was known under the various names of “living fire,” the “Spirit of light,” etc.; the Pythagoreans called it the “Soul of the world” ( anima mundi ), and the Alchemists, “ magnes ,” and the “Celestial Virgin.” About the middle of the 18th century, Max Hell, Professor of Astronomy at Vienna, and a friend of Dr. F. Anthony Mesmer, advised him to try whether, like another Paracelsus and Kircher, he could not cure diseases with the magnet. Mesmer improved upon the idea and ended in performing the most miraculous cures—no more by mineral, but, as he claimed, by animal magnetism. In 1778 Mesmer went to Paris; caused in this city the greatest excitement, and from the first, firmly mastered public opinion. He"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"would not, however, give his secret to the government, but instead of that formed a class, and nearly 4,000 persons studied under his directions at various times; Lafayette, the Marquis de Puységur, and the famous Dr. Charles d’Eslon being his pupils. His methods were not those of the present day, but he treated his patients by placing magnets on various parts of their bodies, or by having them sit round a covered tub from the cover of which an iron rod went out to each person, the whole party thus being connected by touching hands. He also made passes with his hands over their bodies. While Mesmer, provoking in the body and limbs of the sick persons a cold prickling sensation, nervous twitchings, drowsiness, sleep, and procuring thereby an alleviation and often a total cure, did not go further than to cure nervous diseases, it was the Marquis de Puységur, his pupil, who discovered somnambulism—the most important result of animal magnetism. And it was Deleuze, the famous naturalist of the Jardin des Plantes, a 276  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS man greatly respected for his probity and as an author, who published in 1813 a Critical H i s t o r y o f Animal Magnetism . * At this time, notwithstanding its evident success and benefit, mesmerism had nearly lost ground. In 1784, the French Government had ordered the Medical Faculty of Paris to make an enquiry into Mesmer’s practices and theory, and report. A commission was appointed of such men as the American Philosopher Franklin, Lavoisier, Bailly, and others. But, as Mesmer refused to deliver his secret and make it public, the result was that having carefully investigated the mode of treatment, the report admitted that a great influence was wrought upon the subjects, but this influence was ascribed by them chiefly to imagination ! The impression left thereby on the public mind was that Mesmer was a charlatan, and his pupils—dupes. Notwithstanding the general prejudice, magnetism throve and got known over the whole world. It had made an invasion upon the grounds of medical routine and fought its way step by step. It appealed from the stubborn hostility of the Academy and the old traditions of its members to the judgment of the multitude, promising to abide by the decree of the majority. “It was in vain that its friends were treated as charlatans by the medical faculty and the majority of the learned,” writes Deleuze; “the man, who had witnessed mesmeric experiments among his friends, would believe despite all the authority which could be brought to bear upon him.” At last, in 1825, owing to the efforts of Dr. P. F. Foissac, a young physician of note and an enthusiastic admirer of Mesmer, the Royal Academy of Medicine in Paris appointed another learned commission and had a serious investigation made. Would anyone believe it? Owing to numerous intrigues, the opinion of the learned investigators was withheld for over five years; and it was only in 1831, that the report was rendered, and then found to the great discomfiture of the old academical and mouldy –––––––––– * [The work which is meant here is Histoire c r itique du megnétisme animal , by Jean Philippe François Deleuze (Paris: Mame, 1813. 2 Vols. 8vo.). —Compiler .]"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"–––––––––– A G REAT L IGHT U NDER A B USHEL  277 brains t o contain a unanimous decision to the following effect: It was reported that— (1) Mesmerism is a force capable of exercising a powerful influence on the human system; (2) that this influence does not depend upon imagination ; (3) that it does not act with equal force on all persons, and upon some is entirely powerless; (4) that it produces somnambulic sleep; (5) that in this sleep injury to the nerves of sensation does not cause the slightest sense of pain; (6) that the sleeper can hear no sound save the voice of the magnetizer; (7) that the sleeper’s nerves of touch and smell carry no sensation to the brain, unless excited by the magnetizer; (8) that some sleepers can see with their eyes closed, can foretell accurately , even months in advance (as was amply proved) various events, and especially the time of the return of epileptic fits, their cure, and discover the diseases of persons with whom they are placed in magnetic connection; and that persons suffering with weakness, pains, epilepsy, and paralysis, were partially or entirely cured by magnetic treatment. The report created the greatest sensation. Mesmerism extended all over the world. Students of the new science became more numerous than ever, the ablest writers kept track of its progress and high among all others as a mesmerizer and a writer stood Baron J. D. Du Potet.* About the year 1840, Baron Karl von Reichenbach, an eminent German chemist, and the discoverer of creosote, discovered a new force, fluid, or principle—which we regard rather as one of the correlations of the Anima Mundi— which he called od or odyle .

He called the process hypnotism and gave to his theory the graceful name of neurypnology , setting it down as a mesmeric antidote. Such is, in brief, the history of this wonderful principle in nature; a principle, as little understood as were electricity and galvanism in days of old. And yet while the latter, as soon as demonstrated, were unanimously accepted and even greeted, the former, however great its claims for alleviating the pains of suffering humanity, however much demonstrated, is today as bitterly denied and decried as it was in the days of Mesmer. Shall we say why? Because, while electricity and galvanism in their practical application by, and meaning in, science are the gross manifestations of the universal Proteus, the great Anima Mundi— Magnetism, in its broadest and most mysterious sense, discovers beyond mere physical results horizons so mysterious and vast, that the matter of fact and sceptical scientists stagger and repulse its spiritual possibilities with all the might of their narrow-minded materialism. Once that they admit its existence and give it rights of citizenship, the whole of their schools will have to be remodelled. On the other hand, the clergy are as bitter against it, for its results, in their beneficent effects, upset every necessity for believing in divine “miracles,” or fearing the diabolical, and give the lie direct to their old slanders. We will now show the progress of magnetism under its various modern names of mesmerism, magnetism, hypnotism, and other isms , among the men of science, and mesmerizers who explain it, each in his own way. –––––––––– * [Reichenbach, Researc h es on Magnetism .

We mean to cut off every possible retreat for the enemy, and will, therefore, strictly hold but to the personal experiments and explanations of some of the recognized leaders of medicine. One such is Monsieur Naquet, deputy of Vaucluse, Professor of the Faculty of Medicine at Paris, and author of Ancient and Modern Revelations . * This gentleman, who is a hard-shelled materialist, to whom the mere idea of soul in man is as unwelcome as the smell of incense used to be to the traditional devil, is just now giving a series of scientific lectures in Paris, the main object of which seems to be to admit the phenomena of mesmerism (at last!) and—fight against the theory of the human soul having anything to do with them. Having successfully pulled out the props from under the ancient revelation, i . e ., the Bible—and demonstrated the absurdity of belief in the modern"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Catholic “miracles” of Lourdes and Salette—against which position we will not protest—he tries his hand at Spiritualism and Mesmerism. Unfortunately for the able lecturer he seems to labour under the impression that the votaries of both spirit intercourse and Mesmer must necessarily believe in Supernaturalism—hence miracles . Of course, he makes a mess of it. We quote, translating portions of his lectures verbatim : Hand in hand with these persons (the spiritualists) who bring forward such weak arguments, we find moving, n evertheless, a few others (mesmerizers) whose ideas deserve to be taken into consideration and discussed. These pretend [?] to produce at will in some human beings a peculiar kind of sleep, called the magnetic. They affirm their ability to communicate to certain subjects the faculty of seeing through opaque bodies, and they maintain that such facts remain inexplainable unless we admit the existence of a soul in man. –––––––––– * Révélation Antique et Révélation Moderne . –––––– – ––– 280  B LAVAT SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS To begin with: are the facts from which these men draw their conclusions at all certain?* Admitting that they are, cannot they be explained upon any other hypothesis than the existence of this Soul? The facts under consideration are affirmed by enlightened and honourable men; thus, in this case, they do not offer that startling character of imbecility and imposture which constitutes the fundamental feature of Spiritualism .† Therefore, I will not immediately pronounce upon the unreality of all they tell us of magnetism; but, at the same time I propose to show that these facts, however real, do not in the least prove any necessity for the intervention of a soul to account for them. Magnetic sleep can be explained quite naturally. The phenomena of electric attraction daily produced before our very eyes, and which no one ever attempted to attribute to a supernatural cause, are at least as extraordinary as the mesmeric influence of one man upon another man. For the last several years, sleep, followed by complete insensibility and identical in all points with the magnetic sleep, is produced by purely mechanical means. To obtain it, one has but to approach a light to the patient’s nose. The fixing of his eyes upon the luminous point produces a cerebral fatigue which results in sleep. At this day, it is no longer to be doubted that magnetism belongs to a phenomenon of the same kind, light being replaced by other agents and expedients which bring on the same cerebral fatigue, and finally sleep. Lucidity seems more doubtful than simple magnetic sleep, and it becomes still more difficult to give it credence. Admitting it to be demonstrated, however, we could again explain it without meddling with the Spirit . We will know that light and heat are but vibratory motions; that light and heat differ but in the length of their undulations; that these undulations which are perceptible to our eye, are of various lengths, producing in us the sensation of various colours; that moreover among the undulatory motions, which we recognize as heat, there are waves of different lengths; that there exists, in short, such a thing as a real calorific spectrum . On the other hand, as, beyond the red ray, there are motions which remain unperceivable by the eye, but which become sensible to the touch as heat, so there are others beyond the violet ray, which develop in us neither impressions of heat nor those of –––––––––– *At the time of this lecture the eminent physician believed but little in the mesmeric phenomena.

Finally, experiment shows to us that there are bodies permeable to heat, yet perfectly impermeable to light, and vice versa . Thus, we can admit the production of vibrations or waves of various lengths and infinitely variable. But of all such possible motions there is but a certain number only, within very restricted limits, that are perceived by us as light, heat, or chemical rays. All greater and smaller motions escape our senses, as would the luminous motions, had we no organ of sight. They escape us simply because we have no organs fit to perceive them. Let us now suppose that, owing to a nervous sur-excitement, our organs may become impressionable to the extra-calorific or extra-luminous rays. THE FACTS OF MAGNETIC LUCIDITY WOULD BE PERFECTLY EXPLAINED. We thank modern Science for teaching us such truths and explaining such a profoun d ly involved problem. But we can hardly refrain from reminding the erudite lecturer that he but repeats that which was explained by nearly every ancient philosopher and repeated by many a modern writer, who has treated upon clairvoyance. The Neo-Platonists explained clairvoyance on the same principle; Baptiste van Helmont in his Opera Omnia , A.D . 1652 (p. 720), treats this second sight in the realm of the occu l t universe most elaborately. The Hindu Yogi reaches clairvoyance by purely physiological processes, which does not prevent him from often discerning things real , not imaginary . “Light, heat, and chemical rays,” our wise lecturer goes on to say, “are propagated by means of vibrations, and according to the same law; thus, must it be for the rays which remain imperceptible to our senses. Let only our eyes become fit for perceiving them, and the ‘double sight’ has nothing in it to surprise us. . . . The day when these facts (of mesmerism) shall be sufficiently proved , our hypothesis will become more acceptable than that of the soul . It will allow of every explanation , without trespassing beyond the laws which govern the universe .” We make haste to deny and emphatically protest against the imputation of believing in the supernatural. The hypothesis of Monsieur Naquet, the physiologist, if ever 282  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS accepted, beyond the small minority of his colleagues, will never prove “acceptable.” As t o a c c u s i ng, as he does, the vast body of Spiritualists, Spiritists, and Mesmerists of trespassing in their explanation beyond the laws which govern the universe , it is as false as it is ridiculous. Once more it shows how apt are our opponents, and especially physiologists, to disfigure facts whenever these clash with their ideas. Their arguments"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"were unique. If, said they, artificial sleep can be produced by purely mechanical means (hypnotism), what use is there in calling spirit and soul to our help to explain this phenomenon? No use whatever, indeed. But neither did we ever pretend to explain this preliminary stage to clairvoyance-sleep whether natural, hypnotic, or mesmeric, by any soul or spirit theory. This imputation lies only in the case of uneducated Spiritualists, who attribute all such phenomena to “disembodied spirits.” But can they themselves—these high priests of intellect—the agency of the spiritual ego being put aside—any more rationally explain the phenomenon of somnambulism, clairvoyance (which some of them as we see are forced to admit) or even sleep and simple dreams, than we, not “scientifically trained” mortals? Even ordinary sleep with its infinite modifications is as good as unknown to physiology. Admitting even that the will of man is not the direct cause of magnetic effects, it yet, as Monsieur Donato, the celebrated magnetizer of Paris, remarks, “plays upon and guides many a mysterious force in nature, the mere existence of which is totally unknown to science.” D R . C HARCOT OF P ARIS ( T he Illustrious Discoverer of the “ H y s t e r i cal Cock ”) Meanwhile science fishes in the same water with the mesmerizers and for the same fish—only inventing for it, when caught, a new, and as it thinks, a more scientific name. The above accusation is easily demonstrated. As a proof, we may cite the case of Dr. Charcot. It is the same great Parisian professor who, having proved to his own satisfaction that no mesmeric effects can be obtained with A G REAT L IGHT U NDER A B USHEL 283 a subj e ct unless this subject be naturally hysterical, mesmerized a rooster and thus became the original discoverer of the “Hysterical Cock.”* Professor Charcot is an authority upon all manner of nervous diseases, a high rival of Broca, Vulpian, Luys, etc., and besides being the celebrated physician of the hospitals of Paris, is a member of the Academy of Medicine. Like the less scientific but equally famous Dr. W. A. Hammond, of New York, he believes in the efficacy of the metallic discs of Dr. Bürck for curing more than one incurable disease, but unlike that neurologist, does not attribute any of either the cures or other phenomena to imagination; for catalepsy can be practiced upon animals, according to his own experiments. He also gives credit in his own way to the genuineness of somnambulism and the freaks of catalepsy, attributing to the latter all mediumistic phenomena. On the authority of a correspondent of Mr. Ragazzi, the Editor of the Journal du Magnétisme of Geneva, he proceeds in the following fashion: Dr. Charcot first introduces to his audience at the hospital of La Salpêtrière (Paris) a sick girl in a state of perfect insensibility. Pins and needles are stuck in her head and body without the least effect. An application of a collar of zinc discs for five minutes returns life into the regions of the throat. Then the two poles of a horseshoe magnet are"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"applied to her left arm and that spot exhibits sensibility, while the rest of the body remains in its previous state. The same magnet, placed in contact with the leg, instead of bringing the limb back to life, produces a violent contraction of the foot, drawing the toes to the heel; it ceases but upon an application of electricity. “These experiments of metallotherapia and mineral magnetism remind one of the gropings of Mesmer in 1774, and of his applications of magnetized pieces in the case of nervous diseases,” says Mr. Pony, the medical student, in his letter to the Journal du Magnétisme , and an eye-witness. Another subject is brought. She is hysterical like the first –––––––––– * See Revue Magnétique for Feb r uary, 1879, edited by Donato at Paris. –––––––––– 284  B LAVAT SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS one, and appears in a state of complete anaesthesia. A strong ray of electric light is directe d on her, and the patient is instantaneously cataleptized. She is made to assume the most unnatural positions; and, according to the attitude commanded , have her countenance “by suggestion,” says Dr. Charcot, “express that which her gestures imply. Thus her hands, crossed on her bosom, are followed by an expression of ecstasy on her face; her arms, stretched forward, produce in her features an air of supplication. . . .” If, while the subject is in this state, the luminous ray is abruptly withdrawn, the patient collapses and falls again into somnambulism— a word which shocks Professor Charcot beyond description. At the command of the physician, and while he proves her utter insensibility by sticking pins in every portion of her body, the patient is made to obey the doctor at every word of command. He forces her to rise, to walk, to write, etc. In a letter from Mr. Aksakoff, which is published further on, it will be seen that Donato, the professional magnetizer produces by will power all that is produced by the sceptical savant by electricity and mechanical means. Does the latter experiment prove that mesmerism is but a name? Can we not, rather, see in both a mutual corroboration; a proof, moreover, of the presence in man’s system of all those subtle powers of nature, the grosser manifestations of which are only known to us as electricity and magnetism, and the finer escaping entirely the scrutiny of physical science? But one of the most curious features of the phenomenon, brought on by Dr. Charcot’s experiments, is to be found in the effect produced on his patients by vibrations like those felt on a railway train. Upon perceiving it, the illustrious professor had a huge diapason, 40 centimeters high, placed upon a large chest. As soon as this instrument is made to vibrate, the patients at once fall into catalepsy; and whenever the vibrations are abruptly stopped, the patients sink into complete somnambulism. It would seem, then, that Dr. Charcot, in order to produce the above described effects, uses but two agents— sound and light . Thus, this assurance may become of an"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"A G REAT L IGHT U NDER A B USHEL  285 immense im portance to all the Aryan students of Theosophy, especially to those who study the Sanskrit, and who, thanks to Swami Dayanand, are now enabled to learn the real and spiritual meaning of certain disputed words.

In considering the phenomena produced by Dr. Charcot, the cold materialist and man of science, it is highly interesting to read a letter on his own personal experiences in magnetism, with the famous magnetizer, Mr. Donato, of Paris, by Alexandre Aksakoff, F.T.S., Russian Imperial Councillor, which was recently addressed by him to a French journal. The results obtained are all the more worthy of notice from the fact that Mr. Donato had not previously attempted the so-called “transmission of thought” from one person to another by the mere will of the magnetizer and –––––––––– * Translated by Professor Max Müller as “gold,” whereas it really means “divine light,” in the exact s e n s e u n d erstood by the mediaeval alchemists.

As to Aksakoff, he is a highly intelligent and truthful"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"gentleman; reputed to be, in his earnest researches in the domain of magnetism and psychology not only a cautious investigator, but rather of a too distrustful nature. We here give the verbatim translation of his article published by him in La Revue Magnétique , of February, 1879. M ONSIEUR D ONATO AND M LLE . L UCILE : E XPERIENCES IN “T HOUGHT T RANSMISSION .” Having had the pleasure of making, at Paris, the acquaintance of Mr. Donato and of his amiable and excellent p upil, I did not wish to lose the opportunity of attempting an experiment, under my own direction, to ascertain the possibility of transmitting thought from one human being to another by the vehicle of the will alone. It is known that one of the most ordinary aphorisms of modern psychology is: “Psychological activity cannot go beyond the periphery of the nerves.” If then it can be proved that human thought is not limited to the domain of the body, but that it can act at a distance upon another human body, transmit itself to another brain without visible and recognised communication, and be reproduced by word, movement, or any other means, we obtain an immense fact before which material physiology should bow down, and which should be seized by psychology and philosophy to give a new support and a new development to their metaphysical speculations. This fact has in many ways and under many forms been proved by animal magnetism; but in the experiments which I planned, I wished to see it presented in a form at once convincing and easy to reproduce by any person acquainted with magnetism. When I asked Mr. Donato if he would accord me a private interview for certain experiments which I had in view, he consented willingly A G REAT L IGH T U NDER A B USHEL  287 and promised to hold himself at my service for the day and hour I should indicate. So, having announced myself b y a telegram, I went to his house on the 17th of November at two o’clock, and after a few minutes’ conversation, we began our work. First experiment . — I begged Mr. Donato to commence by putting to sleep his subject, Mlle. Lucile, and he at once placed an armchair between the two windows of the room and a few paces from the wall; in it Mlle. Lucile seated herself, and slept (magnetically) in a few moments. We took our places at the other end of the room, opposite the sleeper, and I then drew from my pocket a card-case from which I took a card and handed it to Mr. Donato, begging him, simply by looking at Mlle. Lucile, to induce her to make the movement indicated on the card. On it was written “Extend the left arm.” Mr. Donato rose, remained motionless near me, and looked at Mlle. Lucile; after an instant her left arm began to move, slowly extended itself, and remained in that position until Mr. Donato replaced it by her side. Second experiment .—I passed to Mr. Donato a white handkerchief which I had brought with me, and begged him to cover with it the face and head of Mlle. Lucile. This being done, and the edges of the handkerchief falling on her shoulders, we took our places again, and in silence I gave to Mr. Donato a second card on which was written, “Raise the right arm vertically.” Mr. Donato fixed his eyes on the motionless body of Mlle. Lucile and soon her right arm, obedient to the thought which directed it, executed the movement indicated—slowly, gently, stopping always when Mr. Donato turned his head to look at me. I felicitated him on his success and begged him that all danger of overfatigue might be avoided, to remove the handkerchief and awake Mlle. Lucile. Third experiment .—After ten minutes of conversation, Mlle. Lucile is again asleep, and her head covered by the handkerchief; we resume our places, and I pass to Mr. Donato a third card bearing the"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"words, “Put both hands upon your head,” and I asked Mr. Donato to stand this time behind Mlle. Lucile. He expresses some doubt as to the possibility of success in this position, but makes the attempt and fails; a fact which did not surprise me, as the polaric connection between the operator and his subject was reversed. At this moment I approached Mr. Donato and a remarkable phenomenon was produced. As I wished to ask the magnetizer to concentrate his will on the occiput of the sleeper, my hand made an involuntary movement towards her back to indicate the place named, and while it was still some inches distant, Mlle. Lucile moved suddenly forward. Thus I obtained in an unexpected and conclusive manner the confirmation of the phenomenon of polarity, or of attraction and repulsion, which I had already observed at the public representations, and which proves very clearly that the sleep of Mlle. Lucile was neither natural nor feigned. “If you will allow me to use my hands,” said Mr. Donato, “I am sure to succeed.” TEOTIHUACÁN, MEXICO—PYRAMID OF THE SUN (From Eugen Kusch, Mexiko im Bild, 1967.

Lucile still remaining asleep with her head under the handkerchief, I give to Mr. Donato a card on which was written, “Join the hands as if praying,” and I place myself on a sofa to the left of Mlle. Lucile, the better to observe the movements of Mr. Donato. He remains motionless at five or six paces from her and looks at her fixedly; her hands take the desired position and retain it until Mr. Donato removes the handkerchief and awakes her. Fifth experiment .—After ten minutes’ rest, Mlle. Lucile goes back to the arm-chair and is again put to sleep. The fifth card orders her to make a knot with the handkerchief, and Mr. Donato, placing himself behind Mlle. Lucile, extends his hand over her head without touching her. She rises and he directs her by his thought towards the table on which the handkerchief has, unknown to her, been placed. Obeying the attraction of the hand, she reaches the table, Mr. Donato still keeping the same position behind her, and I standing near him. With growing interest we watch her movements, and see her hand seize the handkerchief, draw out one of its ends, and tie a knot. Mr. Donato himself was astonished, for this time it was no longer a simple exercise of will, but a thought transmitted and executed! Sixth and last experiment .—It was almost useless to continue, but as Mr. Donato insisted, I handed him another card with the following inscription, “Touch your left car with your right hand.” Mlle. Lucile still asleep was already back in her arm-chair; Mr. Donato stood in front of her, and I occupied my former place on the sofa. Motionless and silent, the magnetizer looked at his subject, whose right arm soon executed the order given, by three successive movements, the hand approaching the breast, and then the ear, which it finally touched. These experiments were for me perfectly conclusive; Mlle. Lucile executed the movements desired without the least hesitation. The thoughts that Mr. Donato was to transmit to her were indicated to him by me only by cards prepared in advance, and in most cases he acted on her from a distance which rendered any conventional sign or signal difficult, even if her face had not been covered with a handkerchief, which I had ascertained was thick enough to hide from her any slight sign given by the hands or face of Mr. Donato; besides which it would have required a very complicated system of minute telegraphy to indicate the movements required. I asked Mr. Donato if he had ever attempted to produce anything of the kind in public, and he answered that these experiments exacted very harmonious conditions, difficult to obtain in large assemblies, and that he did not like to risk a failure. I think if Mr. Donato would exercise his pupil oftener in this direction, he would finish by producing a series of public phenomena of this kind with the same ease A G REAT L IGHT U NDER A B USHEL  289 with which he produces the others.

Did any magazine ever before exhibit a more perfect and fraternal “Evangelical Alliance” than this? ———— The work we have to do in India might be so much impeded by foolish misconceptions that we heartily welcome any additional evidence showing that the public authorities are now alive to the true character of our undertaking. It has already been announced in these columns that the Political Department of the Government of India, from which the order to place our party under Police surveillance first originated, some time ago rescinded that order and announced that the Theosophists were no longer to be molested. This was all the amende honorable that could be made in a matter which pertained to the confidential branch of the service and had never found a place in the Gazette . It is pleasant to feel that the groundless, and in view of our antecedents absurd, notion that some political designs lay hidden under our intimacy with the natives and our desire to give a new impulse to the study of Oriental philosophy, has already been dissipated by the progress of time. Our friends will be additionally glad to hear that without the necessity for the slightest sacrifice of self-respect on our part, the last shade of misunderstanding on the part of Government has been cleared away. Those who know us at 292  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS all need not be told that there is no association in the world which builds its hope of success o n Government favour, less than the Theosophical Society. Our business is with truth and philosophy, not with politics or administration. But the conditions of life in India are such that the modicum of Government favour which consists of freedom from the blighting effects of active disfavor, is essential to the success of even a purely intellectual movement. It is satisfactory to realize that we now receive—as we are"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"certainly entitled to receive—that much support from the rulers of this country to whose spiritual interests we have devoted our lives. And now that this support has been liberally granted, we cannot be misunderstood if we add that there is no organization in this land on which the British Government in India could look kindly with better reason than our own. As an independent link between two races which the Government expresses a wish to see united in closer intimacy, as a society which is sternly intolerant of seditious efforts of any kind among its members — we have already done better service to the cause of public order in this country, than its rulers are aware of having received at our hands. But so the fact stands, and thus it is that we receive, with the full satisfaction attending a conviction that we deserve it, the kindly though cautious greeting conveyed in the following letter from the Personal Assistant of the Viceroy, in acknowledgement of the receipt of the first three numbers of The Theosophist , forwarded by the conductor of this journal for his Excellency’s perusal : C ALCUTTA , 1st January , 1880.

This is extremely liberal; about as much so as for a Manchester man to concede that the British Empire is an auxiliary branch of the county of Lancashire. When it can be shown that a part of anything can contain its whole, that the tail can wag the dog, or that the ocean can be put into a gallon measure, then it will be time to seriously debate the novel proposition put forth by the respectable metropolitan organ of the Spiritualists.

Some twen t y years ago, as a warning, there was exhibited in triumphant procession all over India, Nâna-Sâhib, locked in an iron cage, delivered for that purpose by his cousin, the Mahârâja of Gwalior. Very proud of this acquisition they showed him almost continuously for all of six weeks, and they only stopped doing so when inquiries proved that the captive was not the bloodthirsty avenger, but merely a pseudo Nâna-Sâhib, some unfortunate shepherd. What they did with this miserable man remains unknown. It is said that in order to clear their conscience, they killed him so that he could not talk. How the 294  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Mahârâja extricated himself from this predicament and what sort of an explanation he g a v e f o r t h is clever hoax is hidden to this day in obscurity. It is said, however, that he justified himself by stating he had never seen the captive himself, but relying on the word of his subordinates, sent the captive straight to the English. At present, there is in Madras a new exhibit of a rebel but not a live one. The curious populace can see, pickled in alcohol, the head of Chendry—the famous rebel leader of Rumla. For over a year, without any material resources, and with a handful of men armed with obsolete weapons, this Chendry successfully fought the armed forces of one of the most powerful nations of the globe. He entered a very dangerous arena, declaring in advance that if necessary he was determined to sacrifice his own life and that of his family, and he kept his word. The Daily Amrita -Bazaar-Patrika , representing the native opp o sition party in Calcutta and all the malcontents of India, declares Chendry a hero, placing him incomparably higher than Phadke, another leader of the rebels, recently exiled from Poona. “While the latter,” says the paper, “never rose in the estimation of the government higher than the chieftain of the Dakoits , Chendry, from the beginning of his career was promoted by the government to the high rank of a rebel.” The beginning of the mutiny at Rumla was caused by the inhuman treatment accorded its inhabitants by the police. The law of Abkari,* which did not apply in their district and to which they were not subject, suddenly, and without warning, was"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"enforced, as a result of an arbitrary step taken by the police. From time immemorial, the inhabitants of Rumla drank their toddy without paying a tax for the coconut palms on their own land. The police demanded the payment of a tax on every bush and tree and not only did they beat all those who opposed them, but they also brutally raped the wives and daughters while helping –––––––––– * An old law dug up by Sir John Strachey and by him put into effect as an excuse for new taxes on the toddy— a coconut drink. –––––––––– L ETTER F ROM I NDIA  295 the tax c o llectors. The Rumla people killed a police official. They were declared rebels and an armed force was sent to suppress them. At this time, Chendry, known for his prowess, who was hiding in the mountains of Narasapatnam, rushed to the rescue of his countrymen in Rumla, and was unanimously chosen as their leader. Chendry’s first move was to go to the hills of Vizagapatam, where he burned several police stations, beat several policemen and having confiscated their uniforms, ammunition and fire-arms, disguised his men in the uniforms of the unfortunate Sepoys he had killed. A large contingent of police, sent to capture him and his band, was dispersed by the people of Rumla, as it was impossible to distinguish them from the Sepoys, because they were wearing identical uniforms. Following this, Chendry fought a hand to hand encounter with Captain Blaland until the latter turned tail and fled. Mr. Millett, chief inspector of the district of Godâvarî, then came to avenge the captain, but Chendry not only gave his detachment a thorough trouncing, but chased the fugitives for seven miles after which he besieged them for three days at Chodavaram. The detachment was saved only by the timely arrival of the garrison of Godâvarî. It is remarkable that, not only did Chendry refrain from attacking anyone else, but he also protected those natives and Englishmen who did not belong to the police. All his energy and mad vengeance appeared to be directed exclusively against the police and those who had dealings with them. He hacked police Sepoys and agents to pieces, with calculated cruelty. Having caught his victim, he took him to a nearby Pagoda and once there, forced him to circle three times around the idol and then, with one stroke of a sharp sword, beheaded him. Fanatically believing in his idols, he thought that there could be no more pleasant gift to the gods than the heads and the blood of police inspectors and Sepoys. Until recently, the mere name of Chendry made the latter tremble and turn pale. Finally his daring rose to such a point that he sent an offer direct to the government, as if from one warring faction to another. He asked the English to release his mother, wife 296  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"and brother from prison and to recognize him as the leader and commander of the Rumla people. In which case, he would promise not to disturb them further and to grant life even to the hated police. In the last year Chendry had exasperated the English regime to distraction. And now that Chendry’s head has fallen from his shoulders, the Rumla people are not discouraged; an hour after his death they chose another leader who likewise will stop at nothing and who is ready for the most fanatical exploits. On the day that Chendry’s head was sent to Madras, four hundred rebels attacked a strong police garrison, but this is not all. The government expects a sequel to the mutiny at Rumla in the district of Mysore, where there has appeared a band of from 400 to 500 Dakoits. Again the leader of the band is “a young and daring Brâhmana ”—after the type of Phadke—but more cle ve r and courageous than the latter, to judge from the remarks of Amrita and of other pa per s, whi c h are advising the authorities who don’t know what to do with the head of Chendry, to send it to the “ Brâhmana” —for timely cogitation. “Th e he ad of Chendry”—remarks the same paper, making fun of the government—“very evidently contained very little arithmetical capacity. The computations that went on therein were so poor that it didn’t take pains to figure out what awaited it in this fruitless struggle with the government. But if the head did not possess the gift of arithmetical deductions, it was however, replete with logic—that special kind of logic which alone can bring to reason a stubborn government. The logic of Chendry must convince the government, sooner or later, of the fact which its well-wishers have tried to make it see for such a long time, namely, that there is a straw which will break the back of even the most patient and long-suffering camel. The logic of Chendry opened the eyes of the government and proved that there are limits alike to the constantly increasing taxes and to the arbitrary persecution of the police.” “This head,” propounds another paper, “could have been sent from one police station to another, where the officials, while looking at it, could have drawn from their own L ETTER F ROM I NDIA  297 reminisce n ces some most philosophical deductions. Later it could have been converted, with great usefulness for India, into a paperweight and placed in the study of Sir John Strachey, where he is wont to squeeze from the bottomless depths of his creative imagination new taxation laws; in this manner, the severed head, reminding the noble gentleman of the limits of human patience regarding taxes, could have served as a yardstick for his future speculations; it could have whispered in his ear that there is a limit beyond which even the most patient of people refuse to be driven even by him, a limit where even the most peaceful and dependable of her majesty’s subjects lose not only all their patience, but even, all joking aside, their heads. With equal success, our"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"rulers could send ‘the head’ to those of their clique who first conceived and formulated as a law, the universal disarmament of the country ( Arms Act ). This severed head alone can solve the problem as to the extent the above-mentioned law became a serious obstacle to the plans and armed maneuvers against the government, at least in the case of the ‘Dakoit’ Chendry. And only when we arrive at a categorical solution of the problem of disarmament, and consequently that of India’s ‘helplessness’ in case of a newly-conceived mutiny, only then, we say, will the government have a perfect right to exhibit such heads in the squares, loudly proclaiming to the whole world : ‘look and tremble; thus perish in the lands conquered by us, those who dare to take up arms against the power of Great Britain!’ . . .” Local newspaper expressions of discontent, of course, do not carry much weight with the British administration in India. But an outside observer might naturally ask how is it that 60,000 Europeans can be the rulers of a discontented mass of nearly 240,000,000 people, even if that mass is lawfully disarmed. It is not arms or courage that is lacking in the Hindus, but harmony and unanimity of purpose. Century-long hatred between various sects as well as the caste system— that is the plank of salvation for Great Britain in her Indian Empire, and more particularly, the moribund patriotism and the lack of the feeling of self-respect. The 298  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Brâhmana w hose naked foot rubs the Śû dra into the dirt, in turn, cowers in the dust be for e every European. Only yesterday, while saying goodbye to a friend on the platform of the railroad station, one of the most distinguished princely descendants of Poona received a deadly insult, and he suffered it in absolute submission. For no reason, a half-drunk Englishman, who was passing by, loudly shouted, “Here is one of those traitors and intrigants—a Poona Brâhma n a,” and with one fell swoop knocked his tu rb an under the wheels of the train. A great many native policemen were around and the Brâhma Š a, who is personally known to the Governor-General of Bombay, with whom Sir Richard Temin often dines, just blanched and helplessly looked around with amazement. The law does not permit a native policeman to arrest an Englishman, even if the latter were to commit a murder before his eyes, and there did not happen to be on the platform at the time, any European constables . And even if there had been, it would have been ten to one, he would not have arrested his countryman at the request of a native and he might even have appeared in court as a witness for the former. The drunken Englishman seated himself in the train and went away laughing . . . I am describing this scene as an eyewitness. Native princes in their turn have every reason in the world to be dissatisfied with the English administration and have no reason whatsoever to love the Englishmen and to nourish feelings of loyalty. It is true that the Prince of Wales, as well as the Duke of Edinborough, were received with honor by these same princes and have been praised and wined and dined"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"and assured of loyalty. It seems that these Princes live in perfect harmony and friendship with Lord Lytton; they constantly send through their political Residents their assurances of perfect adherence and loyalty to the administration. When the Prince of Wales fell dangerously ill and the doctors feared for his life, the Hindu Princes ordered the Brâhma n as to conduct public services for his recovery, fed the poor, spent big sums of mo ne y on idols and priests and sent L ETTER F ROM I NDIA  299 telegram s every day to London. When the Prince recovered, the Mahârâjas almost went broke on public festivities. Many of them were the first to offer help in the war with Abyssinia and finally, when the Afghân war was declared, all of them, to the last one, offered help and money. In spite of all this, it is hardly possible for the British government to rely upon this seemingly sincere loyalty. The Examiner , summing up things, comes to the conclusion that it is utterly impossible for the Hindu Princes, if they are men and not blockheads, to love the Englishman. This paper reminds us that when the government took India from the East India Company, a solemn proclamation was sent all over the country, in which the Queen gave her royal promise to the native princes that as long as they remained loyal, nobody would interfere at any time with their internal affairs. The inviolability of their rights and privileges, of the customs of their land, their religion and their laws were especially guaranteed and the honor and dignity of their rank—the proclamation assured—were from now jealously guarded by the government of the mother-country. Well, what then? The British government in India did not abide by a single one of the promises expressed in the royal proclamation; it circumvented each one of them, one after the other; and while the Princes carried out every one of the clauses, they were persecuted and insulted on every possible occasion; there were interferences, not only in the affairs of state, but also in their local administrations and their every step was under the strict supervision of the Residents. The Princes are being pushed about like pawns; they are being deprived of their legal heritage, they are being shoved about and denied their thrones. The Mahârâja of Rewah who, more than any other, helped the English crush the rebellion of 1857 and whose services were so great that the Queen herself ordered him elevated to the illustrious rank of Grand Commander of the Star of India—this Mahârâja was ordered either to abdicate and receive a pension or to expect a shameful dethroning—and all this without any reason other than that of suspicion without evidence. What can we expect from Sindhia, the 300  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"most important of the independent Hindu princes? “During the rebellion,” says the Examiner , “he stood by us all through the difficult times, and since then proved more than once, his loyalty and goodwill, while we—we did not carry out a single one of the promises we gave him. We interfered with his public and private affairs, insulted him by false denunciations and treated him with the greatest distrust. We declare without the slightest hesitation that the most solemn guarantees of three Viceroys have turned out to be false . . . while Sindhia has also been raised to a Grand Commander of the Star of India for his loyalty in the years 1857-1858, our armies are occupying his capital and fortress and our guns point to his palace . . . at this very moment there is in England a Râjâ who has been denied his lawful rights by the British Administration of India; the throne to which he had a lawful right became vacant, but the rulers of India, contrary to laws, customs and proclamation and everything else, refused him the right of succession. They put in his place a bastard relative, whose behavior became so shameful that they were forced to remove him in less than a year . . . after his removal they undertook the administration of the state and its revenues themselves. As we have pointed out, the rightful heir is in London, living almost as a beggar. There are no obstacles whatsoever to his succession. He is a trustworthy and able man and, most important of all, he is the direct heir. And now, you see, while he is starving in London, trying to find justice, the British Resident receives 6,000 pounds sterling from his revenues, for peacefully ruling in his stead.” The voice of the “alarmists” such as the Examiner doesn’t have much importance after all. The British government is quite secure in its domination over India. Whom could the Englishman fear in this land of conquered and weakened slaves—could be asked by the native press (in India there are published more than 3000 daily, weekly and monthly papers and journals in English and in more than fifty vernaculars)? Surely it wouldn’t be the alliance of native princes, whose every step is being watched by L ETTER F ROM I NDIA  301 the Engli s h Residents, who hold them on a leash and do not let them out of their sight, even in their own bedrooms. These princes divided among themselves by mutual distrust and envy, demoralized by English education, are not to be feared by England. There remain the people as a whole. But can such a people be dangerous? These teeming millions are timorous, patient beasts of burden, despised by the higher castes, spat upon by their own people and by strangers, ready to sell for a mere pittance or for a piece of bread, their own gods, fathers, mothers and children, accustomed to centuries of slavery and utterly indifferent to who rules the country, if only they could be less beaten and fed a little more; and who vaguely sense that were the English to retire tomorrow, they would be more badly treated by their own. A general rebellion is unthinkable in India; and local uprisings are quite familiar to Englishmen and they will always be able to crush them. Nevertheless, this domination is bought for a high price. India has cost England in"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"the last years more than all her colonies put together, from the time of their acquisition. England neither sleeps nor eats, but that she is thinking of how to safeguard not only the highway to India, but every nook and cranny around it as well. Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, all these places serve as outposts and require soldiers and money. For the sake of India alone, England has bought up all the shares of the Suez Canal, taken Cyprus from the helpless Turks and Hongkong from the Chinese. On account of India, England gets constantly entangled with China, Burma, Persia, Afghânistân and especially with Russia. Her main concern at present is to watch every move of Russia. Local papers assure us that all these difficulties would vanish if the British authorities would decide to transfer the administration to the hands of the natives, giving them the right to choose and establish their own laws and to administer the country according to their best discretion. For the purpose of conducting foreign affairs, the papers favor an English governor, appointed from England. The collection of taxes must remain in the hands of the natives, who would assume the responsibilities of paying out of these, 302  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS sums for the upkeep of a certain number of British troops in India.

Thick as may be the curtain behind which the history of these antiquities is hidden, still there are rents here and there through which one may catch glimpses of light. We are acquainted with the descendants of the builders. And, however superficially, we also know the story of the nations whose vestiges are scattered around us. Not so with the antiquities of the New World of the two Americas. There, all along the coast of Peru, all over the Isthmus and North America, in the canyons of the Cordilleras, in the impassable gorges of the Andes, and, especially beyond the valley of Mexico, lie, ruined and desolate, hundreds of once mighty cities, lost to the memory of men, and having themselves lost even a name. Buried in dense forests, entombed in inaccessible valleys, sometimes sixty feet underground, from the day of their discovery until now they have ever remained a riddle to science, baffling all inquiry, and they have been muter than the Egyptian Sphinx herself. We know nothing of America prior to the Conquest—positively nothing. No chronicles, not even comparatively modern ones survive; there are no traditions, even among the aboriginal tribes, as to its past events. We are as ignorant of 304  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS the races that built these cyclopean structures, as of the strange worship that inspired the antedil u vian sculptors, who carved upon hundreds of miles of walls, of monuments, monoliths and altars, these weird hieroglyphics, these groups of animals and men, pictures of an unknown life and lost arts—scenes so fantastic and wild, at times, that they involuntarily suggest the idea of a feverish dream, whose phantasmagoria at the wave of some mighty magician’s hand suddenly crystallized into granite, to bewilder the coming generations for ever and ever. So late as the beginning of the present century, the very existence of such a wealth of antiquities was unknown. The petty, suspicious jealousy of the Spaniards had, from the first, created a sort of Chinese wall between their American possessions and the too curious traveller; and the ignorance and fanaticism of the conquerors, and their carelessness as to all but the satisfaction of their insatiable"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"greediness, had precluded scientific research. Even the enthusiastic accounts of Cortez and his army of brigands and priests, and of Pizarro and his robbers and monks, as to the splendour of the temples, palaces, and cities of Mexico and Peru, were long discredited. In his The History of America , Dr. Wm. Robertson goes so far as to inform his reader that the houses of the ancient Mexicans were “mere huts, built with turf, or mud, or the branches of trees, like those of the rudest Indians”;* and, upon the testimony of some Spaniards he even risked the assertion that “in all the extent of that vast empire,” there was not “a single monument or vestige of any building more ancient than the conquest”! It was reserved to the great Alexander Humboldt to vindicate the truth. In 1803 a new flood of light was poured into the world of archaeology by this eminent and learned traveller. In this he luckily proved but the pioneer of future discoverers. He then described but Mitla, or the Vale of the Dead. Xochicalco, and the great pyramidal Temple of Cholula.

Since then, numerous travellers have visited and given us accurate details of many of the antiquities. But, how many more yet remain not only unexplored, but even unknown, no one can tell. As regards prehistoric buildings, both Peru and Mexico are rivals of Egypt. Equalling the latter in the immensity of her cyclopean structures, Peru surpasses her in their number; while Cholula exceeds the grand pyramid of Cheops in breadth, if not in height. Works of public utility, such as walls, fortifications, terraces, watercourses, aqueducts, bridges, temples, burial-grounds, whole cities, and exquisitely paved roads, hundreds of miles in length, stretch in an unbroken line, almost covering the land as with a net. On the coast, they are built of sun-dried bricks; in the mountains, of porphyritic lime, granite, and silicated sandstone. Of the long generations of peoples who built them, history knows nothing, and even tradition is silent. As a matter of course, most of these lithic remains are covered with a dense vegetation. Whole forests have grown out of the broken hearts of the cities, and, with a few exceptions, everything is in ruin. But one may judge of what once was by that which yet remains. With a most flippant unconcern, the Spanish historians refer nearly every ruin to Incal times. No greater mistake can be made. The hieroglyphics which sometimes cover from top to bottom whole walls and monoliths are, as the were from the first, a dead letter to modern science. But they were equally a dead letter to the Incas, though the history of the latter can be traced to the eleventh century. They had no clue to the meaning of these inscriptions. but attributed all such to their unknown predecessors; thus barring the presumption of their own descent from the first civilizers of their country.

The Incas, judged by their exclusive privileges, power, and “infallibility,” are the antipodal counterpart of the Brahmanical caste of India. Like the latter, the Incas claimed direct descent from Deity, which, as in the case of the Sûryavan ś a dynasty of India, was the Sun. According to the sole but general tra d ition, there was a time when the whole of the population of the now New World was broken up into independent, warring, and barbarian tribes. At last, the “Highest” deity—the Sun—took pity upon them, and, in order to rescue the people from ignorance, sent down upon earth, to teach them, his two children Manco Capac and his sister and wife, Mama Oella Huaca—the counterparts, again, of the Egyptian Osiris, and his sister and wife, Isis, as well as of the several Hindu gods and demi-gods and their wives. These two made their appearance on a beautiful island in Lake Titicaca—of which we will speak further on—and thence proceeded northward to Cuzco, later on the capital of the Incas, where they at once began to disseminate civilization. Collecting together the various races from all parts of Peru, the divine couple then divided their labour. Manco Capac taught men agriculture, legislation, architecture, and arts; while Mama Oella instructed the women in weaving, spinning, embroidery, and housekeeping. It is from this celestial pair that the Incas claimed their descent; and yet, they were utterly ignorant of the people who built the stupendous and now ruined cities which cover the whole area of their empire, and which then extended from the Equator to over 37 degrees of [South] Latitude, and included not only the western slope of the Andes, but the whole mountain chain with its eastern declivities to the Amazon and Orinoco. As the direct descendants of the Sun, they were exclusively the high priests of the state religion, and at the same time emperors and the highest statesmen in the land; in virtue of which, they, again like the Brahmans, arrogated to themselves a A L AND OF M YSTERY  307 divine su p eriority over the ordinary mortals, thus founding like the “twice-born” an exclusive and aristocratic caste—the Inca race. Considered as the son of the Sun, every"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"reigning Inca was the high priest, the oracle, chief captain in war, and absolute sovereign; thus realizing the double office of Pope and King, and so long anticipating the dream of the Roman Pontiffs. To his command the blindest obedience was exacted; his person was sacred; and he was the object of divine honours. The highest officers of the land could not appear shod in his presence ; this mark of respect pointing again to an Oriental origin; while the custom of boring the ears of the youths of royal blood and inserting in them golden rings “which were increased in size as they advanced in rank, until the distention of the cartilage became a positive deformity,” suggests a strange resemblance between the sculptured portraits of many of them that we find in the more modern ruins, and the images of Buddha and of some Hindu deities, not to mention our contemporary dandies of Siam, Burma, and Southern India. In that, once more like in India, in the palmy days of the Brahmin power, no one had the right to either receive an education or study religion except the young men of the privileged Inca caste. And, when the reigning Inca died, or as it was termed, “was called home to the mansion of his father,” a very large number of his attendants and his wives were made to die with him, during the ceremony of his obsequies, just as we find in the old annals of Râjasthân, and down to the but just abolished custom of Suttee. Taking all this into consideration, the archaeologist cannot remain satisfied with the brief remark of certain historians that “in this tradition we trace only another version of the story of the civilization common to all primitive nations, and that imposture of a celestial relationship whereby designing rulers and cunning priests have sought to secure their ascendancy among men.” No more is it an explanation to say that “Manco Capac is the almost exact counterpart of the Chinese Fohi, the Hindu Buddha, the terrestrial Osiris of Egypt, the Quetzalcohuatl of Mexico, and Votan of Central America”; for all this is but too evident. What we want 308  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS to learn is, how came these nations, so antipodal to each other as India, Egypt, and America , t o offer such extraordinary points of resemblance, not only in their general religious, political, and social views, but sometimes in the minutest details. The much-needed task is to find out which one of them preceded the other; to explain how these people came to plant at the four corners of the earth nearly identical architecture and arts, unless there was a time when, as assured by Plato and believed in by more than one modern archaeologist, no ships were needed for such a transit, as the two worlds formed but one continent. According to the most recent researches, there are five distinct styles of architecture in the Andes alone, of which the Temple of the Sun at Cuzco was the latest. And this one, perhaps, is the only structure of importance which, according to modern travellers, can be safely attributed to the Incas, whose imperial glories are believed to have been the last gleam of a civilization dating back for untold ages. Dr. E. R. Heath, of Kansas (U.S.A.), thinks that . . . long before Manco Capac, the Andes had been the dwelling-place of races, whose beginnings must"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"have been coëval with the savages of Western Europe. The gigantic architecture points to the Cyclopean family, the founders of the Temple of Babel, and the Egyptian pyramids.

While Cholula, Uxmal, Quiché, Pachacamac, and Chichen were all perfectly preserved and occupied at the time of the invasion of the Spanish banditti , there are hundreds of ruined cities and works which were in the same state of ruin even then; whose origin was unknown to the conquered Incas and Caciques as it is to us; and which are undoubtedly the remains of unknown and now extinct peoples. The strange shapes of the heads, and profiles of the human figures upon the monoliths of Copán are a warrant for the correctness of the hypothesis. The pronounced difference between the skulls of these races and the Indo-European skulls was at first attributed to mechanical means, used by the mothers for giving a peculiar conformation to the head of their children during infancy, as is often done by other tribes and peoples. But, as the same author tells us, the finding in “a mummy of a foetus of seven or eight months having the same conformation of skull, has placed a doubt as to the certainty of this fact.” And besides hypothesis, we have a scientific and an unimpeachable proof of a civilization that must have existed in Peru ages ago. Were we to give the number of thousands of years that have probably elapsed since then, without first showing good reasons for the assumption, the reader might feel like holding his breath. So let us try. The Peruvian guano ( huano ), that precious fertilizer, composed of the excrement of sea-fowl, intermixed with their decaying bodies, eggs, remains of seal, and so on, which has accumulated upon the isles of the Pacific and the coast of South America, and its formation are now well known. It was Humboldt who first discovered and drew the world’s attention to it in 1804. And, while describing the deposits as covering the granite rocks of the Chinchas and other islands to the depth of 50 or 60 feet, he states that the accumulation of the preceding 300 years , since the ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"* [ Ibid ., p. 468.] –––––––––– 310  B LAVAT SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Conquest , had formed only a few lines in thickness . How m any thousands of years, then, it required to form this deposit 60 feet deep, is a matter of simple calculation. In this connection we may now quote something of a discovery spoken of in the “Peruvian Antiquities.”* Buried 62 feet under the ground, on the Chincha islands, stone idols and water pots were found, while 35 and 3 3 feet below the surface were wooden idols. Beneath the guano on the Guañape islands, just south of Truxillo, and Macabi just north, mummies , birds , and birds ’ eggs , gold and silver ornaments were taken . On the Macabi the laborers found some large valuable golden vases, which they broke up and divided among themselves, even though offered weight for weight in gold coin, and thus have relics of greatest interest to the scientist been for ever lost. He who can determine the centuries necessary to deposit thirty and sixty feet of guano on these islands, remembering that, since the conquest three hundred years ago, no appreciable increase in depth has been noted, can give you an idea of the antiquity of these relics.† If we confine ourselves to a strictly arithmetical calculation, then, allowing 12 lines to an inch, and 12 inches to a foot, and allowing one line to every century, we are forced to believe that the people who made these precious gold vases lived 864,000 years ago! Leave an ample margin for errors, and give two lines to a century—say an inch to every 100 years—and we will yet have 72,000 years back a civilization which—if we judge by its public works, the durability of its constructions, and the grandeur of its buildings—equalled, and in some things certainly surpassed, our own. Having well defined ideas as to the periodicity of cycles, for the world as well as for nations, empires, and tribes, we are convinced that our present modern civilization is but the latest dawn of that which already has been seen an innumerable number of times upon this planet. It may not be exact science, but it is both inductive and deductive logic, based upon theories far less hypothetical and more palpable ————— * A paper published by Mr. E. R. Heath in the Kansas C ity Review of Science and Industry , November 1878. † [ Op . cit ., p. 463.] –––––––––– A L AND OF M YS T ERY  311 than man y another theory, held as strictly scientific. To express it in the words of Professor F. E.

It may be very distasteful and a great fatigue to suspend a conclusion, but as we are not infallible, so we ought to be cautious.” ( Experimental Researches , 24th Series.) It is doubtful whether, with the exception of a few of the most prominent ruins, there ever was attempted a detailed account of the so-called American antiquities. Yet, in order to bring out the more prominently a point of comparison, such a work would be absolutely necessary. If the history of religion and of mythology and—far more important—the origin, developing and final grouping, of the human species are ever to be unravelled, we have to trust to archaeological research, rather than to the hypothetical deductions of philology. We must begin by massing together the concrete imagery of the early thought, more eloquent in its stationary form than the verbal expression of the same, the latter being but too liable, in its manifold interpretations, to be distorted in a thousand ways. This would afford us an easier and more trustworthy clue. Archaeological Societies ought to have a whole cyclopaedia of the world’s remains, with a collation of the most important of the speculations as to each locality. For, however fantastic and wild some of these hypotheses may seem at first glance, yet each has a chance of proving useful at some time. It is often more beneficial to know what a thing is not than to know what it is , as Max Müller truly tells us. It is not within the limits of an article in our paper that any such object could be achieved. Availing ourselves, 312  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS though, of the reports of the Government surveyors, trustworthy travellers, men of science , a nd even our own limited experience, we will try in future issues to give to our Hindu readers, who possibly may never have heard of these antiquities, a general idea of them. Our latest information is drawn from every reliable source; the survey of the Peruvian antiquities being mostly due to Dr. Heath’s able paper, above mentioned. ———— [ The Theosophist , Vol. I, No. 7, April, 1880, pp. 170-173] Evidently, we, Theosophists, are not the only iconoclasts in this world of mutual decepti o n and hypocrisy. We are not the only ones who believe in cycles and, opposing"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"the Biblical chronology, lean towards those opinions which secretly are shared by so many, but publicly avowed by so few. We, Europeans, are just emerging from the very bottom of a new cycle, and progressing upwards, while the Asiatics Hindus especially—are the lingering remnants of the nations which filled the world in the previous and now departed cycles. Whether the Aryans sprang from the archaic Americans, or the latter from the prehistorical Aryans, is a question which no living man can decide. But that there must have been an intimate connection at some time between the old Aryans, the prehistoric inhabitants of America—whatever might have been their name—and the ancient Egyptians, is a matter more easily proved than contradicted. And probably, if there ever was such a connection, it must have taken place at a time when the Atlantic did not yet divide the two hemispheres as it does now. In his “Peruvian Antiquities” (see The Theosophist for March) Dr. Heath, of Kansas City— rara avis among scientific men, a fearless searcher, who accepts truth wherever he finds it, and is not afraid to speak it out in the very face A L AND OF M YSTERY  313 o f d o g m a t ic opposition—sums up his impressions of the Peruvian relics in the following words: Three times the Andes sank hundreds of feet beneath the ocean level, and again were slowly brought to their p r esent height. A man’s life would be too short to count even the centuries consumed in this operation. The coast of Peru has risen eighty feet since it felt the tread of Pizarro. Supposing the Andes to have risen uniformly and without interruption, seventy thousand years must have elapsed before they reached their present altitude. Who knows, then, but that Jules Verne’s fanciful idea* regarding the lost continent Atlanta may be near the truth? Who can say, that where now is the Atlantic Ocean, formerly did not exist a continent, with its dense population, advanced in the arts and sciences, who, as they found their land sinking beneath the waters, retired, part east and part west, populating thus the two new hemispheres? This would explain the similarity of their archæological structures and races and their differences, modified by and adapted to the character of their respective climates and countries. Thus could the llama and the camel differ, although of the same species; thus the algoraba and espino trees; thus the Iroquois Indians of North America and the most ancient Arabs call the constellation of the “Great Bear” by the same name; thus various nations, cut off from all intercourse or knowledge of each other, divide the zodiac in twelve constellations, apply to them the same names, and the Northern Hindoos apply the name Andes to their Himalayan mountains, as did the South Americans to their principal chain.† Must we fall in the old rut and suppose no other means of populating the Western Hemisphere except “by way of Behring’s Strait”? Must we still locate a geographical Eden in the East, and suppose a land equally adapted to man and as old geologically, must wait the aimless wanderings of the “lost tribe of Israel” to become populated?‡ ————— * This idea is plainly expressed and asserted as a fact by Plato in his B a n q u e t ; and was taken up by Lord Bacon in his New Atlantis .

Whoever has seen one of these mounds has seen all. Whoever has stood before the cyclopean structures of one continent can have a pretty accurate idea of those of the other. Only be it said—we know still less of the age of the antiquities of America than even of those in the Valley of the Nile, of which we know next to nothing. But their symbolism—apart from their outward form—is evidently the same as in Egypt, India, and elsewhere. As before the great pyramid of Cheops in Cairo, so before the great mound, 100 feet high, on the plain of Cahokia—near St. Louis (Missouri)—which measures 700 feet long by 500 feet broad at the base, and covers upwards of eight acres of ground, having 20,000,000 cubic feet of contents, and the mound on the banks of Brush Creek, Ohio, so accurately described by Squier and Davis, one knows not whether to admire more the geometrical precision, prescribed by the wonderful and mysterious builders in the form of their monuments, or the hidden symbolism they evidently sought to express. The Ohio mound represents a serpent, upwards of 1,000 feet long. Gracefully coiled in capricious curves, it terminates in a triple coil at the tail. “The embankment constituting the effigy, is upwards of five feet in height, by thirty feet base at the centre of the body, diminishing somewhat toward the head and tail.”* The neck is stretched out and its mouth wide opened, holding within its jaws an oval figure. “This oval is formed by an embankment four feet in height, and is perfectly regular in outline, its transverse and conjugate diameters being 160 and 80 feet respectively,” say the surveyors. The whole ————— * [ New American Cyclopaedia , 1873 - 76, art. on “American Antiquities”; same ref. in the case of the quotation immediately following. —Compiler .] –––––––––– A L AND OF M YS T ERY  315 represe n ts the universal cosmological idea of the serpent and the egg. This is easy to surmise. But how came this great symbol of the Hermetic wisdom of old Egypt to find itself represented in North America? How is it that the sacred buildings found in Ohio"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"and elsewhere, these squares, circles, octagons, and other geometrical figures, in which one recognizes so easily the prevailing idea of the Pythagorean sacred numerals, seem copied from the Book of Numbers ? Apart from the complete silence as to their origin, even among the Indian tribes, who have otherwise preserved their own traditions in every case, the antiquity of these ruins is proved by the existence of the largest and most ancient forests growing on the buried cities. The prudent archaeologists of America have generously assigned them 2,000 years. But by whom built, and whether their authors migrated, or disappeared beneath victorious arms, or were swept out of existence by some direful epidemic, or a universal famine, are questions, “probably beyond the power of human investigations to answer,” they say.* The earliest inhabitants of Mexico, of whom history has any knowledge—more hypothetical than proven—are the Toltecs. These are supposed to have come from the North and believed to have entered Anahuac in the 7th century A.D. They are also credited with having constructed in Central America, where they spread in the eleventh century, some of the great cities whose ruins still exist. In this case it is they who must also have carved the hieroglyphics that cover some of the relics. How is it then, that the pictorial system of writing of Mexico, which was used by the conquered people and learned by the conquerors and their missionaries, does not yet furnish the keys to the hieroglyphics of Palenque and Copán, not to mention those of Peru? And these civilized Toltecs themselves, who were they, and whence did they come? And who are the Aztecs that succeeded them? Even among the hieroglyphical systems of Mexico, there were some which the foreign interpreters were precluded the possibility of studying. These were the so-called schemes –––––––––– * [ New Amer . Cyclop ., a s above.— Compiler .] –––––––––– 316  B LAVA T SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS of judicial astrology “given but not explained in Lord Kingsborough’s published collect i on,”* and set down as purely figurative and symbolical, “intended only for the use of the priests and diviners and possessed of an esoteric significance.” Many of the hieroglyphics on the monoliths of Palenque and Copán are of the same character. The “priests and diviners” were all killed off by the Catholic fanatics—the secret died with them. Nearly all the mounds in North America are terraced and ascended by large graded ways, sometimes square, often hexagonal, octagonal or truncated, but in all respects similar to the teocallis of Mexico, and to the topes of India. As the latter are attributed throughout this country to the work of the five Pandus of the Lunar Race, so the cyclopean monuments and monoliths on the shores of Lake Titicaca, in the republic of Bolivia, are ascribed to giants, the five exiled brothers “from beyond the mounts.” They worshipped the moon as their progenitor and lived before the time of the “Sons and Virgins of the Sun .” Here, the similarity of the Aryan with the South American tradition"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"is again but too obvious, and the Solar and Lunar races—Sûrya- Van \u0001 a and the Chandra- Van \u0001 a—reappear in America. This Lake Ti ticaca, which occupies the centre of one of the most remarkable terrestrial basins on the whole globe, is “160 miles long and from 50 to 80 broad, and discharges through the valley of El Desaguadero, to the south-east into another lake called Lake Aullagas, which is probably kept at a lower level by evaporation or filtration, since it has no known outlet. The surface of the lake is 12,846 feet above the sea, and it is the most elevated body of water of similar size in the world.”† As the level of its waters has very much decreased in the historical period, it is believed on good grounds that they once surrounded the elevated spot on which are found the remarkable ruins of Tiahuanaco. –––––––––– * [This has reference to Agostino Àglio’s Antiquities o f Mexico , edited with copious notes by E.

Although the traditions of the Incas maintain that the great lawgiver and teacher of the Peruvians, Manco Capac—the Manu of South America—diffused his knowledge and influence from this centre, yet the statement is unsupported by facts. If the original seat of the Aymara, or “Inca race” was there, as claimed by some, how is it that neither the Incas, nor the Aymaras, who dwell on the shores of the Lake to this day, nor yet the ancient Peruvians, had the slightest knowledge concerning their history? Beyond a vague tradition which tells us of “giants” having built these immense structures in one night, we do not find the faintest clue. And, we have every reason to doubt whether the Incas are of the Aymara race at all. The Incas claim their descent from Manco Capac, the son of the Sun, and the Aymaras claim this legislator as their instructor and the founder of the era of their civilization. Yet, neither the Incas of the Spanish period could prove the one, nor the Aymaras the other. The language of the latter is quite distinct from the Inichua— the tongue of the Incas; and they were the only race that refused to give up their language when conquered by the descendants of the Sun, as Dr. Heath tells us. The ruins afford every evidence of the highest antiquity. Some are built on a pyramidal plan, as most of the American mounds are, and cover several acres; while the monolithic doorways, pillars, and stone-idols, so elaborately carved, are “sculptured in a style wholly different from any other remains of art yet found in America.”* D’Orbigny speaks of the ruins in the most enthusiastic manner. These monuments [he says] consist of a mound raised nearly 100 feet, surrounded with pillars—of temples f r om 600 to 1,200 feet in length, opening precisely toward the east, and adorned with colossal"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"angular columns—of porticoes of a single stone, covered with reliefs of skilful execution though of rude design, displaying symbolical representations of the Sun, and the condor his messenger—of basaltic –––––––––– * [ Op . cit ., art. on “Tiahuanaco.”— Compiler .] –––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME II 1880 318  B LA V ATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS statues loaded with bas-reliefs, in which the design of the carved head is half Egyptian—and lastly, of the interior of a palace formed of enormous blocks of rock completely hewn, whose dimensions are often 21 feet in length, 12 in breadth, and 6 in thickness. In the temples and palaces, the portals are not inclined as among those of the Incas, but perpendicular; and their vast dimensions, and the imposing masses of which they are composed, surpass in beauty and grandeur all that were afterward built by the sovereigns of Cuzco.* Like the rest of his fellow-explorers, d’Orbigny believes these ruins to have been the work of a race far anterior to the Incas. Two distinct styles of architecture are found in these relics of Lake Titicaca. Those of the Island of Coati, for instance, bear every feature in common with the ruins of Tiahuanaco; so do the vast blocks of stone elaborately sculptured, some of which, according to the report of the surveyors, in 1846, measure: “3 feet in length by 18 feet in width, and 6 feet in thickness”; while on some of the islands of the Lake Titicaca there are monuments of great extent, “but of true Peruvian type, apparently the remains of temples destroyed on the arrival of the Spaniards.” The famous sanctuary, with the human figure in it, belongs to the former. Its doorway 10 feet high, 13 feet broad, with an opening 6 feet 4 inches, by 3 feet 2 inches, is cut from a single stone. “Its east front has a cornice, in the centre of which is a human figure of strange form, crowned with rays , interspersed with serpents with crested heads. On each side of this figure are three rows of square compartments, filled with human and other figures, of apparently symbolic design . . .” Were this temple in India, it would undoubtedly be attributed to ® iva; but it is at the antipodes, where neither the foot of a Shaiva nor one of the Naga tribe has ever penetrated to the knowledge of man, though the Mexican Indians have their Nagual, or chief sorcerer and serpent worshipper. “The ruins stand on an eminence, which, from the watermarks around it, seems to have been formerly an island in Lake Titicaca; but the level of the lake is now 135 feet lower, and its shores 12 miles distant. This fact, in –––––––––– * [ New Amer .

It seems to have been the seat of the highest and most ancient civilization of South America and of a people who have left the most gigantic monuments of their power and skill.” And these monuments are all either Dracontias— temples sacred to the Snake, or temples dedicated to the Sun. Of this same character are the ruined pyramids of Teotihuacan and the monoliths of Palenque and Copán. The former are some eight leagues from the city of Mexico on the plain of Otumla, and considered among the most ancient in the land. The two principal ones are dedicated to the Sun and Moon, respectively. They are built of cut stone, square, with four stories and a level area at the top. The larger, that of the Sun, is 221 feet high, 680 feet square at the base, and covers an area of 11 acres, nearly equal to that of the great pyramid of Cheops. And yet, the pyramid of Cholula, higher than that of Teotihuacan by ten feet according to Humboldt, and having 1,400 feet square at the base, covers an area of 45 acres! It is interesting to hear what the earliest writers—the historians who saw them during the first conquest—say even of some of the most modern of these buildings, of the great temple of Mexico, among others. It consisted of an immense square area “surrounded by a wall of stone and lime, eight feet thick, with battlements, ornamented with many stone figures in the form of serpents ,” says one. Cortez shows that 500 houses might be easily placed within its enclosure. It was paved with polished stones, so smooth, that “the horses of the Spaniards could not move over them without slipping,” writes Bernal Díaz del Castillo. In connection with this, we must remember that it was not the Spaniards who conquered the Mexicans, but their horses . As there never –––––––––– * New American Cyclopaedia , art. on “ Tiahuanaco.” [This applies to all the passages quoted in the above paragraph.— Compiler .] –––––––––– 320  B LAVA T SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS was a horse seen before by this people in America, until the Europeans landed it on the coast, th e natives, though excessively brave, “were so awestruck at the sight of horses and the roar of the artillery,” that they took the Spaniards to be of divine origin and sent them human beings as sacrifices. This superstitious panic is sufficient to account for the fact that a handful of men could so easily conquer incalculable thousands of warriors. According to F. López de Gómara, the four walls of the enclosure of the temple corresponded with the cardinal points. “In the centre of this gigantic area arose the great temple, an immense pyramidal structure of 5 stages, faced with stone, 300 feet square at the base and 120 feet in height, truncated, with a level summit, upon which were situated"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"two towers, the shrines of the divinities to whom it was consecrated”—Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli. It was here that the sacrifices were performed, and the eternal fire maintained . F. J. Clavijero tells us, that “besides this great pyramid . . . there were forty other similar structures of smaller size, consecrated to separate divinities. One was called Tezcacalli , ‘House of the Shining Mirrors,’ . . . sacred to Tezcatlipoca , the God of Light, the Soul of the World, the Vivifier, the Spiritual Sun.” The dwellings of priests, who, according to Zarate, amounted to 5,000, were near by, as well as the seminaries and the schools. “Ponds and fountains, groves and gardens, in which flowers and ‘sweet smelling herbs’ were cultivated for use in certain sacred rites, and for the decoration of altars,” were in abundance; and, so large was the inner yard, that “8,000 or 10,000 persons had sufficient room to dance in it, upon their solemn festivals”—says de Solís. Torquemada estimates the number of such temples in the Mexican empire at 40,000, but Clavijero, speaking of the majestic Teocallis (literally, houses of God) of Mexico, estimates the number higher. So wonderful are the features of resemblance between the ancient shrines of the Old and the New World that Humboldt remains unequal to express his surprise. “What FACSIMILE OF A DOCUMENT IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, ADYAR ( Page One of the Document ) Consult Appendix by the Compiler, pp. 339-43 in this Volume."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"FACSIMILE OF A DOCUMENT IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, ADYAR ( Page Two of the Document ) A L AND OF M YSTERY  321 strikin g analogies exist between the monuments of the old continents and those of the Toltecs who . . . built several of these colossal structures, truncated pyramids, divided by layers, like the temple of Belus at Babylon!

The code of the Aztecs, says Prescott “evinces a profound respect for the great principles of morality, and as clear a perception of these principles as is to be found in the most cultivated nations.” Some of these are very curious inasmuch as they show such a similarity to some of the Gospel ethics, “He, who looks too curiously on a woman, commits adultery with his eyes,” says one of them. “Keep peace with all; bear injuries with humility; God, who sees, will avenge you,” declares another. Recognizing but one Supreme Power in Nature, they addressed it as the deity “by whom we live, Omnipresent, that knoweth all thoughts, and giveth all gifts, without whom man is as nothing; invisible, incorporeal . . . of perfect perfection and purity, under whose wings we find repose and a sure defence.” And, in naming their children, says Lord Kingsborough, they used a ceremony strongly resembling the Christian rite of baptism, “the lips and bosom of the infant were sprinkled with water, and the Lord was implored to permit the holy drops to wash away the sin that was given"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"to it before the foundation of the world; so that the child might be born anew .”† “Their laws were perfect; justice, contentment –––––––––– * [Quoted passages associated with the names of Bernal Díaz del Castillo, López de Gómara, F.

Massively built, with walls of a great th i ckness, they are usually marked by broad stairways, leading to the principal entrance. When composed of several stories, each successive story is usually smaller than that below it, giving the structure the appearance of a pyramid of several stages. The front walls, either made of stone or stuccoed, are covered with elaborately carved, symbolical figures; and the interior divided into corridors and dark chambers, with arched ceilings, the roofs supported by overlapping courses of stones, “constituting a pointed arch, corresponding in type with the earliest monuments of the old world.” Within several chambers at Palenque, tablets, covered with sculptures and hieroglyphics of fine design and artistic execution, were discovered by Stephens. In Honduras, at Copán, a whole city—temples, houses and grand monoliths intricately carved—was unearthed in an old forest by Catherwood and Stephens.

No one can"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"decipher the weird A L AND OF M YSTERY  323 hierogl y phical inscriptions on the altars and monoliths. With the exception of a few works of uncut stone, “to Copán we may safely assign an antiquity higher than to any of the other monuments of Central America with which we are acquainted,” says the New American Cyclopaedia . At the period of the Spanish conquest, Copán was already a forgotten ruin, concerning which existed only the vaguest traditions. No less extraordinary are the remains of the different epochs in Peru. The ruins of the temple of the Sun at Cuzco are yet imposing, notwithstanding that the deprecating hand of the Vandal Spaniard passed heavily over it. If we may believe the narratives of the conquerors themselves, they found it, on their arrival, a kind of a fairy-tale castle. With its enormous circular stone wall completely encompassing the principal temple, chapels and buildings, it is situated in the very heart of the city, and even its remains justly provoke the admiration of the traveller. “Aqueducts opened within this sacred enclosure; and within it were gardens, and walks among shrubs and flowers of gold and silver , made in imitation of the productions of nature. It was attended by 4,000 priests.” “The ground,” says La Vega, “for 200 paces around the temple, was considered holy, and no one was allowed to pass within this boundary but with naked feet.” Besides this great temple, there were 300 other inferior temples at Cuzco. Next to the latter in beauty, was the celebrated temple of Pachacamac. Still another great temple of the Sun is mentioned by Humboldt; and, “at the base of the hill of Cannar was formerly a famous shrine of the Sun, consisting of the universal symbol of that luminary, formed by nature upon the face of a great rock.” Roman tells us that “the temples of Peru were built upon high grounds or the tops of hills, and were surrounded by four circular embankments of earth, one within the other.” Other remains seen by myself—especially mounds—are surrounded by two, three, and four circles of stones. Near the town of Cayambe, on the very spot on which A. de Ulloa saw and described an ancient Peruvian temple “perfectly circular in form and open at the top,” there are several 324  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS such cromlechs . * Quoti ng from an article in the Madras Times of 1876, Mr. J.

Mr. Heath’s conclusions, more startling, perchance, than his discoveries, are worthy of being recorded. We will repeat in brief his descriptions:— Take for instance the Jequetepeque valley. In 7° 24’ south latitude you will find on recent maps the port of P acasmayo. Four miles north, separated from it by a barren waste, the river Jequetepeque empties into the sea. . . . Beside the southern shore as it empties into the sea, is an elevated platform one-fourth of a mile square and forty feet high, all of adobes. A wall fifty feet wide connects it with another, a few hundred yards east and south, that is 150 feet high, 200 feet across the top, and 500 at the base, nearly square. This latter was built in sections of room ten feet square at the base, six feet at the top and about eight feet high. All of this same class of mounds—temples, to worship the sun, or fortresses, as they may be—have on the north side an incline for an entrance or means of access. Treasure-seekers have cut into this one about half way, and it is said $150,000 worth of gold and silver ornaments were found. In the sand, banked up behind the wall and mound, many were buried. . . . Besides these were many ornaments of gold, silver, copper, coral and shell beads and cloths.

In one large stone there are three holes, twenty to thirty inches deep, six inches in diameter at the orifice and two at the apex. . . . . . .

The secret was revealed to me by a Peruvian. At Arica, going from Lima, there stands an enormous rock, which tradition points to as the tomb of the Incas. As the last rays of the setting sun strike the face of the rock, one can see curious hieroglyphics inscribed upon it. These characters form one of the landmarks that show how to get at the immense treasures buried in subterranean corridors. The details are given in Isis , and I will not repeat them. Strong corroborative evidence is now found in more than one recent scientific work; and the statement may be less pooh-poohed now than it was then. . . . . . Eleven miles beyond Yonan, on a ridge of mountain seven hundred feet above the river, are the walls of a city of 2,000 inhabitants. . . . Six and twelve miles further are extensive walls and terraces. . . . .

It is the house which the Inca “promised to fill with gold as high as he could reach, in exchang e for his liberty” in 1532; he did fill it with 17,500,000 dollars’ worth of gold, and so kept his promise. But Pizarro, the ancient swineherd of Spain and the worthy acolyte of the priest Hernando de Lugues, murdered him, notwithstanding his pledge of honour. . . . .

F IRST.—In Truxillo, Peru, on the 22nd of July, 1577, Don Garcia Gutierrez de Toledo presented himself at th e royal treasury, to give into the royal chest a fifth. He brought a bar of gold nineteen carats ley and weighing two thousand four hundred Spanish dollars, of which the fifth, being seven hundred and eight dollars, together with one and a half per cent. to the chief assayer, were deposited in the royal box.

E IGHTH.—On the same day he came back with another portion of gold and ornaments of cornheads and pieces of effigies of animals, weighing four thousand seven hundred and four dollars. The sum of these eight bringings amounted to 278,174 gold dollars or Spanish ounces. Multiplied by sixteen gives $4,450,784 silver dollars. Deducting the royal fifth—$985,953.75—left $3,464,830.25 as Toledo’s portion. Even after this great haul, effigies of different animals of gold were found from time to time. Mantles also, adorned with square pieces of gold, as well as robes made with feathers of divers colors, were dug up. There is a tradition that in the huaca of Toledo there were two treasures, known as the great and little fish. The smaller only has been found. Between Huacho and Supe, the latter being 120 miles north of Callao, near a point called Atahuanqui, there are two enormous mounds, resembling the Campana and San Miguel, of the Huatica valley, soon to be described. About five miles from Patavilca (south and near Supe) is a place called “Paramonga,” or the fortress. The ruins of a fortress of great extent are here visible; the walls are of tempered clay, about six feet thick. The principal building stood on an eminence, but the walls were continued to the foot of it, like regular circumvallations; the ascent winding round the hill like a labyrinth, having many angles, which probably served as outworks to defend the place. In this neighbourhood much treasure has been excavated, all of which must have been concealed by the pre-historic Indian, as we have no evidence of the Incas ever having occupied this part of Peru after they had subdued it. . . . . . Just before reaching Ancón, the railroad runs through an immense burying-ground or “huaca.” Make a circuit of six to eight miles, and on every side you see skulls, legs, arms, and the whole skeleton of the human body, lying about in the sand. . . . . At Pasamayo, 14 miles further “down north,” on the seashore, is another great burying ground. Thousands of skeletons lie about, thrown out by the treasure-seekers. It has more than a half mile of cutting through it for the Ancón & Chankay R.R. It extends up the face of the hill from the seashore to the height of about 800 feet. . . . . . . . . . . Whence came these hundreds and thousands of peoples who are buried at Ancón? . . . Time and time again the archaeologist finds himself face to face with such questions, to which he can only shrug his shoulders and say with the natives, “Quién sabe?” Who knows? . . . . A L AND OF M YSTERY  329 Dr. Hutchinson writes, under date of Oct. 30th, 1872, in an article to the Callao and Lima Gazette , now the South Pacific Times : “I am come to the conclusion that Chankay is a great city of the dead, or has"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"been an immense usury of Peru; for go where you will, on mountain top or level plain, or by the sea-side, you meet at every turn, skulls and boner, of all descriptions.”* In the Huatica Valley, which is an extensive ruin, there are seventeen mounds, called “huacas,” although, remarks the writer, “they present more the form of fortresses, residences or castles, than burying-grounds.” A triple wall surrounded the city. These walls are often three yards in thickness and from fifteen to twenty feet high. To the east of these is the enormous mound called Huaca of Pando; and to the west, with the distance of abou t half a mile intervening, are the great ruins of fortresses, which natives entitle Huaca of the Bell. La Campana, the Huacas of Pando, consisting of a series of large and small mounds, and extending over a stretch of ground incalculable without being measured, form a colossal accumulation. The principal large ones are three in number; that holding the name of the “Bell” is calculated to be 108 to 110 feet in height. At the western side, looking towards Callao, there is a square plateau . . . . At the summit it is 276 to 278 yards, long, and 95 to 96 across. On the top there are eight gradations of declivity, each from one to two yards lower than its neighbor . . . making the total of about 278 yards. For these measurements of the Huatica ruins I am indebted to the notes of J. B. Steere, Professor of Natural History and Curator of the Museum at Ann Arbor, Michigan. The square plateau first mentioned, at the base, consists of two divisions . . . each measuring a perfect square 47 to 48 yards; the two joining, form the square of 96 yards. Besides this . . . . is another square of 47 to 48 yards. On the top, returning again, we find the same symmetry of measurement in the multiples of twelve, nearly all the ruins in this valley being the same, which is a fact for the curious. Was it by accident or design? . . . The mound is a truncated pyramidal form, and is calculated to contain a mass of 14,641,820 cubic feet of material . . . The “Fortress” is a huge structure, 80 feet high, 148 to 150 yards in measurement. Great large square rooms show their outlines on the top, but are filled with earth. Who brought this earth here, and with what object was the filling-up accomplished? The work of obliterating all space in these rooms with loose earth must have been almost as great as the construction of the building itself. . . . Two miles south . . . we find another similar structure . . . more spacious and with a greater number of apartments. . . . –––––––––– * [Heath, o p . c it . , p p. 458-60.] –––––––––– 330  B LAVAT SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS It is nea r ly 170 yards in length, and 168 in breadth, and 98 feet high. The whole of these ruins . . . were enclosed by high walls of adobones . . . large mud-bricks, some from 1 to 2 yards in thickness, length, and breadth. The huaca of the “Bell” contains about 20,220,840 cubic feet of material, while that of “San Miguel” has 25,650,800. These two buildings were constructed in the same style—having traces of terraces, parapets, and bastions, with a large number of rooms and squares—all now filled up with earth. About a mile beyond, in the direction of “Mira Flores,” is Ocharan—the largest burial mound in the Huatica valley . . . It has 95 feet of elevation and a width of 55 yards on the summit, and a total length of 428 yards, or 1,284 feet, another multiple of twelve . It is enclosed by a double wall 816 yards in length by 700 across, thus enclosing 117 acres. Between Ocharan and the ocean are from 15 to 20 masses of ruins, like those already described. . . . . . . . the Inca temple of the Sun, like the temple of Cholula on the plains of Mexico . . . . is a sort of vast terraced pyramid of earth. It is from 200 to 300 feet high, and forms a semi-lunar shape that is beyond a half mile in extent. Its top measures about 10 acres square. Much of the walls are washed over with red paint, probably ochre, and are as fresh and bright as when centuries ago it was first put on . . . In the Cañete valley, opposite the Chincha Guano Islands, are extensive ruins [described by Squier]. . . . From the"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"hill called “Hill of Gold,” copper and silver pins were taken like those used by ladies to pin their shawls; also tweezers for pulling out the hair of the eyebrows, eyelids and whiskers, as well as silver cups. * The coast of Peru [says Mr. Heath], extends from Tumbes to the river Loa on the south, a distance of 1,235 miles. Scattered here and there over this whole extent, there are thousands of ruins beside those just mentioned . . . while nearly every hill and spur of the mountains have upon them or about them some relic of the past; and in every ravine, from the coast to the central plateau, there are ruins of walls, fortresses, cities, burial-vaults, and miles and miles of terraces and water-courses. Across the plateau and down the eastern slope of the Andes to the home of the wild Indian, and into the unknown, impenetrable forest, still you find them. . . . In the mountains, however, where storms of rain and snow with terrific thunder and lightning are nearly constant a number of months each year, the ruins are different. Of granitic, porphyritic, lime and silicated sandstone, these massive, colossal, cyclopean structures have resisted the disintegration of time, geological transformations, earthquakes, and the sacrilegious, destructive hand of the warrior and treasure-seeker. The masonry composing these walls, temples, houses, towers, –––––––––– * [Heath, op . cit ., pp . 461-63.] –––––––––– A L AND OF M YST ERY  331 fortresses, or sepulchres, is uncemented, held in place by the incline of the walls from the perpendicular, and ada p tation of each stone to the place destined for it, the stones having from six to many sides, each dressed, and smoothed to fit another or others, with such exactness that the blade of a small penknife cannot be inserted in any of the seams thus formed, whether in the central parts entirely hidden, or on the internal or external surfaces. These stones, selected with no reference to uniformity in shape or size, vary from one-half cubic foot to 1,500 cubic feet solid contents, and if, in the many , many millions of stones you could find one that would fit in the place of another, it would be purely accidental. In “Triumph Street,” in the city of Cuzco, in a part of the wall of the ancient house of the Virgins of the Sun, is a very large stone, known as “the stone of the twelve corners,” since it joins with those that surround it, by twelve faces, each having a different angle. Beside these twelve faces it has its external one, and no one knows how many it has on its back that is hidden in the masonry. In the wall of the centre of the Cuzco fortress there are stones 13 feet high, 15 feet long, and 8 feet thick, and all having been quarried miles away. Near this city there is an oblong smooth boulder 18 feet in its longer axis, and 12 in its lesser. On one side are large niches cut out, in which a man can stand, and by swaying his body cause the stone to rock. These niches apparently were made solely for this purpose. One of the most wonderful and extensive of these works in stone, is that called Ollantaytambo, a ruin situated 30 miles north of Cuzco, in a narrow ravine on the bank of the river Urubamba. It consists of a fortress constructed on the top of a sloping, craggy eminence. Extending from it to the plain below, is a stony stairway. At the top of the stairway are six large slabs, 12 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 3 feet thick, side by side, having between them and on top narrow strips of stone about 6 inches wide, framed as it were to the slabs, and all being of dressed stone. At the bottom of the hill, part of which was made by hand, and at the foot of the stairs, a stone wall 10 feet wide and 12 feet high extends some distance into the plain. In it are many niches, all facing the south. The ruins on the islands in Lake Titicaca, where Incal history begins, have often been described. At Tiahuanaco, a few miles south of the lake, there are stones in the form of columns, partly dressed, placed in line at certain distances from each other, and having an elevation above the ground of from 18 to 20 feet. In this same line there is a monolithic doorway, now broken, 10 feet high by 13 wide. The space cut out for the door is 7 feet 4 inches high, by 3 feet 2 inches wide. The whole face of the stone above the door is engraved. Another, similar, but smaller, lies on the ground beside it. These stones are of hard porphyry, and differ geologically from the surrounding rock, hence, we infer they must have been brought from elsewhere. At “Chavin de Huanta,” a town in the province of Huari, there are"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"332  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS some ruin s worthy of note. The entrance to them is by an alleyway 6 feet wide and 9 feet high, roofed over with sandstone partly dressed, of more than 12 feet in length. On each side there are rooms 12 feet wide, roofed by large pieces of sandstones, 1½ feet thick and from 6 to 9 feet wide. The walls of the rooms are 6 feet thick, and have some loopholes in them, probably for ventilation. In the floor of this passage there is a very narrow entrance to a subterranean passage that passes beneath the river to the other side. From this many huacas, stone drinking-vessels, instruments of copper and silver, and a skeleton of an Indian sitting, were taken. The greater part of these ruins are situated over aqueducts. The bridge to these castles is made of three stones of dressed granite, 24 feet long, 2 feet wide by 1½ thick. Some of the granite stones are covered with hieroglyphics. At Corralones, 24 miles from Arequipa, there are hieroglyphics engraved on masses of granite, which appear as if painted with chalk. There are figures of men, llamas, circles, parallelograms, letters as an R and an O and even remains of a system of astronomy. At Huaitará, in the province of Castrovirreina, there is an edifice with the same engravings. At Nazca, in the province of Ica, there are some wonderful ruins of aqueducts, four to five feet high and 3 feet wide, very straight, double-walled, of unfinished stone, flagged on top. At Quelap, not far from Chochapayas, there have lately been examined some extensive works. A wall of dressed stone 560 feet wide, 3,660 long, and 150 feet high. The lower part is solid. Another wall above this has 600 feet length, 500 width, and the same elevation of 150 feet. There are niches over both walls, three feet long, one-and-a-half wide and thick, containing the remains of those ancient inhabitants, some naked, others enveloped in shawls of cotton of distinct colours and well embroidered. . . . Following the entrances of the second and highest wall, there are other sepulchres like small ovens, six feet high and twenty-four in circumference; in their base are flags, upon which some cadavers reposed. On the north side there is, on the perpendicular rocky side of the mountain, a brick wall, having small windows 600 feet from the bottom. No reason for this, nor means of approach, can now be found. The skillful construction of utensils of gold and silver that were found here, the ingenuity and solidity of this gigantic work of dressed stone, made it, also, probably of pre-Incal date. . . . Estimating five hundred ravines in the 1,200 miles of Peru, and ten miles of terraces of fifty tiers to each ravine, which would only be five miles of twenty-five tiers to each side, we have 250,000 miles of stone wall, averaging three to four feet high—enough to encircle this globe ten times. Surprising as these estimates may seem, I am fully convinced that an actual measurement would more than double them, for these ravines vary from 30 to 100 miles in length, and ten miles to each is a low estimate.

Nor again, must we f o rget that the temples of heathendom were odious to the narrow bigotry of the Roman Catholic fanatics of those days; and that, whenever the chance offered, they either converted them into Christian churches or razed them to the ground. Another strong objection to the idea lies in the fact that the Incas were destitute of a written language, and that these antique relics of bygone ages are covered with hieroglyphics. “It is granted that the Temple of the Sun, at Cuzco, was of Incal make, but that is the latest of the five styles of architecture visible in the Andes, each probably representing an age of human progress.”* The hieroglyphics of Peru and Central America have been, are, and will most probably remain for ever as dead a letter to our cryptographers as they were to the Incas. The latter, like the barbarous ancient Chinese and Mexicans, kept their records by means of a quipus (or knot in Peruvian)—a cord, several feet long, composed of different coloured threads, from which a multicoloured fringe was suspended; each colour denoting a sensible object, and knots serving as ciphers. “The mysterious science of the quipus,” says Prescott, “supplied the Peruvians with the means of communicating their ideas to one another, and of transmitting them to future generations . . . † Each locality, however, had its own method of interpreting these elaborate records, hence a quipus was"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"only intelligible in the place where it was kept. “Many quipus have been taken from the graves, in excellent state of preservation in colour and texture,” writes Dr. Heath; “but the lips that alone could pronounce the verbal key, have for ever ceased their function, and the relic-seeker has failed to note the exact spot each was found, so that the records which could tell so much we want to know, will remain sealed till all is revealed at the last day,‡ . . . if anything at all is revealed then. –––––––––– * [Heath, op . cit ., p . 467.] † [ Hist . of the Conquest of Peru , Chap.

It is the almost irrepressible conviction that man having existed upon earth millions of years—for all we know—the theory of cycles is the only plausible theory to solve the great problems of humanity, the rise and fall of numberless nations and races, and the ethnological differences among the latter. This difference—which, though as marked as the one between a handsome and intellectual European and a digger Indian of Australia, yet makes the ignorant shudder and raise a great outcry at the thought of destroying the imaginary “great gulf between man and brute creation”—might thus be well accounted for. The digger Indian, then in company with many other savage, though to him superior nations, which evidently are dying out to afford room to men and races of a superior kind, would have to be regarded in the same light as so many dying-out specimens of animals—and no more. Who can tell but that the forefathers of this flat-headed savage—forefathers who may have lived and prospered amidst the highest civilization before the glacial period—were in the arts and sciences far beyond those of the present civilization—though it may be in quite another direction? That man has lived in America, at least 50,000 years ago, is now proved scientifically and remains a fact beyond doubt or cavil. In a lecture delivered at Manchester, in June last, by Mr. H. A. All-butt, Honorary Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Society, the lecturer stated the following:— Near New Orleans, in one part of the modern delta, in excavating for gas works, a series of beds, almost wh o lly made up of vegetable matter, were dug through. In the excavation, at a depth of 16 feet from the upper surface, and beneath four buried forests, one on the top of the other, the labourers discovered some charcoal and the skeleton of a man, the cranium of which was reported to be that of the type of the aboriginal Red Indian race. To this skeleton Dr. Dowler ascribed an antiquity of some 50,000 years.

Why should man be the only specimen upon earth which has never changed in form since the first day of his appearance upon this planet? The fancied superiority of every generation of mankind over the preceding one is not yet so well established as to make it impossible for us to learn some day that, as in everything else, the theory is a two-sided question—incessant progress on the one side and an as irresistible decadence on the other of the cycle. “Even as regards knowledge and power, the advance which some claim as a characteristic feature of humanity is effected by exceptional individuals who arise in certain races under favourable circumstances only, and is quite compatible with long intervals of immobility, and even of decline ,” says a modern man of science.* This point is corroborated by what we see in the modern degenerate descendants of the great and powerful races of ancient America—the Peruvians and the Mexicans. How changed! How fallen from their greatness must have been the Incas when a little band of one hundred and sixty men could penetrate uninjured to their mountain homes, murder their worshipped Icings and thousands of their warriors, and carry away their riches, and that, too, in a country where a few men with stones could resist successfully an army!

Great nations split, scatter into small tribes, lose all remembrance of their integrity, gradually fall into their primitive state and—disappear, one after the other, from the face of the earth. So do great continents. Ceylon must have formed, once upon a time, part of the Indian continent. So, to all appearances, was Spain once joined to Africa, the narrow channel between Gibraltar and the latter continent having been once upon a time dry land. Gibraltar is full of large apes of the same kind as those which are found in great numbers on the opposite side on the African coast, whereas nowhere in Spain is either a monkey or ape to be found at any place whatever. And the caves of Gibraltar are also full of gigantic human bones, supporting the theory that they belong to an antediluvian race of men. The same Dr. Heath mentions the town of Eten in 7° S. Latitude of America, in which the inhabitants of an unknown tribe of men speak a monosyllabic language that imported Chinese labourers understood from the first day of their arrival. They have their own laws, customs and dress, neither holding nor permitting communication with the outside world.

P. B. refers, in connection with the Incas gold and the mysterious hieroglyphics upon a certain rock, is as follows: “The ruins which cover both Americas, and are found on many West Indian islands, are all attributed to the submerged Atlanteans. As well as the hierophants of the old world, which in the days of Atlantis was almost connected with the new one by land, the magicians of the new submerged country had a network of subterranean passages running in all directions. In connection with those mysterious catacombs, we will now give a curious story told to us by a Peruvian, long since dead, as we were travelling together in the interior of his country. There must be truth in it; as it was afterward confirmed to us by an Italian gentleman who had seen the place and who, but for lack of means and time, would have verified the tale himself, at least partially. The informant of the Italian was an old priest, who had had the secret divulged to him, at confession, by a Peruvian Indian. We may add, moreover, that the priest was compelled to make the revelation, being at the time completely under the mesmeric influence of the traveller. “The story concerns the famous treasures of the last of the Incas. The Peruvian asserted that since the well-known and miserable murder of the latter by Pizarro, the secret had been known to all the Indians, except the Mestizos who could not be trusted. It runs thus: The Inca was made prisoner, and his wife offered for his liberation a room full of gold, ‘from the floor up to the ceiling, as high up as his conqueror could reach,’ before the sun would set on the third day. She kept her promise, but Pizarro broke his word, according to Spanish practice. Marvelling at the exhibition of such treasures, the conqueror declared that he would not release the prisoner, but would murder him, unless the Queen revealed the place whence the treasure came. He had heard that the Incas had somewhere an inexhaustible mine; a subterranean road or tunnel running many miles underground, where were kept the accumulated riches of the country. The unfortunate Queen begged for delay, and 340  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS went to c o nsult the oracles. During the sacrifice, the chief-priest showed her in the consecrated ‘black mirror’ the unavoidable murder of her husband, whether she delivered the treasures of the crown to Pizarro or not. Then the Queen gave the order to close the entrance, which was a door cut in the rocky wall of a chasm. Under the direction of the priest and magicians, the chasm was accordingly filled to the top with huge masses of rock, and the surface covered over so as to conceal the work. The Inca was murdered by the Spaniards and his unhappy Queen committed suicide. Spanish greed overreached itself and the secret of the buried treasures was locked in the breasts of a few faithful Peruvians. “Our Peruvian informant added that in consequence of certain indiscretions at various times, persons had been sent by different governments to search for the treasure under the pretext of scientific exploration. They had rummaged the country through, but without realizing their object. So far this tradition is corroborated by the reports of Dr. Tschudi and other historians of Peru. But there are certain additional details which we are not aware have been made public before now. “Several years after hearing the story, and its corroboration by the Italian gentleman, we again visited"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Peru. Going southward from Lima, by water, we reached a point near Arica at sunset, and were struck by the appearance of an enormous rock, nearly perpendicular, which stood in mournful solitude on the shore, apart from the range of the Andes. It was the tomb of the Incas. As the last rays of the setting sun strike the face of the rock, one can make out, with an ordinary opera-glass, some curious hieroglyphics inscribed on the volcanic surface. “When Cuzco was the capital of Peru, it contained a temple of the sun, famed far and near for its magnificence. It was roofed with thick plates of gold, and the walls were covered with the same precious metal; the eave-troughs were also of solid gold. In the west wall the architects had contrived an aperture in such a way that when the sunbeams reached it, it focused them inside the building. Stretching like a golden chain from one sparkling point to another, they encircled the walls, illuminating the grim idols, and disclosing certain mystic signs at other times invisible. It was only by understanding these hieroglyphics—identical with those which may be seen to this day on the tomb of the Incas—that one could learn the secret of the tunnel and its approaches. Among the latter was one in the neighborhood of Cuzco, now masked beyond discovery. This leads directly into an immense tunnel which runs from Cuzco to Lima, and then, turning southward, extends A PPENDIX BY THE C OMPILER  341 into Bolivia. At a certain point it is intersected by a royal tomb. Inside this sepulchral chamber are c u n n in g ly arranged two doors; or rather, two enormous slabs which turn upon pivots, and close so tightly as to be only distinguishable from the other portions of the sculptured walls by the secret signs, whose key is in the possession of the faithful custodians. One of these turning slabs covers the southern mouth of the Liman tunnel—the other, the northern one of the Bolivian corridor. The latter, running southward, passes through Tarapaca and Cobija, for Arica is not far away from the little river called Pay’quina,* which is the boundary between Peru and Bolivia. “Not far from this spot stand three separate peaks which form a curious triangle; they are included in the chain of the Andes. According to tradition the only practicable entrance to the corridor leading northward is in one of these peaks; but without the secret of its landmarks, a regiment of Titans might rend the rocks in vain in the attempt to find it. But even were someone to gain an entrance and find his way as far as the turning slab in the wall of the sepulchre, and attempt to blast it out, the superincumbent rocks are so disposed as to bury the tomb, its treasures, and—as the mysterious Peruvian expressed it to us—’a thousand warriors’ in one common ruin. There is no other access to the Arica chamber but through the door in the mountain near Pay’quina. Along the entire length of the corridor, from Bolivia to Lima and Cuzco, are smaller hiding-places filled with treasures of gold and precious stones, the accumulation of many generations of Incas, the aggregate value of which is incalculable. “We have in our possession an accurate plan of the tunnel, the sepulchre, and the doors, given to us at the time by the old Peruvian. If we had ever thought of profiting by the secret, it would have required the co-operation of the Peruvian and Bolivian governments on an extensive scale. To say nothing of physical obstacles, no one individual or small party could undertake such an exploration without encountering the army of smugglers and brigands with which the coast is infested; and which, in fact, includes nearly the whole population. The mere task of purifying the mephitic air of the tunnel, which had not been entered for centuries, would also be a serious one. There, however, the treasure lies, and there the tradition says it will lie till the last vestige –––––––––– * Pay’quina or Payaquin a , s o called because its waves used to drift particles of gold from Brazil.

While no “accurate plan of the tunnel, the sepulchre, and the doors” mentioned by H. P. B. has ever been found among her papers, there is nevertheless a curious document in the Archives of The Theosophical Society at Adyar, which it has been thought advisable to include in the present Volume. This document consists of a folded sheet of foolscap containing drawings and writings on three of its four pages. At the top of the front page appear two separate inscriptions. One of them reads: “For those I love and protect. Try.” It is signed by H. Moore. This, in spite of the spelling, could very well be Henry More (1614-1687), the famous English Platonist of the Cambridge school, whose collaboration in the writing of Isis Unveiled is described by Col. Olcott (see Old Diary Leaves , I, 237-39). It might be tempting to think of this signature as being that of an initiate who signed himself as Robert More on a letter addressed to Col. Olcott by the Brotherhood of Luxor (see Letters from the Masters of the Wisdom , Second Series, Letter No. 3), were it not again for the different spelling of the name and for the fact that the initial looks more like a capital H. The other short sentence is in the old-fashioned script-type used by John King and is signed by him, advising “to ponder and discuss.” On the side of these brief sentences and somewhat below them is a drawing of the West Coast of South America, showing a number of coastal and inland towns, as well as the former boundary line between Peru and Bolivia. At the side of the map and below it are explanatory notes and a sketch. Some have thought the notes to be in H. P. B.’s handwriting, but this is hardly so, especially as they are in a rather peculiar and ungrammatical mixture of French and Italian which would be most unlikely in H. P. B.’s case, as she spoke both languages fluently. One short line is in English, and one other in some script which might be Oriental. The towns and other geographical localities on the map are: Guayaquil, Trujillo, Callao, Lima, Ayacucho, Cuzco (“ancient capital of the Incas”), Pisco, the Island of Chincha, Aucari, Caraveli, Arequipa, Arica; and farther down Tarapaca, Iquique and Cobija The Payequina (or Pay’quina) river is said to cross the dividing line between Bolivia and Peru, and to carry particles of gold from Brazil. Under the sketch, the explanatory note says that this is a rock cut perpendicularly with hieroglyphics, and in the interior of which is the tomb of the Inca Kings. The last third of the front page and the whole of the second are A PPENDIX BY THE C OMPILER  343 occupie d with a text in a peculiar Italian, the approximate translation of which is given below: “This was confided to me about fifteen years ago by an old priest in Peru who makes journeys into the in te rior, and who told me this secret, which had been disclosed to him by an Indian at confession, who said it had been revealed to him by his parents. It concerned the famous mine where they found the gold which the Spaniards carried off soon after the conquest of Peru. “I was told that the last King of the Incas having been taken prisoner by Pizarro, there was offered for his ransom a room full of gold, which they got in three days. Pizarro, astounded by so much treasure, would only release the imprisoned King on condition that they would tell from what mine the treasure came. The Queen gave the order to close the ventilating shafts of the great tunnel, so that the mine should be for ever lost to the rapacious Spaniards. After much search by commissions from various nations and by naturalists, it still remains an impenetrable secret. “By a strange coincidence it happened that, after this secret had been communicated to me while travelling with the priest, I arrived, as the sun was setting, at Arica; a hill or high rock perpendicular"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"on the side facing the sea showed that it had on it some hieroglyphics, of which I could get no explanation from the same priest.

Inside the mortuary chambers are said to be two closed doors, difficult to discover; one opens into the tunnel that goes to Cuzco, and the door opposite leads towards Bolivia, passing through Tarapaca and Cobija. On the boundary between Peru and Bolivia there is a river which is called Pay’quina, and in this area there are three hills in a triangle (a continuation of the chain of the Andes). In one of these three hills—I cannot now remember which—about half way up, is the door to the end of the tunnel.” On the fourth page of the document a range of mountains is shown as seen from the sea, giving the location of various coastal towns and the line of the tunnels mentioned in the text.

An eloquent and famous American preacher once said, in an address upon the Fine Arts, that he never could see an Italian image vendor enter a poor man’s cabin without feeling that he ought to lift his hat to him as to a real missionary of Art.

This was a great truth that the preacher uttered, and recalls the old familiar proverb, “Despise not the day of small things.” Some of the world’s greatest discoveries have resulted from the chance observation of some trifling fact that had previously been passed over with ignorant indifference. Who knows, for instance, what a flood of light may not be thrown upon the history of mankind by a recent discovery announced by Mr. Rivett-Carnac—a discovery hitherto not sufficiently appreciated; certainly not as it ought to be. The description given by Sir James Simpson, Bart., of the cup-like markings on stones and rocks in Scotland, England, and other countries of the West struck him as offering an “extraordinary resemblance” –––––––––– * [The same subject is discussed in a long footnote in The Sec r et Doctrine , Vol. II, p. 346.— Compiler .] –––––––––– C UP -M ARK I NSCRIPTIONS  347 to the marks on the trap boulders which encircled the Barrows near Nagpur . . .

He abstained from putting forward any theories founded upon this striking resembl a nce, but affirmed that the cup-marks formed another and very extraordinary addition to the mass of evidence which already existed in favour of"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"the view, that a branch of the nomadic tribes who swept, at an early date, over Europe, penetrated into India also. There is so much more involved in Mr. Rivett-Carnac’s discovery and the theory he propound s than could possibly be discussed in the space that is at our present disposal that we refrain. The world’s history is yet to be written, and it rests with scholars like Mr. Rivett-Carnac to furnish the alphabet in which its pages are to be traced. We must first scuttle Noah’s Ark and drown those fabulous sons who have served so useful a purpose to the pious ethnographers in search of progenitors for the races of mankind, and then the ground will be cleared for the real historian to build upon. There can be no true archaeology among Christian nations until the last remnant of superstitious reliance upon Biblical chronology and history is swept away.

The Decc a n Star , noticing a book written by the Conductor of this magazine, called it “ Ices Unveiled”; in printing, last month, the Viceroy’s letter to us, the compositor made Mr. Batten say he had submitted three of our members , instead of numbers, to His Excellency; and, instead of allowing one of our metaphysical contributors to write about developing the inner or spiritual Ego, compelled the unhappy man to appear anxious to develop the spiritual eggs . Finally, the sober Oriental Miscellany of Calcutta, for February, comes pirating to us about the true spiritual philosopher uniting himself to the Scul of the Universe! If anything more dearly justifying compositorcide than these can be shown, let us know it by all means. Another error, not at all ludicrous but very annoying was the conversion of the Hon. George H. M. Batten’s official title from Personal Assistant into Personal Attendant of His Excellency the Viceroy. We trust that the stupid blunder may be excused. 350  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS That witty and epigrammatic journal, the Bombay Review , h a s f a v oured us with several friendly notices, for which it merits, and will kindly accept, our best thanks. But one remark upon our February number must not pass without rejoinder. It says “ The Theosophist ’ s ghost stories we have noted once and forever—they make very uncanny reading.” They do, if taken only in one sense; and the less one has of ghost stories in general, judging from that point of view, the better. If they were only meant to feed the morbid fancies of sentimental novel readers, their room might well be thought better than their company. But, since they appear in a magazine professedly devoted to a serious enquiry into questions of science and religion, it is not unreasonable to presume that the editors have a definite purpose to show their connection with one or both of these departments of research. Such, at any rate, is the fact. Before we have done with our readers, it will be made very clear that every story of ghost, goblin, and bhûta , admitted into our columns, has the value of an illustration of some one phase of that misconceived but most important science, Psychology.

Implored by the Slavs to come and reign over their country, Rurik is reported to have been addressed by the delegates in these ominous words: “Come with us, great prince, . . . for vast is our motherland; but there is little order in it”—words which their descendants might well repeat with as much, if not more, propriety now as then. Accepting the invitation, Rurik came in A.D. 861 to Novgorod, with his two brothers, and laid the foundation of Russian nationality. The “Rurikovitch,” then, are the descendants of this prince, his two brothers and his son, Igor, the line running through a long succession of princes and chiefs of principalities. The reigning house of Rurik became extinct at the death of Fedor, the son of Ivan the Terrible. After a period of anarchy, the Romanoffs, a family of petty nobles, came into power. But, as this was only in 1613, it was not without reason that the Prince P.

Besides these conflicting elements of high and low nobility, the direct descendants of the Boyars of old—the Slavonian peers in the palmy days of Russia, divided in petty sovereignties, who chose for themselves the prince they wanted to serve and left him at will, who were vassals, not the subjects, had their own military retinue, and without whose approval no grand-ducal “ukase” could be of any avail—and the ennobled chinovniks , sons of priests and petty traders, there are yet to be considered 79,000,000 of other people. These may be divided into the millions of liberated serfs (22,000,000), of crown peasants (16,000,000), and of town peasants (about 10,000,000), who inhabit cities, preferring various trades and menial service to agriculture. The rest comprise (1) the meshtchanis , or petty bourgeois, one step higher than the peasant; (2) the enormous body of merchants and traders divided into three guilds; (3) the hereditary citizens, who have nothing to do with nobility; (4) the black clergy or the monks and nuns; and the secular clergy, or married priest—a caste apart and hereditary; and (5) the military class. We will not include in our classification the 3,000,000 of Mohammedans, the 2,000,000 of Jews, the 250,000 Buddhists, the pagan Izors, the Savakots, and the Karels, who seem perfectly well satisfied with the Russian rule, T HE H ISTORY OF A “B OOK ”  357 t h o r o u g h ly tolerant to their various worships.* These, with the exception of the higher educated Jews and some fanatical Mohammedans, care little as to the hand that rules them.

How far it would be possible to effect a complete revolution throughout the Russian Empire, may well be a subject of conjecture. With so little to bind the many nationalities into one movement, it would seem to a foreigner an undertaking so hopeless as to discourage even an Internationalist or a Nihilist. Add to this the unquestionable devotion of the liberated serfs and peasantry to the Czar, in whom they see alike the benefactor of the oppressed, and the vicegerent of God, the head of their Church, and the case seems yet more problematical. At the same time, we must not forget the lessons of history, which has more than once shown us how the very vastness of an empire, and lack of a common unity among its subjects have proved at some supreme crisis the most potent elements of its disruption. The heart of Russia beats at Moscow, though the brain plots at St. Petersburg; and any movement to be successful must carry these two centres.

It lazily nods, only now and then open ing its lifeless eyes, as might one, who, after a heavy dinner, forced to sit in an unnatural position, cannot resist a lethargic drowsiness, and feels that he must either unbutton his uniform and draw a full breath, or—suffocate. But the dinner is an official one, and his body pinched in a State uniform too tight for him The man is overcome with an irresistible somnolence; he feels the blood rushing to his head, his legs tremble and his hand mechanically fumbles the buttons of his uniform to get one gasp of breath that would interrupt the unendurable torture. Such is the present condition of our society. But while it is nodding under its threatened apoplexy, from a surfeit of indigestible food, those carnivorous jackals, who are always ready to eat and drink, and can digest whatever they pick up, do not sleep. The violation of the seventh commandment, intellectually as well as physically, having debased body, mind, and soul, is nestling in the very heart of the public. Adulterers of body, adulterers of thought, adulterers of knowledge and science, adulterers of labour—reign in our midst, are creeping out from every side as the representatives of society and the public, boasting of their brazen hardihood, successful wherever they go, having flung away all shame, cast aside to at least conceal the nakedness of their deeds, even from the eyes of those upon whom they speculate, from whom they squeeze all that can be squeezed, only from such a fool as—man. Government and treasury pilferers; embezzlers of public and private properties; blacklegs and swindlers subsidized by numberless bubble companies, by stock companies and fraudulent enterprises; thimble-riggers and violators of women and children whom they debauch and ruin; contractors, money-lenders, bribed judges and venal counsel, bucket-shop keepers and sharpers of all nationalities, every religion, every social class— this is our modern social force. Like beasts of prey, hunting in packs, this force, gloating over its quarry, satiating itself, noisily crunching its restless, tireless jaws, imposing itself upon everyone, dares to offer itself as the patron of everything—science, literature, arts, and even thought itself. There it is, the kingdom of this world, flesh of the flesh , blood of the blood, made in the image of the animal from which the first germ of man evoluted. Such are the social ethics of our contemporary Russia, on Russian testimony. If so, then it m u st have reached that culminating point from which it must either fall into the T HE H ISTORY OF A “B OOK ”  359"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"mire of dissolution, like old Rome, or gravitate towards regeneration through all the horrors and chaos of a “Reign of Terror.” The press teems with guarded complaints of “prostration of forces” among its representatives, the chronic signs of fast-impending social dissolution, and the profound apathy into which the whole Russian people seem to have fallen. The only beings full of life and activity, amid this lethargy of satiety, seem to be the omnipresent and ever-invisible Nihilists. Clearly there must be a change. From all this social rottenness, the black fungus of Nihilism has sprung. Its hot-bed has been preparing for years, by the gradual sapping of moral tone and self-respect and the debauchery of the higher class, who always give the impulse to those below them for good or evil. All that lacked was the occasion and the man. Under the passport system of Nicholas, the chances for becoming polluted by Paris life were confined to a mere handful of rich nobles, whom the caprice of the Czar allowed to travel. Even they, the privileged of favour and fortune, had to apply for permission six months in advance, and pay a thousand roubles for their passport, with a heavy fine for each day in excess of the time granted, and the prospect of confiscation of their entire property should the foreign stay exceed three years. But with Alexander everything was changed; the emancipation of the Serfs was followed by numberless reforms—the unmuzzling of the press, trial by jury, equalizing the rights of citizenship, free passports, etc. Though good in themselves, these reforms came with such a rush upon a people unaccustomed to the least of these privileges, as to throw them into a high fever. The patient, escaping from his strait jacket, ran wildly about the streets. Then came the Polish Revolution of 1863, in which a number of Russian students participated. Reaction followed and repressive measures were readopted one by one; but it was too late. The caged animal had tasted liberty, though ever so brief, and thenceforward could not be docile as before. Where there had been but one Russian traveller to Paris, Vienna and Berlin under the old reign, now there were thousands and tens of thousands; just so many more agencies were at work to import 360  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS fashionable vice and scientific scepticism.

Trade unions, infected with the notions of the International, sprang up like mushrooms; and demagogues ranted to social clubs upon the conflict between labour and capital. The cauldron began to seethe. At last the man came. The history of Nihilism can be summed up in two words. For their name they are indebted to the great novelist Turgenyev, who created Bazaroff, and stamped the type with the name of Nihilist . Little did the famous author of Fathers and Sons imagine at that time into what national degradation his hero would lead the Russian people"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"twenty-five years later. Only “Bazaroff”—in whom the novelist painted with satirical fidelity the characteristics of certain “Bohemian” negationists, then just glimmering on the horizon of student life—had little in common, except the name and materialistic tendency, with the masked revolutionists and terrorists of today. Shallow, bilious, and nervous, this studiosus medicinae is simply an unquiet spirit of sweeping negation; of that sad, yet scientific scepticism reigning now supreme in the ranks of the highest intellect; a spirit of materialism, sincerely believed in, and as honestly preached; the outcome of long reflections over the rotten remnants of man and frog in the dissecting-room, where the dead man suggested to his mind no more than the dead frog. Outside of animal life everything to him is nihil; “a thistle,” growing out of a lump of mud, is all that man can look forward to after death. And thus this type—Bazaroff—was caught up as their highest ideal by the university students. The “Sons” began destroying what the “Fathers” had built . . . And now Turgenyev is forced to taste of the bitter fruits of the tree of his planting. Like Frankenstein, who could not control the mechanical monster that his ingenuity had T HE H ISTORY OF A “B OOK ”  361 c o n s t r u c ted out of the putrefactions of the churchyard, he now finds his “type”—which was from the first hateful and terrible to him—grown into the ranting spectre of the Nihilist delirium, the red-handed socialist. The press, at the initiative of the Moskovskiya Vedomosty— a centenarian paper—takes up the question and openly accuses the most brilliant literary talent of Russia—one whose sympathies are, and always have been, on the side of the “Fathers,” with having been the first to plant the poisonous weed. Owing to the peculiar transitional state of Russian society between 1850 and 1860, the name was hailed and adopted and the Nihilists began springing up on every side. They captured the national literature, and their new doctrines were fast disseminated throughout the whole empire. And now Nihilism has grown into a power—an imperium in imperio . It is no more with Nihilism with which Russia struggles, but with the terrible consequences of the ideas of 1850. Fathers and Sons must henceforth occupy a prominent place, not only in literature, as quite above the ordinary level of authorship, but also as the creator of a new page in Russian political history, the end of which no man can foretell.

The Council of the Society having nothing more to say to the reverend polemic, who, in rejoinder to a brief card, treats the world to two columns of what Coleridge would call “a juggle of sophistry,” I, myself, would ask you to favour me with a brief space. A few points of Mr. Scott’s most glaring misconceptions (?) about our Society may be noticed. We are said to have declared, at New York, that the Theosophical Society was hostile to the “Christian Church”; while at Mayo Hall, Allahabad, our President affirmed that his Society was not organized to fight “Christianity.” This is assumed to be a contradiction and a “change of base.” Now if there were enough “Christianity” in the “Christian Church” to be spoken of, the gentleman’s point of view might be deemed well taken. But, in my humble opinion, this is not at all the case. Hence—though not at all hostile to “Christianity,” i . e ., the ethics alleged to have been preached by Jesus of Nazareth, I, in common with many Theosophists, am very much so to the so-called “Church of Christ.” Collectively, this Church includes three great rival religions and some hundreds of minor sects, for the most part bitterly recriminative, and, mutually, far more hostile to each other than we are to all. To accuse, therefore, the Theosophist—who may dislike the Methodist, Presbyterian, Jesuit, Baptist, or any other alleged “Christian” sect, of bitter hatred of “Christianity” in the abstract—is like accusing one of hating M ISSIONARIES M ILITANT  363 light be c ause he opposes the use of either or all of the many new-fangled inventions of kerosene lamps, which, under the pretext of preserving the sight, injure it! The Christianity of Jesus, dragged by its numberless sects around the arena of our century, appears like that car in the Slavonian fable (a version of one by Aesop) to which were harnessed all manner of creeping, swimming, and flying things. Each of these, following its own instinct, attempted to draw the car after its own fashion. Result—between the birds, animals, reptiles, and fishes, the unfortunate vehicle was torn into fragments. The reverend missionaries are hard to please in this country.

Thus, for instance, we had to call the strong hand of the law to our help in the case of The Dnyanodaya— a diminutive and sorry, but quite a fighting, little missionary weekly of Bombay, which called our Society names, and had to apologize in print for it. Now comes The Bengal Magazine of January. Its Editor—by-the-by, a Christian reverend, but, nevertheless, very rude Babu—is advised to look out, and consult law, before he charges Colonel Olcott or anyone else with “hocus-pocus tricks” again; as the “gushing Colonel” may prove as little gushing and as active in his case as he was in that of the abusive little Dnyanodaya . And now Mr. T. G.

Most military or civil employés of experience in India whom I have met take the same view of the matter that she does. I cannot imagine why Darwin 364  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS and Tyndall should have been selected by Mr. Scott, out of thousands of scientific and educate d men now pulling Christianity to pieces, as “noisy characters”; nor why he should cite, in an issue created by modern biblical research, Newton, Kepler, Herschel, or any one else who lived before the recent advances of science in this direction, and in days when, to deny not merely Christianity, but some minor dogma of the state religion was equal to a self-condemnation to an auto-da-fé . As for the Christianity of Max Müller, Dr. Carpenter (a prince among materialists), and the late Louis Agassiz, the less said, the better. Might not his long string of high-sounding names have been profitably enlarged by the addition of those of the late Viscount Amberley and Lord Queensborough, of the “church” of Moncure Conway, in which is preached the great Religion of Humanity free from every “religion” and church? “Science is our guide, and truth is the spirit that we worship,” says the noble Lord Queensborough in his letter recently published in The Statesman ! Mr. Scott assures his readers that “never since the Apostles has it (Christianity) been so vigorous as now,” “the tendency is anything else than to ‘infidelity’ and ‘atheism’.” And Lord Queensborough, in his letter to “E. C. H.,” challenges the latter, and with him the whole world of Christians in these remarkable words: Call us atheists and infidels if you will; . . . and I maintain, and will maintain, that the time has arrived for us to proclaim ourselves and to claim to be respected, as other religious bodies are; but as we never shall be, unless we stand forward and openly declare what our religion is . . .

Equally ill-timed was Mr. Scott’s M ISSIONARIES M ILITANT  365 quotati o n from the New Testament of the passage: “Jesus said, Other sheep I have, not of this fold.” For in the very mouth of Jesus are also put the words: “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned ” ( Mark , xvi, 16). To this Mr. Scott may, perhaps, repeat what he says in his two-column letter: The whole question of the nature and extent of future punishment is a matter of interpretation . Exactly. So we, Theosophists and other heathen and “infidels,” who live in a century of free th ought and in a country of religious freedom, avail ourselves of it. And now all his points being answered, the reverend gentleman is at liberty to ventilate his ideas and pour his wrath upon the Theosophists wherever he likes. Yet, unless he can get his satisfaction from following the good example of other missionaries, and indulge in monologues of abuse, he can reckon but little upon us to answer him. It takes two for a dialogue; and whether as a Society or as individuals, we decline any further controversy on the subject with one who gives so few facts and so many words. H. P.

Why he T HE S ILENT B ROTHER  367 d e c l i n e d to accept as pupil a young man of a good family and very intelligent, was a secret which Glaüerbach—the ,narrator of the tale—could never penetrate.

The most extraordinary stories were told of him, and the more they were extraordinary the more willingly people believed them. They said that Cagliostro had shown pictures of future events in his magic mirrors to some of the most illustrious statesmen of France, and that these events had all come to pass. The king and the royal family had been of the number of those who were allowed to peer into the unknown. The “magician\" had evoked the shades of Cleopatra and Julius Caesar, of Mohammed and Nero. Ghengis Khan and Charles the Fifth had held a conversazione with the minister of the police; and an outwardly pious, but secretly sceptical Christian Archbishop having shown a desire to have his doubts cleared, one of the gods was summoned—but did not come, for he had never existed in flesh. Marmontel having expressed the desire to meet Belisarius, he, upon seeing the great warrior emerging from the ground, fell senseless.* Young, daring and passionate Glaüerbach, feeling that Cagliostro would never share with him more than a few crumbs of his great learning, turned in another direction, and at last found an unfrocked abbot, who for a consideration took upon himself –––––––––– * [Reference is here to Jean Franvois Mannontel (1723.99), French writer, historiographer of France a n d s e c r etary to the Academy.

In a few months (?) he had learned the weird secrets of black and whit e magic, i.e., the art of cleverly bamboozling fools. He also visited Mesmer and his clairvoyants, whose number had become very large at that period. The ill-fated French society of 1785 felt its doom approaching; it suffered from spleen and greedily seized upon anything that brought it a change in its killing satiety and lethargic monotony. It had become so sceptical that, at last, from believing in nothing, it ended by believing anything. Glaüerbach, under the experienced direction of his abbot, began practicing upon human credulity. But he had not been more than eight months at Paris, when the police paternally advised him to go abroad—for his health. There was no appeal from such advice. However convenient the capital of France for old hands at charlatanry, it is less so for beginners. He left Paris and went, via Marseilles, to Palermo. In that city the intelligent pupil of the abbot got acquainted with, and contracted a friendship with Marquis Hector, youngest son of the Prince R...............V..............., one of the most wealthy and noble families of Sicily. Three years earlier, a great calamity had befallen that house. Hector’s eldest brother, Duke Alfonso, had disappeared without leaving any clue; and the old prince, half-killed with despair, had left the world for the retirement of his magnificent villa in the suburbs of Palermo, where he led the life of a recluse.

Fate, however, decided it should be so, and the young people formed a mutual and passionate attachment. As Alfonso was too young to be married, he was sent travelling, and remained absent for over four years. Upon his return, preparations were being made for the celebration of the nuptials, which the old Prince had decided should form one of the future epopees of Sicily. They were planned upon the most magnificent scale. The wealthiest and noblest of the land had assembled two months beforehand and were being royally entertained in the family mansion, which occupied a whole square of the old city, as all were more or less related to either the R...............V...............or the Alfieri families in the second, fourth, twentieth or sixtieth degree. A host of hungry poets and improvisatori had arrived, uninvited, to sing, according to the local custom of those days, the beauty and virtues of the newly-married couple. Livorno sent a ship-load of sonnets, and Rome the Pope’s blessing. Crowds of people curious to witness the procession had come to Palermo from afar; and whole regiments of the light-fingered gentry prepared to practice their profession at the first opportunity. The marriage ceremony had been fixed for a Wednesday. On Tuesday the bridegroom disappeared without leaving the slightest trace. The police of the whole land was set afoot. Uselessly, alas! Alfonso had for several days been going from town to Monte Cavalli—a lovely villa of his––to superintend in person the preparations for the reception of his lovely bride, with whom he was to pass his honey-moon in that charming village. On Tuesday evening he had repaired there alone and on horseback as usual, to return home early on the following morning. About ten in the evening two contadini had met and saluted him. That was the last any one saw of the young Duke. Later, it was ascertained that on that night a pirate vessel had been cruising in the waters of Palermo; that the 370  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS corsairs had been ashore, and carried away several Sicilian women. In the latter part of the last c entury, Sicilian ladies were considered as very valuable goods : there was a large demand for the commodity in the markets of Smyrna, Constantinople, and the Barbary Coast; the rich pashas paying for them enormous sums. Besides pretty Sicilian women, the pirates used to smuggle away rich people for the sake of the ransom. The poor men, when caught, shared the fate of the working-cattle, and fed on flogging. Everyone at Palermo firmly believed that young Alfonso had been carried away by the pirates; and it was far from being improbable. The High Admiral of the Sicilian navy immediately"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"dispatched after the pirates four swift vessels, renowned above all others for their speed. The old Prince promised mountains of gold to him who would give him back his son and heir. The little squadron being ready, it spread its sails and disappeared on the horizon. On one of the vessels was Hector R........... V.......... At nightfall, the watchers on the deck had as yet seen nothing. Then the breeze freshened, and about midnight it was blowing a hurricane. One of the vessels returned to port immediately, the two others were driven away before the gale and were never heard of more, and the one, on which was young Hector, returned two days after, dismantled and a wreck, to Trapani. The night before, the watchers, in one of the beacon towers along the shore, saw a brig far off, which, without mast, sails or flag, was being furiously carried along on the crest of the angry sea. They concluded it must be the pirates’ brig. It went down in full sight, and the report spread that every soul on board, to the very last man, had perished. Notwithstanding all this, emissaries were sent by the old Prince in every direction—to Algiers, Tunis, Morocco, Tripoli, and Constantinople. But they found nothing; and when Glaüerbach arrived at Palermo, three years had passed since the event. The Prince, though having lost a son, did not relish the idea of losing the wealth of the Alfieris in the bargain. He concluded to marry Bianca to his second son, Hector. But 371  T HE S ILENT B ROTHER the fair Bianca wept, and would not be consoled. She refused point-blank, and declared she woul d remain faithful to her Alfonso. Hector behaved like a true knight. “Why make poor Bianca still more miserable, by worrying her with prayers? Perhaps my brother is yet alive”—he said. “How could I, then, in view of such an uncertainty, deprive Alfonso, in case he should return, of his best treasure, and the one dearer to him than life itself!” Touched with the exhibition of such noble feelings, Bianca began to relax her indifference for her Alfonso’s brother. The old man did not lose all hopes. Besides, Bianca was a woman; and with women in Sicily, as elsewhere, the absent are always in the wrong. She finally promised, if she should ever have a positive assurance of Alfonso’s death, to marry his brother, or—no one. Such was the state of affairs when Glaüerbach—he who boasted of the power of raising the shadows of the dead— appeared at the princely and now mournful and deserted country villa of the R........... V.......... He had not been there a fortnight before he captivated the affections and admirations of everyone. The mysterious and the occult, and especially dealings with a world unknown, the “silent land,” have a charm for everyone in general and for the afflicted especially. The old Prince took courage one day and asked the crafty German to solve their cruel doubts. Was Alfonso dead or alive? That was the question. Taking a few minutes to reflect, Glaüerbach answered in this wise : —“Prince, what you ask me to do for you is very important . . . Yes, it is quite true. If your unfortunate son is no more, I may be enabled to call forth his shadow; but will not the shock be too violent for you?"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Will your son and your pupil—the charming Countess Bianca—consent to it?” “Anything rather than cruel uncertainty,” the old Prince answered. And so the evocation was decided upon, to take place a week from that day. When Bianca heard of it, she fainted. Recalled to her senses by an abundance of restoratives, curiosity got the better of her scruples. She was a daughter of Eve, as women all are. Hector began by setting 372  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS himself with all his might against what he regarded as a sacrilege. He did not wish to trouble t he rest of the dear departed; he at first said, if his beloved brother was really dead, he preferred not to know it. But at last his growing love for Bianca and the desire to satisfy his father prevailed, and he too consented. The week demanded by Glaüerbach for preparation and purification, seemed a century to the impatience of all three. Had it been a day longer, they must have all gone mad. Meanwhile, the necromancer had not been losing his time. Suspecting that the demand in this direction would come one day, he had from the first quietly gathered the minutest particulars about the deceased Alfonso, and most carefully studied his life-size portrait which hung in the old Prince’s bedroom. This was enough for his purpose. To add to the solemnity, he had enjoined upon the family a strict fast and prayers, day and night, during the whole week. At last the longed-for hour arrived, and the Prince, accompanied by his son and Bianca, entered the necromancer’s apartment. Glaüerbach was pale and solemn, but composed. Bianca trembled from head to foot and kept her bottle of aromatic salts in constant use. The Prince and Hector looked like two criminals led to execution. The large room was lighted by only a single lamp, and even this dim light was suddenly extinguished. Amid the thick darkness, the lugubrious voice of the conjuror was heard to pronounce a short cabalistic formula in Latin, and finally, to command the shadow of Alfonso to appear—if it was, indeed, in the land of the shadows. Suddenly the darkness of the furthest recess in the room became illuminated with a feeble bluish light, which, by slow degrees, brought before the sight of the audience a large magic mirror, which seemed to be covered with a thick mist. In its turn, this mist was gradually dissipated, and finally, the prostrate form of a man appeared to the eyes of those present. It was Alfonso! His body had on the identical dress he wore on the evening of his disappearance; heavy chains clasped his hands, and he lay dead on the sea-shore. Water dripped from his long hair and blood- T HE S ILENT B ROTHER  373 stained a nd torn clothes; then a huge wave crept on and, engulfing him, all suddenly"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"disappeared. A dead silence had reigned during the whole progress of this fearful vision. The persons present trembling violently tried to keep their breath; then all relapsed into darkness, and Bianca, uttering a feeble moan, fell senseless into the arms of her guardian. The shock had proved too much. The young girl had a brain fever which held her between life and death for weeks. The Prince felt little better; and Hector never left his room for a fortnight. No more doubts—Alfonso was dead, he was drowned. The walls of the palace were hung with black cloth, strewn all over with silver tears. For three days, the bells of many churches at Palermo tolled for the unfortunate victim of the pirates and the sea. The inside of the great cathedral was also draped from floor to dome in black velvet. Two thousand and five-hundred gigantic tapers flickered around the catafalque; and Cardinal Ottoboni, assisted by five bishops, daily performed the service for the dead for six long weeks. Four thousand ducats were distributed in charity to the poor at the portal of the cathedral, and Glaüerbach, clad in a sable mantle like one of the family, represented its absent members, during the funeral obsequies. His eyes were red, and when he covered them with his scented pocket-handkerchief, those near him heard his convulsive sobs. Never had a secrilegious comedy been better performed. Soon after, a magnificent monument of pure Carrara marble, sculptured with two allegorical figures, was raised in Alfonso’s memory in St. Rosalia’s church. On the sarcophagus grandiloquent inscriptions in Greek and Latin were cut by order of the old Prince. Three months later, the news spread that Bianca was wedded to Hector. Glaüerbach, who had meanwhile gone to travel all over Italy, returned to Monte Cavalli on the eve of the marriage. He exhibited his wonderful necromantic powers elsewhere, and had the “holy” Inquisition upon his heels. He felt full security only in the bosom of the family which adored and looked upon him as a demi-god 374  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS On the following morn, the numerous guests proceeded to the chapel, which was resplen d ent with gold and silver and decorated as for a royal wedding. How happy looked the bridegroom! How lovely the bride! The old Prince wept for joy, and Glaüerbach had the honor of being Hector’s best man. In the garden were spread enormous banquet tables at which were entertained the vassals of both the families. The feasts of Gargantua were less rich than such a festival. Fifty fountains spouted wine instead of water; but towards sunset, no one could drink any more, for unfortunately—for some people—human thirst is not infinite. Roasted pheasants and partridges were thrown by the dozens to the neighboring dogs, which they too left untouched, for even they were gorged to the throat. Suddenly, among the gay and showy crowd, there appeared a new guest, who attracted general attention. It was a man, thin as a skeleton, very tall, and clad in the dress of the penitent monks or “Silent Brothers,” as they are popularly called. This dress"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"consists of a long, flowing, gray, woollen garment, girded with a rope at the two ends of which hang human bones, and a pointed hood which entirely covers the face, except two holes for the eyes. Among many orders of penitent monks in Italy—the black, gray, red, and white penitents—none inspire such an instinctive terror as these. Besides, no one has the right to address a penitent brother, while his hood is pulled down over his face; the penitent has not only the full right but the obligation to remain unknown to all. Thus, this mysterious brother, who so unexpectedly appeared at the wedding feast, was addressed by none, though he seemed to follow the newly-married couple, as if he were their shadow. Both Hector and Bianca shuddered every time they turned to look at him. The sun was setting, and the old Prince, accompanied by his children, was for the last time going the round of the banquet tables in the gardens. Stopping at one of these, he took a goblet of wine and exclaimed : “My friends, let us drink to the health of Hector and his wife Bianca!” T HE S ILENT B ROTHER  375 B u t , a t t h i s very moment, someone seized his arm and stopped it. It was the gray-frocked “Silent Brother.” Quietly emerging from the crowd, he had approached the table and also taken up a goblet. “And is there no one, old man, besides Hector and Bianca whose health thou couldst propose?”—he asked in deep, guttural tones—“Where is thy son Alfonso?” “Knowest thou not he is dead?”—sadly answered the Prince. “Yes! . . . dead—dead!” echoed the penitent. “But were he only to hear again the voice he heard at the moment of his cruel death, methinks he might respond . . . aye . . . from his very grave . . . Old man, summon here thy son Hector! . . . “Good God! What do you . . . what can you mean!” be more easily imagined than described. In one moment—exclaimed the Prince, pallid with unnameable terror. Bianca was ready to faint. Hector, more livid than his father, was hardly standing on his legs, and would have fallen, had not Glaüerbach supported him. “To the memory of Alfonso!” slowly pronounced the same lugubrious voice.—“Let everyone repeat the words after me! Hector, Duke of R........... V.......... . . . I invite you to pronounce them! . . .” Hector made a violent effort and, wiping his trembling lips, tried to open them. But his tongue cleaved to the roof of his mouth and he failed to utter a sound. Every eye was riveted upon the young man. He was pallid as death and his mouth foamed. At last, after a superhuman struggle with his weakness, he stammered out, “To the memory of Alfonso! . . .” “ The voice of my mur-de-rer! . . ,” ejaculated the penitent in a deep but distinct tone. With these words, throwing back his hood, he tore open his robe, and before the sight of the horrified guests there appeared the dead form of Alfonso, with four deep gaping wounds on his breast, from which trickled four streams of blood!"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"The cries of terror and the fright of the spectators can 376  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS the garden became empty; the whole crowd upsetting the tables and flying as if for life . . . But, more s trange than all, was the fact that it was Glaüerbach who, notwithstanding his intimate acquaintance with the dead, was the most panic-stricken. Upon seeing a real ghost, the necromancer, who had raised the dead at will, hearing him talk as would a living being, fell senseless upon a bed of flowers, and was picked up, late that night, a stark lunatic, which he remained for months. It was only half a year later that he learned what had taken place after the terrific arraignment. After uttering it, the penitent disappeared from the eyes of all, and Hector was carried into his room in violent convulsions, where, an hour later, after summoning his confessor to his bedside, he made him write down his deposition, and after signing it, drank, before he could be stopped, the poisonous contents of a hollow seal-ring, and expired almost immediately. The old Prince followed him to the grave a fortnight later, leaving all his fortune to Bianca. But the unfortunate girl, whose early life had been doomed to two such tragedies, sought refuge in a convent, and her immense wealth passed into the hands of the Jesuits. Guided by a dream, she had selected a distant and unfrequented corner in the large garden of Monte Cavalli, as the site for a magnificent chapel, which she had erected as an expiatory monument of the fearful crime which put an end to the ancient family of the Princes of R...........

While digging the foundations, the workmen discovered an old dry well, and in it, the skeleton of Alfonso, with four stabs in his half-decayed breast, and the wedding ring of Bianca upon his finger. Such a scene as the one on the wedding-day, is sufficient to shake the most hardened scepticist. Upon recovering, Glaüerbach left Italy forever, and returned to Vienna, where none of his friends was at first able to recognize the young man of hardly twenty-six in his old decrepit form with his hair as white as snow. He renounced the evocation of spirits and charlatanry forever, but became from that time a firm believer in the survival of the human soul N OTE TO “R ADIANT M ATTER ”  377 and in it s occult powers. He died in 1841, an honest and reformed man, scarcely opening his mouth upon this weird history.

It is not a pleasant picture for the conscientious Christian who believes in going to church regularly and listening to the word of God as expounded by the clerical gentlemen who may happen to have the floor of the pulpit. 380  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS We scar c ely know where to begin—the list of these eccentric pastors is such an appalling one. The special weaknesses of the Rev. H. W. B. are pretty well under stood; he has, however, found humble imitators in the Rev. Mr. Hafermann, of the Hoboken Lutheran Evangelical Church who kisses his cook for “pure” Christian motives, and for her spiritual welfare, and the Rev. Mr. Trumbrower, pastor of the Porter Methodist Episcopal Church, also in Hoboken, who is getting himself talked about for his osculatory practices with one Mrs. Boh, a member of his flock, and a married woman, by the way. But while Hoboken, with its Hafermann and Trumbrower, may eventually prove a worthy and formidable rival to Brooklyn and its notorious pastors, it is not going to carry off all the honours in clerical misdoings. Connecticut, represented by the Rev. Mr. Hayden, will not permit it. It goes in for something a trifle stronger than mere kissing. It goes for higher game—betrayal and murder; true, not proven according to the opinion of an intelligent jury, but unpleasantly probable. New York has of late been a little behindhand in crooked clergymen, although, as becomes a patriotic citizen, the Reverend Mr. Cowley will not allow it to be left altogether out in the cold. The story of the saintly Mr. Cowley’s executive ability in his management of the Shepherd’s Fold, and dieting its little inmates, is already familiar to everybody, and we fondly hope that Mr. Cowley will soon become familiar with the interior of a cell in some respectable jail. There are many more of these saintly sinners, who have distinguished themselves in a greater or lesser degree, but we forebear mentioning their names. The subject is not an inviting one, but yet it must not be shirked; on the contrary, it must be vigorously handled, for the protection of our wives, our daughters, our children, and for everything that is dear to us in our domestic life. These men—these pastors—to whom practically the care of our families is confided, are constantly disgracing themselves."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"It is not a question of the misfortune of any one denomination, disgraced by these unworthy guardians. Protestant, Catholic, Atheist, and Jew are alike interested in the exposure and punishment of the public teacher who betrays his trust and misuses his privileges.

T HE S TATE OF C HRISTIANITY  381 Catholi c and Protestant clergymen are depicted in their proven characters of voluptuaries, peculators, and sensationalists; each picture being inscribed with proper names, extracted from the records of the law-courts. No wonder that decent young graduates should prefer any other profession than one which is so rapidly falling into disrepute. Who can be surprised at the growing scepticism throughout Christendom? We are approaching the crisis of the Western religion, and none but a bold and enthusiastic apologist dares deny that its doom is sealed. Without the revival of Aryan philosophy, for which we are labouring, the West will tend towards the grossest materialism; but with the opening of that long-sealed fountain of spiritual refreshment, we may hope that there will arise, upon the ruins of the bad new faith, the superstructure of the good old one, for the salvation of a world given over to vice and folly. A few weeks ago, an audience of nearly 4,000 persons of the better class gathered at Chicago, to listen to a defense of the memory of Thomas Paine by that splendid American orator, Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll. Paine was one of the purest, wisest, and bravest apostles of Free Thought that the Anglo-Saxon race has produced. He wrote The Age of Reason— a book which. if the missionaries were governed by the spirit of fair-play, would be on the shelf of every mission library in India, so that their “Heathen” pupils might read both sides of the Christian question. For this crime, the noble author was persecuted in the most malicious way by Christians. His name was made the synonym of all that is vile and malevolent. His enemies, not satisfied with lying about him while alive, desecrated his grave, and we have ourselves seen his monument at New Rochelle, New York, bespattered with dung and battered with sticks and stones. But time heals all injustice, and now, seventy years after Thomas Paine’s death, his memory is vindicated. He died almost solitary and alone, deserted by friends, and his services to American liberty all forgotten. But now, thousands and hundreds of thousands of the most intelligent and influential ladies and gentlemen of America have cheered to the echo Colonel Ingersoll’s glowing periods. 382  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"In the address above alluded to, for a verbatim report of which we are indebted to the Religio-Philosophical Journal , the Spiritualist organ to which an allusion was made by us last month, occur the following passages:— [Here follows a lengthy extract from Colonel Robert G.

It is an unexpected, and very unusual piece of literature; and the subject is treated in a way to startle the whole of the Protestant Church, call out an inward chuckle of satisfaction from the Jesuits, and provoke extreme dissatisfaction among the Conservative, church-going Anglo-Indian officials. Yet it is an honest and sincere profession of faith. Simple and dignified, without one word of recrimination against those who will be the first to throw stones at him, entirely heedless of possible consequences, the author—a District Judge, we believe—Mr. G. C. Whitworth, comes out bravely and without ostentation, to tell the truth to the world about himself. He has “come to the conclusion that it is better that every man’s opinions, whether right or wrong, should be known”; and feeling that he “will never reach that state of straightforwardness and simplicity of conversation and conduct” after which he is striving, he does not wish to remain any longer “in a false position,” and hence renounces Christianity publicly and in print. All honour to the man who is brave and honest in this century of sham beliefs and shameful hypocrisy!—who, regardless of all dangers—and such an act entails more than one—throws off the mask of false pretence that stifles him, with the sole motive of doing what he deems his duty to himself and those who know him. 384  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Mr. Whitworth not only tells us what he believes no more in, but also makes a stateme n t of the personal belief that has superseded the Christianity he now repudiates. Before he was as certain as he is now of what his duty in this question was, he used to wonder what orthodox churchmen would advise him to do. I have heard [he says] of such a thing as, stamping out, or trying to stamp out, unbelief from the mind. I suppo s e the process is to set before yourself the idea that it would be a good thing if you could believe, and then to determine to act on all occasions as though you did, until at length it comes to seem to be a matter of course that you do believe. Now such a course of conduct seems to me to be wrong. I cannot see how a man is justified in trying to settle by resolution what he will believe, and in stifling instead of fairly examining doubts which may arise as to his past belief. Nor does anyone recommend this course to persons of a different creed to his own . . . And though [he says further on] I would not willingly suggest doubt to the mind of any person happily free from it, and worthily occupied in this world, I can in no degree concur in the opinion that it is necessary to keep up artificial religions for the sake of the unenlightened masses."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"“Government by illusion” is an expression I have lately heard. I cannot but think that the bare truth is better. More particularly if you think that a God of infinite power created and governs the world, does it seem unreasonable to suppose that He means those of His creatures that are comparatively wise to invent erroneous notions about Him for their ignorant fellows to believe. We have been so long accustomed to associate such things as worship, prayer, sacraments, and holy offices with religion, that some men seem to fear that, if all these were got rid of, nothing would remain. That is not my experience. It should be remembered that all immoral and dangerous persons are either already without religion—in which case they could lose none if the doctrine of government by illusion were given up—or else that the religion they have has been useless to them [pp. 4-5.] After that Mr. Whitworth states his present religious belief and says:— I believe that it is every man’s duty to do what he can to make the world better and happier. That is the whole of my creed. I aim at no precision of language. Many other formulas would do as well. So to live that the world may be better for my having lived in it is the one most familiar to my thoughts. The meaning is plain, and there is nothing new in it . . . To me it seems absurd to attempt to devise a creed, or even to take, with any fixed resolution of keeping it, a ready-made one. What A P ERSONAL S TATEMENT  385 a man finds in the actual experience of his life to be good, that is what he must believe . . . [p. 7.] Now, be f ore I attempt to explain how I find the simple creed I have enunciated better than all the dogmas I once believed, I will refer to certain points on which (though they do not belong to my religion) I shall no doubt be expected, in such a publication as this, to express distinct opinions. Such a question is, Do you believe in God? Now I wish to be perfectly frank, but it is beyond my power to answer this question clearly. I certainly did until within a few years believe in God, but then I had a particular conception of him—namely, the being known as God the Father in the Church of England. Now, I am sure we are not warranted in holding that conception and I have formed no other distinct conception of God. I cannot say I believe in God when the word conveys no distinct meaning to me; I cannot say I do not believe in Him when my thoughts seem sometimes to require the use of the name. Perhaps that impression is due only to old habit. We hear it said that the existence of God is proved by the manifest design of the universe. But what sort of God? Surely one of finite, not of infinite power. The world is very wonderful; but how can we call it a perfect work? There are some terrible things in it. Perhaps it will be perfect, but time cannot be necessary to infinite power. I heard a preacher once expatiate on God’s power and love as shown in the structure of an animal. He took the mole as an example, and explained how its every part was perfectly adapted to the peculiar manner of its life. But what if a ploughman kills the mole? Carefully provided as all its properties were, they have all failed. Then the preacher spoke of the wonderful providence by which some plants are made to purify pestilential air. But we in India know that other plants by their natural decay poison instead of purifying the air. So, what do such examples prove? I am not dismayed or distressed at such puzzles, or because I cannot say whether or not I believe in God . . . The world teaches us plainly that there are countless things which I cannot know . . . My attempt to answer the above question is sufficient to show that I do not believe in the divinity of Christ, or of any other supposed incarnation of God. I add that it is between twelve and fifteen years since I had any such belief [pp. 8-10.] As to a future life, the author neither affirms belief nor disbelief. He hopes we may live aft e r death but he personally feels no conviction of it."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"My religion then [he goes on to say] it may perhaps be said by those who find comfort in any of the recognized religions of the day, leaves we without any God, without prayer or worship of any kind, leaves me a weak mortal struggling alone with the difficulties of this 386  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS life . . . Well, if I hear such things said of my religion, I shall bear it patiently . . . While I am writing this in the saloon of the Venetia , this 23rd of November, I can hear the passengers at service, overhead, singing— “Leave, ah leave me not alone, Still support and strengthen me.” If some of them are less alone than I, it should not make me discontented, for I know that I am better with my religion than I, the same person, was with theirs. But, notwithstanding . . . those objections which many persons will make, I do deliberately put forward this religion of mine as something better for humanity than any other . . . I believe that most, or at least very many, men of business, working men, are as I am . . . If, as a fact, men do not already hold the creed that I do, I do not expect that by anything I can say they will come to do so. But there are two things which I can still hope I hope that those of my readers who really believe no more than l do, but who in a half-hearted way cling to dogmas, which indeed to them are dead and ineffective, will examine and see what they really do believe and what they do not, distinguishing between those articles of belief which they give effect to in their lives and those they hold merely for want of energy to throw away. And I hope that those who find their actual belief to be less than or different from what their neighbours have been led to suppose it to be, will ask themselves the question whether they ought not in some way or other to remove the misapprehension and make their lives speak truly to all who behold them. [pp. 11-12.] But there are two classes of persons to whom I can hardly hope to make intelligible the step I am taking in publishing this statement. The first class is the clergy and all persons engaged in teaching or propagating any religion; the second, all idle persons. These two very different classes seem to me to be less likely than other persons to discover that the religions they observe are false, if they are false. Rather are they likely, as I conceive, to find them, whatever they are, to be sufficient and satisfactory. In the case of the first, because religion is the business of their lives; and in the case of idle persons, because what they have of religion is better than the rest of their lives . . . A man’s life and his religion should be one and the same thing. That which is not a part of what his life ought to be, ought not to be a part of his religion. And it seems to me quite intelligible that a man whose business is religious teaching should make his life and religion one and the same, though much of the religion be false, without ever finding that test of true and untrue. If a man’s duty is to explain or teach a certain doctrine, he may find it very difficult to make people believe or understand it; but he will not be in a position to say, well, this doctrine may be true or false, but it has nothing to do with my life. It has to do with his life. [pp. 12-13.] A P ERSONAL S TATEMENT  387 The author , explaining how his creed is a better religion for the world at large than any other, says:—"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"In the first place, this religion seems to me to have the property of being constantly present in a way which other religions are usually not. I do not think it is sufficient to devote an hour, or two hours, or twelve hours a day to religion. I think the whole day should be so devoted. But, in order for that to be, religion must consist of daily life, and there must be no distinction of spiritual and temporal, of religious and secular, of Sunday and week-day, or of priest and people. The fact that one day is to be kept holy, means that others are distinctly recognized as being something less than holy; and the fact that a holier and purer manner of life and conversation is expected in one particular class of men, means that such high attainment, though practicable, is not expected of the bulk of mankind. Of course all men require time, apart from their proper business, for patient meditation and reflection on the tendency of their lives; all men require the advice of others of different experience to themselves; all men should have time for the fun and the pleasure that life affords. But why should some of these things be called religious, and others non-religious or secular? Is the thing good or bad? is the question that my religion asks; and it asks it equally whether the thing be an act of charity or a game of tennis. If religion and daily life are not one and the same, it will happen that the first is sometimes made to give place to the second. If a church catches fire at the time of public worship, the priest and the people must run out. Their religious service is interrupted but they obey the dictate of a truer religion which bids them save their lives. That which need never be interrupted is the true religion—namely, always to do what is best to be done. [pp. 14-15.] I next claim for my religion that as a fact it has created in me a greater love of the human race than I had when a Christian. When I thought there was virtue in prayer and religious services, and that my first duty was to save my own soul, my sense of the duty of rendering service to men, and my sense of pleasure at the thought of particular services done to particular persons, whether friends or strangers, were certainly less than they are now. If it be said that the difference in me is due not to the change of religion but only to the improved perception and knowledge that years bring, I can only reply that the two causes seem to me to be identical. My religion I have neither invented nor selected: it is what my life has taught me. This religion has again this advantage, that it allows you no rest or permanent happiness except with a sense of duty done. It knows nothing of idle “drawing near to God.” [p. 15.] You must not speak of “leaving with meekness your sins to your Saviour.” Your sins are your own, and you cannot leave them to anyone. The best you can do is to outweigh them with good, but get 388  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS rid of th e m you cannot. There is no absolution. Think of that when you are disposed to do a bad deed again. If you do it, it will remain forever. The balance of good, if even you get a balance of good, will be finally less by reason of that bad debt. [p. 16.] We verily believe that, though Mr. Whitworth gives no name to his deity, and simplif i es his religion, so as to make it appear to be hardly a religion at all, yet he is a truer religionist than any church-going dogmatist. His religion recognizes and worships but the latent divinity indwelling in himself. Like Elijah, he sought for the Lord in the strong wind—but the Lord was not in the wind ; nor was he in the earthquake , nor yet in the fire . But he found Him in the “still small voice”—the voice of his own C ONSCIENCE , the true t abernacle of man. The author without belonging to our Society is yet a true-born Theosophist—a God-seeker.

We did so, and fell upon Marshal MacMahon’s strange adventure with the devil in Algiers. (See The Theosophist for December, 1879.) C OCK - AND -B ULL  389 We were a s sured by the same friend that Marshal MacMahon being alive, and, moreover, a very pious Catholic, and the paper which printed the Story being itself a highly respected, trustworthy organ of the American Roman Catholic bishops, it was impossible to doubt its veracity. It was “absurdly incongruous” in us to think for one moment, that side by side with the “best authenticated miracles of our Lady of Lourdes,” and other places as noteworthy, the Catholic Mirror (of Baltimore, U.S.A.) would publish, at the risk of its literary and Christian reputation, a flim-flam fabrication, a canard . So we copied the adventure, word for word, as we found it in the Mirror of Sept. 13, 1879, prefacing it with this remark of equivocal confidence in its exactness, as everyone can see: “We admit it the more willingly since, had any such story originated with either the Theosophists or the Spiritualists, it would have been straight way ridiculed and set down as a cock-and-bull fable. But circumstances alter the case—with the Catholics; none, however sceptical at heart, will dare laugh (above his breath) at a story of supernatural ‘miracles’ worked by the Madonna and her Saints, or by Satan and his imps . . . Only Spiritiualists and Theosophists . . . deserve to be called ‘lunatics’ for believing in phenomena produced by natural causes.” The Marshal’s alleged adventure was reprinted in the London Spiritualist . Let the editor of that paper now speak:— We recently asked that the truth of some alleged supernatural experiences of Marshal MacMahon, which ha d been quoted by The Theosophist (Bombay) from a Roman Catholic newspaper, should be inquired into by some of our readers. The following letter from Miss Douglas is the result: “Dear Mr. Harrison,—I sent my sister, Mrs. Douglas Bayley, now in Paris, the No. of The Spiritualist"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"in which appeared the marvellous adventure of Marshal MacMahon, said to have been related by himself, begging her to inquire if there was any degree of truth in it. “She writes that there is none.

The details are in their most painful features not such as I can write to you; but if there be any means known to you whereby the influence can be diverted, and it is thought necessary to be more particular in my description of this case, I will send you all the information I possess. So little is known in India of the latest and most startling phase of Western mediumi s tic phenomena—“materialization”—that a few words of explanation are needed to make this case understood. Briefly, then, for several years, in the presence of certain mediums in America and Europe, there have been seen, often under good test conditions, apparitions of the dead, which in every respect seem like living human 396  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS beings. They walk about, write messages to present and absent friends, speak audibly in the lang u ages familiar to them in life, even though the medium may be unacquainted with them, and are dressed in the garb they wore when alive. Many cases of fraudulent personation of the dead have been detected, pretended mediums have sometimes gone on for years deceiving the credulous, and real ones, whose psychical powers have been apparently proved beyond doubt, have been caught playing tricks in some evil hour when they have yielded to either the love of money or notoriety. Still, making every allowance for all these, there is a residuum of veritable cases of the materialization, or the making visible, tangible, and audible of portrait-figures of dead people. These"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"wonderful phenomena have been variously regarded by investigators. Most Spiritualists have looked upon them as the most precious proofs of the soul-survival; while Theosophists, acquainted with the views of the ancient Theurgists, and the still more ancient Aryan philosophers, have viewed them as at best misleading deceptions of the senses, fraught with danger to the physical and moral natures of both medium and spectator—if the latter chances to be susceptible to certain psychical influences. These students of Occultism have noticed that the mediums for materializations have too often been ruined in health by the drain upon their systems, and wrecked in morals. They have over and again warned the Spiritualistic public that mediumship was a most dangerous gift, one only to be tolerated under great precautions. And for this they have received much abuse and few thanks. Still one’s duty must be done at every cost, and the case now before us affords a valuable text for one more bit of friendly counsel. We need not stop to discuss the question whether the so-called materialized forms above described are or are not those of the deceased they look like. That may be held in reserve until the bottom facts of Oriental psychical science are better understood. Nor need we argue as to whether there has ever been an authentic materialization. The London experiences of Mr. William Crookes, F.R.S., and the American ones of Colonel Olcott, both so widely known A C ASE OF O BSESSION  397 and of so c o nvincing a character, give us a sufficient basis of fact to argue upon. We assume the reality of materializations, and shall take the instance cited by the English physician as a subject for diagnosis. The patient then is described as having been “controlled” since attending “circles” where there were materializations, and as having become the bond-slave of some evil powers which force him to say and do painful and even disgusting things, despite his resistance. Why is this? How can a man be compelled to so act against his will? What is Obsession? Three brief questions these are, but most difficult to explain to an uninitiated public. The laws of Obsession can only be well understood by him who has sounded the depths of Indian philosophy. The only clue to the secret, which the West possesses, is contained in that most beneficent science, Magnetism or Mesmerism. That does teach the existence of a vital fluid within and about the human being; the fact of different human polarities; and the possibility of one person projecting this fluid or force at will, to and upon another person differently polarized. Baron Reichenbach’s theory of Odyle or Odic force shows us the existence of this same fluid in the mineral and vegetable as well as the animal kingdoms. To complete the chain of evidence, Buchanan’s discovery of the psychometrical faculty in man enables us to prove, by the help of this faculty, that a subtle influence is exerted by people upon the houses and even the localities they live in, the paper they write upon, the clothing they wear, the portion of the Universal Ether (the Aryan Akâśa ) t he y exist in—and that this is a permanent influence, perceptible"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"even at the most distant epochs from the time when the individual lived and exerted this influence. In one word, we may say that the discoveries of Western science corroborate most fully the hints thrown out by Greek sages and the more defined theories of certain Indian philosophers. Indians and Buddhists believe alike that thought and deed are both material, that they survive, that the evil desires and the good ones of a man environ him in a world of his own making, that these desires and thoughts take on shapes 398  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS that become real to him after death, and that Moksha , in the o ne case, and Nirvana , in the other, cannot be attained until the disembodied soul has passed quite through this shadow-world of the haunting thoughts, and become divested of the last spot of its earthly taint. The progress of Western discovery in this direction has been and must ever be very gradual. From the phenomena of gross to those of more sublimated matter, and thence on towards the mysteries of spirit is the hard road made necessary by the precepts of Aristotle. Western Science first ascertained that our outcoming breath is charged with carbonic acid and, in excess, becomes fatal to human life; then, that certain dangerous diseases are passed from person to person in the sporules thrown off into the air from the sick body; then, that man projects upon everybody and everything he encounters a magnetic aura , peculiar to himself; and finally, the physical disturbance set up in the Ether in the process of thought-evolution is now postulated. Another step in advance will be to realize the magical creative power of the human mind, and the fact that moral taint is just as transmissible as physical. The “influence” of bad companions will then be understood to imply a degrading personal magnetism, more subtle than the impressions conveyed to the eye or the ear by the sights and sounds of a vicious company. The latter may be repelled by resolutely avoiding to see or hear what is bad; but the former enwraps the sensitive and penetrates his very being if he but stop where the moral poison is floating in the air. Gregory’s Animal Magnetism , Reichenbach’s Researches , and Denton’s The Soul of Things will make much of this plain to the Western inquirer, though neither of those authors traces the connection of his favourite branch of science with the parent-stock—Indian Psychology. Keeping the present case in view, we see a man highly susceptible to magnetic impressions, ignorant of the nature of the “materializations” and, therefore, unable to protect himself against bad influences, brought in contact with promiscuous circles where the impressionable medium has long been the unwitting nucleus of evil magnetisms, his A C ASE OF O BSESSION  399"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"system saturated with the emanations of the surviving thoughts and desires of those who are living and those who are dead. The reader is referred to an interesting paper by Judge Gadgil of Baroda (see our December number) on “Hindu Ideas about Communion with the Dead,” for a plain exposition of this question of earth-tied souls, or Piśachas . “ It is cons ider e d,” says that writer, “that in this state the soul being deprived of the means of enjoyment [of sensual pleasures] through its own physical body, is perpetually tormented by hunger, appetite and other bodily desires, and can have only vicarious enjoyment by entering into the living physical bodies of others, or by absorbing the subtlest essences of libations and oblations offered for their own sake.” What is there to surprise us in the fact that a negatively polarized man, a man of a susceptible temperament, being suddenly brought into a current of foul emanations from some vicious person, perhaps still living or perhaps dead, absorbs the insidious poison as rapidly as quicklime does moisture, until he is saturated with it? Thus, a susceptible body will absorb the virus of smallpox, or cholera, or typhus, and we need only recall this to draw the analogy which Occult Science affirms to be warranted. Near the Earth’s surface there hangs over us—to use a convenient simile—a steamy moral fog, composed of the undispersed exhalations of human vice and passion. This fog penetrates the sensitive to the very soul’s core; his psychic self absorbs it as the sponge does water or as fresh milk effluvia. It benumbs his moral sense, spurs his baser instincts into activity, overpowers his good resolutions. As the fumes of a wine-vault make the brain reel, or as the choke-damp stifles one’s breath in a mine, so this heavy cloud of immoral influences carries away the sensitive beyond the limits of self-control, and he becomes “obsessed.” like our English patient. What remedy is there to suggest? Does not our very diagnosis indicate that? The sensitive must have his sensitiveness destroyed; the negative polarity must be changed to a positive; he must become active instead of passive. He can be helped by a magnetiser who understands the nature 400  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS of obsession, and who is morally pure and physically healthy; it must be a powerful magnetis e r, a man of commanding will-force. But the fight for freedom will, after all, have to be fought by the patient himself. His will-power must be aroused. He must expel the poison from his system. Inch by inch he must win back the lost ground. He must realize that it is a question of life or death, salvation or ruin, and strive for victory, like one who makes a last and heroic effort to save his life. His diet must be of the simplest, he must neither eat animal food, nor touch any stimulant, nor put himself in any company where there is the smallest chance for unclean thoughts to be provoked. He should be alone as little as possible, but his companions should be carefully chosen. He should take exercise and be much in the open air; use wood-fire, instead of coals. Every indication that the bad influence was still working within him should be taken as a challenge to control his thoughts and compel them to dwell upon pure, elevating,"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"spiritual things, at every hazard and with a determination to suffer anything rather than give way. If this man can have such a spirit infused into him, and his physician can secure the benevolent help of a strong, healthy magnetiser, of pure character, he may be saved.

Our contributions have been as varied in literary merit as the writers have differed in race and creed. Some have reflected the hopes and aspirations of undergraduates, while others, by ripe Eastern scholars, have won the admiring praise of the greatest authorities of European science. The subjects have been infinitely various, it having been the aim of the Editors to fulfil the promises of the Prospectus and make a free platform, from which the advocates of all the old religions might bespeak the attention of a patient public. It appears that our plan was a good one. Despite the ominous warnings of timid friends, the failure of many previous literary ventures, the prejudice arrayed against us, the malicious obstructiveness of the enemies of Theosophy, the unprofitably cheap rate of subscription, and every other obstacle, our magazine is a financial success; owing no man a pice and paying its way. The table of subscribers’ post-offices, copied last month from our mailing-registers, shows that it is a regular visitor at some hundreds of towns and cities situated in the four quarters of the globe. This means that our advocacy of the study of ancient lore has a world-wide 405  A P EOPLE’S M ONTHLY evidence, and that in the remotest countries people are being taught to revere the wisdom of India . Th e most gratifying fact in connection with our journalistic enterprise is that our subscribers are of every sect and caste, and not preponderatingly of any particular one. Most of those who write to us say that the magazine has been recommended by friends, and many, of every rank and every degree of education, express their gratification with what has appeared in these pages. What precedes will prepare the reader to understand that if, now and then, place has been given to articles of somewhat inferior calibre, the fact must be attributed to design rather than to accident. Not that it would not have been more agreeable to print none but essays of a higher quality; that goes without saying. But we are publishing our magazine for the general public, not alone for the literary critics or antiquarians, and so we always welcome the representatives of popular thought to say their say in the best way they can.

The hope of the century is in the young, the ardent, the susceptible, the energetic, who are just stepping upon the stage. It is worth more to fire the heart of one such lad than to rekindle among the ashes of their elders’ hopes the flickering semblance of a flame. So let us give the young men a chance to explore old records, question and counsel with their parents and teachers, and then publish the results to the great public. They may not always say very profound things, nor use the most elegant phrases, but at least they are sincere and, if encouraged, will be stimulated to study more, take further counsel, and try to write better next time.

The true teachers for the East are Asiatic men, and one of these fledgling Native undergraduates will have a keener sense of Indian intellectual wants than most of our learned professors. The now-confessed total failure of the Cambridge mission to convert the high-class Natives is an example in point. We have more men of the kind they were fishing after in our Bombay Branch alone than were ever converted to Christianity since missions were first established in India.

Says the Cape Town correspondent of the Daily News : — Sad accounts are being brought to light of the atrocities committed by our allies the Amaswazi in the Secocoe n i expedition. They are reported to have spared neither man, woman, nor child in their course; and the dreadful particulars are enough to freeze one’s blood. These things will possibly never come to light. Had they been done under any other flag, they would have called down a world of just indignation; but the name of civilization is supposed to throw a cloak over such atrocities. It is a deep stain on our national honour that, in order to avenge a doubtful quarrel with a man who at least seemed to be capable of understanding the rudiments of civilization, we let loose upon him 10,000 of the greatest barbarians in South Africa and, according to more than one report, absolutely stamped out his clan. Nothing can justify the employment of the Amaswazi in the Secocoeni campaign—certainly not success or cheapness, which seem to be the great merits of the operation. It is enough to make one despair of Christianity to think that in the nineteenth century its professors are able to justify such deeds, and to take credit for adopting towards the natives of this continent the same measures by which the Spaniards of the sixteenth century converted the Indians of the Spanish Main. Slavery may be a bad thing, but between that and extermination there is mighty little to choose and the employment of such ruffians as the Amaswazi means extermination, or it means nothing.

There was not a people wi th anything like philosophy, but gave great prominence to numbers in their application to religious observances, the establishment of festival days, symbols, dogmas, and even the geographical distribution of empires. The mysterious numerical system of Pythagoras was nothing novel when it appeared far earlier than 600 years B.C . The occul t meaning of figures and their combinations entered into the meditations of the sages of every people; and the day is not far off when, compelled by the eternal cyclic rotation of events, our now sceptical unbelieving West will have to admit that in that regular periodicity of ever-recurring events there is something more than a mere blind chance. Already our Western savants begin to notice it. Of late, they have pricked up their ears and begun speculating upon cycles, numbers and all that which, but a few years ago, they had relegated to oblivion in the old closets of memory, never to be unlocked but for the purpose of grinning at the uncouth and idiotic superstitions of our unscientific forefathers. T HE N UMBER S EVEN  409 As one of s uch novelties, the old, and matter-of-fact German journal Die Gegenwart has a serious and learned article upon “the significance of the number seven” introduced to the readers as a “Culture-historical Essay.” After quoting from it a few extracts, we will have something to add to it perhaps. The author says: The number seven wa s considered sacred not only by all the cultured nations of antiquity and the East, but was held in the greatest reverence even by the later nations of the West. The astronomical origin of this number is established beyond any doubt. Man, feeling himself time out of mind dependent upon the heavenly powers, ever and everywhere made earth subject to heaven. The largest and brightest of the luminaries thus became in his sight the most important and highest of powers; such were the planets which the whole antiquity numbered as seven . In course of time these were transformed into seven deities. The Egyptians had seven original and higher gods; the Phoenicians seven kabiris; the Persians, seven sacred horses of Mithra; the Parsees, seven angels opposed by seven demons, and seven celestial abodes paralleled by seven lower regions. To represent the more clearly this idea in its concrete form, the seven gods were often represented as one seven-headed deity. The whole heaven was subjected to the seven planets; hence, in nearly all the religious systems we find seven heavens . The belie f in the sapta lokas of the Brahmanical religion has remained faithful to the archaic philosophy; and — who knows? — but the idea itself was originated in"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Aryavarta, this cradle of all philosophies and mother of all subsequent religions! If the Egyptian dogma of the metempsychosis or the transmigration of soul taught that there were seven states of purification and progressive perfection, it is also true that the Buddhists took from the Aryans of India, not from Egypt, their idea of seven stages of progressive development of the disembodied soul, allegorized by the seven stories and umbrellas, gradually diminishing towards the top on their pagodas. In the mysterious worship of Mithra there were “ seven gates,” seven altars, seven mysteries. The priests of many Oriental nations were subdivided into seven degrees; seven steps led to the altars and in the temples burnt candles in seven -branched candlesticks. Several of the Masonic Lodges have to this day seven and fourteen steps. 410  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS The seven planetary spheres served as a model for state divisions and organizations. China wa s divided into seven provinces; ancient Persia into seven satrapies. According to the Arabian legend seven angels cool the sun with ice and snow, lest it should burn the earth to cinders; and seven thousand angels wind up and set the sun in motion every morning. The two oldest rivers of the East—the Ganges and the Nile—had each seven mouths. The East had in antiquity seven principal rivers (the Nile, the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Oxus, the Jaxartes, the Arax, and the Indus); seven famous treasures; seven cities full of gold; seven marvels of the world, etc. Equally did the number seven play a prominent part in the architecture of temples and palaces. The famous pagoda of Churingham is surrounded by seven square walls, painted in seven different colours, and in the middle of each wall is a seven -storied pyramid; just as in the antediluvian days the temple of Borsippa, now the Birs-Nimrud, had seven stages, symbolical of the seven concentric circles of the seven spheres, each built of tiles and metals to correspond with the colour of the ruling planet of the sphere typified. These are all “remnants of paganism” we are told—traces “of the superstitions of old, which, like the owls and bats in a dark subterranean [cave], flew away to return no more before the glorious light of Christianity”—a statement but too easy of refutation. If the author of the article in question has collected hundreds of instances to show that not only the Christians of old but even the modern Christians have preserved the number seven , and as sacredly as it ever was before, there might be found in reality thousands . To begin with the astronomical and religious calculation of old of the pagan Romans, who divided the week into seven days, and held the seventh day as the most sacred, the Sol or Sun- day of Jupiter, and to which all the Christian nations—especially the Protestants—make puja to this day. If, perchance, we are answered that it is not from the pagan Romans but from the monotheistic Jews that we have it, then why is not the Saturday or the real “Sabbath” kept instead of the Sunday, or Sol ’ s day?"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"T HE N UMBER S EVEN  411 If in the Râmâyana seven yards are mentioned in the residences of the Indian kings; and seven gates generally led to the famous temples and cities of old, then why should the Frieslanders have in the tenth century of the Christian era strictly adhered to the number seven in dividing their provinces, and insisted upon paying seven “pfennigs” of contribution? The Holy Roman and Christian Empire had seven Kurfürsts or Electors. The Hungarians emigrated under the leadership of seven dukes and founded seven towns, now called Semigradye (now Transylvania) . If pagan Rome was built on seven hills, Constantinople had seven names Byzantium, Antonia, New Rome, the town of Constantine, The Separator of the World’s Parts, The Treasure of Islam, Stamboul—and was also called the city on the seven Hills, and the city of seven Towers as an adjunct to others. With the Mussulmans “it was besieged seven times and taken after seven weeks by the seventh of the Osman Sultans.” In the ideas of the Eastern peoples, the seven planetary spheres are represented by the seven rings worn by the women on seven parts of the body—the head, the neck, the hands the feet, in the ears, in the nose, around the waist—and these seven rings or circles are presented to this time by the Eastern suitors to their brides; the beauty of the woman consisting in the Persian songs of seven charms. The seven planets ever remaining at an equal distance from each other, and rotating in the same path, hence, the idea suggested by this motion, of the eternal harmony of the universe. In this connection the number seven became especially sacred with them, and ever preserved its importance with the astrologers. The Pythagoreans considered the figure seven as the image and model of the divine order and harmony in nature. It was the number containing twice the sacred number three or the “triad,” to which the “one” or the divine monad was added: 3 + 1 + 3. As the harmony of nature sounds on the k ey-boar d of space, between the seven planets, so the harmony of audible sound takes place on a smaller plan within the musical scale of the ever-recurring seven tones.

Consisting of a union between the number three (the symbol of the divine triad with all and every people, Christian as well as pagans) and of four (the symbol of the cosmic forces or elements), the number seven points out symbolically to the union of the Deity with the universe; this Pythagorean idea was applied by the Christians especially during the Middle Ages—who largely used the number seven in the symbolism of their sacred architecture. So, for instance, the famous Cathedral of Cologne and the Dominican Church at Regensburg display this number in the smallest architectural details."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"No less an importance has this mystical number in the world of intellect and philosophy. Greece had seven sages, the Christian Middle Ages seven free arts (grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). The (Mohammedan) Sheikh-ul-Islam calls in for every important meeting seven “ulemas.” In the Middle Ages an oath had to be taken before seven witnesses, and the one to whom it was administered was sprinkled seven times with blood. The processions around the temples went seven times, and the devotees had to kneel seven times before uttering a vow. The Mohammedan pilgrims turn around Kaaba seven times, at their arrival. The sacred vessels were made of gold and silver purified seven times. The localities of the old German tribunals were designated by seven trees, under which were placed seven “Schoffers” (judges) who required seven witnesses. The criminal was threatened with a seven-fold punishment, and a seven -fold purification was required as a seven -fold reward was promised to the virtuous. Everyone knows the great importance placed in the West on the seventh son of a seventh son. All the mythic personages are generally endowed with seven sons. In Germany, the king and now the emperor cannot refuse to stand as god-father to a seventh son, if he be even a beggar. In the East in making up for a quarrel or signing a treaty T HE N UMBER S EVEN  413 o f p e a c e , t he rulers exchange either seven or forty-nine (7 x 7) presents. To attempt to cite all the things included in this mystical number would require a library. We will close by quoting but a few more from the region of the demoniacal. According to authorities in those matters—the Christian clergy of old—a contract with the devil had to contain seven paragraphs, was concluded for seven years and signed by the contractor seven times; all the magical drinks prepared with the help of the enemy of man consisted of seven herbs; that lottery ticket wins, which is drawn out by a seven- year-old child. Legendary wars lasted seven years, seven months and seven days; and the combatant heroes number seven , seventy , seven hundred , seven thousand , and seventy thousand . The princesses in the fairy tales remained seven years under a spell, and the boots of the famous cat—the Marquis de Carabas—were seven-leagued . The ancients divided the human frame into seven parts; the head, the chest, the stomach, two hands and two feet; and man’s life was divided into seven periods. A baby begins teething in the seventh month; a child begins to sit after fourteen months (2 x 7); begins to walk after twenty-one months (3 x 7); to speak after twenty-eight months (4 x 7); leaves off sucking after thirty-five (5 x 7); at fourteen years (2 x 7) he begins to finally form himself; at twenty-one (3 x 7) he ceases growing. The average height of a man, before mankind degenerated, was seven feet; hence the old Western laws ordering the garden walls to be seven feet high. The education of the boys began with the Spartans and the old Persians at the age of seven . And in the Christian religions—with the Roman Catholics and the Greeks—the child is not held responsible for any crime till he is seven , and it is the proper age for him to go to confession."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"If the Hindus will think of their Manu and recall what the old ® astras contain, beyond doubt they will find the origin of all this symbolism.

It was so quick that he could not distinguish the hand, and as the object was worth not above a few rupees, his first thought shared subsequently by all of us was that it was an act of pure malice. This suspicion was in a measure warranted by the disgraceful behaviour of the native Christian party on the preceding evening at the Town Hall, where Colonel Olcott lectured to an audience which we believed was to have been composed only of gentlemen.

This once, contrary to the rule, it is the men of science themselves who take it up. Statistics of events of the most varied nature are fast being collected and collated with the seriousness demanded by important scientific questions. Statistics of wars and of the periods (or cycles) of the appearance of great men—at least those as have been recognized as such by their contemporaries and irrespective of later opinions; statistics of the periods of development and progress at large commercial centres; of the rise and fall of arts and sciences of cataclysms, such as earthquakes, epidemics; periods of extraordinary cold and heat; cycles of revolutions, and of the rise and fall of empires, etc.; all these are subjected in turn to the analysis of the minutest mathematical calculations. Finally, even the occult significance of numbers in names of persons and names of cities, in events, and like matters, receives unwonted attention. If, on the one hand, a great portion of the educated public is running into atheism and scepticism, on the other hand, we find an evident current of mysticism forcing its way into science. It is the sign of an irrepressible need in humanity to assure itself that there is a Power Paramount over matter; an occult and mysterious law which governs the world, and which we T HE T HEORY OF C YCLES  419 should r a ther study and closely watch, trying to adapt ourselves to it, than blindly deny, and break our heads against the rock of destiny. More than one thoughtful mind, while studying the fortunes and reverses of nations and great empires, has been deeply struck by one identical feature in their history, namely, the inevitable recurrence of similar historical events reaching in turn every one of them, and after the same lapse of time. This analogy is found between the events to be substantially the same on the whole, though there may be more or less difference as to the outward form of details. Thus, the belief of the ancients in their astrologers, soothsayers, and prophets might have been warranted by the verification of many of their most important predictions, without these prognostications of future events implying of necessity anything very miraculous in"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"themselves. The soothsayers and augurs having occupied in days of the old civilizations the very same position now occupied by our historians, astronomers, and meteorologists, there was nothing more wonderful in the fact of the former predicting the downfall of an empire or the loss of a battle, than in the latter predicting the return of a comet, a change of temperature, or, perhaps, the final conquest of Afghanistan. The necessity for both these classes being acute observers apart, there was the study of certain sciences to be pursued then as well as they are now . The science of today will have become an “ancient” science a thousand years hence. Free and open, scientific study now is to all, whereas it was then confined but to the few. Yet, whether ancient or modern, both may be called exact sciences; for, if the astronomer of today draws his observations from mathematical calculations, the astrologer of old also based his prognostications upon no less acute and mathematically correct observations of the ever-recurring cycles. And, because the secret of this science is now being lost, does that give any warrant to say that it never existed, or that, to believe in it, one must be ready to swallow “magic,” “miracles,” and the like stuff? “If, in view of the eminence to which modern science has reached, the claim to prophesy future events must be regarded as either a child’s play or 420  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS a deliberate deception,” says a writer in the Novoye Vremya , the be s t daily paper of literature and politics of St. Petersburg, “then we can point at science which, in its turn, has now taken up and placed on record the question, in its relation to past events, whether there is or is not in the constant repetition of events a certain periodicity; in other words, whether these events recur after a fixed and determined period of years with every nation; and if a periodicity there be, whether this periodicity is due to blind chance or depends on the same natural laws, on which are more or less dependent many of the phenomena of human life.” Undoubtedly the latter. And the writer has the best mathematical proof of it in the timely appearance of such works as that of Dr. E. Zasse, under review, and of a few others. Several learned works, treating upon this mystical subject, have appeared of late, and of some of these works and calculation, we will now treat; the more readily as they are in most cases from the pens of men of eminent learning. Having already in the June number of The Theosophist noticed an article by Dr. Blochvitz, “On the Significance of the Number Seven,” with every nation and people—a learned paper which appeared lately in the German journal Die Gegenwart— we will now summarize the opinions of the press in general, on a more suggestive work by a well-known German scientist, E. Zasse, with certain reflections of our own. It has just appeared in the Prussian Journal of Statistics , and powerfully corroborates the ancient theory of Cycles. These periods which bring around ever-recurring events, begin from the infinitesimally small—say of ten years—rotation and reach to cycles which require 250, 500 700, and 1000 years, to effect their revolution around themselves, and within one another. All are contained within the Mahâ-Yuga , the “Great Age” or Cycle of the Manu calculation, which itself revolves between two eternities—the “Pralayas” or"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Nights of Brahmâ . As, in the objective world of matter, or the system of effects, the minor constellations and planets gravitate each and all around the sun, so in the world of the subjective, or the system of causes, these innumerable cycles all gravitate T HE T HEORY OF C YCLES  421 between t hat which the finite intellect of the ordinary mortal regards as eternity, and the still finite, but more profound, intuition of the sage and philosopher views as but an eternity within T HE E TERNITY . “As above, so it is below, runs the old Hermetic maxim. As an exp e riment in this direction, Dr. Zasse selected the statistical investigations of all the wars, the occurrence of which has been recorded in history, as a subject which lends itself more easily to scientific verification than any other. To illustrate his subject in the simplest and most easily comprehensible way, Dr. Zasse represents the periods of war and the periods of peace in the shape of small and large wave-lines running over the area of the old world. The idea is not a new one, for the image was used for similar illustrations by more than one ancient and mediaeval mystic, whether in words or picture—by Henry Khunrath, for example. But it serves well its purpose and gives us the facts we now want. Before he treats, however, of the cycles of wars, the author brings in the record of the rise and fall of the world’s great empires, and shows the degree of activity they have played in the Universal History. He points out the fact that if we divide the map of the Old World into five parts—into Eastern, Central and Western Asia, Eastern and Western Europe, and Egypt—then we will easily perceive that every 250 years, an enormous wave passes over these areas, bringing into each in its turn the events it has brought to the one next preceding. This wave we may call “the historical wave” of the 250 years’ cycle. The reader will please follow this mystical number of years. The first of these waves began in China, 2,000 years B.C.—the “golden age” of this Empire, the age of philosophy; of discoveries and reforms. In 1750 B.C., the Mongolians of Central Asia established a powerful empire. In 1500, Egypt rises from its te mporary degradation and carries its sway over many parts of Europe and Asia; and about 1250, the historical wave reaches and crosses over to Eastern Europe, filling it with the spirit of the Argonautic expedition, and dies out in 1000 B.C. at the siege of Troy. 422  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS A second historical wave appears about that time in Central Asia. The Scythians leave her steppes, and inundate towards the year 750 B.C. the adjoining countries, directing th emselves towards the South and West; about the year 500 in Western Asia begins an epoch of"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"splendour for ancient Persia; and the wave moves on to the east of Europe, where about 250 B.C. Greece reaches her highest state of culture and civilization—and further on to the West, where, at the birth of Christ, the Roman Empire finds itself at its apogee of power and greatness. Again, at this period we find the rising of a third historical wave at the far East. After prolong e d revolutions, about this time, China forms once more a powerful empire, and its arts, sciences, and commerce flourish again. Then 250 years later, we find the Huns appearing from the depths of Central Asia; in the year 500 A.D . a new and powerful Persian k ingdom is formed; in 750—in Eastern Europe—the Byzantine empire; and, in the year 1,000—on its Western side springs up the second Roman Power, the Empire of the Papacy, which soon reaches an extraordinary development of wealth and brilliancy. At the same time, the fourth wave approaches from the Orient. China is again flourishing; in 1250, the Mongolian wave from Central Asia has overflowed and covered an enormous area of land, including with it Russia. About 1500, in Western Asia, the Ottoman Empire rises in all its might and conquers the Balkan peninsula; but at the same time in Eastern Europe, Russia throws off the Tatar yoke, and about 1750, during the reign of Empress Catherine, rises to an unexpected grandeur and covers itself with glory. The wave ceaselessly moves further on to the West, and beginning with the middle of the past century, Europe is living over an epoch of revolutions and reforms, and, according to the author, “if it is permissible to prophetize, then, about the year 2,000 Western Europe will have lived one of those periods of culture and progress so rare in history.” The Russian press, taking the cue believes that “towards those days the Eastern Question will be finally settled, the national dissensions of the European peoples will come to an end, and the dawn of the new millennium will witness T HE T HEORY OF C YCLES  423 t h e a b o l i shment of armies and an alliance between all the European empires.” The signs of regeneration are also fast multiplying in Japan and China, as if pointing to the approach of a new historical wave at the extreme East. If from the cycle of two-and-a-half-century duration, we descend to those which leave their impress every century, and grouping together the events of ancient history, will mark the development and rise of empires, then we will assure ourselves that, beginning from the year 700 B.C ., the centennial wave pushes forward, bringing into promine n ce the following nations—each in its turn—the Assyrians, the Medes, the Babylonians, the Persians, the Greeks, the Macedonians, the Carthaginians, the Romans, and the Germanians. The striking periodicity of the wars in Europe is also noticed by Dr. E. Zasse. Beginning with 1700 A.D ., every ten years have been signalized by either a war or a revolut i on. The periods of the strengthening and weakening of the warlike excitement of the European nations represent a wave strikingly regular in its periodicity, flowing incessantly, as if propelled onward by some invisible fixed law. This same mysterious law seems at the same time to make these events coincide with [the] astronomical wave"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"or cycle, which, at every new revolution, is accompanied by the very marked appearance of spots in the sun. The periods, when the European powers have shown the most destructive energy, are marked by a cycle of 50 years’ duration. It would be too long and tedious to enumerate them from the beginning of History. We may, therefore, limit our study to the cycle beginning with the year 1712, when all the European nations were fighting at the same time—the Northern, and the Turkish Wars, and the war for the throne of Spain. About 1761, the “Seven Years’ War”; in 1810 the wars of Napoleon I. Towards 1861, the wave has a little deflected from its regular course, but, as if to compensate for it, or, propelled, perhaps, with unusual force, the years directly preceding, as well as those which followed it, left in history the records of the most fierce and bloody war—the Crimean War—in the former period, and the American Rebellion in 424  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS the latter one. The periodicity in the wars between Russia and Turkey appears peculiarly s t r i k i n g and represents a very characteristic wave. At first the intervals between the cycles, returning upon themselves, are of thirty years’ duration—1710, 1740, 1770; then these intervals diminish, and we have a cycle of twenty years—1790, 1810, 1829-30; then the intervals widen again—1853 and 1878. But, if we take note of the whole duration of the in-flowing tide of the warlike cycle, then we will have at the centre of it—from 1768 to 1812—three wars of seven years’ duration each, and, at both ends, wars of two years. Finally, the author comes to the conclusion that, in view of facts, it becomes thoroughly impossible to deny the presence of a regular periodicity in the excitement of both mental and physical forces in the nations of the world. He proves that in the history of all the peoples and empires of the Old World, the cycles marking the millenniums, the centennials as well as the minor ones of 50 and 10 years’ duration, are the most important, inasmuch as neither of them has ever yet failed to bring in its rear some more or less marked event in the history of the nation swept over by these historical waves. The history of India is one which, of all histories, is the most vague and least satisfactory. Yet, were its consecutive great events noted down, and its annals well searched, the law of cycles would be found to have asserted itself here as plainly as in every other country in respect of its wars, famines, political exigencies, and other matters. In France, a meteorologist of Paris went to the trouble of compiling the statistics of the coldest seasons, and discovered, at the same time, that those years, which had the figure 9 in them, had been marked by the severest winters. His figures run thus: in 859 A.D ., the northern part of the Adriatic Sea was frozen and was covered for three months with ice . I n 1179, in the most moderate zones, the earth was covered with several feet of snow. In 1209, in France, the depth of snow and the bitter cold caused such a scarcity of"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"fodder that most of the cattle perished in that T HE T HEORY OF C YCLES  425 country . I n 1249, the Baltic Sea, between Russia, Norway, and Sweden, remained frozen for many months and communication was held by sleighs. In 1339, there was such a terrific winter in England, that vast numbers of people died of starvation and exposure. In 1409, the River Danube was frozen from its sources to its mouth in the Black Sea. In 1469, all the vineyards and orchards perished in consequence of the frost. In 1609, in France, Switzerland, and Upper Italy, people had to thaw their bread and provisions before they could use them. In 1639, the harbour of Marseilles was covered with ice to a great distance. In 1659, all the rivers in Italy were frozen. In 1699, the winter in France and Italy proved the severest and longest of all. The prices for articles of food were so much raised that half of the population died of starvation. In 1709, the winter was no less terrible. The ground was frozen in France, Italy, and Switzerland, to the depth of several feet, and the sea, south as well as north, was covered with one compact and thick crust of ice, many feet deep, and for a considerable space of miles, in the usually open sea. Masses of wild beasts, driven out by the cold from their dens in the forest, sought refuge in villages and even cities; and the birds fell dead to the ground by hundreds. In 1729, 1749, and 1769 (cycles of 20-years’ duration), all the rivers and streams were icebound all over France for many weeks, and all the fruit trees perished. In 1789, France was again visited by a very severe winter. In Paris, the thermometer stood at 19 degrees of frost. But the severest of all winters proved that of 1829. For fifty-four consecutive days, all the roads in France were covered with snow several feet deep, and all the rivers were frozen. Famine and misery reached their climax in the country in that year. In 1839, there was again in France a most terrific and trying cold season. And now the winter of 1879 has asserted its statistical rights and proved true to the fatal influence of the figure 9. The meteorologists of other countries are invited to follow suit and make their investigations likewise, for the subject is certainly one of the most fascinating as well as instructive kind. Enough has been shown, however, to prove that neither 426  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS the ideas of Pythagoras on the mysterious influence of numbers, nor the theories of ancient w orld-religions and philosophies are as shallow and meaningless as some too forward free-thinkers would have had the world to believe. ————"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME II 1880 OUR SECOND YEAR [ The Theosophist , Vol. I, No . 11, August, 1880, pp. 261-262] Like all other pleasant things, our first year’s relations with The Theosophist ’ s subscri bers are about to terminate. The present is the eleventh number, that has been issued under the contract, and the September one will be the twelfth and last. Thus every engagement assumed by the proprietors of the magazine has been honourably and literally fulfilled. It would seem as though they were entitled to the acknowledgement of this much even from those croakers who prophesied the total, probably speedy, collapse of the enterprise, both before and after the first number appeared. The case of The Theosophist calls for a word or two of particular comment. Even in any large city of Europe or America, it is a very rare thing for a periodical of this stamp to survive the natural indifference or hostility of the public for a whole year. Out of scores of attempts made within our own recollection, the successes are so few as to be scarcely worth mentioning. As a rule their term of existence has been in exact ratio with the lump sum their projectors have been ready to spend upon them. In India the prospect was far worse; for the people are poor, cut up into innumerable castes, not accustomed to take in periodicals, and certainly not to patronize those put forth by foreigners. Besides, and especially, the custom has always been to give two, three, and even more years’ credit to subscribers, and O UR S ECOND Y EAR  427 e v e r y I n d ian publication advertises its respective cash and credit terms of subscription. All this we knew, and both Anglo-Indian and Native journalists of the largest experience warned us to anticipate failure; under no circumstances, they thought, would it be possible for us to make succeed among so apathetic a people so strange a magazine, even though we should give unlimited credit. But as our object was not profit, and as the Society badly needed such an organ, we decided to make the venture. A sum large enough to pay the entire cost of the magazine for one year was set aside, and the first number appeared promptly on the day announced—October 1st, 1879. Believing that the credit system was absolutely pernicious, and having seen the universal adoption in America of the plan of cash payment in advance and its unmixed advantages, we announced that the latter would be the rule of this office. The results are already known to our readers: in the fourth month the magazine reached, and before the half year was gone, passed that ticklish point where income and expenses balance each other, and its success was an assured fact. Many subscribers have been so anxious to have us succeed that they have sent us their money to pay for the magazine two years in advance, and"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"others have told us we may count upon their patronage as long as they may live. It goes without saying that the projectors of The Theosophist have been inexpressibly delighted with the affectionate response to their appeal to the Asiatic people for support in an attempt to snatch from the dust of oblivion the treasures of Aryan wisdom. What heart that was not made of stone could be untouched by so much devotion as has been shown us and our sacred cause of human brotherhood? And it is our pride and joy to realize that all these friends have clustered around us, even when we were under the heavy burden of the suspicions of the Indian Government, because they have believed us to be sincere and true, the friends and brothers of the ardent sons of Asia. If our first year began in uncertainty, it doses all bright and full of promise. Where our magazine had one well-wisher then, now it has twenty, and by the beginning of the third year 428  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS will have fifty. It has become a necessity to hundreds of young Aryan patriots, who love t o k n o w w h at their ancestors were, so that they may at least dream of emulating them. It has won a place in the regard of even Anglo-Indians, of which class many in influential positions take it. Its merits as an Oriental magazine have been acknowledged by a number of the first Orientalists of Europe, who have been by it introduced for the first time to some of the most learned of Asiatic priests, pandits and Shastris . In another place, in this number, will be found a few of the kind words that have been said to and about us, at this and the other side of the world. As to our present standing with the Government of India, the letter from the ex-Viceroy, Lord Lytton, and the leading article of The Pioneer (printed respectively in the February and June numbers), as well as the appeal from the Director of Agriculture, N.-W.P. for help, which appeared in June, make all plain. In short, the Theosophical Society, and its organ, The Theosophist , are now so firmly established that—entirely apart from the splendid results of the mission to Ceylon, treated elsewhere in a separate article—every lover of truth may well rejoice. Were we inclined to boasting we might hold out very attractive inducements to subscribers for the second volume. We prefer to let our past performance stand as guarantee of what we will do in the future. We have engaged so many valuable articles by the best writers of Asia, Europe, and America that we have no hesitancy in promising that The Theosophist of 1880-81 will be still more interesting and instructive than it has been for 1879-80. Naturally, the Ceylon voyage, and the taking into the Theosophical Society of every Buddhist priest in the Island of any reputation for ability or learning, will lead to such a complete exposition of Buddhism in these columns, by the men best qualified to speak, as must arrest universal attention.

Some thr e e months ago, the Yankee-Irish editor of a unimportant, third-class Anglo-Indian paper, in a fit, apparently of delirium tremens , with abuse and low slander, called us a “Spiritualist.” The epithet was thrown into our teeth under the evident impression that, in the eyes of the scepticaI public, at least, it would overwhelm us. The mark was missed that time. If, to believe in the reality of numberless phenomena, produced for long years under our own eyes, in almost every country, and under the most satisfactory test conditions, precluding all possibility of trickery, 430  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS constitutes one a “Spiritualist,” then in company with a host of the most eminent men of learnin g , we plead guilty. But if, on the other hand, we take Webster’s definition that a Spiritualist is “one who believes in direct intercourse with departed spirits, through the agency of persons called mediums ,” then it was a stupid blunder that the editor committed. Whether rightly or wrongly, we do not attribute the phenomena we believe in to the agency of “spirits” that are the souls of the departed. This is not the occasion to expound our personal theory. For, to begin, there are but few Spiritualists who are unacquainted with it; and our present object being to draw the attention of every sensible person to just such phenomena as the orthodox Spiritualists attribute to spirits, it matters little to whatever cause we personally may attribute them. Earnest and indomitable searchers after truth, and wanting only the T RUTH , none of us, Theosophists, claim infalli b ility or set ourselves to dogmatizing. We are no sectarians, and most of us, if not all are honestly open to conviction. Let anyone prove to us an alleged fact to be really one, and we are willing to accept it as a dogma any day.

But there are certain points in it, in which I cannot but join issue with you. In order to account for the most striking resemblances that existed in the manners, customs, social habits and traditions of the primitive peoples of the two worlds, you have recourse to the old Platonic theory of a land-connection between them. But the recent researches in the Novemyra* have once for all exploded that theory. They prove that, with the exception of the severance of Australia from Asia, there never was a submersion of land on so gigantic a scale as to produce an Atlantic or a Pacific Ocean, that, ever since their formation, the seas have never changed their ancient basins on any very large scale. Professor Geikie, in his physical geography, holds that the continents have always occupied the positions they do now, except that, for a few miles, their coasts have sometimes advanced into and receded from the sea. You would not have fallen into any error. had you accepted M. de Quatrefages’ theory of migrations by sea. The plains of Central Asia are accepted by all monogenists as the centre of appearance of the human race. From this place successive waves of emigrants radiated to the utmost verge of the world. It is no wonder that the ancient Chinese, Hindus, Egyptians, Peruvians, and Mexicans—men who once inhabited the same place—should show the strong resemblances in certain points of their life. The proximity of the two continents at Behring Straits enabled immigrants to pass from Asia to America. A little to the south is the current of Tassen, the Kouro-sivo or black stream of the Japanese, which opens a great route for Asiatic ————— * [It is not certain what particular journal or newspaper is meant here.

Paz Soldan informs us in his Geografía del Perú , a little colony there; and Buddhist missionaries “towards the close of the fifth century sent religious missions to carry to Fou-Sang (America) the doctrines of Buddha.” This will no doubt be unpleasant to many European readers. They are averse to crediting a statement that takes the honour of the discovery of America from them and assigns it to what they are graciously pleased to call “a semi-barbarous Asiatic nation.” Nevertheless, it is an unquestionable truth. Chapter XVIII of The Human Species , by A. de Quatrefages will be an interesting reading to any one who may be eager to know something of the Chinese discovery of America, but the space at his command being small, he gives a very meagre account of it in his book. I earnestly hope you will complete your interesting article by adverting to this and giving as full particulars of all that is known about it. The shedding of light on a point which has hitherto been involved in mysterious darkness, will not be unworthy of the pen of one, the be-all and end-all of whose life is the search of truth and. when found. to abide by it. be it at whatever cost it may be. A MRITA L AL B ISVAS Calcutta , 11 th J uly . Scant leisure this month prevents our making any detailed answer to the objections to the At l antean hypothesis intelligently put forth by our subscriber. But let us see whether—even though based upon “recent researches” which “have once for all exploded that theory”—they are as formidable as at first sight they may appear. Without entering into the subject too deeply, we may limit ourselves to but one brief remark. More than one scientific question, which at one time has seemingly been put at rest forever, has exploded at a subsequent one over the heads of theorists who had forgotten the danger of trying to elevate a simple theory into an infallible dogma. We have not questioned the assertion that “there never was a submersion of land on so gigantic a scale as to produce an A L AND OF M YSTERY  433 Atlanti c or a Pacific Ocean,” for we never pretended to suggest new theories for the formation of oceans. The latter may have been where they now are since the time of their first appearance, and yet whole continents been broken into fragments partially engulfed, and left innumerable islands, as seems the case with the submerged Atlantis. What we meant was that, at some pre-historic time and long after the globe teemed with civilized nations, Asia, America, and perhaps Europe were parts of one vast continental formation, whether united by such narrow strips of land as evidently once existed where now is Behring Strait (which connects the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans and has a depth of hardly more than twenty to twenty-five fathoms), or by larger stretches of land. Nor shall we fight the monogenists who claim Central Asia as the one cradle place of humanity—but leave the task to the polygenists who are able to do it far more successfully than ourselves. But, in any case, before we can accept the theory of monogenesis, its advocates must offer us some unanswerable hypothesis to account for the observed differences in human types better than that of “divarication caused by difference of climate, habits, and religious culture .” Mr. de Ouatrefages may remain, as"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"ever, indisputably a most distinguished naturalist—physician, chemist, and zoologist—yet we fail to understand why we should accept his theories in preference to all others. Mr. Amrita Lal Bisvas evidently refers to a narrative of some scientific travels along the shores of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, by this eminent Frenchman, entitled Souvenirs d ’ un Naturaliste . He seems to regard Mr. de Quatrefages in the light of an infallible Pope upon all scientific questions: we do not, though he was a member of the French Academy and a professor of ethnology. His theory about the migrations by sea, may be offset by about an hundred others which directly oppose it. It is just because we have devoted our whole life to the research of truth—for which complimentary admission we thank our critic—that we never accept on faith any authority upon any question whatsoever; nor, pursuing, as we do, T RUTH and progress through a full and fearles s enquiry, 434  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS untrammelled by any consideration, would we advise any of our friends to do otherwise. Having s a id so much, we may now give a few of our reasons for believing in the alleged “fable” of the submerged Atlantis—though we explained ourselves at length upon the subject in Isis Unveiled (Vol. I, pp. 590, et seq .). 1. We have as evidence the most ancient traditions of various and widely-separated peoples—legends in India, in ancient Greece, Madagascar, Sumatra, Java, and all the principal isles of Polynesia, as well as those of both Americas. Among savages, as in the traditions of the richest literature in the world—the Sanskrit literature of India—there is an agreement in saying that, ages ago, there existed in the Pacific Ocean, a large continent which, by a geological upheaval, was engulfed by the sea. And it is our firm belief—held, of course, subject to correction—that most, if not all of the islands from the Malayan Archipelago to Polynesia, are fragments of that once immense submerged continent. Both Malacca and Polynesia, which lie at the two extremities of the Ocean and which, since the memory of man, never had nor could have any intercourse with, or even a knowledge of each other, have yet a tradition, common to all the islands and islets, that their respective countries extended far, far out into the sea; that there were in the world but two immense continents, one inhabited by yellow, the other by dark men; and that the ocean, by command of the gods and to punish them for their incessant quarrelling, swallowed them up. 2. Notwithstanding the geographical fact that New Zealand, and Sandwich, and Easter Islands, are at a distance, from each other, of between 800 and 1,000 leagues; and that, according to every testimony, neither these nor any other intermediate islands, for instance, the Marquesan, Society, Fijian, Tahitian, Samoan, and other islands, could, since they became islands, ignorant as their people were of the compass, have communicated with each other before the arrival of Europeans; yet, they, one and all, maintain that their respective countries extended far toward the West, on the Asian side. Moreover, with very small"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"T HE B EWITCHED M IRROR  435 differen ces, they all speak dialects evidently of the same language and understand each other with little difficulty; have the same religious beliefs and superstitions; and pretty much the same customs. And as few of the Polynesian islands were discovered earlier than a century ago, and the Pacific Ocean itself was unknown to Europe until the days of Columbus, and these islanders have never ceased repeating the same old traditions since the Europeans first set foot on their shores, it seems to us a logical inference that our theory is nearer to the truth than any other. Chance would have to change its name and meaning, were all this due but to chance alone. ———— "},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME II 1880 [THE BEWITCHED MIRROR] [ The Theosophist , Vol. I, N o . 11, August, 1880, p. 284] [In The Theosophist of June, 1880, p. 230, there appeared an account of an experiment made by A. Tzeretelef. He had heard that “to stand alone at midnight before a mirror, with two lighted candles in one’s hands, and to repeat three times loudly and slowly one’s own name,” was a most terrifying experience. He proceeded to do exactly as he had been told. After twice calling his name, meanwhile gazing firmly at his reflection in the mirror, he became suddenly filled with terror upon realizing that his reflection had disappeared, while all the other objects were faithfully reflected. He tried desperately to utter his name for the third time, but failed. After that, he knew no more until next morning when he became conscious that he was in his own bed with a servant standing at his side. The same experiment was tried by Babu Asu Tosh Mittra, who proceeded exactly according to the same method, but without results. He repeated the experiment on three subsequent nights, but in vain. He expresses his wish to know if anyone else has tried it and thinks that “it might be that the effects described happen only with certain persons.” To this H. P.

If his and his friend’s tests prove nothing else, they certainly show that not everyone, who invokes himself in a mirror at midnight by the light of two candles, will, of necessity, be appalled by ghostly apparitions. But his own common sense has probably suggested what is no doubt the fact of the case, viz., that the phenomena described by Prince Tzeretelef, in our June number, are observable only by persons of a peculiar temperament. This is certainly the rule in every other department of psychic phenomena.

The miscreant knocked down his victim, and then cut his throat with a knife which he had brought ashore purposely to kill some one with. He was tried and convicted, but recommended to mercy by the jury. But the Court, reprimanding the jurors for a recommendation so utterly uncalled for under the circumstances, gave sentence; and the Government of India, upon being appealed to, very sensibly and justly affirmed the decision of the Court. Well, this red-handed murderer was hung, the other day, and his body interred at the Scotch Burial Ground, Calcutta. The Indian Daily News says: There were present at the cemetery, some time before the funeral cortège ar rived, about fifty ladies and gentlemen. On the arrival of S OBS , S ODS AND P OSIES  437 the hearse, the coffin, which bore the inscription of “George Nairns, executed July 23rd, 1880, aged 29 years,” was covered by an Union Jack, and was shouldered by six of Nairns’ shipmates, and carried to the foot of the grave. The Rev. Mr. Gillan officiated, and in the first instance read out those portions of scripture which Nairns was most fond of hearing read to him after his condemnation. He then referred in general to the terms of the statement made by Nairns on the scaffold, and more particularly addressing the sailors present, he warned them to take example from the fate which had befallen Nairns, and earnestly advised them to avoid the low Native liquor shops. The usual prayers were then offered up. On the coffin being lowered into the grave, many a sod was thrown in pityingly, and many a merciful womanly hand flung in a bunch of flowers, and many a head was turned aside to wipe away a tear for the shameful end of a young man whose career had promised much better things. At the conclusion, the Rev. Mr. Godwin, assisted by several ladies who were present, sang the hymn, Safe in the Arms of Jesus . Who would not be a murderer of sepoys, after that! Fifty gushing ladies and gentlem a n; the Union Jack to enwrap one’s coffin; consoling texts read from the Bible, his favourites after his condemnation (cheap country liquor was his specialty before); sods thrown “pityingly” in—for good luck, doubtless, as slippers are thrown at weddings; sweet nosegays; and pearly tears raining down fair cheeks—what more could any respectable assassin demand?

At Bentota we were taken to a temple where a community of 500 of these Rahats , or adepts, had formerly resided. Nay, we even met those who had quite recently encountered such holy men; and a certain eminent priest, who joined our Society, was shortly after permitted to see and exchange some of our signs of recognition with one. It is true that, as in India and Egypt, there is a prevalent idea that the term for the manifestation of the highest grades of rahatship ( Rahat or Arahat is the Pali equivalent of the Sanskrit Rishi— one who has developed his psychical powers to their fullest extent) has expired, but this comes from a mistaken notion that Buddha himself had limited the period of such development to one millennium after his death.

On the 4th of July the Convention of Buddhist priests elsewhere alluded to by us, met at Galle, and listened to an address from Colonel Olcott upon the necessity of reviving Pali literature, and the special duty that rested upon them as its sole custodians. Thereupon they unanimously adopted a resolution to permanently organize as an Ecclesiastical Council under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, and every priest present, not previously initiated, applied for and was duly received into our Parent Society. This Convention was entirely composed of picked men—of such as were recognized to be leaders in their respective sects; hence by this one meeting the Society enormously increased its strength and prestige in all Buddhistic countries. The profound agitation, caused in Ceylon society by the visit of our Delegates, may be gauged by a single fact:—While we were there, three Christians of Galle were made insane by brooding over our arguments against the sufficiency of the basis of their religion. Poor things! their belief was evidently founded upon faith rather than logic. On the 10th of July we went by invitation to Welitara, a village between Galle and Colombo, to organize our seventh, and last, Buddhistic branch. As an illustration of the 440  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS thoughtful kindness shown us everywhere, we may mention that, though we were only to spend a f e w hours of daylight at Welitara, we found ready a large bungalow completely furnished, every article of furniture in which had been specially sent down from Colombo by the millionaire Mudalayar Mr. Sampson Rajapaksa. At this village, are the temples of two eminent priests, the Revs. Wimelasara and Dhammalankara, of the Amarapura sect. Besides founding the Welitara Theosophical Society—with Mr. Baltasar M.

N o one was ever more bitingly sarcastic or combative against what he called the “modern superstition.” The Russian press is now having a laugh at his expense. In an incautious moment, he suffered himself to be betrayed into an admission of some wonderful phenomena that had come under his personal knowledge some years ago. Treating, in the Golos , of the various superstitions of the Russian peasantry, he says that to them the “house-spook” ( domovoi ) or “house-keeper” ( hozyain ) — as this familiar spirit is also called—“has as perfect an objective reality, as the living persons about him. In it the peasant puts his trust, and takes it into consideration in every domestic affair.”—Then comes this confession:— I well remember that in my early manhood there was a learned old man, Stepan Andreyevich, celebrate d far and wide in all our neighbourhood, and even far beyond its boundaries. Before the magical achievements and occult powers of this son of the village deacon, before his weird knowledge and prophecies, our people literally prostrated themselves. He was not regarded as a practitioner of black art, but as a benevolent magician; he was simply credited with the performance of the most astounding miracles. He would see and describe to others events transpiring many miles off: he prophesied the day of his own death, and that of various well-known land-owners in our neighbourhood; at a single word from him, a whole pack of wild dogs, that were tearing after a carriage, fell dead in their tracks: at Orel, he evoked, at her prayer, the shade of a widow’s deceased husband, and discovered where he had hidden"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"some important family papers. As for all manner of illnesses, it was as though he drove them away with a wave of his hand. It was positively said that one lady had paid him 17,000 rubles for curing a case of lunacy; and it was alleged with like positiveness that he had been taken more than once to Moscow and other towns, to cure wealthy invalids. Hysterical diseases yielded to a single touch or even glance of his. In our own house, he relieved an obsessed woman by simply causing her to drink twelve bottles of some infusion of herbs. The obsessed creature would feel beforehand the approach of Stepan Andreyevich; she would be thrown into terrible convulsions and scream loud enough to be heard in the village—‘he comes. he comes! . . .’ As if the above were not wonderful enough, Mr. Markoff cites an instance which has quite re c ently come under his own observation, and in which he places a faith quite refreshing to behold in so uncompromising an opponent of 446  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS everything smacking of “superstition.” This is what he tells us:— In my cattle-yard, there is a superb young bull, purchased by me from a very wealthy breeder. This bull had n o progeny, strange to say, and I, believing it to be the keeper’s fault, rated him soundly for it. The intelligent muzhik would only doff his cap and, without replying. shake his head with an air of total disagreement with my opinion. “Eh! Master, master!” he once exclaimed, with an expression of deep conviction, “Did you not purchase the brute from a wealthy peasant ? How then can you ever expect that he should breed?” The fact is that a popular superstition in Russia assures that no rich breeder trading in fine cat t le, will ever sell a beast unless it has been made previously barren by the magic means of the “word” (a spell, or mantram). And Mr. Markoff, the great opponent of spiritualism, evidently shares in the superstition, since he adds the following profound reflection:— There are sufficiently strong reasons to believe that such exorcisms and spells are not merely limited to a “wo r d” but too evidently in many a case become “a deed.” ———— "},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME II 1880 THE DECADENCE OF PROTESTANT CHRISTIANITY [ The Theosophist , Vol. I, No. 12 , September, 1880, p. 309] Doubts have been expressed by Asiatic friends as to the truth of our assertion that Protesta ntism was fast approaching the crisis of its fate. Yet it needs only to visit any Protestant country to satisfy oneself of this fact.

The defences. which were effective against the noisy artillery of Paine, are useless against the noiseless and ceaseless sapping and mining with which Rationalism attacks them. Orthodox Protestantism shuts its eyes to the fact that science and literature are in the hands of its enemies. It refuses to perceive that the ground on which it stands is slipping from under its feet; that Germany, which, at the call of Luther, accepted the infallible Book in place of the self-styled infallible Church, has now rejected the Book, and that the new reformation, which reforms Christianity out of existence, is spreading all over the Protestant world. The result will, according to the Times , a c crue to the profit of the Romish Church. It foresees. in fact, that the latter may become “far stronger than she has been at any time since the Reformation.” Certainly the sudden outbreak of bigoted fervour over the pretended “miracles” in France and, more recently. Ireland, and the growing perversions of Anglican priests and laity show a decided drift in the direction indicated Men in the mass do not think but feel, are emotional rather than rational and go by flocks and swarms to that religion which most appeals to the emotions and imagination and least to the reason. That the whole area of Protestantdom is now ready to embrace some new faith which seems more consoling than Protestantism and more reasonable than Romanism, is so palpable and undeniable that no well-informed, disinterested observer will gainsay the statement. This conviction induced the founders of our Society to organize for the quest after primitive truth.

It was there stated that the German scientists are now giving attention to this manifestation of the numerical harmony and periodicity of the operations of T HE N UMBER S EVEN AND O UR S OCIETY  449 Nature. A s eries of statistical observations, embracing some centuries of historical events, tend to show that the ancients must have been perfectly aware of this law when constructing their systems of philosophy. In fact, when statistical science shall have been fully perfected, as it seems likely to be, there will be constantly increasing proofs that the evolution of heroes, poets, military chieftains, philosophers, theologians, great merchants, and all other remarkable personages, is as capable of mathematical estimate upon the basis of the potentiality of numbers, as the return of a comet by the rules of astronomical calculations. The comparatively modern system of life insurance rests upon the calculated expectancy of life on the average at certain ages; and, while nothing is so uncertain as the probable longevity of any single individual in a community, nothing is more certain than that the probable life-chance of any one person, in the mass of population, can be known on the basis of the general average of human life. In fact, as M. de Cazeneuve, in the Journal du Magnétisme , justly observes, the law of numerical proportions is verified in every department of the physical sciences. We see it in chemistry as the law of definite proportions and multiple proportions; in physics, as the law of optics, acoustics, electricity, etc.; in mineralogy, in the wonderful phenomena of crystallization; in astronomy, in the celestial mechanics. Well may the writer, above-quoted, remark: “Physical and moral laws have so infinitely numerous points of contact, that, if we have not as yet reached the point where we can demonstrate their identity, it is none the less certain that there exists between them a very great analogy.” We have attempted to show how, by a sort of common instinct, a peculiar solemnity and mystical significance has been given the Number Seven among all people, at all times.

It was only the other day that we began to take any note of the striking chain of circumstances, and some have only been recalled now at the moment of writing. The two chief founders of our Society were the President, Colonel Olcott, and the Conductor of this Magazine. When they made each other’s acquaintance (in 1874), the office number of the former was seven , the house number of the latter seven teen. The President’s Inaugural Address before the Society was delivered November 17, 1875; the Headquarters were established in the 47 th street (the uptown streets in New York are all designated by numbers), and Colonel Olcott’s office was removed to 71 Broadway. On the 17 th December, 1878, our delegates to India sailed for London; the voyage, owing to storms and fogs, lasted seven teen days; on the 17 th January, 1879, we left London for Liverpool to take the steamer for Bombay, got on board the next day, but lay all night in the Mersey, and on the l9th—the seven teenth day from our landing in England, we got to sea. On March 2— seven teen days after reaching Bombay—we removed to the bungalows where we have ever since been living.* On the 23rd March, thirty-five (7 x 5) days after landing, Colonel Olcott delivered his first public oration on Theosophy, at Framji Cowasji Institute, Bombay. July 7, the first Prospectus, announcing the intended foundation of The Theosophist was written; on the 27 th September, the first† “form” was made up at the printing-office, and on October 1—our 227 th in India—the magazine appeared. But we anticipate events. In the beginning of April, last year, Colonel Olcott and the Conductor of this Magazine went to the N.W.

We reached Point de G alle on the 17 th . At the first meeting in Ceylon of candidates for initiation, a group of seven persons presented themselves. At Panadure, seven were also initiated first, the evening proving so boisterous and stormy that the rest could not leave their houses. At Colombo, fourteen (7 x 2) were initiated the first night, while, at the preliminary meeting to organize the local branch temporarily, there were twenty -seven . At Kandy, seven teen comprised the first body of candidates. Returning to Colombo, we organized the “Lanka Theosophical Society,” a scientific branch, on the 17 th of the month, and on the evening when the Panadure branch was formed, thirty-five (7 x 5) names were registered as fellows. Seven priests were initiated here during this second visit, and at Bentota, where we tarried to organize a branch, there were again seven priests admitted. Thirty-five (7 x 5) members organized the Matara branch; and here again the priests taken into fellowship numbered seven . So, too, at Galle, twenty -seven persons were present on the night of the organization—the rest being unavoidably absent; and at Welitara the number was twenty-one , or three times seven . Upon counting up the entire number of lay Buddhists included in our seven Ceylon branches, that are devoted to the interests of that faith, we find our mystical number seven occupying the place of units, and what adds to the singularity of the fact is that the same is the case with the sum-total of priests who joined our Parent Society. Our septenary fatality followed us all throughout the return voyage to Bombay. Of the Delegation, two members, having urgent business, took an earlier steamer from Colombo, thus reducing our number to seven . Two more fully 452  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS intended to come home from Galle by the vessel of the 7th July, but, as it turned out, she did n o t touch there and so, perforce, our band of seven came together on the 12th—the fifty -seventh day after our landing. The sea voyage from Ceylon to Bombay may be said to begin upon leaving Colombo, since the run from Galle to that port is in Ceylonese waters. From friends—five laymen and two priests—again seven— who came aboard at Colombo to bid us farewell, we learned that the July Theosophist had reached there, and being naturally anxious to see a copy, urgently requested that one should be sent us to look at, if possible, before 5 o’clock P.M ., the hour at which it was thought w e would leave port. This was promised us, and, after our friends left, we watched every craft that came from shore. Five o’clock came, then six and half-past six, but no messenger or magazine for us. At last, precisely, at seven , one little canoe was seen tossing in the heavy sea that was running; she approached, was alongside; on her bows, painted on a white ground was the Number Seven ; a man climbed over the ship’s rail, and in his hand was the paper we were waiting for!

Going down the coast on our outward voyage, our steamer touched at fourteen (7 x 2) ports; coming home, our vessel, owing to the monsoon weather and the heavy surf along the Malabar Coast, visited only seven . And, finally, as though to show us that our septenate destiny was not to be evaded, it was exactly seven o’clock—as the log of the S . S .

The most superficial examination of the doctrine of chance will suffice to show that.

Knowing what gigantic strides biological science was making, we thought it could not be long before some scientific experiment would turn up, which would prove the possibility of such phenomena and wrest from sceptical science the confession of its previous ignorance. It now seems that we were not to he disappointed. A Reuter’s telegram from New York, dated August 7, apprised the world of the following stupendous event: Dr. Tanner, who announced his disbelief regarding medical theories about starvation, declaring he could live for forty days without food, and who began here his self-imposed task on the 28th June, completed it today, but is emaciated and exhausted.

These facts are discussed in a small pamphlet, published at Benares thirty years ago by an Anglo-Indian doctor, which, on account of its subject being so distasteful to the incredulous, failed to attract the attention of men of science at that time. It is through the obliging kindness of the venerable Pandit Lakshmi Narain Vyasa, of Allahabad, that we are enabled to reproduce for the instruction and gratification of our readers, from the copy in his possession, this, Dr. Paul’s excellent monograph on the Yoga Philosophy. Though written so long ago, and, of course containing none of the more recent speculations of science, yet this work has a distinct value as an honest attempt to explain, from the standpoint of a medical man, the reason for this, that, or the other of the Yogi’s stages of discipline; which, as we have shown, have been repudiated as “scientifically” A T REATISE ON T HE Y OGA P HILOSOPHY  455 i m p o s s i b le. But, as we cannot say that in every case the author has succeeded in making himself or his facts clearly understood, we venture to accompany the text with commentaries. And this with the double object in view of silencing at once the malicious accusation that our Society is no better than a school of “magic,” the word being used to signify ridiculous superstition and belief in supernaturalism and of preventing our readers from receiving wrong impressions in general. We are glad to say that the eighteen months passed by us in this country, and the twelve month existence of our journal, have not been fruitless in experience. For, during this period, we have learned at least one most important feature pertaining to the actual state of Hindu society. We find that the latter comprises two distinct parties, one, that of the free-thinkers, all -denying, sceptical, and wholly materialistic, whether of the Bradlaugh party, or the “modern school of thought”; the other, orthodox, bigoted, full of the unreasoning superstitions of the Brahmanical schools, and believing in anything if it only tallies with one or the other of the Puranas . Both the ne plus ultra of exaggeration and, as the saying goes, “each more Catholic than the Pope,” whether the latter is represented by Bradlaugh or the Caste Almighty, the most inflexible of gods. The few honourable exceptions go but to enforce the general rule. The Theosophical Society—whatever any inimical paper may say—knew why it was wanted in India, and came just in time to place itself between the above-named parties. Our journal, its organ, has from the beginning pursued the distinct policy of lending a friendly ear to both these parties, and biding its time to have its full say. By doing so it has puzzled many, given offense to a few—through no malice or fault of ours, though—but afforded instruction, we hope, to such as have had the wit to"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"understand its policy. And now that the end of the year is reached, we mean to commence our intended series of explanations by reprinting Dr. Paul’s treatise, from month to month, with a commentary upon the text as before stated. At the same time the 456  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS criticisms of all persons, learned in the Yoga, upon either Dr. Paul’s views or our own, are invi t ed. This Treatise mainly relates to the practices of the Hatha , not the Raja , Yoga—though the author has devoted to each a distinct chapter. We will notice the great difference between the two, later on. [In the introductory part of this series of articles, the author, Dr. N. C. Paul, explains that by the practice o f certain postures, and the subjection of the body to certain processes, the Hindu ecstatic acquires the power of abstaining from eating and breathing for long periods of time; the final objective being a state of self-induced trance during which the ecstatic experiences clairvoyant visions and a state of bliss. The successful practice of this form of Yoga is dependent upon the expiration and retention of carbonic acid within the body. Thus by the observance of every means of regulating the outflow of carbonic acid the ecstatic accomplishes his purpose. This outflow can be regulated in every normal function of the human organism and in every environment, according to Dr. Paul. He says, among other things: “The use of alcoholic liquor causes a considerable diminution in the amount of carbonic acid given out. The Aghoras, a sect of Hindu fakirs, consume a large quantity of alcoholic liquor in the course of the 24 hours.”] The Aghoras, or Aghora Panthas, can hardly be fairly compared with or even be said to f o llow any Yoga system at all, not even the Hatha Yoga. They are notorious for their filthy habits; eat carrion of various kinds, and, in days of old, were even accused of devouring human flesh! These persons certainly made spirituous liquors their habitual drink, and, unlike real Yogis, extorted alms and used their system as a mere pretext for making money. Reduced to a few miserable and disgusting wretches, they were finally suppressed, and have now disappeared. [One of the most profitable means of reducing the outflow of carbonic acid is the abstention from fo o d to the fullest extent consistent with the maintenance of life. Abstinence from food diminishes the number of respirations, thus diminishing the waste of carbon. We are told that: “The suppression of expiration . . . is the daily practice of the Brahman mendicants who aspire to human hibernation or Yoga.”] Human hibernation belongs to the Yoga system and may A T REATIS E O N T HE Y OGA P HILOSOPHY  457"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"be termed one of its many results, but it cannot be called “Yoga.” [The prolongation of the interval between expiration and inspiration is another important means of regula ting the outflow of carbonic acid. “The absolute quantity of carbonic acid evolved from the lungs in a given time, is less in retarded than in normal expiration.”] Thus we find, in this portion of the Treatise, a full vindication of the habits of the Hindu as c etics—nay those even of the Christian saints of every period, from the first century down to our own days, as we will prove. And hence the laugh of the ignorant, the sceptic and the materialist, at what seems to them the most absurd of practices, is turned against the jokers. For we now see that—if an ascetic prefers a subterranean cave to the open fresh air, takes (apparently) the vow of silence and meditation, refuses to touch money or anything metallic, and, lastly, passes his days in what appears the most ludicrous occupation of all that of concentrating his whole thoughts on the tip of his nose,—he does this, neither for the sake of playing an aimless comedy nor yet out of mere unreasoned superstition, but as a physical discipline, based on strictly scientific principles. Most of the thousands of fakirs, gosâîns, bairâgîs and others of the mendicant order, who throng the villages and religious fairs of India in our present age, may be and undoubtedly are worthless and idle vagabonds, modern clowns, imitating the great students of the philosophic ages of the past. And, there is but little doubt that, though they ape the postures and servilely copy the traditional customs of their nobler brethren, they understand no more why they do it than the sceptic who laughs at them. But, if we look closer at the origin of their school and study Patañjali’s Yoga-Vidya*— we will be better able to understand and hence appreciate their seemingly ridiculous practices. If the ancients were not as well versed in the details of physiology as are our physicians of the Carpenterian modern school—a question still sub judice— they may perhaps be proved, –––––––––– * [Descriptive name of Patañjali’s Sûtras . —Co m piler .] –––––––––– 458  B LAVAT SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS on the other hand, to have fathomed this science in another direction by other methods far deep e r than the former; in short, to have made themselves better acquainted with its occult and exceptional laws than we are. That the ancients of all countries were intimately acquainted with what is termed in our days “hypnotism” or self-mesmerisation, the production, in a word, of voluntary trance—cannot be denied. One of many proofs is found in the fact that the same method, described here, is known as a tradition and practiced by the Christian monks at Mount Athos even to this very day. These, to induce “divine visions,” concentrate their thoughts and fix their eyes on the navel for hours together. A number of Russian travellers testify to such an occupation in the Greek convents, and writers of other nationalities, who have visited"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"this celebrated hermitage, will bear out our assertion . . . Having made clear this first point and vindicated the Hindu Yogi’s in the name and upon the authority of modern science, we will now leave the further consideration on the subject to our next number. ———— [ The Theosophist , Vol. II, No . 1, October, 1880, pp. 4-6] [By abstention from food, water, and air, except in well defined and restricted quantities, the Yogi acquires the power of hibernation.] Dr. Tanner of New York, who has set himself to prove “that it is possible to do without a ny food—sustaining the body on water and air only for forty days and forty nights,” is said by the American papers to have been suggested through a reference to the duration of Christ’s temptation in the wilderness. But this special number of “forty days” is older than Christianity, and was practiced by more than one pre-Christian ascetic, on the strength of ancient pathology which knew the limit of man’s endurance and had well calculated the powers of the vital organs. Beyond—no man, unless he is in a complete state of hibernation, can go. Thus, is the extreme limit to the Jain fast prescribed A T REATISE ON THE Y OGA P HILOSOPHY  459 as “fort y days”; and we hope to furnish an unimpeachable proof in some future number that there are here, in Bombay, men who practice and carry out this forty days’ fast successfully. We know personally two such fanatics. A month earlier our statement would have been not only questioned but positively denied, “as the opposite of Dr. Tanner’s theory has been stoutly maintained by the orthodox American physicians.” [The normal number of respiratory movements differs in the various animals and man, and accordin g to the scale of differences, so is the longevity of the animals. The greater the number of respiratory movements per minute the shorter is the life-period. The tortoise has the least respiration, its normal rate being 3 respirations per minute. “It lives to a great age; one instance is recorded of a tortoise having lived 110 years.”] We believe this period underrated. At Colombo, Ceylon, we were shown in a garden a g igantic land turtle, about five feet long and three-and-a-half wide, which—if we have to believe the inhabitants—has lived in that place and known the Dutch in its palmy days. But this is not yet scientifically proved to us. [The tortoise is notorious for its long abstinence. It can refrain from eating and breathing for a great pa r t of the year, its usual period of hibernation being 5 months, during which it neither breathes nor eats, and is insensible to severe wounds.] When Dr. Tanner had fasted for over twelve days, some interesting experiments"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"were made by the physicians to determine whether or not his sensibility was diminished. Says the New York Tribune of July 8: The aesthesiometer was employed, an instrument consisting of two sharp points which are arrange d at right angles to a graduated scale upon which they can be moved backward and forward. This was applied to Dr. Tanner’s feet, legs, hands, and arms. He was almost invariably able to tell whether one point or two had been applied, even when they were very near together. He distinguished distances as small as three-eighths of an inch, and the opinion of the physicians was that his sensibility had not diminished. Had the physicians gone on with these experiments, they 460  B LAVA T SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS would have probably ascertained that he gradually became quite insensible to physical pain. [Ab s tinence from food induces the loss of animal heat, which in turn produces sleep and favours hibernatio n . “Fasting is a common practice among the Hindus . . . more especially at Benares, the focus of Hindu superstition.”] Simple justice compels us to remind the reader that rigid fasts do not pertain merely to “Hind u superstition.” The Roman Catholics have as many, and more than one community of monks—especially in the East—in their incessant endeavour to “subdue flesh,” adds to such fastings self-torture in the way of hair cloth, and constant flagellation. In India, Native Christians and Roman Catholic converts are made, as a penance after confession, to whip themselves in the presence of their priests till “the blood trickles in torrents,” according to the expression of an eyewitness who saw the scene but a short time ago.

This plant—its name being a secret among the Râja-Yogis—brings on without any elaborate preparation or training for the occasion as in the case of the Hatha- Yogis—a dead coma, during which all the vital functions are paralyzed and the processes of life suspended. The Yogis have learned to regulate the duration of this trance.

Thus the Râja-Yogis have been sometimes known to live the double and triple amount of years of an average human life, and occasionally, to have preserved a youthful appearance for an unusual period of time and when they were known to be old men—in years. Such at least is their explanation of the apparent phenomenon. For one who has seen such cases and assured himself that the assertion was an unimpeachable fact , and who, at the same time, utterly disbelieves in the possibility of magic, whether divine or infernal, unless the existence of its wondrous phenomena can be accounted for on the principles of exact science and shown as due to natural forces, cannot well refuse to listen to any such explanation. It may be but little plausible, and the probabilities against the advanced theory seem great. Yet—it is not one utterly impossible ; and this, till we have a better reason to reject it, than our simple ignorance of the existence of such a plant—must be considered sufficient. How often exact science is led astray by its dogmatism is once more proved in the following defeat of the orthodox “regular” physicians, as noted by the New York Tribune and in the same case of Dr. Tanner. Another account, issued on the 7th July states: Dr. Tanner claims that the crisis is past. No severe craving for food was experienced this morning. Should n o ne make itself felt the test will hereafter devolve entirely upon the ability of the vital organs to maintain their functions without food. One physician expresses the opinion that Dr. Tanner will suddenly become delirious after the twelfth or thirteenth day. Following that event he may die at any moment from lock-jaw or convulsions of the muscles. He might be resuscitated if his condition were discovered in time, but the chances would be against this owing to his excessive weakened condition. The principal change today in his condition is a decline in temperature, it being 98.25 at 6 P.M. If it falls five degrees more the result will be fatal. The doctor is still resolute and hopeful. And yet the telegram from New York given in our last number announcing that Dr. Tanner ha s gone without any food for forty days and has survived—is there! 462  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS [ Ibid .

After that period she would awake, weak but not very exhausted and ask for some milk—her habitual food. At the end of a fortnight, sometimes three weeks, she would begin to show unmistakable signs of somnolence, and at the end of a month fall into her trance again. Thus it lasted for seven years, she being considered by the populace as a great saint. It was in 1841. What became of her after that, we are unable to say. [“By Yoga I understand the act of suspending the circulation and respiration. Yoga is chiefly divided into R âja-Yoga and Hatha-Yoga .”] Here the author falls into an unmistakable error. He confounds the Raja with the Hatha- Yogi ns, whereas the former have nothing to do with the physical training of the Hatha or with any other of the innumerable sects who have now adopted the name and emblems of Yogins . Wilson in his Essays . . . on the Religion of the Hindus falls into the same confusion and knows very little, if anything at all, of the true Raja-Yogins who have no more to do with Śiva than with Vishnu or any other deity.

If, in speaking of the Dandis , we have used above the phrase beginning with the conjunction “if,” it is because we happen to know how carefully the secrets of the real Yogins— A T REATISE ON THE Y OGA P HILOSOPHY 463 n a y e v e n t h eir existence itself—are denied within this fraternity. It is comparatively but lately that the usual excuse adopted by them, in support of which they bring their strongest authorities, who affirm that the Yogi state is unattainable in the present or Kali age—has been set afloat by them. “From the unsteadiness of the senses, the prevalence of sin in the Kali , and the shortness of life, how can exaltation by the Yoga be obtained?” enquires Kaśikhanda . B ut this declaration can be refuted in two words and w ith t h eir own weapons. The duration of the present Kali-Yuga is 432,000 years of which 4,979 have already expired. It is at the very beginning of Kali-Yuga that Krishna and Arjuna were born. It is since Vishnu’s eighth incarnation that the country had all its historical Yogins, for as to the prehistoric ones, or claimed as such, we do not find ourselves entitled to force them upon public notice. Are we then to understand that none of these numerous saints, philosophers, and ascetics from Krishna down to the late Vishnu Brahmachari Bawa of Bombay had ever reached the “exaltation by Yoga”?"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"To repeat this assertion is simply suicidal in their own interests. It is not that among the Hatha- Yogins — men who at times had reached through a physical and well-organized system of training the highest powers as “wonder-workers”—there has never been a man worthy of being considered as a true Yogin. What we say, is simply this: the Raja-Yogin trains but his mental and intellectual powers, leaving the physical alone, and making but little of the exercise of phenomena simply of a physical character. Hence it is the rarest thing in the world to find a real Yogi boasting of being one, or willing to exhibit such powers—though he does acquire them as well as the one practicing Hatha Yoga , but through another and far more intellectual system . Generally, they deny these powers point blank, for reasons but too well-grounded. The latter need not even belong to any apparent order of ascetics, and are oftener known as private individuals than members of a religious fraternity, nor need they necessarily be Hindus. Kabir, who was one of them, fulminates against most of the later 464  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS sects of mendicants who occasionally become warriors when not simply brigands, and sketche s them with a masterly hand: I never beheld such a Yogi , Oh b rother! who forgetting his doctrine roves about in negligence.

When did V YASADEVA blow a trumpet? etc. Therefore, whenever the author—Dr. Paul—speaks of Raja-Yoga— the Hat h a simply is to be understood.

One of the latest is reported in the last number of the New York Medical Record (Sept., 1880), under the title of “A new and curious Plan for deadening Pain.” The experiments were made by Dr. Bonwill, a well-known physician of Philadelphia, in 1872, and have been since successfully applied as an anaesthetic. We quote it from the Dubuque Daily Telegraph . [The method is that of causing the patient to breathe rapidly—100 respirations per minute—for from two to five minutes at the end of which an “entire or partial absence of pain results for half a minute or more.” Several minor operations were made by this method, and it is claimed that it may supplant the common anaesthetics.] And if it be well proved that about 100 respirations per minute ending in rapid puffing expirations can successfully deaden pain, then why should not a varied mode of inhaling oxygen be productive of other and still more extraordinary results, yet unknown to science but awaiting her future discoveries? 466  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"[“How the Puñjabi fakir, by suspending his breath, lived 40 days without food and drink, is a question which has puzzled a great many learned men of Europe.”] But Dr. Tanner’s successful experiment of fasting 40 days that has just been complet e d, verifies the Puñjabi phenomenon which otherwise would be disbelieved altogether by scientists. [“. . . . I have treated of the various branches of Raja-Yoga by which a Yogi analyses the various corporeal, intellectual, moral, sensual, and religious principles of which man is composed. . . . I will now give a succinct account of Hatha Yoga.”] This system, evolved by long ages of practice until it was brought to bear the above-d e scribed results, was not practiced in India alone in the days of antiquity. The greatest philosophers of all countries sought to acquire these powers; and certainly, behind the external ridiculous postures of the Yogis of today, lies concealed the profound wisdom of the archaic ages; one that included among other things a perfect knowledge of what are now termed physiology and psychology. Ammonius Saccas, Porphyry, Proclus and others practiced it in Egypt; and Greece and Rome did not shrink at all even in their time of philosophical glory to follow suit. Pythagoras speaks of the celestial music of the spheres that one hears in hours of ecstasy; Zeno finds a wise man who having conquered all passions, feels happiness and emotion, but in the midst of torture; Plato advocates the man of meditation and likens his powers to those of the divinity; and we see the Christian ascetics themselves through a mere life of contemplation and self-torture acquire powers of levitation or aethrobacy, which, though attributed to the miraculous intervention of a personal God, are nevertheless real and the result of physiological changes in the human body. “The Yogi,” says Patañjali, “will hear celestial sounds, the songs and conversations of celestial choirs. He will have the perception of their touch in their passage through the air,”—which translated into a more sober language means that the ascetic is enabled to see with the spiritual eye in the Astral Light, hear with the spiritual ear subjective sounds inaudible to others, and live A T REATISE ON THE Y OGA P HILOSOPHY 467 and feel , s o to say, in the Unseen Universe . “The Yogi is able to enter a dead or a living body by the path of the senses, and in this body to act as though it were his own.” The “path of the senses”—our physical senses supposed to originate in the astral body, the ethereal counterpart of man, or the jiv-atma , which dies with the body—the senses are here meant in their spiritual sense—volition of the higher principle in man. The true Raja-Yogi is a Stoic; and Kapila, who deals but with the latter—utterly rejecting the claim of the Hatha- Yogis to converse during Samadhi with the Infinite I \u0001 war —describes their state in the following words: To a Yogi, in whose mind all things are identified as spirit, what is infatuation? What is grief?

No true Raja-Yogi will ever condescend to practice it. Besides, as every physician can easily tell, the process, if repeated, 468  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS becomes a very dangerous one for the experimenter. The following “processes” are still more hid e ous and as useless for psychological purposes.

One century, if passed, would appear no longer than one second, for all perception of time is lost for him who is subjected to it. Nor do the hairs or nails grow under such circumstances, though they do for a certain time in a body actually dead, which proves if anything can, that the atoms and tissues of the physical body are held under conditions quite different from those of the state we call death. For, to use a physiological paradox, life in a dead animal organism is even more intensely active than it ever is in a living one, which as we see, does not hold good in the case under notice. Though the average sceptic may regard this statement as sheer nonsense, those who have experienced this in themselves know it is an undoubted fact. Two certain fakirs from Nepal once agreed to try the experiment. One of them, previous to attempting the hibernation, underwent all the ceremonies of preparation as above described by Dr. Paul, and took all the necessary precautions; the other, simply threw himself by a process known to himself and others into that temporary state of complete paralysis, which imposes no limits of time, may last months as well as hours, and which is known in certain Tibet lamaseries as . . .

A moment’s reflection would have induced Professor Weber to spare himself the trouble o f asking such a question. What proportion of the English gentlemen, who take up an Indian career, care one rap about Indian history or authentic documents?

If the Professor were to poll the civil and military branches of the public service today, he would find that not one per cent even of the lusty young chaps fresh from the scholastic forcing-houses, would trouble themselves, whether or not the Sanskrit language itself, to say nothing of the Sanskrit Text Society, were extinguished tomorrow. Badminton, lawn-tennis, flirtation, racing, pig-sticking, billiards, and the bubbling peg, interest them, and there is always plenty of money to support clubs and that sort of thing. But Asiatic literature, Aryan religion or philosophy—these are not their “fad”; and, out of all these thousands upon thousands who have passed across the Indian stage, few have turned their backs upon fashionable pleasures and sought their happiness in study.

And if the “enlightened Indian princes and gentlemen” whom he mentions in the same letter to the Times , could see that their patronage of such learned bodies would secure them as much consideration with the ruling race as do their subscriptions to monuments and giving of entertainments, no doubt their aid would be generously afforded. ———— A brother Theosophist suggests one of the tersest and most satisfying definitions of the word miracle, that we have seen. “Would it not be worthwhile,” he asks, “to explain that ‘miraculous’ only means our ignorance of causes, and T HE T HEOSOPHICAL S OCIETY AT B OMBAY  475 t h a t i n d e nying miracles we only intend to deny phenomena incapable of any rational explanation whatever ; not phenomena far transcending explanation according to commonly known and admitted laws and agencies of nature?” For lack of understanding, the broad distinction we draw between the Impossible and the Unfamiliar in physics, we have often been bitterly criticised by opponents. These have even charged us with inconsistency in denying the possibility of miracles, while at the same time affirming the reality of occult phenomena of an identical character. Our quarrel is with the assumption that whatever phenomenon is strange and unfamiliar, must, ipso facto , be ascribed to supernatural agency, hence be miraculous.

But were these “Native Members” to reveal even all they knew, it would not yet in the least affect the Society as a body. The “philanthropic profession” of our Society would be as ardent as ever; and surely can never be affected by any row between two women like the present one. If you are really anxious to know the substance of the story, then you are welcome to an outline. While Colonel Olcott, Mr. Wimbridge, and myself were at Ceylon, Miss Bates quarrelled with Mdme. Coulomb and her husband, both as much members of our Society as she was herself. Moreover, Mdme. Coulomb was an old friend of mine, whom I had known ten years ago at Cairo, and who was invited by me to live in my house and take care of it during my absence. The disagreement—a tragic-comedy from the first—degenerated into a storm; and when we returned to Bombay, we found the head-quarters, like ancient Troy, in the full blaze of war. Miss Bates had contrived to"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"win over to her side several of the members, and Mdme. Coulomb had no supporters. The former wanted the Bombay Society (which is not the Theosophical Society, but simply one of its branches) to expel Monsieur and Madame Coulomb from Membership, and Colonel Olcott and myself to turn them out of the house; and we protested. Our humble opinion was that if Mdme. Coulomb was blameable, Miss Bates was not innocent. Mr. Wimbridge sided with his old friend, Miss Bates, I sided with my old friend, Mdme. Coulomb; then came the split. What took place after can more easily be imagined than described—a purely personal and domestic variance having no bearing whatever upon the question of T HE T HEOSOPHICAL S OCIETY AT B OMBAY  477 Theosoph y and of no importance to the public. But if Mr. Wimbridge and Miss Bates so desire it, and especially the friends of these “two English Members” will go on throwing the blame upon the “Founders” of the Society, then I will make these matters public from the first to the last detail— we, at least, are ready with every proof in hand to exonerate us. Our only fault was in declining to commit that which, whether rightly or wrongly, we regarded as an act of injustice. Let the “Native Members” remember, if they will, that of the Founders of the Society there are but two in India—Colonel Olcott and myself. Mr. Wimbridge enlisted himself as a simple member, three years after the Theosophical Society was founded, and but shortly before we sailed for Bombay, and he brought Miss Bates with him. Whatever my personal regard for this gentleman may have been, I am yet bound to state that he never has done anything material for the Society either as regards its progress or management beyond serving for a time upon its council. As for Miss Bates, she has been from the first a merely “ornamental,” never an active member.* You say that you “hear almost all the Native Members of the Society have given up their connection with it.” Then our Society must have hardly merited the name of one, as to my knowledge, and up to the present moment I know only of four who have done so—exclusive of the two “English Members.” But, if there are any more members in it, who realize no more than these “four,” that in such a Society as ours, individuals are as nothing, and that by entering it, they pledge themselves to serve a universal and grand idea of Brotherhood and justice, and not merely to follow one of its English members, or even its Founders in particular, and so unhappily become partisans then, the sooner they break their connection with it, the better for the Society. I have but little to add.

But the breaking of a word of honour and the violation of a pledge have ever been regarded, whether within or without a Society, as highly dishonourable. A shock has certainly been given to the Bombay Branch of the Theosophical Society by this row, but it is far more insignificant than reported, and even that is but temporary. As for the usefulness of our Society proper or even that of its humble and devoted “Founders” being impaired by the hasty action of a handful of malcontents in one city—the idea is too absurd! As well prophesy the downfall of Christianity as the result of a row in some one Methodist Chapel. The grand doctrines which the Theosophical Society represents—that of the Brotherhood of man—and its effort to resuscitate the long-buried ancient literary glories of Aryavarta, have touched the public heart, and the response is coming from the four quarters of the globe. Colonel Olcott and I are pledged to this cause, and we only ask that those who are so ready to impute to us evil motives and actions will outdo us in visible efforts to promote it.

H. P. B LAVATSKY . To the Edit o r of the Bombay Review . S IR ,— Since my a rrival here on a visit to friends, I have received an extract from the Bombay Review concerning the Theosophical Society generally and myself in particular. You say that very many of its most influential members have lately withdrawn from the Society. In reality six members only have withdrawn—they being among the least influential—from what after all is but one of the many branches of a society, the importance of which is quite independent of our efforts at Bombay. The withdrawal of these members has nothing to do with matters of opinion, nor with the aims and objects of the Society, and merely arose from private disagreements, occurring during our absence in Ceylon, between a lady guest of mine and another lady, who though she certainly came with Colonel Olcott 482  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS and myself from America in the first instance, has taken no part whatever, as matters h a v e t u r n ed out, either in forwarding our enterprise or in sharing any of its expenses. The incident is quite unimportant in itself, but misapprehensions injurious to our Cause may spring from the Press comments on the transaction. The Review says that our association thrives financially; that the initiation fees from our members must yield a considerable sum; and that The Theosophist must be “a remunerative branch of theosophy.” Permit me to explain that the initiation fees of new members in India—about 50 members only have paid—amount to Rs. 500 in the course of the last 18 months. This would, on your hypothesis, which is groundless in itself I may add, have yielded us an income of about Rs. 28 a month, on which to support the Society, ourselves, and our late friends, Mr. Wimbridge and Miss Bates. As for The"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Theosophist , the 900 paying subscribers require 900 copies of the publication, and as they only pay 8 annas a month each, the margin of profit would hardly tempt ordinary newspaper proprietors. If The Theosophist succeeds in always paying its way, I am amply satisfied. I may add that Colonel Olcott and I have spent from our own private sources for the support of the Society and its representatives, since we left America for Bombay, some Rs. 20,000, without counting considerable sums expended by Colonel Olcott during the three years previous to our leaving and since the Society’s foundation. One other point: my attention has been drawn to the fact that Colonel Olcott’s name appears as attached to the designation of a Hindu firm concerned with some trading enterprise. The easy answer is that Colonel Olcott has never derived one rupee of benefit from it. As a Commissioner from the American Department of State, charged with the promotion of trade between India and the United States, he merely hoped to advance, by permitting the use of his name, the success in America, where his name might be a recommendation, of a business of international traffic carried on here by a member of the Theosophical Society in whom he was interested. As the arrangement has been T HE P RALAYA OF M ODERN S CIENCE  483 u n d e r s t o od, Colonel Olcott will, on his return to Bombay, rectify the matter. H. P. B LAVATSKY .

Two of her votaries, Messrs. Thomson and Clausius,* have simultaneously reached the conclusive opinion that the Universe is doomed, at some future and not so very remote period, to utter destruction. Such is also the theory of several other astronomers, one and all describing the gradual cooling off and the final dissolution of our planet in terms nearly identical with those used by the greatest Hindu, and even some of the Greek sages. One might almost think he were reading over again Manu, Kanâda, Kapila and others. The following are some of the newest theories of our Western pandits . “All the ponderable masses which must have separated themselves at the evolution or first appearance upon the earth from the primeval mass of matter, will reunite themselves again into one gigantic and boundless heavenly body, every visible movement in this mass will be arrested, and alone the molecular motion will remain, which will equally –––––––––– *[Most likely James Thomson (1822-92) and Rudolf Julius Emmanuel Clausius (1822 88) .— Compiler .] –––––––––– 484  B LAVA T SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS spread throughout this ponderous body under the form of heat . . ,” say our scientists. Kanâda, t h e atomist, the old Hindu sage, said as much . . . “In creation,” he remarks, “two atoms begin to be agitated, till at length they become separated from their former union, and then unite, by which a new substance is formed, which possesses the qualities of the things from which it arose.” Lohschmidt, the Austrian professor of mathematics and astronomy, and the English astronomer, Proctor, treating of the same subject, have both arrived at another and different view of the cause from which will come the future dissolution of the world. They attribute it to the gradual and slow cooling off of the sun, which must result in the final extinction of this planet some day. All the planets will then, following the law of gravitation, tumble in upon the inanimate, cold luminary, and coalesce with it into one huge body. If this thing should happen, says the German savant , and such a period begins, then it is impossible that it should last forever, for such a state would not be one of absolute equilibrium. During a wonderful period of time, the sun, gradually"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"hardening, will go on absorbing the radiant heat from the universal space, and concentrating it around itself. But let us listen to Professor Tay upon this question. According to his opinion, the total cooling off of our planet will bring with it unavoidable death. Animal and vegetable life, which will have, previous to that event, shifted its quarters from the northern and already frozen regions to the equator, will then finally and forever disappear from the surface of the globe, without leaving behind any trace of its existence. The earth will be wrapped in dense cold and darkness; the now ceaseless atmospheric motion will have changed into complete rest and silence; the last clouds will have poured upon the earth their last rain; the course of the streams and rivers, bereaved of their vivifier and motor—the sun—will be arrested; and the seas frozen into a mass. Our globe will have no other light than the occasional glimmering of the shooting stars, which will not yet have ceased to penetrate into and become inflamed in our atmosphere. Perhaps, too, the sun, under the influence of the cataclysm T HE P RALAYA OF M ODERN S CIENCE 485 o f t h e s o l ar mass, will yet exhibit for a time some signs of vitality; and thus heat and light will re-enter it for a short space of time, but the reaction will not fail to re-assert itself; the sun, powerless and dying, will again become extinct and this time forever. Such a change was remarked and actually took place in the now extinct constellations of the Swan, the Crown, and the Ophiuchus in the first period of their cooling. And the same fate will reach all the other planets, which, meanwhile, obeying the law of inertia, will go on revolving around the extinct sun . . . Further on, the learned astronomer depicts the last year of the expiring globe in the very words of a Hindu philosopher depicting the Pralaya:—“Cold and death blow from the northern pole, and spread along the entire face of the earth, nine-tenths of which have already expired. Life, hardly perceptible, is all concentrated at her heart—the equator, in the few remaining regions which are yet inhabited, and where reigns a complete confusion of tongues and nationalities. The surviving representatives of the human race are soon joined by the largest specimen of animals which are also driven there by the intense cold. One object, one aspiration huddles together all this varied mass of beings—the struggle for life. Groups of animals, without distinction of kind, crowd together into one herd in the hope of finding some heat in the rapidly freezing bodies; snakes threaten no more with their poisonous fangs, nor lions and tigers with their sharp claws; all that each of them begs for is—life, nothing but life, life to the last minute! At last comes that last day, and the pale and expiring rays of the sun illuminate the following gloomy scene; the frozen bodies of the last of the human family, dead from cold and lack of air, on the shores of a likewise rapidly freezing, motionless sea”! . . .* The words may not be precisely those of the learned professor, for they are utilized from notes taken in a foreign language; but the ideas are literally his.

We wish them joy of their mare’s nest. The expression was this: “We even met [in Ceylon] those who had quite recently encountered such holy men [that is, men who had acquired ‘the exalted psychical powers of adeptship’]; and a certain eminent priest who joined our Society, was shortly after permitted to see and exchange some of our signs of recognition with one.” We expressly explained in the article in question that by the term Rahat we meant an adept, or one who “has developed his psychical powers to their fullest extent.” Such a person is known in India as a Rishi or a Yogi , and there are many stages and degrees of development before the pinnacle of spiritual perfectibility is reached. Thus a Rahat may be of a lower or higher degree of development. The four degrees or stages are Sukkha-vipassaka (lowest), Tevijja ( third ), Shad Abhiñña ( second ), and Siwupilidimbiapat (first) the highest. We affirmed and repeat that neither in India, Egypt, nor Ceylon, has this ancient wisdom died out, and if we believe that there still survive its adepts and initiates, it is because we speak from personal knowledge and not by hearsay. A Ceylon Christian journal charges us with childish credulity in believing in the so-called eminent priest, and giving publicity to an imposition and a myth.” The less our adversary says about impositions and myths the better: his house is of glass, and he had better not throw stones in our garden.

If the priest did see him, he saw a living man, not a ghost, or a god, or a spirit. A few weeks after landing in India, and when none but half a dozen of Bombay gentlemen knew our Society signals, Colonel Olcott, being at the Karli Caves, in the Mofussil, was accosted by a Hindu sannyâsi , who first gave him the most important of our signs and then all the rest.

Therefore and precisely because I am an “elderly lady from Russia via America,” that the latter country of unlimited freedom especially in newspaper personal abuse—has toughened me to the extent of being indifferent as to the sneering and jeering of newspapers upon questions they do not understand at all; provided they are witty and remain in the limits of propriety and do no harm but to myself. Being neither a professional medium nor a professional anything, and making my experiments in “Occult phenomena” but in the presence of a few friends—rarely before anyone who is not a member of our Society—I have a right to claim from the public a little more fairness and politeness than are usually accorded to paid jugglers and even alleged Thaumaturgists. And if my friends will insist upon publishing about “Occult phenomena” taking place in their presence, they should at least preface their narratives with the following warning: Pukka Theosophy believes in no miracle , whether divine or devilish; recognizes nothing as supernatural; believes only in facts and Science; studies the laws of Nature, both Occult and patent; and gives attention particularly to the former, just because exact Science will have nothing to do with them. Such laws are those of Magnetism in all its branches. Mesmerism, Psychology, etc. More than once in the history of its past has Science been made the victim of its own delusions as to its professed infallibility; and the time must come when the perfection of Asiatic Psychology and its knowledge of the O CCULT P HENOMENA  491 forces o f the invisible world will be recognized, as were the circulation of the blood, electricity, and so forth, after the first sneers and lampoons died away. The “silly attempts to hoodwink individuals” will then be viewed as honest attempts at proving to this generation of Spiritualists and believers in past “miracle-mongers,” that there is naught miraculous in this world of Matter and Spirit, of visible results and invisible causes; naught—but the great wickedness of a world of Christians and Pagans, alike ridiculously superstitious in one direction, that of their respective religions, and malicious whenever a purely disinterested and philanthropic effort is made to open their eyes to the truth. I beg leave to further remark that personally I never bragged of anything I might have done, nor do I offer any explanation of the phenomena, except to utterly disclaim the possession of any miraculous or supernatural powers, or the performing of anything by jugglery— i . e ., with the usual help of confederates and machinery. That’s all. And surely, if there is anything like a sense of justice left in society, I am amenable to neither statutory nor social laws for gratifying the interest of members of our Society, and the wishes of my personal friends, by exhibiting to them in privacy various phenomena, in which I believe far more firmly than any of them, since I know the laws by which they are produced, and am ready to stand any amount of personal newspaper abuse whenever these results are told to the public. The “official"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"circles at Simla” was an incorrect and foolish phrase to use. I never produced anything in the “official circles”; but I certainly hope to have impressed a few persons belonging to such “official circles” with the sense that I was neither an impostor nor “a hoodwinker of official personages,” for whom, moreover, so long as I live up to the law of the country, and respect it (especially considering my natural democratic feelings, strengthened by my American naturalization), I am not bound to have any more respect than each of them personally deserves in his individual capacity. I must add, for the personal gratification of the Editor of your contemporary, and in the hope that this will soothe his irate feelings, that of the five eye-witnesses 492  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS to the “cup” production, three (two of these of the “official circle”) utterly disbelieve the genu i neness of the phenomenon, though I would be pleased to know how, with all their scepticism, they would be able to account for it. I do not imitate the indiscretion of the Editor and mention names, but leave the public to draw such inferences as they please. I am a private individual, and no one has a right to call upon me to rise and explain. Therefore, by causing Colonel Olcott’s stolen letter to be followed by a paragraph entitled “The way they treat ‘occult phenomena’ in England,” giving an account of the arrest of Miss Houghton, a medium who obtained money under false pretenses, the Editor, by the implied innuendo which likens my case to hers, became guilty of one more unprovoked and ungentlemanly insult towards me, who obtains neither money nor favours of any sort for my “phenomena,” and lays himself open to very hard reprisals. The only benefit I have ever derived from my experiments, when made public, is newspaper abuse and more or less unfavourable comments upon my unfortunate self all over the country. This, unless my convictions were strong indeed, would amount to obtaining Billingsgate and martyrdom under false pretenses , and begging a reputation for insanity.

Vous nous dites que, ce qui vous a forcé à décliner l’honneur de vous joindre à nous—avec plusieurs autres personnes de votre savante société,—c’est « I’ esoterisme erige en principe » dans nos statuts? Permettez-moi de vous faire remarquer que vous faites erreur. Il est vrai qu’il existe dans notre société une section tout à fait ésotérique . Mais ce n’est qu’une section, très minime portion de la société qui serait peut-être mieux définie si je la nommais de suite—non seulement le tronc de l’arbre théosophique, ou sa semence—car c’est à cette section que toute notre société doit son origine,—mais la sève vivifiante qui le fait vivre et fleurir. Sans cette section, composée uniquement des adeptes de l’Orient, la Société Théosophique, dont les ramifications commencent à couvrir les cinq parties du globe, ne serait qu’un corps mort et improductif, un corps sans âme. Et cependant, les théosophes qui s’y sont fait admettre jusqu’ici, pourraient être comptés sur les doigts de la main. N’y est pas admis qui veut. Quant au reste des 494  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS théosophes, à l’exception des mots de passe et des mots d’ordre que l’on change à chaque e x pulsion d’un mauvais et faux frère—ils n’ont aucun secret à garder,—rien à cacher. Voici ce que les statuts disent à ce sujet. « XI.—La Société compte trois sections. La première est composée exclusivement des initiés aux sciences occultes ou philosophie ésotérique. Prenant un intérêt profond dans les affaires de l’administration de notre société, ils sont constamment en rapport avec le président-fondateur, mais—restent toujours inconnus à la masse des membres."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Ce n’est que ceux qu’ils choisissent eux-mêmes* qui reçoivent le droit de les connaître et de communiquer avec eux. « ( g ) Mais aucun des ces membres (ainsi favorisés) n ’ aura le droit de divulguer les secrets en sciences occultes qui pourraient lui être communiqués . Et avant qu’il soit mis en rapports directs ou indirects, avec les adeptes de la première section, il devra prêter le serment le plus solennel de ne jamais révéler ce qu’il aura su ou vu; ou user de ses connaissances pour des motifs personnels et egoïstes, ou même y faire allusion, a moins qu’il ne reçoive permission à cet effet, de son maître lui-même » . Tout le reste est fait au grand jour. Certes, il est vrai que nos membres ont des privilèges autres que ceux qui n’appartiennent pas à notre société. Chaque branche de la société (et il y en a cinquante-trois) a sa bibliothèque contennant des livres plus ou moins rares, des manuscrits inédits, auxquels le public n’a pas accès. Ils ont des meetings chaque semaine et ne publient pas leurs affaires en les proclamant sur les toits.

Vous pouvez juger comme nos « Frères » de la première section sont faciles à connaître ou à approcher! –––––––––– Q U’EST - CE QUE LA T HÉOSOPHIE ?  495 expérie n ces sont faites. Si nous n’admettons pas des visiteurs a nos assemblées hebdomadaires, ce n’est pas que nous ayons quelque chose à cacher, mais simplement pour ne pas être déranges dans nos travaux, et puis, pour éviter les sots propos et les commentaires prématurés des sceptiques. Chaque fois qu’après avoir expérimenté, nous faisons une découverte dans les forces occultes, et que nous réussissons, le fait est publié et plus d’une fois vous pourrez lire, dans le Theosophist , le récit de tel ou tel phénomène que nous pouvons reproduire à volonté, que ce soit dans les sciences physiques, physiologiques ou psychologiques. A part cette branche toute speciale d’etudes esoteriques, notre societe, comme son nom l’indique, n’est autre chose que la « Fraternite universelle; the Brotherhood of Humanity » . Notre Société accomplit ce que les sociétés des Francs-Maçons promettent, mais ne tiennent jamais. Tous les Frères , sans distinction de position sociale , race ou couleur , se donnent la main. Un lord hautain, riche et de grande naissance et qui, s’il n’était théosophe, ne laisserait souvent pas un pauvre hindou ou chinois passer le seuil de son antichambre, traite son pauvre et plus humble frère comme son égal."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Jour et nuit, nous travaillons en commun, à la régénération spirituelle des individus moralement aveugles, comme à l’élévation des nations tombées. Voici un programme auquel vous ne croirez qu’avec peine, peut être, un programme, que vous serez enclin de considérer comme purement utopique , et cependant les preuves sont là. Lisez le Theosophist et les comptes-rendus de la Société, et vous y trouverez maintes lettres écrites par des Hindous, des Ceylanais (ou Singalais), des Mahométans, pour nous remercier de nos efforts et nous donner des nouvelles des résultats obtenus. Un jeune Anglais, un juge qui est en ce moment aux provinces centrales, M. Scott, Esq., nous confesse que depuis qu’il est devenu membre de notre Société, il écoute les plaintes des indigènes avec bien plus d’attention qu’il ne l’a fait jusqu’alors. Il ne pense plus comme il le faisait depuis des années, que, dans chaque 496  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS procès ou querelle entre un Européen et un Hindou, c ’ e s t t o u j o urs l ’ Hindou qui doit avoir tort , il est enchanté de trouver tant d’éducation et d’intelligence parmi les indigènes. Il les considère comme des hommes maintenant, comme des « Frères » , tandis qu’avant, ils n’étaient à ses yeux que des chiens ou des nègres . La femme d’un général, Mrs. Murray, qui vit aux Indes depuis dix-huit ans, après son initiation, s’est mis à causer amicalement avec des Brâhmanes instruits de notre Société, et leur serra la main en partant. « C’était la première fois de sa vie, disait-elle—qu’elle touchait à des Hindous, ou échangeait quelques paroles avec eux » !!! Elle n’avait jamais parlé à un homme de cette race pendant les dix-huit années qu’elle avait passées dans ce milieu; elle était enchantée de trouver tant de personnes bien élevées parmi ces gens! Voilà les fruits de la Théosophie comme « Fraternité universelle » . Nous comptons parmi nous des Anglais en nombre considérable; tous sont des employés du gouvernement. Pensez-vous, monsieur. que dans une dizaine d’années, les résultats de nos principes théosophiques n’auront pas fait du bien à ce peuple, jusqu’ici si injustement méprisé, opprimé et méconnu? Croyez-moi, la Société théosophique est une harpe à plus d’une corde; et pas une de ces cordes qui n’ait fini par vibrer sympathiquement, en réponse à nos efforts incessants. Nous avons de la place pour tout le monde, et pour chaque aspiration. Tout dépend de ce que l’on veut faire. Êtes-vous chrétien, bouddhiste, brâhmaniste, juif ou zoroastrien? Vous n’avez qu’à vous faire affilier à la branche composée des sectateurs de la religion que vous professez. Etes-vous spiritualiste? Joignez-vous à la branche des spiritualistes. Librepenseur? Devenez un membre de la Société théosophique de Lanka, etc. N’êtes-vous de tout cela, mais seulement un penseur, un travailleur à la recherche de la vérité, et rien que la vérité; un historien, un ethnologue, un savant dévoué aux sciences physiques, un archéologue, un philologue, un antiquaire?

Là, où une « Royal Society » vous mettrait à la porte, ou voudrait vous faire passer pour un fou ou un charlatan (comme dans le cas de M. Crookes), vous trouverez une dizaine d’autres collègues et de vrais savants, qui vous soutiendront et vous aideront, parce qu’ils sont membres de la Société Théosophique comme vous, qu’ils ont juré de s’aider mutuellement et de s’enseigner les uns les autres. (Voyez votre Religion laïque ; ne s’est-elle pas éteinte sous la conspiration du silence?) Pour en finir, notre Société est tout l’opposé de toutes les autres sociétés qui existent. Nous n’y permettons pas l’ombre de dogmatisme, soit en religion, soit en science. Chacun dans sa branche à lui,—fait et agit comme bon lui semble, mais nul ne s’avise d’imposer ses idées aux autres dans nos réunions générales. Un membre qui dirait à sons « Frère » d’une autre religion: « Crois comme je le fais, ou tu es damné » ou qui tâcherait de lui faire croire que lui seul possède la vérité, ou qui insulterait à ses croyances, serait immédiatement exclu de la Société. La Société centrale protège toute croyance, toute opinion privée, comme elle protégerait la bourse de l’un de ses membres. Nul n’a droit de toucher à la relique ou à la propriété d’un de ses Frères, autrement qu’avec respect et avec l’autorisation de ce dernier. Violà pourquoi notre Société travaille en harmonie, et que, dernièrement encore, une délégation composée de neuf membres, dont deux bouddhistes, deux libres-penseurs, un chrétien, deux adorateurs du soleil (des Parsis), et deux brâhmanistes, ont été envoyés en mission à Ceylan pour defendre les droits des bouddhistes (jadis leurs ennemis acharnés et qui se haissaient mutuellement), pour fonder des Sociétés théosophiques bouddhistes, et faire des conférences et des discours en faveur de la religion de ces derniers. Je vous envoie le Theosophist , des son premier numéro, et nous vous l’enverrons régulièrement, en priant vous et votre 498  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS société de l’accepter avec nos sincères et fraternels compliments.

Pourquoi nous embarrasser des opinions personnelles de nos membres en matière de religion! Pourvu qu’une personne soit en sympathie avec nous, en général, sur les points principaux des statuts de notre Fraternité , qu’elle soit honnête, pure, sincère et prête à aider son prochain, que nous importe que cette personne le fasse au nom du Christ ou de Bouddha ! Vous n’avez qu’à relire les belles paroles de Spinoza, que vous citez dans la Religion laïque , pour comprendre cette tolérance mutuelle, cette indifférence aux noms et objets secondaires: « Il n’est pas du tout nécessaire de connaître Christ . . .

La Société Théosophique, donc, ne doit pas son nom au mot grec Theosophia , composée des deux mots « Dieu » et « sagesse » pris comme lettre morte, mais bien plutôt au sens spirituel de ce terme. C’est la Société à la recherche de la Divine sagesse , de la sagesse occulte ou spirituelle qui, tout en ne se prêtant guère, ni au creuset de la science toute physique, ni à l’investigation du matérialiste, gît cependant au fond de toute chose matérielle, car elle est l’ omega ou dernier mot de la création, ou, de –––––––––– “Veuillez voir les numéros 9, 10, et 11 du Theoso p hist .

Littré. Mais cette Divine sagesse ne se trouve-t-elle pas aussi dans l’ harmonie des sphères, comme dans l’harmonie entre les races et les hommes? Comme membres de la grande Fraternité Universelle , la fraternité des sciences, religions et idées, nous n ’ avons rien à cacher; nous faisons tout au grand jour, car, l’harmonie ne peut jamais devenir nuisible, et on ne pourrait trop en abuser. Les quelques favorisés d’entre nous, qui ont, ou pourraient franchir le seuil des sciences occultes (cette épée à double tranchant, qui sauve , mais qui tue aussi), n’ont pas le droit de les prostituer au grand jour, ces vérités, ni de trahir le grand secret.

[ La Revue Spirite , Paris, N ovember, 1880] [ Translation of the foregoing original French text .] T O M ONSIEUR C HARLES F AUVETY , P RESIDENT OF THE S OCIETY FOR P SYCHOLOGICAL S TUDIES , P ARIS . B OMBAY , August 5, 1880. V ERY HONORED S IR AND P RESIDENT , Your est e emed letter of June 25 is so serious and important that after mature deliberation, the Supreme Council of the Theosophical Society has directed me to answer you equally seriously, and upon all the points. You tell us that the reason compelling you to decline the honor of joining us—with several other persons of your learned society—is “ Esotericism set up as a principle” in our statutes? Allow me to say that you are making a mistake. It is true that a wholly esoteric section exists in our Society; but it is only a section, a very tiny part of the society which would perhaps be best defined if I call it at the W HAT IS T HEOSOPHY ?  501 outset— n ot only the trunk of the Theosophical tree or its seed—because it is to that section that our whole Society owes its origin—but the vivifying sap that makes it live and flourish. Without this section, composed solely of Oriental adepts, the Theosophical Society, whose ramifications are beginning to cover the five regions of the globe, would be nothing but a dead and sterile body, a corpse without a soul. And yet the Theosophists who have been admitted therein up to this time could be reckoned on the fingers of one hand. Admission is not by asking. As for the rest of the Theosophists, with the exception of the passwords and signs that are changed at every expulsion of a bad and false brother—there are no secrets to preserve and nothing to conceal. The following is what the Rules say on this subject:— “XI. The Society includes three sections. The first is exclusively composed of initiates in occult sciences or esoteric philosophy. Taking a profound interest in the business of the administration of our society, they are constantly in touch with the President-Founder, but—they remain unknown to the mass of the members. It is only those they themselves choose who receive the right to know them and to communicate with them.* ( g ) But none of these members (thus favored) shall have the right to divulge the"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"secrets of Occult Science which may be communicated to them . And before one can be put in touch, direct or indirect, with the adepts of the first section, he must take a most solemn pledge never to reveal what he shall learn or see; or employ his knowledge for personal and selfish motives, or even to refer to it, unless he receives permission to that effect from his Master himself.” All the rest is open to the day. But it is indeed true that our members have more privileges than persons who do not belong to our society. Every Branch of the society (and –––––––––– * Up to the present there are only five membe r s or Fellows of the Third Section who have seen them or spoken with any of them; and no more than two who have received advice and some instruction in occult sciences; and we are 45,000! You may judge how easy it is to know or approach our “Brothers” of the First Section! –––––––––– 502  B LAVA T SKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS there are fifty-three) has its library containing books more or less rare, unpublished manuscr i pts, to which the public has no access. They hold weekly meetings and do not publish their business by shouting it from the house tops. But in this they do not show any greater feeling of exclusiveness or mystery than any other scientific society—in which scientific discussions are held or experiments made. If we do not admit visitors to our weekly assemblies, it is not because we have anything to hide, but simply in order not to be disturbed in our labors, and also to avoid the foolish talk and the premature comments of the sceptics. Every time we have made an experiment and have succeeded in making a discovery in the occult forces, the fact is published, and more than once you will have read, in The Theosophist , the account of such or another phenomenon that we can reproduce at will, whether in physical, physiological, or psychological science. Aside from that special branch of esoteric studies, our society, as its name indicates, is nothing but the “Universal Brotherhood; the Brotherhood of Humanity !” Our Society accomplishes what the Masonic societies promise, but never perform. All Brothers , without distinction of social position , race , or color , offer the hand of friendship to one another. The nobly born, proud, and wealthy Lord who, if he were not a Theosophist, would hardly permit a poor Hindu or Chinese to pass the threshold of his antechamber, treats his poor and more humble brother as his equal. Day and night, we work in common for the spiritual regeneration of morally blind individuals, as well as for the elevation of the fallen nations. This is a program which you will perhaps hardly believe without reluctance, and will be inclined to consider purely Utopian, yet the proofs are there. Read The Theosophist and the Reports of the Society and you will find many a letter written by Hindûs, Ceylonese (or Singhalese), and Mohammedans to thank us for our efforts and to give us news of results obtained. A young Englishman, a magistrate, who is at"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"present in the Central Provinces, R. Scott, Esq., W HAT IS T HEOSOPHY ?  503 admits t o us that since he became a member of our Society, he listens to the pleadings of the natives with much more attention than he had done till then. He no longer thinks, as formerly for some years, that, in every case or dispute between a European and a Hindû it is always the Hindû who must be wrong; he is delighted to find so much education and intelligence among the natives. He regards them now as men, as “Brothers,” while before they were merely dogs or niggers in his eyes. The wife of a general, Mrs. Murray, who has lived in India for eighteen years, after her initiation, began to converse amiably with some educated Brâhmanas of our Society and shook hands on leaving. “It was the first time in her life,” she said, “that she had touched any Hindûs or exchanged a word with them”!!! She had never spoken to a man of that race during the eighteen years she had passed in those surroundings; she was delighted to find so many highly cultured persons among these people! That is one of the fruits of Theosophy as “Universal Brotherhood.” We include many English people among us, all of them employed by the Government. Do you think, Monsieur, that in a dozen years the effects of our Theosophical principles will not have brought some good to this people, hitherto so unjustly despised, suppressed, and ignored? Believe me, the Theosophical Society is a harp with more than one string; and there is not one of them that will not finish by vibrating sympathetically in response to our constant efforts. We have a place for everyone and for every aspiration. All depends on what you want to do. Are you Christian, Buddhist Brahman, Jew, or Zoroastrian? You have only to affiliate with the Branch composed of the followers of the religion you profess. Are you a Spiritualist? Join the Spiritualistic branch. Freethinker? Become a member of the Lankâ Theosophical Society, etc. Are you none of these, but only a thinker, a laborer in search of Truth, and nothing but the Truth; a historian, an ethnologist, a savant devoted to the physical sciences, an archaeologist, a philologist, an antiquary? You will find among us most learned, most illustrious names. You will not work alone or isolated any longer. 504  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS If a member of an Academy, of one of the Royal Societies recognized as “learned,” you will have no further need to tremble in bringing to it any of your discoveries in the ridiculed sciences which are regarded as emanating from dreams and impossible hallucinations, because you will no longer need to appeal to it in order to prove that discovery. Where one “Royal Society” would show you the door, or make you look"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"like a fool or a charlatan (as in the Crookes’ case), you would find a dozen colleagues and true scientists who would support and help you, because they are members of the Theosophical Society like yourself, and have sworn to mutually help and teach one another. (Compare your Religion laïque ; is it not extinguished under the conspiracy of silence?) To conclude this subject, our Society is entirely the opposite of every other society that exists. We do not permit in it the shadow of dogmatism, whether of religion or of science. Each in his own particular branch does and acts as it seems good to him, but no one thinks of imposing his ideas on others in our general meetings. A member who would say to his “Brother,” of another religion: “Believe as I do or you will be damned,” or who would try to make him believe that he alone possessed truth, or who should insult his beliefs, would be immediately expelled from the Society. The Parent Society protects every belief, every private opinion, as it would protect the purse of one of its members. No one has the right to touch the sacred or private property of one of his Brothers, except with respect and with the authorization of the latter. This is why our Society works in harmony, and why, even quite recently, a delegation of nine members of whom two are Buddhists, two Freethinkers, one Christian, two Sun-worshippers (Pârsîs), and two Brâhmanas, has been sent on a mission to Ceylon to defend the rights of the Buddhists (hitherto their implacable bitter enemies, mutually hating one another) to establish Buddhist Theosophical Societies, and to hold meetings and give addresses in favor of the religion of the latter. I am sending you The Theosophist , from its first issues, and we will send it to you regularly, requesting you and W HAT IS T HEOSOPHY ?  505 your soc i ety to accept it with our sincere and fraternal compliments. Read, I beg you, in the August number* an article or two which I have marked. You will see therein what the Ceylon Examiner , a Christian paper, says of our Society, of its plans, and of the practical good it has done in the world. We are all human and can easily make mistakes, and we have our opinions and our preferences as well as our tastes and different ways of seeing things. Let us then help each other mutually with the light we may have, and never dogmatize about anything, at least until a hypothesis has become an undeniable fact to the whole universe—such as the existence of the sun or the oceans. Why should we worry about the personal opinions of our members on the question of religion? Provided that a person is in sympathy with us, in general, on the principal points of the rules of our Brotherhood , that he is honest, pure, sincere, and ready to help his neighbor, what is it to us whether that person does it in the name of Christ or of Buddha ! You have merely to re-read the fine saying of Spinoza that you quote in Religion laïque to understand that mutual tolerance, that indifference to secondary names and objects: “It is not at all necessary to know Christ . . . [we will add—nor Buddha, nor Zoroaster, nor Parabrahman] according to the flesh, but rather"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"the ideal Christ, that is to say the eternal son of God, that Divine Wisdom which manifests itself in everything . . . because it is that alone which can carry us to the perfect state, by teaching us what is true and false, good or bad.” The Theosophical Society, then, does not derive its name from the Greek word Theosophia , composed of the two words “God” and “wisdom” taken in the dead letter, but rather in the spiritual sense of the term. It is the Society for searching into Divine Wisdom , occult or spiritual wisdom which, while hardly yielding itself either to the crucible of an entirely physical science, or to the investigation of the materialist, lies, however, at the foundation of everything, material or immaterial, because it is the –––––––––– *Please see numbers 9, 10, and 11 of The The o sophist .

This Divine Wisdom has been discovered by Mr. Edison, the Theosophist, in the eternity of sound, which never disappears, not even when its organ, the sheet of lead, disappears; and Robert Fludd, the great Rosicrucian, intercepted and interrogated it in the flame, in the fire, of which neither the essence nor the origin are yet known to official science, and which will never be known, at least unless it condescends to walk in the way traced by the Fire-Philosophers of the Middle Ages, those “dreamers” and those “idiots,” according to Mr. Littré. But is not that Divine Wisdom also found in the harmony of the spheres as well as in the harmony of races and men? As members of the great Universal Fraternity , the fraternity of sciences, religions, and ideas, we have nothing to hide : we do everything in the open, because harmony can never become harmful, and it cannot be abused. The few favored persons among us who have or could have crossed the threshold of the occult sciences (that double-edged sword which saves , but also kills ), have no right to expose these truths in open day nor to betray the great secret. That secret is not for us, Monsieur, it does not belong to our century; it is the heritage of the martyrs, of the philosophers and the saints of the great Past . If for one reason or another, the custodians of those secrets, who alone possess them, find it right that they should be well protected and never exposed to the risk of falling into the hands of the profane, the people who indulge themselves in discord and who despise every idea of harmony between the so-called “superior” races and those they treat as “inferior,” to us belongs the choice of rejecting their conditions, or accepting them and defending those secrets “with our life.” You see clearly, then, that Esotericism is “erected as a principle” among us only for the purpose of gaining admission as neophytes in the Branch of the Yogins, the Sannyâsins."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"As I have had the honor of informing you, that Branch only reckons five members.

A pamphlet edition of “A Speech delivered in the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford, on Monday, May 10, 1880, by Sir Richard Temple, Bart., G.C.S.I., C.I.E., late Governor of Bombay, in furtherance of the Oxford Mission to Calcutta,” just sent us from England, informs the Oxonians that “modern education is shaking the Hindu faith to its very foundation”; and “among the consequences of such a change in the minds of the people is the formation of several important sects.” He, however, bethought him of only three—the Brahmo Samaj, the Prârthana Samaj, and—the sect of Theosophists! “There is another sect,” says Sir Richard, “called the Prârthana Samaj, which is now being established in Poona ; and in the city of Bombay itself, there is another sect , called the Theosophists.” The religious opinions of two of these three important sects are kindly 508  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS explained. The Brahmos “are almost, though not entirely, Christians. You may attend o n e o f t h e ir lectures, and you will hear the speaker begin with a text from the New Testament, and he will proceed for many minutes before you will find out that he is not a Christian.

But he knows all about us at any rate: possibly from the reports of his secret police. “The Theosophists of Bombay are, I believe,” remarks the eminent lecturer, “being instructed by persons, not natives, but of European descent, who have, after abandoning Christianity, proceeded to India to discover in the Vedas, the ancient writings of that country, the true source of wisdom.” And he most kindly suggests that the one thing which “the upper educated classes of the people of India” need is “to send out to them men of greater culture than their own.” Stopping only to remark that neither Oxford nor any other European university ever turned out a scholar, the equal of any one of fifty Indian philosophers who might be named, we will say that greater ignorance of the objects and principles of the Theosophical Society could not have been shown. It is not led by persons who abandoned Christianity, since they never accepted it; nor is it a religious sect, nor does it profess to be, but, on the contrary, it distinctly affirms that as a society it has no creed, and takes in members of all creeds upon equal terms. While so far from our helping or encouraging Hindus to “throw off"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"the faith of their fathers,” we have been doing our best for the past two years to make them respect that faith more than ever, and to realize that their ancestors taught a better religion, better philosophy, and better science than any other nation of Europe ever heard of. If Sir Richard means to discourse again at Oxford upon Indian religious opinion and “sects” he would do well to study his subject a little deeper. He might then even ascertain that there is a Hindu sect-leader with some three lakhs of P RANKS OF “S PIRITS ” A MONG L AYMEN  509 followe r s, named Pandit Dayânand Saraswati Swami, whose Arya Samaj has fifty branches throughout India—one at Bombay, with a member of the Governor’s Council as President—and the avowed object of which is to promote the study of the Vedas . ———— "},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME II 1880 PRANKS OF “SPIRITS” AMONG LAYMEN [ The Theosophist , Vol. I I , No. 3, December, 1880, p. 54.] [The following introductory note by H.

Such weird phenomena cannot be easily doubted, nor, if the personal experience and the testimony of millions of people from the remotest ages is worth anything, can they be as little disproved as accounted for. No; not even by the most rabid freethinkers of Bradlaugh’s school, unless they are determined to be illogical and go against the very spirit of their own teaching—“Believe but in that which your own eyes see, your own ears hear, and your own hands touch,” and whatever the agency sceptics may attribute such phenomena to.

They have either to admit with the Christians the existence of the devil, or with the Kabalists that of the “elementaries.” To speak frankly, and in all sincerity, we fail to perceive any substantial difference between a Christian devil—originally a “fallen angel”—and a bad, wicked “spirit”—or a departed soul—each of which the spiritualists hold as being of angelic divine origin. ————"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME II 1880 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES [ The Theosophist , Vol. II, N o. 3, December, 1880, pp. 47, 49, 59, 60] [ Moksha ] — The abstract condition of pure spirit, almost identical with the nirvâna of the Buddhists.

The novelist, who began by picking up his Beatrices and Lauras in the social gutter, the author of La Dame aux Camélias and La Dame aux Perles , is regarded in France as the finest known analyst of the female heart. He now comes out in a new light; as a defender of Women’s Rights in general, and of those women especially whom English people generally talk about as little as possible. If this gifted son of a still more gifted father never sank before to the miry depths of that modern French realistic school now in such vogue, the school headed by the author of l ’ Assommoir and Nana , and so fittingly nicknamed l ’ École Ordurialiste , it is because he is a born poet, and follows the paths traced out for him by the Marquis de Sade, rather than those of Zola. He is too refined to be the rival of writers like those who call themselves auteurs-naturalistes and romanciers-expérimentalistes , who use their pen as the student in surgery his scalpel, plunging it into the depths of all the social cancers they can find. Until now he idealized and beautified vice. In the work under review, he defends not only its right to exist under certain conditions, but claims for it a recognized place in the broad sunlight of social and political life. His brochure of 216 pages, which has lately been published in the shape of a letter to J. Clarétie, is now having an immense success. By the end of September, hardly a week after its appearance, it had already reached its sixth F RENCH V IEW OF W OMEN’S R IGHTS  513 edition . I t treats of two great social difficulties—the question of divorce, and the right of women to participate in elections. Dumas begins by assuming the defense of the several women who have recently played an important part in murder cases, in which their victims were their husbands and lovers. All these women, he says, are the embodiment of the idea which for some time past has been fermenting in the world. It is that of the entire disenthralment of the woman from her old condition of slavery, created for her by the Bible , and enforced by tyrannical society. All these murders and this public vice, as well as the increasing mental labour of women, Mr. Dumas takes to be so many signs of one and the same"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"aspiration—that of mastering man, getting the best of him, and competing with him in everything. What men will not give them willingly, women of a certain class endeavour to obtain by cunning. As a result of such a policy, he says, we see “those young ladies” acquiring enormous influence over men in all social affairs and even in politics. Having amassed large fortunes, when older, they appear as lady-patronesses of girls’ schools and of charitable institutions, and take a part in provincial administration. Their past is lost sight of; they succeed in establishing, so to say, an imperium in imperio , where they enforce their own laws, and manage to have them respected. This state of things is attributed by Dumas directly to the restriction of Woman’s Rights, to the state of legal slavery women have been subjected to for centuries, and especially to the marriage and anti-divorce laws. Answering the favourite objection of those who oppose divorce on the ground that its establishment would promote too much freedom in love, the author of Le Demi-Monde bravely pushes forward his last batteries and throws off the mask. Why not promote such freedom? What appears a danger to some, a dishonour and shame to others, will become an independent and recognized profession in life— une car r ière à part— a fact, a world of its own, with which all the other corporations and classes of society will have to reckon. It will not be long before everyone will have ceased to protest against its right to an independent and legal existence. Very shortly it will form itself 514  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS into an in te gral, compact body; and the time will come when, between this world and the others, relations will be established as friendly as between two equally powerful and recognized empires. With every year women free themselves more and more from empty formalism , and Mr. D u mas hopes there will never again be a reaction. If a woman is unable to give up the idea of love altogether, let her prefer unions binding neither party to anything, and let her be guided in this only by her own free will and honesty . Of course it is rather to review an important current of feeling in an important community than to discuss au fond the delicate questions with which Mr. Dumas deals, that we are taking notice of his book. We may thus leave the reader to his own reflections on this proposed reform, as also in reference to most of the points raised. A certain Hubertine Auclaire, in France, has lately refused to pay her taxes on the plea that political rights belonging to man are denied to her as a woman; and Dumas, with this incident as a text, devotes the last part of this brochure to a defense of Woman’s Rights, as eloquent, impressive, and original as other portions which will less bear discussion. He writes: In 1847 political reformers thought it necessary to lower the electoral franchise and distribute the right of v ote according to capacity. That is, to limit it to intelligent men. The government refused, and this led to the Revolut i on of 1848. Scared, it gave the people the right of universal suffrage, extending the right to all, whether capable or incapable, provided the voters were only men. At present this right holds good, and nothing can abolish it. But women come, in"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"their turn, and ask: “How about us? We claim the same privileges.” What [asks Dumas] can be more natural, reasonable and just? There is no reason why woman should no t have equal rights with man. What difference do you find between the two which warrants your refusing her such a privilege? None at all. Sex? Her sex has no more to do with it than the sex of man. As to all other dissimilarities between us, they go far more to her credit than to ours. If one argues that woman is by nature a weaker creature than man, and that it is his duty to take care of and defend her, we will answer that hitherto we A F RENCH V IEW OF W OMEN’S R IGHTS  515 have, it seems, so badly defended her that she had to pick up a revolver and take that defense into her own han d s; and to remain consequent [consistent] with ourselves we have to enter the verdict of “Not guilty” whenever she is caught in that act of self-defense. To the plea that woman is intellectually weaker than man, and is shown to be so by sacred w r itings, the author sets off against the biblical Adam and Eve, Jacolliot’s translation of the Hindu legend in his Bible dans l ’ lnde , and contends that it was man, not woman, who became the first sinner and was turned out of Paradise. If man is endowed with stronger muscles, woman’s nerves surpass his in capacity for endurance. The biggest brain ever found—in weight and size—is now proved to have belonged to a woman. It weighed 2,200 grammes—400 more than that of Cuvier. But brain has nothing to do with the electoral question. To drop a ballot into the urn no one is required to have invented powder, or to be able to lift 500 kilogrammes. Dumas has an answer for every objection. Are illustrious women exceptions? He cites a brilliant array of great female names, and contends that the sex in which such exceptions are to be met has acquired a legal right to take part in the nomination of the village maires and municipal officers. The sex which claims a Blanche de Castile, an Elizabeth of England. another of Hungary, a Catherine II and a Maria Theresa has won every right. If so many women were found good enough to reign and govern nations, they surely must have been fit to vote. To the remark that women can neither go to war nor defend their country, the reader is reminded of such names as Joan of Arc, and the three other Joans, of Flanders, of Blois, and Joan Hachette. It was in memory of the brilliant defense and salvation of her native town, Beauvais, by the latter Joan, at the head of all the women of that city, besieged by Charles le Téméraire, that Louis XI decreed that henceforth and forever the place of honour in all the national and public processions should belong to women. Had woman no other rights in France, the fact alone that she was called upon to sacrifice 1,800,000 of her sons to Napoleon the Great, ought to ensure to her every right. 516  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"The example of Hubertine Auclaire will be soon followed by every woman in France. Law was ever unjust to woman; and instead of protecting her, it seeks but to strengthen her chains. In case of crimes committed, does law ever think of bringing forward as an extenuating circumstance, her weakness? On the contrary it always takes advantage of it. The illegitimate child is given by it the right to find out who its mother was, but not its father. The husband can go anywhere, do whatever he pleases, abandon his family, change his citizenship, and even emigrate, without the consent or even knowledge of his wife. She can do nothing of the kind. In case of a suspicion of her faith, he can deprive her of her marriage portion; and in case of guilt may even kill her. It is his right. Debarred from the benefits of a divorce, she has to suffer all, and finds no redress. She is fined, judged, sentenced, imprisoned, put to death, and suffers all the penalties of the law just as much and under the same circumstances as he does, but no magistrate has ever thought of saying yet: “Poor weak little creature! . . Let us forgive her, for she is irresponsible, and so much lower than man!” The whole eloquent, if sometimes rhapsodical plea in favour of women’s suffrage is concluded with the following suggestions: First, the situation will appear absurd; but gradually people will become accustomed to the idea, a n d s o o n every protest will die out. No doubt at first the idea of woman in this new rôle will have to become the subject of bitter criticism and satire. Ladies will be accused of ordering their hats à l ’ urne , their bodices au suffrage universel , and their skirts au scrutin secret . But what then? After having served for a time as an object of amazement, then become a fashion and habit, the new system will be finally looked upon as a duty. At all events it has now become a claimed right . A few grandes dames in cities, some wealthy female land-owners in provincial districts, and leaseholders in villages, will set the example, and it will soon be followed by the rest of the female population. The book winds up with this question and answer: I may, perhaps, be asked by some pious and disciplined lady, some fervent believer in the idea that humanity c an only be rescued from perdition by codes and gospels, by the Roman law and Roman Church: A F RENCH V IEW OF W OMEN’S R IGHTS  517 “Pray, tell me, sir, where are we driving to with all these ideas?” “ Hé , madam e ! . . . w e go where we were going to from the first, to that which must be, that is, the inevitable. We move slowly onward, because we can spare time, having some millions of years yet before us, and because we have to leave some work to do for those who are following us. For the present we are occupied in enfranchising women; when this is done we will try to enfranchise God. And as soon as full harmony will have been established between these three eternal principles—God, man, and woman—our way will appear to us less dark before us, and we will journey on the quicker.” Certainly the advocates of Woman’s Rights in England have never vet approached their su b ject from this point of view. Is the new method of attack likely to prove more effective than the familiar declamation of the British platform, or the earnest prosing of our one great woman’s champion, John Stuart Mill? This remains to be seen; but certainly for the most part the English ladies who fight this battle will be puzzled how"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"to accept an ally whose sympathy is due to principles so frightfully indecorous as those of our present author.
