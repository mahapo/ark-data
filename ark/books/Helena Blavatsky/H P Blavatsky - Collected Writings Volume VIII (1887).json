B.’s writings, begins the period of her brilliant and dynamic Editorials, as well as oth e r essays and articles, in the pages of the newly-started monthly journal Lucifer. The first issue of this magazine is dated September 15, 1887, and the title-page describes it as: A Theosophical Magazine, designed to “bring to light the hidden things of darkness,” a description fully justified by the many remarkable articles which appeared in its pages as time went on. Lucifer began to be published only four months after H. P. B. had settled in London, having come over from Ostende, Belgium, at the insistent urging of Bertram and Archibald Keightley and others. For a short time, the magazine was published by George Redway, in York Street, Covent Garden, but the same Fall the Theosophical Publishing Company was organized with a capital of £1,500, and took over the publication of Lucifer and whatever else was being brought out by the indefatigable workers in London. From the very first issue, and until October, 1888, the Editorial responsibility for Lucifer was shared by H. P. B. with Mabel Collins, which was the nom de plume of Mrs. Kenningale Cook. Considering the important role that she played in the Movement, it has been thought advisable to include a rather comprehensive biographical sketch of her career in the Bio-Bibliographical Index of the present Volume, to which the student is referred.— Compiler.

W HY THE M AGAZINE IS CALLED “ L UCIFER.” [ Lucifer , Vol. I, No. 1, Septemb e r, 1887, pp. 1-7] What’s in a name? Very often there is more in it than the profane is prepared to understand, or the learned myst i c to explain. It is an invisible, secret, but very potential influence that every name carries about with it and “leaveth wherever it goeth.” Carlyle thought that “there is much, nay, almost all, in names.” “Could I unfold the influence of names, which are the most important of all clothings, I were a second great Trismegistus,” he writes. The name or title of a magazine started with a definite object, is, therefore, all important; for it is, indeed, the invisible seedgrain, which will either grow “to be an all-overshadowing tree” on the fruits of which must depend the nature of the results brought about by the said object, or the tree will wither and die. These considerations show that the name of the present magazine—rather equivocal to the orthodox Christian ears—is due to no careless selection, but arose in consequence of much thinking over its fitness, and was adopted as the best symbol to express that object and the results in view. Now, the first and most important, if not the sole object of the magazine, is expressed in the line from the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians , on its title page. It is to bring light to “the hidden things of darkness” (iv, 5); to show in their true aspect and their original real meaning things and names, men and their doings and customs; it is finally to fight prejudice, hypocrisy and shams in every nation, in every class of Society, as in every department of life. The task is a laborious one but it is neither impracticable nor useless, if even as an experiment. Thus, for an attempt of such nature, no better title could ever be found than the one chosen. “Lucifer” is 6   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS the pale morning-star, the pre c ursor of the full blaze of the noon-day sun—the “Eosphoros” of the Greeks. It shin es timidly at dawn to gather forces and dazzle the eye after sunset as its own brother “Hesperos”—the radiant evening star, or the planet Venus. No fitter symbol exists for the proposed work—that of throwing a ray of truth on everything hidden by the darkness of prejudice, by social or religious misconceptions; especially by that idiotic routine in life, which, once that a certain action, a thing, a name, has been branded by slanderous inventions, however unjust, makes respectable people, so-called, turn away shivering l y, refusing to even look at it from any other aspect than the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"one sanctioned by public opinion. Such an endeavour then, to force the weak-hearted to look truth straight in the face, is helped most efficaciously by a title belonging to the category of branded names. Piously inclined readers may argue that “Lucifer” is accepted by all the churches as one of the many names of the Devil. According to Milton’s superb fiction, Lucifer is Satan, the “rebellious” angel, the enemy of G od and man. If one analyzes his rebellion, however, it will be found of no worse nature than an assertion of free-will and independent thought, as if Lucifer had been born in the XIXth century. This epithet of “rebellious,” is a theological calumny, on par with that other slander of God by the Predestinarians, one that makes of deity an “Almighty” fiend worse than the “rebellious” Spirit himself; “an omnipotent Devil desiring to be ‘complimented’ as all-merciful when he is exerting the most fiendish cruelty,” as put by James A. Cotter Morrison. Both the foreordaining and predestining fiend-God, and his subordinate agent are of human invention; they are two of the most morally repulsive and horrible theological dogmas that the nightmares of light-hating monks have ever evolved out of their unclean fancies. They date from the Mediaeval age, the period of mental obscuration, during which most of the present prejudices and superstitions have been forcibly inoculated on the human mind, so as to have become nearly ineradicable "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME VIII W HAT’S IN A N AME?  7 in some cases, one of which is the p resent prejudice now under discussion. So deeply rooted, indeed, is this p r econception and aversion to the name of Lucifer—meaning no worse than “light-bringer” (from lux , lucis, “light,” and ferre , “to bring”) *—even among the edu c ated classes, that by adopting it for the title of their magazine the editors have the prospect of a long strife with public prejudice before them. So absurd and ridiculous is that prejudice, indeed, that no one has seemed to ever ask himself the question, how came Satan to be called a light-bringer , unless the silvery rays of the morning-star can in any way be made suggestive of the glare of the infernal flames. It is simply, as Henderson showed, “one of those gross perversions of sacred writ which so extensively obtain, and which are to be traced to a proneness to seek for more in a given passage than it really contains—a disposition to be influenced by sound rather than sense, and an implicit faith in received interpretation”—which is not quite one of the weaknesses of our present age. Nevertheless, the prejudice is there, to the shame of our century. This cannot be helped. The two editors would hold themselves as recreants in their own sight, as traitors to the very spirit of the proposed work, were they to yield and cry craven before the danger. If one would fight prejudice, and brush off the ugly cobwebs of superstition and materialism alike from the noblest ideals of our forefathers, one has to prepare for opposition. “The crown of the reformer and innovator is a crown of thorns” indeed.

One of the editors received and recorded some spicy objections. The scenes that follow are sketches from nature. I A Well-known Novelist. Tell me ab o ut your new magazine. What class do you propose to appeal to? Editor. No class in particular: we intend to appeal to the public. Novelist. I am very glad of that. For once I shall be one of the public, for I don’t understand your subject in the least, and I want to. But you must remember that if your public is to understand you, it must necessarily be a very small one. People talk about occultism nowadays as they talk about many other things, without the least idea of what it means. We are so ignorant and—so prejudiced. Editor. Exactly. That is what calls the new magazine into existence. We propose to educate you, and to tear the mask from every prejudice. Novelist. That really is good news to me, for I want to be educated. What is your magazine to be called? Editor. Lucifer. Novelist. What! Are you going to educate us in vice? We know enough about that. Fallen angels are plentiful. You may find popularity, for soiled doves are in fashion just now, while the white-winged angels are voted a bore, because they are not so amusing. But I doubt your being able to teach us much. II A Man of the World ( in a careful undertone, for the scene is a dinner-party ) . I hear you are going to start a magazine, all about occultism. Do you know, I’m very glad. I don’t say anything about such matters as a rule, but some queer things have happened in my life which can’t be explained in any ordinary manner. I hope you will go in for explanations.

Just so, I want to know all about it, for ‘pon my honour, life’s a mystery. There are plenty of other people as curious as myself. This is an age which is afflicted with the Yankee disease of “wanting to know”. I’ll get you lots of subscribers. What’s the magazine called? Editor. Lucifer—and ( warned by former experience ) don’t misunderstand the name. It is typical of the divine spirit which sacrificed itself for humanity—it was Milton’s doing that it ever became associated with the devil. We are sworn enemies of popular prejudices, and it is quite appropriate that we should attack such a prejudice as this—Lucifer, you know, is the Morning Star—the Light-bearer. . . . . . . A M. W. ( interrupting ) . Oh, I know all that—at least I don’t know, but I take it for granted you’ve got some good reason for taking such a title. But your first object is to have readers; you want the public to buy your magazine, I suppose. That’s in the programme, isn’t it? Editor. Most decidedly. A M. W. Well, listen to the advice of a man who knows his way about town. Don’t mark your magazine with the wrong colour at starting. It’s quite evident, when one stays an instant to think of its derivation and meaning, that Lucifer is an excellent word.

Don’t call it Lucifer—please don’t. Nobody knows what the word is typical of; what it means now is the devil, nothing more or less. Editor. But then that is quite a mistake, and one of the first prejudices we propose to do battle with. Lucifer is the pale, pure herald of dawn— Lady ( interrupting ). I thought you were going to do something more interesting and more important than to whitewash mythological characters. We shall all have to go to school again, or read up Dr. Smith’s Classical Dictionary. And what is the use of it when it is done? I thought you were going to tell us things about our own lives and how to make them better. I suppose Milton wrote about Lucifer, didn’t he?—but nobody reads Milton now. Do let us have a modern title with some human meaning in it. IV A Journalist ( thoughtfully, while rolling his cigarette ). Yes, it is a good idea, this magazine of yours. We shall all laugh at it, as a matter of course; and we shall cut it up in the papers. But we shall all read it, because secretly everybody hungers after the mysterious. What are you going to call it? Editor. Lucifer. Journalist ( striking a light ) . Why not The Fusée ? Quite as good a title and not so pretentious. The “Novelist,” the “Man of the World,” the “Fashionable Lady,” and the “Journalist,” should be the first to receive a l ittle instruction. A glimpse into the real and primitive character of Lucifer can do them no harm and may, perchance, cure them of a bit of ridiculous prejudice.

If there are more useful things to do in this life than “whitewash mythological characters,” to slander and blacken them is, at least, as useless, and shows, moreover, a narrow-mindedness which can do honour to no one. W HAT’S IN A N AME?   11 To object to the title of L UCIFER , only b ecause its “associations are so dreadful,” is pardonable—if it can be pardonabl e in any case—only in an ignorant American missionary of some dissenting sect, in one whose natural laziness and lack of education led him to prefer ploughing the minds of heathens, as ignorant as he is himself, to the more profitable, but rather more arduous, process of ploughing the fields of his own father’s farm. In the English clergy, however, who all receive a more or less classical education, and are, therefore, supposed to be acquainted with the ins and outs of theological sophistry and casuistry, this kind of opposition is absolutely unpardonable. It not only smacks of hypocrisy and deceit, but places them directly on a lower moral level than him they call the apostate angel. By endeavouring to show the theological Lucifer, fallen through the idea that “To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell; Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven,” they are virtually putting into practice the supposed crime they would fain accuse him of. They prefer reigning over the spirit of the masses by means of a pernicious dark LIE , productive of many an evil, than ser v e heaven by serving TRUTH . Such practices are worthy only of the Jesuits. But their sacred writ is the first to contradict their interpretations and the association of Lucifer, the Morning Star, with Satan. Chapter xxii of Revelation, verse 16th, says “I Jesus . . . . . . . am the root . . . . and the bright and morning star” ( , “early rising”): hence Eosphoros, or the Latin Lucifer. * The opprobrium attached to this name is of such a very late date, that the Roman Church found itself forced to screen the theological slander behind a two-sided interpretation—as usual.

It is not easily ascertainable as to which Yonge is meant here; most probably, however Charles Duke Yonge (1812-1891), Professor of History and English Literature in Queen’s College, Belfast, even though his voluminous writings are primarily concerned with Greek and Latin languages. As to “ecclesiastical records,” referred to by H.P.B., the best known among them, bearing on the history of the Papacy, make no mention of any Pope by that name. In this connection, the student is referred to the Liber Pontificalis, or Gesta Pontificum Romanorum, consisting of the lives of the bishops of Rome from the time of St. Peter to the death of Nicholas I in 867, to which-were appended supplements at a later date, continuing the series. The Liber, used by Bede for his Historia Ecclesiastica, was first printed at Mainz in 1602. The best edition is by the French scholar, Monsignor Louis Marie Olivier Duchesne (2 vols., Paris, 1886-1892). No Pope by the name of Lucifer occurs in the above-mentioned work, or any other available sources. It is conceivable, however, that H. P. B. may have meant Lucifer, bishop of Cagliari (hence called Caralitanus ), an ardent supporter of the cause of Athanasius, and who died in 371. He is popularly regarded in Sardinia as a saint. A number of his controversial writings are still extant.

By c h oosing it, we throw the first ray of light and truth on a ridiculous prejudice which ought to have no room made for it in this our “age of facts and discovery.” We work for true Religion and Science, in the interest of fact as against fiction and prejudice. It is our duty, as it is that of physical Science—professedly its mission—to throw light on facts in Nature hitherto surrounded by the darkness of ignorance. And since ignorance is justly regarded as the chief promoter of superstition, that work is, therefore, a noble and beneficent work. But natural Sciences are only one aspect of SCIENCE and TRUTH . Psychological and moral Sciences, or theosophy, the knowledge of divine truth, wheresoever found, are still mo r e important in human affairs, and real Science should not be limited simply to the physical aspect of life and nature. Science is an abstract of every fact, a comprehension of every truth within the scope of human research and intelligence. “Shakespeare’s deep and accurate science in mental philosophy” (Coleridge), has proved more beneficent to the true philosopher in the study of the human heart—therefore, in the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"promotion of truth—than the more accurate, but certainly less deep, science of any Fellow of the Royal Institution. Those readers, however, who do not find themselves convinced that the Church had no right to throw a slur upon a beautiful star, and that it did so through a mere necessity of accounting for one of its numerous loans from Paganism with all its poetical conceptions of the truths in Nature, are asked to read our article “The History of a Planet.” Perhaps, after its perusal, they will see how far Dupuis was justified in asserting that “all the theologies have their origin in astronomy.” With the modern Orientalists every myth is solar. This is one more prejudice, and a preconception in favour of materialism and physical science. It will be one of our duties to combat it with much of the rest.

Venus is the queen among our planets, the crown jewel of our solar system. She is the inspirer of the poet, the guardian and companion of the lonely shepherd, the lovely morning and the evening star. For, “Stars teach as well as shine,” although their secrets are still untold and unrevealed to the majority of men, including astronomers. They are “a beauty and a mystery,” verily.

She became the scapegoat, the Azaziel of the starry dome, for the sins of the Earth, or rather for those of a certain class in the human family—the clergy—who slandered the bright orb, in order to prove what their ambition suggested to them as the best means to reach power, and exercise it unswervingly over the superstitious and ignorant masses. This took place during the middle ages. And now the sin lies back at the door of Christians and their scientific inspirers, though the error was successfully raised to the lofty position of a religious dogma, as many other fictions and inventions have been. Indeed, the whole sidereal world, planets and their regents—the ancient gods of poetical paganism—the sun, the moon, the elements, and the entire host of incalculable worlds—those at least which happened to be known to the Church Fathers—shared in the same fate.

While the history of the other six planets, and their gradual transformation from Greco-Aryan gods into Semitic devils, and finally into “divine attributes of the seven eyes of the Lord,” is known but to the educated, that of Venus-Lucifer has become a household story among even the most illiterate in Roman Catholic countries. This story shall now be told for the benefit of those who may have neglected their astral mythology. Venus, characterized by Pythagoras as the sol alter, a second Sun, on account of her magnificent radiance—equalled by none other—was the first to draw the attention of ancient Theogonists. Before it began to be called Venus, it was known in pre -Hesiodic theogony as Eosphoros (or Phosphoros) and Hesperos, the children of the dawn and twilight. In Hesiod, moreover, the planet is decomposed into two divine beings, two brothers—Eosphoros (the Lucifer of the Latins) the morning, and Hesperos, the evening star. They are the children of Astraios and Eos, the starry heaven and the dawn, as also of Kephalos and Eos ( Theog ., 378-82; Hyginus, Poeticôn Astronomicôn , II, xlii).* Preller, quoted by Decharme, shows Phaëton –––––––––– * [Caius Julius Hyginus—also Hy g enus, Yginus and Iginus—was a celebrated grammarian, said by Suetonius to have been a native of Spain, and to have been brought to Rome after its capture by Caesar.

There are numerous references to his various works in Pliny, Gellius, Macrobius and others, evidencing that he was held in great respect; most of his works have perished. We have, however, two pieces in prose, nearly entire, which bear the name of Hyginus, but which, on account of their inferior language, may have been put together by someone else. These are: Fabularum liber, containing mythological legends and the genealogy of divinities; and Poeticôn Astronomicôn in four books, treating of the asterisms, the definition of astronomical terms, the constellations and the mythological legends attached to them.

Now Phaëton or Phosphoros, the “luminous morning orb,” is carried away in his early youth by Aphrodite (Venus) who makes of him the night guardian of her sanctuary ( Theog., 986-991). He is the “beautiful morning star” ( Vide St. John’s Revelation , xxii , 16) loved for its radiant light by the Goddess of the Dawn, Aurora, who, while gradually eclipsing the light of her beloved, thus seeming to carry off the star, makes it reappear on the evening horizon where it watches the gates of heaven.

(Decharme, op. cit. , p. 248.) So far, there seems to b e no possible rapprochement, no analogy to be discovered between the poetical personification of a star, a purely astronomical myth, and the Satanism of Christian theology. True, the close connection between the planet as Hesperos, the evening star, and the Greek Garden of Eden with its Dragon and the golden apples may, with a certain stretch of imagination, suggest some painful comparisons with the third chapter of Genesis. But this is insufficient to justify the building of a theological wall of defence against paganism made up of slander and misrepresentations. But of all the Greek euhemerisations, Lucifer-Eosphoros is, perhaps, the most complicated. The planet has become with the Latins, Venus, or Aphrodite- Anadyomene , the foam-born Goddess, the “Divine Mother,” and one with the Phoenician Astarte, or the Jewish Astaroth.

They were all connected with the moon and the crescent, with the Dragon and the planet Venus, as the mother of Christ has been made connected with all these attributes. If the Phoenician mariners carried, fixed on the prow of their ships, the image of the goddess Astarte (or Aphrodite, Venus Erycina) and looked upon the evening and the morning star as their guiding star, “the eye of their Goddess mother,” so do the Roman Catholic sailors the same to this day. They fix a Madonna on the prows of their vessels, and the blessed Virgin Mary is called the “ Virgin of the Sea.” The accepted patroness of Christian sailors, their star, “ Stella Del Mar ,” etc., she stands on the crescent moon. Like the old pagan Goddesses, she is the “Queen of Heaven,” and the “Morning Star” just as they were. Whether this can explain anything, is left to the reader’s sagacity. Meanwhile, Lucifer-Venus has nought to do with darkness, and everything with light. When called Lucifer, it is the “light-bringer,” the first radiant beam T HE H ISTORY OF A P LANET  19 which destroys the lethal dar k ness of night.

Professor Max Müller rightly conjectures that Aphrodite, born of the sea, is a personification of the Dawn of the Day, and the most lovely of all the sights in Nature ( Lectures on the Science of Language ) ,* for, before her naturalisation by the Greeks, Aphrodite was Nature personified, the life and light of the Pagan world, as proven in the beautiful invocation to Venus by Lucretius, quoted by Decharme. She is divine Nature in her entirety, Aditi-Prakriti before she becomes Lakshmi. She is that Nature before whose majestic and fair face, “the winds fly away, the quieted sky pours torrents of light, and the sea-waves smile” (Lucretius).† When referred to as the Syrian goddess Astarte, the Astaroth of Hieropolis, the radiant planet was personified as a majestic woman, holding in one out-stretched hand a torch, in the other, a crooked staff in the form of a cross. ( Vide Lucian’s De Dea Syria, and Cicero’s De Natura Deorum, lib. III, cap. xxiii.)‡ Finally, the planet is represented astronomically, as a globe poised above the cross— a symbol no devil would like to associate with—while the planet Earth is a globe with a cross over it. –––––––––– * [II, pp. 408-09, in 6th ed . , London: Longmans, Green & Co. 1871.] † [This passage is from Lucretius’ De rerum natura , lib.

The Hebrew expression in Isaiah , xiv, 12, hêl ē l bên shâ ƒ ar, appears in the Greek Septuagint as and in the Latin Vulgate as Lucifer qui m ane oriebaris, conveying the idea of “early rising,” both in Greek and in Latin.

The time has come when the veil of illusion is to be pulled aside entirely, not merely playfully, as hitherto done. For if mere members of the theosophical body have nothing to risk, except, perhaps, an occasional friendly stare and laugh at those who, without any special necessity, as believed, pollute the immaculate whiteness of their respectable society skirts by joining an unpopular movement, real theosophists ought to look truth and fact right in the face. To become a true theosophist— i.e. one thoroughly imbued with altruistic feelings, with a willingness to forget self, and readiness to help his neighbour to 32   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS carry the burden of life—is to b ecome instantaneously transformed into a public target. It is to make oneself a ready thing f or heavy “Mrs. Grundy” to sit upon: to become the object of ridicule, slander, and vilification, which will not stop even before an occasional criminal charge. For some theosophists, every move in the true theosophical direction , is a forlorn-hope enterprise. All this notwithstanding, the ranks of the “unpopular” society are steadily, if slowly increasing. For what does slander and ridicule really matter? When have fools ever been slandered, or rich and influential men and women ostracised, however black and soiled in their hearts, or in their secret lives? Who ever heard of a Reformer’s or an orator’s course of life running smooth? Who of them escaped from being pelted with dirt by his enemies? Gautama Buddha, the great Hindu Reformer, was charged by the Brahmins with being a demon, whose form was taken by Vishnu, to encourage men to despise the Vedas, deny the gods, and thus effect their own destruction. “Say we not well thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?” said the Pharisees to Jesus. “He deceiveth the people . . . Stone him to death ! ” “He who surpasses or subdues mankind, Must look down on the hate of those below,” * says the great English poet. The latter is echoed in prose by the King of French poets. Writes Victor Hugo: You have y o ur enemies; but who has not? Guizot has enemies, Thiers has enemies, Lamartine has enemies. Have I not been myse lf fighting for twenty years? Have I not been for twenty years past reviled, betrayed, sold, rended, hooted, taunted, insulted, calumniated? Have not my books been parodied, and my deeds travestied? I also am beset and spied upon, I also have traps laid for me, and I have even been made to fall into them. But what is all that to me? I disdain it. It is one of the most difficult yet necessary things in life to learn to disdain. Disdain protects and crushes. It is a breastplate and a club. You have enemies? Why, it is the story of every man who has done a great deed, created a new idea. It is the cloud which thunders around everything which shines. Do not trouble yourself about it.

At the tenth stage the brain and skull made their appearance, as in the lamprey; at the eleventh, the limbs and jaws were developed . . . . . the earth was then only in the Silurian period. At the sixteenth, the adaptation to terrestrial life ceased. At the seventeenth, which corresponds to the Jurassic phase of the history of the globe, the genealogy of man is raised to the kangaroo among the marsupials. At the eighteenth, he becomes a lemurian; the Tertiary period commences. At the nineteenth, he becomes a Catarrhinian, that is to say, an ape with a tail, a Pithecian. At the twentieth he becomes an anthropoid, continuing so throughout the whole of the Miocene period. At the twenty-first he becomes a man-ape, he does not possess language, nor in consequence the corresponding brain. Lastly, at the twenty-second, man comes forth . . . . in his inferior types.† –––––––––– * Mark well: when a theosophist or an occultist speaks of “spontaneous generation,” because for him there exists no inorganic matter in Kosmos—he is forthwith set down as an ignoramus.

We are not told by science the secret why, while ma n has had plenty of time to become, say a Plato, a Newton, a Napoleon, or even a Haeckel, his poor ancestor should have been arrested in his growth and development. For, as far as is known, the rump of the cynocephalus seems as blue and as callous to-day, as it was during the reign of Psammetichus or Cheops; the macacus must have made as ugly faces at Pliny 18 centuries back, as he does now at a Darwinian. We may be told that in the enormous period of time that must have elapsed since the beginning of evolution, 2,000 or even 10,000 years mean very little. But then, one does not find even the Moneron any better off for the millions of years that have rolled away. Yet, between the gelatinous and thoughtful hermit of the briny deep and man, there must have elapsed quite sufficient time for some trifling transformation. That primordial protoplasmic creature, however, seems to fare no better at the hands of evolution, which has well-nigh forgotten it. By this time, one should suppose that this ancestor of ours of stage one, ought to have reached, to say the least, a higher development; to have become, for instance, the amphibian “sozura” of the “fourteenth stage,” so minutely and scientifically described by Mr. Haeckel, and of which de Quatrefages so wickedly says in The Human Species (p. 108),* that it (the sozura) “is equally unknown to science. ” But we see quite the reverse. The tender-bodied little one, has remained but a moneron to this very hour; so much so, that Mr. Huxley, fishing him out from the abysmal ocean depths, took pity upon him, and gave him a father.

There is one trifle, however, which seems to have the best of even his capacity for getting out of a scientific dilemma, and this is the eighteenth stage of his genealogy in The Pedigree of Man.

S. B. makes some very pertinent remarks upon “Theosophical Fiction,” the growth of which is one sign of the times. “A true picture of life, either real or potential, which is found in a work of fiction, makes such reading one of the best sources of learning.” Thanks to the education which it is receiving from the more solid literature of Theosophy, the public is becoming more critical, and has already formed a “standard of probability” for marvellous phenomena, which acts as a healthy check upon outside writers of fiction, who are therefore no longer able to trust entirely “to their imagination for F ROM AN U NPOPULAR P HILOSOPHER  45 their acts, and to their memory f or their fancies.” Novel readers now like their supernatural not to be unnaturally supern a tural, even if they do have to take it in minute doses, disguised in their favourite draught of love, murder and small talk. “The Higher Carelessness” (No. 7 of “Thoughts in Solitude”), by “Pilgrim,”* is full of deep and beautiful reflections. This writer, like “American Mystic” whose article on the puzzling question, “Am I my Brother’s Keeper?” comes next, has advanced some way upon the path of knowledge, and the thoughts of both of them have a special interest for contemplative and self-examining readers. “American Mystic,” by-the-bye, gives a new and striking turn to a phrase too often misunderstood. “Resist not evil” he quotes and explains that resistance, fierce and personal, to evil befalling oneself, is what is meant. “Christianity—Theosophy,” by Mr. Wm.

Hatred is a concealed and forced homage rendered to the person hated; a tacit admission of the superiority of the unpopular character. The true value of back-biting and slander. A proof of the fast coming triumph of the victim chosen. The bite of the fly when the creature feels its end approaching.

Des qu’on parle de Boudhisme (avec un seul d ) ésotérique au public européen, si ignorant en matière d’Orientalisme, on le prend pour le Bouddhisme, ou la religion de Gautama Bouddha. «Bouddha» est le titre des sages et signifie «illuminé»; Boudhisme a pour racine le mot «Boudha» (sagesse, intelligence) personnifié dans les Pourânas. C’est le fils de Sôma (la lune au masculin ou Lunus) et de Târâ, l’épouse infidèle de Brihaspati (planète de Jupiter), la personnification du culte cérémoniel, du sacrifice et autres mômeries exotériques. Târâ est l’âme qui aspire à la vérité, se détourne avec horreur du dogme humain, prétendu divin, et se jette dans les bras de Sôma, le dieu du mystère, de la nature occulte, d’où nait Boudha (le fils brillant mais voilé) la personnification de la sagesse secrète, de l’Ésotérisme des sciences occultes.

Dans le premier cas, vous n’aidez pas seulement celui qui a besoin d’être aidé, mais vous prêchez d’exemple au paresseux et au mendiant; vous leur faites voir que vous ne considérez pas leur ouvrage prosaïque comme au-dessous de votre dignité, et vous lui inculquez ainsi le sentiment du respect et de l’estime pour lui-même, ainsi que la satisfaction de son lot. Si, d’un autre côté, vous persistez à travailler uniquement dans votre haute région intellectuelle et si vous donnez au pauvre le produit de votre labeur, cornme on fait l’aurnône à un mendiant, vous ne réussirez qu’à encourager sa paresse et le sentiment de son infériorité.

La vraie différence entre la science moderne et la science occulte se trouve dans ceci: La première oppose à une force naturelle une force naturelle plus puissante sur le plan physique; la deuxième oppose à une force physique une force spirituelle ou psychique, c’est-à-dire l’ âme de cette même force. Ceux qui ne croient pas à l’âme humaine, ni à l’Esprit immortel, ne peuvent admettre à fortiori, dans chaque atome de matière, une âme vitale et potentielle. Cette âme, humaine, animale, végétale ou minérale, n’est qu’un rayon prêté par l’âme universelle à chaque objet manifesté, pendant le cycle ou période active du Kosmos. Ceux qui rejettent cette doctrine sont, ou des matérialistes ou des cagots sectaires qui redoutent le mot de «Pantheisme» plus que le diable de leurs rêves malsains. L L’idée du «grand œuvre» associée à celle de Dieu et du Diable, ferait sourir de pitié un chéla de six mois. Les théosoph e s ne croient ni à l’un ni à l’autre.

Les théosophes voient dans le prêtre de n’importe quelle religion un être inutile quand il n’est pas pernicieux. Ils prêchent contre toutes les religions dogmatiques et infaillibles et ne connaissent d’autre divinité, dispensatrice des peines et des récompenses, que le Karma, divinité créée par leurs propres actions. Le seul Dieu qu’ils adorent est la V ÉRITÉ ; le seule diable qu’ils reconnaissent et qu’ils combattent avec acharn e ment, est le Satan de l’Égoïsme et des passions humaines. Il serait curieux de savoir ou «Aleph» est allé puiser sa connaissance de l’occultisme Indou. J’ai idée que c’est dans les romans Brahmes de Louis Jacolliot. Ah ça, il ne sait donc pas qu’à l’heure d’aujourd’hui, les Brahmes sont aussi ignorants des sciences occultes que les Bouddhistes de Ceylan! Sur sept clefs ésoteriques qui ouvrent le cabinet de Barbe-Bleue (l’occultisme), ils n’en possèdent qu’une seule—la clef physiologique ou l’aspect sexuel (phallique) de leurs symboles. Sur 150,000,000 de Brahmes, de tout degrés, on ne trouverait pas 150 initiés, aux Indes, en y comprenant leurs Yogis et Paramahansas. «Aleph» ne s’est donc jamais laissé dire que leurs temples étaient devenus des cimetières où gisent les cadavres de leurs beaux symboles d’autrefois et où règnent, suprêmes, la superstition et l’exploitation? S’il en était autrement, pourquoi donc les théosophes américains seraient-ils allés aux Indes? Pourquoi des milliers de Brahmes seraient-ils entrés dans la société théosophique, avides d’appartenir à un centre où ils pourraient rencontrer, de temps en temps, un vrai Mahatma en chair et en os, arrivant de l’autre côté de la «grande montagne»? Ah, «Aleph» ferait bien d’étudier la doctrine secrète et d’apprendre que l’aïeule rouge de l’Atlantide disparue (l’Atala de Sûrya Siddhânta et d’Asura Maya) avait pour bis-aïeule Vâhi Sarasvati sur l’île de Shambhala, lorsque l’Asie centrale n’était qu’une vaste mer, là où est maintenant le Tibet et le désert de Shamo ou de"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Gobi.

Pourquoi donc refuserait-il de voir un acte de sagesse, nécessité par l’expérience du cœur humain, dans la loi du silence, imposée aux Adeptes, au sujet des révélations occultes? M’est avis, cependant, que ce sont justement les classes intelligentes et riches qui abuseraient du pouvoir occulte à leur bénéfice et profit, bien plus que les classes ignorantes et pauvres. La première loi de la Science Sacrée, c’est de ne jamais user de son savoir dans son propre intérêt, mais de travailler avec et pour les autres. Or, combien trouverait-on, en Europe-Amérique, de gens prêts à se sacrifier pour le prochain? Un Adepte malade n’a pas le droit de dépenser sa force magnétique pour diminuer ses souffrances personnelles, tant qu’il se trouve, à sa connaissance, une seule créature qui souffre et dont il peut affaiblir, sinon guérir, la douleur physique ou mentale. C’est la déification de la souffrance du moi, au profit de la santé et du bonheur d’autrui. Un théosophe, s’il ambitionne l’Adeptat, ne doit pas se venger. Il doit souffrir en silence, plutôt que d’exciter chez un autre des passions mauvaises ou le désir de se venger à son tour. La non-résistance au mal, le pardon et la charité, sont les premières règles du noviciat. D’ailleurs, nul n’est tenu de se faire théosophe et encore moins de se faire recevoir candidat à l’Adeptat et à l’initiation occulte. N «Aleph» a encore une fois raison—en apparence; l’activité féroce de l’Europe-Amérique serait une c o mpagne turbulente pour le quiétisme asiatique.

Le Brahmanisme dont il parle n’existait pas du temps des Rishis et il a été parfaitement démontré que les Brahmes ont embelli leur loi de Manou, dans la période post-Mahabharatique. Durant l’âge Védique, les veuves se remariaient fort tranquillement et les castes ne furent inventées que dans l’âge du kali-youga, pour des raisons aussi occultes que justes, au point de vue de la prosperité et de la santé des races. Mais à quoi bon tout cela? Qu’avons-nous, théosophes, à faire avec le Brahmanisme, sauf pour le combattre dans ses abus, depuis neuf ans que la société théosophique est établie aux Indes? Ragunath Rao, un Brahme de la plus haute caste, qui a présidé pendant trois ans la Société théosophique de Madras, et qui est maintenant premier ministre (Dewan) chez le Holkar, est le réformateur le plus acharné de l’Inde. Il combat, comme tant d’autres théosophes, la loi du veuvage, s’appuyant sur les textes de Manou et du Véda.

C’est la perte des clefs des symboles et des lois de Manou, qui a produit toutes les erreurs, tous les abus intercalés dans le Brahmanisme. Mais alors même que ces allégations seraient exactes, qu’avons-nous à faire avec le Brahmanisme orthodoxe? Les horreurs décrites par Devendro Das, «la veuve Indoue» dans le Nineteenth Century, et citées contre les théosophes dans le même numero de la Revue du Mouvement social, page 333 (Janvier 1887), sont parfaitement vraies. Toutefois, Devendro Das étant théosophe depuis 1879, on devrait comprendre, enfin, que les théosophes combattent le Brahmanisme des pagodes, comme toutes les superstitions, tous les abus, toutes les injustices. P Puisqu’il ressort de la façon d’agir des théosophes boudhistes, serviteurs de la Sagesse et de la Vérité, qu’ils n’appart i ennent à aucune religion, à aucune secte, mais qu’ils combattent, au contraire, les cultes exotériques, les abus qui en découlent et qu’ils s’efforcent, enfin, d’être utiles à l’humanité, les réflexions «d’Aleph» deviennent injustes. Or la présente explication devrait suffir à rétablir, enfin, la vérité sur les «missionnaires» de l’Himalaya.

Nous brisons leurs idoles; ils essaient de briser nos réputations et de salir notre honneur; ceux qui agissent de la sorte sont principalement les serviteurs du Christ, de celui qui, le premier, défendit de prier «le Père» dans les temples, comparant les hypocrites aux pharisiens qui font des actes de pitié dans tous les carrefours, semblables à des sépulcres blanchis au dehors et pleins de pourriture au dedans. Cependant les «Bonzes», les prêtres Bouddhistes, sont, il faut l’avouer, les seuls qui nous aient vraiment aidés dans nos réformes. Jamais la voix d’un prêtre de Gautama ne s’est élevée contre nous. Toujours, les Bouddhistes de Ceylan furent de vrais frères pour les théosophes d’Europe ou d’Amérique. Que se passe-t-il dans le Tibet? Une chose remarquable entre autre, qui a frappé les rares missionnaires venus dans ce pays: dans la pleine activité des rues, à midi, tous les marchands boutiquiers, dont la marchandise est étalée au dehors, s’en vont chez eux, laissant ainsi leur bien sur les trottoirs et presque en pleine rue; les acheteurs qui surviennent voient le prix marqué des objets dont ils ont besoin, emportent ces objets, en déposant la valeur sur le comptoir, et à son retour le marchand retrouve le prix des marchandises enlevées; le reste demeure intact. Voilà cependant quelque chose qu’on ne trouverait guère en Europe-Amérique; et ce n’est pourtant que le résultat des commandements exotériques de Gautama Bouddha—lequel ne fut qu’un sage et n’a jamais été déifié. Il n’y a pas non plus, au Tibet, de mendiants ni de gens qui meurent de faim; l’ivrognerie et le crime y sont inconnus, ainsi que l’immoralité—sauf parmi les Chinois, qui ne sont pas des «Bouddhistes» dans le vrai sens du mot, pas plus que les Mormons ne sont des chrétiens.

Il est une absurdité plus grande que de parler de Dieu cruel; c’est d’admettre même que Dieu le grand Tout absolu, puisse jamais se mêler des affaires terrestres ou humaines. L’Infini ne peut s’associer au fini; l’Inconditionné ignore le conditionné et le limité. La «SagesseIntelligence» absolue ne peut agir dans l’espace restreint d’un petit globe. Elle est omniprésente et latente dans le Kosmos infini comme elle; et nous en retrouvons la seule manifestation vraiment active dans l’humanité totale, composée des étincelles égarées, limitées dans leur durée objective, éternelles dans leur essence, qui sont tombées de ce Foyer sans commencement ni fin. Donc, le seul Dieu que nous devons servir c’est l’Humanité et notre seul culte est l’amour du prochain. En faisant du mal à ce prochain, nous blessons et faisons souffrir Dieu.

The Theosophists, even in India, protest against the Yogism of the fakirs. A solitary ascetic is a symbol of the most cowardly egotism; a hermit who flees from his brothers instead of helping them to carry the burden of life, to work for others, and to put their shoulders to the wheel of social life, is a coward who hides himself when the battle is on, and goes to sleep drunk on an opiate. Asceticism, as understood by exoteric religions, has produced the ignorant fools who throw themselves under the chariot of Juggernaut. If these unfortunate people had studied the esoteric philosophy, they would know that under the dead letter of the dogma taught by the Brâhmanas—exploiters, like all priests, inheritors of the possessions of their victims, who are driven to madness by superstitious terrors—is hidden a profoundly philosophical meaning; they would know that their bodies which they crush under the wheels of the chariot of Jagan-nâtha ( Juggernaut in popular dialect—meaning Lord of the World or Anima mundi ) are the symbols of the gross material passions which this “chariot” (the divine and spiritual soul) must crush. Knowing this they would not apply the moral and spiritual asceticism taught by esotericism to their bodies—the mere outer animal husk of the god which is latent within. The Theosophists of India labor to destroy exoteric asceticism, or the “deification of suffering,” veritable Satanism of superstition.

Universal Esotericism preserved by certain cosmopolitan fraternities, and the key to which has long since been lost by the Brâhmanas in general, presents a cosmic and human genesis which is logical and based on natural sciences, as well as on a pure transcendental philosophy. Judeo-Christian exotericism gives but an allegory based on the same esoteric truth, but so smothered under the dead letter that it is taken for mere fiction. Jewish Kabbalists understand it to some extent.

When one speaks of esoteric Budhism (with one d ) to the European public—so ignorant of oriental matters—it is mistaken for Buddhism, the religion of Gautama the Buddha. “Buddha” is a title of the sages and means the “illumined one”; Budhism comes from the word “Budha” (wisdom, intelligence) personified in the Purâ n as . He is the son of Soma (the moon in its masculine aspect or Lunus) and Târâ, the un fai thful wife of Brihaspati (the planet Jupiter), the personification of ceremonial cult, of sacrifice and other exoteric mummeries. Târâ is the soul which aspires to truth, turns away in horror from human dogma which claims to be divine, and rushes into the arms of Soma , god of mystery, of occult nature, whence is born Budha (the veiled but brilliant son), the personification of secret wisdom , of the Esotericism of the occult sciences. This Budha is by thousands of years older than the year 600 (or 300 according to certain Orientalists) before the Christian era, date assigned to the appearance of Gautama the Buddha, prince of Kapilavastu. Budhist esotericism has therefore nothing to do with the Buddhist religion, and the good and revered Sumangala has nothing to do with Theosophy in India.

Whereas the Theosophists are the only ones at present to preach this sublime altruism (even if two-thirds of The Theosophical Society should have failed in this duty), and some of them alone, in the midst of a defiant and sneering mob sacrifice themselves body and soul, honor and possessions, ready to live misunderstood and derided, if only they can succeed in sowing the good seed of a harvest which will not be theirs to reap, those who are interested in the destiny of the miserable people should at least abstain from vilifying them. J and K There is but one way of ever ameliorating human life and it is by the love of one’s fellow man for his own sake and n o t for personal gratification. The greatest Theosophist—he who loves divine truth under all its forms—is the one who works for and with the poor. There is a man known to the entire intellectual Europe-America who possibly may never have heard the name of The Theosophical Society; I mean Count Leo N. Tolstoy, author of War and Peace. This great writer is a perfect model for all aspirants to true Theosophy. He is the first in European aristocracy to have solved this problem: “What can I do to make happy any poor man whom. I may meet?” This is what he says: I think that it is the duty of everyone to work for all who may need help; to work with the hands, remember, a certain portion of your 78  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS day. It is more practical to wo r k with and for the poor man than to give him a portion of your intellectual labor. In the first case you help not only him who needs to be helped, but you preach by means of example to the lazy one and the beggar; you show them that you do not consider their prosaic work as being below your dignity, and thus you inculcate in him the feeling of respect and esteem for himself and of satisfaction with his destiny. If, however, you persist in working solely in your own high intellectual region and give to the poor the product of your labor, as one gives alms to the beggar, you will succeed only in encouraging his laziness and his feeling of inferiority. In doing so you establish a difference of social caste between yourself and him who accepts your alms. You take away from him his self-esteem and his confidence in you and you suggest to him aspirations to shake off the hard conditions of his existence, spent in daily physical labor, to associate himself with your life which appears to him easier than his own, to wear your garb which seems to him more beautiful than his own, and to obtain access to your social position which he considers superior to his own. It is not in this manner, owing to scientific and intellectual progress, that we can ever hope to assist the poor, or to inculcate into humanity the idea of a true fraternity. In India the Theosophical “missionaries” labor towards the eradication of the caste idea and with a view to uniting all th e castes in their fraternity. We have already seen—a thing incredible and impossible before their arrival in the country of the Sacred Cows and the Bull-Gods—Brâhma Š a and Pariah, Hindû and Buddhist, Parsi and Mohammedan, seated at the same table. When we see in republican France aristocrats and financiers keep company with their laundrymen, or a lady of society, proud of her democratic sentiments, help a poor farmer’s wife plant her cabbage, as is done by the daughter of Count Tolstoy and by the real European Theosophists at Madras and elsewhere—then we may say that"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"there is hope for the poor in Europe. “Aleph” confuses the priests of the public temple with the Initiates of the Sanctuaries. These latter never believed in an anthropomorphic God. The history that he gives us of the evolution of occult sciences and of the magnetic power is a fantasy. His description shows much imagination but very little knowledge of the procedures employed for the acquisition of “occult” powers. M ISCONCEPTIONS   79 Astrology is the mother of Ast r onomy, and Alchemy is the mother of Chemistry, just as the plastic soul is the mothe r of primitive physical man. Astrology and Alchemy are equally the soul of the two modern sciences. As long as this truth is not recognized, Astronomy and Chemistry will continue to run in a vicious circle and will produce nothing beyond materiality. To say that occult sciences claim to command nature arbitrarily, is equivalent to saying that the sun commands the day-star to shine. Occult sciences are nature itself; intimate knowledge of their secrets does not give to the Initiates the power to command them. The truth of it is that this knowledge teaches the Adepts the manner in which to furnish certain conditions for the production of phenomena, always due to natural causes, and to the combination of forces analogous to those used by the scientists. The real difference between modern science and occult science consists in this: The first opposes to a natural force another natural force more powerful on the physical plane; the second opposes to a physical force, a spiritual or psychic force, in other words, the soul of that same force. Those who do not believe in the human soul nor in the immortal spirit cannot recognize a fortiori a vital and potential soul in every atom of matter. This soul, whether human, animal, vegetable, or mineral, is but a ray loaned by the Universal Soul to every manifested object during the active cycle or period of the Kosmos. Those who reject this doctrine are either materialists or sectarian bigots who dread the word “Pantheism” more than the devil of their unwholesome dreams. L The idea of the “Great Work” associated with the idea of God and Devil would make any chela of six months smile i n pity. Theosophists do not believe either in the one or in the other. They believe in the Great A LL , in Sat, i.e., absolute and infinite existence, unique and with nothing like unto it, whi ch is neither a Being nor an anthropomorphic creature, which is, and can never not 80   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS be.

It would be curious to learn where “Aleph” went to obtain his information on Hindû occultism. I have an idea that it was from the Brâhmanical romances of Louis Jacolliot. Well, he evidently does not know that at present the Brâhmanas are as ignorant of the occult sciences as the Buddhists of Ceylon! Of the seven esoteric keys which open Bluebeard’s closet (occultism) they possess only one—the physiological key or the sexual “phallic” aspect of their symbols. In India, among the 150,000,000 Brâhmanas of every degree, one would not find 150 initiates, including the Yogis and Paramahamsas. “Aleph” has never heard, it would seem, that their temples have become cemeteries where lie the corpses of their once beautiful symbols and where reign supreme superstition and exploitation. If it were different, why would American Theosophists have gone to India? Why would have thousands of Brâhma n as entered The Theosophical Society eager to belong to a centre where they mi gh t encounter from time to time a true Mahâtman of flesh and blood from the other side of the “great mountain”? “Aleph” would do well to study The Secret Doctrine and to learn that the red forefather of the vanished Atlantis (the Atala of the Sûrya-Siddhânta and of Asuramaya) had for still older forbear Vâhi Sarasvatî on the island of Ś ambhala, when Central Asia was but a vast sea where today is Tibet and the desert of Shamo or Gobi. M “Aleph” recognizes the need of keeping secret dangerous sciences — chemistry for instance—and not d isclosing to the crowd, even in civilized countries, the mystery of M ISCONCEPTIONS   81 certain death-dealing combin a tions. Why should he then refuse to see in the law of silence forced upon Adepts, in connectio n with occult revelations, an act of wisdom, necessitated by the experience of the human heart? I suspect, however, that it is precisely the intelligent and rich classes which would abuse occult powers for their own benefit and profit, much more than the ignorant and poor ones. The first law of the Sacred Science is never to use one’s knowledge for one’s own interest, but to work with and for others. But how many people could one find in Europe-America ready to sacrifice themselves for their fellowmen? An Adept who is sick has no right to use his magnetic force to lessen his personal suffering as long as there is, to his knowledge, a single creature that suffers and whose physical or mental pain he can lessen, if not heal. It is so to speak the exaltation of the suffering of one’s self, for the benefit of the health and happiness of others. A Theosophist, if he contemplates Adeptship, must not revenge himself. He must suffer in silence rather than excite in someone else evil passions or the desire to revenge himself in his turn. Non-resistance to evil, forgiveness"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"and charity, are the first rules of discipleship. However, no one is expected to become a Theosophist and even less to make himself accepted as a candidate for Adeptship and occult initiation. N “Aleph” is right once more—in appearance; the feverish activity of Europe-America would be turbulent company for A siatic quietism. However, polarity alone can produce the phenomenon of vitality, just as it produces, through the union of positive and negative forces, the phenomenon of gravitation. Two similar poles repel each other; as an example, see the entente cordiale, the sweet brotherhood which reigns among the Occidental nations. If the fusion of contraries does not come about, if the Englishman does not openly acknowledge 82   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS the Hindû as his brother, and doe s not act towards him accordingly, the nations of Europe-America will end one day b y devouring each other, leaving on the battlefield nothing but their tails as did the Kilkenny cats. O When criticizing Brâhmanism, “Aleph” is dead right, only he should know that the Brâhmanas in Vedic times knew n e ither castes nor widows from Malabar. His questionnaire under the letter N proves to me conclusively that he has read Jacolliot and that he judges India according to the twenty-one volumes of a writer, more prolific and charming than accurate. The Brâhmanism of which he speaks did not exist in the age of the Rishîs and it has been definitely shown that the Brâhmanas have embellished their laws of Manu in the post-Mahâbhâratean period. During the Vedic age widows remarried quite peacefully and the castes were invented but in the Kali-yuga, for reasons as occult as they were just, from the standpoint of the prosperity and the health of the races. But what is the good of this? What do we Theosophists have to do with Brâhmanism, except to combat its abuses, since The Theosophical Society was established in India nine years ago. Ragunath Rao, a Brâhmana of the highest caste, who has presided for three years over The Theosophical Society of Madras, and who is at present Prime Minister (Dewan) of the Holkar, is the most fervent reformer in India. He is fighting, as so many other Theosophists, the law of widowhood, on the strength of texts from Manu and the Vedas. He has already freed several hundred young widows, destined to celibacy because of the loss of their husbands in their childhood, and he has made possible their remarriage in spite of the hue and cry of protest on the part of orthodox Brâhmanas. He laughs at castes; and the one hundred odd Theosophical Branches in India help him in this all-out war against superstition and ecclesiastical cruelty."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME VIII M ISCONCEPTIONS   83 It is wrong to say that these ins t itutions have been established during the reign of Esotericism. It is the loss of the k e ys to symbolism and to the laws of Manu which has produced all the errors and all the abuses that have infiltrated into Brâhmanism. But even if these allegations were correct, what do we have in common with orthodox Brâhmanism? The horrors described by Devendro Das in “The Hindû Widow,” in the Nineteenth Century, and quoted against the Theosophists in the same issue of the Revue du Mouvement Social , p . 333 (January 1887), are entirely true. However, Devendro Das having been a Theosophist since 1879, it should be clear at last that the Theosophists fight the Brâhmanism of the pagodas, as they do all the superstitions, all the abuses, and all the injustices. P As it would appear from the behavior of Budhist Theosophists, servants of Wisdom and Truth, that they belong to no re l igion, to no sect, and that on the contrary they combat all exoteric cults and the abuses which follow therefrom, and that they endeavor to be useful to humanity, the reflections of “Aleph” are unjust. The present explanation should be sufficient to finally reestablish the truth concerning the “missionaries.” of the Himâlayas. It is precisely because occult science and esoteric philosophy have “for pivotal function the service of humanity,” because their ardent advocates try to awaken European and Asiatic peoples sleeping under the deathly shadows of clericalism, by reminding them of the lessons of the ancient wisdom—it is on account of these motives that these servants offer themselves to Europe-America. Those who would still doubt it are asked to judge the tree of Theosophy by its fruits; for by judging it by the fruits of the tree of the Brâmanical, Buddhist, or Judeo-Christian religions, they commit an evident injustice and prevent the Theosophists from being useful to their fellows, more especially to the disinherited ones of the world. 84   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS As we have already mentioned the good old Sumangala elsewhere, there is no need of our wasting time in repudiating a ny solidarity with Bonzes or Brâhmanas.

Ceylon Buddhists have always been true brothers to the Theosophists of both Europe and America. What is happening in Tibet? The few missionaries who were able to get into that land have been struck by one remarkable fact: in the midst of the street activities at noon all the shopkeepers go home leaving all their merchandise spread openly on the sidewalk and almost on the street itself; the buyers who happen to come by see the prices marked on the articles they need, so they take them and leave their money on the counter. Upon his return, the merchant finds the payment for the merchandise that was taken; the rest remains intact . Now this is something that could hardly be found in Europe-America. This is, however, but the result of the exoteric commandments of Gautama the Buddha—who was but a sage and has never been deified. There are also no beggars in Tibet, nor people dying from hunger. Drunkenness and crime are unknown there, as well as immorality, except among the Chinese who are not “Buddhists” in the real sense of the word, no more than the Mormons are Christians.

Did he find it in London with its four million inhabitants, one million of which eat but every three days, if that often? Is it in America, where progress necessitates the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Chinese laborers, sent elsewhere to die from hunger, and the immediate expulsion of thousands of Irish immigrants and other paupers of which England is trying to rid itself? A progress built on the exploitation of poor people and of laborers is but another car of Juggernaut plus a false nose. One has the right to prefer even a quiet death under the manchineel tree to the progress of the rich and learned classes achieved over the bodies of thousands of poor and ignorant people. The Chinese of California, are they not our brothers? The Irish driven from their huts and condemned with their children to die of hunger, do they prove the existence of social progress? No, a thousand times no! As long as people, instead of fraternizing with and helping each other, claim but the right to safeguard their national interests, while the rich man refuses to understand that in helping a poor stranger he helps his poor brother in the future, and sets a good example for other countries; as long as the feeling of international altruism remains an empty phrase in the air, progress will accomplish no other function than that of executioner of the poor."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"R Let us understand each other.

Why the entities of the hierarchy which compose it should not succeed each other like the members of the species which populate our globe and the others. Is not the idea of the formation of worlds by other worlds, and of universes by other universes more rational by analogy than that of Moses or even of Laplace? “Aleph” teaches thus pure Theosophy; he is therefore a Theosophist and a “ Budhist missionary” without knowing it; we hail him and welcome him with open arms.

This is proven by the law of Manu which enjoins marriage to the Grihastha Brâhmana, before he becomes an ascetic Brâhmana. The greatest misfortune for a Brâhmana is not to have a son, and marriage is obligatory barring the exceptional cases when the child is destined to become a Brahmachârin, a Yogi celibate, for occult reasons which cannot be enumerated here.

M ISCONCEPTIONS   89 “Aleph” probably speaks of Ch r istian ascetics, those who plunge themselves into exoteric asceticism, a blessed r osary in their hands and the dogmas of the church in their heads. The Hindû becomes an ascetic only after having sufficiently studied the occult sciences to allow his spiritual nature to control his material nature. “Aleph” surely confuses the ascetics of India with the Spiritualistic mediums of Europe-America. The latter, poor sensitives and neurotics, ignore the esoteric laws, and it is they who end by creating incubi and succubi—as is proven by the discarnate wives of certain mediums in Paris itself. The comparison between the “God of the past” and the “God of science” is neither a just nor a happy one as the reigns of these two Gods differ very little from each other.

Alone, the intelligent socialists have understood us; will they also turn against us? In the meantime, “Aleph” makes us listen to some profound truths. Yes, exoteric Brâhmanism must fall, but it will be replaced by esoteric Vedism, to which will be added everything noble and beautiful that progressive science has evolved in this last century. But this revolution will not be accomplished by conquerors; it is by means of brotherly love that the fusion of the two Âryan races will be brought about, and only when the Englishman will have ceased to look upon the Brâhmana—whose genealogical tree encompasses three thousand years—as the representative of an inferior race. In his turn, the Brâhmana hates the Englishman whose temporary rule he is forced to endure. The brotherhood of the Theosophists throughout India are the only ones to see the haughty Englishman sitting down at the same table with equally arrogant Brâhmanas, mellowed and humanized by the example and the lessons of the Theosophists who serve the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, the descendants of those Rishis and Mahâtmans which Brâhmanism has always revered, though it has ceased to understand them. It follows, therefore, from all that precedes, that it is not the “priesthood of India” that attempts to bring the Occident back to the ancient wisdom, but rather a few Occidentals from Europe-America who, led by their Karma to the happiness of knowing certain Adepts of the secret Himâlayan Brotherhood, attempt, under the inspiration of these Masters, to lead the priesthood of India back to the primitive and divine esotericism.

This remarkable story is from the pen of Mabel Collins (Mrs. Kenningale Cook) and is signed simply “M.C.” It is introduced with a brief Note by the author saying that: “This strange story has come to me from a far country and was brought to me in a mysterious manner; I claim only to be the scribe and the editor. In this capacity, however, it is I who am answerable to the public and the critics. I therefore ask in advance, one favour only of the 92  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS reader; that he will accept (while reading this story) the theory of the reincarnation of souls as a living fact.” Running into thirty-five chapters, this story appeared serially throughout the First and Second Volumes of Lucifer, being concluded in the issue of August, 1888. According to the Preface, signed by “M.C.;” which was appended to this story when it was republished in book-form (New York: John W. Lovell Company, 1889, pp. 290), with a sub-title reading “A True Story of a Black Magician,” this occult tale “shows the struggles and mistakes of one who has been an adept in black magic, and who is endeavoring with great force, but very blindly, to reach towards the White Brotherhood and learn good instead of evil.” Fleta, the chief character of the story, who, in her earlier incarnation, had taken power selfishly into her own hands, became by virtue of that power a black magician, an individual who has attained knowledge, but uses it for selfish ends. In her present incarnation, she attempts to attract the companion of many of her past lives, in order to bring him directly under the influence of Ivan, a member of the White Brotherhood who is trying to help Fleta to find her way towards the true Path. As “M.C.” says: “Her aim is to begin the occultist’s great work of saving others, especially those whom she has formerly injured.... We see her falling back instinctively on her old rites and using her old powers. . .” Eventually, through soul-searching trials and terrible tests, she wins her freedom and finds once more the noble, selfless Path.

P. Blavatsky, has quite recently come into my hands and, like all her writings, will repay perusal.” No other information was given as to the possible date when it was written. Internal evidence, however, shows that it was penned at the time when considerable discussion took place in the pages of Lucifer on the subject of Hylo-Idealism. This was in the Fall of 1887, soon after the launching of Lucifer. In her “Literary Jottings “ published in the September issue of that journal (Vol. I, pp. 71-75), H. P. B. makes use of several expressions from the same pamphlet by “C. N.” which is being quoted from in the present article. It is therefore fairly safe to assume that the latter was written at approximately the same time, which gives us sound reasons for inserting it in its present place.— Compiler. ] That which is herein presented will be, as a matter of course, Dead Sea fruit to blind materialism; withal it may pro v e still more distasteful to advocates of Hylo-ldealism—as that modern cross-breed between misunderstood Protagoras and Buchner is now named. Theosophy has no bitterer enemy than Hylo-Idealism, the great ally of materialism, to-day. This is because, though repudiating the systems of both, we accept most 94   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS of the physical facts of scie nce, rejecting their conclusions only; while we recognize a good deal of the Vedântic doctr i nes in European Idealism, but none of its highly philosophical and consistent logic. The conclusions of Materialism and Idealism, in fact, are so far stretched, that in their final synthesis they almost meet in their atheism and pessimism. The last word of both—the Alpha and the Omega of Modern Thought, whether traced to the potencies of brute matter, or to the nihilism of idealistic speculation—is a dreary negation of any possible future existence in spirit. Apparently there is an abyss between the two in sober reality—a platform on which both shake hands. The materialism of to-day is only a shade more scientific than the crass fallacies of Büchner and Moleschott. It is the same Death’s Head, with its stereotyped rictus grinning hideously, but now crowned with a wreath of rhetorical flowers woven by Mr. Tyndall’s unparalleled oratory. As to Idealism—of whatever school—it has become “a double caricature” on Kant and Schopenhauer. The “rigour and vigour” type of generalization is prevalent; witness the attitude of Materialists (or Realists) and Idealists toward what J. S. Mill terms the “battle-ground of metaphysics”—the question of an external world. The Materialist asserts that matter—or the external Universe—exists independently of a perceiving mind; that the object in short has evolved the subject, which latter in its turn"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"mirrors its author in its consciousness. The (pure) Idealist, on the contrary will say—“Not so; so far from Mind being the resultant of an evolutionary process from Matter, the latter exists only in consciousness. All we know, or can know, are states of our own consciousness; objects are such only by and through a perceiving Ego— its sensations, and as such, are necessarily phenomenal; with the destruction of Mind, the whole fabric of seeming objectivity collapses.” In what respect is such an idealist more “ideal” than the Materialist? One denies point blank anything existing outside of matter; the other, that anything is—no more matter than Spirit—that these two positions do not M ODERN I DEALISM  95 exhaust the alternatives. Whi l e it is clear that the Realist is unable to postulate the independent existence of the Ex t ernal World, except by projecting into space the visions of his own subjectivity, the ( pure ! ) Idealist is brought face to face with the assertion of science, that the objective universe existed aeons before the first dawn of human consciousness. It is from this predicament that we might be rescued by the compromise between the two opposing systems, known variously as Transfigured Realism, Transcendental Realism or, better, objective (as opposed to pure) Idealism—if only that transfigured Realism were to conceive of Object and Subject in the way Vedântic occultists do. According to this system, the external world of this our present consciousness is the joint product of Object and Subject. While non-existent per se— it is said, the creation of the individual mind—matter is equally the sensible manifestation of the objectivity of an unknown Substance (unknown to—the profane only). Mind translates the impressions received from without—impressions radiating from the world of Noumena into panorama of purely subjective ideation. The object as it is given in consciousness is phenomenal, but the primary stimulus comes from without. Subject and Object—as Noumena— are equally real, but the SENSE - OBJECT is a subjective creation. Take, for example, the case of the Sun. To the Realist the glorious orb ex i sts outside of, and independently of Mind, just as it appears in consciousness. To the Idealist it is the creation of Mind and perishes with it. To the objective Idealist, with Mind perishes the phenomenal Sun, but an unknown Substance—removed beyond the possibility of human conception as to its nature—remains. This—except the “Unknown Substance”—the Occultist will deny. For him, the subject as much as the object, Ego, Sun, Mind and the Universe itself is—a Mâyâ , a huge illusion. But, as both the Perceiver and the Object perceived belong to the same plane of illusion, they are mutual and reciprocal Realities for such time as the Manvantaric illusion lasts. In Reality, and outside and beyond Space and Time, it is all the effect and result of 96   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" Ignorance. Nevertheless, reverting to the conclusion of one of the greatest thinkers of the day—Mr. Herbert Spencer, where he argues that “If, then, the object perceived is self, what is the subject that perceives?”—and concludes that such a process is only conceivable on “the annihilation of both” ( First Principles , p. 66) *—we say that according to the views of the Occultist he is entirely wrong. Mr. Herbert Spencer knows, it appears, of but one grade of subjectivity, and has no idea of the occult ( Yogic ) teaching, of the existence of other and higher planes of consciousness, vision or perception, than those of Mind; of the existence, in short, of the “Transcendental Ego” or true self (Buddhi)—a spark from the radiant essence of the Universal Spirit. Consequently, to the query of Mr. Spencer—”If it is the true self which thinks, what other self can it be that is thought of?” ( ibid. ) we reply. The true Self is per se, impersonal; the personal or brain-consciousness being but an illusory reflection in incarnated existence. Western Psychology errs in regarding this personal ego as the only factor to be considered in its researches. The argument, therefore, as to the inconceivability of the Subject perceiving itself—which, if we limit subject to Mind (Manas) is absolutely valid—collapses the moment we assert with Kant and his modern exponents, the existence of a Higher Self or “Transcendental subject.” For, in the act of self-analysis, the Mind becomes in its turn an object to the spiritual consciousness. It is the overshadowing of the Mind by Buddhi which results in the ultimate realization of existence—i.e., self-consciousness in its purest form. But it must at the same time be borne in mind that the full realization of the spiritual Self is impossible for an incarnated 4th Rounder. The Spiritual ego reflects no varying states of consciousness; is independent of all sensation (experience); it does not think— it KNOWS , by an intuitive process only faintly conceivable by the average man . “ The subject that perceives” Mind, as an –––––––––– * [p. 55 in 6th edition, 1927.— Co mp. ] –––––––––– M ODERN I DEALISM  97 attribute of itself, is this Tra n scendental or spiritual Ego (Buddhi). He who would know more, let him study Vedanta and P atañjali’s Yoga Philosophy— esoterically. Let him understand the real meaning of these sentences: “The knower of SELF passes beyond sorrow” ( Chhândogya Upanishad , VII, i, 3); and again “he who knows the Supreme Brahman, becomes Brahman” ( Mundaka Upanishad, III, ii, 9). It is the “collective aggregate of Ignorance ,” as the Vedântasâra puts it, that led to scientific definitions by opponents; as one for instance that we find among the many pearls scattered by Dr. Lewins’ What is Religion.* For the beauty and clearness of language, we recommend it; and though its critic ( An Examination and Popular Exposition of the Hylo-Idealistic Philosophy, by Wm. Bell McTaggart †) recommends likewise the reader to remember that “Dr. Lewins’ philosophy does not lie on the surface” (Preface), yet one may be excused, for insisting on a close scrutiny of a system which aims at supplanting every philosophy, archaic, ancient or non-existent, by Hylo-Idealism, which, it is claimed, is the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"scientific union of Materialism and Idealism—or that of oil and water; as says the reviewer—“matter, matter, everywhere,” and justly adds of the pure Materialistic and Idealistic hypotheses that “both positions lead to gross—nay unthinkable —absurdities of thought” (p. 3).

The educated mind is most undeniably attempting to free itself from the heavy fetters of materialism. The ugly caterpillar is writhing in the agonies of death, under the powerful efforts of the psychic butterfly to escape from its science-built prison, and every day brings some new glad tidings of one or more such mental births to light. As the New York Path truly remarks in its September issue [p. 186], when “Theosophical and kindred topics” T HE S IGNS OF THE T IMES  99 are “made the texts for novels ,” and, we may add, scientific essays and brochures , “the implication is that inter e st in them has become diffused through social ranks.” That kind of literature is “paradoxically proof that Occultism has passed beyond the region of careless amusement and entered that of serious inquiry.” The reader has but to throw a retrospective glance at the publications of the last few years to find that such topics as Mysticism, Magic, Sorcery, Spiritualism, Theosophy, Mesmerism, or, as it is now called, Hypnotism, all the various branches in short of the Occult side of nature, are becoming predominant in every kind of literature. They visibly increase in proportion to the efforts made to discredit the movements in the cause of truth, and strangle enquiry—whether on the field of theosophy or spiritualism—by trying to besmear their most prominent heralds, pioneers and defenders, with tar and feathers. The key-note for mystic and theosophic literature was F. Marion Crawford’s Mr. Isaacs. It was followed by his Zoroaster. Then followed The Romance of Two Worlds, by Marie Corelli; R. Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; A Fallen Idol, by F. Anstey; King Solomon’s Mines and the thrice famous She by Henry Rider Haggard; Affinities and The Brother of the Shadow, by Mrs. Campbell-Praed; Edmund Downey’s House of Tears, and many others less noticeable. And now there comes a fresh outburst in Florence Marryat’s A Daughter of the Tropics, and F. C. Philips’ The Strange Adventures of Lucy Smith. It is unnecessary to mention in detail the literature produced by avowed theosophists and occultists, some of whose works are very remarkable, while others are positively scientific, such as S. L. MacGregor Mathers’ The Kabbalah Unveiled, and Dr. F. Hartmann’s Paracelsus; Magic, White and Black, etc. We have also to note the fact that theosophy has now crossed the Channel, and is making its way into French literature. La France publishes a strange romance by Ch. Chincholle,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"pregnant with theosophy, occultism and mesmerism, and called “La Grande Prêtresse,” while La Revue politique et littéraire (19 Feb., 1887, et seq. ) contained over the signature of 100   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS Th. Bentzon, a novel called “Émanci pée,” wherein esoteric doctrines and adepts are mentioned in conjunction with t he names of well-known theosophists. A sign of the times! Literature—especially in countries free from government censorship—is the public heart and pulse. Besides the glaring fact that were there no demand there would be no supply, current literature is produced only to please, and is therefore evidently the mirror which faithfully reflects the state of the public mind. True, conservative editors, and their submissive correspondents and reporters, still go on slashing occasionally in print the fair faces of mystic spiritualism and theosophy, and some of them are still found, from time to time, indulging in a brutal personal attack. But they do no harm on the whole, except perhaps to their own editorial reputations, as such editors can never be suspected of an exuberance of culture and good taste after certain ungentlemanly personal attacks. They do good on the contrary. For, while the theosophists and spiritualists so attacked, may view the Billingsgate poured upon them in a true Socratean spirit, and console themselves with the knowledge that none of the epithets used can possibly apply to them, on the other hand, too much abuse and vilification generally ends by awakening the public sympathy for the victim, in the right-minded and the impartial, at any rate. In England people seem to like fair play on the whole. It is not bashiboozook -like actions, the doughty deeds of those who delight in mutilating the slain and the wounded, that can find sympathy for any great length of time with the public. If—as maintained by our lay enemies and repeated by some naïf and too sanguine missionary organs—Spiritualism and Theosophy are “dead as a door nail” ( sic, vide American Christian periodicals),—aye, “dead and buried,” why, in such case, good Christian fathers, not leave the dead at rest till “Judgment Day”?

And if they are not, why should Agnostics and searchers after truth in general, help bigoted and narrow-minded materialists, sectarians and dogmatists to hide our light under a bushel by mere brutal force and usurped authority? It is easy to surprise the good faith of the fair-minded. Still easier to discredit that, which by its intrinsic strangeness, is already unpopular and could hardly be credited in its palmiest days. “We welcome no supposition so eagerly as one which accords with and intensifies our own prejudices says, in Don Gesualdo, a popular author.*.

That c o ld and artificial light which still seems to shine so dazzlingly over the alleged iniquities of professional mediums and the supposed sins of commission and omission of non-professional experimentalists, of free and independent theosophists, may yet be extinguished at the height of all its glory. For it is not quite the perpetual lamp of the alchemist philosopher. Still less is it that “light which never shone on sea or land,” that ray of divine intuition, the spark which glimmers latent in the spiritual, never-erring perceptions of man and woman, and which is now awakening—for its time is at hand. A few years more, and the Aladdin’s lamp, which called forth the ministering genius thereof, who, making three salutes to the public, proceeded forthwith to devour mediums and theosophists, like a juggler who swallows swords at a village fair, will get out of order. Its light, over which the anti-theosophists are crowing victory to this day, shall get dim. And then, perhaps, it will be discovered that what was claimed as a direct ray from the source of eternal truth was no better than a penny rush-light, in whose deceitful smoke and soot people got hypnotized, and saw everything upside down. It will be found that the hideous monsters of fraud and imposture had no existence outside the murky and dizzied brains of the Aladdins on their journey of discovery.

A son, under such influence, broke open the desk of an avaricious father, who caught him in the act, and nearly shot him in a fit of rage. One of the keys of Occultism is in the hands of science—cold, heartless, materialistic, and crassly ignorant of the other truly psychic side of the phenomenon: hence, powerless to draw a line of demarcation between the physiological and the purely spiritual effects of the disease inoculated, and unable to prevent future results and consequences of which it has no knowledge, and over which it has, therefore, no control. We find in Le Lotus of September, 1887, the following: A French paper, the Paris, for August 12th, contains a long and excellent article by G. Montorgueil, entitled, “The Accursed Sciences,” from which we extract the following passage, since we are, unfortunately, unable to quote the whole:— “Some months ago, already, in I forget what case, the question of ‘suggestion’ was raised and taken account of by the judges. We shall certainly see people in the dock accused of occult malpractices. But how will the prosecution go to work? What arguments wilt it bring to bear? The crime by ‘suggestion’ is the ideal of a crime without proof. In such a case the gravest charges will never be more than presumptions, and fugitive presumptions. On what fragile scaffolding of suspicions will the charge rest? No examination, but a moral one, will be possible. We shall have to resign ourselves to hearing the Solicitor-general say to the accused: ’Accused, it appears from a perquisition made into your brain, etc.’ Ah, the poor jurymen! it is they who are to be pitied. Taking their task to heart, they already have the greatest difficulty in separating the true from the false, even in rough and ready cases, the facts of which are obvious, all the details of which are tangible and the responsibilities clear. And we are going to ask them on their soul and conscience to decide questions of black magic! Verily their reason will not hold out through the fortnight; it will give way before that and sink into thaumaturgy. We move fast. The strange trials for sorcery will blossom anew; somnambules who were merely grotesque will appear in a tragic light; the coffee grounds, which so far only risked the police court, will hear their sentence at the assizes.

As Grandier had made for himself many enemies both by his unusual brilliancy as a writer and preacher, and by his somewhat careless way of living, it became an easy task to charge him with having bewitched the young women. The first trial held on orders of the Bishop of Poictiers came to naught, on account of many contradictions in the evidence brought forward. Through the efforts of Cardinal de Richelieu, however, who appears to have had an old grudge against Grandier, another trial was ordered, with Laubardemont in charge. Grandier steadfastly refused to confess the crimes he was accused of having perpetrated. He was found guilty and burnt alive on August 18, 1634.

Thus Liébeault found only sixty subjects intractable o u t of the seven hundred he experimented upon; and Bernheim, out of 1,014 subjects, failed with only twenty-six. The field for the natural-born jadoo-wala (sorcery-mongers), is vast indeed! Evil has acquired a play-ground on which it may now exercise its sway upon many a generation of unconscious victims. For crimes undreamt of in the waking state, and felonies of the blackest dye, are now invited and encouraged by the new “accursed science.” The real perpetrators of these deeds of darkness may now remain for ever hidden from the vengeance of human justice. The hand which executes the criminal suggestion is only that of an irresponsible automaton, whose memory preserves no trace of it, and who, moreover, is a witness who can easily be disposed of by compulsory suicide—again under “suggestion.” What better means than these could be offered to the fiends of lust and"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"revenge, to those dark Powers—called human passions—ever on the lookout to break the universal commandment: “Thou shalt not steal, nor murder, nor lust after thy neighbour’s wife?” Liébeault suggested to a young girl that she should poison herself with prussic acid, and she swallowed the supposed drug without one moment’s hesitation; Dr. J. Liégeois suggested to a young woman that she owed him 5,000 francs, and the subject forthwith signed a cheque for the amount. Bernheim suggested to another hysterical girl a long and complicated vision with regard to a criminal case. Two days after, although the hypnotiser had not exercised any new pressure upon her in the interim, she repeated distinctly the whole suggested story to a lawyer sent to her for the purpose. Had her evidence been seriously accepted, it would have brought the accused to the guillotine. These cases present two dark and terrible aspects. From the moral standpoint, such processes and suggestions 106   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS leave an indelible stain upon t he purity of the subject’s nature. Even the innocent mind of a ten year old child can thus be in o culated with vice, the poison-germ of which will develop in his subsequent life. On the judicial aspect it is needless to enter in great detail. Suffice to say that it is this characteristic feature of the hypnotic state—the absolute surrender of will and self-consciousness to the hypnotiser—which possesses such importance, from its bearing upon crime, in the eyes of legal authorities. For if the hypnotiser has the subject entirely at his beck and call, so that he can cause him to commit any crime, acting, so to say, invisibly within him, then what are not the terrible “judicial mistakes” to be expected? What wonder then, that the jurisprudence of one country after the other has taken alarm, and is devising, one after the other, measures for repressing the exercise of hypnotism! In Denmark it has just been forbidden. Scientists have experimented upon sensitives with so much success that a hypnotised victim has been jeered and hooted through the streets on his way to commit a crime, which he would have completed unconsciously, had not the victim been warned beforehand by the hypnotiser. In Brussels a recent and sad case is well-known to all. A young girl of good family was seduced while in a hypnotised state by a man who had first subjected her to his influence at a social gathering. She only realised her condition a few months later, when her relatives, who divined the criminal, forced her seducer to make the only possible reparation—that of marrying his victim. The French Academy has just been debating the question:—how far a hypnotised subject, from a mere victim, can become a regular tool of crime. Of course, no jurist or legislator can remain indifferent to this question; and it was averred that the crimes committed under suggestion are so unprecedented that some of them can hardly be brought within the scope of the law. Hence the prudent legal prohibition, just adopted in France, which enacts that no person, save those legally qualified to exercise the medical profession, shall hypnotise"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" T HE S IGNS OF THE T IMES  107 any other person. Even the physic ian who enjoys such legal right is permitted to hypnotise a person only in the presence of a nother qualified medical man, and with the written permission of the subject. Public séances of hypnotism are forbidden, and they are strictly confined to medical cliniques and laboratories. Those who break this law are liable to a heavy fine and imprisonment. But the keynote has been struck, and many are the ways in which this black art may be used—laws notwithstanding. That it will be so used, the vile passions inherent in human nature are sufficient guarantee. Many and strange will be the romances yet enacted; for truth is often stranger than fiction, and what is thought fiction is still more often truth. No wonder then that occult literature is growing with every day. Occultism and sorcery are in the air, with no true philosophical knowledge to guide the experimenters and thus check evil results. “Works of f i ction ,” the various novels and romances are called. “Fiction” in the arrangement of their characters and the adventures of their heroes and heroines—admitted. Not so, as to the facts presented. These are no fictions, but true presentiments of what lies in the bosom of the future, and much of which is already born—nay corroborated by scientific experiments. Signs of the times! Close of a psychic cycle! The time for phenomena with, or through mediums, whether professional or otherwise, is gone by. It was the early season of the blossoming, of the era mentioned even in the Bible;* the tree of Occultism is now preparing for “fruiting,” and the Spirit of the Occult is awakening in the blood of the new generations.

The third and most important is an indomitable determination to obtain and face that knowledge.

Desire, in its widest application, is the one creative force in the Universe. In this sense it is indistinguishable from Will; but we men never know desire under this form while we remain only men. Therefore Will and Desire are here considered as opposed. Thus Will is the offspring of the Divine, the God in man; Desire the motive power of the animal life. Most of men live in and by desire, mistaking it for will. But he who would achieve must separate will from desire, and make his will the ruler; for desire is unstable and ever changing, while will is steady and constant. Both will and desire are absolute creators, forming the man himself and his surroundings. But will creates intelligently—desire blindly and unconsciously. The man, therefore, makes himself in the image of his desires, unless he creates himself in the likeness of the Divine, through his will, the child of the light. His task is twofold: to awaken the will, to strengthen it by use and conquest, to make it absolute ruler within his body; and, parallel with this, to purify desire.

Ancient wisdom alone solves the presence of the universal fiend in a satisfactory way It attributes the birth of Kosmos and the evolution of life to the breaking asunder of primordial, manifested U NITY , into plurality, or the great illusion of form. H OMOGENEITY having transformed itself into Heterogeneity, contrasts have n aturally been created: hence sprang what we call E VIL , which thenceforward reigned su preme in this “Vale of Tears.” Materialistic Western philosophy (so mis-named) has not failed to profit by this grand metaphysical tenet Even physical Science, with Chemistry at its head, has turned its attention of late to the first proposition, and directs its efforts toward proving on irrefutable data the homogeneity of primordial matter. But now steps in materialistic Pessimism, a teaching which is neither philosophy nor science, but only a deluge of meaningless words. Pessimism, in its latest development, having ceased to be pantheistic, and having wedded itself to materialism, prepares to make capital out of the old Indian formula. But the atheistic pessimist soars no higher than the terrestrial homogeneous plasm of the Darwinists. For him the ultima thule is earth and matter, and he sees, beyond the prima materia, only an ugly void, an empty nothingness. Some of the pessimists attempt to poetize their idea after the manner of the whited sepulchres, or the Mexican corpses, whose ghastly cheeks and lips are thickly covered with rouge. The decay of matter pierces through the mask of seeming life, all efforts to the contrary notwithstanding. Materialism patronises Indian metaphors and imagery now. In a new work upon the subject by Dr. Mainlander, Pessimism and Progress, one learns that Indian Pantheism and German Pessimism are identical; and that it is the T HE O RIGIN OF E VIL  111 breaking up of homogeneous ma t ter into heterogeneous material, the transition from uniformity to multiformity, wh i ch resulted in so unhappy a universe. Saith Pessimism:— This (transition) is precisely the original mistake, the primordial sin, which the whole cre ation has now to expiate by heavy suffering; it is just that sin, which, having launched into existence all that lives, plunged it thereby into the abysmal depths of evil and misery, to escape from which there is but one means possible, i.e., by putting an end to being itself."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"This interpretation of the Eastern formula, attributing to it the first idea of escaping the misery of life by “putting an end to being”—whether that being is viewed as applicable to the whole Kosmos, or only to individual life—is a gross misconception. The Eastern pantheist, whose philosophy teaches him to discriminate between Being or E SSE and conditioned existence, would h a rdly indulge in so absurd an idea as the postulation of such an alternative. He knows he can put an end to form alone, not to being— and that only on this plane of terrestrial illusion. True, he knows that by killing out in himself Tanha (the unsatisfied desire for existence, or the “ will to live”)—he will thus gradually escape the curse of re-birth and conditioned existence. But he knows also that he cannot kill or \"put an end,\" even to his own little life except as a personality, which after all is but a change of dress. And believing but in One Reality, which is eternal Be-ness, the “ causeless CAUSE ” from which he has exiled himsel f unto a world of forms, he regards the temporary and progressing manifestations of it in the state of Maya (change or illusion), as the greatest evil, truly; but at the same time as a process in nature, as unavoidable as are the pangs of birth. It is the only means by which he can pass from limited and conditioned lives of sorrow into eternal life, or into that absolute “Be-ness,” which is so graphically expressed in the Sanskrit word sat. The “Pessimism” of the Hindu or Buddhist Pantheist is metaphysical, abstruse, and philosophical. The idea that matter and its Protean manifestations are the source 112   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS and origin of universal evil an d sorrow is a very old one, though Gautama Buddha was the first to give to it its definite e xpression. But the great Indian Reformer assuredly never meant to make of it a handle for the modern pessimist to get hold of, or a peg for the materialist to hang his distorted and pernicious tenets upon! The Sage and Philosopher, who sacrificed himself for Humanity by living for it, in order to save it, by teaching men to see in the sensuous existence of matter misery alone, had never in his deep philosophical mind any idea of offering a premium for suicide; his efforts were to release mankind from too strong an attachment to life, which is the chief cause of Selfishness—whence the creator of mutual pain and suffering. In his personal case, Buddha left us an example of fortitude to follow: in living, not in running away from life. His doctrine shows evil immanent, not in matter which is eternal, but in the illusions created by it: through the changes and transformations of matter generating life—because these changes are conditioned and such life is ephemeral. At the same time those evils are shown to be not only unavoidable, but necessary. For if we would discern good from evil, light from darkness, and appreciate the former, we can do so only through the contrasts between the two While Buddha’s philosophy points, in its dead-letter meaning, only to the dark side of things on this illusive plane; its esotericism, the hidden soul of it, draws the veil aside and reveals to the Arhat all the glories of LIFE ETERNAL in all the Homogeneousness of Consciousness and Being. Anoth e r absurdity, no doubt, in the eyes of materialistic science and even modern Idealism, yet a fact to the Sage and esoteric Pantheist. Nevertheless, the root idea that evil is born and generated by the ever increasing"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"complications of the homogeneous material, which enters into form and differentiates more and more as that form becomes physically more perfect, has an esoteric side to it which seems to have never occurred to the modern pessimist. Its dead-letter aspect, however, became the subject of speculation with every ancient thinking nation. Even in India the T HE O RIGIN OF E VIL  113 primitive thought, underlyin g the formula already cited, has been disfigured by Sectarianism, and has led to the r itualistic, purely dogmatic observances of the Hatha Yogis, in contradistinction to the philosophical Vedantic Raja Yoga. Pagan and Christian exoteric speculation, and even mediaeval monastic asceticism, have extracted all they could from the originally noble idea, and made it subservient to their narrow-minded sectarian views. Their false conceptions of matter have led the Christians from the earliest day to identify woman with Evil and matter—notwithstanding the worship paid by the Roman Catholic Church to the Virgin. But the latest application of the misunderstood Indian formula by the Pessimists in Germany is quite original, and rather unexpected, as we shall see. To draw any analogy between a highly metaphysical teaching, and Darwin’s theory of physical evolution would, in itself, seem rather a hopeless task. The more so as the theory of natural selection does not preach any conceivable extermination of being, but, on the contrary, a continuous and ever increasing development of life. Nevertheless, German ingenuity has contrived, by means of scientific paradoxes and much sophistry, to give it a semblance of philosophical truth. The old Indian tenet itself has not escaped litigation at the hands of modern pessimism. The happy discoverer of the theory, that the origin of evil dates from the protoplasmic Amoeba, which divided itself for procreation, and thus lost its immaculate homogeneity, has laid claim to the Aryan archaic formula in his new volume. While extolling its philosophy and the depth of ancient conceptions, he declares that it ought to be viewed “as the most profound truth precogitated and robbed by the ancient sages from modern thought”!! It thus follows that the deeply religious Pantheism of the Hindu and Buddhist philosopher, and the occasional vagaries of the pessimistic materialist, are placed on the same level and identified by “modern thought.” The impassable chasm between the two is ignored. It matters little, it seems, that the Pantheist, recognising no reality 114   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS in the manifested Kosmos, and r e garding it as a simple illusion of his senses, has to view his own existence also as only a b undle of illusions. When, therefore, he speaks of the means of escaping from the sufferings of objective life, his view of those sufferings, and his motive for putting an end to existence are entirely different from those of the pessimistic materialist. For him, pain as well as sorrow are illusions, due to attachment to"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"this life, and ignorance. Therefore he strives after eternal, changeless life, and absolute consciousness in the state of Nirvana; whereas the European pessimist, taking the “evils” of life as realities, aspires when he has the time to aspire after anything except those said mundane realities, to annihilation of “being,” as he expresses it. For the philosopher there is but one real life, Nirvanic bliss, which is a state differing in kind, not in degree only, from that of any of the planes of consciousness in the manifested universe. The Pessimist calls “Nirvana” superstition, and explains it as “cessation of life,” life for him beginning and ending on earth. The former ignores in his spiritual aspirations even the integral homogeneous unit, of which the German Pessimist now makes such capital. He knows of, and believes in, only the direct cause of that unit, eternal and ever living, because the ONE uncreated, or rather not evoluted. Hence all his efforts are directed toward the speediest reunion possible with, and return to his pre -primordial condition, after his pilgrimage through this illusive series of visionary lives, with their unreal phantasmagoria of sensuous perceptions. Such pantheism can be qualified as “pessimistic” only by a believer in a personal Providence; by one who contrasts its negation of the reality of anything “created” — i.e. , conditioned and limited—with his own blind and unphilosophical faith. The Oriental mind does not busy itself with extracting evil from every radical law and manifestation of life, and multiplying every phenomenal quantity by the units of very often imaginary evils: the Eastern Pantheist simply submits to the inevitable, and tries to blot out from his path in life as many “descents T HE O RIGIN OF E VIL   115 into rebirth” as he can, by avoi d ing the creation of new Karmic causes. The Buddhist philosopher knows that the dur a tion of the series of lives of every human being—unless he reaches Nirvana “artificially” (“takes the kingdom of God by violence,” in Kabalistic parlance), is given, allegorically, in the forty-nine days passed by Gautama the Buddha under the Bo-tree. And the Hindu sage is aware, in his turn, that he has to light the first, and extinguish the forty-ninth fire * before he reaches his final deliverance. Knowing this, both sage and philosopher wait patiently for the natural hour of deliverance; whereas their unlucky copyist, the European Pessimist, is ever ready to commit, as to preach, suicide. Ignorant of the numberless heads of the hydra of existences he is incapable of feeling the same philosophical scorn for life as he does for death, and of, thereby, following the wise example given him by his Oriental brother. Thus, philosophical pantheism is very different from modern pessimism. The first is based upon the correct understanding of the mysteries of being; the latter is in reality only one more system of evil added by unhealthy fancy to the already large sum of real social evils. In sober truth it is no philosophy, but simply a systematic slander of life and being; the bilious utterances of a dyspeptic or an incurable hypochondriac. No parallel can ever be attempted between the two systems of thought. The seeds of evil and sorrow were indeed the earliest result and consequence of the heterogeneity of the manifested universe. Still they are but an illusion produced by the law"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"of contrasts, which, as described, is a fundamental law in nature. Neither good nor evil would exist –––––––––– * This is an esoteric tenet, and the general reader will not make much out of it. But the Theosophist who has read Esoteric Buddhism may compute the 7 by 7 of the forty-nine “days,\" and the forty-nine “fires,\" and understand that the allegory refers esoterically to the seven human consecutive root-races with their seven subdivisions.

Only a “Buddha\" is shown reaching it during the course of one life. –––––––––– 116  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS were it not for the light they m u tually throw on each other. Being, under whatever form, having been observed from the W o rld’s creation to offer these contrasts, and evil predominating in the universe owing to Ego -ship or selfishness, the rich Oriental metaphor has pointed to existence as expiating the mistake of nature; and the human soul (psyche), was henceforth regarded as the scapegoat and victim of unconscious O VER -S OUL . But it is not to Pessimism, but to Wisdom t h at it gave birth. Ignorance alone is the willing martyr, but knowledge is the master of natural Pessimism. Gradually, and by the process of heredity or atavism, the latter became innate in man. It is always present in us, howsoever latent and silent its voice in the beginning. Amid the early joys of existence, when we are still full of the vital energies of youth, we are yet apt, each of us, at the first pang of sorrow, after a failure, or at the sudden appearance of a black cloud, to accuse life of it; to feel life a burden, and often to curse our being. This shows pessimism in our blood, but at the same time the presence of the fruits of ignorance. As mankind multiplies, and with it suffering—which is the natural result of an increasing number of units that generate it—sorrow and pain are intensified. We live in an atmosphere of gloom and despair, but this is because our eyes are downcast and rivetted to the earth, with all its physical and grossly material manifestations. If, instead of that, man proceeding on his life-journey looked—not heavenward, which is but a figure of speech—but within himself and centred his point of observation on the inner man, he would soon escape from the coils of the great serpent of illusion. From the cradle to the grave, his life would then become supportable and worth living, even in its worst phases. Pessimism—that chronic suspicion of lurking evil everywhere—is thus of a two-fold nature, and brings fruits of two kinds. It is a natural characteristic in physical man, and becomes a curse only to the ignorant. It is a boon to the spiritual; inasmuch as it makes the latter turn into the right path, and brings him to the discovery of another as fundamental a truth; namely, that all in this T HE O RIGIN OF E VIL   117 "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"world is only preparatory because transitory. It is like a chink in the dark prison walls of earth-life, through which breaks in a ray of light from the eternal home, which, illuminating the inner senses, whispers to the prisoner in his shell of clay of the origin and the dual mystery of our being. At the same time, it is a tacit proof of the presence in man of that which knows, without being told, viz.:— that there is another and a better life, once that the curse of earth-lives is lived through. This explanation of the problem and origin of evil being, as already said, of an entirely metaphysical character, has nothing to do with physical laws. Belonging as it does altogether to the spiritual part of man, to dabble with it superficially is, therefore, far more dangerous than to remain ignorant of it. For, as it lies at the very root of Gautama Buddha’s ethics, and since it has now fallen into the hands of the modern Philistines of materialism, to confuse the two systems of “pessimistic” thought can lead but to mental suicide, if it does not lead to worse. Eastern wisdom teaches that spirit has to pass through the ordeal of incarnation and life, and be baptised with matter before it can reach experience and knowledge. After which only it receives the baptism of soul, or self-consciousness, and may return to its original condition of a god, plus experience, ending with omniscience. In other words, it can return to the original state of homogeneity of primordial essence only through the addition of the fruitage of Karma, which alone is able to create an absolute conscious deity, removed but one degree from the absolute A LL . Ev e n a c c o r d i n g t o t h e l e t t e r o f t h e Bible, evil must have existed before Adam and Eve, who, therefore, are innocent of the slander of the original sin. For, had there been no evil or sin before them, there could exist neither tempting Serpent nor a Tree of Knowledge of good and evil in Eden. The characteristics of that apple-tree are shown in the verse when the couple had tasted of its fruit: “The eyes of them both were opened, and they knew ” many things besides knowing they were naked. 118   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS Too much knowledge about things of matter is thus rightly shown an evil. But so it is, and it is our duty to e x amine and combat the new pernicious theory. Hitherto, pessimism was kept in the regions of philosophy and metaphysics, and showed no pretensions to intrude into the domain of purely physical science, such as Darwinism. The theory of evolution has become almost universal now, and there is no school (save the Sunday and missionary schools) where it is not taught, with more or less modifications from the original programme. On the other hand, there is no other teaching more abused and taken advantage of than evolution, especially by the application of its fundamental laws to the solution of the most compound and abstract problems of man’s many-sided existence. There, where psychology and even philosophy “fear to tread,” materialistic biology applies its sledge-hammer of superficial analogies, and prejudged conclusions. Worse than all, claiming man to be only a higher animal, it maintains this right as undeniably pertaining to the domain of the science of evolution. Paradoxes in those “domains” do not rain now, they pour. As “man is the measure of all things,” therefore is"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"man measured and analyzed by the animal. One German materialist claims spiritual and psychic evolution as the lawful property of physiology and biology; the mysteries of embryology and zoology alone, it is said, being capable of solving those of consciousness in man and the origin of his soul.* Another finds justification for suicide in the example of animals, who, when tired of living, put an end to existence by starvation.† Hitherto pessimism, notwithstanding the abundance and brilliancy of its paradoxes, had a weak point—namely, the absence of any real and evident basis for it to rest upon. Its followers had no living, guiding thought to serve them as a beacon and help them to steer clear –––––––––– * Haeckel. † Leo Bach . –––––––––– T HE O RIGIN O F E VIL  119 of the sandbanks of life—real a nd imaginary—so profusely sown by themselves in the shape of denunciations agains t life and being. All they could do was to rely upon their representatives, who occupied their time very ingeniously if not profitably, in tacking the many and various evils of life to the metaphysical propositions of great German thinkers, like Schopenhauer and Hartmann, as small boys tack coloured tails to the kites of their elders and rejoice at seeing them launched in the air. But now the programme will be changed. The Pessimists have found something more solid and authoritative, if less philosophical, to tack their jeremiads and dirges to, than the metaphysical kites of Schopenhauer. The day when they agreed with the views of this philosopher, which pointed at the Universal W ILL as the perpetrator of all the World-evil, is gone to return no more. Nor will they be any better satisfied with the hazy “Unconscious” of von Hartmann. They have been seeking diligent l y for a more congenial and less metaphysical soil to build their pessimistic philosophy upon, and they have been rewarded with success, now that the cause of Universal Suffering has been discovered by them in the fundamental laws of physical development. Evil will no longer be allied with the misty and uncertain Phantom called “W ILL ,” but with an actual and obvious fact: the Pessimists will henceforth be towed by the Evolutionists. The ba s ic argument of their representative has been given in the opening sentence of this article. The Universe and all on it appeared in consequence of the “breaking asunder of U NITY into Plurality ” This rather dim rendering of th e Indian formula is not made to refer, as I have shown, in the mind of the Pessimist, to the one Unity, to the Vedantin abstraction—Parabrahm: otherwise, I should not certainly have used the words “breaking up.” Nor does it concern itself much with Mulaprakriti, or the “Veil” of Parabrahm; nor even with the first manifested primordial matter, except inferentially, as follows from Dr. Mainlander’s exposition, but chiefly with terrestrial protoplasm. Spirit of deity is entirely ignored in this case; evidently because of the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 120  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS necessity for showing the whol e as “the lawful domain of physical Science.” In short, the time-honoured for m ula is claimed to have its basis and to find its justification in the theory that from “a few, perhaps one, single form of the very simplest nature” (Darwin), “all the different animals and plants living to-day, and all the organisms that have ever lived on the earth,” have gradually developed. It is this axiom of Science, we are told, which justifies and demonstrates the Hindu philosophical tenet. What is this axiom? Why, it is this: Science teaches that the series of transformations through which the seed is made to pass—the seed that grows into a tree, or becomes an ovum , or that which develops into an animal—consists in every case in nothing but the passage of the fabric of that seed, from the homogeneous into the heterogeneous or compound form. This is then the scientific verity which checks the Indian formula by that of the Evolutionists, identifies both, and thus exalts ancient wisdom by recognizing it worthy of modern materialistic thought. This philosophical formula is not simply corroborated by the individual growth and development of isolated species, explains our Pessimist; but it is demonstrated in general as in detail. It is shown justified in the evolution and growth of the Universe as well as in that of our planet. In short, the birth, growth and development of the whole organic world in its integral totality, are there to demonstrate ancient wisdom. From the universals down to the particulars, the organic world is discovered to be subject to the same law of ever increasing elaboration, of the transition from unity to plurality as “the fundamental formula of the evolution of life.” Even the growth of nations, of social life, public institutions, the development of the languages, arts and sciences, all this follows inevitably and fatally the all-embracing law of “the breaking asunder of unity into plurality, and the passage of the homogeneous into multiformity.” But while following Indian wisdom, our author exaggerates this fundamental law in his own way, and distorts it. He brings this law to bear even on the T HE O RIGIN OF E VIL  121 historical destinies of mank i nd. He makes these destinies subservient to, and a proof of, the correctness of the Indian conc e ption. He maintains that humanity as an integral whole, in proportion as it develops and progresses in its evolution, and separates in its parts each becoming a distinct and independent branch of the unit—drifts more and more away from its original healthy, harmonious unity. The complications of social establishment, social relations, as those of individuality, all lead to the weakening of the vital power, the relaxation of the energy of feeling, and to the destruction of that integral unity, without which no inner harmony is possible. The absence of that harmony generates an inner discord which becomes the cause of the greatest mental misery. Evil has its roots in the very nature of the evolution of life and its complications. Every one of its steps forward is"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"at the same time a step taken toward the dissolution of its energy, and leads to passive apathy. Such is the inevitable result, he says, of every progressive complication of life; because evolution or development is a transition from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, a scattering of the whole into the many, etc., etc. This terrible law is universal and applies to all creation, from the infinitesimally small up to man for, as he says, it is a fundamental law of nature. Now, it is just in this one-sided view of physical nature, which the German author accepts without one single thought as to its spiritual and psychic aspect, that his school is doomed to certain failure. It is not a question whether the said law of differentiation and its fatal consequences may or may not apply, in certain cases, to the growth and development of the animal species, and even of man; but simply, since it is the basis and main support of the whole new theory of the Pessimistic school, whether it is really a universal and fundamental law? We want to know whether this basic formula of evolution embraces the whole process of development and growth in its entirety; and whether, indeed, it is within the domain of physical science or not. If it is “nothing else than the transition from the homogeneous state to the heterogeneous,” 1 2 2   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS as says Mainländer, than it rema ins to be proved that the given process “produces that complicated combination of ti s sues and organs which forms and completes the perfect animal and plant.” As remarked already by some critics on Pessimism and Progress, the German Pessimist does not doubt it for one moment. His supposed discovery and teaching “rest wholly on his certitude that development and the fundamental law of the complicated process of organization represent but one thing: the transformation of unity into plurality.” Hence the identification of the process with dissolution and decay, and the weakening of all the forces and energies. Mainländer would be right in his analogies were this law of the differentiation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous to really represent the fundamental law of the evolution of life. But the idea is quite erroneous—metaphysically as well as physically. Evolution does not proceed in a straight line; no more than any other process in nature, but journeys on cyclically, as does all the rest. The cyclic serpents swallow their tails like the Serpent of Eternity. And it is in this that the Indian formula, which is a Secret Doctrine teaching, is indeed corroborated by the natural Sciences, and especially by biology. This is what we read in the “Scientific Letters” by an anonymous Russian author and critic. In the evolution of isolated individuals, in the evolution of the organic world, in that of the Universe, as in th e g r o w th a n d d e v e lo p m e n t o f our planet—in short wherever any of the processes of progressive complexity take place, there we find, apart from the transition from unity to plurality, and homogeneity to heterogeneity a converse transformation—the transition from plurality to unity , from the heterogeneous to the homogeneous. . . . Minute observation of the given process of progressive complexity has shown, that what takes place in it is not alone the separation of parts, but also their mutual absorption. . . . . While one portion of the cells merge into each other and unite into one uniform whole, forming muscular fibres,"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"muscular tissue, others are absorbed in the bone and nerve tissues, etc., etc. The same takes place in the formation of plants. . . . . In this case material nature repeats the law that acts in the evolution of the psychic and the spiritual: both T HE O RIGIN O F E VIL  123 descend but to re-ascend and m e rge at the starting-point. The homogeneous formative mass or element differentiated in its parts is gradually transformed into the heterogeneous; then, merging those parts into a harmonious whole, it recommences a converse process, or reinvolution, and returns as gradually into its primitive or primordial state. Nor does Pessimism find any better support in pure Materialism, as hitherto the latter has been tinged with a decidedl y optimistic bias. Its leading advocates have, indeed, never hesitated to sneer at the theological adoration of the “glory of God and all his works.” Büchner flings a taunt at the pantheist who sees in so “mad and bad” a world the manifestation of the Absolute. But, on the whole, the materialists admit a balance of good over evil, perhaps as a buffer against any “superstitious” tendency to look out and hope for a better one. Narrow as is their outlook, and limited as is their spiritual horizon, they yet see no cause to despair of the drift of things in general. The pantheistic pessimists, however, have never ceased to urge that a despair of conscious being is the only legitimate outcome of atheistic negation. This opinion is, of course, axiomatic, or ought to be so. If “in this life only is there hope,” the tragedy of life is absolutely without any raison d ’ être and a perpetuation of the drama is as foolish as it is futile. The fact that the conclusions of pessimism have been at last assimilated by a certain class of atheistic writers, is a striking feature of the day, and another sign of the times. It illustrates the truism that the void created by modern scientific negation cannot and can never be filled by the cold prospects offered as a solatium to optimists. The Comtean “enthusiasm of Humanity” is a poor thing enough with annihilation of the Race to ensue “as the solar fires die slowly out”—if, indeed, they do die at all—to please physical science at the computed time. If all present sorrow and suffering, the fierce struggle for existence and all its attendant horrors, go for nothing in the long run, if M AN is a mere ephemeron, t h e s p o r t o f b l i n d f o r c e s , w h y a s s ist in the perpetuation of the farce?

Terrestrial life is no object in itself. It is overcast with gloom and misery. It does not seem strange, then, that the Soul-blind negationist should prefer the pessimism of Schopenhauer to the baseless optimism of Strauss and his followers, which, in the face of"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"their teachings, reminds one of the animal spirits of a young donkey, after a good meal of thistles. One thing is, however, clear: the absolute necessity for some solution, which embraces the facts of existence on an optimistic basis. Modern Society is permeated with an increasing cynicism and honeycombed with disgust of life. This is the result of an utter ignorance of the operations of Karma and the nature of Soul-evolution. It is from a mistaken allegiance to the dogmas of a mechanical and largely spurious theory of Evolution, that Pessimism has risen to such undue importance. Once the basis of the Great Law is grasped—and what philosophy can furnish better means for such a grasp and final solution, than the esoteric doctrine of the great Indian Sages—there remains no possible locus standi for the recent amendments to the Schopenhauerian system of thought or the metaphysical subtleties, woven by the “philosopher of the Unconscious.” The reasonableness of Conscious Existence can be proved only by the study of the primeval—now esoteric—philosophy. And it says “there is neither death nor life, for both are illusions; being (or be-ness ) is the only reality.” This paradox was repeated thousands of ages later by one of the greatest physiologists that ever lived. “Life is Death” said Claude Bernard. The organism lives because its parts are ever dying. The survival of the fittest is surely based on this truism.

Nay more, it would seem to penetrate deep into the hear t of things, and thus to be inseparable from any attempt to put into words the truth, the reality which underlies the outward shows of life. And the paradox is one not in words only, but in action, in the very conduct of life. The paradoxes of occultism must be lived, not uttered only. Herein lies a great danger, for it is only too easy to become lost in the intellectual contemplation of the path, and so to forget that the road can only be known by treading it. 126   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS One startling paradox meets th e student at the very outset, and confronts him in ever new and strange shapes at each t u rn of the road. Such an one, perchance, has sought the path desiring a guide, a rule of right for the conduct of his life. He learns that the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end of life is selflessness; and he feels the truth of the saying that only in the profound unconsciousness of self-forgetfulness can the truth and reality of being reveal itself to his eager heart. The student learns that this is the one law of occultism, at once the science and the art of living, the guide to the goal he desires to attain. He is fired with enthusiasm and enters bravely on the mountain track. He then finds that his teachers do not encourage his ardent flights of sentiment; his all-forgetting yearning for the Infinite—on the outer plane of his actual life and consciousness. At least, if they do not actually damp his enthusiasm, they set him, as the first and indispensable task, to conquer and control his body. The student finds that far from being encouraged to live in the soaring thoughts of his brain, and to fancy he has reached that ether where is true freedom—to the forgetting of his body, and his external actions and personality—he is set down to tasks much nearer earth. All his attention and watchfulness are required on the outer plane; he must never forget himself, never lose hold over his body, his mind, his brain. He must even learn to control the expression of every feature, to check the action of each muscle, to be master of every slightest involuntary movement. The daily life around and within him is pointed out as the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"object of his study and observation. Instead of forgetting what are usually called the petty trifles, the little forgetfulness, the accidental slips of tongue or memory, he is forced to become each day more conscious of these lapses, till at last they seem to poison the air he breathes and stifle him, till he seems to lose sight and touch of the great world of freedom towards which he is struggling, till every hour of every day seems full of the bitter taste of self, and his heart grows sick with pain and the struggle of despair. And the darkness is rendered yet deeper by the voice within T HE G REAT P ARADOX  127 him, crying ceaselessly, \"forg e t thyself. Beware, lest thou becomest self-concentrated—and the giant weed of spiritual self ishness take firm root in thy heart; beware, beware, beware!\" The voice stirs his heart to its depths, for he feels that the words are true. His daily and hourly battle is teaching him that self-centredness is the root of misery, the cause of pain, and his soul is full of longing to be free. Thus the disciple is torn by doubt. He trusts his teachers, for he knows that through them speaks the same voice he hears in the silence of his own heart. But now they utter contradictory words; the one, the inner voice, bidding him forget himself utterly in the service of humanity; the other, the spoken word of those from whom he seeks guidance in his service, bidding him first to conquer his body, his outer self. And he knows better with every hour how badly he acquits himself in that battle with the Hydra, and he sees seven heads grow afresh in place of each one that he has lopped off. At first he oscillates between the two, now obeying the one, now the other. But soon he learns that this is fruitless. For the sense of freedom and lightness, which comes at first when he leaves his outer self unwatched, that he may seek the inner air, soon loses its keenness, and some sudden shock reveals to him that he has slipped and fallen on the uphill path. Then, in desperation, he flings himself upon the treacherous snake of self, and strives to choke it into death; but its ever-moving coils elude his grasp, the insidious temptations of its glittering scales blind his vision, and again he becomes involved in the turmoil of the battle, which gains on him from day to day, and which at last seems to fill the whole world, and blot out all else beside from his consciousness. He is face to face with a crushing paradox, the solution of which must be lived before it can be really understood. In his hours of silent meditation the student will find that there is one space of silence within him where he can find refuge from thoughts and desires, from the turmoil of the senses and the delusions of the mind. By sinking his consciousness deep into his heart he can 128   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS reach this place—at first onl y when he is alone in silence and darkness. But when the need"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"for the silence has grown great enough, he will turn to seek it even in the midst of the struggle with self, and he will find it. Only he must not let go of his outer self, or his body; he must learn to retire into this citadel when the battle grows fierce, but to do so without losing sight of the battle; without allowing himself to fancy that by so doing he has won the victory. That victory is won only when all is silence without as within the inner citadel. Fighting thus, from within that silence, the student will find that he has solved the first great paradox. But paradox still follows him. When first he thus succeeds in thus retreating into himself, he seeks there only for refuge from the storm in his heart. And as he struggles to control the gusts of passion and desire, he realises more fully what mighty powers he has vowed himself to conquer. He still feels himself, apart from the silence, nearer akin to the forces of the storm. How can his puny strength cope with these tyrants of animal nature? This question is hard to answer in direct words; if, indeed, such an answer can be given. But analogy may point the way where the solution may be sought. In breathing we take a certain quantity of air into the lungs, and with this we can imitate in miniature the mighty wind of heaven. We can produce a feeble semblance of nature: a tempest in a tea-cup, a gale to blow and even swamp a paper boat. And we can say: “I do this; it is my breath.” But we cannot blow our breath against a hurricane, still less hold the trade winds in our lungs. Yet the powers of heaven are within us; the nature of the intelligences which guide the world-force is blended with our own, and could we realise this and forget our outer selves, the very winds would be our instruments. So it is in life. While a man clings to his outer self—aye, and even to any one of the forms he assumes when this “mortal coil” is cast aside—so long is he trying to blow aside a hurricane with the breath of his lungs. D ESIRE M ADE P URE   129 It is useless and idle such an e n deavour; for the great winds of life must, sooner or later, sweep him away. But if he changes h is altitude in himself , if he acts on the faith that his body, his desires, his passions, his brain, are not himself, though he has charge of them, and is responsible for them; if he tries to deal with them as parts of nature, then he may hope to become one with the great tides of being, and reach the peaceful place of safe self-forgetfulness at last. “ F AUST.” –––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME VIII October, 1887 DESIRE MADE PURE [ Lucifer, Vol. I, No. 2, October, 1887, p. 133] When desire is for the purely a bstract—when it has lost all trace or tinge of “self”—then it has become pure . Th e first step towards this purity is to kill out the desire for the things of matter, since these can only be enjoyed by the separated personality. The second is to cease from desiring for oneself even such abstractions as power, knowledge, love, happiness, or fame; for they are but selfishness after all. Life itself teaches these lessons; for all such objects of desire are found Dead Sea fruit in the moment of attainment. This much we learn from experience.

Their laughter sounded like that of the Falls of Minnehaha, and from the crevices of the rocks peeped the ugly faces of gnomes and kobolds, watching slyly the fairies. Then the dreamer asks himself a variety of questions of the most perplexing nature, except, perhaps, to the material i st, who cuts every psychological problem as Alexander cleft the Gordian knot. . . . “What is the reason that we imagine such things?” he inquires. Why do we endow “dead” things with human consciousness and with sensation? . . . . . . . . Is our consciousness merely a produ c t of the organic activity of our physical body, or is it a function of the universal life . . . . . within the body? Is our personal consciousness dependent for its existence on the existence of the physical body, and does it die with it; or is there a spiritual consciousness, belonging to a higher, immortal, and invisible self of man, temporarily connected with the organism, but which may exist independently of the latter? If such is the case, if our physical organism is merely an instrument through which our consciousness acts, then this instrument is not our real self. If this is true, then our real self is there where our consciousness exists, and may exist independently of the latter. . . . . . . Can there be any dead matter in the Universe? Is not even a stone held together by the “cohesion” of its particles, and attracted to the earth by “gravitation”? But what else is this “cohesion” and “gravitation” but energy, and what is “energy” but the soul, an anterior principle called force , which produces an outward manifestation called matter ? . . . . . . . All things possess life, all things possess soul, and there may be soul-beings . . . . . . . invisible to our physical senses, but which may be perceived by our soul. [p.19.] The arch-druid of modern Hylo-Idealism, Dr. Lewins, failing to appear to rudely shake our philosopher out of his unsc i entific thoughts, a dwarf appears in his stead. The creature, however, does not warn the dreamer, as that too -learned Idealist would. He does not tell him that he transcends “the limits of the anatomy of his conscious Ego,” since “ psychosis is now diagnosed by medico-psychological 132   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS symptomatology as vesiculo-n eurosis in activity ,” * and—as quoth the raven—“mer e ly this, and nothing more.” But being a cretin, he laughingly invites him to his “Master.” The hero follows, and finds he is brought to a “theosophical monastery,” in a hidden valley of the most gorgeous description. Therein he meets, to his surprise, with adepts of both sexes; for, as he learns later:— What has intelligence to do with the sex of the body? Where the sexual instincts end, there ends the influence of the sex. Meanwhile, he is brought into the presence of a male adept of majestic appearance, who welcomes and informs him that he is among “The Brothers of the Golden and Rosy Cross.” He is invited to remain with them for some time, and see how they live. His permanent residence with them is, however, objected to. The reasons given for it are as follows:—"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"There are still too many of the lower and animal elements adhering to your constitution. . . . . . .

The thoughts of the student are read and answered as though his mind were an opened book. A lovely garden, full of exotic plants and luxurious palm-trees, into which he is taken, striking him as something unnatural in the Tyrolean Alps; so much luxury, moreover, seeming to him to disagree with the ascetic views just expressed by the adept, he is told forthwith, in answer to his unexpressed thoughts, that the garden had been erected to make his visit an agreeable one; and that it was an illusion . “All these trees and plants . . . . require no gardeners, . . . . . . they cost us nothing but an effort of our imagination”—he learns. “Surely,” he said, “this rose cannot be an illusion . . . . or an effect of my imagination?” “No,” answered the adept . . . .“ but it is a product of the imagination of Nature, whose processes can be guided by the will of the adept. The whole world . . . . is nothing else but a world of the imagination of the Universal Mind, which is the Creator of forms. . . . . ” To exemplify the teaching, a Magnolia Tree in full blossom sixty feet high, standing at a distance, is made to look less and less dense. The green foliage fades into gray, becomes “more and more shadowy and transparent,” until “it seemed to be merely the ghost of a tree, and finally disappeared entirely from view.” Thus [continued the adept] you see that tree stood in the sphere of my mind as it stood in yours. We are a ll liv in g w ith in th e s p h e r e o f e a c h other’s mind. . . . . . . . The Adept creates his own images; the ordinary mortal lives in the products of the imagination of others, or the imagination of nature. We live in the paradise of our own soul but the spheres of our souls are not narrow. They have expanded far beyond the limits of the visible bodies, and will continue to expand until they become one with the universal Soul. . . .. . . . .

It will accompany his soul after death, because the creations are attracted to their creator. [p. 83.] Scattered hither and thither, through this little volume are pearls of wisdom. For that which is rendered in the shape o f dialogue and monologue is the fruit gathered by the author during a long research in old forgotten and mouldy MSS. of the Rosicrucians, or mediaeval alchemists, and in the worm-eaten infolio of unrecognized, yet great adepts of every age. Thus when the author approaches the subject of theosophical retreats or communities—a dream cherished by many a theosophist—he is answered by the “Adept” that “ the true ascetic is he who lives in the world, surrounded by its temptations; he in whose soul the animal elements are still active, craving for the gratification of their desires and possessing the means for such gratification, but who by the superior power of his will conquers his animal self. Having attained that state he may retire from the world. . . . He expects no future reward in heaven; for what could heaven offer him except happiness which he already possesses? He desires no other good, but to create good for the world.” . . . . Saith the Adept. If you could establish theosophical monasteries, where intellectual and spiritual development would go hand-in-hand, where a new s c ience could be taught, based upon a true knowledge of the fundamental laws of the universe, and where at the same time man would be taught how to obtain a mastery over himself, you would confer the greatest possible benefit upon the world. Such a convent would afford immense advantage for the advancement of intellectual research. . . . . . . . These convents would become centres of intelligence. . . . . . . Then, reading the student’s thoughts: You mistake [he added], it is not the want of money which prevents us to execute the idea. It is the impossibility to find the proper kin d of people to inhabit the convent after it is established. Indeed, we would be poor Alchemists if we could not produce gold in any desirable quantity . . . . . . but gold is a curse to mankind, and we do not wish to increase the curse. . . . . . . . .

Even many of your would-be Occultists . . . . . . . have taken up their investigations merely for the purpose of gratifying idle curiosity, while others desire to pry into the secrets of nature, to obtain knowledge which they desire to employ for the attainment of selfish ends.

Then another adept, looking like a monk, joined him, and drew his attention to some powders, by the fumigations of which the Elementals, or “Spirits of Nature” could be made to appear. This provoked the student’s curiosity. Sure of his invulnerability in the matter of tests and temptations, he begged to be allowed to see these creatures. . . . Suddenly the room looked dim, and the walls of the laboratory disappeared. He felt he was in the water, light as a feather, dancing on the waves, with the full moon pouring torrents of light upon the ocean, and the beautiful Isle of Ceylon appearing in the distance. The melodious sound of female voices made him espy near to where he was three beautiful female beings. The Queen of the Undines, the most lovely of the three—for these were the longed-for Elementals—entices the unwary student to her submarine palace.

In the present article I shall carry no coals to Newcastle. This means that I do not propose to teach learned Brahm i ns the mysteries of their religious philosophy, but will take for my subject a few things from the Universal Kabbala. The former—once placed upon polemical grounds—is an awkward adversary to fight. Unless one has instead of a head an encyclopaedia crammed with quotations, figures, numbers and verses scattered throughout crores of pages, such polemics will be more injurious than useful. Each of the disputants will find himself with the same number of adherents to his views as he had before, as neither will convince a single man from the party opposed to him. Repeating with Sir T. Browne that “I envy no man that knows more than myself, but pity them that know less,” I will deal now with questions I am thoroughly conversant with, and in support of which I can quote good authorities. Having studied the Kabbala, for nearer forty than thirty years, I may perhaps be allowed to regard the Zohar as a legitimate ground for me to stand upon. This, however, will be no discussion, but simply a few statements of facts. Four names and teachings from the Kabbala have been brought forward to oppose our septenary doctrine:— I. We are told that the Tetragrammaton “is in the way . . . of a final union with the Logos.” Because his mystic \"constitution, as represented by the sacred Tetragram, has not a septenary basis ” T ETRAGRAMMATON  141 II. That “it is one of the oldest d i rections of the ancient Wisdom-religion that the macrocosm * should be interpre t ed according to the plan revealed by Malkuth ” III. That ( a ) “ Shekinah is an androgyne power”; and ( b ) that she “should be accepted as a guide to the interpretation of the constitution of the microcosm.” IV. That “Its [Shekinah’s] male form is the figure of man seen on the mysterious throne in the vision of Ezekiel.” † I am afraid none of the above statements are correct. I am compelled to say that each"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"and all are entirely erroneous. My authorities for saying so, will be the three chief books of the Zohar—The Book of Concealed Mystery and the two Assemblies— the Greater and the Lesser, as also the Kabbalah Denudata of Knorr von Rosenroth,‡ the Sepher Yetzirah, with its commentaries, and the Aech Metzareph, containing a key to the Kabbalistical symbolism, and all supplemented with various codices .§ An axiom echoed from the hoariest antiquity teaches us that the first step to knowledge is to know and to confess that we are ignorant. I must have taken this step, for I fully realize how very ignorant I am in many things, and confess how little I know. Nevertheless, what I know, I do know. And perhaps, were I wiser, I ought to be glad to know so little; because if “ . . . . . ignorance is the curse of God,” –––––––––– * Just so. Malkuth is the 1 0 th Sephiroth, but as the “Bride of Microprosopus ” or Tetragrammaton, who is hexamerous— Malkuth, or the material limb, is the seventh.

I venture even to say that it is qu i te impossible, with the Zohar before one’s eye and its (just) hundred and seventy passages of references and several hundreds of comments and glosses upon the real meaning of Tetragrammaton alone. Meanwhile, as “no man knoweth all”— errare humanum est— and as none of us, so far as I know, has reached the glorified position of an omniscient Buddha or a Sankaracharya, it is but just that we should compare notes and unveil that which can be lawfully unveiled. Hence I shall endeavour to show the true nature of the “Tetragrammaton” and prove its four letters to be a mere glyph, a mask to conceal metaphysically its connection with and relation to, the supernal and the inferior worlds. I will give nothing of my own speculations or knowledge, which are my personal property, the fruitage of my studies, and with which, therefore, the public has nothing to do. I shall only show what the Tetragrammaton is said to be in the Zohar, and as explained to the writer personally by a Hebrew initiated Rabbi, in Palestine, and made very plain to every advanced Kabbalist. I. The Tetragrammaton is called in the Kabbala by various names. It is IHVH, the Microprosopus, in distinction to AHIH, the Macroprosopus. It is the LESSER FACE, a reflection (tainted with matter or Malkuth , its bride, the mother earth) of the “Vaster,”"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"rather “Limitless” Face; therefore he is the antithesis of Macroprosopus. But who, or what is Macroprosopus, itself? II. It is not “Ain-Soph” the Non-Existent, or Non-Being, no more than is Tetragrammaton; for both AHIH and IHVH are glyphs of existence, and symbols of terrestrial-androgynous, as well as male and female—life. –––––––––– * [ Henry VI , Pt.

They are reflections of the Ain-Soph, the Hebrew Parabrahman; for Ain-Soph is negative, and they, actual, positive life—therefore Maya or Illusion. This is proven clearly by their dual presence in the cross—the oldest phallic symbol, thus— as shown in The Kabbalah Unveiled, Introd., p. 31.* –––––––––– * So old and so phallic, indeed, tha t leaving the ansated cross of Egypt aside, the terra cotta discs called fusaiole , found by Schliemann in abundance under the ruins of ancient Troy, are almost all in these two forms and — the Indian Swastica and the Cross, the latter being Swastica or “Thor’s Hammer” minus its four additional angles. No need to explain that the Orientalists who are unable to soar higher than the material plane, are nevertheless right, and that they have discovered one of the secret keys (of exoteric religions, only, however) in asserting that the origin of the cross is the arani and pramantha, the stick and the perforated vessel for kindling fire of the ancient Brahmins. Prometheus stealing the sacred fire of (pro) creation to endow men with, has undeniably the origin of his name in Pramantha. The god Agni was celestial fire, only so long as he was hidden in his casket. No sooner had Matari ś wan, the Rig-Vedic aerial being, forced him out of it fo r the benefit of the consuming Bhrigus, than he became terrestrial fire, that of procreation, therefore phallic. The word matha or pramantha, we are told, has for its prefix pra, adding the idea of robbing or stealing by force to that contained in the root matha of the verb mathami , or manthnami, “to produce by friction” Hence Prometheus stealing the heavenly fire to degrade it (in one sense) on earth. He not only kindles the spark of life in the man of clay, but teaches him the mysteries of creation, which, from Kriyasakti, falls into the selfish act of procreation [ Vide supra—text ] ."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"–––––––––– 144  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS III.

Its name, the Tetragram, is composed of four letters, but what is their secret, esoteric meaning?

The first is the “supernal mother” or “the female Jehovah, as Binah ”; the other is the “inferior H ,” or the 10th Sephiroth, Malkuth, the foundation of matter. It is impossible to reveal in print the first reading, when it is written AHIH , beyond stating that exoterically it is connected w ith the “I am that I am” and with Eheieh “Absolute B E - NESS or S AT .” It can be read in twelve diff e ren t ways, each sentence being symbolized in a sign of the Zodiac. These transpositions are all made to refer to the mystery of being or existence—as an abstract conception. But IHVH, the Tetragrammaton of the formative world, and the spouse of the “Bride,” whose kingdom is Asiah or matter, though easy of explanation, is still more difficult to reveal in words, not on account of its sacredness, but rather of its indecency. I refer the reader for the plain symbolism of the four letters I, H, V, H, to Mr. J. R. Skinner’s Source of Measures , p. 10, wherein that symbolism is given. Hindus see it daily in their Lingas and Yonis. It is Jehovah-Tzabaoth, the Septenary Elohim concealed in the Holy of Holies, the Argha, or Noah’s Ark. Therefore (see Plate III in Kabb. Unv., pp. 28-29) he is the seventh Sephiroth among the “superior” septenary, as Malkuth is the seventh of the “inferior” Sephiroth.

Who is this Dragon? Is he the devil Satan, as we are taught to believe by the Church? Certainly not. He is the Dragon of Esoteric Wisdom, who objects to the child born of the “woman” (the universe), for this child is its mankind, hence ignorance and illusion. But Mikael and his angels, or Jehovah-Tzabaoth (the “Host”) who refused to create as the seven passionless, mind-born, sons of Brahma did, because they aspire to incarnate as men in order to become higher than the gods —fight the Dragon, conquer him, and the child of matter is born.

The “woman” is crowned with 12 stars and has the sun and moon to clothe her (twice seven), she being the universe; the Dragon has seven heads, seven crowns and ten horns—another occult symbolism, and he is one of the seven LOGOI.

Indeed, a Prajapati and a great Vedic Rishi, and yet one who is ever interfering with the physical procreation of men, he seduces twice the thousands of Daksha’s sons into r emaining celibates and Yogis, for this he is cursed to be incarnated, born in a womb, and those who know something about numbers and cycles will now understand better the meaning of this allegory. ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME VIII T ETRAGRAMMATON  149 Therefore, though I do not feel the slightest objection to any mystic willing to unite himself with the Logos called “Te t ragrammaton” or Microprosopus, I personally prefer a union with Macroprosopus, on general principles; at any rate in this cycle of incarnation.

I, 16), all things being synthesized by Malkuth—the Seventh—Microprosopus. Microprosopus is formed of the six Sephiroth, three male and three female. The limbs of the Tetragrammaton are called the six members of Microprosopus, and 6 is the numerical value of V (Vau), his letter. When they (the limbs) touch the earth, they become seven (Introd., p. 32, Kab. Unv., and verse 9 of Comm. xxii, in Book of Numbers ) . The whole Book of Concealed Mystery is full of such sentences. “The Microprosopus is six -fold. . . . As he is formed of six Sephiroth which are called with Malkuth the inferior seven.

For, it is written in the Greater Holy Assembly— (Chap. VII, 83) “And concerning this the children of Israel wished to inquire in their hearts, like as it is written, Exodus, xvii, 7, ‘Is the Tetragrammaton in the midst of us, or the Negatively Existent One?’ ( Where they distinguished ) between Microprosopus, who is called Tetragrammaton, and between Macroprosopus, who is called AIN, Ain, the Negatively Existent?” (p. 121). But—the “ yod of the Ancient One is hidden and concealed.” ( Introd ., p . 35.) (Chap. XLV, 1152) “We have learned that there were ten (Rabbis) [companions, the Sephiroth] who entered into the SOD [mysteries of creation] and that seven came forth.” (Chap. XLV, 1158) “And when Rabbi Schimeon revealed the Arcana, there were found none present there save those ( companions ).” (Chap. XLV, 1159) “And Rabbi Schimeon called them the seven eyes of Tetragrammaton, like as it is written, Zech., iii, 9: ‘These are the seven eyes of Tetragrammaton’.” In the Bible the latter word is translated “The Lord,” which shows plainly that the Christians have accepted for their “Lord God” a fourth Sephirothal emanation and the male letter “Vau.” Is this the “Logos” every initiate has to seek union with, as “the ultimate result of his labours”? Then, he may as well remain in his septenary mortal body as long as he can. With respect to the other “obstacles,” they are as incorrectly stated. The “Figure of the man on the Throne” in Ezekiel answers in esotericism to the archetypal plane, the world of Atziloth, not to the Shekinah in Malkuth and Asiah, on the material plane; as will become"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"evident to any one who analyses the vision kabbalistically. For, firstly, there are four clear divisions of the symbolism 152   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS of the vision; namely, the form o f the man, the throne on which he is seated, the firmament above the heads of the living cr e atures, and the “living creatures” themselves with their ophanim or wheels. These again clearly answer to the four Kabbalistical worlds or planes themselves, i.e., Atziloth, the Archetypal—the shadowy figure of the man; Briah, the Creative—the throne; Yetzirah, the Formative, the firmament; Asiah, the Material, the living creatures. These answer again to the four letters of the tetragram thus: the uppermost point of Yod in IHVH to the “figure of the man,” the H ( He ) to the throne, the V ( Vau ) to the firmament, and the H final to the creatures. (See Plate IX of The Kabbalah Unveiled .) The “figure of the man” is not “the male form of Shekinah.” Shekinah is not “ an androgyne power.” * Shekinah is sexless or feminine if anything. It is primordial light emanating from the ever-concealed Ain-Soph. In the archetypal world it is Sephira, in the material and the formative it becomes Shekinah, the latent life end light of this inferior world of matter—the “veil of Ain-Soph” and the “divine presence” on the path of Malkuth from the material to the higher worlds. She is the Buddhi of the physical body—the soul or spark burning in the vessel; and after the vessel is broken, merging into the seventh (according to Theosophical computation) and into the first or Macroprosopus Kabbalistically, as it is the first ray from the concealed.† The plan revealed by Malkuth is given in the Book of Concealed Mystery, the Siphra Dtzenioutha, Chap.

Moreover there is an evident analogy between the above verse in Siphr Dtzenioutha and Chapters i to iv of Revelation. For the seven churches “of Asia” are identical with the “seven palaces” in Asiah, or the material septenary place.

Whatever the transcendental, metaphysical speculations and interpretations, which, of course, can be satisfied with Tetraktis on the plane of the Archetypal world, once that we descend into the world of the Astral and of the phenomenally occult, we cannot have less than seven principles upon which to base ourselves I have studied the Kabbala under two learned Rabbis, one of whom was an initiate, and there was no difference between the two teachings (the esoteric Eastern and the Western) in this instance. Of course it is well known that any one endowed with even a moderate dose of ingenuity can, if he has studied the three Kabbalistic modes of interpretation-especially the Notarikon —make what he likes of the unpointed Hebrew words and letters.

A good instance of the above dishonesty is found in Mr. Mathers’ translation of Knorr von Rosenroth’s Kabbalah Denudata. He gives us six specimens of the various readings of the first word only (B’rashith) in Genesis. With the rules of Notarikon the opening sentence “ B ’ rashith Bara Elohim eth hashamayim v ’ eth h ’ arets ,” or “In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth,” may be made to mean whatever one pleases; since the first and solitary word B’rashith is forced to yield six dogmatic teachings of the Latin Church. As shown by the aforesaid Kabbalist, Solomon Meir Ben Moses, a convert to Roman Catholicism in 1665, who took the name of Prosper Rugere, succeeded in proving on strictly Notariconist grounds that the said first word (B’rashith) revealed six Christian meanings, the 1st of these was “The Son, the Spirit, the Father, Their Trinity, Perfect Unity”; the 3rd, “Ye shall worship My firstborn, My first, Whose name is Jesus”; the 5th, “I will choose a virgin worthy to bring forth Jesus, and ye shall call her blessed” [ Kab.

For those “Seven Mysteries” in toto are known thoroughly only to the “M ASTERS OF W ISDOM ”; and those Masters would hardly indulge in polemical discussions whether in newspap er or periodical. What is the use then of losing time and power over proving that one facet of the diamond shines with more light and brilliancy than its sister facet instead of uniting all the forces to draw the attention of the profane to the radiance of the jewel itself. We students of the sacred science ought to help each other, encourage research and profit by our mutual knowledge, instead of unprofitably criticizing it to satisfy personal pride. This is how I look at it: for otherwise our enemies, who started by calling us humbugs on the sole strength of their sectarian and materialistic prejudices and bigotry, will be justified in reiterating their accusation on the ground of our mutual denunciations. Materialism is raising its ghastly head higher than ever. Knowledge, one of the scientific papers of London, gives us a foretaste of what is in store for the occultist. While reviewing the Kabbalah Unveiled, it is loud in proclaiming “the extraordinary intellectual vagaries of the Hebrew commentators on their scriptures.” It crushes under the weight of its materialist contempt the idea from Dr. Ginsburg’s The Kabbalah— that the mysteries of being were “first taught by God himself to a select company 1 5 8   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS of angels, who formed a theosop h ic school in Paradise”!* and winds up by a tremendous point of mocking admiration, in p arenthesis (!). This, on page 259 of Knowledge [New Series, Vol. X], Sept. 1, 1887. On page 245, Mr. Edward Clodd offers us, instead of the teachings of the “Theosophic angels,” those of the Darwinists of the Haekelian School. Having surveyed “a vast field” in Kosmos, “the limits of which shade into the unlimited on all sides,” this anti-Kabbalistic champion of modern science ends his “ vagaries ” by the following startling enunciation: “We began with the primitive nebula, we end with the highest forms of consciousness; the story of creation is shown [!?] to be the unbroken record of the evolution OF GAS INTO GENIUS ” [!!!]. This shows how we st a nd with the me n of modern science and how much we need all our forces to hold the materialists at bay. One word more and I have done. I am repeatedly asked to show my authority—book, page and verse—for the esoteric doctrine of the “Septenary.” This is like saying to one in the midst of a desert: prove to me that water is full of infusoria when there is no microscope to be got. Better than anyone, those who make such a claim upon me, know that outside of the few places where secret MSS. are stored for ages, no esoteric doctrines were ever written and plainly explained; otherwise they would have lost long ago their very name. There is such a thing as an “unwritten” Kabbala, as well as a written one, even in the West. Many things are orally explained, and always have been.

It is of so serious a nature that it seems well to make it the s ubject of this month’s editorial. Considering the truths uttered in its few lines, its importance and the bearing it has upon the much obscured subject of Theosophy, and its visible agent or vehicle—the Society of that name—the letter is certainly worthy of the most considerate answer. “ Fiat justitia, ruat coelum !” Justice will be done to both sides in the dispute namely, Theosophists and the members of the Theosophical Society * on the one hand, and the followers of the Divine Word (or Christos), and the so-called Christians, on the other. –––––––––– * Not all the members of the Th e osophical Society are Theosophists; nor are the members of the so-called Christian Churches all Christians, by any means.

Surely one of the purest and least self-incrusted duties of man, is to alleviate the sufferings of his fellow man? From what I read, and from what I daily come into immediate contact with, I can hardly think it would be possible to over-rate in contemplation, the intense privation and agonizing suffering that is—aye, say it— at this moment being endured by a vast proportion of our brothers and sisters, arising in a large measure from their not absolutely having the means for procuring the bare necessaries of existence?

If one of our main duties is that of exercising disinterested love towards the Brotherhood, surely “those more learned” ones, whether in the flesh, or out of it, can and will, if appealed to by their votaries, aid them in discovering ways and means for such an end, and in organising some great fraternal scheme for dealing rightly with questions which are so appalling in their complexity, and which must and do press with such irresistible force upon all those who are earnest in their endeavours to carry out the will of Christ in a Christian Land?

So far, we prefer to call it a philosophy; one, moreover, wh ic h contains every religion, as it is the essence and the foundation of all. Rule III of the Theos. Body says: “The Society represents no particular religious creed, is entirely unsectarian, and includes professors of all faiths.” ––––––––––– “ L ET E VERY M AN P ROVE H IS O WN W ORK”  161 This honest-spoken and sincer e letter contains two statements; an implied accusation against “Theosophy” ( i.e., the Soc i ety of that name), and a virtual admission that Christianity—or, again, rather its ritualistic and dogmatic religions—deserve the same and even a sterner rebuke. For if “Theosophy,” represented by its professors, merits on external appearance the reproach that so far it has failed to transfer divine wisdom from the region of the metaphysical into that of practical work, “Christianity,” that is, merely professing Christians, churchmen and laymen lie under a like accusation, evidently. “Theosophy” has, certainly, failed to discover infallible ways and means of` bringing all its votaries to exercise “disinterested love” in their Brotherhood; it has not yet been able to relieve suffering in mankind at large; but neither has Christianity. And not even the writer of the above letter, nor any one else, can show sufficient excuse for the Christians in this respect. Thus the admission that “those who are earnest in their endeavours to carry out the will of Christ in a Christian Land” need the help of “‘ those more learned’ ones, whether [pagan adepts] in the flesh, or [spirits?] out of it,” is very suggestive, for it contains the defence and the raison d’être of` the Theosophical Society. Tacit though it is, once that it comes from the pen of a sincere Christian, one who longs to learn some practical means to relieve the sufferings of the starving multitudes—this admission becomes the greatest and most complete justification for the existence of the Theosophical Brotherhood; a full confession of the absolute necessity for such a body independent of, and untrammelled by, any enchaining dogmas, and it points out at the same time the signal failure of Christianity to accomplish the desired results. Truly said Coleridge that “good works may exist without saving (?) principles, therefore cannot contain in themselves the principles of salvation; but saving principles never did, never can exist without good works.” Theosophists admit the definition, and disagree with the Christians only as to the nature of these “saving principles.” The"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Church (or churches) maintain that 162   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS the only saving principle is be lief in Jesus, or the carnalized Christ of the soul-killing dogma; theosophy, undogmatic a n d unsectarian, answers, it is not so. The only saving principle dwells in man himself, and has never dwelt outside of his immortal divine self; i.e., it is the true Christos, as it is the true Buddha, the divine inward light which proceeds from the eternal unmanifesting unknown ALL . And this light can only be made known by its works—faith in it having t o remain ever blind in all, save in the man himself who feels that light within his soul. Therefore, the tacit admission of the author of the above letter covers another point of great importance. The writer seems to have felt that which many, among those who strive to help the suffering, have felt and expressed. The creeds of the churches fail to supply the intellectual light, and the true wisdom which are needed to make the practical philanthropy carried out, by the true and earnest followers of Christ, a reality. The “practical” people either go on “doing good” unintelligently, and thus often do harm instead; or, appalled by the awful problem before them, and failing to find in their “churches” any clue, or a hope of solution, they retire from the battlefield and let themselves be drifted blindly by the current in which they happen to be born. Of late it has become the fashion for friends, as well as for foes, to reproach the Theosophical Society with doing no practical work, but losing itself in the clouds of metaphysics. Metaphysicians, we are told, by those who like to repeat stale arguments, have been learning their lesson for the last few thousand years; and it is now high time that they should begin to do some practical work. Agreed; but considering that the Christian churches count nearly nineteen centuries of existence, and that the Theosophical Society and Brotherhood is a body hardly twelve years old; considering again that the Christian churches roll in fabulous wealth, and number their adherents by hundreds of millions, whereas the Theosophical Brotherhood is but a few thousand strong, and that it has no fund, or funds, at its disposal, but that “ L ET E VERY M AN P ROVE H IS O WN W ORK”  163 98 per cent. of its members are a s poor and as uninfluential as the aristocracy of the Christian church is rich and pow erful; taking all this into consideration, there would be much to say if the theosophists would only choose to press the matter upon the public notice. Meanwhile, as the bitterest critics of the “leaders” of the Theosophical Society are by no means only outsiders, but as there are members of that society who always find a pretext to be dissatisfied, we ask: Can works of charity that will be known among men be accomplished without money? Certainly not. And yet, notwithstanding all this, none of its (European) members, except a few devoted officers in charge of societies, will do"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"practical work; but some of them, those especially who have never lifted a finger to relieve suffering, and help their outside, poorer brothers, are those who talk the most loudly, and are the bitterest in their denunciations of the unspirituality and the unfitness of the “leaders of theosophy.” By this they remove themselves into the outer ring of critics, like those spectators at the play who laugh at an actor passably representing Hamlet, while they themselves could not walk on to the stage with a letter on a salver. While in India, comparatively poor theosophists have opened gratuitous dispensaries for the sick, hospitals, schools, and everything they could think of, asking no returns from the poor, as the missionaries do, no abandonment of one’s forefathers’ religion, as a heavy price for favours received, have the English theosophists, as a rule, done a single thing for those suffering multitudes, whose pitiful cry rings throughout the whole Heavens as a protest against the actual state of things in Christendom ? We take this opportunity of saying, in reply to others as much as to our correspondent, that, up till now, the energies of the Society have been chiefly occupied in organizing, extending, and solidifying the Society itself, which work has taxed its time, energies, and resources to such an extent as to leave it far less powerful for practical charity than we would have wished. But, even so, compared with the influence and the funds at the disposal of the Society, its work in practical charity, if less widely 1 6 4   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS known, will certainly bear fav o urable comparison with that of professing Christians, with their enormous resources in mon ey, workers, and opportunities of all kinds. It must not be forgotten that practical charity is not one of the declared objects of the Society. It goes without saying, and needs no “declaration,” that every member of the Society must be practically philanthropic if he be a theosophist at all; and our declared work is, in reality, more important and more efficacious than work in the every-day plane which bears more evident and immediate fruit, for the direct effect of an appreciation of theosophy is to make those charitable who were not so before. Theosophy creates the charity which afterwards, and of its own accord, makes itself manifest in works. Theosophy is correctly—though in this particular case, it is rather ironically—termed “a high and Heaven-born religion.” It is argued that since it professes “to receive its advanced knowledge and Light from ‘those more learned in the Science of Life,’“ the latter ought and must , “if appealed to by their votaries [the theosophists], aid them in discovering ways and means . . . . . in organizing some great fraternal scheme,” etc. The scheme was planned, and the rules and laws to guide such a practical brotherhood, have been given by “those more learned in the Science of [practical, daily, altruistic ] Life,” aye, verily “more learned” in it than any other men since the days of Gautama Buddha and the Gnostic Essenes. The “scheme” dates back to the year when the Theosophical Society was founded. Let anyone read its wise and noble laws embodied to this day in the Statutes of the Fraternity, and judge for himself whether, if carried out rigorously and applied to practical life, the “scheme” would not have proved the most beneficent to mankind in general, and especially to our poorer brethren, of “the starving multitudes.” Theosophy"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"teaches the spirit of “non-separateness,” the evanescence and illusion of human creeds and dogma, hence, inculcates universal love and charity for all mankind “ without distinction of race, colour, caste or creed ,” is it not therefore the fittest to alleviate the sufferings of mankind? “ L ET E VERY M AN P ROVE H IS O WN W ORK”  165 No true theosophist would ref u se admission into a hospital, or any charitable establishment, to any man, woman o r child, under the pretext that he is not a theosophist, as a Roman Catholic would when dealing with a Protestant, and vice versa. No true theosophist of the original rules would fail to put into practice the parable of the “Good Samaritan,” or proffer help only to entice the unwary who, he hopes, will become a pervert from his god and the gods of his forefathers. None would slander his brother, none let a needy man go unhelped, none offer fine talk instead of practical love and charity. Is it then the fault of Theosophy, any more than it is the fault of the Christ-teachings, if the majority of the members of the Theosophical Society, often changing their philosophical and religious views upon entering our Body, have yet remained practically the same as they were when professing lip Christianity? Our laws and rules are the same as given to us from the beginning; it is the general members of the Society who have allowed them to become virtually obsolete. Those few who are ever ready to sacrifice their time and labour to work for the poor, and who do, unrecognized and unthanked for it, good work wherever they can, are often too poor themselves to put their larger schemes of charity into objective practical form, however willing they may be. “The fault I find with the Theosophical Society,” said one of the most eminent surgeons in London to one of the editors, quite recently, “is that I cannot discover that any of its members really lead the Christ-life.” This seemed a very serious accusation from a man who is not only in the front rank of his profession, and valued for his kindly nature, by his patients, and by society, and well known as a quiet doer of many good deeds. The only possible answer to be made was that the Christ-life is undeniably the ideal of every one worthy in any sense of the name of a Theosophist, and that if it is not lived it is because there are none strong enough to carry it out. Only a few days later the same complaint was put in a more graphic form by a celebrated lady-artist. 166   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS “You Theosophists don’t do enou gh good for me,” she said pithily. And in her case also there is the right to speak , g iven by the fact that she leads two lives—one a butterfly existence in society, and the other a serious one, which makes little noise, but has much purpose. Those who regard life as a great vocation, like the two critics of the Theosophical movement whom we have just quoted, have a right to demand of such a movement more than mere words. They themselves endeavour very quietly to lead the “Christ-life,” and"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"they cannot understand a number of people uniting in the effort towards this life without practical results being apparent. Another critic of the same character who has the best possible right to criticise, being a thoroughly practical philanthropist and charitable to the last degree, has said of the Theosophists that their much talking and writing seems to resolve itself into mere intellectual luxury, productive of no direct good to the world. The point of difference between the Theosophists (when we use this term we mean, not members of the Society, but people who are really using the organization as a method of learning more of the true wisdom-religion which exists as a vital and eternal fact behind all such efforts) and the practical philanthropists, religious or secular, is a very serious one, and the answer, that probably none of them are strong enough yet to lead the “Christ-life,” is only a portion of the truth. The situation can be put very plainly, in so many words. The religious philanthropist holds a position of his own, which cannot in any way concern or affect the Theosophist. He does not do good merely for the sake of doing good, but also as a means towards his own salvation. This is the outcome of the selfish and personal side of man’s nature, which has so coloured and affected a grand religion that its devotees are little better than the idol-worshippers who ask their deity of clay to bring them luck in business, and the payment of debts. The religious philanthropist who hopes to gain salvation by good works has simply, to quote a well-worn yet ever fresh witticism, exchanged worldliness for other-worldliness. “ L ET E VERY M AN P ROVE H IS O WN W ORK”  167 The secular philanthropist is r eally at heart a socialist, and nothing else; he hopes to make men happy and good by bette r ing their physical position. No serious student of human nature can believe in this theory for a moment. There is no doubt that it is a very agreeable one, because if it is accepted there is immediate, straightforward work to undertake. “The poor ye have always with you.” The causation which produced human nature itself produced poverty, misery, pain, degradation, at the same time that it produced wealth, and comfort, and joy and glory. Lifelong philanthropists, who have started on the work with a joyous youthful conviction that it is possible to “do good,” have, though never relaxing the habit of charity, confessed to the present writer that, as a matter of fact, misery cannot be relieved. It is a vital element in human nature, and is as necessary to some lives as pleasure is to others. It is a strange thing to observe how practical philanthropists will eventually, after long and bitter experience, arrive at a conclusion which, to an occultist, is from the first a working hypothesis. This is, that misery is not only endurable, but agreeable to many who endure it. A noble woman, whose life has been given to the rescue of the lowest class of wretched girls, those who seem to be driven to vice by want, said, only a few days since, that with many of these outcasts it is not possible to raise them to any apparently happier lot. And this she distinctly stated (and she can speak with authority, having spent her life literally among them, and studied them thoroughly), is not so much from any love of vice, but from love of that very state which the wealthy classes call misery. They prefer the savage life of a bare-foot, half-clad creature, with no roof at night and no food by day, to"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"any comforts which can be offered them. By comforts, we do not mean the workhouse or the reformatory, but the comforts of a quiet home; and we can give chapter and verse, so to speak, to show that this is the case, not merely with the children of outcasts, who might be supposed to have a savage heredity, but with the children of gentle, cultivated, and Christian people. 168   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS Our great towns hide in their sl ums thousands of beings whose history would form an inexplicable enigma, a perfect l y baffling moral picture, could they be written out clearly, so as to be intelligible. But they are only known to the devoted workers among the outcast classes, to whom they become a sad and terrible puzzle, not to be solved, and therefore, better not discussed. Those who have no clue to the science of life are compelled to dismiss such difficulties in this manner, otherwise they would fall, crushed beneath the thought of them. The social question as it is called, the great deep waters of misery, the deadly apathy of those who have power and possessions—these things are hard]y to be faced by a generous soul who has not reached to the great idea of evolution, and who has not guessed at the marvellous mystery of human development. The Theosophist is placed in a different position from any of these persons, because he has heard of the vast scope of life with which all mystic and occult writers and teachers deal, and he has been brought very near to the great mystery. Indeed, none, though they may have enrolled themselves as Fellows of the Society, can be called in any serious sense Theosophists, until they have begun to consciously taste in their own persons, this same mystery; which is, indeed, a law inexorable, by which man lifts himself by degrees from the state of a beast to the glory of a God. The rapidity with which this is done is different with every living soul; and the wretches who hug the primitive task-master, misery, choose to go slowly through a tread-mill course which may give them innumerable lives of physical sensation—whether pleasant or painful, well-beloved because tangible to the very lowest senses. The Theosophist who desires to enter upon occultism takes some of Nature’s privileges into his own hands by that very wish, and soon discovers that experiences come to him with double-quick rapidity. His business is then to recognise that he is under a—to him—new and swifter law of` development, and to snatch at the lessons that come to him. But, in recognising this, he also makes another discovery. He sees that it takes a very wise man to do “ L ET E VERY M AN P ROVE H IS O WN W ORK”  169 good works without danger of do ing incalculable harm. A highly developed adept in life may grasp the nettle, and by his g r eat intuitive powers, know whom to relieve from pain and whom to leave in the mire that is their best teacher. The poor and wretched themselves"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"will tell anyone who is able to win their confidence that disastrous mistakes are made by those who come from a different class and endeavour to help them. Kindness and gentle treatment will sometimes bring out the worst qualities of a man or woman who has led a fairly presentable life when kept down by pain and despair. May the Master of Mercy forgive us for saying such words of any human creatures, all of whom are a part of ourselves, according to the law of human brotherhood which no disowning of it can destroy. But the words are true. None of us know the darkness which lurks in the depths of our own natures until some strange and unfamiliar experience rouses the whole being into action So with these others who seem more miserable than ourselves. As soon as he begins to understand what a friend and teacher pain can be, the Theosophist stands appalled before the mysterious problem of human life, and though he may long to do good works, equally dreads to do them wrongly until he has himself acquired greater power and knowledge. The ignorant doing of good works may be vitally injurious, as all but those who are blind in their love of benevolence are compelled to acknowledge. In this sense the answer made as to lack of Christ-like lives among Theosophists, that there are probably none strong enough to live such, is perfectly correct and covers the whole question. For it is not the spirit of self-sacrifice, or of devotion, or of desire to help that is lacking, but the strength to acquire knowledge and power and intuition, so that the deeds done shall really be worthy of the “Buddha-Christ” spirit. Therefore it is that Theosophists cannot pose as a body of philanthropists, though secretly they may adventure on the path of good works. They profess to be a body of learners merely, pledged to help each other and all the rest of humanity, so far as 170   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS in them lies, to a better unders t anding of the mystery of life, and to a better knowledge of the peace which lies beyond it. Bu t as it is an inexorable law, that the ground must be tilled if the harvest is to be reaped, so Theosophists are obliged to work in the world unceasingly, and very often in doing this to make serious mistakes, as do all workers who are not embodied Redeemers. Their efforts may not come under the title of good works, and they may be condemned as a school of idle talkers, yet they are an outcome and fruition of this particular moment of time, when the ideas which they hold are greeted by the crowd with interest; and therefore their work is good, as the lotus-flower is good when it opens in the midday sun. None know more keenly and definitely than they that good works are necessary; only these cannot be rightly accomplished without knowledge. Schemes for Universal Brotherhood, and the redemption of mankind, might be given out plentifully by the great adepts of life, and would be mere dead-letter utterances while individuals remain ignorant, and unable to grasp the great meaning of their teachers. To Theosophists we say, let us carry out the rules given us for our society before we ask for any further schemes or laws.

The primitive writers of the Logia (now the Gospels) knew certainly the truth, and the whole truth; but their successors had, as certainly, only dogma and form, which lead to hierarchical power at heart, rather than the spirit of the so-called Christ’s teachings.

The atonements by blood—blood-covenants and blood-transferences from gods to men, and by men, as sacrifices to the gods—are the first key-note struck in every cosmogony and theogony; soul, life and blood were synonymous words in every language, pre-eminently with the Jews; and that blood-giving was life-giving. Many a legend among (geographically) alien nations ascribes soul and consciousness in newly-created mankind to the blood of the god-creators Berosus records a Chaldean legend ascribing the creation of a new race of mankind to the admixture of dust with the blood that flowed from the severed head of the god Belus. “On this account it is that men are rational, and partake of divine knowledge,” explains Berosus.* And Lenormant has shown ( The Beginnings of History , etc., p. 52, footnote) that “the Orphics . . . said that the immaterial part of man, his soul [his life], sprang from the blood of Dionysos Zagreus, whom these Titans had torn to pieces. . . .” 8 Blood “revivifies the dead”— i.e ., i n terpreted metaphysically, it gives conscious life and a soul to the man of matter or clay—such as the modern materialist is now.

The author of the Clementine Homilies 10 is right; the mystery of Christos—now supposed to have b een taught by Jesus of Nazareth—“was identical” with that which from the first had been communicated “ to those who were worthy ,” as quoted in another lecture.* We may learn from the Gospel according to Luke, that the “worthy” were those who had been initiated into the mysteries of the Gnosis, and who were “accounted worthy” to attain that “resurrection from the dead” in this life . . . . “those who knew that they could die no more, being equal to the angels as sons of God and sons of the Resurrection.” In other words, they were the great adepts of whatever religion; and the words apply to all those who, without being Initiates, strive and succeed, through personal efforts to live the life and to attain the naturally ensuing spiritual illumination in blending their personality—the “Son”—with the “Father,” their individual divine Spirit, the God within them. This “resurrection” can never be monopolized by the Christians, but is the spiritual birth-right of every human being endowed with soul and spirit, whatever his religion may be. Such individual is a Christ-man.

But there is nothing to suppose, since it began by a “play of words,” indeed. The name Christus was not “distorted into Chrêstos,” as the learned author would make his readers believe (I, p. 19), but it was the adjective and noun Chrêstos which became distorted into Christus, and applied to Jesus.

His dislike notwithstanding; Mr. Farrar is obliged to admit that the name Christian was first INVENTED , by the sneering, mocking Antiochians, as early as A.D . 44, but had not come into general use before the persecution by Nero. “Tacitus ( Ann ., xv , 44),” he says, “uses the word ‘ Christianos ’ with something of an apology.

For Tacitus, speaking of those whom the masses called “Christians,” describes them as a set of men detested for their enormities and crimes. No wonder, for history repeats itself. There are, no doubt, thousands of noble, sincere, and virtuous Christian-born men and women now. But we have only to look at the viciousness of Christian “heathen” converts; at the morality of those proselytes in India, whom the missionaries themselves decline to take into their service, to draw a parallel between the converts of 1,800 years ago, and the modern heathens “touched by grace .” † Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Lactantius, Clemens Alexandrinus, and others spelt it in this way. –––––––––– 186  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS directly borrowed from the Temple terminology of the Pagans, and meant the same thing. The God of the Jews was now substituted for the Oracle and the other gods; the generic designation “Chrêstos” became a noun applied to one special personage, and new terms such as Chrêstianoi and Chrêstodoulos , “a follower or server of Chrêstos”—were coined out of the old material. This is shown by Philo Judaeus, a monotheist, assuredly, using already the same term for monotheistic purposes. For he speaks of ( theochrêstos ), “God-declared,” or one who is declared by god, and of ( logia theochrêsta ), “sayings delivered by Go d”—which proves that he wrote at a time (between the first century B.C. , and the first A.D. ) when neither Christians nor Chrêstians were yet known under these names, but still called themselves the Nazarenes. The notable difference between the two words, , “consulting or obtaining response from a god or oracle” ( being the Ionic earlier form of it), and ( chrio ), “to rub, to anoint” (from which t he name Christos), have not prevented the ecclesiastical adoption and coinage from Philo’s expression of that other term , “anointed by God.” Thus the quiet substitutio n of the letter for for dogmatic purposes, was achieved i n the easiest way, as we now see. The secular meaning of Chrêstos runs throughout the classical Greek literature pari passu with that given to it in the mysteries.

It is in this sense that it is used by Euripides ( Ion, 1320) 18 and by Aeschylus (I C). 19 This qualification was applied to those whom the god, oracle, or any superior had proclaimed this, that, or anything else. An instance may be given in this case. The words used by Pindar ( Odes: Pythia , IV, 6) 20 mea n “the oracle proclaimed him the coloniser.” In this case the genius of the Greek language permits that the man so proclaimed should be called ( Chrêstos ). Hence this term was applie d to every Disciple recognized by a Master, as also to every good man. Now, the Greek language affords strange etymologies. Christian theology has chosen and decreed that the name Christos should be taken as derived from , (Chrisô), “anointed with scented un guents or oil.” But this word has several significances. It is used by Homer, certainly, as applied to the rubbing with oil of the body after bathing ( Iliad, XXIII, 186; also in Odyssey, IV, 252) 21 as other ancient writers do. Yet the word ( Christês ) means rather a white-wa sher, while the word Chrêstês ( ) means priest and prophet, a term far more applicable to Jesus, than that of the “Anointed,” since, as Nork shows on the authority of the Gospels, he never was anointed, either as king or priest. In short, there is a deep mystery underlying all this scheme, which, as I maintain, only a thorough knowledge of the Pagan –––––––––– Good people, were pre-extant. Numerous Greek inscriptions show that the departed, the hero, the saintly one—that is, the ‘Good’—was styled Chrêstos, or the Christ, and from this meaning of the ‘ Good ‘ does Justin, the primal apologist, derive the Christian name. This identifies it with the Gnostic source, and with the ‘ Good God ‘ who revealed himself according to Marcion—that is, the Un-Nefer or Good-opener of the Egyptian theology.”—( Agnostic Annual .) 17 –––––––––– 188  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"mysteries is capable of unveiling.* It is not what the early Fathers, who had an object to achieve, may affirm or deny, that is the important point, but rather what is now the evidence for the real significance given to the two terms Chrêstos and Christos by the ancients in the pre-Christian ages. For the latter had no object to achieve, therefore nothing to conceal or disfigure, and their evidence is naturally the more reliable of the two. This evidence can be obtained by first studying the meaning given to these words by the classics, and then their correct significance searched for in mystic symbology. Now Chrêstos, as already said, is a term applied in various senses. It qualifies both Deity and Man. It is used in the former sense in the Gospels, as in Luke (vi, 35) , where it means “kind;” and “merciful,” , [and] in I Peter (ii, 3), where it is sa id, “Kind is the Lord,” . On the other hand, it is explained by Cl emens Alexandrinus as simply meaning a good man: “All who believe in Chrêst (a good man) both are, and are called Chrêstians, that is good men” ( Strom., lib.

It did not originate as a mere type! The preserved mummy was the dead body of any one that was Karest, or mummified, to be kept by the living; and, through constant repetition, this became a type of the resurrection from (not of!) the dead.” 22 See the explanation of this further on. –––––––––– T HE E SOTERIC C HARACTER OF THE G OSPELS 189 have fallen off from his earlier views, could not exonerate him from his pledge of secrecy. And as a Theosophist and a Gnostic, one who knew, Clemens must have known that Christos was “the WAY ,” while Chrêstos was the lonely traveller journeying on to reach the ultimate goal through that “Path,” which goal was Christos, the glorified Spirit of “T RUTH ,” the reunion with which makes the soul (the Son) ONE with the (Father) Spirit.

We read in it . 31 Read esoterically, this string of meaningless detach ed nouns, which has no sense to the profane, contains a real prophecy—only not referring to Jesus—and a verse from the mystic catechism of the Initiate. The prophecy relates to the coming down upon the Earth of the Spirit of Truth (Christos), after which advent—that has once more nought to do with Jesus—will begin the Golden Age; the verse refers to the necessity before reaching that blessed condition of inner (or subjective) theophany and theopneusty, to pass through the crucifixion of flesh or matter. Read exoterically, the words “ Iêsous Chreistos theou huios sôtêr stauros ,” meaning literally “Iesus, Christos, Son of God, Saviour, Cross,” are most excellent handles to hang a Christian prophecy on, but they are pagan, not Christian.

It is not the place here to prove side issues in mythology, however. It suffices to show the connection between the mythical characters of hoary antiquity and the later fables that marked the beginning of our era of civilization. Asclepios (Esculapius) was the divine physician, the “Healer,” the “Saviour,” , as he was called, a title also given to Janus of Del phi; and IASO, the daughter of Asclepios, was the goddess of healing, under whose patronage were all the candidates for initiation in her father’s temple, the novices or chrêstoi, called “the sons of Iaso.” ( Vide for name, Plutus, 701, by Aristophanes.) –––––––––– four equal sides, with a door and three windows on each side.

Hence he is often represented with the number 300 in one hand, and in the other 65, or the number of days of the Solar year. Now Chanoch (Kanoch and Enoch in the Bible) is, as may be shown on Kabalistic authority, whether son of Cain, son of Seth, or the son of Methuselah, one and the same personage. As Chanoch (according to Fuerst), “he is the Initiator , Instructor —of the astronomical circle and solar year,” as son of Methuselah, who is said to have lived 365 years and been taken to heaven alive, as the representative of the Sun (or god).

The secret doctrine teaches that the first two words mean simply “son of Iaso, a Chrêstos,” or serv ant of the oracular God. Indeed is in the Ionic dialect , and the expression ( Iêsous ) — in its archaic form, — simply means “the son of Iaso or Iêsô ,” the “healer,” i.e ., .

Nor could the Sibyl of Erythrae have spelt it originally otherwise, as Erythrae, her very residence, was a town in Ionia (from Ion or Janus) opposite Chios; and that the Ionic preceded the Attic form.

(“The Name and Nature of the Christ.”—G ERALD M ASSEY .) 39 Mr. G. Massey connect s the Greek Christos or Christ with the Egyptian Karest, the “mummy type of immortality,” an d proves it very thoroughly. He begins by saying that in Egyptian the “Word of Truth” is Ma-Kheru, and that it is the title of Horus. Thus, as he shows, Horus preceded Christ as the Messenger of the Word of Truth, the Logos or the manifestor of the divine nature in humanity. In the same paper he writes as follows: The Gnosis had three phases—astronomical, spiritual, and doctrinal, and all three can be identified with the Christ of Egypt. In the astr o nomical phase the constellation Orion is called the Sahu, or mummy . The soul of Horus was represented as rising from the dead and ascending to heaven in the stars of Orion. The mummy-image was the preserved one, the saved, therefore a portrait of the Saviour, as a type of immortality. This was the figure of a dead man, which, as Plutarch and Herodotus tell us, was carried round at an Egyptian banquet when the guests were invited to look on it and eat and drink and be happy, because, when they died, they would become what the image symbolised—that is, they also would be immortal! This type of immortality was called the Karest, or Karust, and it was the Egyptian Christ. To Kares means to embalm, anoint, to make the Mummy as a type of the eternal; and, when made, it was called the Karest ; so that this is not merely a matter of name for name, the Karest for the Christ. We are able to get beyond a Greek word signifying the anointed, or greased; we can here identify a determinative in the domain of thin g s. This image of the Karest was bound up in a woof without a seam, the proper vesture of the Christ! No matter what the length of the bandage might be, and some of the mummy-swathes have been unwound that were 1,000 yards in length, the woof was from beginning to end without a seam. . . . . . . Now, this seamless robe of the Egyptian Karest is a very tell-tale type of the mystical Christ, who becomes historic in the Gospels as the wearer of a coat or chiton, made without a seam, which neither the Greek nor the Hebrew fully explains, but which is explained by the Egyptian Ketu for the woof, and by the seamless robe or swathing without seam that was made for eternal wear and worn by the Mummy-Christ, the image of immortality in the tombs of Egypt. . . . . . 198  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS . . . . Further, Jesus is put to death in accordance with the instructions given for making the Karest. Not a bone must be brok e n. The true Karest must be perfect in every member. “This is he who comes out sound; whom men know not is his name.” In the Gospels Jesus rises again with every member sound, like the perfectly-preserved Karest, to demonstrate the physical resurrection of the mummy. But, in the Egyptian original, the mummy transforms. The deceased says: “I am spiritualised. I am become a soul. I rise as a God.” This transformation into the spiritual image, the Ka, has been omitted in the Gospel, and, as a result, the Christian Christ is neither physical nor spiritual; the Gnostic types having been continued without the Gnosis. [pp. 9-10.] . . . . This spelling of the name as Chrest or Chrést in Latin is supremely important, because it enables me to prove the identity with the Egyptian Karest or Karust, the name of the Christ as the embalmed mummy, which was the image of the resurrection in Egyptian tombs, the type of immortality, the likeness of the Horus, who rose again and made the pathway out of the sepulchre for those who were his disciples or followers."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Moreover, this type of the Karest or Mummy-Christ is reproduced in the Catacombs of Rome. No representation of the supposed historic resurrection of Jesus has been found on any of the early Christian monuments. But, instead of the missing fact, we find the scene of Lazarus being raised from the dead. This is depicted over and over again as the typical resurrection where there is no real one! The scene is not exactly in accordance with the rising from the grave in the Gospel. It is purely Egyptian, and Lazarus is an Egyptian mummy! Thus Lazarus, in each representation, is the mummy-type of the resurrection; Lazarus is the Karest, who was the Egyptian Christ, and who is reproduced by Gnostic art in the Catacombs of Rome as a form of the Gnostic Christ, who was not and could not become an historical character. Further, as the thing is Egyptian, it is probable that the name is derived from Egyptian. If so, Laz (equal to Ras) means to be raised up, while aru is the mummy by name. With the Greek terminal s this becomes Lazarus. In the course of humanizing the mythos the typical representation of the resurrection found in the tombs of Rome and Egypt would become the story of Lazarus being raised from the dead. This Karest type of the Christ in the Catacombs is not limited to Lazarus. [pp. 12-13.] By means of the Karest type the Christ and the Christians can both be traced in the ancient tombs of Egypt. The mummy was made in this likeness of the Christ. It was the Christ by name, identical with the Chrestoi of the Greek Inscriptions.

Ma-Kheru is the term that is always applied to the faithful ones who win the crown of life and wear it at the festival which is designated “Come thou to me”—an invitation by Horus the Justifier to those who are the “Blessed ones of his father, Osiris”—they who, having made the Word of Truth the law of their lives, were the Justified= , the Christians, on earth. [p. 12.] In a fifth century r epresentation of the Madonna and child from the cemetery of St. Valentinus, the new-born babe lying in a box or crib is also the Karest, or mummy-type, further identified as the divine babe of the solar mythos by the disk of the sun and the cross of the equinox at the back of the infant’s head. Thus the child-Christ of the historic faith is born, and visibly begins in the Karest image of the dead Christ, which was the mummy-type of the resurrection in Egypt for thousands of years before the Christian era. This doubles the proof that the Christ of the Christian Catacombs was a survival of the Karest of Egypt. Moreover, as Didron shows, there was a portrait of the Christ who had his body painted red !* It was a popular tradition that the Christ was of a red complexion. This, too, may be explained as a survival of the Mummy-Christ. It was an aboriginal mode of rendering things tapu by colouring them red. The dead corpse was coated with red ochre—a very primitive mode of making the mummy, or the anointed one. Thus the God Ptah tells Rameses II that he has “ re-fashioned his flesh in vermilion. ” Besides which, the Initiated in the Greek mysteries were daubed or anointed with clay (Demosthenes, De corona , 313). This anointing with red ochre is called Kura by the Maori, who likewise made the Karest or Christ. We see the mummy-image continued on another line of descent when we learn that, among other pernicious heresies and deadly sins with which the Knights Templars were charged, was the impious custom of adoring a Mummy that had red eyes. Their Idol, called Baphomet, is also thought to have been a mummy. . . . . . . . . The Mummy was the earliest human image of the Christ.

Occultism pure and simple finds the same mystic elements in the Christian as in other faiths, though it rejects as emphatically its dogmatic and historic character. It is a fact that in the terms (See Acts, v, 42; ix, 34; I Co r., iii, 11, etc.), the article designating “Christos,” proves it simply a surname, like that of Phocion, who is referred to as (Plutarch, Vitae ). 41 Still, the perso nage (Jesus) so addressed—wheneve r he lived—was a great Initiate and a “Son of God.” For, we say it again, the surname Christos is based on, and the story of the Crucifixion derived from, events that preceded it. Everywhere, in India as in Egypt, in Chaldea as in Greece, all these legends were built upon one and the same primitive type; the voluntary sacrifice of the logoi— the rays of the one L OGOS , the direct manifested emanation from the One ever-concealed Infinite and Unknown—whose rays incarnated in mankind. They consented to fall into matter, and are, therefore, called the “Fallen Ones.” This is one of those great mysteries which can hardly be touched upon in a magazine article, but shall be noticed in a separate work of mine, The Secret Doctrine, very fully.

Belief in the Bible literally , and in a carnalised Christ, will not last a quarter of a century longer. The Churches will have to part with their cherished dogmas, or the 20th century will witness the downfall and ruin of all Christendom, and with it, belief even in a Christos, as pure Spirit. The very name has now become obnoxious, and theological Christianity must die out, never to resurrect again in its present form. This, in itself, would be the happiest solution of all, were there no danger from the natural reaction which is sure to follow: crass materialism will be the consequence and the result of centuries of blind faith, unless the loss of old ideals is replaced by other ideals, unassailable, because universal , and built on the rock of eternal truths instead of the shifting sands of human fancy. Pure immateriality must replace, in the end, the terrible anthropomorphism of those ideals in the conceptions of our modern dogmatists. Otherwise, why should Christian dogmas––the perfect counterpart of those belonging to other exoteric and pagan religions––claim any superiority? The bodies of all these were built upon the same astronomical and physiological (or phallic) symbols. Astrologically, every religious dogma the world over, may be traced to, and located in, the Zodiacal signs and the Sun.

It is the number of Melchizedek’s name, for the value of the last in 304 and Melchizedek was the priest of the Most High God, without beginning nor ending of days. The solution and secret of Melchizedek are found in the fact that. It has been said in the ancient Pantheons the two planets which had existed from eternity [ aeonic eternity ], and were eternal, were the sun and the moon, or Osiris and Isis, hence this term of without beginning nor ending of days. 304 multiplied by two is 608.

Another proof of the claim that the Gospel of Matthew in the usual Greek texts is not th e original gospel written in Hebrew, is given by no less an authority than St. Jerome (or Hieronymus). The suspicion of a conscious and gradual euhemerization of the Christ principle ever since the beginning, grows into a conviction, once that one becomes acquainted with a certain confession contained in Book II of the Comment. to Matthew by Hieronymus.

But while admitting also that this gospel “was written in Hebrew characters and by the hand of himself ” ( Matthew ), yet in another place he contradicts himself and assures posterity that as it was tampered with , and re-written by a disciple of Manichaeus, named Seleucus . . “the ears of the Church properly refused to listen to it.” 60 No wonder that the very meaning of the terms Chrêstos and Christos , and the be a ring of both on “Jesus of Nazareth,” a name coined out of Joshua the Nazar , has now become a dead letter for all with the exception of non-Christian Occultists. For even the Kabalists have no original data now to rely upon. The Zohar and the Kabala have been remodelled by Christian hands out of recognition; and were it not for a copy of the Chaldean Book of Numbers there would remain no better than garbled accounts. Let not our Brothers, the so-called Christian Kabbalists of England and France, many of whom are Theosophists, protest too vehemently; for this is history (See Munk). It is as foolish to maintain, as some German Orientalists and modern critics still do, that the Kabala has never existed before the day of the Spanish Jew, Moses de León, accused of having forged this pseudograph in the 13th century, as to claim that any of the Kabalistical works now in our possession are as original as they were when Rabbi Shimon Ben Yochai delivered the “tradition” to his son and followers.

However, the subject of the esoteric meaning of the Gospel story, the occult significance of its symbolism, and the historicity of Jesus, have been discussed by H. P. B. in several other important essays, articles and footnotes appended to contributions from other writers. Special mention should be made of her lengthy controversy with the Abbé Roca published in the pages of Le Lotus (Vol. II, December, 1887; Vol. III, April and June, 1888); her powerful article on “The Origin of the Gospels and the Bishop of Bombay,” which appeared in The Theosophist (Vol. . IV, October, 1882, pp. 6-9); her article entitled “A Word with the Theosophists” ( ibid ., Vol. IV, March, 1883, pp. 143-45), her valuable editorial notes to an article on “The Crucifixion of Man,” published in Lucifer (Vol. II, May, 1888, T HE E SOTERIC C HARACTER OF THE G OSPELS  219 pp. 243-50), embodying an analysis of the “Cry on the Cross”; her many passages on similar subjects th r o u g h o u t th e v o lumes of The Secret Doctrine and Isis Unveiled ; and the several Sections devoted almost exclusively to these themes in the volume entitled “The Secret Doctrine, Vol. III,” which was published in 1897. 5 This has reference to Gerald Massey’s very able letter ( Lucifer , Vol. I, No. 2, October, 1887, pp. 135-138) in which he answers an objection from Dr. G. Wyld who is surprised to hear anyone say that the teachings ascribed to Jesus are contradictory. Mr. Massey points out a large number of direct and implied contradictions in the text of the accepted Gospels, such as John , x, 30 and John , xiv, 28 (also Matt ., xxiv, 36), John , v, 22, 30 and John , viii, 15, as well as John , xii, 47; John , viii, 14, 18 and John , v, 31; John , v, 33 and John , xv, 27; Matt ., v, 16 and Matt ., vi, 1; Matt ., v, 39, as well as Matt ., xxvi, 52, contradicted by Luke , xxii, 36 and Matt ., x, 34; Luke , xii, 4 and John , vii, 1. Mr. Massey expresses his readiness “to meet any competent and well-informed defender of the faith upon the platform or in the press.” He says: “I should prefer it to be a bishop, who is also an Egyptologist. But beggars are not allowed to be choosers. I am prepared at any time to demonstrate the entirely mythical and mystical origin of the Christ, and the non-spiritual, non-historical beginnings of the vast complex called Christianity.” To this are appended two separate Editorial Notes, presumably by H. P. B. The first states: “Any ‘Bishop Egyptologist,’ or even Assyriologist, of whom we have heard there are not a few in England, is cordially invited to defend his position in the pages of Lucifer . The ‘Son of the Morning’ is the Light-Bearer , and welcomes light from every quarter of the globe.” The second Note states: “As Lucifer cannot concur in the exclusively exoteric view, taken by Mr. Massey, of this allegorical, though none the less philosophical, scripture, the next number will contain an article dealing with the esoteric meaning of the New Testament.” 6 This Kabalistic MS. may be found in the Adyar Archives.

On the front cover, in gold letters, stands the name of H. P. Blavatsky, and beneath it the capital letters P. S., whose meaning is uncertain. Inside, on the fly-leaf, H. P. B., has written her name: “H. P. Blavatsky, Ostende, 1887,” and on the same page is a rubber stamp: “H. P.

There still remain in the book more than a dozen slips of paper, some of them torn scraps with H. P. B.’s handwriting on them, to mark certain pages. She has also written on some of the blank pages opposite the text, and occasionally has even corrected the text or inserted words, phrases or sentences between the lines. The book is in two Sections, the first one of 53 pages being an Introduction. The Second Section is made up of 18 smaller sections, starting with the number values of various Hebrew letters and relating them to the lunar year, man, Jehovah, etc., etc. Some of the headings are: “How the woman was taken out of the man”; “The covenant of Jehovah”; “The Parker ratio and the British inch”; “The Garden of Eden”; “The Flood”; “The Measures of the Great Pyramid,” etc. Apart from a few brief passages used by H.

He was regarded as a disciple of St. Peter. This authorship is very much in question. Chief among these writings are: 1. The so-called Second Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians. 2. Two Epistles on Virginity. 3. The Homilies and Recognitions , with which may be classed the Epistle of Clement to James. 4. The Apostolic Constitutions . 5. Five Epistles forming part of the forged Decretals. The Clementine literature throws light upon a very obscure phase of Christian development, that of Judeo-Christianity. Especial prominence was given to the Homilies and Recognitions by the Tübingen School which considered them of primary importance for the history of the first stage of Christianity. The Greek original of these two Scriptures has been lost, but can be placed by conjecture somewhere about the beginning of the 3rd century. We have only a Latin translation by Rufinus of Aquileia (b. ca. 345 A.D .—d. 410 A.D .) a rather unreliable characte r as far as scholarship is concerned. These works are generally admitted to have emanated from the Ebionitic par ty of the early Church, once the purest form of primitive Christianity. They are most likely based on older Petrine writings, such as the Preaching of Peter ( ) and the Travels o f Peter ( ). The judaistic a nd ebionitic character of the lost originals can be inferred from the existing 3rd and 4th century orthodox versions. The Homilies purport to contain letters from Peter and Clement to James of Jerusalem and some twenty sermons preached by Peter while Clement was travelling with him. The Recognitions use similar 222  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS material in another setting. They contain discussions between Peter and Simon the Magician—who may have been St. Paul himself—regarding the identity of the true Mosaic and Christian religions.

The complete existing evidence on this controversial subject has been fully discussed by G. R. S. Mead in his valuable work, Did Jesus Live 100 B.C .? (London and Benares: Theos. Publ. Society, 1903). Éliphas Lévi, writing in La Science des Esprits (ed., of 1909, Paris, Félix Alcan, p. 37), speaks of a book which he calls the Disputation of Rabbi Jechiel . This is the Disputacio R. Jechielis cum quodam Nicolao , which is the second volume of a work by Johann Christoph Wagenseil (1633-1708) entitled: Tela ignea Satanae (Altdorfi Noricorum, 1681. 4to.). It is a very rare work which can be consulted in the British Museum. The same work contains also the Hebrew text of the Sepher Toldoth Jeshu (see Bibliogr. of Oriental Works, for further data). Jehiel Ben Joseph of Paris, tosafist and controversialist, was born at Meaux towards the end of the twelfth century. His French name was Sir Vives. In rabbinical literature he is variously designated as Jehiel of Paris, Jehiel the Holy, Jehiel the Pious, and Jehiel the Elder. He was one of the most distinguished disciples of Judah Sir Leon, whom he succeeded in 1224 as head of the Talmudistic School of Paris. This School was attended under him by upward of 300 disciples, among whom were well-known rabbis of the thirteenth century. Jehiel was held in great esteem even by non-Jews, and was favorably received at court. He was forced into many controversies with Christians, the main disputation having been the one he had to sustain, together with several other rabbis, on June 25-27, 1240, in the presence of Saint Louis and the court, against the Jewish apostate Nicholas Donin. The latter denounced the Talmud as containing blasphemies against Christianity. In spite of Jehiel’s great courage and dignity, this disputation resulted in the condemnation of the Talmud , after which the state of the Jews in France grew worse, and Jehiel was forced to leave with his son for Palestine, where he died in 1286. He was the author of several tosafot on various Talmudistic treatises. The passage from Arnobius Adversus Gentes , I, 43, runs as follows (See The Ante-Nicene Fathers , Vol. VI, p. 425): “My opponent will perhaps meet me with many other slanderous and childish charges which are commonly urged.

In this passage, a certain Triephon answers the question whether the affairs of the Christians were recorded in heaven, by saying: “All nations are there recorded, since Chrêstos exists even among the Gentiles.” 28 This passage is translated as follows by T.

Library ): “‘Christian,’ as far as translation goes, is derived from ‘anointing.’ Yes, and when it is mispronounced by you ‘Chrestian’ (for you have not even certain knowledge of the mere name) it is framed from ‘sweetness’ or ‘kindness.’“ 29 Higgins refers to the Unitarian critic, John Jones, LL.D.

They were supposed to be women inspired T HE E SOTERIC C HARACTER OF THE G OSPELS  227 by influences from higher regions, who were consulted for their prophetic utterances and flourished in different parts of the ancient world. It is likely that they ranged from the mediumistic and sensitive stage to that of true seership. According to Varro, they were ten in number, one of them being the Erythraean, whom Apollodorous of Erythrae claimed as a native of that city, though some considered her of Babylonian origin. She is said to have predicted to the Greeks, when they were sailing for Troy, that this city was destined to perish. The most celebrated Sibyl was the Cumaean, in Italy, spoken of by Naevius, and other Latin writers, especially Virgil. This was the Sibyl that accompanied Aeneas to the lower regions (Ovid, Metam ., XIV, 104 et seq .; Servius, In Verg . comm ., vi, 321). According to a well-known Roman legend, one of the Sibyls came to the palace of Tarquinius the Second, and offered to sell him nine books which she declared to contain the inspired prophecies of the Sibyl of Cumae. For these treasures she asked what the monarch regarded as an extravagant price. He refused to purchase the books and dismissed the woman with ridicule. The Sybyl turned aside and burned three of the volumes in the king’s presence. She then offered the remaining six for the same price previously asked for the whole, and when Tarquinius again refused and laughed at her, she burned three more, and offered the remaining three for the same price as before. This strange behaviour produced a great impression upon the monarch. She whom he had ridiculed as mad, he now regarded as inspired. He accordingly purchased what remained of the prophetic treasures, and the Sibyl disappeared and was never seen after . These books of so-called S ib y llin e v e r s e s w e r e p r e served with great care, a college of priests being appointed to have charge of them, and they were consulted with the greatest solemnity when the state seemed to he in danger, to the end that the will of the gods might be known and the danger averted. When the Capitol was burned during the troubles of Sylla, 83 B.C ., the Sibylline books deposited there were destroyed. To"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"repair this loss, commissioners were sent out to different parts of Greece to collect whatever could be found of the inspired writings of the Sibyls, to make a new collection. As regards the final fate of this second collection, much uncertainty prevails. It would seem, however, according to the best authorities, that the Emperor Honorius issued an order, 399 A.D ., to destroy it, in pursuance of which, Stilicho burned all these prophetic writings and demolished th e temple of Apollo where they were deposited. It should be clearly understood that the eight books of Sibylline verses extant today have no definite relation to these early Roman collections. They are oracles for the most part of a Judeo-Christian origin.

This custom was continued down into Christian times, and was borrowed by some Christians, so that in the second and third centuries A.D . a new class of oracles emanating from Christian sources came into being. Some of these were adaptations from previous Jewish sources, and others were entirely written by Christians. It is most likely that these Alexandrian and later collections contained in their text some fragments from the earlier, purely pagan oracles, and the one ascribed to the Erythraean Sibyl, and commented upon by H. P. B., is apparently one of these. It is to be found in acrostic form in the initial letters of verses 217-250 of Book VIII of the extant collection of Sibylline Oracles. The subject of Sibyls and their utterances calls for serious study and elucidation by students of the Esoteric Philosophy, as it throws a flood of light upon the latent powers of man and the mysteries of his psychic and noetic consciousness. One of the fullest accounts we have of the Sibyls of old is that found in the writings of Firmianus Lactantius ( Divine Institutes , Bk. I ch. vi; J. P. Migne, Patr. C. Compl ., Ser. Latina, Vol. VI, 140-47) This Latin Father flourished about the close of the 3rd century A.D.; he refers to Varro as his authority. The Sibyl and her oracles are the subject of the entire ch. xxxvii of a treatise entitled a Hortatory Address to the Creeks , usually attributed to Justin the Martyr and published in his writings (Migne, Part. C. Compl., Ser. Graeco-Latina, Vol. VI, 309 et seq .; M. S. Terry, The Sibylline Oracles , has a transl. of Migne’s Greek text), though its real authorship is uncertain. Augustine ( De civitate dei , Bk. XVIII, ch. xxiii) cites the first 27 lines of the above-mentioned acrostic, in a Latin translation which aims at retaining the acrostic form of the Greek. There is an English transl. of Augustine’s Latin version by Marcus Dods in Select Library of the Nicene and Post - Nicene Fathers (quoted by Terry also), where Dods aims to retain in English the acrostic form. The acrostic verses are quoted in full by Eusebius in his report of Constantine’s Oration to the Assembly of the Saints , xviii (Migne, Patr. C. Compl ., Ser. Graeco-Latina, XX, col. 1288-89).

St. Jerome does likewise. H. P. B.’s rendering is somewhat abbreviated and has minor differences from the original.

However, if the student refers to Isis Unveiled , II, 182, he will find the same facts spoken of, and quoted excerpts ascribed to “St. Jerome, V, 445.” This latter reference has proved to be an insurmountable obstacle to a number of scholarly students, who were unable to find it in the writings of St. Jerome, in spite of repeated efforts over a period of years. At the time that a large number of quotations occurring in Isis Unveiled were being checked for accuracy, this one had to be abandoned for lack of adequate data as to its source. As a result of more recent search, the actual source of these quotations, or rather series of excerpts, has been located. In connection with this, we owe a debt of gratitude to Foster M. Palmer, Reference Assistant in Charge of Reference Section, at the Harvard University Library, Cambridge, Mass., whose interest and helpfulness have been of much value in the course of the editorial work incident upon the publication of the present series of volumes. The passage used by H. P. B. was located in the Johannes Martianay edition of St. Jerome’s Works published in Five Volumes in Paris by Ludovicus Roulland, 1693-1706. The date of Vol. V is 1706, and in column 445 occurs the passage under discussion, in its original Latin.

In Vol. I of this work are several apocryphal gospels edited by Charles Michel, of which the second is “Pseudo-Matthew.” This is prefaced by two letters; the first being from the Bishops Chromatius and Heliodorus to Jerome, and the second being his reply to them. This second letter, in which we are interested, is to be found on pages 56-58, together with a translation into French. The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew is discussed in the Preface, pp. xix-xxii, where Michel dates it, on the basis of these letters, as not before the end of the 4th century A D and probably in the 6th. He regards the letters as “evidently apocryphal,” written at a period “when the name of St. Jerome had a very great authority.” Now the text given by Michel differs considerably from the one quoted above, which may be due to ancient errors of transcription or to later improvements. What is of importance is that Michel’s text makes far better sense.

Though they never gave this book to anyone to be transcribed, they transmitted its text some in one way and some in another. “And so it happened that this book, published by a disciple of Manichaeus, named Seleucus, who also wrote in false speech the Acts of the Apostles, contained matter not for edification, but for destruction; and that being such it was approved in a synod which the ears of the Church properly refused to listen to . . .” As to the Commentary to Matthew , Book II, chap. xii, 13, the only sentence in it which relates to the present subject is the following one: “. . . .

P. B.’s footnote reference to St. Jerome’s De viris inlustribus liber , cap. 3, it is of course fully apposite to the general subject, but seems to be attached at a wrong place in the text, resulting in somewhat of a confusion, possibly due to faulty proofreading of her MSS. The paragraph referred to in chapter 3 of St. Jerome’s work is as follows: “Mattheus, qui est Levi, ex publicano apostolus, primus in Iudaea propter eos qui ex circumcisione crediderant, Evangelium Christi Hebraeicis litteris verbisque composuit: quod quis postea in Graecum transtulerit, non satis certum est. Porro ipsum Hebraeicum hebetur usque hodie in Caesariensi bibliotheca, quam Pamphilus martyr studiosissime confecit.

In quo animadvertendum, quod ubicumque Evangelista, sive ex persona sua, sive ex persona Domini Salvatoris, veteris Scripturae testimoniis abutetur, non sequatur Septuaginta translatorum auctoritatem, sed Hebraicam, e quibus illa duo sunt: ‘ex Aegypti vocavi Filium,’ et: ‘quoniam Nazaraeus vocabitur’.” * which, translated into English reads: “Matthew who was called Levi, and who from a publican became an Apostle, was the first one in Judea who wrote an Evangel of Christ, in Hebrew language and letters, for the sake of those among the circumcized ones who had believed. It is not sufficiently certain as to who afterwards translated it into Greek. The Hebrew original could be found to this day in the library diligently collected at Caesarea by the Martyr Pamphilus. It was possible even for me to have access to this volume which the Nazarenes had been using in Veria, a city in Syria. It should be noted that wherever the Evangelist brings forth the testimony of the Old Testament, either himself or according to the man Salvatore, he does not follow the version of the Septuaginta, but quotes directly from the Hebrew. From it come the following two passages: ‘From Egypt have I called the Son,’ and ‘for this reason was he called the Nazarene’.” –––––––––– * Vide J. P. Migne, P. C.

A few additional passages from the Fathers are brought into the discussion. 61 This quotation is an English rendering of Salomon Munk’s (1803-67) original French text, in his Mélanges de Philosophie Juive et A rabe (Paris: A.

Il nous paraît évident, au contraire, que le compilateur s’est servi de documents anciens, et entre autres de certains Midraschîm , ou recueils de traditions et d’expositions bibliques, que nous ne possédons plus aujourd’hui. . . .” 62 This is a rather misleading reference, seeing that H. P. B. does not quote from any works of Augustus Tholuck (1799-1877) in her te x t above. By referring again to S. Munk’s Mélanges , etc., we find that on the same page 276 he continues in the following manner: “. . . Nous croyons aussi qu’on peut reconnaître dans les sephirôth des analogies frappantes avec les doctrines de certains gnostiques, notamment de Basilide et de Valentinien.” At this point, Munk appends the following footnote: “Cf. Tholuck, l.c., pag. 24 et 31.—Hâya Gaôn, mort en 1038, est à notre connaissance le premier auteur qui développe la théorie des sephirôth, et il leur donne des noms que nous retrouvons plus tard chez les kabbalistes (cf. Jellinek, Moses ben Schem-Tob de Leon , pag. 13, note 5); ce docteur, qui avait de fréquents rapports avec des savants chrétiens syriens ou chaldéens, a pu par ces derniers avoir connaissance de quelques écrits gnostiques.” It is this passage from Tholuck that H. P. B. quotes in its English rendering. By consulting earlier pages of S. Munk’s Mélanges, it would appear that the l.c.

Hundreds of the m ost philosophical minds, scores of` learned well-skilled physicians, have a sked themselves the question, but to little purpose. The veil thrown over primordial Kosmos and the mysterious beginnings of life upon it, has never been withdrawn to the satisfaction of earnest, honest science. The more the men of official learning try to penetrate through its dark folds, the more intense becomes that darkness, and the less they see, for they are like the treasure-hunter, who went across the wide seas to look for that which lay buried in his own garden. What is then this Science? Is it biology, or the study of life in its general aspect? No. Is it physiology, or the science of organic function? Neither; for the former leaves the problem as much the riddle of the Sphinx as ever; and the latter is the science of death far more than that of life. Physiology is based upon the study of the different organic functions and the organs necessary to the manifestations of life, but that which science calls living matter, is, in sober truth, dead matter . Every molecule of the living organs contains the germ of death in itself, and begins dying as soon as born, in order that its successor-molecule should live only to die in its turn. An organ, a natural part of every living being, is but the medium for some special function in life, and is a combination of such molecules. The vital organ, the whole , puts the mask of life on, and thus conceals the constant decay and death of its parts. Thus, neither biology nor physiology are the science, nor even branches of the Science of Life , but only that of` the appearances of life. While true philosophy stands Oedipus-like before the Sphinx of life, hardly daring to utter the paradox contained in the answer to the riddle propounded, materialistic science, as arrogant as ever, never doubting its own wisdom for one moment, biologises itself and many others into the belief that it has solved the awful problem of existence. In T HE S CIENCE OF L IFE   241 truth, however, has it even so muc h as approached its threshold? It is not, surely, by attempting to deceive itself and the unwary in saying that life is but the result of molecular complexity, that it can ever hope to promote the truth. Is vital force, indeed, only a “phantom,” as Du Bois-Reymond calls it? For his taunt that “life,” as something"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"independent, is but the asylum ignorantiae of those who seek refuge in abstractions, when direct explanation is impossible, applies with far more force and justice to those materialists who would blind people to the reality of facts, by substituting bombast and jaw-breaking words in their place. Have any of the five divisions of the functions of life, so pretentiously named—Archebiosis, Biocrosis, Biodiaeresis, Biocaenosis and Bioparodosis*, ever helped a Huxley or a Haeckel to probe more fully the mystery of the generations of the humblest ant—let alone of man? Most certainly not. For life, and everything pertaining to it, belongs to the lawful domain of the metaphysician and psychologist, and physical science has no claim upon it. “That which hath been, is that which shall be; and that which hath been is named already—and it is known that it is MAN”—is the answer to the riddle of the Sphinx. But “man” here, does not refer to physical man—not in its esoteric meaning, at any rate. Scalpels and microscopes may solve the mystery of the material parts of the shell of man : they can never cut a window into his soul to open the smallest vista on any of the wider horizons of being. It is those thinkers alone, who, following the Delphic injunction, have cognized life in their inner selves, those who have studied it thoroughly in themselves, before attempting to trace and analyze its reflection in their outer shells, who are the only ones rewarded with some measure of success. Like the fire-philosophers of the Middle Ages, they have skipped over the appearances of light and fire in the world of effects, and centred their whole attention upon the producing arcane agencies.

Thus they have ascertained that (1) the seemingly living mechanism called physical man, is but the fuel, the material, upon which life feeds, in order to manifest itself; and (2) that thereby the inner man receives as his wage and reward the possibility of accumulating additional experiences of the terrestrial illusions called lives. One of such philosophers is now undeniably the great Russian novelist and reformer, Count Leo N. Tolstoi. How near his views are to the esoteric and philosophical teachings of higher Theosophy, will be found on the perusal of a few fragments from a lecture delivered by him at M OSCOW before the local Psychological Society. Discussing the problem of life , t he Count asks his audience to admit, for the sake of argument, an impossibility . Says the lecturer:— Let us grant for a moment that all that which modern science longs to learn of life, it has learnt, and now knows; that the problem has bec o me as clear as day; that it is clear how organic matter has, by simple adaptation, come to be originated from inorganic material; that it is as clear how natural forces may be transformed into feelings, will, thought, and that finally, all this is known, not only to the city student, but to"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"every village schoolboy, as well.

The answer to the query “How are we to live?” appears so simple to man that he esteems it hardly worth his while to touch upon it. . . . . One must live the best way he can—that’s all. This seems at first sight very simple and well known to all, but it is by far neither as simple nor as well known as one may imagine. . . . The idea of life appears to man in the beginning as a most simple and self-evident business. First of all, it seems to him that life is in himself, in his own body. No sooner, however, does one commence his search"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"after that life, in any one given spot of the said body, than one meets with difficulties. Life is not in the hair, nor in the nails; neither is it in the foot nor the arm, which may both be amputated; it is not in the blood, it is not in the heart, and it is not in the brain. It is everywhere and it is nowhere. It comes to this: life cannot be found in any of its dwelling-places. Then man begins to look for life in Time; and that, too, appears at first a very easy matter. . . . Yet again, no sooner has he started on his chase than he perceives that here also the business is more complicated than he had thought. Now, I have lived fifty-eight years, so says my baptismal church record. But I know that out of these fifty-eight years I slept over twenty. How then? Have I lived all these years, or have I not ? Deduct the months of my gestation, and those I passed in the arms of my nurse, and shall we call this life, also? Again, out of the remaining thirty-eight years, I know that a good half of that time I slept while moving about; and thus, I could no more say in this case, whether I lived during that time or not. I may have lived a little, and vegetated a little. Here again, one finds that in time, as in the body, life is everywhere, yet nowhere. And now the question naturally arises, whence, then, that life which I can trace to nowhere? Now—will I learn.... But it so happens that in this direction also, what seemed to me so easy at first, now seems impossible. I must have been searching for something else, not for my life, assuredly. Therefore, once we have to go in search of the whereabouts of life—if search we have to—then it should be neither in space nor in time, neither as cause nor effect, but as a something which I cognize within myself as quite independent from Space, time and causality. That which remains to do now is to study self. But how do I cognize life in myself? This is how I cognize it. I know, to begin with, that I live; and that I live wishing for myself everything that is good, wishing this since I can remember myself, to this day, and from morn till night. 2 4 4  B L A V A T S K Y : C O L L E C T E D W R I T I N G S A ll that lives outside of myself is important in my eyes but only in so far as it co-operates with the creation of that which is productive of my welf a re. The Universe is important in my sight only because it can give me , pleasure Meanwhile, something e ls e is bound up with this knowledge in me of my existence Inseparable from the life I feel, is another cognition a llied to it; namely, that besides myself, I am surrounded with a whole world of living creatures, possessed, as I am myself, of the same instinctive realization of their exclusive lives; that all these creatures live for their own objects, which objects are foreign to me; that those creatures do not know, nor do they care to know, anything of my pretensions to an exclusive life, and that all these creatures, in order to achieve success in their objects are ready to annihilate me at any moment. But this is not all. While watching the destruction of creatures similar in all to myself, I also know that for me too, for that precious ME in whom alone is represented, a very speedy and inevitable destruction is lying in wait. It is as if there were two “I’s ” in man; it is as if they could never live in peace together; it is as if they were eternally struggling, and ever trying to expel each other One “I” says, “I alone am living as one should live, all the rest only seems to live. Therefore, the whole raison d’être for the universe is in that I may be made comfortable.” The other “I” replies, “The universe is not for thee at all, but for its own aims and purposes, and it cares little to know whether thou art happy or unhappy.” Life becomes a dreadful thing after this! One “I” says, “I only want the gratification of all my wants and desires, and that is why I need the universe.” The other “I” replies, “All animal life lives only for the gratification of its wants and desires. It is the wants and desires of animals alone that are gratified at the expense and detriment of other animals; hence the ceaseless struggle between the animal species. Thou art an animal, and therefore thou hast to struggle Yet, however successful in thy struggle, the rest of the struggling creatures must sooner or later crush thee.” Still worse! life becomes still more dreadful. . . . But the most terrible of all, that which includes in itself the whole of the foregoing, is that"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"One “I” says, “I want to live, to live for ever.” And that the other “I” replies, “Thou shalt surely, perhaps in a few minutes, die; as also shall die all those thou lovest, for thou and they are destroying with every motion your lives, and thus approaching ever nearer suffering, death, all that which thou so hatest, and which thou fearest above anything else.” T HE S CIENCE OF L IFE   245 This is the worst of all. . . . To change this condition is impos s ible. . . . One can avoid moving, sleeping, eating, even breathing, but one cannot escape from thinking. One thinks, and that thought, my thought, is poisoning every step in my life, as a personality. No sooner has man commenced a conscious life than that consciousness repeats to him incessantly without respite, over and over the same thing again “To live such life as you feel and see in your past, the life lived by animals and many men too, lived in that way, which made you become what you are now––is no longer possible Were you to attempt doing so, you could never escape thereby the struggle with all the world of creatures which live as you do-for their personal objects; and then those creatures will inevitably destroy you.” . . . To change this situation is impossible. There remains but one thing to do, and that is always done by him who, beginning to live, transfers his objects in life outside of himself, and aims to reach them. . . . But, however far he places them outside his personality, as his mind gets clearer, none of these objects will satisfy him. Bismarck, having united Germany, and now ruling Europe--if his reason has only thrown any light upon the results of his activity must perceive, as much as his own cook does who prepares a dinner that will be devoured in an hour’s time, the same unsolved contradiction between e vanity and foolishness of all he has done, and the eternity and reasonableness of that which exists for ever If they only think of it, each will see as clearly as the other; firstly , that the preservation of the integrity of Prince Bismarck’s dinner, as well as that of powerful Germany is solely due the preservation of the former––to the police, and the preservation of the latter—to the army; and that, so long only as both keep a good watch. Because there are famished people who would willingly eat the dinner, and nations which would fain be as powerful as Germany. Secondly, that neither Prince Bismarck’s dinner, nor the might of the German Empire, coincide with the aims and purposes of universal life, but that they are in flagrant contradiction with them. And thirdly, that as he who cooked the dinner, so also the might of Germany, will both very soon die, and that so shall perish, and as soon, both the dinner and Germany. That which shall survive alone is the Universe, which will never give one thought to either dinner or Germany, least of all to those who have cooked them. As the intellectual condition of man increases, he comes to the idea that no happiness connected with his personality is an achievement, but only a necessity Personality is only that incipient state from which begins life, and the ultimate limit of life. . . . Where, then, does life begin, and where does it end, I may be asked? Where ends the night, and where does day commence? Where, on 246  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITING S th e shore, ends the domain of the sea, and where does the domain of land begin? There is day and there is nigh t; there is land and there is sea; there is life and there is no life. Our life, ever since we became conscious of it, is a pendulum-like motion between the two limits."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"One limit is, an absolute unconcern for the life of the infinite Universe, an energy directed only toward the gratification of one’s own personality. The other limit is a complete renunciation of that personality, the greatest concern with the life of the infinite Universe, in full accord with it, the transfer of all our desires and good will from one’s self, to that infinite Universe and all the creatures outside of us.* The nearer to the first limit, the less life and bliss, the closer to the second, the more life and bliss. Therefore, man is ever moving from one end to the other; i.e., he lives. T HIS MOTION IS LIFE ITSELF. And when I speak of life, kn o w that the idea of it is indissolubly connected in my conceptions with that of conscious life. No other life is known to me except conscious life, nor can it be known to anyone else. We call life, the life of animals, organic life. But this is no life at all, only a certain state or condition of life manifesting to us. But what is this consciousness or mind, the exigencies of which exclude personality and transfer the energy of man outside of him and into that state which is conceived by us as the blissful state of love? What is conscious mind? Whatsoever we may be defining, we have to define it with our conscious mind. Therefore, with what shall we define mind? . . . If we have to define all with our mind, it follows that conscious mind cannot be defined. Yet all of us, we not only know it, but it is the only thing which is given to us to know undeniably. . . . It is the same law as the law of life, of everything organic, animal or vegetable, with that one difference that we see the consummation of an intelligent law in the life of a plant. But the law of conscious mind, to which we are subjected as the tree is subjected to its law, we see it not, but fulfil it. . . . We have settled that life is that which is not our life. It is herein that lies hidden the root of error. Instead of studying that life of which we are conscious within ourselves, absolutely and exclusively –––––––––– * This is what the Theosophists call “living th e lif e ” — in a n u t- s h e ll. — H . P . B . – ––––––––– T HE S CIENCE OF L IFE   247 —since we can know of nothing else—in order to study it, we observe that which is devoid of the most important factor and faculty of o ur life, namely, intelligent consciousness. By so doing, we act as a man who attempts to study an object by its shadow or reflection does. If we know that substantial particles are subjected during their transformations to the activity of the organism; we know it not because we have observed or studied it, but simply because we possess a certain familiar organism united to us, namely the organism of our animal, which is but too well known to us as the material of our life; i.e., that upon which we are called to work and to rule by subjecting it to the law of reason. . . . No sooner has man lost faith in life, no sooner has he transferred that life into that which is no life, than he becomes wretched, and sees death. . . . A man who conceives life such as he finds it in his consciousness, knows neither misery, nor death: for all the good in life for him is in the subjection of his animal to the law of reason, to do which is not only in his power, but takes place unavoidably in him. The death of particles in the animal being, we know. The death of animals and of man, as an animal, we know; but we know nought about the death of conscious mind, nor can we know anything of it, just because that conscious mind is the very life itself : And Life can never be Death . . . . The animal lives an existence of bliss, neither seeing nor knowing death, and dies without cognizing it. Why then should man have received the gift of seeing and knowing it, and why should death be so terrible to"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"him that it actually tortures his soul, often forcing him to kill himself out of sheer fear of death?

The light lit in the soul of man is bliss and life, and that light can never he darkness, as there exists—verily there exists for man—on]y this solitary light which burns within his soul. –––––––––– We have translated this rather l engthy fragment from the Report of Count Tolstoi’s superb lecture, because it reads like the echo of the finest teachings of the universal ethics of true theosophy. His definition of life in its abstract sense, and of the life every earnest theosophist ought to follow, each according to, and in the measure of, his natural capacities—is the summary and the Alpha and the Omega of practical psychic, if not spiritual life. There are sentences in the lecture which, to the average 248  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS theosophist will seem too hazy, and perhaps incomplete. Not one will he find, however, which could be objected to by th e most exacting, practical occultist. It may be called a treatise on the Alchemy of Soul. For that “solitary” light in man, which burns for ever, and can never be darkness in its intrinsic nature, though the “animal” outside us may remain blind to it—is that “Light” upon which the Neo-Platonists of the Alexandrian school, and after them the Rosecroix and especially the Alchemists, have written volumes, though to the present day their true meaning is a dark mystery to most men True, Count Tolstoi is neither an Alexandrian nor a modern theosophist; still less is he a Rosecroix or an Alchemist. But that which the latter have concealed under the peculiar phraseology of the Fire-philosophers, purposely confusing cosmic transmutations with Spiritual Alchemy, all that is transferred by the great Russian thinker from the realm of the metaphysical unto the field of practical life. That which Schelling would define as a realisation of` the identity of subject and object in the man’s inner Ego, that which unites and blends the latter with the universal Soul which is but the identity of subject and object on a higher plane, or the unknown Deity—all that Count Tolstoi has blended together without quitting the terrestrial plane. He is one of those few elect who begin with intuition and end with quasi -omniscience. It is the transmutations of the baser metals—the animal mass —into gold and silver, or the philosopher’s stone, the development and manifestation of man’s higher S ELF , which the Count has achieved.

S IN A GAINST L IFE   249 To wind up this essay on the Scie n ce of Life , a few words may be said of the eternal riddle propounded to mortals by the Sphinx. To fail to solve the problem contained in it, was to be doomed to sure death, as the Sphinx of life devoured the unintuitional, who would live only in their “animal.” He who lives for Self, and only for Self , will surely die, as the higher “I” tells the lower “animal” in the Lecture. The riddle has seven keys to it, and the Count opens the mystery w-ith one of the highest. For, as the author of Alchemy or the Hermetic Philosophy * beautifully expressed it: “The real mystery most familiar and, at the same time, most unfamiliar to every man , into which he must be initiated or perish as an atheist, is himself . For him is the elixir of life, to quaff which, before the discovery of the philosopher’s stone, is to drink the beverage of death, while it confers on the adept and the epopt , the true immortality. He may know truth as it really is— Aletheia , the breath of God, or Life, the conscious mind in man.” This is “the Alcahest which dissolves all things,” and Count Tolstoi as well understood the riddle.

This work contains a mass of data from a wide range of` sources on the very ancient rite of covenanting by the inter-transfusion of blood. The reviewer takes exception with Dr. Trumbull’s interpretation that the root-idea of this covenanting was that of an “inter-union of the spiritual natures by the inter-commingling of blood for the sake of an inter-communion with deity.” He says: “Dr. Trumbull claims the Egyptians as witnesses to the truth of his interpretation. But so far from their highest conception of ‘a union with the Divine nature’ being an inter-flowing and interfusion of blood, the soul of blood was the very lowest, that is the first, in a series of seven souls! Their highest type of the soul was the sun that vivified for ever, called Atmu, the Father Soul. . . . .

In his novel, Karma, Mr. Sinnett represents one character, Mrs. Lakesby, gifted with more than usual powers, as being very fond, when she has the chance, of allowing her spirit to escape from the trammels of the body and meeting the spirits of departed—that is, dead friends—“and others” on the Astral plane where she holds agreeable converse with them. How are these two statements reconcilable? N.D. October 22nd, 1887. Mr. Sinnett would probably reply that the answer could only be given fully by reprinting all that he has writ t en in various published works, on the conditions of existence in Kama-Loka, and Devachan, and on the higher and lower aspects of Self. The normal course of events will conduct a human being who quits the material body through Kama-Loka to the Devachanic state, in which Mrs. Lakesby would not be able to interview him. But while in Kama-Loka she might at least imagine she did this, and, perhaps not too wisely, indulge in the practice of so doing. If we remember rightly, the Baron T HE R EAL H ISTORY OF THE R OSICRUCIANS  253 in Karma, who is represented a s knowing a good deal more than Mrs. Lakesby, gifted as she is, throws some discredit upon her view concerning the Astral plane and its inhabitants. At the best when a clairvoyant can gain touch with a soul in Kama-Loka, it is the lower self` remaining there, though it has left the body, that she deals with. And though that lower self may be very recognizable for people who have known it in the earthly manifestation, it will be lower than the lower self of earth and not higher because ethereal.

Secret societies supposed to deal with such subjects are, from their point of view, better exposed and ridiculed than treated with respect or taken seriously. The author of the present volume does not, however, cast disrespect on occult science, nor does he discuss the Rosicrucians in a spirit of levity or disdain. He recognises that there may be, and probably is, a grand spiritual and moral philosophy –––––––––– * Arthur Edward Waite, The Real History of the Rosicruc ia ns.

The conscientious study of these records relating to the Brotherhood has brought Mr. Waite to the conclusion that they do not support the traditions which up to the present have surrounded the society with a veil of unknown antiquity and have endowed its members with a halo of marvellous wisdom. It is these conclusions that will charm the incredulous, and may probably blind them to the indications of an undercurrent of belief in the reality of occult science, per se, which the author has evidently not desired to suppress. To investigate and disentangle the network of facts, theories, and traditions which must necessarily envelop a society that up to the commencement of the seventeenth century had not been heard of by the general public is no easy task, and Mr. Waite may be congratulated upon the calm and judicial spirit with which he has treated his subject, as well as upon the moderation with which he advances his own views. To be able to gather from these open records how far the members of such a society may have held in their keeping some of` the inner secrets of Nature is of course impossible to ordinary humanity. The real character and aims of such an association can be known only to passed Initiates. In his preface [p. 4] Mr. Waite says: “I claim that I have performed my task in a sympathetic but impartial manner, purged from the bias of any"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"particular theory, and above all uncontaminated by the pretension to superior knowledge, which claimants have never been able to substantiate.” This statement is fully justified in the pages of the book under review. Its value does not lie so much in any new presentation of the facts or theories pertaining to the Rosicrucians, and which are so frequently distorted by ignorant commentators, as in the compact and systematic arrangement of some of the principal writings available. He has brought together not only the leading works of the various writers known, or supposed to be Rosicrucians, but he has also collected T HE R EAL H ISTORY OF THE R OSICRUCIANS  255 the criticisms and conjectures o n these current at the time of their appearance in Germany, together with others of a much more recent date. Consequently the reader has before him almost all the information of this description he could require, and which he could not obtain for himself except by the expenditure of time and trouble that very few are either able or willing to give. It is not surprising that Mr. Waite should have satisfied himself that the Rosicrucians have no sort of claim to the reverence and admiration in which scholars and mystics have held them up to the present time. But these conclusions will form only one more of other proofs to students of esotericism, that the task of writing a true and real history of a secret occult society from its records, where such exist, is an impossibility. For even when such societies left reliable information of their pursuits, aspirations, and beliefs—the language employed has always been of such a character as to baffle entirely the ordinary exoteric reader, whether he were historian, literateur, or scientist. Such literature can be interesting only to the student on the track of esoteric knowledge, or to one who has in a great measure acquired the meaning conveyed for himself in other ways. This method of giving to the world, as it were, the proceeds, of life-long research in the realms of unseen Nature, has been adopted by alchemists, magicians, priests, and hierophants from all ages. None but those who were sufficiently steadfast in the cause of truth could read and understand what was thus written. The numerous and minute directions for the working of spells and cures, etc., left by Paracelsus, and which are apparently as straightforward and practicable as the receipts in a modern cookery book, would turn out probably much less successful in the hands of an amateur, no matter how highly educated on the physical plane, than the more delicate dishes taken from such receipts manipulated by an entirely inexperienced servant. For these elaborate instructions are given in terms that appeal simply to the material senses of those who are in search of power rather than wisdom, whereas the real effort to produce the result has to take place on 256  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITIN GS "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"the Astral plane of nature. The spiritual or soul side of man, must be awakened and utilised, before the Philosopher’s stone, or the elixir of life, can be discovered. The comprehension of the potentialities of the human body, their nurture and eventual utilisation for purely unselfish ends and spiritual, i.e., real wisdom, is, or ought to be, the work of all secret occult societies. But to return to Mr. Waite’s book. The popular notion that this Brotherhood is of great, almost incredible antiquity, is utterly condemned by him. He fails to find any documentary evidence to show that it existed before the early part of the seventeenth century, and argues that the well-known antiquity of` the Rose and Cross in symbolism is no proof of the antiquity of a society using them “ at a period subsequent to the Renaissance” [p. 210]. Granting that the device of` the Rose and Cross, as emblems of a particular order or brotherhood, does not guarantee its equal antiquity with them, still it must be admitted that these symbols bearing as they do a profoundly esoteric interpretation, and being adopted by a society of a distinctly occult character, is an argument in support of the theory that the founder or originator of this order had some reason other than fancy for thus labelling his fraternity. Elsewhere he says, “I have shown indisputably that there was no novelty in the Rosicrucian pretensions, and no originality in their views. They appear before us as Lutheran disciples of Paracelsus” [p. 209]. The author here seems to be not entirely logical in his deductions. When he states that he has not met in his search with either letters, records, or papers that mention or suggest the existence of such a society before the seventeenth century, he is of course, as a historian, safely ensconced from attack. In this capacity as an impartial seeker after facts, it is outside the area of his work in the absence of data to theorise on probabilities. When, however, in dealing with the manifestoes of the seventeenth century, he finds therein evidence that shows him the Brotherhood has no back history or ancestry, his conclusions are open to criticism. The very fact of the want T HE R EAL H ISTORY OF THE R OSICRUCIANS  257 of originality and novelty in t h e views, aims and aspirations set forth in the Fama, and Confessio surely gives strength to the theory that holds to the antiquity of the society, rather than to its being the outcome of a spontaneous effort. * All true students of mysticism have good reason to believe, even when they do not absolutely know, that the various schools of occultism considered from their highest or most spiritual and abstract teaching, lead to the same goal. They may be called by different names, and their methods in minor details may not be the same, but the wisdom au fond is identical. Therefore when Mr. Waite casts discredit upon the Rosicrucians for not advertising novelties in their manifesto, in the mystical line of thought, he reminds us of a man who in making up his mind on the value of a violin, decides that it cannot be of great age, because it emits only the same set of sounds that such musical instruments have been accustomed to give forth from time immemorial. ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"* [Reference is here made to the two earliest manifestoes anonymously issued at the beginning of the 17th century in Western Europe. One of them was the Fama Fraternitatis (Cassel, 1614 or 1615) which was preceded in the first traceable printed edition by a tract longer than itself and entitled Allgemeine und General Reformation der ganzen weiten Welt (Universal Reformation of the Whole Wide World); the other was the Confessio Fraternitatis (Cassel and Frankfurt, 1615). They first appeared in German, Dutch and Latin, being translated into other languages later on. The theologian Johann Valentin Andreae (1586-1654) acknowledged in his autobiography to have been the author of both the Fama and the Confessio, the appearance of which caused immense excitement throughout Europe. The name of Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, has also been associated with these documents. Interesting information concerning the early Rosicrucian movement may be found in the following two essays: “The Rosicrucians,” by Karl Kisewetter, The Theosophist, Vol. VII, April, 1886, pp. 451-61; and “Christian Rosencreutz and the Rosicrucians,” by W.

A NDREAE .— Compiler .] –––––––––– 258  B LAVATSKY : C OLLE C TED W RITINGS As far as can be ascertained by s t udying the state of thought and society at the period when the Rosicrucians were first heard of in Europe, this particular order manifested itself as an antidote to the general tendency towards the material side of alchemy, which honey-combed the educated classes of Germany. Wonder-seekers then, as now, did not apprehend that ethics, both social and spiritual, are the fundamental basis of real wisdom, consequently the great cry was for power, no matter of what description, for the accumulation of wealth. The craving for arcane knowledge, so widely diffused, and which alchemists were truly known to possess, had gradually degenerated into a purely selfish desire for the secret of transmuting metals. To supply this eager demand, charlatans of every description rushed to the front professing to teach all who joined their standards, i.e., who could pay the necessary fee, how to turn common metal into pure gold. The craze for this power was so universal, the motive of it so unspiritual, that in order to stem the tide of the folly, and to checkmate the impostors who were bringing discredit on the Sacred Art, the Fama was issued by a body of people who took as their symbols the Rose and Cross. From this point of view the Rosicrucians historically come before the world in the light of a group of Reformers. Different people interpret in different ways the two manifestoes—the Fama and Confessio. Mr. Waite appears to place great importance on the adherence to Christian dogmas observable in the wording of these papers. But in taking the documents literally, he seems to overlook the necessity that all writers were under, in those troubled times, of pandering to the narrow and prejudiced minds of the leaders of the so-called Christian Church, by apparently adhering to the Ritual. Naturally, the author of the Fama worded it in such a manner as to avoid persecution or suspicion of heresy. Those to whom it was really addressed would not be misled by its tone of orthodoxy, and the general public and the church would pass it by as harmless. Moreover, as Mr. Waite remarks further on [pp."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"200-01], “the philosophical and scientific T HE R EAL H ISTORY OF THE R OSICRUCIANS  259 opinions and pretentions of th e Rosicrucian Society have more claim on our notice” than their theology. Speaking again of the school of thought current at the time this organisation was floated, and which he tells us the Rosicrucians followed, he says [p. 201]: “Mystics in an age of scientific and religious materialism, they were connected by an unbroken chain with the theurgists of the first Christian centuries; they were alchemists in the spiritual sense and the professors of a divine magic Their disciples, the Rosicrucians, followed closely in their footsteps, and the claims of the Fama and Confessio must be reviewed in the light of the great elder claims of alchemy and magic.” In spite of this, Mr. Waite judges the Society, it would appear, by what he admits to be the minor and less important side of its object, for he speaks of it eventually, as a body of “pre-eminently learned men and a Christian Sect” [p. 216]. We will not stop to consider the probability or possibility of a body of “pre-eminently learned men,” being at the same time a “Christian Sect.” Having thus deprived the Rosicrucians of the dignity, reverence and romance, that cling round great antiquity; having saddled them with the tenets and dogmas of conventional mediaeval Christianity, Mr. Waite next proceeds to demolish their emblems, or at all events, to deny that they attached any esoteric interpretation to them. He says: “. . . the whole question of the significance of the Crucified Rose, in its connection with the society, is one of pure conjecture, that no Rosicrucian manifestoes, and no acknowledged Brother have ever given any explanation concerning it, and that no presumption is afforded by the fact of its adoption for the antiquity of the society or for its connection with universal symbolism” [p. 24]. Allowing for the necessity in writing a history of a mystical society of taking the documents as they stand, Mr. Waite rather ignores the fact that the evidence for the statement above is of a negative character. That in their manifestoes and records there appears no explanation of their emblems, hardly justifies the conclusion that they were incapable of giving any. 260  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS It would indeed have been a new d e parture in the annals of Secret Societies if the founders of this particular order had left behind the explanation of their signs and symbols. The study and interpretation of symbology forms a most important element in the education of occult disciples, and therefore to assume that the projectors of this organisation should be unaware of the mystic reading of` the Rose and Cross, is a hypothesis that no student of mysticism could accept. It is, on the whole, generally assumed by those who have taken any pains to investigate"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"the evidence, that Johann Valentin Andreae * was the author of the Fama, the Confessio Fraternitatis, and also of the Chymical Marriage of Christian Rosencreutz, and to that extent he must be looked upon exoterically as the founder of the Rosicrucian Society, as first known to history. He was deeply versed in mystic studies and alchemy, and had besides a widespread reputation as a scholar and learned man. His Chymical Marriage, to anyone with even a slight acquaintance with alchemical literature, reveals him as one who had penetrated deeply into some of the mysteries of nature. Consequently, he must have been well aware that the Rose and Cross bore a profoundly occult signification. Considering the man himself, the character of his studies, and his well-known devotion to alchemy and mysticism, it is certainly more reasonable to suppose that he took those emblems (presuming he had any choice in the matter) for his society, not as some suggest, because they happened to form a part of his own armorial bearings, or that the Rose and Cross on a Heart was used by Martin Luther, but because he recognized their full value and importance as symbols of cosmic evolution. Mr. Waite seems, on the whole, to agree with the idea that Andreae was the author of the Fama and Confessio, and regards the Chymical Marriage as undoubtedly his production. He also allows that the latter pamphlet can only have been the work of a man deeply imbued with –––––––– * [ V ide B io-Bibliogr. Index, s.v.

How then can he ask us to believe that the Society formed under such auspices was au fond , nothing but a Christian sect based on the teachings of Martin Luther! To the public at large these theories may perhaps appear sufficiently plausible in face of the wording of those parts of the manifestoes that touch on theology. To students of esotericism, however, such conclusions will be absolutely unacceptable, and we cannot allow to pass without comment Mr. Waite’s hypothesis that the Rosicrucian Society, as it first came before the world, was simply a society for the propagation of the deteriorated Christianity of the middle ages. No mystic, whether calling himself Rosicrucian, Cabbalist, Theosophist, Christian, or Buddhist, would either intellectually or spiritually accept the narrow dogmas and intolerant views of the Christian church, even when to some extent cleansed of many of its grosser abuses by the energy of Martin Luther’s Reform. The two lines of thought are essentially different. In the case of the Christian, no matter of what denomination, his thoughts are bound down and paralysed within the rigid circle e drawn by the materialistic reading of Christ’s birth, life, and death. The true occultist takes those episodes spiritually or allegorically, finding their correspondences within himself as well as in the universe.

A true Christian, i.e., one who understood and followed absolutely the teachings of Jesus, would be also a true Rosicrucian. Membership of particular churches or societies does not unfortunately endow the individual immediately with the virtue, knowledge or power, that is the theoretical goal of his initial action. Such membership is, or may be, a step in the direction of Divine Wisdom, but one step does not carry him to the summit of the path. Men do not become either Rosicrucians, Christians, or Theosophists merely by joining the Societies working under those particular names. But certain tendencies in their temperaments 262  BLAVATSK Y: COLLECT ED WRITIN GS urge them into the special Soci e ty where the mode of thought seems best fitted to help them, to realise the magnitude and glory of the possibilities inherent in their own souls. Between the humanity of to-day, and the development of a sixth sense, which will enable it to perceive what now is imperceptible, there is but a thin veil of obstructing matter, metaphorically speaking. This veil is even now being continually pierced by psychics, first in one direction, then in another, letting in through these tiny openings glimpses of the invisible world around. In a little while the veil will be worn away entirely, and the humanity of that future time will doubtless wonder how the humanity of this age, which we find so enlightened, could have been so unintuitive and blind to the most important side of their natures. Until the race however has by soul evolution attained to this sixth sense, real histories of Mystical Societies can hardly be hoped for. Members of such Societies, who by study and training have attained some degree of knowledge may not disclose the secrets, non-members cannot get at them. The reading-classes of to-day may, after reading Mr. Waite’s book, think they have learnt something of the body of people called Rosicrucians, and until now supposed to have some claim to arcane knowledge. The students of occultism will know that the vital part of the subject is and must remain ever impregnable, excepting from its esoteric side. ––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME VIII November, 1887 FROM THE NOTE BOOK OF AN UNPOPULAR PHILOSOPHER [ Lucifer , Vol. I, No. 3, November, 1887, pp. 239-240] I am sternly rebuked for some r emarks made in the last number.

Well may a “heathen Chinee” or a “mild Hindu” shudder in horror at the picture in it of` that “drawing of` blood” out of the baby-bodies of infant thieves. The process is executed by a Christian policeman acting under the orders and in the presence of a righteous Christian magistrate. Has either of the two ever given a thought during the “child-torture” to the words of their Christ: “ And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believes in me, it is better for him that a 266  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS millstone were hanged about hi s neck, and he were cast into the sea ”? [Mark, ix, 42.] Yes, they are walking “in the ways of the God of Israel”! For, as “ it repenteth ” the Lord that he had made man so wicked and so imperfect, that “Lord” drowned and destroyed him “from the face of the earth,” without more ado. Verily so, “ both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air ” [ Gen ., vi, 7], though the latter had neither sinned, nor were they “wicked.” And why shouldn’t the righteous men on Earth do likewise? It repents the Christian citizens of pious L UGDUNUM perchance also, that they create the starving little wre t ches, the foundlings abandoned to vice from the day of their birth? And the truly good Christian men, who would believe themselves damned to hell-fire were they to miss their Sabbath Service, forbidden by law to drown their creatures, resort to the next best thing they can; they “draw blood” from those little ones whom their “Saviour” and Master took under his special protection. May the shadow of “Saladin” never grow less, for the fearless honest words of truth he writes:— And whose blood was in the veins of these two boys? Whose blood reddened the twigs of the birch? Peradventure that of the magistr a te himself, or of the chaplain of the prison. For mystical are the grinding of the wheels of the mill of misery. And God looks on and tolerates. And I am accounted a heretic, and my anti-Christian writings are produced against me in a Court of Justice to prevent my getting justice, because I fail to see in all this how Christianity “elevates” woman and casts a “halo of sacred innocence round the"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"tender years of the child.” So be it. I have flung down my gauge of battle, and the force of bigotry may break me to death, but it shall never bend me to submission. Unsalaried and ill-supported, I fight as stubbornly as if the world flung at my feet its gold and laurels and huzzas; for the weak need a champion and the wronged an avenger. It is necessary that Sham find an opponent and Hypocrisy a foe: these they will find in me, be the consequences what they may. SALADIN. * –––––––––– * [Pseudonym of William Steward Ross.

Your Grace is no doubt aware that Theosophy is not a religion, but a philosophy at once religious and scientific; and that the chief work, so far, of the Theosophical Society has been to revive in each religion its own animating spirit, by encouraging and helping enquiry into the true significance of its doctrines and observances. Theosophists know that the deeper one penetrates into the meaning of the dogmas and ceremonies of all religions, the greater becomes their apparent underlying similarity, until finally a perception of their fundamental unity is reached. This common ground is no other than Theosophy—the Secret Doctrine of the ages; which, diluted and –––––––––– * [There is some doubt as to the authorship of this famous pronouncement.

The Theosophical Society has branches respectively composed of Buddhists, Hindoos, Mohammedans, Parsees, Christians and Freethinkers, who work together as brethren on the common ground of Theosophy; and it is precisely because Theosophy is not a religion, nor can for the multitude supply the place of a religion, that the success of the Society has been so great, not merely as regards its growing membership and extending influence, but also in respect to the performance of the work it has undertaken—the revival of spirituality in religion, and the cultivation of the sentiment of BROTHERHOOD among men. We Theosophists believe that a religion is a natural incident in the life of man in his present stage of"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"development; and that although, in rare cases, individuals may be born without the religious sentiment, a community must have a religion, that is to say, a uniting bond —under penalty of social decay and material annihilation. We believe that no religious doctrine can be more than an attempt to picture to our present limited understandings, in the terms of our terrestrial experiences, great cosmical and spiritual truths, which in our normal state of consciousness we vaguely sense , rather than actually perceive and comprehend; and a revelation, if it is to reveal anything, must necessarily conform to the same earthbound requirements of the human intellect. In our estimation, therefore, no religion can be absolutely true, and none can be absolutely false. A religion is true in. proportion as it supplies the spiritual, moral and intellectual needs of the time, and helps the development of mankind in these respects. It is false in proportion as it hinders that development, and offends the spiritual, moral and intellectual portion of man’s nature. And the transcendentally spiritual ideas of the ruling powers of the Universe entertained by an Oriental sage would be as false a religion for the African savage as the grovelling fetishism of the latter would be for the sage, although both views must necessarily be true in degree, for both 270  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS represent the highest ideas attainable by the respective individuals of the same cosmico-spiritual facts, which can never be known in their reality by man while he remains but man. Theosophists, therefore, are respecters of all the religions, and for the religious ethics of` Jesus they have profound admiration. It could not be otherwise, for these teachings which have come down to us are the same as those of Theosophy. So far, therefore, as modern Christianity makes good its claim to be the practical religion taught by Jesus, Theosophists are with it heart and hand. So far as it goes contrary to those ethics, pure and simple, Theosophists are its opponents. Any Christian can, if he will, compare the Sermon on the Mount with the dogmas of his church, and the spirit that breathes in it, with the principles that animate this Christian civilisation and govern his own life; and then he will be able to judge for himself how far the religion of Jesus enters into his Christianity, and how far, therefore, he and Theosophists are agreed. But professing Christians, especially the clergy, shrink from making this comparison. Like merchants who fear to find themselves bankrupt, they seem . to dread the discovery of a discrepancy in their accounts which could not be made good by placing material assets as a set-off to spiritual liabilities. The comparison between the teachings of Jesus and the doctrines of the churches has, however frequently been made—and often with great learning and critical acumen—both by those who would abolish Christianity and those who would reform it; and the aggregate result of these comparisons, as your Grace must be well aware, goes to prove that in almost every point the doctrines of the churches and the practices of Christians are in direct opposition to the teachings of Jesus. We are accustomed to say to the Buddhist, the Mohammedan, the Hindoo, or the Parsee: “The road to Theosophy lies, for you, through your own religion.” We say this because those creeds possess a deeply philosophical and esoteric meaning, explanatory of the allegories under which they are presented to the people; but we cannot TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY  271 say the same thing to Christians. The successors of the Apostles never recorded the secret doctrine of Jesus—the “mysteries of the kingdom of heaven”—which it was given to them (his apostles) alone to know.* These have been suppressed, made away with, destroyed. What have come down upon the stream of time are the maxims, the parables, the allegories and the fables w-hichJesus expressly intended for the spiritually deaf and blind to be revealed later to the world, and which modern Christianity either takes all literally, or interprets according to the fancies of the Fathers of the secular church. In both cases they are like cut flowers: they are severed from the plant on which they grew, and from the root whence that plant drew its life. Were we, therefore, to encourage Christians, as we do the votaries of other creeds, to study their own religion for"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"themselves, the consequence would be, not a knowledge of the meaning of its mysteries, but either the revival of mediaeval superstition and intolerance, accompanied by a formidable outbreak of mere lip-prayer and preaching—such as resulted in the formation of the 239 Protestant sects of England alone—or else a great increase of scepticism, for Christianity has no esoteric foundation known to those who profess it. For even you, my Lord Primate of England, must be painfully aware that you know absolutely no more of those “mysteries of the kingdom of heaven” which Jesus taught his disciples, than does the humblest and most illiterate member of your church. It is easily understood, therefore, that Theosophists have nothing to say against the policy of the Roman Catholic Church in forbidding, or of the Protestant churches in discouraging, any such private enquiry into the meaning of the “Christian” dogmas as would correspond to the esoteric study of other religions. With their present ideas and knowledge, professing Christians are not prepared to undertake a critical examination of their faith, with a promise of good results. Its inevitable effect would be –––––––––– * Mark , iv, 11; Matthew , xiii, 11; Luke , viii, 10. –––––––––– 272  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS to paralyze rather than stimulate their dormant religious sentiments; for biblical criticism and comparative mythology have proved conclusively—to those, at least, who have no vested interests, spiritual or temporal, in the maintenance of orthodoxy—that the Christian religion, as it now exists, is composed of the husks of` Judaism, the shreds of paganism, and the ill-digested remains of gnosticism and neo-platonism. This curious conglomerate which gradually formed itself round the recorded sayings ( ` ) of Jesus, has, after the lapse of ages, now begun to disintegrate, and to crumble away from the pure and precious gems of Theosophic truth which it has so long overlain and hidden, but could neither disfigure nor destroy. Theosophy not only rescues these precious gems from the fate that threatens the rubbish in which they have been so long embedded, but saves that rubbish itself from utter condemnation; for it shows that the result of biblical criticism is far from being the ultimate analysis of Christianity, as each of the pieces which compose the curious mosaics of the Churches once belonged to a religion which had an esoteric meaning. It is only when these pieces arc restored to the places they originally occupied that their hidden significance can be perceived, and the real meaning of the dogmas of Christianity understood. To do all this, however, requires a knowledge of the Secret Doctrine as it exists in the esoteric foundation of other religions; and this knowledge is not in the hands of the Clergy, for the Church has hidden, and since lost, the keys. Your Grace will now understand why it is that the Theosophical Society has taken for one of its three “objects” the study of those Eastern religions and philosophies, which shed such a flood of light upon the inner meaning of Christianity; and you will, we hope, also perceive that in so doing, we are acting not as the enemies, but as the friends of the religion taught by Jesus—of true Christianity, in fact. For it is only through the study of those religions and philosophies that Christians can ever arrive at an understanding of their own beliefs, or see the hidden meaning of the parables and TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY  273 allegories which the Nazarene told to the spiritual cripples of Judea, and by taking which, either as matters of fact or as matters of fancy, the Churches have brought the teachings themselves into ridicule and contempt, and Christianity into serious danger of complete collapse, undermined as it is by historical criticism and mythological research, besides being broken by the sledge-hammer of modern science. Ought Theosophists themselves, then, to be regarded by Christians as their enemies, because they believe that orthodox Christianity is, on the whole, opposed to the religion of Jesus; and because they have the"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"courage to tell the Churches that they are traitors to the MASTER they profess to revere and serve? Far from it, indeed. Theosophists know that the same spirit that animated the words of Jesus lies latent in the hearts of Christians, as it does naturally in all men’s hearts. Their fundamental tenet is the Brotherhood of Man, the ultimate realisation of which is alone made possible by that which was known long before the days of Jesus as “ the Christ spirit.” This spirit is even now potentially present in all men, and it will be developed into activity when human beings are no longer prevented from understanding, appreciating and sympathising with one another by the barriers of strife and hatred erected by priests and princes. We know that Christians in their lives frequently rise above the level of their Christianity. All Churches contain many noble, self-sacrificing, and virtuous men and women, eager to do good in their generation according to their lights and opportunities, and full of aspirations to higher things than those of earth—followers of` Jesus in spite of their Christianity. For such as these Theosophists feel the deepest sympathy; for only a Theosophist, or else a person of` your Grace’s delicate sensibility and great theological learning, can justly appreciate the tremendous difficulties with which the tender plant of natural piety has to contend, as it forces its root into the uncongenial soil of our Christian civilization, and tries to blossom in the cold and arid atmosphere of theology. How hard, for instance, must it not be to “love” such a God as 274  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS that depicted in a well-known passage by Herbert Spencer: The cruelty of a Fijian god who, represented as devouring the souls of the dead, may be supposed to inflict torture during the process, is small compared with the cruelty of a god who condemns men to tortures which are eternal. . . . . . The visiting on Adam’s descendants through hundreds of generations dreadful penalties for a small transgression which they did not commit; the damning of all men who do not avail themselves of an alleged mode of obtaining forgiveness, which most men have never heard of; and the effecting a reconciliation by sacrificing a son who was perfectly innocent, to satisfy the assumed necessity for a propitiatory victim; are modes of action which, ascribed to a human ruler, would call forth expressions of abhorrence. . . * Your Grace will say, no doubt, that Jesus never taught the worship of such a god as that. Even so say we Theosophists. Yet that is the very god whose worship is officially conducted in Canterbury Cathedral, by you, my Lord Primate of England; and your Grace will surely agree with us that there must indeed be a divine spark of religious intuition in the hearts of men, that enables them to resist so well as they do, the deadly action of such poisonous theology. If your Grace, from your high pinnacle, will cast your eyes around, you will behold a Christian civilization in which a frantic and merciless battle of man against man is not only the distinguishing feature, but the acknowledged principle. It is an accepted scientific and economic axiom to-day, that all progress is achieved through the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest; and the fittest to survive in this Christian civilization are not those who are possessed of the qualities that are recognised by the morality of every age to be the best—not the generous, the pious, the noble-hearted, the forgiving, the humble, the truthful, the honest, and the kind—but those who are strongest in selfishness, in craft, in hypocrisy, in brute force, in false pretence, in unscrupulousness, in cruelty, and in avarice.

Does religion put a stop to the battle? Do the churches drive away the vultures, or comfort the wounded and the dying? Religion does not weigh a feather in the world at large to-day, when worldly advantage and selfish pleasures are put in the other scale; and the churches are powerless to revivify the religious sentiment among men, because their ideas, their knowledge, their methods, and their arguments are those of the Dark Ages. My Lord Primate, your Christianity is five hundred years behind the times. So long as men disputed whether this god or that god was the true one, or whether the soul went to this place or that one after death, you, the clergy, understood the question, and had arguments at hand to influence opinion—by syllogism or torture, as the case might require; but now it is the existence of any such being as God, at all, or of any kind of immortal spirit, that is questioned or denied. Science invents new theories of the Universe which contemptuously ignore the existence of any god; moralists establish theories of ethics and social life in which the non-existence of a future life is taken for granted; in physics, in psychology, in law, in medicine, the one thing needful in order to entitle any teacher to a hearing is that no reference whatever should be contained in his ideas either to a Providence, or to a soul. The world is being rapidly brought to the conviction that god is a mythical conception, which has no foundation in fact, or place in Nature; and that the immortal part of man is the silly dream of ignorant savages perpetuated by the lies and tricks of priests, who reap a harvest by cultivating the fears of men that their mythical God will torture their imaginary souls to all eternity, in a fabulous Hell. In the face of all these things the clergy 276  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS stand in this age dumb and powerless. The only answer which the Church knew how to make to such “objections” as these, were the rack and the faggot; and she cannot use that system of logic now. It is plain that if the God and the soul taught by the churches be imaginary entities, then the Christian salvation and damnation are mere delusions of the mind, produced by the hypnotic process of assertion and suggestion on a magnificent scale, acting cumulatively on generations of mild “hysteriacs.” What answer have you to such a theory of the Christian religion, except a repetition of assertions and suggestions? What ways have you of bringing men back to their old beliefs but by reviving their old habits? “Build more churches, say more prayers, establish more missions, and your faith in damnation and salvation will be revived, and a renewed belief in God and the soul will be the necessary result.” That is the policy of the churches, and their only answer to agnosticism and materialism. But your Grace must know that to meet the attacks of modern science and criticism with such weapons as assertion and habit, is like going forth against magazine guns, armed with boomerangs and leather shields. While, however, the progress of ideas and the increase of knowledge are undermining the popular theology, every discovery of science, every new conception of European advanced thought, brings the 19th century mind nearer to the ideas of the Divine and the Spiritual, known to all esoteric religions and to Theosophy. The Church claims that Christianity is the only true religion, and this claim involves two distinct propositions, namely, that Christianity is true religion, and that there is no true religion except Christianity. It never seems to strike Christians that God and Spirit could possibly exist in any other form than that under which they are presented in the doctrines of their church. The savage calls the missionary an Atheist, because he does not carry an idol in his trunk; and the missionary, in his turn, calls everyone an Atheist who does not carry about a fetish in his mind; and neither savage nor Christian ever TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY  277 seem to suspect that there may be a higher idea than their own of the great hidden power that governs the Universe, to which the name of “God” is much more applicable. It is doubtful whether the churches take more pains to prove Christianity “true,” or to prove that any other kind of religion is necessarily “false”; and"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"the evil consequences of this, their teaching, are terrible. When people discard dogma they fancy that they have discarded the religious sentiment also, and they conclude that religion is a superfluity in human life—a rendering to the clouds of things that belong to earth, a waste of energy which could be more profitably expended in the struggle for existence. The materialism of this age is, therefore, the direct consequence of the Christian doctrine that there is no ruling power in the Universe, and no immortal Spirit in man except those made known in Christian dogmas. The Atheist, my Lord Primate, is the bastard son of` the Church. But this is not all. The churches have never taught men any other or higher reason why they should be just and kind and true than the hope of reward and the fear of punishment, and when they let go their belief in Divine caprice and Divine injustice the foundations of` their morality are sapped. They have not even natural morality to consciously fall back upon, for Christianity has taught them to regard it as worthless on account of the natural depravity of man. Therefore self-interest becomes the only motive for conduct, and the fear of being found out, the only deterrent from vice. And so, with regard to morality as well as to God and the soul, Christianity pushes men off the path that leads to knowledge, and precipitates them into the abyss of incredulity, pessimism and vice. The last place where men would now look for help from the evils and miseries of life is the Church because they know that the building of churches and the repeating of litanies influence neither the powers of Nature nor the councils of nations; because they instinctively feel that when the churches accepted the principle of expediency they lost their power to move the hearts of men, and can now only act on the external 278  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS plane, as the supporters of the policeman and the politician. The function of religion is to comfort and encourage humanity in its life-long struggle with sin and sorrow. This it can do only by presenting mankind with noble ideals of a happier existence after death, and of a worthier life on earth, to be won in both cases by conscious effort. What the world now wants is a Church that will tell it of Deity, or the immortal principle in man, which will be at least on a level with the ideas and knowledge of the times. Dogmatic Christianity is not suited for a world that reasons and thinks, and only those who can throw themselves into a mediaeval state of mind, can appreciate a Church whose religious (as distinguished from its social and political) function is to keep God in good humour while the laity are doing what they believe he does not approve; to pray for changes of weather; and occasionally, to thank the Almighty for helping to slaughter the enemy. It is not “medicine men,” but spiritual guides that the world looks for today—a “clergy” that will give it ideals as suited to the intellect of this century, as the Christian Heaven and Hell, God and the Devil, were to the ages of dark ignorance and superstition. Do, or can, the Christian clergy fulfil this requirement? The misery, the crime, the vice, the selfishness, the brutality, the lack of self-respect and self-control, that mark our modern civilization, unite their voices in one tremendous cry, and answer—NO! What is the meaning of the reaction against materialism, the signs of which fill the air today? It means that the world has become mortally sick of the dogmatism, the arrogance, the self-sufficiency, and the spiritual blindness of modern science of that same Modern Science which men but yesterday hailed as their deliverer from religious bigotry and Christian superstition, but which, like the Devil of the monkish legends, requires, as the price of its services, the sacrifice of man’s immortal soul. And meanwhile, what are the Churches doing? The Churches are sleeping the sweet sleep of endowments, of social and political influence, while the world, the flesh, and the TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY  279 devil, are appropriating their watchwords, their miracles, their arguments, and their blind faith. The Spiritualists—oh! Churches of Christ—have stolen the fire from your altars to illumine their séance rooms; the Salvationists have taken your sacramental wine, and make themselves spiritually drunk in the streets; the"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Infidel has stolen the weapons with which you vanquished him once, and triumphantly tells you that “What you advance, has been frequently said before.” Had ever clergy so splendid an opportunity? The grapes in the vineyard are ripe, needing only the right labourers to gather them. Were you to give to the world some proof, on the level of the present intellectual standard of probability, that Deity—the immortal Spirit in man—have a real existence as facts in Nature, would not men hail you as their saviour from pessimism and despair, from the maddening and brutalizing thought that there is no other destiny for man but an eternal blank, after a few short years of bitter toil and sorrow?—aye; as their saviours from the panic-stricken fight for material enjoyment and worldly advancement, which is the direct consequence of believing this mortal life to be the be-all and end-all of existence? But the Churches have neither the knowledge nor the faith needed to save the world, and perhaps your Church, my Lord Primate, least of all, with the mill-stone of £8,000,000 a year hung round its neck. In vain you try to lighten the ship by casting overboard the ballast of doctrines which your forefathers deemed vital to Christianity. What more can your Church do now, than run before the gale with bare poles, while the clergy feebly endeavour to putty up the gaping leaks with the “revised version,” and by their social and political deadweight try to prevent the ship from capsizing, and its cargo of dogmas and endowments from going to the bottom? Who built Canterbury Cathedral, my Lord Primate? Who invented and gave life to the great ecclesiastical organisation which makes an Archbishop of Canterbury possible? Who laid the foundation of the vast system of religious taxation which gives you £15,000 a year and a palace? Who instituted the forms and ceremonies, the 280  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS prayers and litanies, which, slightly altered and stripped of art and ornament, make the liturgy of the Church of England? Who wrested from the people the proud titles of “reverend divine” and “Man of God” which the clergy of your Church so confidently assume? Who, indeed, but the Church of Rome! We speak in no spirit of enmity. Theosophy has seen the rise and fall of many faiths, and will be present at the birth and death of many more. We know that the lives of religions are subject to law. Whether you inherited legitimately from the Church of Rome, or obtained by violence, we leave you to settle with your enemies and with your conscience; for mental attitude towards your Church is determined by its intrinsic worthiness. We know that if it be unable to fulfil the true spiritual function of a religion, it will surely be swept away, even though the fault lie rather in its hereditary tendencies, or in its environments, than in itself. The Church of England, to use a homely simile, is like a train running by the momentum it acquired before steam was shut off. When it left the main track, it got upon a siding that leads nowhere. The train has nearly come to a standstill, and many of the passengers have left it for other conveyances. Those that remain are for the most part aware that they have been depending all along upon what little steam was left in the boiler when the fires of Rome were withdrawn from under it. They suspect that they may be only playing at train now; but the engineer keeps blowing his whistle and the guard goes round to examine the tickets, and the breaksmen rattle their breaks, and it is not such bad fun after all. For the carriages are warm and comfortable and the day is cold, and so long as they are tipped all the company’s servants are very obliging. But those who know where they want to go, are not so contented. For several centuries the Church of England has performed the difficult feat of blowing hot and cold in two directions at once—saying to the Roman Catholics “Reason!” and to the Sceptics “Believe!” It was by adjusting the force of its two-faced blowing, that it has managed to keep itself so long from falling off the fence. TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY  281 But now the fence itself is giving way. Disendowment and disestablishment are in the air. And what does"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"your Church urge in its own behalf? Its usefulness. It is useful to have a number of educated, moral, unworldly men, scattered all over the country, who prevent the world from utterly forgetting the name of religion, and who act as centres of benevolent work. But the question now is no longer one of repeating prayers, and giving alms to the poor, as it was five hundred years ago. The people have come of age, and have taken their thinking and the direction of their social, private and even spiritual affairs into their own hands, for they have found out that their clergy know no more about “things of Heaven” than they do themselves. But the Church of England, it is said, has become so liberal that all ought to support it. Truly, one can go to an excellent imitation of the mass, or sit under a virtual Unitarian, and still be within its fold. This beautiful tolerance, however, only means that the Church has found it necessary to make itself an open common, where every one can put up his own booth, and give his special performance if he will only join in the defence of the endowments. Tolerance and liberality are contrary to the laws of the existence of any church that believes in divine damnation, and their appearance in the Church of England is not a sign of renewed life, but of approaching disintegration. No less deceptive is the energy evinced by the Church in the building of churches. If this were a measure of religion what a pious age this would be! Never was dogma so well housed before, though human beings may have to sleep by thousands in the streets, and to literally starve in the shadow of our majestic cathedrals, built in the name of Him who had not where to lay His head. But did Jesus tell you, your Grace, that religion lay not in the hearts of men, but in temples made with hands? You cannot convert your piety into stone and use it in your lives; and history shows that petrifaction of the religious sentiment is as deadly a disease as ossification of the heart. Were churches, however, multiplied a hundred fold, and were every clergyman to become a 282  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS centre of philanthropy, it would only be substituting the work that the poor require from their fellow men but not from their spiritual teachers, for that which they ask and cannot obtain. It would but bring into greater relief the spiritual barrenness of the doctrines of the Church. The time is approaching when the clergy will be called upon to render an account of their stewardship. Are you prepared, my Lord Primate, to explain to YOUR MASTER why you have given His children stones, when they cried to you for bread? You smile in your fancied security. The servants have kept high carnival so long in the inner chambers of the Lord’s house, that they think He will surely never return. But He told you He would come as a thief in the night; and lo! He is coming already in the hearts of men. He is coming to take possession of His Father’s kingdom there, where alone His kingdom is. But you know Him not! Were the Churches themselves not carried away in the flood of negation and materialism which has engulfed Society, they would recognise the quickly growing germ of the Christ-spirit in the hearts of thousands, whom they now brand as infidels and madmen. They would recognise there the same spirit of love, of self-sacrifice, of immense pity for the ignorance, the folly, and the sufferings of the world, which appeared in its purity in the heart of Jesus, as it had appeared in the hearts of other Holy Reformers in other ages; and which is the light of all true religion, and the lamp by which the Theosophists of all times have endeavoured to guide their steps along the narrow path that leads to salvation—the path which is trodden by every incarnation of CHRISTOS or the SPIRIT OF TRUTH. And now, my Lord Primate, we have very respectfully laid before you the principal points of difference and disagreement between Theosophy and the Christian Churches, and told you of the oneness of Theosophy and the teachings of Jesus. You have heard our profession of faith, and learned the grievances and plaints which we lay at the door of dogmatic Christianity.

Or may we hope that the bitter lessons of experience, which that policy has afforded the Churches in the past, will have altered the hearts and cleared the understandings of her rulers; and that the coming year, 1888, will witness the stretching out to us of the hand of Christians in fellowship and goodwill? This would only be a just recognition that the comparatively small body called the Theosophical Society is no pioneer of the Anti-Christ, no brood of the Evil one, but the practical helper, perchance the saviour, of Christianity, and that it is only endeavouring to do the work that Jesus, like Buddha, and the other “sons of God” who preceded him, has commanded all his followers to undertake, but which the Churches, having become dogmatic, are entirely unable to accomplish.

Captain Serjeant’s views excite much interest among a large number of earnest people, who use Biblical forms and phraseology to picture to themselves the hidden things of nature and of spirit—things which w e, the editors, and also the large majority of Theosophists, believe to be more clearly conveyed under the symbolism of the ancient Wisdom-Religion of the East, and better expressed in its terminology. The article is an attempt to explain the significance of a very curious cloud formation observed by many persons in Scotland, on the 16th of September last, a sketch of which appeared in the St. Stephen’s Review on the 24th of the same month. In the centre of the sketch appears a side view of the British Lion rampant, with his paw on the head of a bearded man, who bears a considerable likeness to Mr. Parnell; to the right of the Lion is an excellent likeness of Her Majesty, crowned, as in the Jubilee coinage, and smiling very naturally; and to the left of the picture is an Irish harp. The appearance, by the testimony of many witnesses, must have been remarkably perfect and striking. Cloud-forms of a similar kind have been recorded many times in history, and they are usually connected in the public mind with some important political event. The Cross of Constantine will, no doubt, recur to the readers’ mind, but the sword and reversed crescent, which everyone saw in the sky when the Turks were driven out of Vienna, may be less generally known; as also the reversed thistles, with the outline of a Scotchman, armed with claymore and targe, and falling backward, which was observed in the clouds by the King and G OD S PEAKS FOR L AW AND O RDER  285 Court at Windsor on the night be f ore the battle of Culloden.* The question of what interpretation is to be put upon remarkable cloud appearances, is of little interest to anyone who believes that such phenomena are merely accidental arrangements of the watery vapours of the atmosphere driven by currents of air. Apart,"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"however, from the obvious consideration that this way of regarding the phenomenon only raises the further question of what causes the currents of air to run in these particular ways, it may be safely said that the chances are millions of millions of millions to one, against the appearance in the clouds of any such perfect and complete picture of well-known persons and emblems, as were seen in Scotland on the 16th of September. Of course it may be argued, on the other hand, that the clouds are for ever forming and re-forming in millions of millions of millions different ways, and that the mathematical chances are that one of these ways will occasionally represent an earth scene. But even if the infinite number of continual permutations and transformations of cloud substance be held to account for the occasional appearance of some graphic picture of human things, it does not in any way explain why these rare pictures, when they do occur, should be perfect and appropriate symbols; neither does it account for their appearance at the particular moment when the extraordinary events, to which they are appropriate, are occurring, or about to occur. The phenomenon of vapours and fumes taking the shape of persons and things, is one of the oldest and best accredited facts in magic, and these cloud appearances, if they be viewed as having any significance are merely instances of a similar action on a large scale produced by some conscious or unconscious force in nature. If it be allowed, however, that the occasional assumption by vapours of the shapes and likenesses of terrestrial –––––––––– * [Fought April 16, 1738, near Inverness, Scotland, when the Jacobites were totally defeated by the Duke of Cumberland.

Should the lion, the harp, her Majesty, and Mr. Parnell, of the Scottish cloud-picture, be taken as having any more significance in the affairs of the nation, or of the world at large, than chemical phenomena can be supposed to presage disturbances or rejoicings in the world of nature? To answer this question would involve considerations which only an advanced Occultist would be able to comprehend; so we shall merely say, that although there are natural symbols which carry in them a definite meaning for those who can read that secret language, still symbols are generally significant in proportion as people themselves put a significance into them. A triangle or a cube is nothing but a triangle or a cube to a yokel, but to an Occultist they contain the philosophy of the Universe.

The Editors of Lucifer would confer a great be n efit on those who are attracted to the movement which they advocate, if they would state: (1.) Whether a would-be-theosophist-occultist is required to abandon his worldly ties and duties such as family affection, love of parents, wife, children, friends, etc.? I ask this question because it is rumoured here that some theosophical publications have so stated, and would wish to know whether such a sine qua non condition really exists in your Rules ? The same, however, is found in the New Testament. “He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me, etc., etc.,” is said in Matthew (x, 37). Do the M ASTERS of Theosophy demand as much? Yours in the Search of Light. L. M. C. This is an old, old question, and a still older charge against theosophy, started first by its enemies. We emphatically an s wer, NO ; adding that no theosophical publication could have rendered itself` guilty o f such a FALSEHOOD and calumny. No follower of theosophy, least of all a disciple of the “Ma sters of Theosophy” (the chela of a guru ), would ever be accepted on such conditions.

For it is only in the Latin Church that it has become a meritorious action, which is called serving God and Christ, to “abandon father and mother, wife and children,” and every duty of an honest man and citizen, in order to become a monk.

The Rules, however, of chelaship, or discipleship, are there, in many a Sanskrit and Tibetan volume. In Book IV of Kiu-ti, in the chapter on “ the Laws of Upasans ” (disciples), the qualifications expected in a “regular chela ” are “(1.) Perfect physical health.* (2.) Absolute mental and physical purity. (3.) Unselfishness of purpose; universal charity; pity for all animate beings. (4.) Truthfulness and unswerving faith in the laws of Karma. (5.) A courage undaunted in the support of truth, even in the face of peril to life. (6.) An intuitive perception of one’s being the vehicle of the manifested divine Atman (spirit). (7.) Calm indifference for, but a just appreciation of, everything that constitutes the objective and transitory world. (8.) Blessings of both parents † and their permission to become an Upasana (chela); and (9.) Celibacy, and freedom from any obligatory duty.” The two last rules are most strictly enforced. No man convicted of disrespect to his father or mother , or unjust abandonment of his wife , can ever be accepted even as a lay chela. This is sufficient, it is hoped. We have heard of` chelas who, having failed, perhaps in consequence of the neglect of some such duty, for one or another reason, have invariably thrown the blame and responsibility for it on the teaching of the Masters. This is but natural in poor and weak human beings who have not even the courage to recognize their own mistakes, or the rare nobility of publicly confessing them, but are always trying to find a scapegoat.

He objects to the statement that this institution lacks the enlightenment necessary to carry out a true system of philanthropy. He appears, also, to demur to the view that “the practical people either go on doing good unintentionally and often do “harm” and points to the workers amid our slums as a vindication of Christianity—which, by-the-bye, was in no sense attacked in the editorial so criticized. To this, repeating what was said, we maintain that more mischief has been done by emotional charity than sentimentalists care to face. Any student of political economy is familiar with this fact, which passes for a truism with all those who have devoted attention to the problem. No nobler sentiment than that which animates the unselfish philanthropist is conceivable; but the question at issue is not summed up in the recognition of this truth.

It does not affect their creed, for such natures would remain the same, whatever the prevailing dogmas chanced to be. It is certainly a very, poor illustration of the fruits of centuries of dogmatic Christianity that England should be so honey-combed with misery and poverty as she is—especially on the biblical ground that a tree must be judged by its fruits! It might, also, be argued, that the past history of the Churches, stained as it is with persecutions, the suppression of knowledge, crime and brutality, necessitates the turning over of a new leaf. The difficulties in the way are insuperable. “Churchianity” has, indeed, done its best to keep up with the age by assimilating the teachings of, and making veiled truces with, science, but it is incapable of affording a true spiritual ideal to the world. The same Church-Christianity assails with fruitless pertinacity, the evergrowing host of Agnostics and Materialists, but is as absolutely ignorant, as the latter, of the mysteries beyond the tomb. The great necessity for the Church, according to Professor Flint, is to keep the leaders of European thought within its fold. By such men it is, however, regarded as an anachronism. The Church is eaten up with scepticism within its own walls; free-thinking clergymen being now very common. This constant drain of vitality has reduced the true religion to a very low ebb, and it is to infuse a new current of ideas and aspirations into modern thought, in short, to supply a logical basis for an elevated morality, a science and philosophy which is suited to the knowledge of the day, that Theosophy comes before the world. Mere physical philanthropy, apart from the infusion of new influences and ennobling conceptions of life into the minds of the masses, is worthless. The gradual assimilation by mankind of great spiritual truths will alone revolutionize the face of civilization, and ultimately result in a far more effective panacea for evil, than the mere tinkering of superficial misery. Prevention is better than cure. Society A NSWERS TO Q UERIES  297 creates its own outcasts, crimi n als, and profligates, and then condemns and punishes its own Frankensteins, sentencing its own progeny, the “bone of its bone, and the flesh of its fles h ,” to a life of damnation on earth. Yet that society recognizes and enforces most hypocritically Christianity— i.e. , “Churchianity.” Shall we then, or shall we not, infer that the latter is unequal to the requirements of mankind? Evidently the former, and most painfully and obviously so, in its present dogmatic form, which makes of the beautiful ethics preached on the Mount, a Dead Sea fruit, a whited sepulchre, and no better. Furthermore, the same “M.,” alluding to Jesus as one with regard to whom there could be only two alternatives, writes that he “was either the Son of God or the vilest impostor who ever trod this earth.” We answer, not at all. Whether the Jesus of the New Testament"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"ever lived or not, whether he existed as an historical personage, or was simply a lay figure around which the Bible allegories clustered—the Jesus of Nazareth of Matthew and John is the ideal for every would-be sage and Western candidate-Theosophist to follow. That such an one as he, was a “Son of God,” is as undeniable as that he was neither the only “Son of God,” nor the first one, nor even the last who closed the series of the “Sons of God,” or the children of Divine Wisdom, on this earth. Nor is that other statement that in “His life he [Jesus] has ever spoken of himself as co-existent with Jehovah, the Supreme, the Centre of the Universe,” correct, whether in its dead letter, or hidden mystic sense. In no place does Jesus ever allude to “ Jehovah ”; but, on the contrary, attacking the Mosaic laws and the alleged Commandments given on Mount Sinai, he disconnects himself and his “Father” most distinctly and emphatically from the Sinaitic tribal God. The whole of Chapter V, in the Gospel of Matthew , is a passionate protest of the “man of peace, love and charity,” against the cruel, stern, and selfish commandments of` “the man of war,” the “Lord” of Moses ( Exod. , xv, 3). “Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old times,”—so and so—“But I say 298  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS u n t o y o u ,” q u i t e t h e r e v e r s e . C h r i stians who still hold to the Old Testament and the Jehovah of the Israelites, are at best schismatic Jews. Let them be that, by all means, if they will so have it; but they have no right to call themselves even Chrestians, let alone Christians.* It is a gross injustice and untruth to assert, as our anonymous correspondent does, that “the freethinkers are notoriously unholy in their lives.” Some of the noblest characters, as well as deepest thinkers of the day, adorn the ranks of Agnosticism, Positivism and Materialism. The latter are the worst enemies of Theosophy and Mysticism; but this is no reason why strict justice should not be done unto them. Colonel Ingersoll, a rank materialist, and the leader of freethought in America, is recognised, even by his enemies, as an ideal husband, father, friend and citizen, one of the noblest characters that grace the United States. Count Tolstoi is a freethinker who has long parted with the orthodox Church, yet his whole life is an exemplar of Christ-like altruism and self-sacrifice. Would to goodness every “Christian” should take those two “ infidels ” as his models in private and public life. The munificence of many freethinking philanthropists stands out in startling contrast with the apathy of the monied dignitaries of the Church. The above fling at the “enemies of the Church,” is as absurd as it is contemptible. “What can you offer to the dying woman who fears to tread alone the DARK UNKNOWN ?” we are asked. Our Christian critic here frankly confesses ( a ) that Christian dogmas have on l y developed fear of death, and ( b ) the agnosticism of the orthodox believer in Christian theology as to the future post-mortem state. It is, indeed, difficult to appreciate the peculiar type of bliss which orthodoxy offers its believers in—damnation.

The true Hell is life on Earth, as an effect of Karmic punishment following the preceding life during which the evil causes were produced. The Theosophist fears no hell but confidently expects rest and bliss during the interim between two incarnations, as a reward for all the unmerited suffering he has endured in an existence into which he was ushered by Karma, and during which he is, in most cases, as helpless as a torn-off leaf whirled about by the conflicting winds of social and private life. Enough has been given out at various times regarding the conditions of post-mortem existence, to furnish a solid block of information on this point. Christian theology has nothing to say on this burning question, except where it veils its ignorance by mystery and dogma; but Occultism, unveiling the symbology of the Bible, explains it thoroughly. —E D. –––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME VIII December, 1887 LITERARY JOTTINGS [ Lucifer, Vol. I, No. 4, December, 1887, pp. 329-334] H YLO -I DEALISM VERSUS “L UCIFER ,” AN D T HE “A DVERSARY.” “Under the head of “Correspondence” in the present number, two remarkable letters are published (See Text).

It was chaff, if anything, but surely no hostility; and even that was concerned with only some dreadful words and sentences, with reference to the new teaching, and had nothing whatever to do with Hylo-Idealism proper—a terra incognita for the writer at the time. But now that three pamphlets from the pens of our two correspondents have been received in our office, for review, and carefully read, Hylo-Idealism begins to assume a more tangible form before the reviewer’s eye.

They may be most expressive of true, real meaning, to a specialist of Dr. Lewins’ powers of thought; nevertheless, I make bold to say, that they are far more calculated to obscure than to enlighten the ordinary reader. In our modern day, when new philosophies spring out from the spawn of human overworked intellect like mushrooms from their mycelium after a rainy morning, the human brain and its capacities ought to be taken into a certain thoughtful consideration, and spared useless labour. Notwithstanding Dr. Lewins’ praiseworthy efforts to prove that brain (as far as we understand his aspirations and teachings) is the only reality in the whole kosmos, its limitations are painfully evident, on the whole. As philanthropists and theosophists, we entreat the founder of Hylo-Idealism and his disciples to be merciful to their new god, the “Ego-Brain,” and not tax too heavily its powers, if they would see it happily reign. For otherwise, it is sure to collapse before the new theory—or, let us call it philosophy—is even half appreciated by that “Ego-Brain.” ––––––––––– By speaking as we do, we are only pursuing a life-long policy.

Is the latter a schism, an improvement on the original name, a lapsus calami , or what? And now, having disburdened our heart of a heavy weight, we may proceed to give an opinion (so far very superficial), on the three Hylo-Idealistic (or Ideaistic ) pamphlets. ––––––––– Under the extraordinary title of Auto-Centricism and Humanis m versus Theism, or “Soli ps ism (Egoism) = Atheism” (W. Stewart & Co., 41, Farringdon Street, E.C.; and Freethought Publishing Co., 63, Fleet Street, E.C.)—Dr. Lewins publishes a series of letters on the subject of the philosophy of which he is the founder. It is impossible not to feel admiration for the manner in which these letters are written. They show a great deal of sincere conviction and deep thought, and give evidence of a most wide and varied reading. However his readers may dissent from the writer's conclusions, the research with which he has strengthened his theory, cannot fail to attract their attention, and smooth their way through the somewhat tortuous labyrinth of arguments before them. But— Dr. Lewins is among those who regard consciousness as a function of the nerve-tissue; and in this aspect, he is an uncompromising materialist. Yet, on the other hand, he holds that the Universe, God, and thought, have no reality whatever, apart from the individual Ego. The L ITERARY J OTTINGS   303 Ego is again resolvable into brai n -process. We thus arrive at the doctrine that Brain is the workshop in which all our ideas of external things are originated. Apart from brain there is no Ego, no external world. What, then, is the Brain itself—this solitary object in a void universe? Hylo-Idealism does not say. Thus, the author cannot escape the confusion of thought which his unique working-union of materialism and idealism involves. The oscillation between these two poles is strikingly apparent in the subjoined quotations. At one point Matter is discussed as if it were an objective reality; at another, it is regarded as a mere “phantasm of the Ego.” The Brain alone survives throughout in solitary state. We quote from the two pamphlets— M ATTER A SSERTED"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"“ Matter, organic and inorganic . . . is now fully known . . . . to perform . . . all material operations.” — Auto-Centricism , p. 40. “. . . man is all body or matter . . . .” — Ibid ., p. 40. “Abstract . . . thought [is] neuropathy . . . disease of the nervous centres .” — Humanism versus Theism , p. 25. “What we call mind . . . is a function of certain nerve structures in the organism. ” — Humanism v.

Matter is at one time credited with a real being, and again resolved into a mere mental figment as circumstances demand. If Matter is, as the author frequently states, unreal, it is at least clear that the brain, one of its many phases, goes with it!! As to the learned doctor’s assertion that perception is relative, a theory which runs through his whole work, we have but one answer. This conception is, in no sense whatever, a monopoly of Hylo-Idealists, as Dr. Lewins appears to think. The illusory nature of the phenomenal world—of the things of sense—is not only a belief common to the old Brahminical metaphysics, and to the majority of modern psychologists, but it is also a vital tenet of Theosophy. The latter distinctly realises matter as a “bundle of attributes,” ultimately resolvable into the subjective sensations of a “percipient.” The connection of this simple truth with the hylo-idealistic denial of soul is not apparent. Its acceptance has, also, no bearing on the problem as to whether there may not exist a duality —within the limits of manifested being— or contrast between Mind and the Substance of matter.

The Monism, then, of Dr. Lewins and other negative thinkers of the day, is evidently at fault, when applied to unify the contrast of mental and material facts in the conditioned universe. Beyond the latter, it is indeed valid, but that is scarcely a question for practical philosophy. To close with a reference this once to Dr. Lewins’ letter (see “Correspondence” in the text), in which he makes his subsequent assertion to the effect that God is the \"functional [ sic ] image,” of the Ego, we should prefer L ITERARY J OTTINGS  305 to suggest that all individual “ selves” are but dim reflections of the universal soul of the Kosmos. The orthodox concept of God is not, as he contends, a myth or phantasm of the brain; it is rather an expression of` a vague consciousness of the universal, all-pervading Logos.

Courtney contributes his quota to the discussion of the “Brain Theory of mind and matter.” He is, if we mistake not, an avowed disciple of Dr. Lewins, and, perhaps, identical, with the “C.N.,” who watched over the cradle of the “new philosophy.” * The whole gist of the latter may be summed up as an attempt to frame a working-union of Materialism and Idealism. This result is effected on two lines: (1) in the acceptance of the idealistic theorem, that the so-called external world only exists in our consciousness; and (2) in the designation of that consciousness, in its turn, as a mere function of Brain. The first of these contentions is unquestionably valid, in so far as it concerns the world of appearances, or Maya; it is, however, as “old as the hills,” and incorporated into the Hylo-Ideal argument from anterior sources. The second is untenable, for the simple reason that on the premises of the new creed itself, the brain, as an object of perception, can possess no reality outside of the Ego. Hegelians might reply that Brain is but an idea of the Ego, and cannot hence determine the existence of the latter—its creator. –––––––––– * [“C.N.” stands for Constance Naden, pseud. of Caroline Woodhill (1858-89).— Compiler .] –––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"306  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Metaphysicism will, however, fin d much to interest them in Mr. Courtney’s brochure, representative, as it is, of the new and more subtle phase into which modern scepticism is entering.

As explained in a somewhat confused sentence: “There was no Jewish Astoreth, though the Syrian goddess, Ashtoreth, or Astarte, often appears in Biblical literature, the moon goddess, the complement of Baal, the Sun God.” This, no doubt, is extremely learned and conveys quite new information. Yet such an astounding statement as that the whole of the foot-note in Lucifer is “pure imagination and bad history” is very risky indeed.

We advise our critic of the Jewish World to turn to his own prophets, to Jeremiah, foremost of all. We open “Scripture” and find in it: “the Lord God” while accusing his “backsliding Israel and treacherous Judah” of following in “the ways of Egypt and of Assyria,” of drinking the waters of Sihor, and “serving strange Gods,” enumerating his grievances in this wise: . . . . . according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. . . . . ( Jer., ii, 28). They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them. . . . .

And is it any more “pure imagination” to say that the Jews offered cakes to their Ast o reth and called her “Queen of Heaven”? Then the “Lord God” must, indeed, be guilty of more than “a delicate expansion of facts” when thundering to, and through,Jeremiah: Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, TO MAKE CAKES to the queen of heaven, an d to pour out drink offering s unto other gods . . . . .

Then the ancestors of the editors of the Jewish World must have been the victims of “suggestion,” when, snubbing Jeremiah (and not entirely without good reason), they declared to him: As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.

We are told that “happily for them [the Jews] there was no Jewish Astoreth.” The Jewish World has yet to learn, we see, that there would have been no Greek Venus Aphrodite; no Ourania, her earlier appellation; nor would she have been confounded with the Assyrian Mylitta (Herodotus, History , I, 199; Pausanias, Periêgêsis, I, xiv, 7; Hesychius, ) had it not been for the Phoenicians and other Semites. We say the “Jewish Astoreth,” and we maintain what we say, on the authority of the Iliad, the Odyssey , of Renan, and many others. Venus Aphrodite is one with the Astarte , Astoreth, etc. of the Phoenicians, and she is one (as a planet) with “Lucifer” the “Morning Star.” So far back as the days of Homer, she was confounded with Kypris, an Oriental goddess brought by the Phoenician Semites from their Asiatic travels ( Iliad , V, 330, 422, 458). Her worship appears first at Cythera, a Phoenician settlement depôt or trade-establishment ( Odyssey , VIII, 362; F. G. Welcker, Griechische Götterlehre, I, 666).

Astoreth was a goddess of generation, presiding at human birth (as Jehovah was god of generation, foremost of all). She was the moon-goddess, and a planet at the same time, whose worship originated with the Phoenicians and Semites. It flourished most in the Phoenician settlements and colonies in Sicily, at Eryx. There hosts of Hetaerae were attached to her temples, as hosts of Kadeshim, called by a more sincere name in the Bible, were, to the house of the Lord, “where the women wove hangings for the grove” (II Kings, xxiii, 7). All this shows well the Semitic provenance of Astoreth-Venus in her capacity of “great Mother.” Let us pause. We advise sincerely the Jewish World to abstain from throwing stones at other peoples’ beliefs, so long as its own faith is but a house of glass. And though Jeremy Taylor may think that “to be proud of one's learning is the greatest ignorance,” yet, in this case it is but simple justice to say that it is really desirable for our friends the Jews that the writer in Lucifer of the criticised note about Astoreth should know less of history and the Bible, and her unlucky critic in the Jewish World learn a little more about it. “A DVERSARY .” – – – – – – – – – – "},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME VIII December, 1887 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES [ Lucifer , Vol. I, No. 4, December, 1887 , pp. 311-318] [J.

Several of the points raised in this letter are answered by Dr. Keightley. A number of unsigned footnotes, presumably by H.P.B., are appended to the text.] M ISCELLANEOUS N OTES  311 [J. H. Beatty writes: “Does a man, b y merely denying the existence of a law of Nature or the universe, transgress that law? I think not.”] Mr. Keightley’s meaning (and it is difficult for the words to bear any other interpretation) was that the denial of harmony is evidence that, at some previous time, the man who denies has set himself in opposition to the law, in virtue of those very desires and instincts of his animal personality to which Mr. Beatty alludes later on. In this sense, Mr. Beatty is right in saying that a law of the universe cannot be broken; but its limits may be transgressed, and consequently an attempt made by man to make himself into a small, but rival universe. It is the old story of the china pot and the iron kettle, and the fact that china gets the worst of it is conclusive that the china is struggling against Nature. [“. . . who is going to contend that the law of gravitation has ever been ‘broken,’ has ever ceased to act. . . .”] Will Mr. Beatty explain the phenomenon of a comet flirting its tail round the sun in defiance of the “ law of gravitation”?

[“Truly this Karma is a bewildering subject!”] “This Karma,” as Mr. Beatty expresses it, would not be quite so bewildering a subject if critics would bear in mind the context and not fall foul of a detached expression—not even a sentence. The “interest of the soul’s welfare in heaven” is concentrated by John Smith on John Smith as John Smith in heaven, and in order that the said John Smith may go on enjoying the things he loved on earth. As his earth life has ended, John Smith has changed and is “transient.” If he were not transient a very natural inference would follow, that progress, evolution, &c., on whatever plane of being, does not prevail.

In the same way the contrast of Subject and Object is essential to our present finite consciousness, although it has no basis of reality beyond the limits of conditional being. Moreover, even in this phenomenal Universe, equilibrium (harmony) is most certainly maintained by the very conflict of the contrasted forces alluded to. [“The Universe must, at bottom, be a Harmony. Why? . . .”] Mr. Beatty asks how the Universe would come to a stand-still, if the law of Harmony was suspended. Now suppose, for instance, the law of “gravity” was not counterbalanced by the action of other “forces,” what would happen?

P. B. was published posthumously. The actual time when it was written cannot be determined at present with any degree of accuracy, especially as the text contains no very definite clues to this effect. The same applies to the essay entitled: “Psychology, The Science of the Soul,” which is made to follow the present one. These two essays are definitely inter-related, and have at least one passage in common. It is very probable that they were written at approximately the same period. While no definite date is known, it can, nevertheless, be stated that the present essay was written later than January, 1887, because it quotes from T. Subba Row’s lecture on the Bhagavad Gîtâ, delivered at the Adyar Convention in December, 1886; it is, of course, quite possible that the essay was not written until after the launching of Lucifer in September, 1887. It is, however, very doubtful that it would have been written after the publication of The Secret Doctrine, in the Fall of 1888, because it mentions the Section on the “Monads, Gods, and Atoms,” in that work, and refers to it as being in Volume I, Book II, while this Section is to be found in Vol. I, Book I, Part III, of the final text of the work. It is, therefore, very likely that this essay was penned before the final version of H. P. B.’s monumental opus had been fully drawn up. The same line of reasoning applies to the essay on Psychology, which follows the present one. It may be that both essays were intended for The Theosophist but were laid aside for one reason or another and not submitted. It seems, therefore, plausible to publish both of these essays at the end of the year 1887, as a mean value in time, fairly closely approximating the probable period at which they were written. — Compiler .] Materialists who arraign the Occultists and Theosophists for believing that every Force (so called) in Nature has at its origin a substantial NOUMENON, an Entity, conscious and intelligent, whether it be a Planetary (Dhyan Chohan) or an Elemental, are advised to fix their attention, first of all, on a far more dangerous body than the one called the Theosophical Society. We mean the Society in the U.S. of America whose members call 316  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS themselves the Substantialists. We call it dangerous for this reason, that this body, combining in itself dogmatic Church Christianity, i.e., the anthropomorphic element of the Bible—with sterling Science, makes, nevertheless, the latter subservient in all to the former. This is equivalent to saying, that the new organization, will, in its fanatical dogmatism—if it wins the day—lead on the forthcoming generations to anthropomorphism past redemption. It will achieve this the more easily in our age of Science-worship, since a show of undeniable learning must help to impart additional strength to belief in a gigantic human god, as their"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"hypotheses, like those of modern materialistic science, may be easily built to answer their particular aim. The educated and thoughtful classes of Society, once set free from ecclesiastical thraldom, could laugh at a St. Augustine’s or a “venerable” Bede’s scientific data, which led them to maintain on the authority and dead letter of what they regarded as Revelation that our Earth, instead of being a sphere, was flat, hanging under a crystalline canopy studded with shining brass nails and a sun no larger than it appears. But the same classes will be always forced by public opinion into respecting the hypotheses of modern Science—in whatever direction the nature of scientific speculation may lead them. They have been so led for the last century—into crass Materialism; they may be so led again in an opposite direction. The cycle has closed, and if Science ever falls into the hands of the Opposition—the learned “Reverends” and bigoted Churchmen—the world may find itself gradually approaching the ditch on the opposite side and be landed at no distant future in crass anthropomorphism. Once more the masses will have rejected true philosophy—impartial and unsectarian—and will thus be caught again in new meshes of their own weaving, the fruitage and results of the reaction created by an all-denying age. The solemn ideal of a universal, infinite, all-pervading Noumenon of Spirit, of an impersonal and absolute Deity, will fade out of the human mind once more, and will make room for the MONSTER-GOD of sectarian nightmares. THE SUBSTANTIAL NATURE OF MAGNETISM  317 Now, modern official science is composed—as at present—of 5 per cent. of undeniable axiomatic truths and facts, and of 95 per cent. of mere speculation. Furthermore, it has laid itself open to endless attacks, owing to its numerous mutually contradictory hypotheses, each one as scientific, in appearance, as the other. On the other hand, the Substantialists, who rank, as they boast, among their numbers some of the most eminent men of Science in the United States, have undeniably discovered and accumulated a vast store of facts calculated to upset the modern theories on Force and Matter. And once that their data are shown correct, in this conflict between (materialistic) Science and (a still more materialistic) Religion—the outcome of the forthcoming battle is not difficult to foresee: modern Science will be floored. The Substantiality of certain Forces of Nature cannot be denied—for it is a fact in Kosmos. No Energy or Force without Matter, no Matter without Force, Energy or Life— however latent. But this ultimate Matter is—Substance or the Noumenon of matter. Thus, the head of the golden Idol of scientific truth will fall, because it stands on feet of clay. Such a result would not be anything to be regretted, except for its immediate consequences: the golden Head will remain the same, only its pedestal will be replaced by one as weak and as much of clay as ever. Instead of resting on Materialism, science will rest on anthropomorphic superstition—if the Substantialists ever gain the day. For, instead of holding to philosophy alone, pursued in a spirit of absolute impartiality, both materialists and adherents of what is so pompously called the “Philosophy of Substantialism” work on lines traced by preconception and with a prejudged object; and both stretch their facts on the procrustean beds of their respective hobbies. It is facts that have to fit their theories, even at the risk of mutilating the immaculate nature of Truth. Before presenting the reader with extracts from the work of a Substantialist—those extracts showing better than would any critical review, the true nature of the claims of “The Substantial Philosophy”—we mean to 318  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS go no further, as we are really very little concerned with them, and intend to waste no words over their flaws and pretensions. Nevertheless, as their ideas on the nature of physical Forces and phenomena are curiously— in some respects only— like the occult doctrines, our intention is to utilize their arguments—on Magnetism, to begin with. These are unanswerable, and we may thus defeat exact science by its own methods of observation and weapons. So far, we are only acquainted with the theories of the Substantialists by their writings. It is possible that, save the wide divergence between our views on the nature of the"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"“phenomena-producing causes”—as they queerly call physical forces—there is but little difference in our opinions with regard to the substantial nature of Light, Heat, Electricity, Magnetism, etc., etc., perhaps only one in the form and terms used. No Theosophist, however, would agree to such expressions as are used in the New Doctrine: e.g. , “If its principles be true, then every force or form of Energy known to science must be a substantial Entity .” For although Dr. Hall’s proofs with regard to magnetic fluid being something more than “a mode of motion” are irrefutable, still there are other “forces” which are of quite a different nature. As this paper, however, is devoted to prove the substantiality of magnetism—whether animal or physical—we will now quote from the Scientific Arena (July 1886) the best arguments that have ever appeared against the materialistic theory of modern Science. To admit for one moment that a single force of nature, such as sound, light, or heat , is but the vibratory motion of matter, whether that material body be highly attenuated as in the case of the supposed ether, less attenuated as in the case of air, or solid as in the case of a heated bar of iron, is to give away to the rank claims of materialism the entire analogy of nature and science in favour of a future life for humanity. And well do the materialistic scientists of this country and Europe know it. And to the same extent do they fear the spread and general acceptance of the Substantial Philosophy, knowing full well that the moment the forces of nature shall be recognised and taught by the schools of this land as real substantial entities, and as soon as the mode-of-motion doctrines of sound, light, heat, etc., shall be abandoned, that soon will their materialistic occupation have gone for ever . . . . . THE SUBSTANTIAL NATURE OF MAGNETISM  319 Hence, it is the aim of this present paper, after thus reiterating and enforcing the general scope of the argument as presented last month, to demonstrate force, per se, to be an immaterial substance, and in no sense a motion of material particles. In this way we purpose to show the absolute necessity for Christian scientists everywhere adopting the broad principles of the Substantial Philosophy, and doing it at once, if they hope to break down materialistic atheism in this land or logically to defend religion by scientific analogy, and thus prove the substantial existence of God as well as the probable substantial existence of the human soul after death. This they now have the privilege of doing successfully, and of thus triumphantly re-enforcing their scriptural arguments by the concurrent testimony of nature herself. We could select any one of several of the physical forms of force as the crucial test of the new philosophy, or as the touch-stone of Substantialism. But to save circumlocution and detail of unnecessary explanation as much as possible, in this leading and paramount demonstration, we select what no scientist on earth will question as a representative natural force or so-called form of energy—namely, magnetism. This force, from the very simple and direct manifestation of its phenomena in displacing ponderable bodies at a distance from the magnet, and without having any tangible substance connecting the magnet therewith, is selected for our purpose, since it has well proved the champion physical puzzle to modern mode-of-motion philosophers, both in this country and in Europe. Even to the greatest living physicists, such as Helmholtz, Tyndall, Sir William Thomson, and others, the mysterious action of magnetism, under any light which modern science can shed upon it, admittedly affords a problem which has proved to be completely bewildering to their intellects, simply because they have unfortunately never caught a glimpse of the basic principles of the Substantial Philosophy which so clearly unravels the mystery. In the light of these principles such a thinker as Sir William Thomson, instead of teaching, as he did in his opening address on the five senses before the Midland Institute, at Birmingham, England, that magnetism was but the molecular motion, or as he expressed it, but the “quality of matter,” of the “rotation of the molecules” of the magnet, would have seen at a glance the utter want of any relation, as cause to effect, between such moving molecules in the magnet (provided they do move), and the lifting of the mass of iron at a distance. It is passing strange that men so intelligent as Sir William Thomson and Prof. Tyndall had not long ago"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"reached the conclusion that magnetism must of necessity be a substantial thing, however invisible or intangible, when it thus stretches out its mechanical but invisible fingers to a distance from the magnet and pulls or pushes an inert piece of metal! That they have not seen the absolute necessity for such a conclusion, as the only conceivable explanation of the 320  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS mechanical effects produced, and the manifest inconsistency of any other supposition, is one of the astounding results of the confusing and blinding influence of the present false theories of science upon otherwise logical and profound intellects. And that such men could be satisfied in supposing that the minute and local vibrations of the molecules and atoms of the magnet (necessarily limited to the dimensions of the steel itself) could by any possibility reach out to a distance beyond it and thus pull or push a bar of metal, overcoming its inertia, tempts one to lose all respect for the sagacity and profundity of the intellects of these great names in science. At all events, such manifest want of perspicacity in modern physicists appeals in a warning voice of thunder tones to rising young men of this country and Europe to think for themselves in matters pertaining to science and philosophy, and to accept nothing on trust simply because it happens to be set forth or approved by some great name. Another most remarkable anomaly in the case of the physicists to whom we have here referred is this: while failing to see the unavoidable necessity of an actual substance of some kind going forth from the poles of the magnet and connecting with the piece of iron by which to lift it and thus accomplish a physical result, that could have been effected in no other way, they are quick to accept the agency of an all-pervading ether (a substance not needed at all in nature) by which to produce light on this earth as mere motion, and thus make it conform to the supposed sound-waves in the air! In this way, by the sheer invention of a not-needed material substance, they have sought to convert not only light, heat, and magnetism, but all the other forces of nature into modes of motion, and for no reason except that sound had been mistaken as a mode of motion by previous scientists. And strange to state, notwithstanding this supposed ether is as intangible to any of our senses, and just as unrecognisable by any process known to chemistry or mechanics as is the substance which of necessity must pass out from the poles of the magnet to seize and lift the bar of iron, yet physicists cheerfully accept the former, for which no scientific necessity on earth or in heaven exists, while they stolidly refuse to recognise the latter, though absolutely needed to accomplish the results observed! Was ever such inconsistency before witnessed in a scientific theory? Let us scrutinize this matter a little further before leaving it. If the mere “rotation of molecules” in the steel magnet can produce a mechanical effect on a piece of iron at a distance, even through a vacuum, as Sir William Thomson asserts, why may not the rotation of the molecules of the sun cause light at a distance without the intervening space being filled up with a jelly-like material substance of \"enormous rigidity,\" to be thrown into waves? It must strike every mind capable of thinking scientifically that the original invention of an all-pervading “material,” “rigid” and “inert” ether, as the essential cause of light at a distance from a luminous body, THE SUBSTANTIAL NATURE OF MAGNETISM  321 was one of the most useless expenditures of mechanical ingenuity which the human brain ever perpetrated—that is, if there is the slightest truth in the teaching of Sir William Thomson that the mere “rotation of molecules” in the magnet will lift a distant bar of iron. Why cannot the rotation of the sun’s molecules just as easily produce light at a distance? Should it be assumed in sheer desperation by the mode-of-motion philosophers that it is the ether, filling"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"the space between the magnet and the piece of iron, which is thrown into vibration by the rotating molecules of the steel, and which thus lifts the distant iron, it would only be to make bad worse. If material vibration in the steel magnet, which is wholly unobservable, is communicated to the distant bar through a material substance and its vibratory motions, which are equally unobservable, is it not plain that their effects on the distant bar should be of the same mechanical character, namely, unobservable? Instead of this the iron is lifted bodily and seen plainly, and that without any observed tremor, as if done by a vibrating “jelly” such as ether is claimed to be! Besides, such bodily lifting of a ponderable mass is utterly incongruous with mere tremor, however powerful and observable such tremor or vibration might be, according to every principle known to mechanics. Common sense ought to assure any man that mere vibration or tremor, however powerful and sensible, can pull or push nothing. It is impossible to conceive of the accomplishment of such a result except by some substantial agent reaching out from the magnet, seizing the iron, and forcibly pulling and thus displacing it. As well talk of pulling a boat to the shore without some rope or other substantial thing connecting you with the boat. Even Sir William Thomson would not claim that the boat could be pulled by getting up a molecular vibration of the shore, or even by producing a visible tremor in the water, as Dr. Hamlin so logically showed in his recent masterly paper on Force. (See Microcosm, Vol. V, p. 98.) It is well known that a magnet will lift a piece of iron at the same distance precisely through sheets of glass as if no glass intervened. The confirmed atheist Mr. Smith, of Cincinnati, Ohio, to whom we referred in our papers on Substantialism, in The Microcosm (Vol. III, pages 278, 311), was utterly confounded by this exhibition of the substantial force of magnetism acting at a distance through impervious plates of glass. When we placed a quantity of needles and tacks on the plate and passed the poles of the magnet beneath it, causing them to move with the magnet, he saw for the first time in his life the operation of a real substance, exerting a mechanical effect in displacing ponderable bodies of metal in defiance of all material conditions, and with no possible material connection or free passage between the source and termination of such substantial agency. And he asked in exclamation, if this be so, may there not be a substantial, intelligent, and immaterial God, and may I not 322  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS have a substantial but immaterial soul which can live separately from my body after it is dead ? He then raised the query, asking if we were certain that it was not the invisible pores of the glass plate through which the magnetic force found its way, and therefore whether this force might not be a refined form of matter after all? He even assisted us in filling the plate with boiled water, on which to float a card with needles placed thereon, thus to interpose between them and the magnet the most imporous of all known bodies. But it made not the slightest difference, the card with its cargo of needles moving hither and thither as the magnet was moved beneath both plate and water. This was sufficient even for that most critical but candid materialist, and he confessed that there were substantial but immaterial entities in heaven and earth never dreamt of in his atheistic philosophy. Here, then, is the conclusive argument by which we demonstrate that magnetism, one of the forces of nature, and a fair representative of all the natural forces, is not only a real, substantial entity, but an absolutely immaterial substance; * thus justifying our original classification of the entities of the universe into material and immaterial substances . 1. If magnetism were not a real substance, it could not lift a piece of metal bodily at a distance from the magnet, any more than our hand could lift a weight from the floor without some substantial connection between the two. It is a self-evident truism as an axiom in mechanics, that no body can move or displace another body at a distance without a real, substantial medium connecting the two through which the result is accomplished, otherwise it would be a mechanical effect without a cause—a self-evident absurdity in philosophy. Hence, the force of magnetism is a real, substantial entity. 2. If magnetism were not an immaterial substance, then any practically imporous body intervening between the magnet and the attracted object would, to some extent at least, impede the passage of the"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"magnetic current, which it does not do. If magnetism were a very refined or attenuated form of matter, and if it thus depended for its passage through other material bodies upon their imperceptible pores, then, manifestly, some difference in the freedom of its passage, and in the consequent attractive force of the distant magnet should result by great difference in the porosity of the different bodies tested, as would be the case, for example, in forcing wind through wire-netting having larger or smaller interstices, and consequently offering greater or less resistance. Whereas, in the case of this magnetic substance, no difference whatever results in the energy of its mechanical pull on a distant piece of iron, however many or few of the practically imporous sheets of glass, rubber, or whatever other –––––––––– * This is a very wrong word to use.

The pull is always with precisely the same force, and will move the suspended piece of iron at the same distance away from it in each and every case, however refined and delicate may be the instruments by which the tests are measured. The above quoted passages are positively unanswerable. As far as magnetic force, or fluid, is concerned the Substantialists have most undeniably made out their case; and their triumph will be hailed with joy by every Occultist. It is impossible to see, indeed, how the phenomena of magnetism—whether terrestrial or animal—can be explained otherwise than by admitting a material, or substantial magnetic fluid. This, even some of the Scientists do not deny—Helmholtz believing that electricity must be as atomic as matter —which it is (Helmholtz, “Faraday Lecture”).* And, unless Science is prepared to divorce force from matter, we do not see how it can support its position much longer. But we are not at all so sure about certain other Forces—so far as their effects are concerned—and Esoteric philosophy would find an easy objection to every assumption of the Substantialists— e.g., with regard to sound.

As explained by our learned Vedantin Brother—T. Subba Row— Mulaprakriti, the first universal aspect of Parabrahma, its Kosmic Veil, and whose essence, to us, is unthinkable, is to the LOGOS “as material as any object is material to us” ( Notes on Bhag. Gita ) Hence—no Occultist would describe Substance as “immaterial” in esse. Substance is a confusing term, in any case. We may call our body, or an ape, or a stone, as well as any kind of fabric—“substantial.” Therefore, we call “Essence” rather, the material of the bodies of those Entities—the supersensuous Beings, in whom we believe, and who do exist, but whom Science and its admirers regard as superstitious nonsense, calling fictions alike a “personal” god and the angels of the Christians, as they would our Dhyan Chohans, or the Devas, “Planetary Men,” Genii, etc., etc., of the Kabalists and Occultists. But the latter would never dream of calling the phenomena of Light Sound, Heat, Cohesion, etc.—“ Entities ,” as the Substantialists do. They would define those Forces as purely immaterial perceptive effects— without, of substantial and essential CAUSES—within: at the ultimate end of which, or at the origin, stands an ENTITY, the essence of the latter changing with that of the Element * it belongs to. (See “Monads, Gods, and Atoms” of Volume I, The Secret Doctrine, Book II.)† Nor can the Soul be confused with FORCES, which are on quite another plane of perception.

If the principles of Substantialism be true, then, as there shown, every force or form of energy known to science must be a substantial entity. We further endeavoured to show that if one form of force were conclusively demonstrated to be a substantial or objective existence, it would be a clear departure from reason and consistency not to assume all the forces or phenomena-producing causes in nature also to be substantial entities. But if one form of physical force, or one single phenomenon-producing cause, such as heat, light, or sound, could be clearly shown to be the mere motion of material particles, and not a substantial entity or thing, then by rational analogy and the harmonious uniformity of nature's laws, all the other forces or phenomena-producing causes, whether physical, vital, mental, or spiritual, must come within the same category as non-entitative modes of motion of material particles. Hence it would follow in such case, that the soul, life, mind, or spirit, so far from being a substantial entity which can form the basis of a hope for an immortal existence beyond the present life, must, according to materialism, and as the mere motion of brain and nerve particles, cease to exist whenever such physical particles shall cease to move at death. SPIRIT—a “substantial Entity”!! Surely Substantialism cannot pretend very seriously to the title of philosophy— in such case. But let us read the arguments to the end. Here we find a just and righteous attack on Materialism wound up with the same unphilosophical assertion! . . . From the foregoing statement of the salient positions of materialistic science, as they bear against the existence of the soul after death, we drew the logical conclusion that no Christian philosopher who accepts the current doctrines of sound, light, and heat as but modes of molecular motion, can ever answer the analogical reasoning of the materialist against the immortality of man. No possible view, as we have so often insisted, can make the least headway against such materialistic reasoning or frame any reply to this great argument of Haeckel and Huxley against the soul as an entity and its possible existence separate from the body, save the teaching of Substantialism which so consistently maintains that the soul, life, mind, and spirit are necessarily substantial forces or entities from the analogies of physical science, namely, the substantial nature of all the physical forces, including gravity, electricity, magnetism, cohesion, sound, light, heat, etc. This impregnable position of the Substantialist from logical analogy, based on the harmonious uniformity of nature’s laws and forces, forms the bulwark of the Substantial Philosophy, and must in the THE SUBSTANTIAL NATURE OF MAGNETISM  327 nature of things forever constitute the strong tower of that system of teaching. If the edifice of Substantialism, thus founded and fortified, can be taken and sacked by the forces of materialism, then our labours for so many years have manifestly come to naught. Say, if you please, that the armies of Substantialism are thus burning the bridges behind them. So be it. We prefer death to either surrender or retreat; for if this fundamental position cannot be maintained against the combined forces of the enemy, then all is lost, materialism has gained the day, and death is an eternal annihilation to the human race. Within this central citadel of principles, therefore, we have intrenched ourselves to survive or perish, and here, encircled by this wall of adamant, we have stored all our treasures and munitions of war, and if the agnostic hordes of materialistic science wish to possess them, let them train upon it their heaviest artillery. . . .

One minister of our acquaintance speaks glowingly of the ultimate success of the Substantial Philosophy, and proudly calls himself a substantialist, but refuses to include sound among the substantial forces and entities, thus virtually accepting the wave-theory! In the name of all logical consistency, what could that minister say in reply to another “substantialist” who would insist upon the beauty and truth of Substantialism, but who could not include light ? And then another who could not include heat, or electricity, or magnetism, or gravity ? Yet all of them good “substantialists” on the very same principle as is the one who leaves sound out of the substantial category, while still claiming to be an orthodox substantialist! Why should they not leave life -force and mind -force and spirit-force out of the list of entities, thus making them, like sound-force (as materialists insist), but the vibration of material particles, and still claim the right to call themselves good substantialists? Haeckel and Huxley would then be duly qualified candidates for baptism into the church of Substantialism. The truth is, the minister who can admit for one moment that sound consists of but the motion of air-particles, and thus, that it is not a substantial entity, is a materialist at bottom, though he may not be conscious of the logical maelstrom that is whirling him to scientific destruction. We have all heard of the play of “Hamlet,” with the Prince of Denmark left out. Such would be the scientific 328  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS play of Substantialism with the sound question ignored, and the theory of acoustics handed over to materialism. (See our editorial on “The Meaning of the Sound Discussion,” The Microcosm , Vol. V, p. 197.) We sympathize with the “Minister” who refuses to include Sound among “Substantial Entities ” We believe in FOHAT, but would hardly refer to his Voice and Emanations as “Entities,” though they are produced by an electric shock of atoms and repercussions producing both Sound and Light. Science would accept no more our Fohat than the Sound or Light- Entities of the “Substantial Philosophy” (?). But we have this satisfaction, at any rate, that, once thoroughly explained, Fohat will prove more philosophical than either the materialistic or substantial theories of the forces of nature. How can anyone with pretensions to both a scientific and psychological mind, speaking of Soul and especially of Spirit, place them on the same level as the physical phenomena of nature, and this, in a language one can apply only to physical facts! Even Professor Bain, “a monistic ANNIHILATIONIST,” as he is called, confesses that “mental and bodily states are utterly contrasted.” * Thus, the direct conclusion the Occultists and the Theosophists can come to at any rate on the prima facie evidence furnished them by writings which no philosophy can now rebut, is—that Substantial Philosophy, which was brought forth into this world to fight materialistic science and to slay it, surpasses it immeasurably in Materialism. No Bain, no Huxley, nor even Haeckel, has ever confused to this degree mental and physical phenomena. At the same time the “apostles of Materialism” are on a higher plane of philosophy than their opponents. For, the charge preferred against them of teaching that Soul is “the mere motion of brain and nerve particles” is untrue, for they never did so teach.

The inference that the acceptance of the received scientific theories on light, sound and heat, etc., would be equivalent to accepting the soul motion of molecules —is certainly hardly worth discussion. It is quite true that some thirty or forty years ago Büchner and Moleschott attempted to prove that sensation and thought are a movement of matter. But this has been pronounced by a well-known English Annihilationist “unworthy of the name of ‘philosophy’.” Not one man of real scientific reputation or of any eminence, not Tyndall, Huxley, Maudsley, Clifford, Bain, Spencer nor Lewes, in England, nor Virchow, nor Haeckel in Germany, has ever gone so far as to say:—“Thought IS a motion of molecules.” Their only quarrel with the believers in a soul was and is, that while the latter maintain that soul is the cause of thought, they (the Scientists) assert that thought is the concomitant of certain physical processes in the brain. Nor have they ever said (the real scientists and philosophers, however materialistic) that thought and nervous motion are the same, but that they are “the subjective and objective sides of the same thing.” John Stuart Mill is a good authority and an example to quote, and thus deny the charge. For, speaking of the rough and rude method of attempting to resolve sensation into nervous motion (taking as his example the case of the nerve-vibrations to the brain which are the physical side of the light perception), “at the end of all these motions, there is something which is not motion— there is a feeling or sensation of colour . . . ,” he says. Hence, it is quite true to say, that “the subjective feeling here spoken of by Mill will outlive even the acceptance of the undulatory theory of light, or heat, as a mode of motion.” For the latter is based on a physical speculation and the 330  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS former is built on everlasting philosophy— however imperfect, because so tainted with Materialism. Our quarrel with the Materialists is not so much for their soulless Forces, as for their denying the existence of any “Force-bearer,” the Noumenon of Light, Electricity, etc. To accuse them of not making a difference between mental and physical phenomena is equal to proclaiming oneself ignorant of their theories. The most famous Negationists are to-day the first to admit that SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS and MOTION “are at the opposite poles of existence.” That which remains to be settled between us and the materialistic IDEALISTS—a living paradox by the way, now personified by the most eminent writers on Idealistic philosophy in England—is the question whether that consciousness is only experienced in connection with organic molecules of the brain or not. We say it is the thought or mind which sets the molecules of the physical brain in motion; they deny any existence to mind, independent of the brain. But even they do not call the seat of the mind “a molecular fabric,” but only that it is “the mind-principle ” — the seat or the organic basis of the manifesting mind. That such is the real attitude of materialistic science may be demonstrated by reminding the reader of Mr. Tyndall’s confessions in his Fragments of Science, * for since the days of his discussions with Dr. Martineau, the attitude of the Materialists has not changed. This attitude remains unaltered, unless, indeed, we place the Hylo-Idealists on the same level as Mr. Tyndall—which would be absurd. Treating of the phenomenon of Consciousness, the great physicist quotes this question from Dr. Martineau: “A man can say ‘I feel, I think, I love,’ but how does consciousness infuse itself into the problem?” And he thus answers: The passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is unthinkable. Granted that a definite thought and a definite molecular action in the brain occur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual organ, nor apparently any rudiment"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"–––––––––– * [Part II, Introd., pp. 340-41, in 6th ed., New York: D.

They appear together, but we do not know why . Were our minds and senses so expanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all their motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges, if such there be; and were we intimately acquainted with the corresponding states of thought and feeling, we should be as far as ever from the solution of the problem, ‘How are these physical processes connected with the facts of consciousness?’ The chasm between the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually impassable. Thus, there appears to be far less disagreement between the Occultists and modern Science than between the former and the Substantialists. The latter confuse most hopelessly the subjective with the objective phases of all phenomena, and the Scientists do not, notwithstanding that they limit the subjective to the earthly or terrestrial phenomena only. In this they have chosen the Cartesian method with regard to atoms and molecules; we hold to the ancient and primitive philosophical beliefs, so intuitively perceived by Leibnitz. Our system can thus be called, as his was—“Spiritualistic and Atomistic.” Substantialists speak with great scorn of the vibratory theory of science. But, until able to prove that their views would explain the phenomena as well, filling, moreover, the actual gaps and flaws in the modern hypotheses, they have hardly the right to use such a tone. As all such theories and speculations are only provisional, we may well leave them alone. Science has made wonderful discoveries on the objective side of all the physical phenomena. Where it is really wrong is, when it perceives in matter alone—i.e., in that matter which is known to it— the alpha and the omega of all phenomena. To reject the scientific theory, however, of vibrations in light and sound, is to court as much ridicule as the scientists do in rejecting physical and objective spiritualistic phenomena by attributing them all to fraud. Science has ascertained and proved the exact rapidity with which the sound-waves travel, and it has artificially imitated—on the data of transmission of sound by those waves—the human voice and other acoustic phenomena. The sensation of sound— 332  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS the response of the sensory tract to an objective stimulus (atmospheric vibrations) is an affair of consciousness: and to call sound an “Entity” on this plane, is to objectivate most ridiculously a subjective phenomenon which is but an effect after all—the lower end of a concatenation of causes. If Materialism locates all in objective matter and fails to see the origin and primary causes of the Forces—so much the worse for the materialists; for it only shows the limitations of their own capacities of hearing and seeing—limitations which Huxley, for one, recognizes, for he is unable on his own confession to define the boundaries of our senses, and still asserts his materialistic tendency by locating sounds only in cells of matter, and on our sensuous plane. Behold, the great Biologist dwarfing our senses and curtailing the powers of man and nature in his usual ultrapoetical language. Hear him (as quoted by Stirling, Concerning Protoplasm ) * speak of “the wonderful noonday silence of a tropical forest,” which “ is, after all, due only to the dullness of our hearing; and could our ears catch the murmurs of these tiny maelstroms, as they whirl in the innumerable myriads of living cells which constitute each tree, we should be stunned as with the roar of a great city.” The telephone and the phonograph, moreover, are there to upset any theory except the vibratory one—however materialistically expressed. Hence, the attempt of the Substantialists “to show the fallacy of the wave-theory of sound as universally taught, and to outline the substantial theory of acoustics,” cannot be successful.

Everyone sees that metaphysics instead of being a science of first principles has now broken up into a number of more or less materialistic schools of every shade and colour, from Schopenhauer’s pessimism down to agnosticism, monism, idealism, hylo-idealism, and every “ism” with the exception of psychism—not to speak of true psychology. What Mr. Huxley said of Positivism, namely that it was Roman Catholicism minus Christianity, ought to be paraphrased and applied to our modern psychological philosophy. It is psychology, minus soul; psyche being dragged down to mere sensation; a solar system minus a sun; Hamlet with the Prince of Denmark not entirely cast out of the play, but in some vague way suspected of being probably somewhere behind the scenes."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"When a humble David seeks to conquer the enemy it is not the small fry of their army whom he attacks, but Goliath, their great leader.

The “monism” of Lewes, Bain and others, which endeavours so v ainly to compress all mental and material phenomena into the unity of One Substance, is in no way the transcendental monism of esoteric philosophy. The current “Single-Substance Theory” of mind and matter necessarily involves the doctrine of annihilation, and is hence untrue. Occultism, on the other hand, recognizes that in the ultimate analysis even the Logos and Mûlaprakriti are one; and that there is but One Reality behind the Mâyâ of the universe. But in the manvantaric circuit, in the realm of manifested being, the Logos (spirit), and Mûlaprakriti (matter or its noumenon), are the dual contrasted poles or bases of all phenomena—subjective and objective. The duality of spirit and matter is a fact, so long as the Great Manvantara lasts. Beyond that looms the darkness of the “Great Unknown,” the one Parabrahman. –––––––––– P SYCHOLOGY , THE S CIENCE OF THE S OUL  335 The mental act in which self is known implies, like every other mental act, a perceiving subject and a p e r c e iv e d o b j e c t. I f , th e n , th e object perceived is self, what is the subject that perceives? Or if it is the true self which thinks, what other self can it be that is thought of?* Clearly, a true cognition of self implies a self in which the knowing and the known are one—in which subject and object are identified; and this Mr. Mansel rightly holds to be the annihilation of both ! So that the personality of which each is conscious, and of which the existence is to each a fact beyond all others the most certain, is yet a thing which cannot truly be known at all; the knowledge of it is forbidden by the very nature of thought. † The italics are ours to show the point under discussion. Does this not remind one of an argument in favour of the undul a tory theory, namely, that “the meeting of two rays whose waves interlock produces darkness”? For Mr. Mansel’s assertion that when self thinks of self, and is simultaneously the subject and object, it is “the annihilation of both”—means just this, and the psychological argument is therefore placed on the same basis as the physical phenomenon of light waves. Moreover, Mr. Herbert Spencer confessing that Mr. Mansel is right and basing thereupon his conclusion that the knowledge of self or soul is thus “forbidden by the very nature of thought” is a proof that the “father of modern psychology” (in England) proceeds on no better psychological principles than Messrs.

We would fain impress on the minds of our Theosophists and mystics that to search for sympathy and recognition in the region of “science” is to court defeat. Psychology seemed a natural ally at first, and now having examined it, we come to the conclusion that it is a suggestio falsi and no more. It is as misleading a term, as taught at present, as that of the Antarctic Pole with its ever arid and barren frigid zone, called southern merely from geographical considerations. For the modern psychologist, dealing as he does only with the superficial brain-consciousness, is in truth more hopelessly materialistic than all-denying materialism itself,. the latter, at any rate, being more honest and sincere. Materialism shows no pretensions to fathom human thought, least of all the human spirit-soul, which it deliberately and coolly but sincerely denies and throws altogether out of its catalogue. But the psychologist devotes to soul his whole time and leisure. He is ever boring artesian wells into the very depths of human consciousness. The materialist or the frank atheist is content to make of himself, as Jeremy Collier puts it, “a very despicable mortal . . . . no better than a heap of organized dust, a stalking machine, a speaking head without a soul in it . . . whose thoughts are bound by the law of motion.” But the psychologist is not even a mortal, or even a man; he is a mere aggregate of sensations.* The universe and –––––––––– * According to John Stuart Mill neither the so-called objective universe nor the domain of mind—object, subject—corresponds with any a bsolute reality beyond “sensation.” Objects, the whole paraphernalia of sense, are “sensation objectively viewed,” and mental –––––––––– P SYCHOLOGY , THE S CIENCE OF THE S OUL  337 "},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"all in it is only an aggregate of grouped sensations, or \"an integration of sensations.\" It is all relations of subject and object, relations of universal and individual, of absolute and finite. But when it comes to dealing with the problems of the origin of space and time, and to the summing-up of all those inter- and co-relations of ideas and matter, of ego and non-ego, then all the proof vouchsafed to an opponent is the contemptuous epithet of “ontologist.” After which modern psychology having demolished the object of its sensation in the person of the contradictor, turns round against itself and commits harakiri by showing sensation itself to be no better than hallucination. This is even more hopeless for the cause of truth than the harmless paradoxes of the materialistic automatists. The assertion that “the physical processes in the brain are complete in themselves” concerns after all only the registrative function of the material brain; and unable to explain satisfactorily psychic processes thereby, the automatists are thus harmless to do permanent mischief. But the psychologists, into whose hands the science of soul has now so unfortunately fallen, can do great harm, inasmuch as they pretend to be earnest seekers after truth, and remain withal content to represent Coleridge’s “Owlet,” which— Sailing on obscene wings athwart the noon, Drops his blue-fring’d lids, and holds them close, And hooting at the glorious sun in heaven, Cries out, “Where is it?”* —and who more blind than he who does not want to see? –––––––––– states “sensation subjectively viewed.” The “Ego” is as entire an illusion as matter; the One Reality, groups of feelings bound together by th e rigid laws of association. * [These lines are from a poem entitled Fears in Solitude.

The former, moreover, in its latest development is half inclined to believe itself quite transcendental owing to the latest departure from the too brutal teachings of the Büchners and Moleschotts. But when one comes to analyze the difference between the two, it"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"appears so imperceptible that they almost merge into one. Indeed, the champions of science now say that the belief that sensations and thought are but movements of matter—Büchner’s and Moleschott’s theory—is, as a well-known English annihilationist remarks, “unworthy of the name of philosophy.” Not one man of science of any eminence, we are indignantly told, neither Tyndall, Huxley, Maudsley, Bain, Clifford, Spencer, Lewes, Virchow, Haeckel nor Du Bois-Reymond has ever gone so far as to say that “thought is a molecular motion, but that it is the concomitant [not the cause as believers in a soul maintain] of certain physical processes in the brain. . . .” They never—the true scientists as opposed to the false, the sciolists—the monists as opposed to the materialists—say that thought and nervous motion are the same, but that they are the “subjective and objective faces of the same thing.” Now it may be due to a defective training which has not enabled us to frame ideas of a subject other than those which answer to the words in which it is expressed, but we plead guilty to seeing no such marked difference between Büchner’s and the new monistic theories. “Thought is not a motion of molecules, but it is the concomitant of certain physical processes in the brain.” Now what is a concomitant, and what is a process? A concomitant, according to the best definitions, is a thing that accompanies, or is collaterally connected with another—a concurrent and simultaneous companion. P SYCHOLOGY , THE S CIENCE OF THE S OUL  339 A process is an act of proceedin g , an advance or motion, whether temporary or continuous, or a series of motions. Thus the concomitant of physical processes, being naturally a bird of the same feather, whether subjective or objective, and being due to motion, which both monists and materialists say is physical—what difference is there between their definition and that of Büchner, except perhaps that it is in words a little more scientifically expressed? Three scientific views are laid before us with regard to changes in thought by present-day philosophers: Postulate: “Every mental change is signalized by a molecular change in the brain substance.” To this: 1. Materialism says: the mental changes are caused by the molecular changes. 2. Spiritualism (believers in a soul): the molecular changes are caused by the mental changes. [Thought acts on the brain matter through the medium of Fohat focussed through one of the principles.] 3. Monism: there is no causal relation between the two sets of phenomena; the mental and the physical being the two sides of the same thing [a verbal evasion]. To this occultism replies that the first view is out of court entirely. It would enquire of No. 2: And what is it that presides so judicially over the mental changes? What is the noumenon of those mental phenomena which make up the external consciousness of the physical man?

This magazine was described on the title-page as a “ Revue de Hautes Études Théosophiques, tendant à favoriser le rapprochement entre l’Orient et l’Occident” (Review of Higher Theosophical Studies, intended to promote the mutual understanding of the Orient and the Occident). The Journal claimed to be “under the inspiration of H. P. Blavatsky.” It was edited by F. K. Gaboriau, and was started in March, 1887, at Paris. The opening article of the Abbé Roca appeared in Volume II, No. 9, December, 1887. It was followed in the same issue by H. P. B.’s Reply. The rejoinder of Abbé Roca appeared in February, 1888. H. P. B.’s second Reply was published in April, 1888. The Abbé took up the thread of the controversy once more in the issue of June, 1888, and H. P. B. appended to his article a large number of illuminating footnotes which closed the series. In the January, 1888, issue of Lucifer (Vol. I), H. P.

B.’s own translation, adding to it within square brackets our own translation of the passages omitted by H. P. B. The Abbé Roca's essay is immediately followed by H. P. B.’s reply, both in its original French and its English rendering. As far as the Abbé Roca is concerned, very little is known about him. There is no doubt that he was a very open-minded ecclesiastic, who intended to fight various abuses of the Roman Church, and was defrocked in due course of time for doing so. He had studied in his earlier years at the Carmelite School for Higher Studies, and eventually became Canon in the diocese of Perpignan, in the Pyrénées-Orientales province of France. He published three works before incurring the wrath of his superiors: Le Christ, le Pape et la Démocratie (Paris, 1884), La Crise fatale et le salut de l'Europe, and La Fin de l'ancien monde (Paris, 1886). The Congregation of the Index, in a communication dated September 19, 1888, hastened to advise the faithful that by reading these books they ran the risk of eternal damnation, and the Abbé was given a chance to retract his heretical views. He refused to do so. Consequently, the Bishop of Perpignan, acting on the 342  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS au thority of Pope Leo XIII, imposed on him the “suspense,” depriving him of the exercise of all his functions in Holy Orders, as a ls o of his living, for refusing to submit to the decree by which his works"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"were placed on the Index.* Undaunted, the Abbé announced the forthcoming appearance of his next work, entitled Glorieux Centenaire— 1889.— Monde nouveau.

No information has come to light concerning the later years of Abbé Roca’s life, in spite of repeated attempts to secure such from various sources.

All our dogmas will pass from “the letter which killeth” to “the spirit which giveth life,” from the mystic and sacramental to the scientific and rational form, perhaps even to the stage of experimental methods. The reign of faith, or mystery and miracles, is nearing its close; this is plain and was, moreover, predicted by Christ himself. Faith vanishes from the brains of men of science, to make way for the clear perception of the essential truths which had to be veiled at the origin of Christianity, under symbols and figures, so as to adapt them, as far as possible, to the needs and weaknesses of the infancy of our faith. Strange! It is at the very hour when Europe is attaining the age of reason, and when she is visibly entering upon the full possession of her powers, that India prepares to hand on to us those loftier ideas which exactly meet our new wants, as much from the intellectual, as from the moral, religious, social and other standpoints. One might believe that the “B ROTHERS” kept an eye from afar on the movements of Christendom, and that from the summits of their Himâ la yan watch towers, they had waited expectantly for the hour when they would be able to make us hear them with some chance of being understood.

Everyone knows whence comes the imminence of the catastrophe which threatens us; hitherto men have only evoked the animal needs, they have only awakened and unchained the brute forces of nature, the passional instincts, the savage energies of the lower Kosmos. Christianity does indeed conceal under the profound esotericism of its Parables, those truths, scientific, religious, and social, which this deplorable situation imperiously demands, but sad to say, sad indeed for a priest, hard, hard indeed for Christian ears to hear, all our priesthoods, that of the Roman Catholic Church equally with those of the Orthodox Russian, the Anglican, the Protestant, and the Anglo-American churches, seem struck with blindness and impotence in face of the glorious task which they would have to fulfil in these terrible circumstances. They see nothing; their eyes are plastered and their ears walled up. They do not discover; one is tempted to say, they do not even suspect what ineffable truths are hidden under the dead letter of their teachings. [What a spectacle they present to the world!

What Mr. Berthelot wrote in his last work on Chemistry is well known to the public: “The electric, magnetic, calorific and luminous fluids that were accepted at the beginning of the present century, as being at the basis of electricity, magnetism, heat and light, have indeed no more reality to the physicists of today, than the four elements, Water, Earth, Air and Fire, invented, in the time of the Ionians and of Plato, to correspond with liquidity, solidity, volatility and combustion. These imaginary fluids have had in the history of science an even shorter existence than the four elements; they have disappeared in less than a century and have been reduced to but one, namely, ether.

[Materialists are looking for the focus from which motion radiates—where it does not exist, i.e., in its effects. The so-called “Spiritual Christians,” on the other hand, seek it where it is not to be found either, outside of Nature, and, in their abstract speculations, they lose their way in absolutely hollow metaphysics wherein their vain ideas disappear. The First Cause of the world and of all the beings that inhabit it is not extrinsic to the creation; it is immanent in it, as intrinsic as the spirit is to matter which it animates and activates, while remaining perfectly distinct from it. Distances are not measured in the mental as they are in the physical where they are estimated by the compass and the yardstick; they are determined in the mental by separations like those which distinguish the natural kingdoms from each other, the mineral from the vegetable, the vegetable from the animal, and so forth.] –––––––––– II.—I can now, after these preliminaries, give an example of the transformation which, thanks to the Mahâtmans, will soon take place in the teaching of the Christian Church. I will take particularly the dogma of the Creation, informing my readers that they will find in a book I am preparing, New Heavens and New Earth, an analogous work on all the dogmas of the Catholic faith.

Re g arded from above, as the Easterns regard it, the universal substance presents the aspect of a spiritual or divine emanation; looked at from below, as the Westerners are in the habit of viewing it, it offers, on the contrary, the aspect of a material creation. One sees at once the difference which must exist between the two intellectualities and, consequently, between the two civilisations of the East and the West Yet there is no more error in the Genesis of Moses, which is that of the Christian teaching, than there is in the Genesis of the Mahâtmans, which is that of the Buddhist doctrine. The one and the other of these Geneses are absolutely founded on one and the same reality. Whether one descends or ascends the scale of being, one only traverses, in the East from above downwards, in the West from below upwards, the same ladder of essences, more or less spiritualised, more or less materialised, according as one approaches to, or recedes from, Pure Spirit, which is God. It was, therefore, not worth while to fulminate so much on one side or the other, here, against the theory of emanation, there, against the theory of Creation. One always comes back to the principle of Hermes Trismegistus: the universe is dual, though formed of a single substance. The Kabbalists knew it well, and it was taught long ago in the Egyptian sanctuaries, as the occultists have never ceased to repeat it in the temples of India. It will soon be demonstrated, I hope, by scientific experiments such as those of Mr. William Crookes, the Academician, that everywhere throughout all nature, spirit and matter are not two but one and that they nowhere offer a real division in life. Under every physical force there is a spiritual or a psychic force: in the heart of the minutest atom is hidden a vital soul, the presence of which has been perfectly determined by Claude Bernard in germs imperceptible to the naked eye. “This soul, human, animal, vegetable or mineral, is but a ray lent by the universal soul to every object manifested in the Kosmos.” “Corporeal man and the sensible universe, says the theosophical doctrine, are but the appearance imparted to them by t he cohesion of the inter-atomic or inter-astral forces which constitute both exteriorly. The visible side of a being is an ever-changing Mâyâ.” The language of St. Paul is in no way different: “The aspect of the world,” he says, “is a passing vision, an image which passes and renews itself continually— transit figura hujus mundi. ”* –––––––––– * [The Vulgate , I Cor ., vii, 31 has: Praeterit e n im figura hujus mundi — Compiler .] ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" 350  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS “The real man, or the microcosm— and one can say as much of the macrocosm—is an astral force which reveals itself through this physical appearance, and which, having existed before the birth of this form, does not share its fate at the hour of death: surviving its destruction. The material form cannot subsist without the spiritual force which sustains it; but the latter is independent of the former, for form is created by spirit, and not spirit by form.” This theory is word for word that of the “Brothers”and the Adepts, at the same time it is that of the Kabbalists and the Christians of the School of Origen, and the Johannine Church. There could not be a more perfect agreement. Transfer this teaching to the genesis of the Kosmos and you have the secret of the formation of the World; at the same time you discover the profound meaning of the saying of St. Paul: “The invisible things of God are made visible to the eye of man through the visible things of the creation,” * a saying so well translated by Joseph de Maistre as follows: “The world is a vast system of invisible things, visibly organised.” The whole of the Kosmos is like a two-faced medal of which both faces are alike. The materialists know only the lower side, while the occultists see it from both sides at once; from the front and from the back. It is always nature, and the same nature, but natura naturata from below, natura naturans from above; here, intelligent cause; there, brute effect; spiritual above, corporeal below, etherealised at the North, concreted at the South Pole. The distinction accepted everywhere in the West down to our own day, as essential and radical, between spirit on the one hand and matter on the other, is no longer sustainable. The progress of science, spurred on as it will be by Hindu ideas, will soon force the last followers of this infantile belief to abandon it as ridiculous. [Outside of God there is but one and the same substance in the universe (perhaps the Yliaster of Paracelsus or the Sat of the Hermetists) constituted, I say again, with two opposite poles, the North or Spiritual Pole, and the South or Material. Neither the old materialistic school nor the old spiritual school, in the limited sense still attached to those terms according to our former mental categories can defend themselves any longer against the victorious assaults that will be incessantly made upon them by real Theosophists, or more correctly, real Christians. –––––––––– * [More correctly, in Rom ., i, 20, thus: ”For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made. . . .”— Compiler. ] –––––––––– C ONTROVERSY WITH A BBÉ R OCA  351 Before our vision there is nothing positive and real except life, everywhere life, nothing but life; since life is in the Word, according to St. John, and the Word is, like God, present in all beings, which do not exist except by him. Nevertheless—and it is here that the Christian teaching seems to be superior, in its expression at least, to the Hindu teaching—nevertheless, I say, the life which the contingent beings live is not the life of God. In other words, which are those of St. Paul, God is not the motion, the being, the life, within us; but, rather, “ we have the motion, the being, the life, in God: in ipso enim vivimus, et movemur, et sumus ” ( Acts, xvii, 28). This expression, absolutely exact and clear, puts an end to all the fallacious syllogisms of Plotinus, Bruno,"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Spinoza, and the Stoics of all times.] Yes, all, absolutely all in the world is life, but life differently organised and variously manifested through phenomena which vary infinitely from the most spiritualised beings, such as the Angels, as well known to Buddhists as to Christians, though called by other names, down to the most solidified of beings, such as stones and metals. In the bosom of the latter, sleep, in a cataleptic condition, milliards of vital elementary spirits. These latter only await, to thrill into activity, the stroke of the pick or hammer to which they will owe their deliverance and their escape from the limbus, of which the Hindu doctrine speaks as well as the Catholic. Here lies, for these souls of life, the starting point of the Resurrection and the Ascension, taught equally by both the Eastern and the Western traditions, but not understood among us. [The quarryman’s pickaxe, the farmer’s plough, the woodcutter’s axe, the horseshoe, the carriage-wheel, every moment are bringing about these awakenings, en masse; and the fires of our furnaces in reducing ores, decomposing coal and wood, fling into the air whirling clouds of elementary spirits. Prisoners of wood, of stone, and of iron, enchained, shackled therein like Lazarus in his tomb, they are awaiting the hour when the bonds of their captivity will be severed, and that is how, according to St. Paul, all Nature, pregnant with life and seminal force, groans and sighs for its deliverance and final release from the pains of labor; omnis creatura ingemiscit, et parturit usque adhuc ( Rom., viii, 22). It is in the pains of a perpetual delivery. How have these vital energies been struck with catalepsy and reduced to a state which is neither that of a corpse in the sepulchre nor that of an embryo in the womb, nor even that of the larvae entangled in the thick bonds of matter? Formerly it was a mystery as we said in our seminaries and from the heights of our Christian pulpits; in our days it is a new chapter in biology, as will be seen in the explanation I shall give of the Dogma of the Original Fall according 352  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS to the principles of the Hindu teachings and the Kabbalistic teachings of Judeo-Christianity. I need not linger on that here. The question to be f ully understood is, how one single substance (the Yliaster or Sat, the name is immaterial) can be enough for the constitution of all the beings that people the visible and invisible Universe. More or less subtilized at the North Pole, in that which we call Heaven, more or less condensed at the South Pole, in what we call the Earth, or better, Hell, that substance undergoes infinite modifications owing to its passing and repassing through the thousands of alembics, retorts, crucibles, and cuppels, of which the laboratory of that incomparable chemist, called “ naturing ” Nature , is composed. Here, the metals, sublimated by fire, are transformed into vapor; there, the same vapors, condensed by cold, rebecome hard bodies. The organic apparatus, by means of which the spirit acts, differs from one kingdom to another; that is why its action and its effects differ also; truly, spirit aggregates in the mineral, grows with the plants, creeps, walks and runs with the animals, swims with the fishes, flies with the birds; it is the marvellous instinct in the bee, the ant, the beaver, in all the skilful, ingenious species. It passes from the depths to the heights of the entire region of animal life until it reaches full unfolding in the intelligence and genius of man, wherefrom it springs, radiant to the angelic spheres. A new career then opens before him, he ascends the orders which form the nine choirs of angels, and so enters into the harmonious Nirvâna of the Mahâtmans, which is nothing else, I believe, than the bosom of Abraham of the ancient Law, and, since the Gospel, the bosom of the glorious Christ, “that Social-Divine body” of which we are called to constitute the living monads, the organic cells.] But as they ascend, so the spirits can also descend, for they are always free to transfigure themselves in"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"the divine light, or to bury themselves in the satanic shadow of error and evil. Hence, while time is time, “these ceaseless tears and gnashings of teeth” of which the gospel Parables speak metaphorically, and which will last as long as shall last the elaboration of the social atoms destined for the collective composition of the beatific Nirvâna. Nature is ever placing under our eyes examples of organic transformations, analogous to those I am speaking of, as if to aid us in comprehending our own destiny. But it seems that many men “have eyes in order not to see,” as Jesus said. See how in order to remove these cataracts, science, even in the West, constantly approaching more and more that of the East, is at work producing in its turn phenomena, which corroborate at once the Parables of the Gospels and the teachings of nature. I will not speak of the Salpêtrière and the marvels of hypnotism in the hands of Monsieur Charcot and his numerous disciples throughout the whole world. There are things which strike me even more. C ONTROVERSY WITH A BBÉ R OCA  353 Monsieur Pictet, at Geneva, is creating diamonds with air and light. This should not astonish those who know that our coal mines are n o thing but “stored-up sunlight.” With an even more marvellous industry, do not the flowers extract from the atmosphere the luminous substance of which they weave their fine and joyous garments? And “all that is sown in the earth under a material form does it not rise under a spiritual form,” as St. Paul says? * The glorious entities, which we call celestial spirits, have themselves an organic form. It is defined in the canons of our dogma, whatever the ignorance-mongers of ultramontanism may pretend. God alone has no body, God alone is pure Spirit— and even to speak thus we must consider the Deity apart from the person of Jesus Christ, for in the “ Word made flesh ” God dwells corporeally, according to the true and beautiful saying of St. Paul. And it is because God has no body that he is present everywhere in the infinite, under the veils of cosmic light and ether, which serve as his garment and under the electric, magnetic, inter-atomic, interplanetary, inter-stellar and sound fluids, which serve him as vehicles. And it is also because God has no created form that the Kabbala could, without error, call him Non-Being. Hegel probably felt this esoteric truth when he spoke, in his heavy and cumbrous language, of the equivalence of Being and Non-Being. All visible forms are thus the product, at the same time as they are the garment and the manifestation, of spiritual forces. All sensible order is, in reality, an organic concretion, a sort of living crystallisation of intelligent powers fallen from the state of spirituality into the state of materiality; in other words, fallen from the North to the South pole of nature, in consequence of a catastrophe called by Holy Scripture the Fall from Eden. This cataclysm was the punishment of a frightful crime, of an audacious revolt spoken of in the traditions of all Temples and called in our dogma original sin. The primary priesthood of the Christian church has hitherto lacked the light needed to explain this biological phenomenon, which is an ascertained fact of physiology and sociology, as I hope to prove. Questioned on this point, the priests have always replied: It is a mystery. Now there are no mysteries save for ignorance, and the Christ announced that \"every hidden thing should be brought to light, and proclaimed on the house-tops”.† This is why so many new lights, coming from the East and elsewhere, enter scientifically, in our day, into the Christian mind. ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"* [Paraphrase of I Cor ., xv, 53-54.] † [Paraphrase of Luke , xii, 13 .] –––––––––– 354  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Glo ry to the Theosophists, glory to the Adepts, glory to the Kabbalists, glory above all to the Hermetists everywhere, glory to those ne w missionaries whose coming Monsieur de Maistre foresaw, and whom Monsieur de Saint-Yves d’Alveydre lately hailed as the elect of God, charged by him to establish a communion of knowledge and of love between all the religious centres of the earth!

Examinez aussi les murs intérieurs du Sanctum Sanctorum dans le temple de Luxor, bâti par ce même Pharaon, et vous allez y voir quatre scènes fort significatives: c’est d’abord le Dieu Thot (le Mercure lunaire, le Messager de l’Anonciation des Dieux égyptiens, le Gabriel du Livre des Morts ) saluant la Reine Vierge et lui annonçant la naissance d’un fils; ensuite, c’est le Dieu Kneph aidé de Hathor (le SaintEsprit sous ses deux aspects, masculin et féminin, comme la Sophie des Gnostiques dont le Saint-Esprit est la transformation), préparant et disposant le germe de l’enfant à venir; puis la mère en travail, assise sur le tabouret de la sage-femme qui reçoit le nouveau-né, dans une grotte; et, en dernier lieu, la sccne de l’adoration.

Lorsque le lieu de naissance solaire se trouvait dans le signe du Taureau, Orion était l’astre qui se levait à l’Orient pour dire le jour ou le Dieu-solaire venait de renaître; de la le nom de cet astre, I’Étoile d’Horus; c’était l’Étoile des trois rois mages, qui saluait l’enfant; aujourd’hui encore, dans la constellation d’Orion, la ceinture porte le nom populaire de: les Trois Rois. Et notre auteur ajoute: Plutarque nous dit comment le culte Mithraïque fut établi à Rome vers l’an 70 avant l’ère Chrétienne. Mithra, à ce que l’on rapporte , est né dans une caverne. Partout où son culte fut accepté, une caverne était consacrée pour la cérémonie de sa nativité. On sait ce que veut dire cette caverne, et la date précise des époques auxquelles la naissance des divers Messies ou Christos avait lieu est fixée définitivement et mathématiquement. C’était le lieu où naissait le soleil, pendant le solstice d’hiver, alors que ce point coincidait, le 25 décembre, avec le signe du Capricorne, l’équinoxe du printemps étant dans le signe du Bélier. Le nom que les Akkades donnaient au dixième mois, celui du Capricorne, . . . . était Abba Uddu , ou «la caverne de la lumière», c’est-à-dire le lieu de naissance du soleil dans les profondeurs du solstice. . . . Cette caverne devint ainsi le lieu de la Nativité du Christ; vous la trouverez dans tous les «Évangiles de l’enfance»; Justin le martyr dit que «le Christ est né dans une étable et a trouvé refuge dans une caverne». Il certifie aussi le fait que le Christ est né le jour même où le Soleil renaissait dans les étables d’Augias ( Stabula Augiae ) . Or, le nettoyage de ces étables était le sixième labeur d’Hercule, son premier étant dans le signe du Lion. Et Justin avait raison; I’étable et la caverne sont figurées toutes deux dans le même signe céleste. Mais notez bien ceci: cette caverne était le lieu de naissance du Messie-Solaire depuis l’an 2,410, jusqu’à l’an 255 avant l’ère chrétienne, époque à laquelle le solstice passait du signe du Capricorne à celui du Sagittaire, et aucun Messie, que nous l’appellions Mithra, Adon, Tammuz, Horus ou le Christ, ne pouvait plus naître dans la caverne d’ Abba Uddu, ou les Étables d’Augias, le 25 décembre après l’an 255 précédant notre ère. –––––––––– * Les Égyptiens portaient le nouveau-né dans sa crèche à travers les rues d’Alexandrie. –––––––––– « L ’ É S O T É R I S M E D U D O G M E C H R É T I E N »  3 6 5 D onc. . . . .

B. uses here a very unusual word, namely, auxis, which cannot be found in that form in any French Dictionary of today. It must have fallen into disuse a century or more ago. However, in an old French work written by the celebrated astronomer Joseph Jérôme Le Français de Lalande (1732-1807) and entitled Astronomie (Paris, 1764, 2 vols.; enl. ed., Paris, 1771-81, 4 vols.; 3rd ed., Paris, P. Didot, 1792, 3 vols.), there is an analytical Table of Contents wherein occurs under the term apside the rare word aux, signifying, according to the author, “à-peu-près la même chose” as does the word apside. In astronomy, the term apsis is used to denote, in an orbit, the point at which the distance of the body from the center of attraction is either greatest (higher apsis) or least (lower apsis), as the apogee or perigee of the moon, or the aphelion or perihelion of a planet, such as the earth, for instance. The line joining the two apsides is called the line of apsides. There is little doubt that the terms auxis and aux are closely related to each other, both being derivatives from the Greek auxêsis, growth, increase, increment; auxêin, to grow, to increase; and Auxêsia, the goddess of growth. The term used in Greek for the waxing moon was auxo-selênon. Our own word auxiliary is derived from the same root. While the apsides or the line joining them do not play any direct role in what is known as the precession of the equinoxes, it is nevertheless fairly clear that H. P. B. uses the old term auxis in the sense of progressive alteration, increase, increment, progression, and thus applies it to the fact of the precessional motion.— Compiler. ] 3 6 6  B L A V A T S K Y : C O L L E C T E D W R I T I N G S a i nsi qu’à la Révélation de sain t Jean, et quand ces deux livres furent acceptés, ce fut, comme il est définitivement prouvé , sous une forme mutilée. Sans cela, le grand ennemi de saint Pierre n’eût fait qu’une bouchée de l’apôtre de la Circoncision. Voilà pourquoi à cette phrase alléguée du «Verbe fait chair», les Théosophes—Gnostiques et Bouddhistes—pourraient opposer cette autre sentence de Paul demandant aux Galatéens s’ils sont assez fous, après avoir commencé par la foi en l’Esprit, pour retomber dans leur croyance en un dieu corporel; car tel est le sens ésotérique de ce qu’il dit dans son Epitre aux Gal., iii, 3, etc. Autre chose extraordinaire, et que M. l’abbé Roca devrait bien nous expliquer. Il paraîtrait, d’après tous les calculs, que Paul a été converti au Christ trois ou quatre ans avant la crucification de Jésus ! Ainsi, d’après les Actes, sa vision daterait de l’an 30 ou 31; mais d’après ce qu’il dit encore aux Galatéens, elle aurait eu lieu en l’annéc 27. Il dit, en effet, ne pas être allé à Jérusalem pendant les trois années qui ont suivi sa conversion (chap. i, 18 et suiv.); après quoi, il dit (chap. ii, 1 et suiv.) s’y être rendu encore quatorze ans plus tard, avec Barnabas et Titus. Or, «la date de cette seconde visite, au moins, sinon de la première, peut être fixée historiquement, car elle se fit pendant la grande famine que l’on sait avoir eu lieu l’an 44, lorsque Paul et Barnabas envoyèrent des secours aux pauvres». Si donc l’on déduit 17 de cette date de 44, il s’ensuit que saint Paul était converti en l’an 27, c’est-à-dire lorsque Jésus vivait encore! Et cela ne s’explique que si, comme le"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"prouve M.

Ce crime effroyable n’était que le résultat naturel de la loi de l’évolution; ce sont les races, à peine consolidées d’abord, de nos prototypes androgynes et semi -éthérées se matérialisant peu à peu, prenant un corps physique, puis se scindant en mâles et femelles distincts et, finalement, procréant charnellement après qu’elles avaient autrefois créé leurs semblables par des procédés tout autres qui seront expliqués un jour (si toutefois l’on peut exprimer par le mot créer l’idée toute contraire à celle d’engendrer) Cette «révolte audacieuse», c’est encore une allégorie anthropomorphe et personnificatrice due à l’Église qui a matérialisé, pour les mieux déguiser, toutes les idées anciennes —vieilles comme le monde. Celle-ci était un dogme philosophique fixé dans la signification ésotérique de la légende de Prométhée. Le feu sacré qu’il dérobe aux Dieux, c’est d’abord la flamme de l’intellect conscient, l’étincelle qui anime le cinquième principe, ou Manas; c’est encore la flamme génératrice et sexuelle; cette étincelle, est le reflet—sinon l’essence même—des Archanges, ou Monades, forcés par leur karma du manvantara précédent, de s’incarner dans les formes astrales de la troisième grande race préadamique avant sa «chute»—la chute de l’ Esprit dans la Matière. Cette prétendue «révolte», ce «vol» du feu créatif, sont eux-mêmes un résultat de l’Évolution —(dont la théorie Darvinienne n’est que l’enveloppe grossière, sur le plan physique ou matériel). Une fois doués du feu créateur, les hommes évolués entièrement n’eurent plus besoin de l’aide des Puissances ou Dieux créateurs tels que les Elohim du chap. ii de la Genèse. Ils devinrent Dieux créateurs à leur tour, capables de donner la vie à des êtres comme eux; d’où l’allégorie grecque d’Ouranos mutilé par Saturne-Kronos qui, à son tour, se voit mutilé par son fils Jupiter; l’allusion est fort transparente: puisque les hommes avaient surpris, grâce à Prométhée, le secret des divers modes de la création et créaient à leur tour, à quoi bon les dieux créateurs? 368  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS "},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Ce soi-disant vol du feu créateur est, d’après Enoch, le crime dont se rendirent coupables ces anges tombés, dont l’Église a fait Satan et son armée.

Sat est un mot sanscrit, en usage dans la philosophie du védanta; c’est un adjectif, intraduisible dans aucune langue; ni substance, ni pur Esprit, ni même quelque chose, Sat est le Tout infini, la V IE ou plutôt l’Existence ABSOLUE qu’on ne pourrait traduire ni par le verbe «être» (Eheieh),* ni par le verbe «vivre» , dont le s Kabbalistes ont fait un glyphe de l’existence en le transmutant en douze manières différentes sans que le sens en soit altéré et l’appliquant à leur Jéhovah.

Sabeism and Heliolatry are therein intimately linked to that other mystery, the Incarnation of the Word or the descent into the human race of the divine Fiat, symbolized in the story of Elohim-Jehovah and the Adam of clay. Hence, psychology and astrolatry (whence astronomy) cannot be separated therein.

There can be no question, then, of a common “Shepherd” unless that Shepherd be entirely metaphorical.

Western Theosophists accept the Christos as did the Gnostics of the centuries which preceded Christianity, as do the Vedântins their Krishna: they distinguish the corporeal man from the divine Principle which, in the case of the Avatâra, animates him. Their Krishna, the historical hero, is mortal, but the divine Principle (Vishnu) which animates him, is immortal and eternal; Krishna— the man and his name—remains terrestrial at his death; –––––––––– Whether it be Krishna, Buddha, Sosiosh, Horus or Christos, it is a universal principle; the “God-Men” are of all perio d s and innumerable. –––––––––– E SOTERICISM OF C HRISTIAN D OGMA  375 he does not become Vishnu; Vishnu abso r bs only that part of himself which had animated the Avatâra, as it animates so many others.

The room is open to the sky, and because of the orientation the left end of the West Wall never gets the full rays of the sun, and is therefore difficult to photograph. The walls were much defaced during the Amarna religious revolution, and while restorations were made under Seti I, they are still in extremely poor condition. The story on the West Wall consists of three rows of pictures. It begins at the bottom right-hand corner and proceeds leftwards to the end of the wall; it is then continued in the middle row immediately above the last scene—the moulding of the Child and his Ka by the potter or creative god Khnum—and proceeds to the right; finally, it is resumed at the left hand of the topmost row, and ends at the extreme right.

Is it when the latter, openly declaring themselves Christians, started drowning the gods of the heathens in torrents of human blood, in the name of Him who had preached to them, as they said, brotherly and universal love, even to their enemies, charity unto forgiveness, and the forgetting of injuries? Or is it in those centuries when the Holy Inquisition ruled, that humanity enjoyed its golden Age, its universal peace, material or moral?

These famous Gnostics, they tell us, separated themselves from the Church because they could not agree to accept a Christ made flesh , and thus began the process of carnalizing the Christ-principle.

Therefore, to eliminate any possibility of confusion, it should be pointed out that it was Jehoshua (or Joshua) Ben Perahiah who was compromised in the revolt against Jannaeus, and fled to Egypt with the young Jehoshua Ben Pandira. Gerald Massey, in a letter to the Medium and Daybreak, a London weekly, gives an account of his historical researches on this important subject, from which the following paragraphs are quoted in The Theosophist, Vol. V, Suppl. to June, 1884, pp. 84-85: “The Christian cult did not commence with our Canonical Gospels, nor with a personal founder supposed to be therein portrayed. “The Jehoshua of the Talmud was undoubtedly an historical character. According to a tradition preserved in the Toledoth Jehoshua, he was related to Queen Salome, the wife and later widow of King Jannaeus, who reigned from the year 106 to 79 B.C . She is said to have tried to protect Jehoshua from his sacerdotal enemies, because she had been a witness of his wonderful works. One Jewish account asserts that this man, who is not to be named, was a disciple of Jehoshua ben-Perachia. It also says he was born in the fourth year of the reign of Alexander Jannaeus, notwithstanding the assertions of his followers that he was born in the reign of Herod. That is about a century earlier than the Christian era, which is supposed to have been dated from the birth of Christ. Jehoshua is described as being the son of Pandira and of Stada, the Strayed One. “The Rabbi ben-Perachia is likewise an historical character. He had begun to teach in the year 154 B.C .; therefore he was not born later than 180 to 170 B.C .

This was about the year 105 B.C .; and as Jehoshua ben-Pandira accompanied the Rabbi as his pupil, he may have been born as early as 120 B.C . We learn from Tract Shabbath, of the Babylonian Gemara to the Mishna, that Jehoshua ben-Pandira was stoned to death as a wizard in the city of Lud or Lydda, and was afterwards crucified by being hung upon the tree on the eve of the Passover. Another tradition records that Jehoshua was put to death during the reign of Salome, which ended in the year 71 B.C. “Jehoshua is the sole historical Jesus known either to the Jews or the Christians.

The traditions further show that Jehoshua was a Nazarene in reality, and not because he was born at Nazareth, which never could have constituted any one a Nazarene! “Now the Book Abodazura contains a comment on the Apostle James, in which it describes him as ’a follower of Jehoshua the Nazarene,’ whom I have shown to be that ‘other Jesus,’ who was not the Jesus or Christ of Paul.

It is hardly necessary to repeat again that which other Mahâtmans, the Hierophants of Egypt, repeated every 19 years, according to the Metonic Cycle, five or six thousand years, at least, before the XIX th century. The astronomical Christos can hav e but one anniversary of birth and of resurrection in 19 years, as shown by Gerald Massey, because his parents are the Sun and the Moon, the heavenly bodies which accompany “the Man crucified in Space,” which images preceded even the figure described by Plato.

The “Cave of Mithras” was the birthplace of the Sun in the Winter Solstice, when this occurred on the 25th of December in the sign of the Sea-Goat, with the Vernal Equinox in the sign of the Ram. Now the Akkadian name of the tenth month, that of the Sea-Goat, which answers roughly to our December, the tenth by name, is Abba Uddu, that is, the “Cave of Light”; the cave of re-birth for the Sun in the lowest depth at the Solstice, figured as the Cave of Light. . . . . This cave was continued as the birthplace of the Christ. You will find it in all the Gospels of the Infancy, and Justin Martyr says, “Christ was born in the Stable, and afterwards took refuge in the Cave.” He likewise vouches for the fact that Christ was born on the same day that the Sun was re-born in Stabula Augiae, or, in the Stables of Augias. Now the cleansing of this Stable was the sixth labour of Heracles, his first being in the sign of the Lion; and Justin was right; the Stable and Cave are both figured in the same Celestial Sign. But mark this! The cave was the birthplace of the Solar Messiah from the year 2410 to the year 255 B.C .; at which later date the Solstice passed ou t of the Sea-Goat into the sign of the Archer; and no Messiah, whether called Mithras, Adon, Tammuz, Horus or Christ, could have been born in the Cave of Abba Uddu or the Stable of Augias on the 25th of December after the year 255 B.C ., therefore Justin had nothing but the Mithraic tradition of the by-gone birthday to prove the birth of the Historical Christ 255 years later!‡ Thus, with mathematics and astronomy to help us, it has been demonstrated that Jesus could not have been born Decemb e r 25, 255 years later; the Precession of the Equinoxes, or the Sidereal increment forbids it.§ –––––––––– * [ Op. cit ., p. 7.] † [ Lives: Life of Pompey, ch. 24.] ‡ [Massey, op. cit. , pp. 6-7.] § [ Vide Compiler’s footnote on page 365 of this Volume.] –––––––––– “E SOTERICISM OF C HRISTIAN D OGMA ”  38 5"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":" It is in this ancient wisdom, and in the Christos of the Gnostics under its various names, that the Theosophists, disciples of the Mahâtmans, believe. Is the Abbé Roca ready to make the Pope accept this belief, and to accept it himself?—I doubt it. What, then, can we do? The Abbé Roca quotes us passages from Paul speaking of the “Word made flesh” and of a God existing corporeally; but the Abbé Roca is too learned to deny that the Epistles of St. Paul have not come down to us entirely immaculate. For several centuries the Church refused them a place among orthodox scriptures, as it did also the Revelation of St. John, and when these two books were accepted, they were, as is definitely proved, in a mutilated form. But for that, the great enemy of St. Peter would have made but one mouthful of the apostle of the circumcision. That is why, to the expression advanced, “the Word made flesh,” Theosophists—Gnostic and Buddhist—could oppose these other words of Paul’s asking whether the Galatians are foolish enough—after beginning with faith in Spirit—to fall back into a belief in a corporeal god; for that is the esoteric meaning of what he says in his Epistle to the Galatians, iii, 3, etc. There is another extraordinary thing which the Abbé Roca really ought to explain to us. It would appear, from every calculation, that Paul had been converted to Christ three or four years before the crucifixion of Jesus ! Thus, according to the Acts, his vision dated from the year 30 or 31, but according to what he also told the Galatians, it must have occurred in the year 27. He said, in fact, that he had not gone to Jerusalem for three years after his conversion ( Gal ., i, 18 et seq .), and after this he spoke ( Ibid., ii, 1 et seq .) of returning there fourteen years later, with Barnabas and Titus. Now, “the date of that second visit at least, if not of the first, can be historically fixed, because it was made during the great famine that is known to have occurred in the year 44, when Paul and Barnabas sent relief to the poor.” If then we subtract 17 from the date of 44, it follows that St. Paul was converted in the year 27, that is, while Jesus still lived! And that 386  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS can hardly be explained unless , a s Gerald Massey proves (thus corroborating the facts taught in the secret books of the Gnosis—see Isis Unveiled, Vol. II),* Paul had been converted, not to Jesus of Nazareth, but to the Christos of the Gnostics. In his Epistles he has been made to fulminate against the heretics, but these heretics were actually Peter, James, and the other Apostles. I am ignorant of what the erudite Abbé Roca intends to disclose to the world in his next volume on the subject of the “Fall from Eden” which he regards as a cataclysm, “punishment of a frightful crime, of an audacious revolt”; but I can assure him that the opinion of the “Theosophists-Chelas” upon the subject is already formed in advance.

Once endowed with the creative fire, completely evolved mankind had no further need for the help of the Powers or creative Gods, such as the Elohim of chapter ii of Genesis. Men became creative Gods, in their turn, able to give life to beings like themselves; whence the Greek allegory of Ouranos mutilated by Saturn-Kronos, who in turn finds himself mutilated by his son Jupiter; the allusion is perfectly transparent; since men had discovered, thanks to Prometheus, the secret of the various methods of creation, and were creating in their turn, what was the use of god-creators? The so-called theft of the creative fire is, according to Enoch, the crime which caused the guilt of the fallen angels, of whom the Church has made Satan and his Host. The Abbé Roca tells us again of the “ Sat of the Hermetists,” but he commits a double error in attributing that “Sat” to the Hermetists, who had never heard of it, and in calling it “Substance” like the Yliaster of Paracelsus. Sat is a Sanskrit term, used in the philosophy of the Vedânta; it is an adjective untranslatable into any language; neither substance nor pure Spirit, nor even any thing, Sat is the infinite All, L IFE , or rather ABSOLUTE Existence, which cannot be translated either by the verb “to be” (Eheieh),* or by the verb “to live” , of wh ich the Kabbalists have made a glyph of existence by transmuting it in a dozen different ways without the meaning ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"* [According to Wm.

Sat is the Absolute, or Parabrahm—and where is the Vedântin who would ever allow himself to call “spirit” Parabrahm, or the neuter Brahma!—while the Yliaster of Paracelsus is only the Anima Mundi; it is not even Mûlaprakriti, which is the “veil of Parabrahm” (literally, the root of Nature ) but simply the Âkâ ś a, the noumenon of the Astral Light, the veil between the Earth and the first waters. To the ecclesiastical religion of Christianity which has materialized everything, which has carnalized the Logos or Word, which, out of the unknown God of St. Paul, has made an anthropomorphic being, our S AT would never be either comprehensible or acceptable; our Sat, of which Ain-Soph, the negative divinity of the Kabbalists, is merely a pale metaphysical copy. As a Roman Catholic, the Abbé Roca tells us that, “ outside of God, there exists in the universe but one and the same substance,” whatever that may be. Disciples of the Mahâtmans, the Theosophists answer him: we reject a conditioned and limited God, though he would have outside of himself but one mathematical point! We are not looking for a dwarf-God, a God endowed with human attributes, made in the image of man; above all, we do not want a God fashioned by the mortal architects of a Church which has had the audacity to proclaim itself infallible! The Divinity that we acknowledge, we who hardly dare to formulate an adumbration of its conception, is God-the A LL , absolute, infinite, without beginning or end; the omnipresent divinity, of which the only W ORD that can be “made flesh” is Humanity! And that Word, which corporeal mankind—especially that mankind found under the aegis of the Churches—crucifies constantly and without intermission, that Word is resurrected only in that man who is sufficiently liberated from bonds tied by mortal hands, no longer to make for himself an earthly idol, either of the Church—the statue with feet of clay—or the world—the Satan who never renounces his pomp and works! The Christos which Theosophists, thus liberated, have acknowledged, ever since the secula seculorum , is the spiritual “E SOTERICISM OF C HRISTIAN D OGMA ”  389 Ego, glorious and triumphant over the flesh. But, as the allegory of the Four Evangelists"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"shows, the Son, from his resurrection, ascends to heaven to be forever one with the Father. Does that mean that we should accept the “miracle” of the Ascension as applied to the resurrected body of a man who has been made into a God? Does it mean that a fact so supernatural has ever taken place in the history of mankind? No! We absolutely reject such an interpretation, we reject that dogma which degrades the great mystery of universal Unity,* because, as far as we are concerned, we explain it quite differently: Once united to his Âtman-Christos, the Ego, by that very act, loses the great illusion called ego-ism, and perceives at last the fullness of truth; that Ego knows that it has never lived outside the great All, and that it is inseparable from it. Such is Nirvâna, which, for it, is but the return to its primitive condition or state. Imprisoned in its oubliette † of flesh and matter, it had lost even the conception or memory of that condition, but once the light of Spirit has revealed to it the illusion of the senses, it places no more trust in earthly things, for it has learned to scorn them; the Son is now united to the Father; thenceforth the soul is one with Spirit! And when a man has reached this point in the Gnosis, or Theosophy, what has he then to do with the dogmas of any Church? As to the Church, it has always made mysteries, and as the Abbé says very correctly, “mysteries exist only for the ignorant”; furthermore, is it not Christ himself who is made by the Catholic Church to say: “. . . that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops” [ Luke, xii, 3]. And what is that, but a repetition of the commandment of Gautama the Buddha: “Go and proclaim on the housetops of the –––––––––– * The legend of the Ascension is merely an allegory as old as the world; to believe in it one would have also to admit the authenticity of the ascension of Elijah carried alive into cosmic space, himself, his horses and his chariot. † [Underground dungeon or cell where the prisoner was deliberately forgotten.— Compiler .] –––––––––– 390  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS pa riahs, and in broad daylight, t h e mysteries of the Brâhmanas which they have kept secret in their temples. They have done so for love of power, for control of` the blind, and to usurp the prerogatives of the Devas (Gods).” What the Brâhmanas were doing when Siddhârtha Buddha came to deliver the people from the yoke of that caste, the Roman Church has done to this very day in the West; Theosophists will bring to light the mysteries of the Catholic Church, which are really those of the BrâhmaŠas , although under other names; in doing so, they will merely follow the commandments of the two great Mahâtmans: Gautama of Kapilavastu and Jesus of Judaea. Both of them had found their “Christos,” the eternal Truth, and both, being Sages and Initiates, proclaimed the same truths. We all thank the Abbé Roca for his brave and generous words; we do not doubt that such priests as he, who have the courage to translate “the dead letter” of the symbolic texts and proclaim the esoteric truths “upon the housetops,” may be ready to follow the way of"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Truth, the Light which they find on their path. Honor to such! But we are not as optimistic, however, as he is. Though the Church sees its greatest “mysteries” unmasked and proclaimed by scholars of every country who are versed in Orientalism and Symbology, or by Theosophists, we cannot believe that it will ever accept our truths; we believe still less that it will ever confess its errors. And, as on their part, true Theosophists will never accept either a Christ made Flesh, according to the Roman dogma, or an anthropomorphic God, still less a “Shepherd” in the person of a Pope, it is not they who will move towards “the Mountain of Salvation”; they will wait till the Roman Mohammed takes the trouble of starting on the road which leads to Meru.* Will that ever take place? I leave that to the reader to judge for himself. One last word! The Abbé Roca also speaks of the triple meaning canonically accorded to and recognized in the –––––––––– * The sacred mountain, abode of the Devas.—Editor, Le Lotus. –––––––––– “E SOTERIC I SM OF C HRISTIAN D OGMA ”  391 B iblical texts by his Church.

When the Roman Church, or its adherents, shall have acknowledged and studied the four keys (or meanings) which they lack, it will be possible to set about prophesying. Until then, let us try, at least, not to kill each other, if it is not really possible for us to love each other. The future is the greatest of the mysteries and those who have, like Prometheus, the gift of seeing into the Future, reveal the coming mysteries but to a small minority.

P. B. when he met her for the first time in London, in the Spring of 1887, soon after her arrival from Ostende. Even though this text is not from H. P. B.’s own pen, it is published here as it contains a great many points of teaching, and bears obvious marks of authenticity.— Compiler .] “I understand, Socrates. It is because you say that you always have a divine sign. So he is prosecuting you for introducing new things into religion. And he is going into court knowing that such matters are easily misrepresented to the multitude, and consequently meaning to slander you there.” —P LATO . I first met dear old “H. P. B.,” as she made all her friends call her, in the spring of 1887. Some of her disciples had t a ken a pretty house in Norwood, where the huge glass nave and twin towers of the Crystal Palace glint above a labyrinth of streets and terraces. London was at its grimy best. The squares and gardens were scented with grape-clusters of lilac, and yellow rain of laburnums under soft green leaves. The eternal smoke-pall was thinned to a gray veil shining in the afternoon sun, with the great Westminster Towers and a thousand spires and chimneys piercing through. Every house had its smoke-wreath, trailing away to the east. H. P. B. was just finishing her day’s work, so I passed a half-hour upstairs with her volunteer secretary, a disciple who served her with boundless devotion, giving up everything for her cause, and fighting her battles bravely, to be stormed at in return, unremittingly for seven years. I had known him two years before, in the days of Mohini Chatterji, the velvet-robed Brahman with glossy tresses and dusky face and big luminous eyes. So we talked of HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY  393 o l d t i m e s , a n d o f H . P . B .’ s g r e a t b o o k , The Secret Doctrine, and he read me resonant stanzas about Universal Cosmic Night, when Time was not; about the Luminous Sons of Manvantaric Dawn; and the Armies of the Voice; about the Water Men Terrible and Bad,"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"and the Black Magicians of Lost Atlantis; about the Sons of Will and Yoga and the Ring Pass-Not; about the Great Day Be-With-Us, when all shall be perfected into one, re-uniting “thyself and others, myself and thee.” So the half-hour passed, and I went downstairs to see the Old Lady. She was in her writing-room, just rising from her desk, and clad in one of those dark blue dressing-gowns she loved. My first impression was of her rippled hair as she turned, then her marvellously potent eyes, as she welcomed me: “My dear fellow! I am so glad to see you! Come in and talk! You are just in time to have some tea!” And a hearty handshake. Then a piercing call for “Louise,” and her Swiss maid appeared, to receive a voluble torrent of directions in French, and H. P. B. settled herself snugly into an armchair, comfortably near her tobacco-box, and began to make me a cigarette. The cuffs of a Jaeger suit showed round her wrists, only setting off the perfect shape and delicacy of her hands, as her deft fingers, deeply stained with nicotine, rolled the white rice-paper round Turkish tobacco. When we were comfortably alight, she told me a charming tale of Louise’s devotion. She had got away from her base of supplies somewhere, in Belgium I think, and things were rather tight for a while. A wealthy gentleman called to see the famous Russian witch, and tipped her maid munificently. As soon as he was gone, Louise appeared, blushing and apologizing: “Perhaps madame will not be offended,” she stammered, “but I do not need money; enfin—madame consentira . . . ” and she tried to transfer the douceur to her mistress. Louise’s entry cut short the story, and H. P. B. turned with a quizzically humorous smile to another theme: “Of course you have read the S. P. R. Report?—The Spookical Research Society—and know that I am a Russian spy, and the champion impostor of the age?” 394  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS “Yes, I read the Report. But I knew i ts contents already. I was at the meeting when it was first read, two years ago.” “Well,” said H. P. B., again smiling with infinite humour, “and what impression did the frisky lambkin from Australia make upon your susceptible heart?” “A very deep one. I decided that he must be a very good young man, who always came home to tea; and that the Lord had given him a very good conceit of himself. If he got an opinion into his head, he would plow away blandly, and contrary facts would be quite invisible. But your case was not the first on the list. They had a paper on modern witchcraft, at which another of your accusers proved that pinches and burns could be sent by thought-transference to a person miles away. It was quite gruesome, and suggested ducking-stools. Then you came on. But as far as I could see, the young Colonial had never really investigated any occult phenomena at all; he simply investigated dim and confused memories about them in the minds of indifferent witnesses. And all that Mr. Sinnett says in the Occult World seems to me absolutely unshaken by the whole Report. The Poet, the third of your accusers, came down among us after the meeting, and smilingly asked me"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"what I thought of it. I answered that it was the most unfair and one-sided thing I had ever heard of, and that if I had not already been a member of your Society, I should have joined on the strength of that attack. He smiled a kind of sickly smile, and passed on.” “I am glad you think so, my dear,” she answered in her courtly way, “for now I can offer you some tea with a good conscience.” Louise had laid a white cloth on the corner table, brought in a tray, and lit a lamp. The secretary soon joined us, receiving a tart little sermon on being unpunctual, which he was not. Then we came back to her friends, the Psychical Researchers. “They will never do much,” said H. P. B. “They go too much on material lines, and they are far too timid. That was the secret motive that turned them against me. The young Colonial went astray, and then the HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY  395 bell-wethers of the flock foll o wed in his wake, because they were afraid of raising a storm if` they said our phenomena were true. Fancy what it would have meant! Why it would practically have committed Modern Science to our Mahatmas and all I have taught about the inhabitants of the occult world and their tremendous powers. They shrank at the thought of it, and so they made a scapegoat of this poor orphan and exile.” And her eyes were full of humorous pity for herself. “It must have been something like that,” I answered, “for there is simply no backbone in the Report itself. It is the weakest thing of the kind I have ever read. There is not a shred of real evidence in it from beginning to end.” “Do you really think so? That’s right!” cried H. P. B.; and then she turned on her secretary, and poured in a broadside of censure, telling him he was greedy, idle, untidy, unmethodical, and generally worthless. When he ventured an uneasy defence, she flared up and declared that he \"was born a flapdoodle, lived a flapdoodle, and would die a flapdoodle.” He lost his grip, and not unnaturally made a yellow streak of egg across her white tablecloth. “There!” cried H. P. B., glaring at him with withering scorn, and then turning to me for sympathy in her afflictions. That was her way, to rate her disciples in the presence of perfect strangers. It speaks volumes for her, that they loved her still. I tried to draw a red herring across the track,—not that there were any on the table. We were limited to tea, toast and eggs. “The funny thing about the Psychical Researchers,” I said, “is that they have proved for themselves that most of these magical powers are just what you say they are, and they seem to have bodily adopted, not to say, stolen, your teaching of` the Astral Light. Take the thing that has been most made fun of: the journeys of adepts and their pupils in the astral body; you know how severe they are about poor Damodar and his journeys in his astral body from one part of India to another, and even from"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":" 396  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS India over to London. Well, they t h emselves have perfectly sound evidence of the very same thing. I know one of their Committee, a professor of physics, who really discovered thought-transference and made all the first experiments in it. He showed me a number of their unpublished papers, and among them was an account of just such astral journeys made quite consciously. I think the astral traveller was a young doctor, but that is a detail. The point is, that he kept a diary of his visits, and a note of them was also kept by the person he visited, and the two perfectly coincide. They have the whole thing authenticated and in print, and yet when you make the very same claim, they call you a fraud. I wonder why?” “Partly British prejudice,” she answered; “no Englishman ever believes any good of a Russian. They think we are all liars. You know they shadowed me for months in India, as a Russian spy? I don’t understand,” she went on meditatively, yet with a severe eye on her secretary, “I don’t understand how these Englishmen can be so very sure of their superiority, and at the same time in such terror of our invading India.” “We could easily hold our own if you did, H. P. B.,” ventured the patriotic secretary, pulling himself together, but evidently shaky yet, and avoiding her eye. She was down on him in an instant: “Why!” she cried, “what could you do with your poor little army? I tell you, my dear, when the Russians do meet the English on the Afghan frontier, we shall crush you like fleas!” I never saw anything so overwhelming. She rose up in her wrath like the whole Russian army of five millions on a war footing and descended on the poor Briton’s devoted head, with terrific weight. When she was roused, H. P. B. was like a torrent; she simply dominated everyone who came near her; and her immense personal force made itself felt always, even when she was sick and suffering, and with every reason to be cast down. I have never seen anything like her tremendous individual power. She was the justification of her own teaching of the HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY  397 divinity of the will. “But H. P. B.”— h esitated the secretary. But she crushed him with a glance, and he desperately helped himself to more buttered toast only to be accused of gluttony. Again I attempted a diversion: “There is one thing about the S. P. R. Report I want you to explain. What about the writing in the occult letters?” “Well, what about it?” asked H. P. B., immediately interested. “They say that you wrote them yourself, and that they bear evident marks of your handwriting and style. What do you say to that?”"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"“Let me explain it this way,” she answered, after a long gaze at the end of her cigarette. “Have you ever made experiments in thought-transference? If you have, you must have noticed that the person who receives the mental picture very often colours it, or even changes it slightly, with his own thought, and this where perfectly genuine transference of thought takes place. Well, it is something like that with the precipitated letters. One of our Masters, who perhaps does not know English, and of course has no English handwriting, wishes to precipitate a letter in answer to a question sent mentally to him. Let us say he is in Tibet, while I am in Madras or London. He has the answering thought in his mind, but not in English words. He has first to impress that thought on my brain, or on the brain of someone else who knows English, and then to take the word-forms that rise up in that other brain to answer the thought. Then he must form a clear mind-picture of the words in writing, also drawing on my brain, or the brain of whoever it is, for the shapes. Then either through me or some Chela with whom he is magnetically connected, he has to precipitate these word-shapes on paper, first sending the shapes into the Chela’s mind, and then driving them into the paper, using the magnetic force of the Chela to do the printing, and collecting the material, black or blue or red, as the case may be, from the astral light. As all things dissolve into the astral light, the will of the magician can draw them forth again. So he can draw forth colours of 398  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS pigments to mark the figure in t h e letter, using the magnetic force of the Chela to stamp them in, and guiding the whole by his own much greater magnetic force, a current of powerful will.” “That sounds quite reasonable,” I answered. “Won’t you show me how it is done?” “You would have to be clairvoyant,” she answered, in a perfectly direct and matter-of-fact way, “in order to see and guide the currents. But this is the point: Suppose the letter precipitated through me; it would naturally show some traces of my expressions, and even of my writing; but all the same, it would be a perfectly genuine occult phenomenon, and a real message from that Mahatma. Besides, when all is said and done, they exaggerate the likeness of the writings. And experts are not infallible. We have had experts who were just as positive that I could not possibly have written those letters, and just as good experts, too. But the Report says nothing about them. And then there are letters, in just the same handwriting, precipitated when I was thousands of miles away. Dr. Hartmann received more than one at Adyar, Madras, when I was in London; I could hardly have written that.\" “They would simply say Dr. Hartmann was the fraud, in that case.” “Certainly,” cried H. P. B., growing angry now; “we are all frauds and liars, and the lambkin from Australia is the only true man. My dear, it is too much. It is insolent!” And then she laughed at her own warmth, a broad, good-natured Homeric laugh, as hers always was, and finally said: “But you have seen some of the occult letters? What do you say?”"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"“Yes,” I replied; “Mr. Sinnett showed me about a ream of them; the whole series that the Occult World and Esoteric Buddhism are based on. Some of them are in red, either ink or pencil, but far more are in blue. I thought it was pencil at first, and I tried to smudge it with my thumb; but it would not smudge.” HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY  399 “Of course not!” she smiled; “t h e colour is driven into the surface of the paper. But what about the writings?” “I am coming to that. There were two: the blue writing, and the red; they were totally different from each other, and both were quite unlike yours. I have spent a good deal of time studying the relation of handwriting to character, and the two characters were quite clearly marked. The blue was evidently a man of very gentle and even character, but of tremendously strong will; logical, easy-going, and taking endless pains to make his meaning clear. It was altogether the handwriting of a cultivated and very sympathetic man.” “Which I am not,” said H. P. B., with a smile; “that is Mahatma Koothoomi; he is a Kashmiri Brahman by birth, you know, and has travelled a good deal in Europe. He is the author of the Occult World letters, and gave Mr. Sinnett most of the material of Esoteric Buddhism. But you have read all about it.” “Yes, I remember he says you shriek across space with a voice like Sarasvati’s peacock. Hardly the sort of thing you would say of yourself.” “Of course not,” she said; “I know I am a nightingale. But what about the other writing?” “The red? Oh that is wholly different. It is fierce, impetuous, dominant, strong; it comes in volcanic outbursts, while the other is like Niagara Falls. One is fire, and the other is the ocean. They are wholly different, and both quite unlike yours. But the second has more resemblance to yours than the first.” “This is my Master,” she said, “whom we call Mahatma Morya. I have his picture here.” And she showed me a small panel in oils. If ever I saw genuine awe and reverence in a human face, it was in hers, when she spoke of her Master. He was a Rajput by birth, she said, one of the old warrior race of the Indian desert, the finest and handsomest nation in the world. Her Master was a giant, six feet eight, and splendidly built; a superb type of manly beauty. Even in the picture, there is a marvellous power and fascination; 400  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS the force, the fierceness even, of the face; the dark, glowing eyes, which stare you out of countenance; the clear-cut features of bronze, the raven hair and beard—all spoke of a"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"tremendous individuality, a very Zeus in the prime of manhood and strength. I asked her something about his age. She answered: “My dear, I cannot tell you exactly, for I do not know. But this I will tell you. I met him first when I was twenty,—in 1851. He was in the very prime of manhood then. I am an old woman now, but he has not aged a day. He is still in the prime of manhood. That is all I can say. You may draw your own conclusions.” “Have the Mahatmas discovered the elixir of life?” “That is no fable,” said H. P. B. seriously. “It is only the veil hiding a real occult process, warding off age and dissolution for periods which would seem fabulous” so I will not mention them. The secret is this: for every man, there is a climacteric, when he must draw near to death; if he has squandered his life-powers, there is no escape for him; but if he has lived according to the law, he may pass through and so continue in the same body almost indefinitely.” Then she told me something about other Masters and adepts she had known,—for she made a difference, as though the adepts were the captains of the occult world, and the Masters were the generals. She had known adepts of many races, from Northern and Southern India, Tibet, Persia, China, Egypt; of various European nations, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, English; of certain races in South America, where she said there was a Lodge of adepts. “It is the tradition of this which the Spanish Conquistadores found,” she said, “the golden city of Manoah or El Dorado. The race is allied to the ancient Egyptians, and the adepts have still preserved the secret of their dwelling-place inviolable. There are certain members of the Lodges who pass from centre to centre, keeping the lines of connection between them unbroken. But they are always connected in other ways.” “In their astral bodies?” HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY  401 “Yes,” she answered, “and in othe r ways still higher. They have a common life and power. As they rise in spirituality, they rise above difference of race, to our common humanity. The series is unbroken.” “Adepts are a necessity in nature and in supernature. They are the links between men and the gods; these ’gods’ being the souls of great adepts and Masters of bygone races and ages, and so on, up to the threshold of Nirvana. The continuity is unbroken.” “What do they do?” “You would hardly understand, unless you were an adept. But they keep alive the spiritual life of mankind.” “What does it feel like, to go sailing about in your astral body? I sometimes dream I am flying, and I am always in the same position; almost lying on my back, and going feet foremost. Is it anything like that?” “That is not what I feel,” she said; “I feel exactly like a cork rising to the top of water, you understand. The relief is immense. I am only alive then. And then I go to the Master.”"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"“Come back to what you were saying. I ought not to have interrupted you. How do the adepts guide the souls of men? “In many ways, but chiefly by teaching their souls direct, in the spiritual world. But that is difficult for you to understand. This is quite intelligible, though. At certain regular periods, they try to give the world at large a right understanding of spiritual things. One of their number comes forth to teach the masses, and is handed down to tradition as the Founder of a religion. Krishna was such a Master; so was Zoroaster; so were Buddha and Shankara Acharya, the great sage of Southern India. So also was the Nazarene. He went forth against the counsel of the rest, to give to the masses before the time, moved by a great pity, and enthusiasm for humanity; he was warned that the time was unfavorable, but nevertheless he elected to go, and so was put to death at the instigation of the priests.” “Have the adepts any secret records of his life?” 402  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS “ Th e y m u s t h a v e ,” s h e a n s w e r e d ; “ f or they have records of the lives of all Initiates. Once I was in a great cave-temple in the Himalaya mountains, with my Master,” and she looked at the picture of the splendid Rajput; “there were many statues of adepts there; pointing to one of them, he said: ‘This is he whom you call Jesus. We count him to be one of the greatest among us.’ “But that is not the only work of the adepts. At much shorter periods, they send forth a messenger to try to teach the world. Such a period comes in the last quarter of each century, and the Theosophical Society represents their work for this epoch.” “How does it benefit mankind?” “How does it benefit you to know the laws of life? Does it not help you to escape sickness and death? Well, there is a soul-sickness, and a soul-death. Only the true teaching of Life can cure them. The dogmatic churches, with their hell and damnation, their metal heaven and their fire and brimstone, have made it almost impossible for thinking people to believe in the immortality of the soul. And if they do not believe in a life after death, then they have no life after death. That is the law.” “How can what people believe possibly affect them? Either it is or it isn’t, whatever they may believe.” “Their belief affects them in this way. Their life after death is made by their aspirations and spiritual development unfolding in the spiritual world. According to the growth of each, so is his life after death. It is the complement of his life here. All unsatisfied spiritual longings, all desires for higher life, all aspirations and dreams of noble things, come to flower in the spiritual life, and the soul has its day, for life on earth is its night. But if you have no aspirations, no higher longings, no beliefs in any life after death, then there is nothing for your spiritual life to be made up of; your soul is a blank.” “What becomes of you then?” “You reincarnate immediately, almost without an interval, and without regaining consciousness in the other world.”"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":" HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY  403 “Suppose, on the other hand, you do believe in heaven, say the orthodox El Dorado?” “Your fate after death is this. You have first to pass through what we call Kama Loka, the world of desire, the borderland, in which the soul is purged of the dross of animal life; of all its passions and evil desires. These gradually work themselves out, and having no fresh fuel to keep them burning, they slowly exhaust themselves. Then the soul rises to what we call Devachan, the state which is distorted in the orthodox teaching of heaven. Each soul makes its own Devachan, and sees around it those whom it most loved on earth, enjoying happiness in their company. If you believed in the orthodox heaven, you see the golden city and the gates of pearl; if you believed in Shiva’s paradise, you find yourself in the midst of many-armed gods; the Red-man sees the happy hunting grounds, and the philosopher enters into the free life of the soul. In all cases, your spirit gathers new strength for a fresh incarnation.” “Must you come back? Is there no escape?” “If your material desires are unexhausted at death, you must. Desires are forces, and we believe in the conservation of force. You must reap the seed of your own sowing, and reap it where it was sown. Your new life will be the exact result of your deeds in your preceding life. No one can escape the punishment of his sins, any more than he can escape the reward of his virtues. That is the law of Karma. You must go on being reborn till you reach Nirvana.” “Well, it seems to me that all that is more or less contained in the orthodox beliefs, only a good deal distorted.” “Yes,” she answered; “that is just it. The orthodoxies do contain the truth, but their followers do not understand it; they put forth teachings which no intelligent man can accept, and so we are all drifting into atheism and materialism. But when we Theosophists show them how to interpret their teachings, it will be quite different. Then they will see how much truth they had, without knowing it. The stories in Genesis, for instance, are all 404  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS symbols of real truths; and the a ccount of the Creation there, and of Adam and Eve, has far more real truth than Darwinism, once you understand it. But that can only be done by Theosophy.” “How would you, as a Theosophist, set about it?” “Well,” she answered, “in two ways: first, by giving out the truth, as it is taught today in the occult schools, and then by the comparative method; by setting people to study the Aryan and other Eastern scriptures, where they will find the other halves of so many things that have proved stumbling-blocks in the Bible.”"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"“For instance?” “Take that very teaching of heaven and hell and purgatory. The sacred books of India light up the whole of it, and make it a thoroughly philosophic and credible teaching. But you must study the Oriental religions before you can fully understand what I say. Remember that in the Old Testament there is absolutely no teaching of the immortality of the soul, while in the New Testament it is inextricably confused with the resurrection of the body. But the Upanishads have the real occult and spiritual doctrine.” “Well, I can thoroughly understand and sympathize with that; and to put forth any such teaching at a time like this, when we are all drifting into materialism, would seem a big enough work for any school of adepts and Masters. I can see how the teaching of rebirth would make life far more unselfish and humane, and therefore far happier. What else do you teach, as Theosophists?” “Well, Sir! I am being cross-examined this evening, it would seem,” she answered with a smile, and rolled me another cigarette, making herself one also, and lighting up with evident relish. “We teach something very old, and yet which needs to be taught. We teach universal brotherhood.” “Don’t let us get vague and general. Tell me exactly what you mean by that.” “Let me take a concrete case,” she said; and glanced meditatively at her secretary, who had been listening quietly and with serious and sincere interest to all she HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY  405 had been saving, even though he h a d heard much of it from her, time and again. He began to grow a little uneasy under her gaze, and she noticed it and instantly fastened upon him. “Take the English,” she said, and looked at him with those potent blue eyes of hers, as though he in his own person must answer for the sins of his race. “H. P. B.,” he said, rising with a sigh from the table; “I think I had really better go upstairs and go on copying out the manuscript of The Secret Doctrine ” ; and he disappeared. “Do you think he will?” said H. P. B. with a smile of infinite good-humour. “Not he; he will cuddle into his arm-chair, smoke endless cigarettes, and read a blood and thunder novel.” She was mistaken, however. When I went upstairs to say good-bye, he was in the arm-chair, serenely smoking, it is true; but it was a detective story. He sat upon it, and said something about getting to work. “Take the English,” she repeated. “How cruel they are! How badly they treat my poor Hindus!” “I have always understood that they had done a good deal for India in a material way,” I objected. “India is a well-ventilated jail,” she said; “it is true they do something in a material way, but it is always three for themselves and one for the natives. But what is the use of material benefits, if you are despised and trampled down morally all the time? If your ideals of national honour and glory are crushed in the mud, and you are made to feel all the time that you are an inferior race—a lower order of mortals—pigs, the English call them,"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"and sincerely believe it. Well, just the reverse of that would be universal brotherhood. Do them less good materially—not that they do so very much, besides collecting the taxes regularly—and respect their feelings a little more. The English believe that the ’inferior races’ exist only to serve the ends of the English; but we believe that they exist for themselves, and have a perfect right to be happy in their own way. No amount of material benefit can compensate for hurting their souls and crushing out their ideals. Besides there is another side of all 406  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS that, which we as Theosophists al w ays point out. There are really no ’inferior races,’ for all are one in our common humanity; and as we have all had incarnations in each of these races, we ought to be more brotherly to them. They are our wards, entrusted to us; and what do we do? We invade their lands, and shoot them down in sight of their own homes; we outrage their women, and rob their goods, and then with smooth-faced hypocrisy we turn round and say we are doing it for their good. There are two bad things: hypocrisy and cruelty; but I think if I had to choose, I would prefer cruelty. But there is a just law,” she went on; and her face was as stern as Nemesis; “the false tongue dooms its lie; the spoiler robs to render. ’Ye shall not come forth, until ye have paid the uttermost farthing’.” “So that is what the adepts sent you forth to teach?” “Yes,” she answered; “that and other things;—things which are very important, and will soon be far more important. There is the danger of black magic, into which all the world, and especially America, is rushing as fast as it can go. Only a wide knowledge of the real psychic and spiritual nature of man can save humanity from grave dangers.” “Witch-stories in this so-called nineteenth century, in this enlightened age?” “Yes, Sir! Witch-stories, and in this enlightened age! What do you call it but a witch-story, that very experiment you told me of, made by my friend the Spookical Researcher? Is it not witchcraft, to transfer pinches and burns, pain and suffering, in fact, though only slight in this case, to another person at a distance? Suppose it was not as an experiment, but in dead earnest, and with dire malice and evil intent? What then? Would the victim not feel it? Could he protect himself? And would not that be witchcraft in just the sense that sent people to the stake and faggot all through the Middle Ages? Have you read the famous witchcraft trial at Salem? Yes, Sir! Witchcraft in this very enlightened age,—the darkest, most material, and unspiritual that the world has ever seen.” HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY  407 “Oh, but sending pinches by thou g ht-transference can do no great harm?” “You think not? Well, you don’t know what you are talking about. That is the privilege"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"of the young! Once the door is open for that sort of thing, where do you think it is going to be shut? It is the old tale; give the devil an inch, and he will take an ell; give him your finger, and he will presently take your whole arm. Yes, and your body, too! Do you not see the tremendous evils that lie concealed in hypnotism? Look at Charcot’s experiments at the Salpêtrière! He has shown that a quite innocent person can be made to perform actions quite against his or her will; can be made to commit crimes, even, by what he calls Suggestion. And the somnambule will forget all about it, while the victim can never identify the real criminal. Charcot is a benevolent man, and will never use his power to do harm. But all men are not benevolent. The world is full of cruel, greedy, and lustful people, who will be eager to seize a new weapon for their ends, and who will defy detection and pass through the midst of us all unpunished. “Yes, Sir! Witch-tales in this enlightened age! And mark my words! You will have such witch-tales as the Middle Ages never dreamt of. Whole nations will drift insensibly into black magic, with good intentions, no doubt, but paving the road to hell none the less for that! Hypnotism and suggestion are great and dangerous powers, for the very reason that the victim never knows when he is being subjected to them; his will is stolen from him, and mark my words: these things may be begun with good motives, and for right purposes. But I am an old woman, and have seen much of human life in many countries. And I wish with all my heart I could believe that these powers would be used only for good! Whoever lets himself or herself be hypnotized, by anyone, good or bad, is opening a door which he will be powerless to shut; and he cannot tell who will be the next to enter! If you could foresee what I foresee, you would begin heart and soul to spread the teaching of universal brotherhood. It is the only safeguard!” 408  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS “How is it going to guard people a gainst hypnotism?” “By purifying the hearts of people who would misuse it. And universal brotherhood rests upon the common soul. It is because there is one soul common to all men, that brotherhood, or even common understanding is possible. Bring men to rest on that, and they will be safe. There is a divine power in every man which is to rule his life, and which no one can influence for evil, not even the greatest magician. Let men bring their lives under its guidance, and they have nothing to fear from man or devil. And now, my dear, it is getting late, and I am getting sleepy. So I must bid you goodnight!” And the Old Lady dismissed me with that grand air of hers which never left her, because it was a part of herself. She was the most perfect aristocrat I have ever known. It was long after that, before we came back to the question of magical powers. In August, 1888, H. P. B. had a visit from her old chum, Colonel H. S. Olcott. He was writing, at a side table. H. P. B. was playing Patience, as she did nearly every evening, and I was sitting opposite her, watching, and now and then talking about the East, whence Colonel Olcott had just come. Then H. P. B. got tired of her card game, which would not come out, and tapped her fingers slowly on the table, half unconsciously. Then her eyes"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"came to focus, and drawing her hand back a foot or so from the table, she continued the tapping movement in the air. The taps, however, were still perfectly audible—on the table a foot from her hand. I watched, with decided interest. Presently she had a new idea, and turning in my direction, began to send her astral taps against the back of my hand. I could both feel and hear them. It was something like taking sparks from the prime conductor of an electric machine; or, better still, perhaps, it was like spurting quicksilver through your fingers. That was the sensation. The noise was a little explosive burst. Then she changed her direction again and began to bring her taps to bear on the top of my head. They were quite audible, and, needless to say, I felt them quite distinctly. HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY  409 I was at the opposite side of the t able, some five or six feet away, all through this little experiment in the unexplained laws of nature, and the psychical powers latent in man. No experiment could have been more final and convincing; its very simplicity made it stand out as a new revelation. Here was a quite undoubted miracle, as miracles are generally understood, yet a miracle which came off. But at our first meeting, Mme. Blavatsky did not even approach the subject; none the less, she conveyed the sense of the miraculous. It is hard to say exactly how, but the fact remains. There was something in her personality, her bearing, the light and power of her eyes, which spoke of a wider and deeper life, not needing lesser miracles to testify to it, because in itself miraculous. That was the greatest thing about her, and it was always there; this sense of a bigger world, of deeper powers, of unseen might; to those in harmony with her potent genius, this came as a revelation and incentive to follow the path she pointed out. To those who could not see with her eyes, who could not raise themselves in some measure to her vision, this quality came as a challenge, an irritant, a discordant and subversive force, leading them at last to an attitude of fierce hostility and denunciation. When the last word is said, she was greater than any of her works, more full of living power than even her marvellous writings. It was the intimate and direct sense of her genius, the strong ray and vibration of that genius itself, which worked her greatest achievements and won her greatest triumphs. Most perfect work of all, her will carried with it a sense and conviction of immortality. Her mere presence testified to the vigour of the soul. [The “meeting” which Charles Johnston mentions on page 394 was one held by the S.P.R. in London, on June 24 1885, a t which Richard Hodgson read part of his Report. Johnston, in his Address at the Convention of the T.S. in America, April, 1907 (see the Theosophical Quarterly, New York, Vol. V, July, 1907), calls it a “fearful meeting.”— Compiler. ] END OF VOLUME VIII "},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME VIII CHRONOLOGICAL SURVEY O F THE C HIEF E VENTS IN THE L IFE OF H.
