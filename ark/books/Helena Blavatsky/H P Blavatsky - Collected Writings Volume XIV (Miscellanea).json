Its final production is due to the patient labor of several persistent fellow-students, since a number of quotations had to be completed, or foot-noted, after the passing of the Editor, Mr. Boris de Zirkoff. Nicholas Weeks gave valuable assistance in every phase of the work, including proofreading and indexing. Jeanne Sims, of Los Angeles, was always ready to proofread and be consulted in various ways. We thank Mr. David Reigle especially for his knowledge of Sanskrit and Tibetan terms, as well as the resources of his Eastern School Reference Library. We owe a great debt to Mr. Richard I. Robb who contributed the major portion of the Bio-Bibliography, and completed the unfinished entries of Mr. de Zirkoff. Mr. John Drais redrew and corrected some of the Hebrew letters. Aside from these associates we welcomed the sustained interest & proofreading of Mr. & Mrs. Hector Tate; the research of Mr. Hannah Fadel, Vern Haddick and of Karen Skubish of the Newberry Library. Anne Redlich helped located several obscure dates for our Index. From abroad, Ted Davy, Gen. Sec. of the T.S., Canada, Mr. & Mrs. Wilfried Goltz (who traced the Von Haller poem) and several T.S.

Boris de Zirkoff In the Fall of 1897, a little over six years after the passing of H. P. Blavatsky, there was published by The Theosophical Publishing Society in London a large volume entitled The Secret Doctrine , Vol. III, with the sub-title: Occultism . * The original edition of this work is at present hard to find, though it turns up every now and then in second-hand bookstores. But the text of it has been incorporated as a separate volume in later impressions of the revised edition of The Secret Doctrine (Vols. I and II), published in 1893, and can now be read in the edition of the S.D ., published since 1938 by The Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar, Madras, India.† It forms Book V of this edition which is divided into six handy books. There exist in the minds of many students, both within and outside of the Theosophical Organizations, a variety of misconceptions concerning the nature and contents of the Volume, which, as so many other misunderstandings, are very likely due to lack of adequate information, as well as lack of real interest to determine for themselves the known facts concerning this subject.

Although not published until 1897, the preparation of this Volume had been going on for some years previous to this date, as appears, for instance, from a statement in the January, 1894, issue of Lucifer (Vol. XIII, p. 354), to the effect that “...the third volume of The Secret Doctrine is being typewritten from the MS.” The first pages of this Volume went to the printer around June, 1895,* and the Volume seems to have been completed in September, 1896, although its actual publication had to wait until the American edition, “necessitated by the unfair copyright law,” could be made ready also.† A careful analysis of the contents of this Volume discloses a number of interesting facts. Pages 433-594 consist of: a) The text of the Esoteric Instructions issued privately by H. P. B. herself to the pledged disciples of the Esoteric School. This text is incomplete, however, and considerably edited.‡ b) The text of the Notes taken by various students at the meetings of H.P.B.’s Inner Group. These Notes are heavily edited, and very considerably altered, as comparison with the most complete version of the same Notes , that of Mrs. Alice Leighton Cleather, would easily show.

Besides, as appears quite plainly from G. R. S. Mead’s own explanation, their text was added to this volume as mere padding, to increase its size.† We will now dismiss this particular portion of the volume under discussion, as being of no immediate value for our analysis. –––––––––––––––––––– When H. P. B. lived at Würzburg, Germany, and was working on The Secret Doctrine , she sent a certain batch of MSS. to Adyar, with the intention of having T. Subba Row go over them and make suggestions and emendations, with regard to the text. Being then in a peculiar frame of mind, he disliked what H. P. B. had written, and refused point blank to have anything to do with the MSS. This MS. was in the handwriting of Countess Wachtmeister, and must have been copied from H. P. B.’s own MS. It is now in the Archives of the T.S. at Adyar. The final product of Vol. I of the S.D . shows a great many changes as compared with this earlier MS. H. P. B. must have done a good deal of additional work on it, after Subba Row’s refusal to collaborate with her. But whatever changes and alterations H. P. B. herself may have made at a later period, at least portions of the original MS. must have remained among her papers; these portions of the original MS. of the First Draft of Vol. I of the S.D . can be found in the “Volume III” we are now considering. They account for 68 pages of the work, the text being identical to the corresponding passages of the First Draft. In other words, not all of the First Draft appears in “Volume III,” but a very considerable part of it does. This material covers [in 1897 ed.] pages: 3-43; 47; 61-63; 67-75; 93-97; 98-104; 105-108; 129-137; 211-13; 270-75; 277-79; 315-24; 332-35.

The most natural answer to this is that only these portions of the First Draft were found among H.P.B.’S papers in London, and the existence of the complete First Draft in the Adyar Archives was unknown at the time to Annie Besant, and most likely to other officials at Adyar. This is amply shown by the fact that it was not until March, 1922, some twenty-five years later, that Annie Besant reported in the pages of The Theosophist (Vol. XLIII, pp. 533-34) the discovery of this draft- manuscript by saying that: “ . . . . Another interesting ‘find’ is the first manuscript of the first volume of The Secret Doctrine . . . This evidently is the manuscript which H. P. B. sent from Ostende in 1886 to T. Subba Row . . . . .” She then goes on to state that certain sections in the First Draft and certain Appendices are included in Volume III of 1897. It seems almost incredible that Colonel Olcott, who knew all about the First Draft when it arrived at Adyar in 1886, would have had nothing to say about Volume III, as published in 1897, and that nobody would have brought up for discussion the contents of Volume III, as far as these particular Sections are concerned. As a matter of fact, C. Jinarâjadâsa started publishing the First Draft, from the Adyar Archives, in the pages of The Theosophist ,* with the declared intention of issuing it later in book-form. However, the series was discontinued after a while, the given reason for so doing being the “chaotic” nature of the manuscript, in the use of capitals, dashes and quotation marks, and the difficulties encountered in deciphering Hebrew and Greek scripts, which the amanuensis who copied H. P. B. ‘s original manuscript probably did not know. But even then no –––––––––– * Vol. LII , Aug., 1931; Vol. LIV , Oct., Nov., Dec., 1932; Jan., Feb., March, Apr., May, June, July, Aug., Sept., 1933; Vol. LV , Oct. and Nov. 1933. –––––––––– I NTRODUCTION   xxix mention was made of the presence of part of this material in the published Volume III. Moreover, Sections II and III of “Volume III, “ which, as already stated, are an integral portion of the First Draft of the S.D ., had already been published in Lucifer , Vol. X, June, 1892, pp. 273-83, as an essay entitled: “The Denials and the Mistakes of the Nineteenth Century.”* It is indeed a curious fact how the editors of “Volume III” did not remember that this material had already appeared in print in their own official magazine, and that this"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"was done more than a year after H. P. B.’s passing, at a time when“Volume III” was already being considered and perhaps even started. Moreover, conclusive evidence shows that Sections XXVI and XXVII had been written by H.P.B. in 1885, as part of the First Draft. They were not incorporated into it, however, and were earmarked for The Theosophist , but somehow or other were not published in it either.† We have been considering thus far pages 1-432 of this volume. Of these, 102 pages have now been identified; they form about one-quarter of the total amount. What of the remaining three-quarters then? The first thing that presents itself for consideration is a rather large portion of Volume III, covering pages 376-432, and consisting of Sections XLIII-LI, a total of 56 pages, or about 1/8th of the amount. The material in these Sections hangs together better than anything else within this Volume, and it is evident that a unitary thread runs through it. The title given to Section XLIII, “The Mystery of the Buddha,” could have been chosen equally well as a title for this entire portion of the Volume, as this is the main subject of which it treats. –––––––––– * [Now in B.C.W ., Vol. XIII, pp. 224-41.] † [However, these may now be found as two articles in B.C. W ., Vol. VII, pp. 105-34 and pp. 230-40.] –––––––––– xxx  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS There is excellent evidence available of the fact that either this entire material, or at least a portion of it, had been written prior to 1888, as H. P. B. speaks in The Secret Doctrine (Vol. I, p.52, footnote; and top of page 118) of a section or chapter entitled “A Mystery About Buddha,” and “The Mystery About Buddha,” and refers the student thereto: she points out, however, that this is to be found in “a subsequent volume.” The highly metaphysical nature of the teachings contained in these sections, and the fact that some of them outline certain aspects of the Occult Tradition not even touched upon by H. P. B. in any other of her writings including the two original volumes of The Secret Doctrine would logically make the student feel that here indeed is a portion of the text originally intended for a Third Volume of this work. We find a seeming confirmation of this in the Preface to Volume III, as published in 1897, signed by Annie Besant, wherein she says: “the papers given to me [Annie Besant]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"by H. P. B. were quite unarranged, and had no obvious order: I have therefore taken each paper as a separate Section, and have arranged them as sequentially as possible;”* She then goes on to say, in regard to “The Mystery of Buddha” Sections, that these “were given into –––––––––– * In blunt contradiction of this statement, we are told by Mrs. Besant in 1922 ( The Theosophist for March) that in revising The Secret Doctrine for the 1893 edition, “the trustees...made only such changes as she [H. P. B.] had herself directed, which consist mainly in the correction of verbal and grammatical errors, and the arrangement of the material of Vol. III.” If H. P. B. herself left directions how Volume III, as published in 1897, should be arranged, what becomes of their allegedly “chaotic” condition? –––––––––– I NTRODUCTION   xxxi my [Annie Besant’s] hands to publish, as part of the Third Volume of The Secret Doctrine . . .” This, we must remember was written in 1897.* In the light of this statement, it is therefore rather curious to find that when, in 1893, the revised edition of The Secret Doctrine appeared in print, every one of H. P. B.’s direct references to Volume III and IV had been eliminated by the Editor; they are not to be found in any of the subsequent impressions of this edition.† If these references were eliminated because, in the view of the editor, no such Volumes ever existed, how is it that anything could have been handed over to Mrs. Besant by H. P. B. specifically as part of a Third Volume? Our perplexities are further increased by the interesting fact that on October 6, 1926, Mr. William Mulliss, Managing Editor of the Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada), a competent reporter and for ten years an earnest student of The Secret Doctrine , interviewed Annie Besant in Los Angeles, California, on behalf of several newspapers. His inquiries related in part to the question of a Third Volume presumed to have existed at one time or another. We quote from the complete verbatim report of the interview: Mr. Mulliss : Your critics have insisted that somebody or other has deliberately suppressed the Third and Fourth Volumes of The Secret Doctrine to which H. P. B. makes reference in the First Volume of The Secret Doctrine . What have you to say of this ? Do you regard the Third Volume of your edition of The Secret Doctrine entitled ‘Occultism’ as containing any of the matter intended for the Third and the Fourth Volumes?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"–––––––––– * Two years earlier, namely in May, 1895, writing on other subjects, Mrs. Besant had already referred to “the third volume of The Secret Doctrine , which was placed into my [her] hands by H. P.B...” ( Lucifer , Vol. XVI, p. 188). † These references may be found in Vol. I, pp. vii and xxxix-xl of the Introductory, and in Vol. II, pp. 106, 437, 455 and 797- 98. –––––––––– xxxii  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS “ Mrs. Annie Besant : I was appointed H. P. B.’S literary executor, and the matter from which I compiled the Third Volume of ‘Occultism’ in The Secret Doctrine , published under my direction was compiled from a mass of miscellaneous writings found in her desk after her death. These I took under my own charge. “ Mr . Mullis : Did Mead help you in the compilation of these articles? “ Mrs . A. Besant : No. The papers came absolutely under my own hand and Mead had nothing to do with them. “ Mr. Mulliss : Well what about the material for the Third and Fourth Volumes? “ Mrs. A. Besant : I never saw them and do not know what has become of them.” Not only do we run here into a flat contradiction of the statement made in the Preface of the published Volume concerning the nature of “The Mystery of Buddha” Sections, but we are also told that the mass of miscellaneous writings under discussion was found in H. P. B.’s desk after her death, and that Mrs. Besant took these under her own charge, although we had just been made to believe that H. P. B. herself had given these papers to Mrs. Besant. Under these curious contradictions, we ask ourselves: Is there any further clue to this material concerning the Buddha, and its possible origin? We think there is such a clue. In an article entitled “Esoteric Axioms and Spiritual Speculations” ( The Theosophist , Vol. III, No. 4, January, 1882, pp. 92-93), H. P. B. made some pertinent comments upon a review of Arthur Lillie’s book , Buddha and Early Buddhism , written by “M. A. (Oxon),” the pseudonym of The Rev. Stainton Moses, the famous Spiritualist. H. P.

Sumangala Unnanse, Buddhist High Priest of Adam’s Peak, Ceylon . . . . the most learned expounder of Southern Buddhism; and (2) the Chohan-Lama of Rinch-cha-tze (Tibet) the Chief of the Archive registrars of the secret Libraries of the Dalai and Tashi-Lhünpo Lamas-Rimpoche . . . the latter, moreover, is a ‘Panchhen,’ or great teacher, one of the most learned theologians of Northern Buddhism and esoteric Lamaism The Chohan-Lama promised to write a reply in due course of time. For some unknown reason, this reply was not published in The Theosophist at the time. It must have remained for some years among H. P. B.’s manuscripts, unused, and did not appear in print until after her death, namely in the September and October, 1894, issues of Lucifer , under the title of “Tibetan Teachings.” As appears from the editorial note appended at the end of this essay,* “this study of ‘Tibetan Teachings’ is taken from a series of articles originally prepared for The Theosophist , but for some reason or other, set aside, and never published.” The Editors of Lucifer , moreover, express the hope “to be able to continue the series for some months.” So it appears that the Editors had a considerable amount of similar material on their hands, and that they planned to publish it. Could this have been the material now contained in Volume III, and dealing with “The Mystery of the Buddha” and other related subjects? There is at least a fair possibility of just that. –––––––––– * See H. P. Blavatsky, Collected Writings , Vol. VI, pp. 94-112. –––––––––– xxxiv  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS It so happens that Sections XLVII and XLIX of Volume III contain a number of paragraphs which are identical with portions of the text of “Tibetan Teachings.” Would it be too rash to imagine that “The Mystery of Buddha” material in Volume III contains, at least in part, text which stands in close relationship to the “Tibetan Teachings” series, and which it had been at one time decided to run in the pages of Lucifer , as a continuation of the two installments of “Tibetan Teachings”? We cannot definitely assert it, but one thing is certain, namely, that no trace has ever"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"been found of the material which the Lucifer Editors had evidently in mind when promising to their readers further installments of the “Tibetan Teachings” series. We have now to deal with the Introductory and Sections: I; portions of IV and V; VII, VIII, XII-XVI inclusive; XVIII-XXII inclusive; XXIV, XXV; XXVIII; XXXI-XXXIV; XXXVI; XXXVIII-XLII inclusive. These constitute some 238 pages or close to one half of the material. They cover a great variety of subjects; some of them hang together better than others; some are definitely kabbalistic; others are dealing with the origins of Christianity; still others go into subjects treated of in a somewhat different manner in Vols. I and II of The Secret Doctrine. A careful perusal of the words of Bertram Keightley, who had such an immediate and prolonged contact with the original MSS. of H. P. B.’s great work, throws much light upon the nature and origin of these sections. He says: “. . . . Our next step––Arch’s [Archibald Keightley’s] and mine-was to get the whole of the MS., every line of it, typed out on ordinary quarto typing paper––professionally––for we fully realized that the actual work of re-arrangement and fitting must not be done upon H. P. B.’s own MS., which ought to be preserved intact for reference, but upon a copy. Hence we had it all typed out . . . . . . “When we had got all the MS. typed out, we tied up the I NTRODUCTION   xxxv original MS. complete as it was and made a strong sealed parcel of it all, which was given back to H. P. B., and was subsequently removed to No. 19 Avenue Road, St. John’s Wood, N.W. (Mrs. Besant’s house), when H. P. B. moved there. I clearly remember seeing the parcel there intact shortly before I left for India a few months before H. P. B. ‘s death. “To resume, Arch and I again went very carefully through the now typewritten MS. and devised the plan finally approved and adopted by H. P. B. This was to divide the whole work into two volumes: Vol. I. Cosmogenesis and Vol. II. Anthropogenesis. Each volume as to be based upon a set of the Stanzas of Dzyan and each was to consist of three parts; first, the Stanzas with Commentary and explanations; second, Symbolism; and third, Addenda and Appendices. “As soon as the first section of Volume I was roughly put together, we handed it over to H. P. B. with detailed notes of gaps, omissions, queries and points for her to consider. She went to work on the typescript with pen, scissors and paste, till she said she had done all she could. The final result was a regular mosaic pattern of typescript, pasted bits, and matter added and written in by H. P. B. or sometimes transferred from other places in the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"second and third sections. In the end it got such a complicated mosaic, that Arch and I ourselves typed out afresh the whole of the matter in the first section of the two volumes and much also of the second and third sections, thus completing the matter which went to the printers as Volumes I and II of the first edition of the S.D . After this was done, there still remained a certain amount of matter left over; mostly unfinished fragments or ‘Appendices’ or bits about symbolism, which could find no suitable place in the selected matter or––more frequently––were not in a condition or state for publication. Of course we asked H. P. B. about this matter, as it was she herself––not Arch nor myself––who had set it aside for the time being. She put this left-over matter in one of the drawers of her desk and said that ‘some day’ she would make a third Volume out of xxxvi  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS it. But this she never did, and after H. P. B.’s death, Mrs. Besant and Mr. Mead published all that could possibly be printed without complete and extensive revision and rewriting––as part of Volume III in the revised edition. . .”* At an earlier date, prior to H. P. B.’s passing, namely in December, 1890, Bertram Keightley, addressing the Convention at Adyar, on the subject of “Theosophy in the West, “ is reported to have stated that “what would now be the 3rd volume of the history of Occultism was to have been the first volume, while the treatises on Cosmogony and the Genesis of Man were to form a later series . . . .” This statement, in the light of the longer excerpt just quoted, goes a long way in supporting the conclusion that a great deal of the published Volume III is made up of material set aside after the Keightleys had done their work upon the MSS. of the S.D .; further light can be thrown upon this material by considering the actual subjects of which it treats. There is something in connection with the subject-matter of this portion of Volume III which must not be overlooked by anyone who is attempting to identify the origin of this material. The words of Bertram Keightley should be taken together with another fact of considerable importance, namely, that there exist two distinct essays from the pen of H. P. B., both published in Lucifer , and both unfinished. Their continuation is promised, but no further installments ever appeared. They are: “The Esoteric Character of the Gospels,” and “Roots of Ritualism in Church and Masonry.”† A very considerable amount of material on pages 287-374 of Volume III, treating as it does on the origins of Christianity, the Mystery-Schools, occultism and magic in their relation to the symbolism of the day, initiatory rites –––––––––– * “Reminiscences of H.

(See"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"B. C. W ., Vols.

The question suggests itself whether some of this material, if not the whole of it, may not have been intended for the continuation of these articles in Lucifer . This surmise is strengthened by the curious fact that pages 167-68 of Volume III have in them identical passages to the text of “The Esoteric Character of the Gospels” series. The link between the two is thus established. Writing in “On the Watch-Tower,” in Lucifer , Vol. XX, July, 1897, pp. 353-54, after the appearance of Volume III, G. R. S. Mead gives the following apology concerning the matter contained in it. He writes: “It is somewhat a novel experience for the present writer, who has edited, in one form or another, almost all that H. P. B. has written in English, with the exception of Isis Unveiled , to find himself turning over the leaves of Volume III of The Secret Doctrine as one of the general public, for with the exception of pp. 433-594 he has seen no word of it before. But other work has prevented his sharing in the labour of editing the MS., and the burden has fallen on the shoulders of Mrs. Besant. “What, then, is the first impression of one who has minutely studied every turn and twist of H. P. B.’s phraseology and literary methods, and read everything she has written on theosophical subjects? “We cannot disguise the fact that the first feeling is one of disappointment. The spirit of the stanzas and commentaries, which for the theosophist make the two first volumes stand out a head and shoulders beyond all other theosophical literature, is entirely absent. The pages are eagerly scanned for the discovery of a new gold-mine of the nature of stanza or commentary, but with the exception of one or two paragraphs none is to be found. In fact, until we come to p. 359 and ‘The Mystery of Buddha,’ the sections on which fill pp. 359-432, we find but disjecta membra -sections, xxxviii  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS the majority of which were evidently excluded from Volumes I. and II. because of their"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"inferiority to the rest of the work. The editor was bound to publish these, but we entirely share her private opinion, that it would have been better to have printed them as separate articles in Lucifer , than to have included them as part of The Secret Doctrine . One thing is almost certain, that had Mme. Blavatsky lived, these sections in their present form would not have formed part of her great work. They represent her in her least important capacity.” It is important to bear in mind that Mead agrees with Annie Besant on the general evaluation of this material, as told to Mr. Mulliss, that he supports her in saying that he had nothing to do with the preparation of the MSS., and that he had been told by Annie Besant that this material would have been better suited as articles for Lucifer than as part of The Secret Doctrine. In view of his positive statement, which very adroitly shifts the responsibility upon the shoulders of Mrs. Besant, we are at a loss to account for Mrs. Alice Leighton Cleather’s words in connection with Volume III. She says: “It so happens that while it was being set up I was able actually to peruse one or two of the familiar long foolscap sheets which H. P. B. always covered with her small fine handwriting.

From his words, the reader would conclude that Mead has edited almost everything that H. P. B. had ever written in English, with the exception of Isis Unveiled . Mr. Mead probably forgot, when he wrote this sentence, that H. P. B. had been writing in English since 1874, and in so doing had the editorial help of a number of people, from Col. Olcott himself down to the Keightleys. It is the latter who edited the entire MS. of The Secret Doctrine , and not Mr. Mead either. However, Mr. Mead revised the 1893 edition of this work, and is almost wholly responsible for whatever changes and alterations occur in"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"this edition. Unless these various angles are borne in mind, confusion will result, and the picture of events will be blurred. The unsigned reviewer of Volume III in the pages of The Theosophist * seems to agree with Mead’s apology when saying that “. . .the eager student. . .will look in vain. . .for equal evidences of that might sweep of mind which could delve into the mysteries of cosmogony and cosmology with such apparent familiarity . . . .

B. had written than I did, persisted in her view and by herself edited the matter for publication, but even when every scrap that remained had been utilized, it made a very thin volume. I therefore persuaded her to add the so-called Instructions of what is known as the ‘Esoteric Section’ or Eastern School, which had hitherto been secret documents. My argument was that the ‘occult teachings’ as they were deemed by the faithful, were now in the hands of hundreds, scattered all over the world, some of whom were by no means trustworthy, and that it was highly probable that we should some day find them printed publicly by some unscrupulous individual or privately circulated illegitimately. Fortunately, Mrs. Besant agreed, and they were included in Vol. III, save certain matter dealing with sex questions. A load of anxiety was lifted off my mind. I thought that the making of these ‘Instructions’ accessible to the general public might possibly put an end to this unhealthy inner secret school. But this hope, alas, was not to be fulfilled.” We may not share Mead’s views about the “unhealthy inner secret school, “nor endorse"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"an attitude that suggests the carrying out of a morally oblique action because someone else might do so likewise, and “beat you to the punch.” We may not share with Mead his rather sarcastic spirit, nor his slurring remarks concerning the “occult teachings.” But what we will have to acknowledge, on the basis of this excerpt, is that Mead evidently had seen, and most likely read through, the “disjecta membra,” before Mrs. Besant proceeded to edit them: and if so, it is incorrect to say that he, Mead, had nothing to do with this Volume III, and “saw no word of it before” the Volume appeared in print––which is precisely what he said in 1897! Indeed, as the Frenchman would say: Lequel de nous trompe-t-on ici ?

Only portions of this Adyar MS. can be found in Volume III, and they are taken from H. P. B.’s own manuscript in London, and not from the manuscript at Adyar, the existence of which was unknown at the time Volume III was published. It is seen, therefore, that Ransom acknowledges that the MS. at Adyar contains matter published in Volume III, that she agrees with Bertram Keightley about left-over portions of MSS., which would not fit anywhere sequentially, and commits herself about the fact that this material had been written as early as 1886.* In view of the evidence brought forth in the foregoing pages, and on the basis of the actual nature of the material contained in the volume under discussion, it seems unjust and contrary to common sense to have entitled it Volume III of H. P. B.’s monumental work, The Secret Doctrine . Even if the argument is raised to the effect that the Sections on “The Mystery of Buddha” do contain certain teachings not to be found anywhere else in H. P.

This was done for the sake of completion. 4) As indicated above, the scope of this material necessitated that it be divided between several volumes of the Collected Writings .

According to that Preface, the various papers which became part of this volume were originally unarranged and had no obvious order, and Annie Besant arranged them as sequentially as possible. She says she corrected grammatical errors and eliminated obviously non-English idioms, which was an unfortunate and quite unnecessary thing to do, as H. P. B.’s foreign-sounding phrases and peculiarities of expression are sui generis and are rather an asset than a liability. Nothing of that nature has been done throughout the volumes of the Collected Writings wherein H. P. B.’s own language has been followed in every case. Whether any other liberties were taken with H. P. B.’s original text is impossible to say, although Annie Besant specifically states that “in a few cases [she] filled in a gap, but any such addition is enclosed within square brackets, so as to be distinguished from the text.” She says in regard to the Sections under the general title of The Mystery of the Buddha” that she included them with “some hesitation,” because “together with some most suggestive thought, they contain very numerous errors of fact, and many statements based on esoteric writings, not on esoteric knowledge.” This general trend of ideas is repeated several times and enlarged upon. It is curious, to say the least, that anybody from among the then recently acquired followers of H. P. B. would have had the temerity of pointing out the alleged errors of H. P. B.’s statements and of comparing them with an implied , even if not actually expressed, correct knowledge on his or her part of what the true esoteric doctrine was on any subject under consideration. Considering that the Sections entitled “The Mystery of the Buddha” contain some of the most recondite teachings of the Esoteric Philosophy, including certain tenets merely hinted at and which do not occur anywhere else in the entire literary output of H. P. B., not even in The Secret Doctrine , any statement implying greater knowledge concerning these mystical tenets is both ridiculous and unfair.

It may have been written somewhat earlier than the actual year of publication. If the pages of Lucifer are scanned for any such articles as are hinted at in the Preface, nothing from the pen of H.

Knowledge––the first step to which is the power of comprehending the truth, of discerning the real from the false––is for those only who, having freed themselves from every prejudice and conquered their human conceit and selfishness, are ready to accept every and any truth, once it is demonstrated to them. Of such there are very few. The majority judge of a work according to the respective prejudices of its critics, who are guided in their turn by the popularity or unpopularity of the author, rather than by its own faults or merits. Outside the Theosophical circle, therefore, the present volume is certain to receive at the hands of the general public a still colder welcome than its two predecessors have met with.† In our day no statement can hope for a fair trial, or even hearing, unless its arguments run on the line of legitimate and accepted enquiry, remaining strictly within the boundaries of official Science or orthodox Theology. Our age is a paradoxical anomaly. It is pre-eminently materialistic and as pre-eminently pietistic. Our literature, our modern thought and progress, so called, both run on these two parallel lines, so incongruously dissimilar and yet both so popular and so very orthodox, each in its own way. He who presumes to draw a third line, as a hyphen of reconciliation between the two, has to be fully prepared for the worst.

One of the main points in this Volume* is to indicate in the works of the old Aryan, Greek, and other Philosophers of note, as well as in all the world-scriptures, the presence of a strong Esoteric allegory and symbolism.

Sir M. Monier-Williams again holds the same view with regard to Buddhism. To hear him is to regard Gautama, the Buddha, as an enemy of every pretence to Esoteric teachings. He himself never taught them! All such “pretences” to Occult learning and “magic powers” are due to the later Arhats, the subsequent followers of the “Light of Asia”! Prof. B. Jowett, again, as contemptuously passes the sponge over the “absurd” interpretations of Plato’s Timaeus and the Mosaic Books by the Neo-Platonists. There is not a breath of the Oriental (Gnostic) spirit of Mysticism in Plato’s Dialogues , the Regius Professor of Greek tells us, nor any approach to Science, either. Finally, to cap the climax, Prof. Sayce, the Assyriologist, although he does not deny the actual presence, in the Assyrian tablets and cuneiform literature, of a hidden meaning–– Many of the sacred texts were so written as to be intelligible only to the initiated . . .* yet insists that the “keys and glosses” thereof are now in the hands of the Assyriologists.

In the misty twilight, in the grey dawn of history, stand the pale shadows of the old Sages of world renown. They were hopelessly groping for the correct meaning of their own Mysteries, the spirit whereof has departed without revealing itself to the Hierophants, and has remained latent in space until the advent of the initiates of Modern Science and Research. The noontide brightness of knowledge has only now arrived at the “Know-All,” who, basking in the dazzling sun of induction, busies himself with his Penelopeian task of “working hypotheses,” and loudly asserts his rights to universal knowledge. Can anyone wonder, then, that according to present views the learning of the ancient Philosopher, and even sometimes that of his direct successors in the past centuries, has ever been useless to the world and valueless to himself? For, as explained repeatedly in so many words, while the ¬ ishis and the Sages of old have walked far over the arid fields of myth and superstition, the mediaeval Scholar, and even the average eighteenth century Scientist, have always been more or less cramped by their “supernatural” religion and beliefs. True, it is generally conceded that some ancient and also mediaeval Scholars, such as Pythagoras, Plato, Paracelsus and Roger Bacon, followed by a host of glorious names, had indeed left not a few landmarks over precious mines of Philosophy and unexplored lodes of Physical Science. But then the actual excavation of these, the smelting of the gold and silver, and the cutting of the precious jewels they contain, are all due to the patient labors of the modern man of Science. And is it not to the unparalleled genius of the latter that the ignorant and hitherto deluded world owes a correct knowledge of the real nature of the Kosmos, of the true origin of the universe and man, as revealed in the automatic and mechanical theories of the Physicists, in accordance with strictly scientific Philosophy? Before our cultured era, Science was but a name, Philosophy a delusion and a snare. According to the modest claims of contemporary authority on genuine Science and Philosophy, the Tree of Knowledge has only now sprung from the dead weeds of superstition, as a beautiful butterfly emerges from an ugly grub. We have, therefore, nothing for which to thank our forefathers.

Such, however, is not the view taken by Theosophists. They repeat what was stated twenty years ago. It is not sufficient to speak of the “untenable conceptions of an uncultured past” (Tyndall); of the “ parler enfantin ” of the Vaidic poets (Max Müller); of the “absurdities” of the Neo-Platonists (Jowett); and of the ignorance of the Chaldaeo-Assyrian initiated Priests with regard to their own symbols, when compared with the knowledge thereon of the British Orientalist (Sayce). Such assumptions have to be proven by something more solid than the mere word of these scholars. For no amount of boastful arrogance can hide the intellectual quarries out of which the representations of so many modern Philosophers and Scholars have been carved. How many of the most distinguished European Scientists have derived honour and credit for the mere dressing-up of the ideas of these old Philosophers, whom they are ever ready to disparage, is left to an impartial posterity to say. Thus it does seem not altogether untrue, as stated in Isis Unveiled [II, 103], to say of certain Orientalists and Scholars of dead languages, that they will allow their boundless conceit and self-opinionatedness to run away with their logic and reasoning powers, rather than concede to the ancient Philosophers the knowledge of anything the modern do not know. As part of this work treats of the Initiates and the secret knowledge imparted during the Mysteries, the statements of those who, in spite of the fact that Plato was an Initiate, maintain that no hidden Mysticism is to be discovered in his works, have to be first examined. Too many of the present scholars, Greek and Sanskrit, are but too apt to forego facts in favour of their own preconceived theories based on personal prejudice. They conveniently forget, at every opportunity, not only the numerous changes in language, but also that the allegorical style in the writings of old Philosophers and the secretiveness of the Mystics had their raison d’être ; that both the pre-Christian and the post-Christian classical writers – the great majority at all events – were under the sacred obligation never to divulge the solemn secrets communicated to them in the sanctuaries; and that this alone is sufficient to sadly mislead their translators and I NTRODUCTORY   7 profane critics. But these critics will admit nothing of the kind, as will presently be seen. For over twenty-two centuries everyone who has read Plato has been aware that, like most of the other Greek Philosophers of note, he had been initiated; that therefore, being tied down by the Sodalian Oath, he could speak of certain things only in veiled allegories. His reverence for the Mysteries is unbounded; he openly confesses that he writes “enigmatically,” and we see him take the greatest precautions to conceal the true meaning of his words. Every time the subject touches the greater secrets of Oriental Wisdom – the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"cosmogony of the universe, or the ideal pre-existing world––Plato shrouds his Philosophy in the profoundest darkness. His Timaeus is so confused that no one but an Initiate can understand the hidden meaning. As already said in Isis Unveiled: The speculations of Plato in the Banquet , on the creation [or rather the evolution] of primordial men, and the essay on Cosmogony in the Timaeus , must be taken allegorically, if we accept them at all. It is this hidden Pythagorean meaning in Timaeus, Cratylus , and Parmenides , and a few other trilogies and dialogues, that the Neo-Platonists ventured to expound, as far as the theurgical vow of secrecy would allow them. The Pythagorean doctrine that God is the Universal Mind diffused through all things , and the dogma of the soul’s immortality, are the leading features in these apparently incongruous teachings. His piety and the great veneration Plato felt for the M YSTERIES , are sufficient warrant that he would not allow his indiscretion to get the better of that deep sense of responsibility which is felt by every adept. “Constantly perfecting himself in perfect M YSTERIES , a man in them alone becomes truly perfect,” says he in the Phaedrus [249 C.] He took no pains to conceal his displeasure that the Mysteries had become less secret than formerly. Instead of profaning them by putting them within the reach of the multitude, he would have guarded them with jealous care against all but the most earnest and worthy of his disciples.* While mentioning the gods, on every page, his monotheism is unquestionable, for the whole thread of his discourse indicates that by the term gods he means a class of beings far lower in the scale than deities, and but –––––––––– * This assertion is clearly corroborated by Plato himself, who says: “You say that, in my former discourse, I have not sufficiently explained to you the nature of the First.

Cory, Ancient Fragments , p. 304). –––––––––– 8   B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS one grade higher than men. Even Josephus perceived and acknowledged this fact, despite the natural prejudice of his race. In his famous onslaught upon Apion, this historian says:* “Those, however, among the Greeks who philosophized in accordance with truth , were not ignorant of anything, . . . nor did they fail to perceive the chilling superficialities of the mythical allegories, on which account they justly despised them. . . . By which thing Plato, being moved, says it is not necessary to admit any one of the other poets into ‘the Commonwealth,’ and he dismisses Homer blandly, after having crowned him and pouring unguent upon him, in order that indeed he should not destroy, by his myths , the orthodox belief respecting one God .”† And this is the “God” of every Philosopher, God infinite and impersonal. All this and much more, which there is no room here to quote, leads one to the undeniable certitude that, ( a ) as all the Sciences and Philosophies were in the hands of the temple Hierophants, Plato, as initiated by them, must have known them; and ( b ) that logical inference alone is amply sufficient to justify anyone in regarding Plato’s writings as allegories and “dark sayings,” veiling truths which he had no right to divulge. This established, how comes it that one of the best Greek scholars in England, Prof. Jowett, the modern translator of Plato’s works, seeks to demonstrate that none of the Dialogues – including even the Timaeus ––have any element of Oriental Mysticism about them?

The “knowledge of the parts” avails us little, if this knowledge only leads us the more to ignorance of the Whole, or the “nature and reason of the Universal,” as Plato called Deity, and causes us to blunder most egregiously because of our boasted inductive methods. Plato may have been “incapable of induction or generalization in the modern sense”;* he may have been ignorant also, of the circulation of the blood, which, we are told, “was absolutely unknown to him,”† but then, there is naught to disprove that he knew what blood is – and this is more than any Physiologist or Biologist can claim nowadays. Though a wider and far more generous margin for knowledge is allowed the “physical philosopher” by Prof. Jowett than by nearly any other modern commentator and critic, nevertheless, his criticism so considerably outweighs his laudation, that it may be as well to quote his own words, to show clearly his bias. Thus he says: To bring sense under the control of reason; to find some way through the labyrinth or chaos of appearances, either the highway of mathematics, or more devious paths suggested by the analogy of man with the world, and of the world with man; to see that all things have a cause and are tending towards an end – this is the spirit of the ancient physical philosopher.‡ But we neither appreciate the conditions of knowledge to which he was subjected, nor have the ideas which fastened upon his imagination the same hold upon us. For he is hovering between matter and mind; he is under the dominion of abstractions; his impressions are taken almost at random from the outside of nature; he sees the light, but not the objects which are revealed by the light; and he brings into juxtaposition things which to us appear wide as the poles asunder, because he finds nothing between them. –––––––––– * Op. cit ., p. 561. † Op. cit ., p. 591."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"‡ This definition places (unwittingly, of course), the ancient “physical philosopher” many cubits higher than his modern “physical” confrère , since the ultima Thule of the latter is to lead mankind to believe that neither universe nor man have any cause at all – not an intelligent one at all events – and that they have sprung into existence owing to blind chance and a senseless whirling of atoms.

Whether the Regius Professor of Greek believes or disbelieves in a hidden sense of geometrical figures and of the Esoteric “jargon,” he nevertheless admits the presence of a “double language” in the writings of these Philosophers.

But then Philo lived over 130 years before the birth of the founder of Neo-Platonism He belonged to the School of Aristobulus the Jew, who lived under Ptolemy Philometor (150 years B.C.), and is credited with having inaugurated the movement which tended to prove that Plato and even the Peripatetic Philosophy were derived from the “revealed” Mosaic Books. Valckenaer tries to show that the author of the Commentaries on the Books of Moses , was not Aristobulus, the sycophant of Ptolemy [Cf. Diatribe de Aristobulo, Judaeo, etc ., ed. by J. Juzacio, Lugd.

By the term “canon” is here meant that key which was communicated orally from “mouth to ear” by the Master to the disciple, or by the Hierophant to the candidate for initiation; this from time immemorial throughout a long series of ages, during which the inner – not public – Mysteries were the most sacred institution of every land.

How then can the Rev. Dr. Jowett know that the interpretations made by the Neo-Platonists of the various sacred books of the nations were “absurdities”? Where, again, has he found an opportunity of studying these “interpretations”? History shows that all such works were destroyed by the Christian Church Fathers and their fanatical catechumens, wherever they were found. To say that such men as Ammonius, a genius and a saint, whose learning and holy life earned for him the title of Theodidaktos (“god-taught”), such men as Plotinus, Porphyry, and Proclus, were “incapable of distinguishing between the opinions of one philosopher and another, or between the serious thoughts of Plato and his fancies,” is to assume an untenable position for a Scholar. It amounts to saying that, ( a ) scores of the most famous Philosophers, the greatest Scholars and Sages of Greece and of the Roman Empire were dull fools, and ( b ) that all the other commentators, lovers of Greek Philosophy, some of them the acutest intellects of the age – who do not agree with Dr. Jowett – are also fools and no better than those whom they admire. The patronising tone of the last above-quoted passage is modulated with the most Naive conceit, remarkable even in our age of self-glorification and mutual-admiration cliques. We have to compare the Professor’s views with those of some other scholars. Says Prof. Alexander Wilder of New York, one of the best Platonists of the day, speaking of Ammonius, the founder of the Neo-Platonic School: I NTRODUCTORY   13 His deep spiritual intuition, his extensive learning, his familiarity with the Christian Fathers, Pantaenus, Clement and Athenagoras, and with the most erudite philosophers of the time, all fitted him for the labour which he performed so thoroughly.* He was successful in drawing to his views the greatest scholars and public men of the Roman Empire, who had little taste for wasting time in dialectic pursuits or superstitious observances. The results of his ministration are perceptible at the present day in every country of the Christian world; every prominent system of doctrine now bearing the marks of his plastic hand. Every ancient philosophy has had its votaries among the moderns; and even Judaism . . . has taken upon itself changes which were suggested by the “God-taught” Alexandrian . . . He was a man of rare learning and endowments, of blameless life and amiable disposition.

Porphyry, the disciple of Plotinus, who had lived with Ammonius for eleven years together, and who had no interest in stating an untruth, positively declares that he had renounced Christianity entirely. On the other hand, we know that Ammonius believed in the bright Gods, Protectors, and that the Neo-Platonic Philosophy was as “pagan” as it was mystical. But Eusebius, the most unscrupulous forger and falsifier of old texts, and St. Jerome, an out-and-out fanatic, who had both an interest in denying the fact, contradict Porphyry. We prefer to believe the latter, who has left to posterity an unblemished name and a great reputation for honesty. § Two works are falsely attributed to Ammonius.

He states, contemptuously enough for the ancient methods of intellectual analysis, that: In the present day . . . an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself, and by the contemporary history of thought.† This is like saying that the ancient Greek canon of proportion (if ever found), and the Athena Promachos of Phidias, have to be interpreted in the present day from the contemporary history of architecture and sculpture, from the Albert Hall and Memorial Monument, and the hideous Madonnas in crinolines sprinkled over the fair face of Italy. Prof. Jowett remarks that “mysticism is not criticism.” No; but neither is criticism always fair and sound judgment. La critique est aisée, mais l’art est difficule.

Therefore no great reliance can be placed upon it, nor on its “esoteric” interpretation of the Gospels. Is it this work, we wonder, which led Prof. Jowett to regard the Neo-Platonic interpretations as “absurdities”? * Wilder, op. cit ., p. 7. † Jowett, op. cit ., III, p. 524. –––––––––– I NTRODUCTORY   15 Pythagoras and Plato, since he denies even in the Timaeus an element of Oriental Mysticism, and seeks to show Greek Philosophy reacting upon the East, forgetting that the truth is the exact reverse; that it is “the deeper and more pervading spirit of Orientalism” that had–through Pythagoras and his own initiation into the Mysteries–penetrated into the very depths of Plato’s soul. But Dr. Jowett does not see this. Nor is he prepared to admit that anything good or rational–in accordance with the “contemporary history of thought”––could ever come out of that Nazareth of the Pagan Mysteries; nor even that there is anything to interpret of a hidden nature in the Timaeus or any other Dialogue . For him, The so-called mysticism of Plato is purely Greek, arising out of his imperfect knowledge* and high aspirations, and is the growth of an age in which philosophy is not wholly separated from poetry and mythology.† Among several other equally erroneous propositions, it is especially the assumptions ( a ) that Plato was entirely free from any element of Eastern Philosophy in his writings, and ( b ) that every modern scholar, without being a Mystic and a Kabalist himself, can pretend to judge of ancient Esotericism–which we mean to combat. To do this we have to produce more authoritative statements than our own would be, and bring the evidence of other scholars as great as Dr. Jowett, if not greater, specialists in their subjects, moreover, to bear on and destroy the arguments of the Oxford Regius Professor of Greek. That Plato was undeniably an ardent admirer and follower of Pythagoras no one will deny.

Science strikes out, at its own sweet will and fancy, dozens of names of ancient heroes, simply because there is too great an element of myth in their histories; the Church insists that biblical patriarchs shall be regarded as historical personages, and terms her seven “Star-angels” the “historical channels and agents of the Creator.” Both are right, since each finds a strong party to side with it.

And yet, if the evidence of facts, the records preserved in History, and the uninterrupted anathemas of the Church against “Black Magic” and Magicians of the accursed race of Cain, are not to be heeded, our efforts will prove very puny indeed.

Those missionaries who have lived in the country for long years, and have seriously studied every fact and belief that may prove an obstacle to their success in making 18   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS conversions, and who have become familiar with every exoteric rite of both the official religion and sectarian creeds–all swear to the existence of a certain body of men, whom no one can reach but the Emperor and a select body of high officials. A few years ago, before the war in Tonkin, the archbishop in Pekin, on the report of some hundreds of missionaries and Christians, wrote to Rome the identical story that had been reported twenty-five years before, and had been widely circulated in clerical papers. They had fathomed, it was said, the mystery of certain official deputations, sent at times of danger by the Emperor and ruling powers to their Shen and Kuei, as they are called among the people. These Shen and Kuei, they explained, were the Genii of the mountains, endowed with the most miraculous powers. They are regarded as the protectors of China, by the “ignorant” masses; as the incarnation of Satanic power by the good and “learned” missionaries. The Shen and Kuei are men belonging to another state of being to that of the ordinary man, or to the state they enjoyed while they were clad in their bodies. They are disembodied spirits, ghosts and larvae, living, nevertheless, in objective form on earth, and dwelling in the fastnesses of mountains, inaccessible to all but those whom they permit to visit them.* In Tibet certain ascetics are also called Lha, Spirits, by those with whom they do not choose to communicate. The Shen and Kuei, who enjoy the highest consideration of the Emperor and Philosophers, and of Confucianists who believe in no “Spirits,” are simply Lohans–Adepts who live in the greatest solitude in their unknown retreats. But both Chinese exclusiveness and Nature seem to have allied themselves against European curiosity and–as it is sincerely regarded in Tibet–desecration.

The doctrines of ∠∼ kya, as they prevailed in Udyána in old times , were probably strongly tinged with ∠ ivaitic magic, and the Tibetans still regard that locality as the classic ground of sorcery and witchcraft.” The “old times” are just like the “modern times”; nothing is changed as to magical practices except that they have become still more esoteric and arcane, and that the caution of the adepts increases in proportion to the traveller’s curiosity. Hiuen-Tsang says of the inhabitants: “The men . . . are fond of study, but pursue it with no ardour. The science of magical formula has become a regular professional business with them .”† We will not contradict the venerable Chinese pilgrim on this point, and are willing to admit that in the seventh century some people made “a professional business” of magic; so, also, do some people now, but certainly not the true adepts. [Moreover, in that century, Buddhism had hardly penetrated into Tibet, and its races were steeped in the sorceries of the Bön,–the pre-lamaic religion.] It is not Hiuen-Tsang, the pious, courageous man, who risked his life a hundred times to have the bliss of perceiving Buddha’s shadow in the cave of Pesh ∼ war, who would have accused the holy lamas and monkish thaumaturgists of “making a professional business” of showing it to travellers. The injunction of Gautama, contained in his answer to King Prasenajit, his protector, who called on him to perform miracles, must have been ever-present to the mind of Hiuen-Tsang. “Great king,” said Gautama, “I do not teach the law to my pupils, telling them, ‘Go, ye saints, and before the eyes of the Br ∼ hmans and householders perform, by means of your supernatural powers, miracles greater than any man can perform.’I tell them, when I teach them the law, ‘Live, ye saints, hiding your good works, and showing your sins .’ ” Struck with the accounts of magical exhibitions witnessed and recorded by travellers of every age who had visited Tartary and Tibet, Colonel Yule comes to the conclusion that the natives must have had “at their command –––––––––– * The regions somewhere about Udyána and Kashmir, as the translator and editor of Marco Polo (Colonel Henry Yule) believes.

When Hiuen-Tsang desired to adore the shadow of Buddha, it was not to “professional magicians” that he resorted, but to the power of his own soul-invocation; the power of prayer, faith, and contemplation. All was dark and dreary near the cavern in which the miracle was alleged to take place sometimes. Hiuen-Tsang entered and began his devotions. He made one hundred salutations, but neither saw nor heard anything. Then, thinking himself too sinful, he cried bitterly, and despaired. But as he was going to give up all hope, he perceived on the eastern wall a feeble light, but it disappeared. He renewed his prayers, full of hope this time, and again he saw the light, which flashed and disappeared again. After this he made a solemn vow: he would not leave the cave till he had the rapture to see at last the shadow of the “Venerable of the Age.” He had to wait longer after this, for only after two hundred prayers was the dark cave suddenly “bathed in light, and the shadow of Buddha, of a brilliant white colour, rose majestically on the wall, as when the clouds suddenly open and, all at once, display the marvellous image of the Mountain of Light.’ A dazzling splendour lighted up the features of the divine countenance.

So sacred was it deemed that its existence was only half-admitted, and it was only practiced in public emergencies. It was more than a religious matter, for it was [and is still] considered divine . The Egyptian hierophants, notwithstanding the practice of a stern and pure morality, could not be compared for one moment with the ascetical Gymnosophists, either in holiness of life or miraculous powers developed in them by the supernatural abjuration of everything earthly. By those who knew them well they were held in still greater reverence than the magians of Chaldea. “Denying themselves the simplest comforts of life, they dwelt in woods, and led the life of the most secluded hermits,”* while their Egyptian brothers at least congregated together.

Whenever a writer has tried to connect the first foundation of Magic with a particular country or some historical event or character, further research has shown his hypothesis to be groundless. There is a most lamentable contradiction among the Symbologists on this point. Some would have it that Odin, the Scandinavian priest and monarch, originated the practice of Magic some 70 years B.C. , although it is spoken of repeatedly in the Bible . But as it was proven that the mysterious rites of the priestesses Valas (Völvas) were greatly anterior to Odin’s age,* then Zoroaster came in for an attempt, on the ground that he was the founder of Magian rites; but Ammianus Marcellinus, Pliny and Arnobius, with other ancient Historians, have shown that Zoroaster was but a reformer of Magic as practiced by the Chaldeans and Egyptians, and not at all its founder.† Who, then, of those who have consistently turned their faces away from Occultism and even Spiritualism, as being “unphilosophical” and therefore unworthy of scientific thought, has a right to say that he has studied the Ancients; or that, if he has studied them, he has understood all they have said?

[In this respect the opinion of Democritus] is of the greatest importance to us, since the Magi left by Xerxes at Abdera, were his instructors, and he had studied magic, moreover, for a considerable time with the Egyptian priests.† For nearly ninety years of the one hundred and nine of his life, this great philosopher had made experiments, and noted them down in a book, which, according to Petronius,‡ treated of nature ––facts that he had verified himself.

But this matters very little. The vindication of the Occultists and their Archaic Science is working itself slowly but steadily into the very heart of society, hourly, daily, and yearly, in the shape of two monster branches, two stray off-shoots of the trunk of Magic–Spiritualism and the Roman Church.

Thus are the professedly public “brotherhoods” of “black” adepts more powerful and dangerous for Protestant countries than any host of Eastern Occultists. People laugh at Magic! Men of Science, Physiologists and Biologists, deride the potency and even the belief in the existence of what is called in vulgar parlance “Sorcery” and “Black Magic”. The archaeologists have their Stonehenge in England with its thousands of secrets, and its twin-brother Carnac of Brittany, and yet there is not one of them who even suspects what has been going on in its crypts, and its mysterious nooks and corners, for the last century. More than that, they do not even know of the existence of such “magic halls” in their Stonehenge, where curious scenes are taking place, whenever there is a new convert in view. Hundreds of experiments have been, and are being made daily at the Salp ‘ trière, and also by learned hypnotisers at their private houses. It is now proved that certain sensitives–both men and women–when commanded in trance, by the practitioner, who operates on them, to do a certain thing–from drinking a glass of water up to simulated murder–on recovering their normal state lose all remembrance of the order inspired– “suggested” it is now called by Science. Nevertheless, at the appointed hour and moment, the subject, though conscious and perfectly awake, is compelled by an irresistible power within himself to do that action which has been suggested to him by his mesmeriser; and that too, whatever it may be, and whatever the period fixed by him who controls the subject, that is to say, holds the latter under the power of his will, as a snake holds a bird under its fascination, and finally forces it to jump into its open jaws. Worse than this: for the bird is conscious of the peril; it resists, however helpless in its final efforts, while the hypnotized subject does not rebel, but seems to follow the suggestions and voice of its own free will and soul. Who of our European men of Science, who believe in such scientific experiments – and very few are they who still doubt them now-a-days, and who do not feel convinced of their actual reality–who of them, it is asked, is ready to admit this as being Black Magic? Yet it is the genuine , undeniable and actual fascination and sorcery of old.

The conscience of the Roman Catholic priest is most likely at peace. He works personally for no selfish purpose, but with the object of “saving a soul” from “eternal damnation.” In his view, if Magic there be in it, it is holy, meritorious and divine Magic. Such is the power of blind faith. Hence, when we are assured by trustworthy and respectable persons of high social standing, and unimpeachable character, that there are many well-organized societies among the Roman Catholic priests which, under the pretext and cover of Modern Spiritualism and mediumship, hold séances for the purposes of conversion by suggestion, directly and at a distance–we answer: We know it. And when, moreover, we are told that whenever those priest-hypnotists are desirous of acquiring an influence over some individual or individuals, selected by them for conversion, they retire to an underground place, allotted and consecrated by them for such purposes ( viz. , ceremonial Magic); and there, forming a circle, throw their combined will-power in the direction of that individual, and thus by repeating the process, gain a complete control over their victim–we again answer: Very likely. In fact we know the practice to be so, whether this kind of ceremonial Magic and envo ū tement is practiced at Stonehenge or elsewhere. We know it, we say, P RELIMINARY S URVEY   31 through personal experience; and also because several of the writer’s best and most loved friends have been unconsciously drawn into the Romish Church and under her “benign” protection by such means. And, therefore, we can only laugh in pity at the ignorance and stubbornness of those deluded men of Science and cultured experimentalists who, while believing in the power of Dr. Charcot and his disciples to “envoûte” their subjects, find nothing better than a scornful smile whenever Black Magic and its potency are mentioned before them. Éliphas Lévi, the Abbé- Kabalist, died before Science and the Faculté de Médecine of France had accepted hypnotism and influence par suggestion among its scientific experiments, but this is what he said twenty-five years ago, in his Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie , on “Les Envo  tements et les Sorts”: That which sorcerers and necromancers sought above all things in their evocations of the Spirit of Evil, was that magnetic potency which is the lawful property of the true Adept, and which they desired to obtain possession of for evil purposes . . . . One of their chief aims was the power of spells or of deleterious influences . . . . That power may be compared to real poisonings by a current of astral light. They exalt their will by means of ceremonies to the degree of rendering it venomous at a distance . . . . We have said in our “Dogma” what we thought of magic spells, and how this power was exceedingly real and dangerous. The true Magus throws a spell without ceremony and by his sole disapproval, upon those with whose conduct he is dissatisfied, and whom he thinks it necessary to punish;* he casts a spell, even by his pardon, over those who do him injury, and the enemies of Initiates never long enjoy impunity for their wrong-doing. We have ourselves seen proofs of this fatal law in numerous instances. The executioners of martyrs always perish miserably; and the Adepts are the martyrs of intelligence. Providence [Karma] seems to despise those who"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"despise them, and puts to death those who would seek to prevent them from living. The legend of the Wandering Jew is the popular poetry of this arcanum. A people had sent a sage to crucifixion; that people had bidden him “Move on!” when he tried to rest for one moment. Well! that people will become subject, henceforth, to a similar condemnation; it will become entirely proscribed, and for long centuries it will be bidden “Move on! move on!” finding neither rest nor pity.† –––––––––– * This is incorrectly expressed.

Before the lethal breath of selfishness and indifference every uncomfortable fact is transformed into meaningless fiction, and every branch of the once verdant Tree of Truth has become dried up and stripped of its primeval spiritual significance. Our modern Symbologist is superlatively clever only at detecting phallic worship and sexual emblems even where none were ever meant. But for the true student of Occult Lore, White or Divine Magic could no more exist in Nature without its counterpart Black Magic, than day without night, whether these be of twelve hours or of six months’ duration. For him everything in that Nature has an occult–a bright and a night-side to it. Pyramids and Druid’s oaks, dolmens and Bo-trees, plant and mineral–everything was full of deep significance and of sacred truths of wisdom, when the Arch-Druid performed his magic cures and incantations, and the Egyptian Hierophant evoked and guided Chemnu, the “lovely spectre,” the female Frankenstein-creation of old, raised for the torture and test of the soul-power of the candidate for initiation, simultaneously with the last agonizing cry of his terrestrial human nature. True, Magic has lost its name, and along with it its rights to recognition. But its practice is in daily use; and its progeny, “magnetic influence,” “power of oratory,” “irresistible fascination,” “whole audiences subdued and held as though under a spell,” are terms recognized and used by all, generally meaningless though they now are. Its effects, however, are more determined and definite among religious congregations such as the Shakers, the Negro Methodists, and Salvationists, who call it “the action of the Holy Spirit” and “grace.” The real truth is that Magic is still in full sway amidst mankind, however blind the latter to its silent presence and influence on its members, however ignorant society may be, and remain, to its daily and hourly beneficent and maleficent effects.

Fore very effort made by him to remove the universal cecity is only repaid with ingratitude, slander, and often curses, which, unable to reach him, will react on those who wish him evil. Lies and calumny–the latter a teething lie, adding actual bites to empty harmless falsehoods –become his lot, and thus the well-wisher is soon torn to pieces, as a reward for his benevolent desire to enlighten. Enough has been given, it is believed, to show that the existence of a Secret Universal Doctrine, besides its practical methods of Magic, is no wild romance or fiction. The fact was known to the whole ancient world, and the knowledge of it has survived in the East, in India especially. And if there be such a Science, there must be naturally, somewhere, professors of it, or Adepts. In any case it matters little whether the Guardians of the Sacred Lore are regarded as living, actually existing men, or are viewed as myths. It is their Philosophy that will have to stand or fall upon its own merits, apart from, and independent of any Adepts.

Each and all of them have invariably recommended silence and secrecy on certain facts and deeds; from Confucius, who refused to explain publicly and satisfactorily 34   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS what he meant by his “Great Extreme,” or to give the key to the divination by “straws,” down to Jesus, who charged his disciples to tell no man that he was Christ* ( Chr ē stos ) , the “man of sorrows” and trials, before his supreme and last Initiation, or that he had produced a “miracle” of resurrection.† The Apostles had to preserve silence, so that the left hand should not know what the right hand did; in plainer words, that the dangerous proficients in the Left Hand Science–the terrible enemies of the Right Hand Adepts, especially before their supreme Initiation–should not profit by the publicity so as to harm both the healer and the patient. And if the above is maintained to be simply an assumption, then what may be the meaning of these awful words: Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables; that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them.‡ Unless interpreted in the sense of the law of silence and Karma, the utter selfishness and uncharitable spirit of this remark are but too evident.

Namely, lest any of the profane should by understanding his preaching, undisguised by parable, get hold of some of the secret teachings and mysteries"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"of Initiation–and even of Occult powers. “Be converted” is, in other words, to obtain a knowledge belonging exclusively to the Initiated; “and their sins be forgiven them,” that is, their sins would fall upon the illegal revealer, on those who had helped the unworthy to reap there where they have never labored to sow, and had given them, thereby, the means of escaping on this earth their deserved Karma, which must thus react on the revealer, who, instead of good, did harm and failed. –––––––––– T HE S ECRECY O F I NITIATES   35 The work of propagating such truths in parables was left to the disciples of the high Initiates. It was their duty to follow the keynote of the Secret Teaching without revealing its mysteries. This is shown in the histories of all the great Adepts. Pythagoras divided his classes into hearers of exoteric and esoteric lectures. The Magians received their instructions and were initiated in the far hidden caves of Bactria. When Josephus declares that Abraham taught Mathematics he meant by it “Magic,” for in the Pythagorean code Mathematics mean Esoteric Science, or Gnosis.

This injunction destroys the usual affirmation that “Holy Writ” is the only book in the world whose divine oracles contain plain unvarnished truth. It may be so for the learned Kabalists; it is certainly quite the reverse with regard to Christians. For this is what the learned Hebrew Philosopher says: Whoever shall find out the true sense of the Book of Genesis ought to take care not to divulge it. This is a maxim that all our sages repeat to us, and above all respecting the work of the six days.

It is personal selfishness that develops and urges man on to abuse of his knowledge and power. And selfishness is a human building, whose windows and doors are ever wide open for every kind of iniquity to enter into man’s soul. Few were the men during the early adolescence of mankind, and fewer still are they now, who feel disposed to put into practice Pope’s forcible declaration that he would tear out his own heart, if it had no better disposition than to love only himself, and laugh at all his neighbours. Hence the necessity of gradually taking away from man the divine knowledge and power, which became with every new human cycle more dangerous as a double-edged weapon, whose evil side was ever threatening one’s neighbour, and whose power for good was lavished freely only upon self. Those few “elect” whose inner natures had remained unaffected by their outward physical growth, thus became in time the sole guardians of the mysteries revealed, passing the knowledge to those most fit to receive it, and keeping it inaccessible to others. Reject this explanation from the Secret Teachings, and the very name of Religion will become synonymous with deception and fraud. Yet the masses could not be allowed to remain without some sort of moral restraint. Man is ever craving for a “beyond” and cannot live without an ideal of some kind, as a beacon and a consolation. At the same time, no average man, even in our age of universal education, could be entrusted with truths too metaphysical, too subtle for his mind to comprehend, without the danger of an imminent reaction setting in, and faith in Gods and Saints making room for an unscientific blank Atheism.

The hour has struck with the commencement of this century to dethrone the “highest God” of every nation in favour of One Universal Deity–the God of Immutable Law, not charity; the God of Just Retribution, not mercy, which is merely an incentive to evil-doing and to a repetition of it. The greatest crime that was ever perpetrated upon mankind was committed on that day when the first priest invented the first prayer with a selfish object in view. A God who may be propitiated by iniquitous prayers to “bless the arms” of the worshipper, and send defeat and death to thousands of his enemies–his brethren; a Deity that can be supposed not to turn a deaf ear to chants of laudation mixed with entreaties for a “fair propitious wind” for self, and as naturally disastrous to the selves of other navigators who come from an opposite direction–it is this idea of God that has fostered selfishness in man, and deprived him of his self-reliance. Prayer is an ennobling action when it is an intense feeling, an ardent desire rushing forth from our very heart, for the good of other people, and when entirely detached from any selfish personal object; the craving for a beyond is natural and holy in man, but on the condition of sharing that bliss with others. One can understand and well appreciate the words of the “heathen” Socrates, who declared in his profound though untaught wisdom, that: Our prayers should be for blessings on all, in general, for the Gods know best what is good for us.* But official prayer–in favour of a public calamity, or for the benefit of one individual irrespective of losses to thousands–is the most ignoble of crimes, besides being an impertinent conceit and a superstition. This is the direct inheritance by spoliation from the Jehovites–the Jews of the Wilderness and of the Golden Calf. It is “Jehovah,” as will be presently shown, that suggested the necessity of veiling and screening this substitute for the unpronounceable name, and that led to all this “mystery, –––––––––– * [See Plato’s Laws , Books 3, 7 & 10 (¶ 900 etc.); as well as Intro. to Bk.

They have disfigured the grand central figure of Christ by their dogmas, and have led people ever since into millions of errors and the darkest crimes, in His holy name. It is evident that with the exception of Paul and Clement of Alexandria, who had been both initiated into the Mysteries, none of the Fathers knew much of the truth themselves. They were mostly uneducated, ignorant people; and if such as Augustine and Lactantius, or again the Venerable Bede and others, were so painfully ignorant until the time of Galileo* of the most vital truths taught in the Pagan temples–of the rotundity of the earth, for example, leaving the heliocentric system out of question–how great must have been the ignorance of the rest! Learning and sin were synonymous with the early Christians. Hence the accusations of dealing with the Devil lavished on the Pagan Philosophers. But truth must out. The Occultists, referred to as “the followers of the accursed Cain,” by such writers as de Mirville, are now in a position to reverse the tables. That which was hitherto known only to the ancient and modern Kabalists in Europe and Asia, is now published and shown as being mathematically true.

If so, so much the worse for the Latin Church, since her Popes, knowing of it, still preserved silence upon this most important fact, either to screen Joshua or their own infallibility.

But if it be so they will profit still less by it, as the admission would involve more for them than the mere sacredness and dignity of the established faith. But, it may also be asked, why is it that the Asiatic religions, which have nothing of this sort to conceal and which proclaim quite openly the Esotericism of their doctrines, follow the same course? It is simply this: While the present, and no doubt enforced silence of the Church on this subject relates merely to the external or theoretical form of the Bible –the unveiling of the secrets of which would have involved no practical harm, had they been explained from the first–it is an entirely different question with Eastern Esotericism and Symbology. The grand central figure of the Gospels would have remained as –––––––––– * Op. cit ., App. vii, p. 296. The writer feels happy to find this fact now mathematically demonstrated. When it was stated in Isis Unveiled that Jehovah and Saturn were one and the same with Adam-Kadmon, Cain, Adam and Eve, Able, Seth, etc., and that all were convertible symbols in The Secret Doctrine (see Vol. II, pp. 446, 448, 464 et seq .); that they answered, in short, to secret numerals and stood for more than one meaning in the Bible as in other doctrines–the author’s statements remained unnoticed. Isis had failed to appear under a scientific form, and by giving too much, in fact, gave very little to satisfy the enquirer. But now, if mathematics and geometry, besides the evidence of the Bible and Kabalah are good for anything, the public must find itself satisfied. No fuller, more scientifically given proof can be found to show that Cain is the transformation of an El ∩ h ♣ m (the Seph ♣ r ∼ h B ♣ n ∼ h) into Yah-Veh (or God-Eve) androgyne, and that Seth is the Jehovah male, than in the combined discoveries of Seyffarth, Knight, etc., and finally in Mr. Ralston Skinner’s most erudite work.

Whence did Ariosto, in his Orlando Furioso , obtain his conception of that valley of the Moon, where after our death we can find the ideas and images of all that exists on earth?

It has been alleged that the Guardians of the Secret Lore were selfish in withholding the “treasures” of Archaic Wisdom; that it was positively criminal to keep back such knowledge–“if any”–from the men of Science, etc. Yet there must have been some very good reasons for it, since from the very dawn of History such has been the policy of every Hierophant and “Master.” Pythagoras, the first Adept and real Scientist in pre-Christian Europe, is accused of having taught in public the immobility of the earth, and the rotary motion of the stars around it, while he was declaring to his privileged Adepts his belief in the motion of the Earth as a planet, and in the heliocentric system. The reasons for such secrecy, however, are many and were never made a mystery of. The chief cause was given in Isis Unveiled . It may now be repeated. From the very day when the first mystic [taught by the first Instructor of the “divine Dynasties” of the early races, was taught] the means of communication between this world and the worlds of the invisible host, between the sphere of matter and that of pure spirit, he concluded that to abandon this mysterious science to the [desecration, willing or unwilling, of the profane] rabble–was to lose it.

If initiated, he learnt it as a sacred science; if otherwise, then, like Socrates, repeating to himself as well as his fellowmen, the noble injunction, “O man, know thyself,” he succeeded in recognizing his God within himself. “Ye are gods,” the king-psalmist tells us, and we find Jesus reminding the scribes that this expression was addressed to other mortal men, claiming for themselves the same privilege without any blasphemy.* And, as a faithful echo, Paul, while asserting that we are all “the temple of the living God,”† cautiously adds that after all these things are only for the “wise,” and it is “unlawful” to speak of them.‡ Some of the reasons for this secrecy may here be given."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The fundamental law and master-key of practical Theurgy, in its chief applications to the serious study of cosmic and sidereal, of psychic and spiritual, mysteries was, and still is, that which was called by the Greek Neo-Platonists “Theophania.” In its generally-accepted meaning this is “communication between the Gods (or God) and those initiated mortals who are spiritually fit to enjoy such an intercourse.” Esoterically, however, it signifies more than this. For it is not only the presence of a God, but an actual–howbeit temporary–incarnation, the blending, so to say, of the personal Deity, the Higher Self, with man–its representative or agent on earth. As a general law, the Highest God, the Over-soul of the human being (Atma-Buddhi), only over-shadows the individual during his life, for purposes of instruction and revelation; or as Roman Catholics–who erroneously call that Over-soul the “Guardian Angel”–would say, “It stands outside and watches.” But in the case of the theophanic mystery, it incarnates itself in the Theurgist for purposes of revelation.

Now that which is meant here by the personal God of Man is, of course, not his seventh Principle alone, as per se and in essence that is merely a beam of the infinite Ocean of Light.

This is the most difficult–because so transcendentally metaphysical–portion of the doctrine. As is repeated many a time in this and other works, it is not the Philosophers, Sages, and Adepts of antiquity who can ever be charged with idolatry. It is they in fact, who, recognising divine unity, were the only ones, owing to their initiation into the mysteries of Esotericism, to understand correctly the ύπόνοια (hyponoia), or under-meaning of the a nthropomorphism of the so-called Angels, Gods, and spiritual Beings of every kind.

The holy Triad emanates from the One, and is the Tetraktys; the gods, daimons, and souls are an emanation of the Triad. Heroes and men repeat the hierarchy in themselves. Thus said Metrodorus of Chios, the Pythagorean, the latter part of the sentence meaning that man has within himself the seven pale reflections of the seven divine Hierarchies; his Higher Self is, therefore, in itself but the refracted beam of the direct Ray. He who regards the latter as an Entity, in the usual sense of the term, is one of the “infidels and atheists,” spoken of by Epicurus, for he fastens on that God “the opinions of the multitude”–an anthropomorphism of the grossest kind.† The Adept and the Occultist know that “what are styled the Gods are only the first principles.”‡ None the less they are intelligent, –––––––––– * This would be in one sense Self-worship. † “The Gods exist,” said Epicurus, “but they are not what the hoi polloi (the multitude) suppose them to be.

And it is they again, the Dhy ∼ ni-Chohans, who are the prototypes in the ae ∩ nic eternity of lower Gods and hierarchies of divine Beings, at the lowest end of which ladder of being are we–men. Thus perchance Polytheism, when philosophically understood, may be a degree higher than even the Monotheism of the Protestant, say, who limits and conditions the Deity in whom he persists in seeing the Infinite, but whose supposed actions make of that “Absolute and Infinite” the most absurd paradox in Philosophy. From this standpoint Roman Catholicism itself is immeasurably higher and more logical than Protestantism, though the Roman Church has been pleased to adopt the exotericism of the heathen “multitude” and to reject the Philosophy of pure Esotericism. Thus every mortal has his immortal counterpart, or rather his Archetype, in heaven. This means that the former is indissolubly united to the latter, in each of his incarnations, and for the duration of the cycle of births; only it is by the spiritual and intellectual Principle in him, entirely distinct from the lower self , never through the earthly personality. Some of these are even liable to break the union altogether, in case of absence in the moral individual of binding, viz ., of spiritual ties. Truly, as Paracelsus puts it in his quaint, tortured phraseology, man with his three (compound) Spirits is suspended like a foetus by all three to the matrix of the Macrocosm; the thread which holds him united being the “Thread-Soul,” S  tr ∼ t man, and Taijasa (the “Shining”) of the Ved ∼ ntins. And it is through this spiritual and intellectual Principle in man, through Taijasa–the Shining, “because it has the luminous internal organ as its associate”–that man is thus united to his heavenly prototype, never through his lower inner self or Astral Body, for which there remains in most cases nothing but to fade out. Occultism, or Theurgy, teaches the means of producing such union. But it is the actions of man–his personal merit alone that can produce it on earth, or determine its duration. This lasts from a few seconds–a flash–to several hours, during which time the Theurgist or Theophanist is that overshadowing “God” 52   B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS himself; hence he becomes endowed for the time being with relative omniscience and"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"omnipotence.

The degree of recollection, when one returns to his waking state and physical senses, depends on his spiritual and psychic purification, the greatest enemy of spiritual memory being man’s physical brain, the organ of his sensuous nature. The above states are described for a clearer comprehension of terms used in this work. There are so many and such various conditions and states that even a Seer is liable to confound one with the other. To repeat: the Greek, rarely-used word, “Theophania,” meant more with the Neo-Platonists than it does with the modern maker of dictionaries. The compound word, Theophania (from theos , “God,” and phainesthai , “to appear,”) does not simply mean “a manifestation of God to man by actual appearance”–an absurdity, by the way–but the actual presence of a God in man, a divine incarnation.

This is one of the several mysteries of being and incarnation. Another is that when an Adept reaches during his lifetime that state of holiness and purity that makes him “equal to the Angels,” then at death his apparitional or astral body becomes as solid and tangible as was the late body, and is transformed into the real man.† The old physical body, falling off like the cast-off serpent’s skin, the body of the “new” man remains either visible or, at the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"option of the Adept, disappears from view, surrounded as it is by the } k ∼∇ ic shell that screens it. In the latter case there are three ways open to the Adept: (1) He may remain in the earth’s sphere (V ∼ yu or K ∼ ma-loka), in that ethereal locality concealed from human sight save during flashes of clairvoyance. In this case his astral body, owing to its great purity and spirituality, having lost the conditions required for } k ∼∇ ic light (the nether or terrestrial ether) to absorb its semi-material particles, the Adept will have to remain in the company of disintegrating shells–doing no good or useful work.

As to ecstasy, and such like kinds of self-illumination, this may be obtained by oneself and without any teacher or initiation, for ecstasy is reached by an inward command and control of Self over the physical Ego; as to obtaining mastery over the forces of Nature, this requires a long training, or the capacity of one born a “natural Magician.” Meanwhile, those who possess neither of the requisite qualifications are strongly advised to limit themselves to purely spiritual development. But even this is difficult, as the first necessary qualification is an unshakable belief in one’s own powers and the Deity within oneself; otherwise a man would simply develop into an irresponsible medium. Throughout the whole mystic literature of the ancient world we detect the same idea of spiritual Esotericism, that the personal God exists within, nowhere outside, the worshipper. That personal Deity is no vain breath, or a fiction, but an immortal Entity, the Initiator of the Initiates, now that the heavenly or Celestial Initiators of primitive humanity–the ∠ ishtas of the preceding cycles–are no more among us. Like an under-current, rapid and clear, it runs without mixing its crystalline purity with the muddy and troubled waters of S OME R EASONS F OR S ECRECY   55 dogmatism, an enforced anthropomorphic Deity and religious intolerance. We find this idea in the tortured and barbarous phraseology of the Codex Nazaraeus ,* and in the superb Neo-Platonic language of the Fourth Gospel of the later Religion, in the oldest Veda and in the Avesta , in the Abhidharma , in Kapila’s S ā nkhya - S ū tras , and the Bhagavad - G ī t ā [and in P atanjali’s Yoga Sutras ]. We cannot attain Adeptship and Nirv ∼ Š a, Bliss and the “Kingdom of Heaven,” unless we link ourselves indissolubly with our Rex Lucis , the Lord of Splendour and of Light, our immortal God within us. Aham eva Parabrahman –“I am verily the Supreme Brahman”–has ever been the one living truth in the heart and mind of the Adepts, and it is this which helps the Mystic to become one. One must first of all recognize one’s own immortal Principle, and then only can one conquer, or take the Kingdom of Heaven by violence. Only this has to be achieved by the higher–not the middle, nor the third–man, the last one being of dust. Nor can the second man, the “Son”–on this plane, as his “Father” is the Son on a still higher plane–do anything without the assistance of the first, the “Father.” But to succeed one has to identify oneself with one’s divine Parent. The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second [inner, our higher] man is the Lord from heaven . . . . Behold, I show you a mystery.† Thus says Paul, mentioning but the dual and trinitarian man for the better comprehension of the non-initiated. But this is not all, for the Delphic injunction has to be fulfilled: man must know himself in order to become a perfect Adept.

Only the Ved ∼ ntin, who never refers to his body as being himself, or even a part of himself, or aught else but an illusory form for others to see him in, constructs his assertion more openly and sincerely than was done by Paul. The Delphic command “Know thyself” was perfectly comprehensible to every nation of old. So it is now, save to the Christians, since, with the exception of the Moslems, it is part and parcel of every Eastern religion, including the Kabalistically instructed Jews. To understand its full meaning, however, necessitates, first of all, belief in Reincarnation and all its mysteries; not as laid down in the doctrine of the French Reincarnationists of the Allan Kardec school, but as they are expounded and taught by Esoteric Philosophy. Man must, in short, know who he was, before he arrives at knowing what he is.

Now the utter absurdity of any man becoming as perfect as the infinite, all-perfect, omniscient and omnipresent Deity, is too apparent. If you accept it in such a sense, Jesus is made to utter the greatest fallacy. What was Esoterically meant is, “Your Father who is above the material and astral man, the highest Principle (save the Monad) within man, his own personal God, or the God of his own personality, of whom he is the ‘prison’ and the ‘temple.’” “If thou wilt be perfect ( i.e. , an Adept and Initiate), go and sell that thou hast” ( Matt . xix, 21). Every man who desired to become a neophyte, a chela, then, as now, had to take the vow of poverty. The “Perfect” was the name given to the Initiates of every denomination.

This cannot be achieved at once, for to benefit mankind such truths have to be revealed gradually and with great caution, the public mind not being prepared for them.

Let, then, the world cling to its Gods, to whatever plane or realm they may belong. The true Occultist would be guilty of high treason to mankind, were he to break forever the old deities before he could replace them with the whole and unadulterated truth–and this he cannot do as yet. Nevertheless, the reader may be allowed to learn at least the alphabet of that truth.

His impression seems to be that because the Jewish biblical names are all astronomical, therefore the Scriptures of all the other nations can be “only this and nothing more.” But this is a great mistake of the erudite and wonderfully acute author of The Source of Measures , if he really thinks so.

How many more similar instances may not be found in the Bible , the last and latest of the Occult works of antiquity?

There was a time also when the Wisdom-Religion was not symbolical, for it became Esoteric only gradually, the change being necessitated by misuse and by the Sorcery of the Atlanteans.

Moses understood the great danger of delivering such truths to the selfish, for he understood the fable of Prometheus and remembered the past. Hence, he veiled them from the profanation of public gaze and gave them out allegorically. And this is why his biographer says of him, that when he descended from Sinai, Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone . . . and he put a veil upon his face.* And so he “put a veil” upon the face of his Pentateuch ; and to such an extent that, using orthodox chronology, only 3376 years after the event people begin to acquire a conviction that it is “a veil indeed.” It is not the face of God or even of a Jehovah shining through; not even the face of Moses, but verily the faces of the later Rabbis.

Nor is it probable that the Greek Church knew much of it, the separation between the two having occurred at a time when, in the struggle for political power, the Latin Church was securing, at any cost, the alliance of the highly educated, the ambitious and influential Pagans, while these were willing to assume the outward appearance of the new worship, provided they were themselves kept in power. There is no need to remind the reader here of the details of that struggle, well-known to every educated man. It is certain that the highly cultivated Gnostics and their leaders–such men as Saturninus, an uncompromising ascetic, as Marcion, Valentinus, Basilides, Menander and Cerinthus–were not stigmatised by the (now) Latin Church because they were heretics, nor because their tenets and practices were indeed “ ob turpitudinem portentosam nimium et horribilem ,”* “monstrous, revolting abominations,” as Baronius says of those of Carpocrates; but simply because they knew too much of fact and truth.

The Ferouer was never the “principle of sensations,” but always referred to the most divine and pure portion of Man’s Ego–the spiritual principle. Anquetil says the Ferouer is the purest portion of man’s soul. The Persian Dev is the antithesis of the Ferouer, for the Dev has been transformed by Zoroaster into the Genius of Evil (whence the Christian Devil), but even the Dev is only finite; for having become possessed of the soul of man by usurpation , it will have to leave it at the great day of Retribution. The Dev obsesses the soul of the defunct for three days, during which the soul wanders about the spot at which it was forcibly separated from its body, the Ferouer ascends to the region of eternal Light.

The whole Pantheon of Heathen Deities is passed in review by him, and each is shown to have had some point of resemblance with the Trinitarian personages and Mary. There is hardly a mystery, a dogma, or a rite in the Latin Church that is not shown by the author as having been “parodied by the Curati”–the “Curved,” the Devils. All this being admitted and explained, the Symbologists ought to be silenced. And so they would be, if there were no materialistic critics to reject such omnipotency of the Devil in this world.

This evangelical plagiarism culminates in the Revelation of John, which adapts the visions of Enoch to Christianity, with modifications in which we miss the sublime simplicity of the great master of apocalyptic prediction, who prophesied in the name of the antediluvian patriarch.* In fairness to truth, the hypothesis ought at least to have been suggested, that the Book of Enoch in its present form is simply a transcript–with numerous pre-Christian and post- Christian additions and interpolations–from far older texts. Modern research went so far as to point out that Enoch is made, in Chapter lxxi, to divide the day and night into eighteen parts, and to represent the longest day in the year as consisting of twelve out of these eighteen parts, while a day of sixteen hours in length could not have occurred in Palestine. The translator, Archbishop Laurence, remarks thus: . . . the region in which the author lived must have been situated not lower than forty-five degrees north latitude, where the longest day is fifteen hours and a half, nor higher perhaps than forty-nine degrees, where"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"the longest day is precisely sixteen hours.

The Book of Enoch teaches the pre-existence of the Son of Man, the Elect One, the Messiah, who “from –––––––––– * Op. cit ., pp. xxxiv-xxxv. † Op. cit ., p. xiii. –––––––––– T HE B OOK O F E NOCH   79 the beginning existed in secret,* and whose name was invoked in the presence of the Lord of spirits, before the sun and the signs were created.” The author also refers to the “other Power who was upon Earth over the water on that day”–an apparent reference to the language of Genesis i, 2.† [ We maintain that it applies as well to the Hindu N ∼ r ∼ yana–the “mover on the waters.”] We have thus the Lord of spirits, the Elect One, and a third Power, seemingly foreshadowing the Trinity [as much as the Trim  rti] of futurity; but although Enoch’s ideal Messiah doubtless exercised an important influence on primitive conceptions of the Divinity of the Son of man, we fail to identify his obscure reference to another “Power” with the Trinitarianism of the Alexandrine school; more especially as “angels of power” abound in the visions of Enoch.‡ An Occultist would hardly fail to identify the said “Power.” The Editor concludes his remarkable reflections by adding: Thus far we learn that the Book of Enoch was published before the Christian era by some great Unknown of Semitic [?] race, who, believing himself to be inspired in a post-prophetic age, borrowed the name of an antediluvian patriarch§ to authenticate his own enthusiastic forecast of the Messianic kingdom. And as the contents of his marvellous Book enter freely into the composition of the New Testament , it follows that if the author was not an inspired prophet, who predicted the teachings of Christianity, he was a visionary enthusiast whose illusions were accepted by Evangelists and Apostles as revelation–alternative conclusions which involve the Divine or human origin of Christianity.|| The outcome of all of which is, in the words of the same Editor: . . . the discovery, that the language and ideas of alleged revelation are found in a pre-existent work, accepted by Evangelists and Apostles as inspired, but classed by modern theologians among apocryphal productions. * * This accounts also for the unwillingness of the reverend librarians of the Bodleian Library to publish the Ethiopian text of the Book of Enoch . –––––––––– * The Seventh Principle, the First Emanation [H.P.B.]"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"† Op. cit ., pp. xxxvii, and xl. ‡ Op. cit ., pp. xl-xli. § Who stands for the “Solar” or Manvantaric Year.

Thus the remark made by the Editor of the English translation, that: Chapter xcii records a series of prophecies extending from Enoch’s own time to about one thousand years beyond the present generation,* is faulty. The prophecies extend to the end of our present Race, not merely to a “thousand years” hence. Very true that: In the system of [Christian] chronology adopted, a day stands [occasionally] for hundred, and a week for seven hundred years.† But this is an arbitrary and fanciful system adopted by Christians to make Biblical chronology fit with facts or theories, and does not represent the original thought. The “days” stand for the undetermined periods of the Side-Races, and the “weeks” for the Sub-Races, the Root-Races being referred to by an expression that is not even found in the English translation. Moreover the sentence at the bottom of page 150: Subsequently, in the fourth week . . . the visions of the holy and the righteous shall be seen, the order of generation after generation shall take place, ‡ is quite wrong. It stands in the original: “the order of generation after generation had taken place on the earth,” etc.; that is, after the first human race procreated in the truly human way had sprung up in the Third Root-Races; a change which entirely alters the meaning. Then all that is given in the translation–as very likely also in the Ethiopic text, since the copies have been sorely tampered with–as about things which were to happen in the future, is, we are informed, in the past tense in the original Chaldaean MSS., and is not prophecy, but a narrative of what had already come to pass.

But here, the Seer who compiled the present Book of Enoch is distinctly shown as reading out from a book: . . .I have been born the seventh in the first week [the seventh branch, or Side-Race, of the first Sub-Race, after physical generation had begun, namely, in the third Root-Race] . . .

Verse 10th speaks of the sixth week [sixth Sub-Race of the Third Root Race] when . . . all those who are in it shall be darkened, the hearts of all of them shall be forgetful of wisdom [the divine knowledge will be dying out], and in it shall a man ascend. This “man” is taken by the interpreters, for some mysterious reasons of their own, to mean Nebuchadnezzar; he is in reality the first Hierophant of the purely human Race (after the allegorical Fall into generation) selected to perpetuate the dying Wisdom of the Devas (Angels or El ∩ h ♣ m). He is the first “Son of Man”–the mysterious appellation given to the divine Initiates of the first human school of the M ∼ nushis (men), at the very close of the Third Root-Race.

Considering that we find Enoch, or his perpetuator, mentioning the execution of the “decree upon sinners” in several different weeks,† saying that “every work of the ungodly shall disappear from the whole earth” during this fourth time (the Fourth Race), it surely can hardly apply to the one solitary Deluge of the Bible , still less to the Captivity. It follows, therefore, that as the Book of Enoch covers the five Races of the Manvantara, with a few allusions to the last two, it does not contain “Biblical prophecies,” but simply facts taken out of the Secret Books of the East. The editor, moreover, confesses that: The preceding six verses, viz ., 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th, are taken from between the 14th and 15th verses of the nineteenth chapter, where they are to be found in the MSS.‡ By this arbitrary transposition, he has made confusion still more confused.

The fact that the Apostle Jude and many of the Christian Fathers referred to it as a revelation and a sacred volume, is, however, an excellent proof that the early Christians accepted it; among these the most learned–as, for instance, Clement of Alexandria–understood Christianity and its doctrines in quite a different light from their modern successors, and viewed Christ –––––––––– * Op. cit ., Ch. xcii, 11. † Op. cit ., Ch. xcii, 7, 11, 13, 15. ‡ Op. cit ., note, p. 152. –––––––––– T HE B OOK O F E NOCH   83 under an aspect that Occultists only can appreciate.

One chapter is missing, however, in the Noachian records (from both the Paris and the Bodleian MSS.), namely, Chapter lviii, in Sect. X; this could not be remodelled, and therefore it had to disappear, disfigured fragments alone having been left of it. The dream about the cows, the black, red and white heifers, relates to the first Races, their division and disappearance. Chapter lxxxviii, in which one of the four Angels “went to the white cows and taught them a mystery,” after which, the mystery being born “became a man,” refers to ( a ) the first group evolved of primitive } ryans, ( b ) to the “mystery of the Hermaphrodite” so called, having reference to the birth of the first human Races as they are now. The well-known rite in India, one that has survived in that patriarchal country to this day, known as the passage, or rebirth through the cow–a ceremony to which those of lower castes who are desirous of becoming Br ā hmans have to s ubmit–has originated in this mystery. Let any Eastern Occultist read with careful attention the above-named chapter in the Book of Enoch , and he will find that the “Lord of the Sheep,” in whom Christians and European Mystics see Christ, is the Hierophant Victim whose name in Sanskrit we dare not give. Again, that while the Western Churchmen see Egyptians and Israelites in the “sheep and wolves,” all these animals relate in truth to the trials of the Neophyte and the mysteries of initiation, whether in India or Egypt, and to that most terrible penalty incurred by the “wolves”–those who reveal indiscriminately that which is only for the knowledge of the Elect and the “Perfect.” The Christians who, thanks to later interpolations,* have –––––––––– * Those interpolations and alterations are found in almost every case ––––––––––––––- 84   B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS made out in that chapter a triple prophecy relating to the Deluge, Moses and Jesus, are mistaken, as in reality it bears directly on the punishment and loss of Atlantis and the penalty of indiscretion.

How one who preached that the killing of animals was the greatest sin, and who was a perfect vegetarian, could die from eating pork, is a question that is never asked by our Orientalists, some of whom made [as now do many charitable missionaries in Ceylon] great fun at the alleged occurrence. The simple truth is that the said rice and pork are purely allegorical.

Not only is everything in Western religion related to measures, geometrical figures, and time-calculations, the principal period-durations being founded on most of the historical personages,* but the latter are also connected with heaven and earth truly, only with the Indo- Ā ryan heaven and earth, not with those of Palestine. T he prototypes of nearly all the biblical personages are to be sought for in the early Pantheon of India. It is the “Mind-born” Sons of Brahm ā , or rather of the Dhy ā ni-Pitara ƒ ( the “Father-Gods”), the “Sons of Light,” who have given birth to the “Sons of Earth”––the Patriarchs. For if the ¬ig-Veda and its three sister Vedas have been “milked out from fire, air and sun,” or Agni, Indra, and S™rya , as Manu-Sm \u0001 iti tells us, the Old Testament was most undeniably “milked out” of the most ingenious brains of Hebrew Kabalists, partly in Egypt and partly in Babylonia––”the seat of Sanskrit literature and Br ā hman learning from her origin,”as Colonel Vans Kenne dy truly declared.

Gaffarel has shown that the four symbolical animals on the twenty-first key of the Taro, at the third septenary, are the Teraphim of the Jews invented and worshipped by Abram’s father Terah, and used in the oracles of the Urim and Thummim. Moreover, astronomically Abraham is the sun-measure and a portion of the sun, while Enoch is the solar year, as much as are Hermes or Thoth; and Thoth, numerically, “was the equivalent of Moses, or Hermes,” “the lord of the lower realms, also esteemed as a teacher of wisdom,” the same Mason-mathematician tells us; and the Taro being, according to one of the latest bulls of the Pope, “an invention of Hell,” the same “as Masonry and Occultism,” the relation is evident. The Taro contains indeed the mystery of all such transmutations of personages into sidereal bodies and vice versa . The “wheel of Enoch” is an archaic invention, the most ancient of all, for it is found in China. Éliphas Lévi says there was not a nation but had it, its real meaning being preserved in the greatest secrecy. It was a universal heirloom. As we see, neither the Book of Enoch (his “Wheel”), nor the Zohar , nor any other kabalistic volume, contains merely Jewish wisdom. The doctrine itself being the result of whole millenniums of thought, is therefore the joint property of adepts of every nation under the sun. Nevertheless, the Zohar teaches practical Occultism more than any other work on that subject; not as it is translated though, and commented upon by its various critics, but with the secret signs on its margins.

The name itself has a very strong Kabeirian look. The words Heber, Geber (applied to Nimrod and the Giants of Genesis vi), and Kaber all sound like the mysterious word, for all the Mystery Gods were Kabeir. The Phoenicians were фοινικες or Ph’-Anakes as being of the An ā k ī m, K abeirian , kingly or divine Race, which race was the Second Race of our humanity, as shown in the Secret Books , in which all the transformations of Brahm ā throughout the ae ō ns of time are g iven.

It is but in the Third Race only that the “wheel” of Enoch was invented as a first attempt at symbology, though Enoch No. 1 had naught to do with it. There are two taros ––the wheel purely Esoteric, and the Western tarot ––Kabalistical, remodelled by Shemites, a branch so much younger than the Ā ryans and even the Hamites. T he latter taro ( tarot ) is to be read from right to left like Arabic and Hebrew writing. The former, primitive “Wheel” is in Cuneiform characters and astrological signs.

MacKenzie: One system adopts unity, another, trinity, a third quinquinity; again, we have sexagons, heptagons, novems, duodecimals, and so on, until the mind is lost in the survey of the materials alone of a science of numbers. Numbers also are related to proper proportion, and as one scale or the other is adopted in a system, so the proportion varies; and with the devarication we obtain dissimilar forms of architecture. It is impossible to deny the multiplication table, or to assert that the three angles of any triangle do not comprise two rectangles.† The Devan € gar ... characters in which Sanskrit is generally written, have all that the Hermetic, Chaldaean and Hebrew alphabets have, and in addition the Occult significance of the “eternal sound,” and the meaning given to every letter in its relation to spiritual as well as terrestrial things.

The power and potency of numbers and characters are well known to many Western Occultists as being compounded from all these systems, but are still unknown to Hindu students, if not to their Occultists. In their turn European Kabalists are generally ignorant of the alphabetical secrets of Indian Esotericism. At the same time the general reader in the West knows nothing of either; least of all how deep are the traces left by the Esoteric numeral systems of the world in the Christian Churches. Nevertheless this system of numerals solves the problem of cosmogony for whomsoever studies it, while the system of geometrical figures represents the numbers objectively. To realize the full comprehension of the Deific and the Abstruse enjoyed by the Ancients, one has to study the origin of the figurative representations of their primitive Philosophers. The Books of Hermes are the oldest repositories of numerical Symbology in Western Occultism. In them we find that the number ten * is the Mother of the Soul, Life and Light being therein united. For as the sacred anagram Teruph shows in the Book of Keys (Numbers), the number 1 (one) is born from Spirit, and the number 10 (ten) from Matter; “the unity has made the ten, the ten, the unity”; and this is only the Pantheistic axiom, in other words “God in Nature and Nature in God.” The kabalistic Gematria is arithmetical, not geometrical.

A head being added to it, the glyph (or letter) P was obtained, meaning paternity, creative potency; the R signifying the walking man (with his foot forward), going, iens, iturus . * The characters were also made supplementary to speech, every letter being at once a figure representing a sound for the ear, an idea to the mind; as, for instance, the letter F, which is a cutting sound like that of air rushing quickly through space; fury, fusee, fugue, all words expressive of, and depicting what they signify.† But the above pertains to another system, that of the primitive and philosophical"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"formation of the letters and their outward glyphic form––not to Gematria.

One can discover it in the apparent gibberish of the T ā ntrika S ™ t ras , the Kuku-ma of the Bh™t€ni and the Sikkim Dugpas and “Red-caps” of Tibet, and even in the sorcery of the N ... lgiri Mula-Kurumbas.

Otherwise the Western as much as the Eastern Dugpas might make short work of their enemies. The name of the latter is legion, for the direct descendants of the antediluvian sorcerers hate all those who are not with them, arguing that, therefore, they are against them. As for the “Little Albert”––though even this small half-esoteric volume has become a literary relic––and the “Great Albert” or the “Red Dragon,” together with the numberless old copies still in existence, the sorry remains of the mythical Mother Shiptons and the Merlins––we mean the false ones––all these are vulgarised imitations of the original works of the same names. Thus the “Petit Albert” is the disfigured imitation of the great work written in Latin by Bishop Adalbert, an Occultist of the eighth century, sentenced by the second Roman Concilium. His work was reprinted several centuries later and named Alberti Parvi Lucii Libellus de Mirabilibus Naturae Arcanis . The severities of the Roman Church have ever been spasmodic. While one learns of this condemnation, which placed the Church, as will be shown, in relation to the Seven Archangels, the Virtues or Thrones of God, in the most embarassing position for long centuries, it remains a wonder indeed, to find that the Jesuits have not destroyed the archives, with all their countless chronicles and annals, of the History of France and those of the Spanish Escurial, along with them. Both history and the chronicles of the former speak at length of the priceless talisman received by Charles the Great from a Pope. It was a little volume on Magic––or Sorcery, rather––all full of kabalistic figures, signs, mysterious sentences and invocations to the stars 106   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS and planets. These were talismans against the enemies of the King ( les ennemis de Charlemagne ), which talismans, the chronicler tells us, proved of great help, as “every one of them [the enemies] died a violent death.” The small volume, Enchiridion Leonis Papae , has disappeared and is very luckily out of print.

Anyone can see these Chaldaean, antediluvian rhombs, or revolving cylinders, covered with sacred signs; but the secrets of these divining “wheels,” or, as de Mirville calls them, “the rotating globes of Hecate,” have to be left untold for some time to come. Meanwhile there are the “turning-tables” of the modern medium for the babes, and the Kabalah for the strong. This may afford some consolation. People are very apt to use terms which they do not understand, and to pass judgments on prima facie evidence. The difference between White and Black Magic is very difficult to realize fully, as both have to be judged by their motive, upon which their ultimate, though not their immediate, effects depend, even though these may not come for years. Between the “right and the left hand [Magic] there is but a cobweb thread,” says an Eastern proverb. Let us abide by its wisdom and wait till we have learned more. We shall have to return at greater length to the relation of the Kabalah to Gupta-Vidy € , and to deal further with esoteric and numerical systems, but we must first follow the line of Adepts in post-Christian times. D UTY O F T HE T RUE O CCULTIST  107 THE DUTY OF THE TRUE OCCULTIST TOWARD RELIGIONS Having disposed of pre-Christian Initiates and their Mysteries ––though more has to be said about the latter––a few words must be given to the earliest post-Christian Adepts, irrespective of their personal beliefs and doctrines, or their subsequent places in History, whether sacred or profane. Our task is to analyse this adeptship with its abnormal thaumaturgical, or, as now called, psychological powers; to give each of such Adepts his due, by considering, firstly, what are the historical records about them that have reached us at this late day, and secondly, to examine the laws of probability with regard to the said powers. And at the outset the writer must be allowed a few words in justification of what has to be said. It would be most unfair to see in these pages, any defiance to, or disrespect for, the Christian religion––least of all, a desire to wound anyone’s feelings. The Theosophist believes in neither Divine nor Satanic miracles. At such a distance of time he can only obtain prima facie evidence and judge of it by the results claimed. There is neither Saint nor Sorcerer, Prophet nor Soothsayer for him; only Adepts, or proficients in the production of feats of a phenomenal character, to be judged by their words and deeds. The only distinction he is now able to trace depends on the results achieved––on the evidence whether they were beneficent or maleficent in their character as affecting those for or"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"against whom the powers of the Adept were used. With the division so arbitrarily made between proficients in “miraculous” doings of this or that Religion by their respective followers and advocates, the Occultist cannot and must not be concerned. The Christian whose Religion commands him to regard Peter and Paul as Saints, and divinely inspired and glorified Apostles, and to view Simon and Apollonius as Wizards and Necromancers, helped by, and serving the ends of, supposed Evil Powers––is quite justified in thus doing if he be a sincere orthodox Christian. But so also is the Occultist justified, if he would serve truth and only truth, in rejecting such a onesided view. The student of Occultism must belong to no special creed or sect, yet he is bound to show outward respect to every creed and faith, if he would become 108  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS an Adept of the Good Law. He must not be bound by the prejudged and sectarian opinions of anyone, and he has to form his own opinions and to come to his own conclusions in accordance with the rules of evidence furnished to him by the Science to which he is devoted. Thus, if the Occultist is, by way of illustration, a Buddhist, then, while regarding Gautama Buddha as the grandest of all the Adepts that lived, and the incarnation of unselfish love, boundless charity, and moral goodness, he will regard in the same light Jesus––proclaiming Him another such incarnation of every divine virtue. He will reverence the memory of the great Martyr, even while refusing to recognize in Him the incarnation on earth of the One Supreme Deity, and the “Very God of Gods” in Heaven. He will cherish the ideal man for his personal virtues, not for the claims made on his behalf by fanatical dreamers of the early ages, or by a shrewd calculating Church and Theology. He will even believe in most of the “asserted miracles,” only explaining them in accordance with the rules of his own Science and by his psychic discernment. Refusing them the term “miracle”––in the theological sense of an event “contrary to the established laws of nature” he will nevertheless view them as a deviation from the laws known (so far) to Science, quite another thing. Moreover the Occultist will, on the prima facie evidence of the Gospels ––whether proven or not––class most of such works as beneficent, divine Magic, though he will be justified in regarding such events as casting out devils into a herd of swine* as allegorical, and as pernicious to true faith in their dead-letter sense. This is the view a genuine, impartial Occultist would take. And in this respect even the fanatical Moslems who regard Jesus of Nazareth as a great Prophet, and show respect to Him, are giving a wholesome lesson in charity to Christians, who teach and accept that “religious tolerance is impious and absurd,”† and who will never refer to the prophet of Islam by any other term but that of a “false prophet.” It is on the principles of Occultism, then, that Peter and Simon, Paul and Apollonius, will now be examined.

Profane history has no record of these two, while that which the so-called sacred literature tells us of them is scattered about, contained in a few sentences in the Acts . As to the Apocrypha , their very name forbids critics to trust to them for information. The Occultists, however, claim that, one-sided and prejudiced as they may be, the apocryphal Gospels contain far more historically true events and facts than does the New Testament , the Acts included. The former are crude tradition, the latter [the official Gospels ] are an elaborately made up legend. The sacredness of the New Testament is a question of private belief and of blind faith, and while one is bound to respect the private opinion of one’s neighbor, no one is forced to share it. Who was Simon Magus, and what is known of him? One learns in the Acts simply that on account of his remarkable magical Arts he was called “the Great Power of God.” Philip is said to have baptised this Samaritan; and subsequently he is accused of having offered money to Peter and John to teach him the power of working true “miracles,” false ones, it is asserted, being of the Devil.* This is all, if we omit the words of abuse freely used against him for working “miracles” of the latter kind. Origen mentions him as having visited Rome during the reign of Nero,† and Mosheim places him among the open –––––––––– * Acts , viii, 9,10. † Adversum Celsum .

That which Irenaeus† and Epiphanius‡ say of Simon Magus––namely, that he represented himself as the incarnated trinity; that in Samaria he was the Father, in Judaea the Son, and had given himself out to the Gentiles as the Holy Spirit––is simply backbiting. Times and events change; human nature remains the same and unaltered under every sky and in every age. The charge is the result and product of the traditional and now classical odium theologicum . No Occultists––all of whom have experienced personally, more or less, the effects of theological rancor––will ever believe such things merely on the word of an Irenaeus, if, indeed, he ever wrote the words himself. Further on it is narrated"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"of Simon that he took about with him a woman whom he introduced as Helen of Troy, who had passed through a hundred reincarnations, and who, still earlier, in the beginning of ae ō ns, was Sophia, Divine Wisdom, an emanation of his o wn (Simon’s) Eternal Mind, when he (Simon) was the “father”; and finally, that by her he had “begotten the Archangels and Angels, by whom this world was created,” etc. Now we all know to what a degree of transformation and luxuriant growth any bare statement can be subjected and forced, after passing through only half a dozen hands. Moreover, all these claims may be explained and even shown to be true at bottom. Simon Magus was a Kabalist and a Mystic, who, like so many other reformers, endeavoured to found a new Religion based on the fundamental teachings of the Secret Doctrine, yet without divulging more than necessary of its mysteries. Why then should not Simon, a Mystic, deeply imbued with the fact of serial incarnations (we may leave out the number “one hundred,” as a very probable exaggeration of his disciples), speak of any one whom he knew psychically as ––––––––––––––- * Institutes of Eccles.

Do we not find in our own century some ladies and gentlemen, not charlatans but intellectual persons highly honored in society, whose inner conviction assures them that they were––one Queen Cleopatra, another one Alexander the Great, a third Joan of Arc, and who or what not? This is a matter of inner conviction, and is based on more or less familiarity with Occultism and belief in the modern theory of reincarnation. The latter differs from the one genuine doctrine of old, as will be shown, but there is no rule without its exception. As to the Magus being “one with God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost,” this again is quite reasonable, if we admit that a Mystic and Seer has a right to use allegorical language; and in this case, moreover, it is quite justified by the doctrine of Universal Unity taught in Esoteric Philosophy. Every Occultist will say the same, on (to him) scientific and logical grounds, in full accordance with the doctrine he professes. Not a Ved € ntin but says the same thing daily: he is, of course Brahman, and he is Parabrahman, once that he rejects the individuality of his personal spirit, and recognizes the Divine Ray which dwells in his Higher Self as only a reflection of the Universal Spirit. This is the echo in all times and ages of the primitive doctrine of Emanations. The first Emanation from the Unknown is the “Father,” the second the “Son,” and all and everything proceeds from the One, or that Divine Spirit which is unknowable. Hence, the assertion that by her (Sophia,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"or Minerva, the Divine Wisdom) he (Simon), when yet in the bosom of the Father, himself the Father (or the first collective Emanation), begot the Archangels––the “Son”––who were the creators of this world. The Roman Catholics themselves, driven to the wall by the irrefutable arguments of their opponents––the learned Philologists and Symbologists who pick to shreds Church dogmas and their authorities, and point out the plurality of the Elohim in the Bible–– admit today that the first “creation” of God, the Tsaba, or Archangels, must have participated in the creation of the universe. Might not we suppose: Although “God alone created the heaven and the earth” . . . that 112  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS however unconnected they (the Angels) may have been with the primordial ex nihilo creation, they may have received a mission to achieve, to continue, and to sustain it?* exclaims de Mirville, in answer to Renan, Lacour, Maury and the tutti quanti of the French Institute. With certain alterations it is precisely this which is claimed by the Secret Doctrine. In truth there is not a single doctrine preached by the many Reformers of the first and the subsequent centuries of our era, that did not base its initial teachings on this universal cosmogony. Consult Mosheim† and see what he has to say of the many “heresies” he describes. Cerinthus, the Jew, Taught that the Creator of this world . . . the Sovereign God of the Jewish people, was a Being . . . who derived his birth from the Supreme God; that this Being, moreover, Fell by degrees from his native virtue and primitive dignity. Basilides, Carpocrates and Valentinus, the Egyptian Gnostics of the second century, held the same ideas with a few variations. Basilides preached seven Ae ō ns (Hosts or A rchangels), who issued from the substance of the Supreme. Two of them, Power and Wisdom, begot the heavenly hierarchy of the first class and dignity; this emanated a second; the latter a third, and so on; each subsequent evolution being of a nature less exalted than the precedent, and each creating for itself a Heaven as a dwelling, the nature of each of these respective Heavens decreasing in splendor and purity as it approached nearer to the earth. Thus the number of these Dwellings amounted to 365; and over all presided the Supreme Unknown called Abraxas, a name which in the Greek method of numeration yields the number 365, which in its mystic and numerical meaning contains the number 355, or the man value.‡ This was a Gnostic Mystery ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"* Des Esprits , Vol. II, p. 337. † Op.

He taught two eternal principles, Good and Evil, which are simply Spirit and Matter. The seven Angels who preside over the seven Planets are the Builders of our Universe––a purely Eastern doctrine, as Saturninus was an Asiatic Gnostic. These Angels are the natural Guardians of the seven Regions of our Planetary System, one of the most powerful among these seven creating Angels of the third order being “Saturn,” the presiding genius of the Planet, and the God of the Hebrew people: namely, Jehovah, who was venerated among the Jews, and to whom they dedicated the seventh day or Sabbath, Saturday––“Saturn’s day” among the Scandinavians and also among the Hindus. Marcion, who also held the doctrine of the two opposed principles of Good and Evil, asserted that there was a third Deity between the two––one of a “mixed nature”––the God of the Jews, the Creator (with his Host) of the lower, or our, World. Though ever at war with the Evil Principle, this intermediate Being was nevertheless also opposed to the Good Principle, whose place and title he coveted. Thus Simon was only the son of his time, a religious Reformer like so many others, and an Adept among the Kabalists. The Church, to which a belief in his actual existence and great powers is a necessity––in order the better to set off the “miracle” performed by Peter and his triumph over Simon––extols unstintingly his wonderful magic feats. On the other hand, Scepticism, represented by scholars and learned critics, tries to make away with him altogether.

The Apostle of the Gentiles was brave, outspoken, sincere, and very learned; the Apostle of Circumcision, cowardly, cautious, insincere , and very ignorant. That Paul had been, partially at least, if not completely, initiated into the theurgic mysteries, admits of little doubt. His language, the phraseology so peculiar to the Greek philosophers, certain expressions used but by the Initiates, are so many sure ear-marks to that supposition. Our suspicion has been strengthened by an able article entitled “Paul and Plato,” by Dr. A. Wilder, in which the author puts forward one remarkable and, for us, very precious observation. In his Epistles to the Corinthians , he shows Paul abounding with “expressions suggested by the initiations of Sabazius and Eleusis, and the lectures of the [Greek] philosophers. He [Paul] designates himself as idi ō t ē s ––a person unskillful in the Word, but not in the gnsis or philosophical learning. ‘We speak wisdom among the perfect or initiated,’ he writes, ‘not the wisdom of this world, nor of the Archns of this world, but divine wisdom in a mystery, secret––which none of the Arch ō ns of this world knew .’”* What else can the Apostle mean by those unequivocal words, but that he himself, as belonging to the mystae (initiated), spoke of things shown and explained only in the Mysteries? The “divine wisdom in a mystery which none of the Arch ō ns of this world knew , “ has evidently some direct reference to the Basileus of the Eleusinian Initiation who did know .

But the Tannaim were Kabalists of the same secret school as John of the Apocalypse , whose careful aim it was to conceal as much as possible the real meaning of the names in the Mosaic Books. Still the calumnies so jealously disseminated against Simon Magus by the unknown authors and compilers of the Acts and other writings, could not cripple the truth to such an extent as to conceal the fact that no Christian could rival him in thaumaturgic deeds. The story told about his falling during an aerial flight, breaking both his legs and then committing suicide, is ridiculous. Posterity has heard but one side of the story. Were the disciples of Simon to have a chance, we might perhaps find that it was Peter who broke both his legs. But as against this hypothesis we know that this Apostle was too prudent ever to venture himself in Rome. On the confession of several ecclesiastical writers, no Apostle ever performed such “supernatural wonders,” but of course pious people will say this only the more proves that it was the Devil who worked through Simon. He was accused of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, only because he introduced as the “Holy Spiritus” the Mens (Intelligence) or “the Mother of all.” But we find the same expression used in the Book of Enoch , in which, in contradistinction to the “Son of Man,” he speaks of the “Son of the Woman.” In the Codex of the Nazarenes, and in the Zohar , as well as in the Books of Hermes , the same expression is used; and even in the apocryphal Evangelium of the Hebrews we read that Jesus admitted the female sex of the Holy Ghost by using the expression “My Mother, the Holy Pneuma.”* After long ages of denial, however, the actual existence of Simon Magus has been finally demonstrated, whether he was Saul, Paul or Simon.

But he adds: It contains positive facts , it seems, now warranted by the unanimous testimony of the Fathers of the Church and confirmed by the narrative of Hippolytus recently discovered.† This MS. is very far from being complimentary to the alleged founder of Western Gnosticism. While recognizing great powers in Simon, it brands him as a priest of Satan––which is quite enough to show that it was written by a Christian. It also shows that, like another servant “of the Evil One”––as Manes is called by the Church––Simon was a baptized Christian; but that both, being too well versed in the mysteries of true primitive Christianity, were persecuted for it. The secret of such persecution was then, as it is now, quite transparent to those who study the question impartially. Seeking to preserve his independence, Simon could not submit to the leadership or authority of any of the Apostles, least of all to that of either Peter or John, the fanatical author of the Apocalypse .

Prayer and contemplation added to asceticism are the best means of discipline in order to become a Theurgist, where there is no regular initiation.

Modern mediums have performed the same feat supported by a force that Spiritualists persist in calling “spirits.” But if Simon did so, it was with the help of a self-acquired blind power that heeds little the prayers and commands of rival Adepts, let alone Saints. The fact is that logic is against the supposed fall of Simon at the prayer of Peter. For had he been defeated publicly by the Apostle, his disciples would have abandoned him after such an evident sign of inferiority, and would have become orthodox Christians. But we find even the author of Philosophumena , just such a Christian, showing otherwise. Simon had lost so little credit with his pupils and the masses, that he went on daily preaching in the Roman Campania after his supposed fall from the clouds “far above the Capitolium,” in which fall he broke his legs only!

He was circumcised and commanded circumcision. But Paul said of circumcision that it availed nothing, and he (Paul) abrogated the law. Saul and Paul ––that is, Saul, under the law, and Paul, freed from the obligations of the law––were in one man, but parallelisms in the flesh , of Jesus the man under the law as observing it, who thus died in Chr ē stos and arose, freed from its obligations, in the spirit world as Christos , or the triumphant Christ. It was the Christ who was freed, but Christ was in the spirit. Saul in the flesh was the function of, and parallel of, Chr ē stos. Paul in the flesh was the function of and parallel of Jesus become Christ in the spirit, as an earthly reality to answer to and act for the apotheosis ; and so, armed with all authority in the flesh to abrogate the human law.* The real reason why Paul is shown as “abrogating the law” can be found only in India, where to this day the most ancient customs and privileges are preserved in all their purity, notwithstanding the abuse levelled at the same.

The apostle had his head shorn at Cenchreae (where Lucius Apuleius was initiated) because “he had a vow.” The Nazars ––or set apart––as we see in the Jewish Scriptures, had to cut their hair which they wore long, and which “no razor touched” at any other time, and sacrifice it on the altar of initiation. And the Nazars were a class of Chaldaean Theurgists [or Initiates].† It is shown in Isis Unveiled that Jesus belonged to this class. Paul declares that: “According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master-builder , I have laid the foundation.” ( I Corinth . iii, 10.) The expression, master-builder, used only once in the whole Bible , and by Paul, may be considered as a whole revelation. In the Mysteries, the third part of the sacred rites was called epopteia , or revelation, reception into the secrets. In substance it means [the highest stage of clairvoyance––the divine] . . . but the real significance of the word is “overseeing,” from ÐBJ@:\"4 –– “ I see myself .” [In Sanskrit the root ap had the same meaning originally, though now it is understood as meaning “to obtain.”]‡ The word epopteia is a compound one, from gB\\ –– “upon,” and ÐBJ@:\"4 ––“to look” or be an overseer, an inspector––also used for a master-builder. The title of master-mason, in Freemasonry, is derived from this, in the sense used in the Mysteries. Therefore, when Paul entitles himself a “master-builder,” he is using a word pre-eminently kabalistic, theurgic, and masonic, and one which no other apostle uses. He thus declares himself an adept , having the right to initiate others. If we search in this direction, with those sure guides, the Grecian Mysteries and the Kabalah , before us, it will be easy to find the secret reason why Paul was so persecuted and hated by Peter, John, and James.

The Petr ō ma was a pair of stone tablets used by the Hierophan ts at the Initiations, during the final Mystery. In this lies concealed the secret of the Vatican claim to the seat of Peter. As already quoted in Isis Unveiled , Vol. II, p. 92: In the Oriental countries the designation , Peter [in Phoenician and P ETER , A J EWISH K ABALIST , N OT A N I NITIATE  125 Chaldaic, an interpreter], appears to have been the title of this personage.* So far, and as the “interpreters” of Neo -Christianism, the Popes have most undeniably the right to call themselves successors to the title of Peter, but hardly the successors to, least of all the interpreters of, the doctrines of Jesus, the Christ; for there is the Oriental Church, older and far purer than the Roman hierarchy, which, having ever faithfully held to the primitive teachings of the Apostles, is known historically to have refused to follow the Latin seceders from the original Apostolic Church, though, curiously enough, she is still referred to by her Roman sister as the “Schismatic” Church.

However it may be, the word Patar, or Peter, would locate both master and disciple in the circle of initiation, and connect them with the Secret Doctrine; while in the “Seat of Peter” we can hardly help seeing a connection with Petr ō ma, the double set of stone tablets u sed by the Hierophant at the Supreme Initiation during the final Mystery, as already stated, also with the P...tha-sth€na (seat, or the place of a seat), a term used in the Mysteries of the T€ntrikas in India, in which the limbs of Sat... are scattered and then united again, as those of Osiris by Isis.‡ P...tha is a Sanskrit word, and is also used to designate the seat of the initiating Lama.

As every Kabalist knows, it embraces the whole of the Hermetic Philosophy, being a counterpart in many respects of the traditions left us of King Solomon. It reads like a fairy story, but, as in the case of the latter, sometimes facts and historical events are presented to the world under the colours of fiction. The journey to India represents in its every stage, though of course allegorically, the trials of a Neophyte, giving at the same time a geographical and topographical idea of a certain country as it is even now, if one knows where to look for it. The long discourses of Apollonius with the Br€hmans , their sage advice, and the dialogues with the Corinthian Menippus would, if interpreted, give the Esoteric Catechism. His visit to the empire of the wise men, his interview with their king Iarchas, the oracle of Amphiaraus, explain symbolically many of the secret dogmas of Hermes––in the generic sense of the name––and of Occultism. Wonderful is this to relate, and were not the statement supported by numerous calculations already made, and the secret already half-revealed, the writer would never have dared to say it. The 128  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS travels of the great Magus are correctly, though allegorically described––that is to say, all that is related by Damis had actually taken place––but the narrative is based upon the Zodiacal signs. As transliterated by Damis under the guidance of Apollonius and translated by Philostratus, it is a marvel indeed. At the conclusion of what may now be related of the wonderful Adept of Tyana our meaning will become clearer. Suffice it to say for the present that the dialogues spoken of would disclose, if correctly understood, some of the most important secrets of Nature. Éliphas Lévi points out the great resemblance which exists between King Iarchus and the fabulous Hiram, from whom Solomon procured the cedars of Lebanon and the gold of Ophir. But he keeps silent as to another resemblance of which, as a learned Kabalist, he could not be ignorant. Moreover, according to his invariable custom, he mystifies the reader more than he teaches him, divulging nothing and leading him off the right track. Like most of the historical heroes of hoary antiquity, whose lives and works strongly differ from those of commonplace humanity, Apollonius is to this day a riddle, which has, so far, found no Oedipus. His existence is surrounded with such a veil of mystery that he is often mistaken for a myth. But according to every law of logic and reason, it is quite clear that Apollonius should never be regarded in such a light. If the Tyanean Theurgist may be"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"put down as a fabulous character, then history has no right to her Caesars and Alexanders. It is quite true that this Sage, who stands unrivalled in his thaumaturgical powers to this day––on evidence historically attested––came into the arena of public life no one seems to know whence, and disappeared from it, no one seems to know whither. But the reasons for this are evident. Every means was used––especially during the fourth and fifth centuries of our era––to sweep from people’s minds the remembrance of this great and holy man. The circulation of his biographies, which were many and enthusiastic, was prevented by the Christians, and for a very good reason, as we shall see. The diary of Damis survived most miraculously, and remained alone to tell the tale. But it must not be forgotten that Justin Martyr often speaks of Apollonius, and the character and truthfulness of this good man are unimpeachable, the more in that he had A POLLONIUS O F T YANA   129 good reasons to feel bewildered. Nor can it be denied that there is hardly a Church Father of the first six centuries that left Apollonius unnoticed. Only, according to invariable Christian customs of charity, their pens were dipped as usual in the blackest ink of odium theologicum , intolerance and onesidedness. St. Jerome (Hieronymus) gives at length the story of St. John’s alleged contest with the Sage of Tyana––a competition of “miracles”––in which, of course, the truthful saint* describes in glowing colours the defeat of Apollonius, and seeks corroboration in St. John’s Apocrypha proclaimed doubtful even by the Church.† Therefore it is that nobody can say where or when Apollonius was born, and everyone is equally ignorant of the date at which, and of the place where he died. Some think he was eighty or ninety years old at the time of his death, others that he was one hundred or even one hundred and seventeen. But, whether he ended his days at Ephesus in the year 96 A.D ., as some say, or whether the event took place at Lindus in the temple of Pallas-Athene, or whether again he disappeared from the temple of Dictynna, or whether, as others maintain, he did not die at all, but when a hundred years old renewed his life by Magic, and went on working for the benefit of humanity, no one can –––––––––– * See Preface to St. Matthew’s Gospel , Baronius, Vol. I, p. 752, quoted in de Mirville, VI, 63.

[See B.C.W ., Vol. IV, pp. 238-42.] And it is also he who perverted the text in the Book of Job to enforce belief in the resurrection in flesh (see Isis Unveiled , Vol. II, pp. 181 et seq .), quoting in support the most learned authorities. † De Mirville gives the following thrilling account of the “contest.” “John, pressed, as St. Jerome tells us, by all the churches of Asia to proclaim more solemnly [in the face of the miracles of Apollonius] the divinity of Jesus Christ, after a long prayer with his disciples on the Mount of Patmos and being in ecstasy by the divine Spirit, made heard amid thunder and lightning his famous In Principio erat Verbum .

The Secret Records alone have noted his birth and subsequent career. But then–– “Who hath believed in that report?” All that history knows is that Apollonius was the enthusiastic founder of a new school of contemplation. Perhaps less metaphorical and more practical than Jesus, he nevertheless inculcated the same quintessence of spirituality, the same high moral truths. He is accused of having confined them to the higher classes of society instead of doing what Buddha and Jesus did, instead of preaching them to the poor and the afflicted. Of his reasons for acting in such an exclusive way it is impossible to judge at so late a date. But Karmic law seems to be mixed up with it. Born, as we are told, among the aristocracy, it is very likely that he desired to finish the work undone in this particular direction by his predecessor, and sought to offer “peace on earth and good will” to all men, and not alone to the outcast and the criminal. Therefore he associated with the kings and mighty ones of the age. Nevertheless, the three “miracle- workers” exhibited striking similarity of purpose. Like Jesus and like Buddha, Apollonius was the uncompromising enemy of all outward show of piety, all display of useless religious ceremonies, bigotry and hypocrisy. That his “miracles” were more wonderful, more varied, and far better attested in History than any others, is also true. Materialism denies, but evidence, and the affirmations of even the Church herself, however much he is branded by her, show this to be the fact.* The calumnies set afloat against Apollonius were as numerous as they were false. So late as eighteen centuries after his death he was defamed by Bishop Douglas in his work against miracles. In this the Right Reverend bishop crushed himself against historical facts. [For it is not in the miracles , but in the identity of ideas and doctrines preached that we have to look for a similarity between Buddha, Jesus and Apollonius.] If we study the question with a dispassionate mind, we will soon perceive that the ethics of Gautama Buddha, Plato, Apollonius, Jesus, Ammonius Saccas, and his disciples, were all based on the same mystic philosophy.

Ammonius, speaking of his philosophy, taught that their school dated from the days of Hermes, who brought his wisdom from India. It was the same mystical contemplation throughout, as that of the Yogin: the communion of the Brahman with his own luminous Self––the “ štman .”* The groundwork of the Eclectic School is thus shown to be identical with the doctrines of the Yogis––the Hindu Mystics; it is proved that it had a common origin, from the same source as the earlier Buddhism of Gautama and of his Arhats. The Ineffable Name in the search for which so many Kabalists––unacquainted with any Oriental or even European Adept––vainly consume their knowledge and lives, dwells latent in the heart of every man. This mirific name which, according to the most ancient oracles, “rushes into the infinite worlds, V6@4:ºJå FJD@NV84((4 ,”† can be obtained in a two-fold way: by regular initiation, and through the “small voice” which Elijah heard in the cave of Horeb, the mount of God. And “when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him . . .”‡ When Apollonius of Tyana desired to hear the “small voice,” he used to wrap himself up entirely in a mantle of fine wool, on which he placed both his feet, after having performed certain magnetic passes, and pronounced not the “name” but an invocation well known to every adept. Then he drew the mantle over his head and face, and his translucid or astral spirit was free. On ordinary occasions he wore wool no more than the priests of the temples. The possession of the secret combination of the “name” gave the Hierophant supreme power over every being, human or otherwise, inferior to himself in soul-strength.§ To whatever school he belonged, this fact is certain, that Apollonius of Tyana left an imperishable name behind him.

The following translation of passages in his book unveils the whole plot. The reader is asked to bear in mind that the Marquis wrote every one of his works under the auspices and authorisation of the Holy See of Rome. It would be to leave the first century incomplete and to offer an insult to the memory of St. John, to pass over in silence the name of one who had the honour of being his special antagonist, as Simon was that of St. Peter, Elymas that of Paul, etc. In the first years of the Christian era, . . . there appeared at Tyana in Cappadocia one of those extraordinary men of whom the Pythagorean School was so very lavish. As great a traveller as was his master, initiated in all the secret doctrines of India, Egypt and Chaldaea, endowed, therefore, with all the theurgic powers of the ancient Magi, he bewildered, each in its turn, all the countries which he visited and which all––we are obliged to admit––seem to have blessed his memory. We could not doubt this fact without repudiating real historical records. The details of his life are transmitted to us by a historian of the fourth century [Philostratus], himself the translator of a diary that recorded day by day the life of the philosopher, written by Damis, his disciple and intimate friend.* De Mirville admits the possibility of some exaggerations in both recorder and translator; but he “does not believe they hold a very wide space in the narrative.” Therefore, he regrets to find the Abbé Freppel “in his eloquent Essays,† –––––––––– * Des Esprit . . .

This programme was in itself sufficiently fascinating, and the travesty as sufficiently scandalous; for owing to magic arts Apollonius had succeeded in counterbalancing, in appearance , several of the miracles at Ephesus [produced by St. John], etc.* The anguis in herba has shown its head. It is the perfect, the wonderful similitude of the life of Apollonius with that of the Saviour that places the Church between Scylla and Charybdis. To deny the life and the “miracles” of the former, would amount to denying the trustworthiness of the same Apostles and patristic writers on whose evidence is built the life of Jesus himself.

It becomes interesting to learn what she says in this emergency, through her chosen speaker, de Mirville.

Nor would the Emperor Aurelian have built a temple and a shrine to that great Sage, to thank him for his apparition and communication at Tyana.

These words of charity and mercy, the noble advice put into the mouth of Apollonius (or of his sidereal phantom), as given by Vopiscus, show the Occultists who Apollonius was. Why then call him the “Medium of Satan” seventeen centuries later? There must be a reason, and a very potent reason, to justify and explain the secret of such a strong animus of the Church against one of the noblest men of his age. There is a reason for it, and we give it in the words of the author of the Key to the Hebrew - Egyptian Mystery in the Source of Measures , and of Professor Seyffarth. The latter analyzes and explains the salient dates in the life of Jesus, and thus throws light on the conclusions of the former. We quote both, blending the two. “According to solar months (of thirty days, one of the calendars in use among the Hebrews) all remarkable events of the Old Testament happened on the days of the equinoxes and the solstices; for instance, the foundations and the dedications of the temples and altars” (and consecration of the tabernacle). “On the same cardinal days, the most remarkable events of the New Testament happened; for instance, the annunciation, the birth, the resurrection of Christ, and the birth of John the Baptist. And thus we learn that all remarkable epochs of the New Testament were typically sanctified a long time before by the Old Testament, beginning at the day succeeding the end of the Creation, which was the day of the vernal equinox. During the crucifixion, on the 14th day of Nisan, Dionysius Areopagita saw, in Ethiopia, an eclipse of the sun, and he said, Now, the Lord (Jehovah) is suffering something. Then Christ arose from the dead on the 22d March, 17 Nisan , Sunday, the day of the vernal equinox [Seyf., quoting Philo, de Septen ]––that is, on Easter, or on the day when the sun gives new life to the earth. The words of John the Baptist ‘He must increase, but I must decrease,’ serve to prove, as is affirmed by the fathers of the church, that John was born on the longest day of the year, and Christ, who was six months younger, on the shortest, ––22d June and 22d December, the solstices.” This only goes to show that, as to another phase, John and Jesus were but epitomisers of the history of the same sun, under differences of aspect or condition; and one condition following another, of necessity, the statement, Luke ix, 7, was not only not an empty one, but it was true, that which “was said of some, that (in Jesus) John was risen from the dead.” (And this consideration serves to explain why it has been that the Life of Apollonius of Tyana , by Philostratus, has been so persistently kept back from translation and from popular reading. Those who have 138  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS studied it in the original have been forced to the comment that either the Life of Apollonius has been taken from the New Testament, or that the New Testament narratives have been taken from the Life of Apollonius ,"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"because of the manifest sameness of the means of construction of the narratives. The explanation is simple enough, when it is considered that the names Jesus , Hebrew :* , and Apollonius, or Apollo, are alike names of the sun in the heavens ; and necessarily the history of the one, as to his travels through the signs , with the personifications of his sufferings, triumphs, and miracles, could be but the history of the other , where there was a widespread, common method of describing those travels by personification.) It seems also that, for long afterward, all this was known to rest upon an astronomical basis; for the secular church, so to speak, was founded by Constantine, and the objective condition of the worship established was that part of his decree, in which it was affirmed that the venerable day of the sun should be the day set apart for the worship of Jesus Christ, as Sun -day. There is something weird and startling in some other facts about this matter. The prophet Daniel ( true prophet , as says Graetz),* by use of the pyramid numbers, or astrological numbers, foretold the cutting off of the Méshiac , as it happened (which would go to show the accuracy of his astronomical knowledge, if there was an eclipse of the sun at that time). . . . Now, however, the temple was destroyed in the year 71, in the month Virgo, and 71 is the Dove number, as shown, or 71 x 5 = 355, and with the fish , a Jehovah number.† “Is it possible,” queries further on the author, thus answering the intimate thought of every Christian and Occultist who reads and studies his work: Is it possible that the events of humanity do run co-ordinately with these number forms? If so, while Jesus Christ, as an astronomical figure, was true to all that has been advanced, and more, possibly, He may, as a man, have filled up, under the numbers, answers in the sea of life to predestined type. The personality of Jesus does not appear to have been destroyed, because, as a condition , He was answering to astronomical forms and relations.

But there is something more in the old literature of the early centuries. Iamblichus wrote a biography of the great Pythagoras. The latter so closely resembles the life of Jesus that it may be taken for a travesty. Diogenes Laërtius and Plutarch relate the history of Plato according to a similar style.* Why then wonder at the doubts that assail every scholar who studies all these lives?"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Church herself knew all these doubts in her early stages; and though only one of her Popes has been known publicly and openly as a Pagan, how many more were there who were too ambitious to reveal the truth? This “mystery,” for mystery indeed it is to those who, not being Initiates, fail to find the key of the perfect similitude between the lives of Pythagoras, Buddha, Apollonius, etc.-is only a natural result for those who know that all these great characters were Initiates of the same school. For them there is neither “travesty” nor “copy” of one from the other; for them they are all “originals,” only painted to represent one and the same subject: the mystic, and at the same time the public, life of the Initiates sent into the world to save portions of humanity, if they could not save the whole bulk. Hence, the same programme for all. The assumed “immaculate origin” for each, referring to their “mystic birth” during the Mystery of Initiation, and accepted literally by the multitudes, encouraged in this by the better informed but ambitious clergy. Thus, the mother of each one of them was declared a virgin, conceiving her son directly by the Holy Spirit of God; and the Sons, in consequence, were the “Sons of God,” though in truth, none of them was any more entitled to such recognition than were the rest of his brother Initiates, for they were all––so far as their mystic lives were concerned—only “the epitomisers of the –––––––––– * A.

The biographies of the external personalities bearing the names of such heroes have nothing to do with, and are quite independent of the private lives of the heroes, being only the mystic records of their public and, parallel therewith, of their inner lives, in their characters as Neophytes and Initiates. Hence, the manifest sameness of the means of construction of their respective biographies. From the beginning of Humanity the Cross, or Man, with his arms stretched out horizontally, typifying his kosmic origin, was connected with his psychic nature and with the struggles which lead to Initiation. But, if it is once shown that ( a ) every true Adept had, and still has, to pass through the seven and the twelve trials of Initiation, symbolized by the twelve labours of Hercules; ( b ) that the day of his real birth is regarded as that day when he is born into the world spiritually, his very age being counted from the hour of his second birth, which makes of him a “twice-born,” a Dvija or Initiate, on which day he is indeed born of a God and from an immaculate Mother; and ( c ) that the trials of all these personages are made to correspond with the Esoteric significance of initiatory rites––all of which corresponded to the twelve zodiacal signs––then everyone will see the meaning of the travels of all those heroes through the signs of the Sun in Heaven; and that they are in each individual case a personification of the “sufferings, triumphs and miracles” of an Adept, before and after his Initiation. When to the world at"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"large all this is explained, then also the mystery of all those lives, so closely resembling each other that the history of one seems to be the history of the other, and vice versa , will, like everything else, become plain. Take an instance. The legends––for they are all legends for exoteric purposes, whatever may be the denials in one case––of the lives of Krishna, Hercules, Pythagoras, Buddha, Jesus, Apollonius, Chaitanya. On the worldly plane, their biographies, if written by one outside the circle, would differ greatly from what we read of them in the narratives that are preserved of their mystic lives. Nevertheless, however much masked and hidden from profane gaze, the chief features of such lives will all be found there in common. Each of those characters is represented as a divinely begotten Soter (Savior), a title F ACTS U NDERLYING A DEPT B IOGRAPHIES  141 bestowed on deities, great kings and heroes; everyone of them, whether at their birth or afterwards, is searched for, and threatened with death (yet never killed) by an opposing power (the world of Matter and Illusion), whether it be called a king Kamsa, king Herod, or king M € ra (the Evil Power). They are all tempted, persecuted and finally said to have been murdered at the end of the rite of Initiation, i.e., in their physical personalities, of which they are supposed to have been rid for ever after spiritual “resurrection” or “birth.” And having thus come to an end by this supposed violent death, they all descend to the Nether World, the Pit or Hell––the Kingdom of Temptation, Lust and Matter, therefore of Darkness, whence returning, having overcome the “Chr ‘ st-condition,” they are glorified and become “Gods.” It is not in the course of their everyday life, then, that the great similarity is to be sought, but in their inner state and in the most important events of their career as religious teachers. All this is connected with, and built upon, an astronomical basis, which serves, at the same time, as a foundation for the representation of the degrees and trials of Initiation: descent into the Kingdom of Darkness and Matter, for the last time , to emerge therefrom as “Suns of Righteousness,” is the most important of these and, therefore, is found in the history of all the Soters –from Orpheus and Hercules, down to Krishna and Christ.

We fear not.

It is in Vi \u0001 vakarman, the “omnificent” who becomes (mystically) Vikartana, the “sun shorn of his beams,” who suffers for his too ardent nature, and then becomes glorified (by purification), that the keynote of the Initiation into the greatest Mystery of Nature was struck. Hence the secret of the wonderful “similarity.” All this is allegorical and mystical, and yet perfectly comprehensible and plain to any student of Eastern Occultism, even superficially acquainted with the Mysteries of Initiation. In our objective Universe of Matter and false appearances the Sun is the most fitting emblem of the life-giving, beneficent Deity. In the subjective, boundless World of Spirit and Reality the bright luminary has another and a mystical significance, which cannot be fully given to the public. The so-called “idolatrous” P€rs...s and Hindus are certainly nearer the truth in their religious reverence for the Sun, than the cold, ever-analyzing, and as ever-mistaken, public is prepared to believe at present. The Theosophists, who alone will be able to take in the meaning, may be told that the Sun is the external manifestation of the Seventh Principle of our Planetary System, while the Moon is its Fourth Principle, shining in the borrowed robes of her master, saturated with and reflecting every passionate impulse and evil desire of her grossly material body, Earth. The whole cycle of Adeptship and Initiation and all its mysteries are connected with, and subservient to, these two and the Seven Planets.

They are, one and all, the different versions of the same natural primeval Mystery, on which the Wisdom-Religion was based, and the development of its Adepts subsequently framed. And now once more we have to beg the reader not to lend an ear to the charge––against Theosophy in general and the writer in particular––of disrespect toward one of the greatest and noblest characters in the History of Adeptship––Jesus of Nazareth––nor even of hatred to the Church. The expression of truth and fact can hardly be regarded, with any approximation to justice, as blasphemy or hatred. The whole question hangs upon the solution of that one point: Was Jesus as “Son of God” and “Saviour” of Mankind, unique in the World’s annals? Was His case––among so many similar claims––the only exceptional and unprecedented one; His birth the sole supernaturally immaculate; and were all others, as maintained by the Church, but blasphemous Satanic copies and plagiarisms by anticipation? Or was He only the “son of his deeds,” a pre-eminently holy man, and a reformer, one of many, who paid with His life for the presumption of endeavouring, in the face of ignorance and despotic power, to enlighten mankind and make its burden lighter by His Ethics and Philosophy? The first necessitates a blind, all-resisting faith; the latter is suggested to every one by reason and logic. Moreover, has the Church always believed as she does now––or rather, as she pretends she does, in order to be thus justified in directing her anathema against those who disagree with her––or has she passed through the same throes of doubt, nay, of secret denial and unbelief, suppressed only by the force of ambition and love of power? The question must be answered in the affirmative as to the 144  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS second alternative. It is an irrefutable conclusion, and a natural inference based on facts known from historical records. Leaving for the present untouched the lives of many Popes and Saints that loudly belied their claims to infallibility and holiness, let the reader turn to Ecclesiastical History, the records of the growth and progress of the Christian Church (not of Christianity), and he will find the answer on those pages. Says a writer: The Church has known too well the suggestions of freethought created by enquiry, as also all those doubts that provoke her anger today; and the “sacred truths” she would promulgate have been in turn admitted and repudiated, transformed and altered, amplified and curtailed, by the dignitaries of the Church hierarchy, even as regards the most fundamental dogmas.

By His mother, according to the Evangelists, He was a man––a simple mortal man; by His Father He is God! But how? Is He then man or God, or is He both at the same time? asks the perplexed writer. Truly the propositions offered on this point of the doctrine have caused floods of ink and blood to be shed, in turn, on poor Humanity, and still the doubts are not at rest. In this, as in everything else, the wise Church Councils have contradicted themselves and changed their minds a number of times. Let us recapitulate and throw a glance at the texts offered for our inspection. This is History. The Bishop Paul of Samosata denied the divinity of Christ at the first Council of Antioch [269 A.D .]; at the very origin and birth of theological Christianity, He was called “Son of God” merely on account of His holiness and good deeds. His blood was corruptible in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. At the Council of Nicaea, held A.D . 325, Arius came out with his premisses, which nearly broke asunder the Catholic Union. Seventeen bishops defended the doctrines of Arius, who was exiled for them. Nevertheless, thirty years after, A.D . 355, at the Council of Milan, three hundred bishops signed a letter of adherence to the Arian views, notwithstanding that ten years F ACTS U NDERLYING A DEPT B IOGRAPHIES  145 earlier, A.D . 345, at a new Council of Antioch, the Eusebians had proclaimed that Jesus Christ was the Son of God and One with His Father. At the Council of Sirmium, A.D . 357, the “Son” had become no longer consubstantial. The Anomaeans, who denied that consubstantiality, and the Arians were triumphant. A year later, at the second Council of Ancyra, it was decreed that the “Son was not consubstantial but only similar to the Father in his substance.” Pope Liberius ratified the decision. During several centuries the Council fought and quarrelled, supporting the most contradictory and opposite views, the fruit of their laborious travail being the Holy Trinity, which, Minerva-like, issued forth from the theological brain, armed with all the thunders of the Church. The new mystery was ushered into the world amid some terrible strifes, in which murder and other crimes had a high hand. At the Council of Saragossa , A.D . 380, it was proclaimed that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one and the same Person, Christ’s human nature being merely an “illusion”––an echo of the Avat ā ric Hindu doctrine. “Once u pon this slippery path the Fathers had to slide down ad absurdum ––which they did not fail of doing.” How deny human nature in him who was born of a woman? The only wise remark made during one of the Councils of Constantinople came from Eutyches, who was bold enough to say: “May God preserve me from reasoning on the nature of my God”––for which he was excommunicated by Pope Flavius. At the Council of Ephesus, A.D . 449, Eutyches had his revenge.

For instance, at the first Council of Ancyra, A.D . 314, it was asked, “In baptizing a woman with child, is the unborn baby also baptized by the fact?” The Council answered in the negative; because, as was alleged, “the person thus receiving baptism must be a consenting party, which is impossible to the child in its mother’s womb.” Thus then unconsciousness is a canonical obstacle to baptism, and thus no child baptized nowadays is baptized at all in fact. And then what becomes of the tens of thousands of starving heathen babies baptized by the missionaries during famines, and otherwise surreptitiously “saved” by the too zealous Padres? Follow one after another the debates and decisions of the numberless Councils, and behold on what a jumble of contradictions the present infallible and Apostolic Church is built! And now we can see how greatly paradoxical, when taken literally, is the assertion in Genesis : “God created man in his own image.” Besides the glaring fact that it is not the Adam of dust (of Chapter ii), who is thus made in the divine image, but the Divine Androgyne (of Chapter i), or Adam-Kadmon, one can see for oneself that God––the God of the Christians at any rate––was created by man in his own image, amid the kicks, blows and murders of the early Councils. A curious fact, one that throws a flood of light on the claim that Jesus was an Initiate and a martyred Adept, is given in the work, (already so often referred to) which may be called “a mathematical revelation”–– The Source of Measures .

Because, finally, many of the Hierophants of the Mysteries, and many more of the Initiates were still living in those days, and the sentence rendered in its true words would class Jesus directly with the simple Initiates. The words “My God, my Sun, thou hast poured thy radiance upon me!” were the final words that concluded the thanksgiving prayer of the Initiate, “the Son and the glorified Elect of the Sun.” In Egypt we find to this day carvings and paintings that represent the rite.

It was a mystic sign that his spiritual birth had regenerated and united his astral soul with his divine spirit, and that he was ready to ascend in spirit to the blessed abodes of light and glory––the Eleusinia. The Tau was a magic talisman at the same time as a religious emblem. It was adopted by the Christians through the Gnostics and Kabalists, who used it largely, as their numerous gems testify, and who had the Tau (or handled cross) from the Egyptians, and the Latin Cross from the Buddhist missionaries, who brought it from India, where it can be found even now, two or three centuries B.C . The Assyrians, Egyptians, ancient Americans, Hindus, and Romans had it in various, but very slight modifications of shape. Till very late in the middle ages, it was considered a potent spell against epilepsy and demoniacal possession; and the “signet of the living God” brought down in St. John’s vision by the angel ascending from the east to “seal the servants of our God in the foreheads,” was but the same mystic Tau––the Egyptian Cross. In the painted glass of St. Denys (France), this angel is represented as stamping this sign on the forehead of the elect; the legend reads SIGNUM TA K . In King’s Gnostics , the author reminds us that “this mark is commonly borne by St. Anthony, an Egyptian recluse.”* What the real meaning of the Tau was, is explained to us by the Christian St. John, the Egyptian Hermes, and the Hindu Brahmans.

The famous Lady Ellenborough, known among the Arabs of Damascus, and in the desert, after her last marriage, as Hanoum Midjwal , had a talisman in her possession, presented to her by a Druse from Mount Lebanon. It was recognized by a certain sign on its left corner, to belong to that class of gems which is known in Palestine as a “ Messianic ” amulet, of the second or third century B.C . It is a green stone of a pentagonal form; at the bottom is engraved a fish; higher, Solomon’s Seal;‡ and still higher, the four Chaldaic letters––Yod, He, Vau, He, YAHO, which form the name of the Deity. These are arranged in quite an unusual way, running from below upward, in reversed order, and forming the Egyptian Tau. Around these there is a legend which, as the gem is not our property, we are not at liberty to give. The Tau, in its mystical sense, as well as the crux ansata , is the Tree of Life . It is well known, that the earliest Christian emblems––before it was ever attempted to represent the bodily appearance of Jesus––were the Lamb, the Good Shepherd, and the Fish .

If Humanity is to accept a so-called supernatural Religion, how far more logical to the Occultist and the Psychologist seems the transparent allegory given of Jesus by the Gnostics. They, as Occultists, and with Initiates for their Chiefs, differed only in their renderings of the story and in their symbols, and not at all in substance.

It must be confessed that the views of the Kabalists––meaning by the word those students of Occultism who study the Jewish Kabalah and who know little, if anything, of any other Esoteric literature or of its teachings––are as varied in their synthetic conclusions upon the nature of the mysteries taught even in the Zohar alone, and are as wide of the true mark, as are the dicta upon it of exact Science itself. Like the mediaeval Rosicrucian and the Alchemist––like the Abbot Trithemius, John Reuchlin, Agrippa, Paracelsus, Robert Fludd, Philalethes, etc.––by whom they swear, the continental Occultists see in the Jewish Kabalah alone the universal well of wisdom; they find in it the secret lore of nearly all the mysteries of Nature––metaphysical and divine––some of them including herein, as did Reuchlin, those of the Christian Bible . For them the Zohar is an Esoteric Thesaurus of all the mysteries of the Christian Gospel; and the S ē pher Yetz ī rah is the light that shines in every darkness, and the container of the keys to open every secret in Nature. Whether many of our modern followers of the mediaeval Kabalists have an idea of the real meaning of the symbology of their chosen Masters is another question. Most of them have probably never given even a passing thought to 168  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS the fact that the Esoteric language used by the Alchemists was their own, and that it was given out as a blind, necessitated by the dangers of the epoch they lived in, and not as the Mystery-language, used by the Pagan Initiates, which the Alchemists had re-translated and re-veiled once more. And now the situation stands thus: as the old Alchemists have not left a key to their writings, the latter have become a mystery within an older mystery. The Kabalah is interpreted and checked only by the light which mediaeval Mystics have thrown upon it, and they, in their forced Christology, had to put a theological dogmatic mask on every ancient teaching, the result being that each Mystic among our modern European and American Kabalists interprets the old symbols in his own way, and each refers his opponents to the Rosicrucian and the Alchemist of three and four hundred years ago. Mystic Christian dogma is the central maelstrom that engulfs every old Pagan symbol, and Christianity––Anti-Gnostic Christianity, the modern retort that has replaced the alembic of the Alchemists––has distilled out of all recognition the Kabalah , i. e ., the Hebrew Zohar and other rabbinical mystic works.

So many Kabalists, so many explanations. Some believe –– perchance with more reason than the rest––that the substance of the Kabalah is the basis upon which masonry is built, since modern Masonry is undeniably the dim and hazy reflection of primeval Occult Masonry, of the teaching of those divine Masons who established the Mysteries of the prehistoric and prediluvian Temples of Initiation, raised by truly superhuman Builders. Others declare that the tenets expounded in the Zohar relate merely to mysteries terrestrial and profane, having no more concern with metaphysical speculations––such as the soul, or the post-mortem life of man––than have the Mosaic books.

In other words, they maintain that the numerical language of the Kabalistic works teaches universal truths––and not any one Religion in particular. Those who make this statement are perfectly right in saying that the Mystery-language used in the Zohar and in other Kabalistic literature was once, in a time of unfathomable antiquity, the universal language of Humanity. But they become entirely wrong if to this fact they add the untenable theory that this language was invented by, or was the original property of, the Hebrews, from whom all the other nations borrowed it .

Suffice it for us to know that there was at all times a Kabalistic literature among the Jews; that though historically it can be traced only from the time of the Captivity, yet from the Pentateuch down to the Talmud the documents of that literature were ever written in a kind of Mystery-language, were, in fact, a series of symbolical records which the Jews had copied from the Egyptian and the Chaldaean Sanctuaries, only adapting them to their own national history––if history it can be called. Now that which we claim––and it is not denied even by the most prejudiced Kabalist, is that although Kabalistic lore had passed orally through long ages down to the latest pre-Christian Tannaim, and although David and Solomon may have been great Adepts in it, as is claimed, yet no one dared to write it down till the days of Shimon ben-Yo ƒ ai. In short, the lore found in Kabalistic literature was never recorded in writing before the first century of the modern era. This brings the critic to the following reflection: While in India we find the Vedas and the Br ā hmanical literature written down and edited ages bef ore the Christian era––the Orientalists themselves being obliged to concede a couple of millenniums of antiquity to the older manuscripts; while the most important allegories in Genesis are found recorded on Babylonian tiles centuries B.C .; while the Egyptian sarcophagi yearly yield proofs of the origin of the doctrines borrowed and copied by the Jews; yet the Monotheism of the Jews is exalted and thrown into the teeth of all the Pagan nations, and the so-called Christian Revelation is placed above all others, like the sun above a row of street gas lamps. Yet it is perfectly well known, having been ascertained beyond doubt or cavil, that no manuscript, whether Kabalistic, Talmudistic, or Christian, which has reached our present generation, is of earlier date than the first centuries of our era, whereas this can certainly never be said of the Egyptian papyri or the Chaldaean tiles, or even of some Eastern writings. But let us limit our present research to the Kabalah , and chiefly to the Zohar ––called also the Midrash . This book, whose T HE E ASTERN G UPTA V IDY Ā & K ABALAH  171 teachings were edited for the first time between 70 and 110 A.D ., is known to have been"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"lost, and its contents to have been scattered throughout a number of minor manuscripts, until the thirteenth century. The idea that it was the composition of Moses de León of Valladolid, in Spain, who passed it off as a pseudograph of Shimon ben- Yoƒai , is ridiculous, and was well disposed of by Munk––though he does point to more than one modern interpolation in the Zohar . At the same time it is more than certain that the present Book of Zohar was written by Moses de León, and, owing to joint editorship, is more Christian in its colouring than is many a genuine Christian volume. Munk gives the reason why, saying that it appears evident that the author “made use of ancient documents, and among these of certain Midrasch ī m , or collections of traditions and Biblical expositions, which we do not now possess.”* As a proof, also, that the knowledge of the Esoteric system taught in the Zohar came to the Jews very late indeed––at any rate, that they had so far forgotten it that the innovations and additions made by de León provoked no criticism, but were thankfully received––Munk quotes from Tholuck, a Jewish authority, the following information: H ā ya Ga ō n, who died in 1038, is to our knowledge the first a uthor who developed [and perfected] the theory of the Seph ī r ō th , and he gave to them the names which we find again among the Kabalistic names used by Dr. Jellinek. Moses ben Shem-Tob de Leon, who held intimate intercourse with the Syrian and Chaldaean Christian learned scribes, was enabled through the latter to acquire a knowledge of some of the Gnostic writings.† Again, the Sepher Yetz ī rah ( Book of Creation )––though attributed to Abraham and though very archaic as to its contents––is first mentioned in the eleventh century by Yehuda ha-Levi (in his Khozari ). And these two, the Zohar and Yetz ī rah , are the storehouse of all the subsequent Kabalistic works. Now let us see how far the Hebrew sacred canon itself is to be trusted. The word “Kabalah” comes from the root “to receive,” and has a meaning identical with the Sanskrit Smriti (“received by –––––––––– * [See B.C.W ., Vol. VIII, p. 216.] † This account is summarized from Isaac Myer’s Qabbalah , p. 10, et seq . –––––––––– 172  B LAVATSKY CO LLECTED WR ITINGS tradition”)––a system of oral teaching, passing from one generation of priests to another, as was the case with the Br ā hmanical books before they were embodied in manuscri pt. The Kabalistic tenets came to the Jews from the Chaldaeans; and if Moses knew the primitive and universal language of the Initiates, as did every Egyptian priest, and was thus acquainted with the numerical system on which it was based, he may have ––and we say he has––written Genesis and other “scrolls.” The five books that now pass current under his name, the Pentateuch , are not withal the original Mosaic Records.* Nor were they written in the old Hebrew square letters, nor even in the Samaritan characters, for both alphabets belong to a date later than that of Moses, and Hebrew––as it is now known––did not exist"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"in the days of the great lawgiver, either as a language or as an alphabet.

One of the most important differences between the Samaritan and the Hebrew text respects the duration of the period between the deluge and the birth of Abraham. The Samaritan text makes it longer by some centuries than the Hebrew text; and the Septuagint makes it longer by some centuries than the Samaritan. It is observable that in the authentic translation of the Latin Vulgate , the Roman Church follows the computation expressed in the Hebrew text; and in her Martyrology follows that of the Seventy,” both texts being inspired, as she claims. –––––––––– 174  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS As to our statement that the present Old Testament does not contain the original Books of Moses, this is proven by the facts that: (1) The Samaritans repudiated the Jewish canonical books and their “Law of Moses.” They will have neither the Psalms of David, nor the Prophets, nor the Talmud and Mishn ā h: nothing but the real Books of Moses, and in quite a different edition.* The Books of Moses and of Joshua are disfigured out of recognition by the Talmudists, they say. (2) The “black Jews” of Cochin, Southern India––who know nothing of the Babylonian Captivity or of the ten “lost tribes” (the latter a pure invention of the Rabbis), proving that these Jews must have come to India before the year 600 B.C .––have their Books of Moses which they will show to no one. And these Books and Laws differ greatly from the present scrolls. Nor are they written in the square Hebrew characters (semi-Chaldaic and semi- Palmyrene) but in the archaic letters, as we were assured by one of them––letters entirely unknown to all but themselves and a few Samaritans. (3) The Karaim Jews of the Crimea––who call themselves the descendants of the true children of Israel, i.e ., of the Sadducees––reject the Torah and the Pentateuch of the Synagogue, reject the Sabbath of the Jews (keeping Friday), will have neither the Books of the Prophets nor the Psalms ––nothing but their own Books of Moses and what they call his one and real Law. This makes it plain that the Kabalah of the Jews is but the distorted echo of the Secret Doctrine of the Chaldaeans, and that the real Kabalah is found only in the Chaldaean Book of Numbers now in the possession of some Persian S ū f ī s.

Thus, the Sabaeans (according to a tradition preserved in the S ū f ī works) say that when the “Third First Man” l eft the country adjacent to India for Babel, a tree* was given to him, then another and a third tree, whose leaves recorded the history of all the races; the “Third First Man” meant one who belonged to the Third Root-Race, and yet the Sabaeans call him Adam. The Arabs of Upper Egypt, and the Mohammedans generally, have recorded a tradition that the Angel Az ā z ē l brings a message from the Wisdom-Word of God to Ad am whenever he is reborn; this the S ū f ī s explain by adding that this book is given to every Seli- Allah (“the chosen one of God”) for his wise men. The story narrated by the Kabalists––namely, that the book given to Adam before his Fall (a book full of mysteries and signs and events which either had been, were, or were to be) was taken away by the Angel Raziel after Adam’s Fall, but again restored to him lest men might lose its wisdom and instruction; that this book was delivered by Adam to Seth, who passed it to Enoch, and the latter to Abraham, and so on in succession to the most wise of every generation––relates to all nations, and not to the Jews alone. For Berosus narrates in his turn that Xisuthros compiled a book, writing it at the command of his deity, which book was buried in Zipara† or Sippara, the City of the Sun, in Ba-bel-on-ya, and was dug up long afterwards and deposited in the temple of Belos; it is from this book that Berosus took his history of the antediluvian dynasties of Gods and Heroes.

This proves very little to our mind. It only shows that the two nations lived together for centuries, and that before adopting the Chaldaean for their phonetic tongue the Jews had adopted the old Coptic or Egyptian. The Israelitish Scriptures drew their hidden wisdom from the primeval Wisdom-Religion that was the source of other Scriptures, only it was sadly degraded by being applied to things and mysteries of this Earth, instead of to those in the higher and ever-present, though invisible, spheres. Their national history, if they can claim any autonomy before their return from the Babylonian captivity, cannot be carried back one day earlier than the time of Moses. The language of Abraham––if Zeruan (Saturn, the emblem of time ––the “Sar,” “Saros,” a “cycle”) can be said to have any language––was not Hebrew, but Chaldaic, perhaps Arabic, and still more likely some old Indian dialect. This is shown by numerous proofs, some of which we give here; and unless, indeed, to please the tenacious and stubborn believers in Bible chronology, we cripple the years of our globe to the Procrustean bed of 7,000 years, it becomes self-evident that the Hebrew cannot be called an old language, merely because Adam is supposed to have used it in the Garden of Eden. Bunsen says in Egypt’s Place in Universal History that in the Chaldean tribe immediately connected with Abraham, we find reminiscences of dates disfigured and misunderstood, as genealogies of single men, or indications of epochs. The Abrahamic tribe-recollections go back at least three millennia beyond the grandfather of Jacob.† The Bible of the Jews has ever been an Esoteric Book in its hidden meaning, but this meaning has not remained one and the same throughout since the days of Moses.

Whatever was, or was not, the Mosaic Book of Creation ––from Genesis down to the Prophets ––the Pentateuch of today is not the same. It is sufficient to read the criticisms of Erasmus, and even of Sir Isaac Newton, to see clearly that the Hebrew Scriptures had been tampered with and"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"remodelled, had been lost and rewritten, a dozen times before the days of Ezra. This Ezra himself may yet one day turn out to have been Azara, the Chaldaean priest of the Fire and Sun-God, a renegade who, through his desire of becoming a ruler, and in order to create an Ethnarchy, restored the old lost Jewish Books in his own way. It was an easy thing for one versed in the secret system of Esoteric numerals, or Symbology, to put together events from the stray books that had been preserved by various tribes, and make of them an apparently harmonious narrative of creation and of the evolution of the Judaean race. But in its hidden meaning, from Genesis to the last word of Deuteronomy , the Pentateuch is the symbolical narrative of the sexes, and is an apotheosis of Phallicism, under astronomical and physiological personations.* Its coordination, however, is only apparent; and the human hand appears at every moment, is found everywhere in the “Book of God.” Hence the Kings of Ed ō m discussed in G enesis before any king had reigned in Israel; Moses records his own death, and Aaron dies twice and is buried in two different places, to say nothing of other trifles. For the Kabalist they are trifles, for he knows that all these events are not history, but are simply the cloak designed to envelope and hide various physiological peculiarities; but for the sincere Christian, who accepts all these “dark sayings” in good faith, it matters a good deal. Solomon may very well be regarded as a myth† by the Masons, as they lose –––––––––– * As is fully shown in The Source of Measures and other works. † Surely even Masons would never claim the actual existence of Solomon? As Kenealy shows, he is not noticed by Herodotus, nor by Plato, nor by any writer of standing. It is most extraordinary, he says, “that the Jewish nation, over whom but a few years before the mighty Solomon had reigned in all his glory, with a magnificence scarcely equalled by the greatest monarchs, spending nearly eight thousand millions of gold on a temple, was overlooked by the historian Herodotus, writing of Egypt –––––––––– 178  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS nothing by it, for all their secrets are Kabalistic and allegorical ––for those few, at any rate, who understand them. For the Christian, however, to give up Solomon, the son of David–– from whom Jesus is made to descend––involves a real loss. But how even the Kabalists can claim great antiquity for the Hebrew texts of the old Biblical scrolls now possessed by the scholars is not made at all apparent. For it is certainly a fact of history, based on the confessions of the Jews themselves, and of Christians likewise, that: The Scriptures having perished in the captivity of Nabuchadrezzar, Esdras, the Levite, the priest, in the times of Artaxerxes, king of the Persians, having become inspired, in the exercise of prophecy restored again the whole of the ancient Scriptures.* One must have a strong belief in “Esdras,” and especially in his good faith, to accept the now-existing copies as genuine Mosaic Books; for:"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Assuming that the copies, or rather phonographs which had been made by Hilkiah and Esdras, and the various anonymous editors, were really true and genuine, they must have been wholly exterminated by Antiochus; and the version of the Old Testament which now subsists must have been made by Judas, or by some unknown compilers, probably from the Greek of the Seventy, long after the appearance and death of Jesus. † The Bible , therefore, as it is now (the Hebrew texts, that is), depends for its accuracy on the genuineness of the Septuagint ; this, we are again told, was written miraculously by the Seventy, in Greek, and the original copy having been lost since that time, our texts are re-translated back into Hebrew from that language. But in this vicious circle of proofs we once more have to rely upon the good faith of two Jews––Josephus and Philo Judaeus –––––––––– on the one hand, and of Babylon on the other––visiting both places, and of course passing almost necessarily within a few miles of the splendid capital of the national Jerusalem? How can this be accounted for?” he asks (p. 457). Nay, not only are there no proofs of the twelve tribes of Israel having ever existed, but Herodotus, the most accurate of historians, who was in Assyria when Ezra flourished, never mentions the Israelites at all; and Herodotus was born in 484 B.C. How is this? * Clement, Stromateis , Bk. I, chap. xii. † Book of God , p. 408. –––––––––– T HE E ASTERN G UPTA V IDY Ā & K ABALAH  179 of Alexandria––these two Historians being the only witnesses that the Septuagint was written under the circumstances narrated. And yet it is just these circumstances that are very little calculated to inspire one with confidence. For what does Josephus tell us? He says that Ptolemy Philadelphus, desiring to read the Hebrew Law in Greek, wrote to Eleazar, the highpriest of the Jews, begging him to send him six men from each of the twelve tribes , who should make a translation for him. Then follows a truly miraculous story, vouchsafed by Aristeas, of these seventy- two men from the twelve tribes of Israel, who, shut up in an island, compiled their translation in exactly seventy-two days, etc. All this is very edifying, and one might have had very little reason to doubt the story, had not the “ten lost tribes” been made to play their part in it. How could these tribes, lost between 700 and 900 B.C ., each send six men some centuries later, to satisfy the whim of Ptolemy, and to disappear once more immediately afterwards from the horizon? A miracle, verily. We are expected, nevertheless, to regard such documents as the Septuagint as containing direct divine revelation: Documents originally written in a tongue about which nobody now knows anything; written by authors that are practically mythical, and at dates as to which no one is able even to make a defensible surmise; documents of the original copies of which there does not now remain a shred.

This plea confirms the suspicions entertained by some Christian Mystics and many philosophical critics, that: ( a ) Divine Power as an Absolute Unity had never anything more to do with the Biblical Jehovah and the “Lord God” than with any other Seph ī r ō th or number. The A in-Soph of the Kabalah of Moses is as independent of any relation with the created Gods as is Parabrahman Itself. ( b ) The teachings veiled in the Old Testament under allegorical expressions are all copied from the Magical Texts of Babylonia, by Esdras and others, while the earlier Mosaic Text had its source in Egypt. A few instances known to almost all Symbologists of note, and especially to the French Egyptologists, may help to prove the statement. Furthermore, no ancient Hebrew Philosopher, Philo no more than the Sadducees, claimed, as do now the ignorant Christians, that the events in the Bible should be taken literally. Philo says most explicitly: The verbal statements are fabulous [in the Book of the Law]: it is in the allegory that we shall find the truth. Let us give a few instances, beginning with the latest narrative, the Hebrew, and thus if possible trace the allegories to their origin. 1. Whence the Creation in six days, the seventh day as day of rest, the seven El ō h ī m,* a nd the division of space into heaven –––––––––– * In the first chapter of Genesis the word “God” represents the El ō h ī m —Gods in the plural, not one God. This is a cunning and dishonest translation. For the whole Kabalah explains sufficiently that the Alhim (El ō h ī m) are seven; each creates one of the seven things enumerated in the first chapter, and these answer allegorically to the seven creations. To make this clear, count the verses in which it is said “And God saw that it was good,” and you will find that this is said seven times—in verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, and 31. And though the compilers cunningly represent the creation of man as occurring on the sixth day, yet, having made man “male –––––––––– 198  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"and earth, in the first chapter of Genesis ? The division of the vault above from the Abyss, or Chaos, below is one of the first acts of creation or rather of evolution, in every cosmogony. Hermes in Poimandr ē s speaks of a heaven seen in seven circles with seven Gods in them. We examine the Assyrian tiles and find the same on them—the seven creative Gods busy each in his own sphere. The cuneiform legends narrate how Bel prepared the seven mansions of the Gods; how heaven was separated from the earth. In the Br ā hmanical allegory everything is septenary, from the s even zones, or envelopes, of the Mundane Egg down to the seven continents, islands, seas, etc. The six days of the week and the seventh, the Sabbath, are based primarily on the seven creations of the Hindu Brahm ā , the seventh being that of man; and secondarily on t he number of generation. It is pre- eminently and most conspicuously phallic. In the Babylonian system the seventh day, or period, was that in which man and the animals were created. 2. The El ō h ī m make a woman out of Adam’s rib.* This process is f ound in the Magical Texts translated by G. Smith. The seven Spirits bring forth the woman from the loins of the man, explains Mr. Sayce in his Hibbert Lectures .† The mystery of the woman who was made from the man is repeated in every national religion, and in Scriptures far antedating the Jewish. You find it in the Avestan fragments, in the Egyptian Book of the Dead , and finally in Brahm ā , the male, separating from h imself, as a female self, V ā ch, in whom he creates Vir ā j. 3. The two Adams of the first and second chapters in Genesis –––––––––– and female in the image of God,” the Seven El ō h ī m repeat the sacramental sentence, “It was good,” for the seventh time, thus making of man the seventh creation, and showing the origin of this bit of cosmogony to be in the Hindu creations. The El ō h ī m are, of course, the seven Egyptian Khn™m™ , the “assistant- architects”; the seven Amsh ā spends of the Zoroastrians; the Seven Spirits subordinate to Ialdaba ō th of the Nazareans; the seven Praj ā patis of the Hindus, etc. * Gen . ii, 21, 22. † Op. cit .

Irenaeus also says they insisted that Moses began with the Ogdoad of the Seven Powers and their mother, Sophia (the old Kefa of Egypt, who is the Living Word at Ombos). Sophia is also Aditi with her seven sons. One might go on enumerating and tracing the Jewish “revelations” ad infinitum to their original sources; were it not that the task is superfluous, since so much is already done in that direction by others—and done thoroughly well, as in the case of Gerald Massey, who has sifted the subject to the very bottom. Hundreds of volumes, treatises, and pamphlets are being written yearly in defence of the “divine-inspiration” claim for the Bible ; but symbolical and archaeological research is coming to the rescue of truth and fact—therefore of the Esoteric Doctrine-upsetting every argument based on faith and breaking it as an idol with feet of clay. A curious and learned book, The Approaching End of the Age [p. 230], by H. Grattan Guinness, professes to solve the mysteries of the Bible chronology and to prove thereby God’s direct revelation to man.

Two pages from a small pamphlet, a lecture by Mr. Gerald Massey,† so upset the arguments and proofs of the enthusiastic Mr. Grattan Guinness, spread over 760 pages of small print, as to prevent them from ever raising their heads any more. Mr. Massey treats of the Fall, and says: Here, as before, the genesis does not begin at the beginning. There was an earlier Fall than that of the Primal Pair. In this the number of those who failed and fell was seven. We meet with those seven in Egypt—Eight with the mother—where they are called the “Children of Inertness,” who were cast out from Am- Smen, the Paradise of the Eight; also in a Babylonian legend of Creation, as the Seven Brethren, who were Seven Kings, like the Seven Kings in the Book of Revelation ; and the Seven Non-Sentient Powers, who became the Seven Rebel Angels that made war in heaven. The Seven Kronidae, described as the Seven Watchers, who in the beginning were formed in the interior of heaven. The heaven, like a vault, they extended or hollowed out; that which was not visible they raised, and that which had no exit they opened; their work of creation being exactly identical with that of the El ō h ī m in the Book of Genesis . These are the Seven elemental Powers of space, who were continued as Seven Timekeepers. It is said of them: “In watching"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"was their office, but among the stars of heaven their watch they kept not,” and their failure was the Fall. In the Book of Enoch the same Seven Watchers in heaven are stars which transgressed the commandment of God before their time arrived, for they came not in their proper season, therefore was he offended with them, and bound them until the period of the consummation of their crimes, at the end of the secret , or great year of the World, i.e ., the Period of Precession, when there was to be restoration and rebeginning. The Seven deposed constellations are seen by Enoch, looking like seven great blazing mountains overthrown—the seven mountains in Revelation , on which the Scarlet Lady sits.‡ There are seven keys to this, as to every other allegory whether in the Bible or in pagan religions.

In short, he makes it astronomical . So does the author of The Source of Measures: The celestial sphere, with the earth, was divided into twelve compartments [astronomically], and these compartments were esteemed as sexed ; the lords , or husbands , being, respectively, the planets presiding over them. This being the settled scheme, want of proper correction would bring it to pass, after a time, that error and confusion would ensue, by the compartments coming under the lordship of the wrong planets. Instead of lawful wedlock, there would be illegal intercourse, as between the planets, “sons of El ō h ī m ,” and these compartments, “daughters of H-Adam,” or of the earth -man; and, in fact, the 4th verse of 6th Genesis will bear this interpretation for the usual one, viz ., “In the same days, or periods, there were untimely births in the earth; and also behind that, when the sons of El ō h ī m came to the daughters of H-Adam, they begat to them the offspring of harlotry,” etc., astronomically indicating this confusion. * Do any of these learned explanations explain anything except a possible ingenious allegory, and a personification of the celestial bodies, by the ancient Mythologists and Priests? Carried to their last word they would undeniably explain much, and would thus furnish one of the right seven keys, fitting a great many of the Biblical puzzles yet opening none naturally and entirely, instead of being scientific and cunning master-keys. But they yet prove one thing—that neither the septiform chronology nor the septiform theogony and evolution of all things is of divine origin in the Bible. For let us see the sources at which the Bible sipped its divine inspiration with regard to the sacred number seven. Says Mr. Massey in the same lecture: The Book of Genesis tells us nothing about the nature of these El ō h ī m, erroneously rendered God, who"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"are creators of the Hebrew beginning, and who are themselves pre-extant and seated when the theatre opens and the curtain ascends. It says that in the beginning the El ō h ī m created the –––––––––– * The Source of Measures , p. 243. –––––––––– 202  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS heaven and the earth. In thousands of books the El ō h ī m have been discussed, but ... With no conclusive result. . . . The El ō h ī m are Seven in number, whether as nature-powers, gods of constellations, or planetary gods, . . . as the Pit \u0001 is and Patriarchs, Manus and Fathers of earlier times. The Gnostics, however, and the Jewish Kabalah preserve an account of the El ō h ī m of Genesis by which we are able to identify them with other forms of the seven primordial powers. . . . Their names are Ialdaba ō th, Ja ō , Tsaba ō th, Adonaios, Eloaios, Horaios, and Astaphaios. Iadaba ō th signifies the Lord God of the fathers, that is the fathers who preceded the Father; and thus the Seven are identical with the Seven Pit \u0001 is or Fathers of India (Irenaeus, B.I., xxx., 5). Moreover, the Hebrew El ō h ī m were pre-extant by name and nature as Phoenician divinities or powers. Sanchoniathon mentions them by name, and describes them as Auxiliaries of Kronos or Time. In this phase, then, the El ō h ī m are time-keepers in heaven! In the Phoenician mythology the El ō h ī m are the Seven sons of Sydik [Melchizedek], identical with the Seven Kabiri, who in Egypt are the Seven sons of Pta ƒ , and the Seven Spirits of Ra in The Book of the Dead ; . . . in America with the seven Hohgates, . . in Assyria with the seven Lumazi. . . . They are always seven in number. . . . who Kab —that is, turn round, together, whence the “Kab-iri.” . . . They are also the Ili or Gods, in Assyrian, who were seven in number! . . . They were first born of the Mother in Space,* and then the Seven Companions passed into the sphere of time as auxiliaries of Kronus, or Sons of the Male Parent. As Damascius says in his Primitive Principles , the Magi consider that space and time were the source of all; and from being powers of the air the gods were promoted to become time-keepers for men. Seven constellations were assigned to them. . . . As the seven turned around in the ark of the sphere they were designated the Seven Sailors, Companions, ¬ ishis, or El ō h ī m. The first “Seven Stars” are not planetary. They are the leading stars of seven constellations which turned round with the Great Bear in describing the circle of the year.† These the Assyrians called the seven Lumazi, or leaders of the flocks of stars, designated sheep. On the Hebrew line of descent or development, these El ō h ī m are identified for us by the Kabalists and Gnostics, who retained the hidden wisdom or gnosis, the clue of which is absolutely essential to any proper understanding of mythology or theology. . . . There were two constellations with seven stars each. We call them the Two Bears. But the seven stars of the Lesser Bear were once considered to be the seven heads of the Polar Dragon, which we meet with—as the beast with seven heads—in the Akkadian Hymns and in Revelation . The mythical dragon originated in the crocodile, which is the dragon of Egypt. . . . Now in one particular cult, –––––––––– * When they are the Anupap € dakas (Parentless) of The Secret Doctrine .

In Egypt the Great Bear was the constellation of Typhon, or Kepha , the old genetrix, called the Mother of the Revolutions; and the Dragon with seven heads was assigned to her son, Sevekh-Kronus, or Saturn, called the Dragon of Life. That is, the typical dragon or serpent with seven heads was female at first, and then the type was continued, as male in her son Sevekh, the Sevenfold Serpent, in Ea the Sevenfold, . . . Ia ō Chnubis, and others. We find these two in The Book of Revelation . One is the Scarlet Lady, the mother of mystery, the great harlot, who sat on a scarlet-coloured beast with seven heads, which is the Red Dragon of the Pole. She held in her hand the unclean things of her fornication. That means the emblems of the male and female, imaged by the Egyptians at the Polar Centre, the very uterus of creation, as was indicated by the Thigh constellation, called the Khepsh of Typhon, the old Dragon, in the northern birthplace of Time in heaven. The two revolved about the pole of heaven , or the Tree, as it was called, which was figured at the centre of the starry motion. In The Book of Enoch these two constellations are identified as Leviathan and Behemoth = Bekhmut, or the Dragon and Hippopotamus = Great Bear, and they are the primal pair that were first created in the Garden of Ē d ē n. So that the Egyptian first mother, Kefa [or Kepha] whose name signifies “mystery,” was the original of the Hebrew Chavah, our Eve; and therefore Adam is one with Sevekh the sevenfold one, the solar dragon in whom the powers of light and darkness were combined, and the sevenfold nature was shown in the seven rays worn by the Gnostic Ia ō -Chnubis, god of the number seven, who is Sevekh by name and a form of the first father as head of the Seven.* All this gives the key to the astronomical prototype of the allegory in Genesis , but it furnishes no other key to the mystery involved in the sevenfold glyph. The able Egyptologist shows also that Adam himself according to Rabbinical and Gnostic tradition, was the chief of the Seven who fell from Heaven, and he connects these with the Patriarchs, thus agreeing with the Esoteric Teaching. For by mystic permutation and the mystery of primeval rebirths and adjustment, the Seven ¬ ishis are in reality identical with the seven Praj ā patis, the fathers and creators of mankind, and also with the Kum ā ras, the f irst sons of Brahm ā , who refused to procreate and multiply. This appare nt contradiction is explained by the sevenfold nature—make it fourfold on metaphysical principles and it will come to the same thing—of the celestial men, the Dhy ā ni-Chohans. – ––––––––– * Op. cit. , pp. 123-26. –––––––––– 204  B LAVATSKY CO LLECTED WR ITINGS This nature is made to divide and separate; and while the higher principles ( Ā tma-Buddhi) of the “Creators of Men” are said to be the Spirits of the seven constellations, their middle and lower principles are connected with the earth and are shown Without desire or passion, inspired with holy wisdom, estranged from the Universe, and undesirous of progeny,* remaining Kumaric (virgin and undefiled); therefore it is said they refuse to create.

In this way the second Creation in Genesis reflects and continues the later creation in the mythos which explains it. The Fall of Adam to the lower world led to his being humanised on earth, by which process the celestial was turned into the mortal, and this, which belongs to the astronomical allegory, got literalised as the Fall of Man, or descent of the soul into matter, and the conversion of the angelic into an earthly being. . . . . It is found in the [Babylonian] texts, when Ea, the first father, is said to “grant forgiveness to the conspiring gods,” for whose “redemption did he create mankind.” (Sayce; Hib. Lec ., p. 140.) . . . The El ō h ī m, then, are the Egyptian, Akkadian, Hebrew, and Phoenician form of the universal Seven Powers, who are Seven in Egypt, Seven in Akkad, Babylon, Persia, India, Britain, and Seven among the Gnostics and Kabalists. They were the Seven fathers who preceded the Father in Heaven, because they were earlier than the individualized fatherhood on earth. . . . When the El ō h ī m said: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,” there were seven of them who represented the seven elements, powers, or souls that went to the making of the human being who came into existence before the Creator was represented anthropomorphically, or could have conferred the human likeness on the Adamic man.

This resulted in the most phallic religion of all, and has now passed, part and parcel, into Christian theology, as is proved by the lengthy quotations made from a lecture of an able Egyptologist, who can make naught of it save astronomical myths and phallicism, as is implied by his explanations of “fatherhood” in the allegories. –––––––––– * This is a Western mangling of the Indian doctrine of the Kum ā ras. † He was regarded by several Gnostic sects as one with Jehovah.

As in Sanskrit writing, the words are not separated in the Hebrew, but are made to run together—especially in the old systems. For instance, the above, divided, would read: “ B’r ā shith bara El ō h ī m eth h ā shamayim v’eth h’arets ” ; and it can be made to read thus: “B’r ā sh ithbara El ō h ī m eth hshamayim v’eth h’arets , ” thus changing the meaning entirely. The latter means, “In the beginning God made the heavens and the earth,” whereas the former, precluding the idea of any beginning, would simply read that “out of the ever-existing Essence [divine] [or out of the womb —also head-thereof] the dual [or androgyne] Force [Gods] shaped the double heaven”; the upper and the lower heaven being generally explained as heaven and earth.

For several of their saints and doctors admit that the formation of heaven and earth, of the celestial bodies, etc., belongs to the work of the “Seven Angels of the Presence.” St. Denys calls the “Builders” “the co-operators of God,” and St. Augustine goes even farther, and credits the Angels with the possession of the divine thought, the prototype, as he says, of everything created.* And, finally, St. Thomas Aquinas has a long dissertation upon this topic, calling God the primary, and the Angels the secondary, cause of all visible effects. In this, with some dogmatic differences of form, the “Angelic Doctor” approaches very nearly the Gnostic ideas. Basilides speaks of the lowest order of Angels as the Builders of our material world, and Saturninus held, as did the Sabaeans, that the Seven Angels who preside over the planets are the real creators of the world; the Kabalist-monk, Trithemius, in his De Secundis Deis , taught the same. The eternal kosmos , the Macrocosm, is divided in the Secret Doctrine like man, the Microcosm, into three Principles and four Vehicles,† which in their collectivity are the seven Principles. In the Chaldaean or Jewish Kabalah , the Kosmos is divided into seven worlds: the Original, the Intelligible, the Celestial, the Elementary, the Lesser (Astral), the Infernal (K ā ma-loka or Had ē s), and the Temporal (of man). In the – –––––––––"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" * Genesis begins with the third stage of “creation,” skipping the preliminary two. † The three root -principles are, exoterically: Man, Soul, and Spirit (meaning by “man” the intelligent personality), and esoterically: Life, Soul, and Spirit; the four vehicles are Body, Astral double, Animal (or human) Soul, and Divine Soul ( ®th™la-®ar...ra, Li‰ga-®ar...ra, K€ma-r™pa , and Buddhi, the vehicle of š tman or Spirit).

They are also the “Builders” of the Eastern Doctrine: and it is only in the third, the celestial world, that the seven planets and our solar system are built by the seven Planetary Angels, the planets becoming their visible bodies. Hence—as correctly stated—if the universe as a whole is formed out of the Eternal One Substance or Essence, it is not that everlasting Essence, the Absolute Deity, that builds it into shape; this is done by the first Rays, the Angels or Dhy ā ni-Chohans, that emanate from the One Element, which becoming periodically Light and Darkness, remains eternally, in its Root-Principle, the one unknown, yet existing Reality. A learned Western Kabalist, Mr. S. L. MacGregor Mathers, whose reasoning and conclusions will be the more above suspicion since he is untrained in Eastern Philosophy and unacquainted with its Secret Teachings, writes on the first verse of Genesis in an unpublished essay: Berash ī th Bar ā El ō h ī m —”In the beginning the El ō h ī m created!” Who are these El ō h ī m of Genesis ? Va-Yivra El ō h ī m Ath Ha-Adam Be-Tzalmo, Be-Tzelem El ō h ī m Bar ā Otho, Zakhar V’nekebah Bar ā Otham —”And the El ō h ī m created the Adam in Their own Image, in the Image of the El ō h ī m created They them, Male and Female created They them!” Who are they, the El ō h ī m? The ordinary English translation of the Bible renders the word El ō h ī m by “God:” it translates a plural noun by a singular one. The only excuse brought forward for this is the somewhat lame one that the word is certainly plural, but is not to be used in a plural sense: that it is “a plural denoting excellence.” But this is only an assumption whose value may be justly gauged by Genesis i, 26, translated in the orthodox Biblical version thus: “And God [El ō h ī m] said, ‘Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness.’ ” Here is a distinct admission of the fact that “El ō h ī m” is not a ‘plural of excellence,” but a plural noun denoting more than one being.* –––––––––– * St. Denys, the Areopagite, the supposed contemporary of St. Paul, his co-disciple, and first Bishop of St. Denis, near Paris, teaches that the bulk of the “work of creation” was performed by the “ Seven Spirits of the Presence”—God’s co-operators , owing to a participation of the divinity in them. ( Hierarch ., p. 196.) And St. Augustine also thinks that “things were rather created in the angelic minds than in Nature, that is to say, that the angels perceived and knew them (all things) in their thoughts before they could spring forth into actual existence.” ( Vid. De Genesis ad"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"–––––––––– “Z OHAR ” ON C REATION AND THE E L Ō H Ī M 211 What, then, is the proper translation of “El ō h ī m,” and to whom is it referable? “El ō h ī m” is not only a plural, but a feminine plural ! And yet the translators of the Bible have rendered it by a masculine singular ! El ō h ī m is the plural of the feminine noun Ē l-h, for the final letter, -h, marks the gender. It, however, instead of forming the plural in -oth, takes the usual termination of the masculine plural, which is -im. Although in the great majority of cases the nouns of both genders take the terminations appropriated to them respectively, there are yet many masculines which form the plural in - ō th, as well as feminine which form it in -im while some nouns of each gender take alternately both. It must be observed, however, that the termination of the plural does not affect its gender, which remains the same as in the singular. . . .. To find the real meaning of the symbolism involved in this word Elhm we must go to that key of Jewish Esoteric Doctrine, the little-known and less-understood Kabalah . There we shall find that this word represents two united masculine and feminine Potencies, co-equal and co-eternal, conjoined in everlasting union for the maintenance of the Universe—the great Father and Mother of Nature, into whom the Eternal One conforms himself before the Universe can subsist. For the teaching of the Kabalah is that before the Deity conformed himself thus— i.e ., as male and female—the Worlds of the Universe could not subsist; or in the words of Genesis , that “the earth was formless and void.” Thus, then, is the conformation of the El ō h ī m, the end of the Formless and the Void and the Darkness, for only after that conformation can the R™aƒ El ō h ī m —the “Spirit of the El ō h ī m”— vibrate upon the countenance of the Waters. But this is a very small part of the information which the Initiate can derive from the Kabalah concerning this word El ō h ī m . Attention must here be called to the confusion—if not worse —which reigns in the Western interpretations of the Kabalah . The eternal One is said to conform himself into two: the Great Father and Mother of Nature. To begin with, it is a horribly anthropomorphic conception to apply terms implying sexual distinction to the earliest and first differentiations of the One. –––––––––– Litteram I, II as summarized from De Mirville, Vol, II., pp. 337-338.) Thus the early Christian Fathers, even a non-initiate like St. Augustine, ascribed the creation of the visible world to Angels, or Secondary Powers, while St. Denys not only specifies these as the “ Seven Spirits of the Presence,” but shows them owing their power to the informing divine energy—Fohat in the Secret Doctrine. But the egotistical darkness which caused the Western races to cling so desperately to the Geo -centric System, made them also neglect and despise all those fragments of the true Religion which would have deprived them and the little globe they took for the centre of the Universe of the signal honour of having been expressly “created” by the One, Secondless, Infinite God! –––––––––– 212  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS And it is even more erroneous to identify these first differentiations—the Purusha and Prakriti of Indian Philosophy—with the El ō h ī m, the creative powers here spoken of; and to a scribe to these (to our intellects) unimaginable abstractions, the formation and"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"construction of this visible world, full of pain, sin, and sorrow. In truth, the “creation by the El ō h ī m” spoken of here is but a much later “creation,” an d the El ō h ī m, far from being s upreme, or even exalted powers in Nature, are only lower Angels. This was the teaching of the Gnostics, the most philosophical of all the early Christian Churches. They taught that the imperfections of the world were due to the imperfection of its Architects or Builders—the imperfect, and therefore inferior, Angels. The Hebrew El ō h ī m correspond to t he Praj ā patis of the Hindus, and it is shown elsewhere from the Esoteric interpretation of the Pur ā Š a s that the Praj ā patis were the fashioners of man’s material and astr al form only : that they could not give him intelligence or reason, and therefore in symbolical language they “failed to create man.” But, not to repeat what the reader can find elsewhere in this work, his attention needs only to be called to the fact that “creation” in this passage is not the Primary Creation, and that the El ō h ī m are not “ G od ,” nor even the higher Planetary Spirits, but the Architects of this visible physical planet and of man’s material body, or encasement. A fundamental doctrine of the Kabalah is that the gradual development of the Deity from negative to positive Existence is symbolized by the gradual development of the Ten Numbers of the denary scale of numeration, from the Zero, through the unity, into the plurality. This is the doctrine of the Seph ī r ō th, or Emanations. For the inward and concealed Negative Form concentrates a centre which is the primal Unity. But the unity is one and indivisible: it can neither be increased by multiplication nor decreased by division, for 1 x 1 = 1, and no more; and 1 + 1 = 1, and no less. And it is this changelessness of the Unity, or Monad, which makes it a fitting type of the One and Changeless Deity. It answers thus to the Christian idea of God the Father for as the Unity is the parent of the other numbers, so is the Deity the Father of All. The philosophical Eastern mind would never fall into the error which the connotation of these words implies. With them the “One and Changeless”—Parabrahman—the Absolute All and One, cannot be conceived as standing in any relation to things “Z OHAR ” ON C REATION AND THE E L Ō H Ī M 213 finite and conditioned, and hence they would never use such terms as these, which in their very essence imply such a relation. Do they, then, absolutely sever man from God? On the contrary. They feel a closer union than the Western mind has done in calling God the “Father of All,” for they know that in his immortal essence man is himself the Changeless, Secondless One. But we have just said that the Unity is one and changeless by either multiplication or division; how then is two, the Duad, formed? By reflection. For, unlike Zero, the Unity is partly definable—that is, in its positive aspect; and the definition creates an Eikon or Eid ō lon of itself which, together with itself, forms a Duad; and thus the number two is to a certain extent analogous to the Christian idea of the Son as the Second Person. And as the Monad vibrates, and recoils into the Darkness of the Primary Thought, so is the Duad left as its vice-gerent and representative, and thus co-equal with the Positive Duad is the Triune Idea, the number three, co-equal and co-eternal with the Duad in the bosom of the Unity, yet, as it were, proceeding therefrom in the numerical conception of its sequence ."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" This explanation would seem to imply that Mr. Mathers is aware that this “creation” is not the truly divine or primary one, since the Monad—the first manifestation on our plane of objectivity—”recoils into the Darkness of the Primal Thought,” i.e ., into the subjectivity of the first divine Creation. And this, again, also partly answers to the Christian idea of the Holy Ghost, and of the whole three forming a Trinity in unity. This also explains the fact in geometry of the three right lines being the smallest number which will make a plane rectilineal figure, while two can never enclose a space, being powerless and without effect till completed by the number Three. These three first numbers of the decimal scale the Qabalists call by the names of Kether, the Crown, ž okm ā h, Wisdom, and B ī n ā h, Understanding; and they furthermore associate with them these divine names: with the Unity, Ehey ē h, “I exist;” with the Duad, Yah; and with the Triad, El ō h ī m; they especially also call the Duad, Abb ā —the Father, and the Triad, Aima—the Mother, whose eternal conjunction is symbolized in the word El ō h ī m. But what especially strikes the student of the Kabalah is the malicious persistency with which the translators of the Bible have jealously crowded out of sight and suppressed every reference to the feminine form of the Deity. They have, as we have just seen, translated the feminine plural “El ō h ī m,” by the masculine singular, “God.” But they have done more than this: they have carefully hidden the fact that the word R™aƒ —the “Spirit”—is feminine, and that consequently the Holy Ghost of the New 214  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Testament is a feminine Potency. How many Christians are cognizant of the fact that in the account of the Incarnation in Luke (i. 35) two divine Potencies are mentioned? “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the Power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.” The Holy Ghost (the feminine Potency) descends, and the Power of the Highest (the masculine Potency) is united therewith. “Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God”—of the El ō h ī m namely, seeing that these two Potencies descend. In the S ē pher Yetz ī rah , or Book of Formation , we read: “One is She the R ū a ƒ El ō h ī m Hayim—(Spirit of the Living El ō h ī m) . . . . Voice, Spirit, and Word; and this is She, the Spirit of the Holy One.” Here again we see the intimate connection which exists between the Holy Spirit and the El ō h ī m. Furthermore, farther on in this same Book of Formation —which is, be it remembered, one of the oldest of the Kabalistical Books, and whose authorship is ascribed to Abraham the Patriarch—we shall find the idea of a Feminine Trinity in the first place, from whom a masculine Trinity proceeds; or as it is said in the text: “Three Mothers whence proceed three Fathers.” And yet this double Triad forms, as it were, but one complete Trinity. Again it is worthy of note that the Second and Third Seph ī r ō th (Wisdom and Understanding) are both distinguished by feminine names, ž okmah and B ī n ā h, notwithstanding that to the former more particularly the masculine idea, and to the latter the feminine, are attributed; under the titles of Abb ā and Aima (or Father and Mother). This Aima (the Great Mother) is magnificently symbolized in the twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse , which is undoubtedly one of the most Kabalistical books in the Bible . In fact, without the Kabalistical keys its meaning is utterly unintelligible. Now, in the Hebrew, as in the Greek, alphabet, there are no distinct numeral characters, and consequently each letter has a certain numerical value attached to it. From this circumstance results the important fact that every Hebrew word constitutes a number, and every number a word. This is referred to in the Revelations (xiii, 18) in mentioning the “number of the beast”! In the Kabalah words of equal numerical values are supposed to have a certain explanatory connection with each other. This forms the science of Gematria, which is the first divison of the Literal Kabalah . Furthermore, each letter of the Hebrew alphabet had for the Initiates of the Kabalah a certain hieroglypical value and meaning which, rightly applied, gave to each word the value of a mystical sentence; and this again was variable according to the relative positions of the letters with regard to each other. From these various Kabalistical points of view let us now examine this word El ō h ī m."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" First then we can divide the word into the two words, which signify “The Feminine Divinity of the Waters;” compare with the Greek Aphrodite, “sprung from the foam of the sea.” Again it is divisible into the “Mighty One, Star of the Sea,” or “the Mighty One breathing forth the Spirit upon the Waters.” Also by combination of the letters we get “the Silent Power of Y ā h.” And again, “My God, the Former of the Universe,” “Z OHAR !” ON C REATION AND THE E L Ō H Ī M 215 for Mah is a secret Kabalistical name applied to the idea of Formation. Also we obtain “Who is my God.” Furthermore “the Mother in Y ā h.” The total number is 1 + 30 + 5 + 10 + 40 = 86 = “Violent heat,” or “the Power of Fire.” If we add together the three middle letters we obtain 45, and the first and last letters yield 41, making thus “the Mother of Formation.” Lastly, we shall find the two divine names “ Ē l” and “Y ā h,” together with the latter m , which signifies “Water,” for Mem, the name of this letter, means “water.” If we divide it into its component letters and take them as hieroglyphical signs we shall have: “Will perfected through Sacrifice progressing through successive Transformation by Inspiration.” The last few paragraphs of the above, in which the word “El ō h ī m” is Kabalistically a nalyzed, show conclusively enough that the El ō h ī m are not one, nor two, nor even a t rinity, but a Host—the army of the creative powers. The Christian Church, in making of Jehovah—one of these very El ō h ī m —the one S upreme God, has introduced hopeless confusion into the celestial hierarchy, in spite of the volumes written by Thomas Aquinas and his school on the subject. The only explanation to be found in all their treatises on the nature and essence of the numberless classes of celestial beings mentioned in the Bible —Archangels, Thrones, Seraphim, Cherubim, Messengers, etc.—is that “The angelic host is God’s militia.” They are “Gods the creatures ,” while he is “God the Creator ”; but of their true functions—of their actual place in the economy of Nature—not one word is said. They are . . . more brilliant than the flames, more rapid than the wind, and they live in love and harmony, mutually enlightening each other, feeding on bread and a mystic beverage—[the communion wine and water?]—surrounding as with a river of fire the throne of the Lamb, and veiling their faces with their wings. This throne of love and glory they leave only to carry to the stars, the earth, the kingdoms, the cities, and all the sons of God , their brothers and pupils, in short, to all creatures, the divine influence. . . . As to their number, it is that of the great army of Heaven (Saba ō th), more numerous than the stars. . . . Theology ... shows us “these rational luminaries,” each constituting a species, and containing in their virtue such or another portion of Nature: covering immense space, though of a determined extent , residing—incorporeal though they are—within circumscribed limits; . . . more rapid than light or thunderbolt, disposing of all the elements of Nature, producing at will inexplicable mirages [illusions?], objective and subjective in turn, speaking to men a 216  B LAVATSKY CO LLECTED WR ITINGS language at one time articulate, at another purely spiritual.*"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" We learn farther on in the same work that it is these Angels and their hosts who are referred to in the sentence of verse 1, chapter ii of Genesis : “ Igitur perfecti sunt coeli et terra, et omnis ornatus eorum :” and that the Vulgate has peremptorily substituted for the Hebrew word “tsaba” (“host”) that of “ornament”; Munk shows the mistake of substitution and the derivation of the compound title, “Tsaba ō th-El ō h ī m,” from “tsaba.” Moreover, C ornelius ? Lapide, “the master of all Biblical commentators,” says de Mirville, shows us that such was the real meaning. Those Angels are stars. All this, however, teaches us very little as to the true functions of this celestial army, and nothing at all as to its place in evolution and its relation to the earth we live on. For an answer to the question, “Who are the true Creators?” we must go to the Esoteric Doctrine, since there only can the key be found which will render intelligible the Theogonies of the various world-religions. There we find that the real creator of the Kosmos, as of all visible Nature—if not of all the invisible hosts of Spirits not yet drawn into the “Cycle of Necessity,” or evolution—is “the Lord—the Gods,” or the “Working Host,” the “Army” collectively taken, the “One in many.” The One is infinite and unconditioned. It cannot create, for It can have no relation to the finite and conditioned. If everything we see, from the glorious suns and planets down to the blades of grass and the specks of dust, had been created by the Absolute Perfection and were the direct work of even the First Energy that proceeded from It,† then every such thing –––––––––– * De Mirville, Des Esprits , Vol. II, pp. 294-95. † To the Occultist and Chela the difference made between Energy and Emanation need not be explained. The Sanskrit word “ ® akti” is untranslatable. It may be Energy, but it is one that proceeds through itself, not being due to the active or conscious will of the one that produces it. The “First-Born,” or Logos, is not an Emanation, but an Energy inherent in and co-eternal with Parabrahman, the One. The Zohar speaks of emanations, but reserves the word for the seven Seph ī r ō th emanated from the first three—which form one triad—Kether, žokm€h , and B...n€h . As for these three, it explains the difference by calling them “immanations,” something inherent to and coeval with the subject postulated, or in other –––––––––– “Z OHAR ” ON C REATION AND THE E L Ō H Ī M 217 would have been perfect, eternal, and unconditioned like its author.

In short, these imperfect works are the unfinished production of evolution, under the guidance of the imperfect Gods. The Zohar gives us this assurance as well as the Secret Doctrine. It speaks of the auxiliaries of the “Ancient of Days,” the “Sacred Aged,” and calls them ophanim, or the living Wheels of the celestial orbs, who participate in the work of the creation of the Universe.

This imperfection is one of the arguments of the Secret Science in favour of the existence and activity of these “Powers.” And who know better than the few philosophers of our civilized lands how near the truth Philo was in ascribing the origin of evil to the admixture of inferior potencies in the arrangement of matter, and even in the formation of man—a task entrusted to the divine Logos. * Psalms cxxxv, 5. –––––––––– 218  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS And again: For all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord made the heavens.* The Egyptian Neteru, translated by Champollion “ the other Gods ,” are the El ō h ī m of t he Biblical writers, behind which stands concealed the One God, considered in the diversity of his powers.† This One is not Parabrahman, but the Unmanifested Logos; the Demiourgos, the real Creator or Fashioner, that follows him, standing for the Demiourgi collectively taken. Further on the great Egyptologist adds: We see Egypt concealing and hiding, so to say, the God of Gods behind the agents she surrounds him with; she gives the precedence to her great gods before the one and sole Deity, so that the attributes of that God become their property.

A very learned Rabbi, now the Chevalier Drach, having been converted to Roman Catholicism, and being a great Hebraist, thought fit to step into the shoes of Pico della Mirandola and John Reuchlin, and to assure his new co-religionists that the Zohar contained in it pretty nearly all the dogmas of Catholicism. It is not our province to show here how far he has succeeded or failed; only to bring one instance of his explanations and preface it with the following: The Zohar , as already shown, is not a genuine production of the Hebrew mind. It is the repository and compendium of the oldest doctrines of the East, transmitted orally at first, and then written down in independent treatises during the Captivity at Babylon, and finally brought together by Rabbi Shimon ben Yoƒai , toward the beginning of the Christian era. As Mosaic cosmogony was born under a new form in Mesopotamian countries, so the Zohar was a vehicle in which were focussed rays from the light of Universal Wisdom. Whatever likenesses are found between it and the Christian teachings, the compilers of the Zohar never had Christ in their minds. Were it otherwise, there would not be one single Jew of the Mosaic law left in the world by this time. Again, if one is to accept literally what the Zohar says, then any religion under the sun may find corroboration in its symbols and allegorical sayings; and this, simply because this work is the echo of the primitive truths, and every creed is founded on some of these; the Zohar being but a veil of the Secret Doctrine. This is so evident that we have only to point to the said ex-Rabbi, the Chevalier Drach, to prove the fact. In Part III, fol. 87 (col. 346th) the Zohar treats of the Spirit guiding the Sun, its Rector, explaining that it is not the Sun itself that is meant thereby, but the Spirit “on, or under ” the Sun. Drach is anxious to show that it was Christ who was meant by that “Sun,” or the Solar Spirit therein. In his comment upon that passage which refers to the Solar Spirit as “that stone which the builders rejected,” [ Ps . 118, 22] he asserts most positively that this W HAT O CCULTISTS & K ABALISTS H AVE T O S AY 221 Sun-stone ( pierre soleil ) is identical with Christ, who was that stone, and that therefore"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" The sun is undeniably ( sans contredit ) the second hypostasis of the Deity,* or Christ.

The Initiates alone could give a philosophical explanation of this, and a reason for it— its mysticism notwithstanding—were only the world ready to receive it, which, alas! it is not. The last of the Solar Priests in Europe was the Imperial Initiate, Julian, now called the Apostate.* He tried to benefit the world"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"–––––––––– * Julian died for the same crime as Socrates. Both divulged a portion of the solar mystery, the heliocentric system being only a part of what was given during Initiation—one consciously, the other unconsciously, the Greek Sage never having been initiated. It was not the real solar system that was preserved in such secrecy, but the mysteries connected with the Sun’s constitution. Socrates was sentenced to death by earthly and worldly judges; Julian died a violent death because the hitherto protecting hand was withdrawn from him, and, no longer shielded by it, he was simply left to his destiny or Karma. For the student of Occultism there is a suggestive difference between the two kinds of death. Another memorable instance of the unconscious divulging of secrets pertaining to mysteries is that of the poet, P. Ovidius Naso, who, like Socrates, had not been initiated. In his case, the Emperor Augustus, who was an Initiate, mercifully changed the penalty of death into banishment to Tomos on the Euxine. This sudden change from unbounded royal favour to banishment has been a fruitful scheme of speculation to classical scholars not initiated into the Mysteries. They have quoted Ovid’s own lines to show that it was some great and heinous immorality of the Emperor of which Ovid had become unwillingly cognizant. The inexorable law of the death penalty always following upon the revelation of any portion of the Mysteries to the profane, was unknown to them. Instead of seeing the amiable and merciful act of the Emperor in its true light, they have made it an occasion for traducing his moral character. The poet’s own words can be no evidence, because as he was not an Initiate, it could not be explained to him in what his offence consisted. There have been comparatively modern instances of poets unconsciously revealing in their verses so much of the hidden knowledge as to make even Initiates suppose them to be fellow-Initiates, and come to talk to them on the subject.

The pure energy of solar intelligence proceeds from the luminous seat occupied by our Sun in the centre of heaven, that pure energy being the Logos of our system; the “Mysterious Word-Spirit produces all through the Sun, and never operates through any other medium,” says Hermes Trismegistus. “For it is in the Sun, more than in any other heavenly body that the [unknown] Power placed the seat of its habitation.”† Only neither Hermes Trismegistus nor Julian, an initiated Occultist, nor any other, meant by this Unknown Cause Jehovah, or Jupiter.

As the author, being an ex-Rabbi, thoroughly versed in Hebrew, and in the mysteries of the Zohar , ought to know the value of words; and as, moreover, in writing this, he was bent upon reconciling “the seeming contradictions,” as he puts it, between Judaism and Christianity —the fact becomes quite evident. But all this pertains to questions and problems which will be solved naturally and in the course of the development of the doctrine. The Roman Catholic Church stands accused, not of worshipping under other names the Divine Beings worshipped by all nations in Antiquity, but of declaring idolatrous, not only the Pagans ancient and modern, but every Christian nation that has freed itself from the Roman yoke. The accusation brought against herself by more than one man of Science, of worshipping the stars like true Sabaeans of old, stands to this day uncontradicted, yet no star-worshipper has ever addressed his adoration to the material stars and planets, as will be shown before the last page of this work is written; none the less is it true that those Philosophers alone who studied Astrology and Magic knew that the last word of those sciences was to be sought in, and expected from, the Occult forces emanating from those constellations.

The “Seven Planetary Spirits” may be ridiculed by Scientists to their hearts’ content, yet the need of intelligent ruling and guiding Forces is so much felt to this day that scientific men and specialists, who will not hear of Occultism or of ancient systems, find themselves obliged to generate in their inner consciousness some kind of semi-mystical system. Metcalfe’s “sunforce” theory, and that of Zaliwsky, a learned Pole, which made Electricity the Universal Force and placed its storehouse in the Sun,* were revivals of the Kabalistic teachings. Zaliwsky tried to prove that Electricity, producing “the most powerful, attractive, calorific, and luminous effects,” was present in the physical constitution of the Sun and explained its peculiarities. This is very near the Occult teaching. It is only by admitting the gaseous nature of the Sun-reflector, and the powerful Magnetism and Electricity of the solar attraction and repulsion, that one can explain ( a ) the evident absence of any waste of power and luminosity in the Sun—inexplicable by the ordinary laws of combustion; and ( b ) the behaviour of the planets, so often contradicting every accepted rule of weight and gravity. And Zaliwsky makes this “solar electricity” “ differ from anything known on earth .” Father Secchi may be suspected of having sought to introduce Forces of quite a new order and quite foreign to gravitation, which he had discovered in Space.† in order to reconcile Astronomy with theological Astronomy.

The concept is rather hazy, but is evidently on the Occult lines. Moreover, the system proposed is entirely pantheistic, and is worked out in a purely scientific volume. Monotheists and Roman Catholics fall foul of it, of course; but one who believes in the Planetary Spirits and who endows Nature with living Intelligences, must always expect this. In this connection, however, it is curious that after the moderns have so laughed at the ignorance of the ancients, Who, knowing only of seven planets [yet having an ogdoad which did not include the earth!], invented therefore seven Spirits to fit in with the number, Babinet should have vindicated the “superstition” unconsciously –––––––––– * Mémoire sur le système solaire , p. 7, in de Mirville , op. cit ., IV, 157. † Éssai sur l’identité des agents producteurs du son, de la lumière , etc., p. 15, in de Mirville, ibid . ‡ De Mirville, op. cit., IV, 158. –––––––––– KABALISTS IN SCIENCE & OCCULT ASTRONOMY 227 to himself.

Neptune’s heat and light are reduced to 1/900 part of the heat and light received by the earth. His motion and that of his satellites have always looked suspicious. They do not agree—in appearance, at least—with those of the other planets. His system is retrograde, etc. But even the latter abnormal fact resulted only in the creation of new hypotheses by our Astronomers, who forthwith suggested a probable overturn of Neptune, his collision with another body, etc. Was Adams’ and Leverrier’s discovery so welcomed because Neptune was as necessary as was Ether to throw a new glory upon astronomical prevision, upon the certitude of modern scientific data, and principally upon the power of mathematical analysis? It would so appear. –––––––––– * In de Mirville, op. cit ., IV, 139. [Mr. W.

Yet, as in the case of terrestrial annexation, scientific authority may be proved “right” only because it has “might.” Neptune’s motion happens to be dimly perceived: Eureka! it is a planet! A mere motion, however, proves very little. It is now an ascertained fact in Astronomy that there are no absolutely fixed stars in Nature,* even though such stars should continue to exist in astronomical parlance, while they have passed from the scientific imagination. Occultism, however, has a strange theory of its own with regard to Neptune. Occultism says that if several hypotheses resting on mere assumption—which have been accepted only because they have been taught by eminent men of learning—are taken away from the Science of Modern Astronomy, to which they serve as props, then even the presumably universal law of gravitation will be found to be contrary to the most ordinary truths of mechanics. And really one can hardly blame Christians—foremost of all the Roman Catholics—however scientific some of these may themselves be, for refusing to quarrel with their Church for the sake of scientific beliefs. Nor can we even blame them for accepting in the secresy of their hearts—as some of them do—the theological “Virtues” and “Arch ō ns” of Darkness, instead of all the blind forces off ered them by Science.

As the fixed star nearest to the sun, however, is eight-thousand times farther away from him than is Neptune, the illusions furnished by the telescopes must be also eight-thousand times as great. We will therefore leave the question at rest, repeating only what A. Maury said in his work ( La Terre et l’Homme , published in 1858): “It is utterly impossible, so far, to decide anything concerning Neptune’s constitution, analogy alone authorizing us to ascribe to him a rotary motion like that of other planets.” (in de Mirville, op. cit ., IV, 140.) –––––––––– KABALISTS IN SCIENCE & OCCULT ASTRONOMY 229 sidereal worlds and globes eternally faithful to their primitive orbits; never wandering beyond their respective paths. Nor is there any intervention needed, as it could only be disastrous. Whether the first sidereal incipient rotation took place owing to an intercosmic chance, or to the spontaneous development of latent primordial forces; or again, whether that impulse was given once for all by God or Gods—it does not make the slightest difference. At this stage of cosmic evolution no intervention, superior or inferior, is admissible. Were any to take place, the universal clock-work would stop, and Kosmos would fall into pieces. Such are stray sentences, pearls of wisdom, fallen from time to time from scientific lips, and now chosen at random to illustrate a query. We lift our diminished heads and look heavenward. Such seems to be the fact: worlds, suns, and stars, the shining myriads of the heavenly hosts, remind the Poet of an infinite, shoreless ocean, whereon move swiftly numberless squadrons of ships, millions upon millions of cruisers, large and small, crossing each other, whirling and gyrating in every direction; and Science teaches us, that though they be without rudder or compass or any beacon to guide them, they are nevertheless secure from collision—almost secure, at any rate, save in chance accidents—as the whole celestial machine is built upon and guided by an immutable, albeit blind, law, and by constant and accelerating force or forces. “Built upon” by whom? “By self-evolution,” is the answer. Moreover, as dynamics teach that A body in motion tends to continue in the same state of relative rest or motion unless acted upon by some external force, this force has to be regarded as self-generated—even if not eternal, since this would amount to the recognition of perpetual motion—and so well self-calculated and self-adjusted as to last from the beginning to the end of Kosmos. But “self-generation” has still to generate from something, generation ex nihilo being as contrary to reason as it is to Science. Thus we are placed once more between the horns of a dilemma: are we to believe in perpetual motion or in self-generation ex nihilo ? And if in neither, who or what is that something, which first produced that force or those forces? There are such things in mechanics as superior levers, which give the impulse and act upon secondary or inferior levers. The former, however, need an impulse and occasional renovation, 230  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"otherwise they would themselves very soon stop and fall back into their original status. What is the external force which puts and retains them in motion? Another dilemma! As to the law of cosmical non-intervention , it could be justified only in one case, namely, if the celestial mechanism were perfect; but it is not. The so-called unalterable motions of celestial bodies alter and change incessantly; they are very often disturbed, and the wheels of even the sidereal locomotive itself occasionally jump off their invisible rails, as may be easily proved. Otherwise why should Laplace speak of the probable occurrence at some future time of an out-and-out reform in the arrangement of the planets;* or Lagrange maintain the gradual narrowing of the orbits; or our modern Astronomers, again, declare that the fuel in the sun is slowly disappearing? If the laws and forces which govern the behaviour of the celestial bodies are immutable, such modifications and wearing-out of substance or fuel, of force and fluids, would be impossible; yet they are not denied. Therefore one has to suppose that such modifications will have to rely upon the laws of forces, which will have to self-regenerate themselves once more on such occasions, thus producing an astral antinomy, and a kind of physical palinomy, since, as Laplace says, one would then see fluids disobeying themselves and reacting in a way contrary to all their attributes and properties.† Newton felt very uncomfortable about the moon. Her behaviour in progressively narrowing the circumference of her orbit around the earth made him nervous, lest it should end one day in our satellite falling upon the earth.

We may be answered that the personal beliefs of some pious Astronomers, however great they may be as scientific characters, are no proofs of the actual existence and presence in space of intelligent supramundane Beings, of either Gods or Angels. It is the behaviour of the stars and planets themselves that has to be analysed and inferences must be drawn therefrom. Renan asserts that nothing that we know of the sidereal bodies warrants the idea of the presence of any Intelligence, whether internal or external to them. Let us see, says Reynaud, if this is a fact, or only one more empty scientific assumption. The orbits traversed by the planets are far from being immutable. They are, on the contrary, subject to"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"perpetual mutation in position, as in form.

This assertion will be easily demonstrated by giving a few instances, instituting comparisons between the two interpretations of one and the same doctrine—the Hermetic Universal Doctrine. It is the more needed since, were we to neglect bringing forward such comparisons, our work would be left incomplete. We may take the late Éliphas Lévi, rightly referred to by another Western Mystic, Mr. Kenneth MacKenzie, as “one of the greatest representatives of modern Occult Philosophy,”* as presumably the best and most learned expounder of the Chaldaean Kabalah , and compare his teaching with that of Eastern Occultists. In his unpublished manuscripts and letters, lent to us by a Theosophist, who was for fifteen years his pupil, we had hoped to find that which he was unwilling to publish. What we do find, however, disappoints us greatly. We will take these teachings, then, as containing the essence of Western or Kabalistic Occultism, analyzing and comparing them with the Eastern interpretation as we go on. Éliphas Lévi teaches correctly, though in language rather too rhapsodically rhetorical to be sufficiently clear to the beginner, that Eternal life is Motion equilibrated by the alternate manifestations of force."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" But why does he not add that this perpetual motion is independent of the manifested Forces at work? He says: Chaos is the Tohu-vah-bohu of perpetual motion and the sum total of primordial matter; and he fails to add that Matter is “primordial” only at the beginning of every new reconstruction of the Universe: matter in abscondito , as it is called by the Alchemists, is eternal, –––––––––– * See The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia , article: “Yetz ē rah, Sepher.” –––––––––– 234  BLAVATSKY COLLECTED WRITINGS indestructible, without beginning or end. It is regarded by Eastern Occultists as the eternal Root of all, the M ū laprakriti of the Ved ā ntin, and the Svabhavat of the Buddhist; the D ivine Essence, in short, or Substance; the radiations from This are periodically aggregated into graduated forms, from pure Spirit to gross Matter; the Root, or Space, is in its abstract presence the Deity Itself, the Ineffable and Unknown One Cause. Ain Soph with him also is the Boundless, the infinite and One Unity, secondless and causeless as Parabrahman. Ain-Soph is the indivisible point, and therefore, as “being everywhere and nowhere,” is the absolute All. It is also “Darkness” because it is absolute Light, and the Root of the seven fundamental Cosmic Principles. Yet Éliphas Lévi, by simply stating that “Darkness was upon the face of the Earth,” fails to show ( a ) that “Darkness” in this sense is Deity Itself, and he is therefore withholding the only philosophical solution of this problem for the human mind; and ( b ) he allows the unwary student to believe that by “Earth” our own little globe—an atom in the Universe—is meant. In short, this teaching does not embrace the Occult Cosmogony, but deals simply with Occult Geology and the formation of our cosmic speck. This is further shown by his making a résumé of the Seph ī r ō thal Tree in this wise: God is harmony, the astronomy of Powers and Unity outside of the World. This seems to suggest ( a ) that he teaches the existence of an extra-cosmic God, thus limiting and conditioning both the Kosmos and the divine Infinity and Omnipresence, which cannot be extraneous to or outside of one single atom; and ( b ) that by skipping the whole of the pre-cosmic period—the manifested Kosmos here being meant—the very root of Occult teaching, he explains only the Kabalistic meaning of the deadletter of the Bible and Genesis , leaving its spirit and essence untouched. Surely the “ranges of perception” of the Western mind will not be greatly enlarged by such a limited teaching. Having said a few words on Tohu-vah-bohu—the meaning of which Wordsworth rendered graphically as “higgledypiggledy”—and having explained that this term denoted Cosmos, he teaches that: Above the dark abyss [Chaos] were the Waters; . . . the earth [ la terre! ]"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"EASTERN AND WESTERN OCCULTISM  235 was Tohu-vah-bohu, i.e ., in confusion, and darkness covered the face of the Deep, and vehement Breath moved on the Waters when the Spirit exclaimed [?], “Let there be light,” and there was light. Thus the earth [our globe, of course] was in a state of cataclysm; thick vapours veiled the immensity of the sky, the earth was covered with waters and a violent wind was agitating this dark ocean, when at a given moment the equilibrium revealed itself and light re-appeared; the letters that compose the Hebrew word “Ber ē sh ī th” (the first word of Genesis ) are “Beth,” the binary, the verb manifested by the act, a feminine letter; then “Resch,” the Verbum and Life, number 20, the disc multiplied by 2; and “Aleph,” the spiritual principle, the Unit, a masculine letter. Place these letters in a triangle and you have the absolute Unity, that without being included into numbers creates the number, the first manifestation, which is 2, and these two united by harmony resulting from the analogy of contraries [opposites], make 1, only. This is why God is called El ō h ī m (plural). All this is very ingenious, but is very puzzling, besides being incorrect. For owing to the first sentence, “Above the dark abyss were the Waters,” the French Kabalist leads the student away from the right track. This an Eastern Chela will see at a glance, and even one of the profane may see it. For if the Tohu-vah-bohu is “under” and the Waters are “above,” then these two are quite distinct from each other, and this is not the case. This statement is a very important one, inasmuch as it entirely changes the spirit and nature of Cosmogony, and brings it down to a level with exoteric Genesis —perhaps it was so stated with an eye to this result. The Tohu-vah-bohu is the “Great Deep,” and is identical with “the Waters of Chaos,” or the primordial Darkness. By stating the fact otherwise it makes both “the Great Deep” and the “Waters”—which cannot be separated except in the phenomenal world—limited as to space and conditioned as to their nature. Thus Éliphas in his desire to conceal the last word of Esoteric Philosophy, fails—whether intentionally or otherwise does not matter—to point out the fundamental principle of the one true Occult Philosophy, namely, the unity and absolute homogeneity of the One Eternal Divine Element, and he makes of the Deity a male God. Then he says: Above the Waters was the powerful Breath of the El ō h ī m [the creative Dhy ā ni-Chohans]. Above the Breath appeared the Light, and above the Light the Word . . . that created it. Now the fact is quite the reverse of this: it is the Primeval 236  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS Light that creates the Word or Logos, who in his turn creates physical light.

The construction of the above sentences shows that the learned Abbé had a decided tendency to anthropomorphize creation, even though the latter has to be shaped out of preexisting material, as the Zohar shows plainly enough.

Rather an affirmation of the materiality of a personal God. If a man has to seek his Deity in the Had ē s of the ancients—for the Tohu-vah-bohu, or the Limb us of the Greeks, is the Hall of Had ē s—then one can wonder no longer at the accusations b rought forward by the Church against the “witches” and sorcerers versed in Western Kabalism, that they adored the goat Mendes, or the devil personified by certain spooks and Elementals. But in face of the task Éliphas Lévi had set before himself—that of reconciling Jewish Magic with Roman ecclesiasticism—he could say nothing else.

Not only are his explanations unsatisfactory and misleading—in his published works they are still worse—but his Hebrew transliteration is entirely wrong; it precludes the student, who would compare it for himself with the equivalent symbols and numerals of the words and letters of the Hebrew alphabet, from finding anything of that he might have found were the words correctly spelt in the French transliteration. Compared even with exoteric Hindu Cosmogony, the philosophy which Éliphas Lévi gives out as Kabalistic is simply mystical Roman Catholicism adapted to the Christian Kabalah . His Histoire de la Magie shows it plainly, and reveals also his object, which he does not even care to conceal.

In this Chaos are formed the “Waters,” Mother Isis, Aditi, etc. They are the “Waters of Life,” in which primordial germs are created—or rather reawakened—by the primordial Light. It is Purush ō ttama, or t he Divine Spirit, which in its capacity of N ā r ā ya Š a , the Mover on the Waters of Space, fructifies and infuses the Breath of life into that germ which becomes the “Golden Mundane Egg,” in which the male Brahm ā is created;* and from this the first Praj ā pati, the L ord of Beings, emerges, and becomes the progenitor of mankind.

In Egypt Osiris was Fire, and Isis was the Earth or its synonym Water; the two opposing elements—just because of their opposite properties—being necessary to each other for a common object; that of procreation. The earth needs solar heat and rain to make her throw out her germs. But these procreative properties of Fire and Water, or Spirit and Matter, are symbols but of physical generation. While the Jewish Kabalists symbolized these elements only in their application to manifested things, and reverenced them as the emblems for the production of terrestrial life, the Eastern Philosophy noticed them only as an illusive emanation from their spiritual prototypes, and no unclean or unholy thought marred its Esoteric religious symbology. Chaos, as shown elsewhere, is Theos, which becomes Kosmos: it is Space, the container of everything in the Universe. As Occult Teachings assert, it is called by the Chaldaeans, Egyptians, and every other nation Tohu-vah-bohu, or Chaos, Confusion, because Space is the great storehouse of Creation, whence proceed, not forms alone, but also ideas, which could receive their expression only through the Logos, the Word, Verbum, or Sound.

The tiller of the soil, who is the typical producer of social life, must have his material, his earth, his sky, rain, and sun, and the seeds to place within the earth; out of nothing he can produce nothing. Out of a void, nature cannot arise; there is that material beyond, behind, or within, from which she is shaped by our desire for a universe.” [pp. 71-72, Adyar ed.; p. 47, T.U.P. ed.] ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"244  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS of the veil that we can perceive, the first number being lost in its inaccessible solitude. . . .

For this is what is found in a Kabalist manuscript: It is said of the Heavens and the Earth in the second verse of Genesis that they were “Chaos and Confusion”—that is, they were “Tohu-vah-bohu,” “and darkness was upon the face of the deep,” i.e., “the perfect material out of which construction was to be made lacked organization.” The order of the digits of these words as they stand— i.e .,† the letters rendered by their numerical value—is 6,526,654 and 2,386.

The Mysteries were imparted to the elect of that Race when the average Atlantean had begun to fall too deeply into sin to be trusted with the secrets of Nature. Their establishment is attributed in the Secret Works to the King-Initiates of the divine dynasties, when the “Sons of God” had gradually allowed their country to become Kukarmade ś a (the land of vice). The antiquity of the Mysteries may be inferred from the history of the worship of Hercules in Egypt. This Hercules, according to what the priests told Herodotus, was not Grecian, for he says: Of the Grecian Hercules I could in no part of Egypt procure any knowledge: . . . the name was never borrowed by Egypt from Greece. . . Hercules, . . . as they [the priests] affirm, is one of the twelve (great Gods), who were reproduced from the earlier eight Gods 17,000 years before the year of Amasis.

Upon his arrival, Hah ā , Huh ū , and other Gandharvas were singing before the t hrone, and Raivata, waiting till they had done, imagined that but one Muh ū rta (instant) h ad passed, whereas long ages had elapsed. When they had finished, Raivata prostrated himself and explained his perplexity. Then Brahm ā asked him whom he wished for a s on-in-law, and upon hearing a few personages named, the Father of the World smiled and said: “Of those whom you have named the third and fourth generation [Root-Races] no longer survive, for many successions of ages [Chatur-Yuga, or the four Yuga cycles] have passed away while you were listening to our songsters. Now on earth the twenty-eighth great age of the present Manu is nearly finished and the Kali period is at hand. You must therefore bestow this virgin-gem upon some other husband. For you are now alone.” Then the Raj ā Raivata is told to proceed to K u \u0001 asthal... , his ancient capital, which was now called Dv ā rak ā , and where reigned in his stead a portion of the di vine being ( VishŠu ) in the person of Baladeva, the brother of K \u0001 ishŠa , regarded as the seventh incarnation of VishŠu whenever K \u0001 ishŠa is taken as a full divinity. “Being thus instructed by the Lotus-born [Brahm ā ], Raivata returned (with his d aughter) to earth, where he found the race of men dwindled in stature [see what is said in the Stanzas and Commentaries of the races of mankind gradually decreasing 248  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS in stature],* reduced in vigour, and enfeebled in intellect. Repairing to the city of Ku ś asthal ī , he found it much altered,” because, according to t he allegorical explanation of the commentator, “ K \u0001 ishŠa had reclaimed from the sea a portion of the country,” which means in plain language that the continents had all been changed meanwhile—and “had renovated the city”—or rather built a new one, Dv ā rak ā ; for one reads in the B hagavata-Pur ā Š a † that Ku ś asthali was founded and built by Raivata within the sea; and subsequent discoveries showed that it was the same, or on the same spot, as Dv ā rak ā .

As says the Commentary: Men had not created evil yet in those days of bliss and purity, for they were of God-like more than of human nature . But when mankind, rapidly increasing in numbers, increased also in variety of idiosyncrasies of body and mind, then incarnated Spirit showed its weakness. Natural exaggerations, and along with these superstitions, arose in the less cultured and healthy minds. Selfishness was born out of desires and passions hitherto unknown, and but too often knowledge and power were abused, until finally it became necessary to limit the number of those who knew . Thus arose Initiation. Every separate nation now arranged for itself a religious system, according to its enlightenment and spiritual wants. Worship of mere form being discarded by the wise men, these confined true knowledge to the very few. The need of veiling truth to protect it from desecration becoming more apparent with every generation, a thin veil was used at first, which had to be gradually thickened according to the spread of personality and selfishness, and this led to the Mysteries. They came to be established in every country and among every people, while to avoid strife and misunderstanding exoteric beliefs were allowed to grow up in the minds of the profane masses. Inoffensive and innocent in their incipient stage—like a historical event arranged in the form of a fairy tale, adapted for and comprehensible to the child’s mind—in those distant ages such beliefs could be allowed to grow and make the popular faith without any danger to the more philosophical and abstruse truths taught in the sanctuaries. Logical and scientific observation of the phenomena in Nature, which alone leads man to the knowledge of eternal truths—provided he approaches the threshold of observation unbiassed by preconception and sees with his spiritual eye before he looks at things from their physical aspect—does not lie within the province of the masses. The marvels of the One Spirit of Truth, the ever-concealed and inaccessible Deity, can be unravelled and assimilated only through Its manifestations by the secondary “Gods,” Its acting powers.

The Mysteries had their weak points and their defects, as every institution welded with the human element must necessarily have.

How were Initiation and the Initiates regarded during some 2,000 years by the Greek and Roman writers? Cicero informs his readers in very clear terms. He says: An Initiate must practise all the virtues in his power: justice, fidelity, liberality, modesty, temperance; these virtues cause men to forget the talents that he may lack:* Ragon says: When the Egyptian priests said: “All for the people, nothing through the people,” they were right: in an ignorant nation truth must be revealed only to trustworthy persons. . .

To this the answer is possible: “The cowl does not make the friar.” If one may believe tradition and the unanimous opinion of ancient writers, added to the examples we have in the “priests” of India, the most conservative nation in the world, it becomes quite certain that the Egyptian priests were no more priests in the sense we give to the word than are the temple Br ā hmans. They could never be regarded as such if we ta ke as our standard the European clergy. Laurens observes very correctly that: The priests of Egypt were not, strictly speaking ministers of religion. The word “priest,” which translation has been badly interpreted, had an acceptation very different from the one that is applied to it among us. In the language of antiquity, and especially in the sense of the initiation of the priests of ancient Egypt, the word “priest” is synonymous with that of “philosopher.” . . .

No Initiate was one if he could not heal—aye, recall to life from apparent death (coma) those who, too long neglected, would have indeed died during their lethargy.* Those who showed such powers were forthwith set above the crowds, and were regarded as Kings and Initiates. Gautama Buddha was a King-Initiate, a healer, and recalled to life those who were in the hands of death. Jesus and Apollonius were healers, and were both addressed as Kings by their followers. Had they failed to raise those who were to all intents and purposes the dead, none of their names would have passed down to posterity; for this was the first and crucial test, the certain sign that the Adept had upon Him the invisible hand of a primordial divine Master, or was an incarnation of one of the “Gods.” The later royal privilege descended to our Fifth Race kings through the kings of Egypt. The latter were all initiated into the mysteries of medicine, and they healed the sick, even when, owing to the terrible trials and labors of final Initiation, they were unable to become full Hierophants. They were healers by privilege and by tradition, and were assisted in the healing art by the Hierophants of the temples, when they themselves were ignorant of Occult curative Science. So also in far later historical times we find Pyrrhus curing the sick by simply touching them with his foot; Vespasian and Hadrian needed only to pronounce a few words taught to them by their Hierophants, in order to restore sight to the blind and health to the cripple.

Whence the wonderful knowledge of the Egyptian Priests in every department of Science, unless they had it from a still more ancient source? The famous “Four,” the seats of learning in old Egypt, are more historically certain than the beginnings of modern England. It was in the great Theban sanctuary that Pythagoras upon his arrival from India studied the Science of Occult numbers. It was in Memphis that Orpheus popularized his too-abtruse Indian metaphysics for the use of Magna Grecia ; and thence Thales, and ages later Democritus, obtained all they knew. It is to Saïs that all the honor must be given of the wonderful legislation and the art of ruling people, imparted by its Priests to Lycurgus and Solon, who will both remain objects of admiration for generations to come. And had Plato and Eudoxus never gone to worship at the shrine of Heliopolis, most probably the one would have never astonished future generations with his ethics, nor the other with his wonderful knowledge of mathematics.* The great modern writer on the Mysteries of Egyptian Initiation—one, however, who knew nothing of those in India--the late Ragon, has not exaggerated in maintaining that: All the notions possessed by Hindustan, Persia, Syria, Arabia, Chaldaea, Sydonia, and the priests of Babylonia [on the secrets of Nature], were known to the Egyptian priests.

Initiation, though it contained neither rules and principles, nor any special teaching of Science—as now understood—was nevertheless Science, and the Science of sciences. And though devoid of dogma, of physical discipline, and of exclusive ritual, it was yet the one true Religion—that of eternal truth. Outwardly it was a school, a college, wherein were taught sciences, arts, ethics, legislation, philanthropy, the cult of the true and real nature of cosmic phenomena; secretly, during the Mysteries, practical proofs of the latter were given. Those who could learn truth on all things— i.e ., those who could look the great Isis in her unveiled face and bear the awful majesty of the Goddess—became Initiates. But the children of the Fifth Race had fallen too deeply into matter always to do so with impunity. Those who failed disappeared from the world, without leaving a trace behind.

The philosophers were scientists, and philosophy was a real science— not simply verbiage, as it is in our day. The term is composed of two Greek words whose meaning is intended to convey its secret sense, and ought to be interpreted as “wisdom of love.” Now it is in the last word, “love,” that lies hidden the esoteric significance: for ‘love” does not stand here as a noun, nor does it mean “affection” or “fondness,” but is the term used for Eros, that primordial principle in divine creation, synonymous with πόθος , the abstract desire in Nature for procreation, resulting in an everlasting series of phenomena. It means “divine love,” that universal element of divine omnipresence spread throughout Nature and which is at once the chief cause and effect. The “wisdom of love” (or “philosophia”) meant attraction to and love of everything hidden beneath objective phenomena and the knowledge thereof. Philosophy meant the highest Adeptship—love of and assimilation with Deity. In his modesty Pythagoras even refused to be called a Philosopher (or one who knows every hidden thing in things visible; cause and effect, or absolute truth), and called himself simply a Sage, an aspirant to philosophy, or to Wisdom of Love—love in its exoteric meaning being as degraded by men then as it is now by its purely terrestrial application. –––––––––– 256  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS the threshold of their sacred Adytum?

He says: We have in it [in the ¬ig-Veda ] a period of the intellectual life of man to which there is no parallel in any other part of the world. In the hymns of the Veda we see man left to himself to solve the riddle of this world. . . . He invokes the gods around him, he praises, he worships them. But still with all these gods . . . . beneath him, and above him, the early poet seems ill at rest within himself. There, too, in his own breast, he has discovered a power that is never mute when he prays, never absent when he fears and trembles. It seems to inspire his prayers and yet to listen to them; it seems to live in him, and yet to support him and all around him. The only name he can find for this mysterious power is “Brahman;” for brahman meant originally force, will, wish, and the propulsive power of creation. But this impersonal brahman too, as soon as it is named, grows into something strange and divine. It ends by being one of many gods, one of the great triad, worshipped to the present day. And still the thought within him has no real name; that power which is nothing but itself, which supports the gods, the heavens, and every living being, floats before his mind, conceived but not expressed. At last he calls it “ Ā tman,” for ā tman, originally breath or spirit, comes to mean Self and Self alone, Self, whether divine or human; Self, whether creating or suffering; Self, whether One or All; but always Self, independent and 260  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS free. “Who has seen the first-born?” says the poet, “when he who had no bones ( i.e ., form) bore him that had bones? Where was the life, the blood, the Self of the world? Who went to ask this from any one who knew it?” ( ¬ig - Veda , 1, 164, 4.) This idea of a divine Self once expressed, everything else must acknowledge its supremacy; “ Self is the Lord of all things; it is the King of all things; as all the spokes of a wheel are contained in the nave and circumference, all things are contained in this Self; all selves are contained in this Self .” ( Brihad ā ranyaka , II, v. 15).* This Self, the highest, the one, and the universal, was symbolised on the plane of mortals by the Sun, its life-giving effulgence being in its turn the emblem of the Soul—killing the terrestrial passions which have ever been an impediment to the re-union of the Unit Self (the Spirit) with the All-Self. Hence the allegorical mystery, only the broad features of which may be given here. It was enacted by the “Sons of the Fire-Mist” and of “Light.” The second Sun (the “second hypostasis” of Rabbi Drach) appeared as put on his trial, Vi ś vakarman, the Hierophant, cutting off seven of his b eams, and replacing them with a crown of brambles, when the “Sun” became Vikartana, shorn of his beams or rays.

It may be found now in several of the Pur ā Šas and in other Scriptures.

Esoterically, He is the personification of the creative manifested Power; and mystically He is the seventh principle in man, in its collectivity. For He is the son of Bhuvana, the self-created, luminous Essence, and of the virtuous, chaste and lovely Yoga-Siddh ā , the virgin Goddess, whose name speaks for itself, since it personified Yoga-power, the “chaste mother” that creates the Adepts. In the ¬ig -Vaidic Hymns, Vi ś vakarman performs the “great sacrifice” i .e ., sacrifices himself for the world; or, as the Nirukta is made to say, translated by the Orientalists: Vi ś vakarman first of all offers up all the world in a sacrifice, and then ends by sacrificing himself. In the mystical representations of his character, Vi ś vakarman is often called Vithob ā , a nd is pictured as the “Victim,” the “Man-God,” or the Avat ā ra crucified in space: [At this p oint the WMS.

And here we are on firm ground, if it were only because it is now proved that the New Testament never appeared in its complete form, such as we find it now, till 300 years after the period of the apostles, and the Zohar and other Kabalistic books are found to belong to the first century before our era, if not to be far older still. “The Gnostics entertained many of the Essenean ideas; and the Essenes had their greater and minor Mysteries at least two centuries before our era. They were the Ozarim or Initiates , the descendants of the Egyptian hierophants, in whose country they had been settled for several centuries before they were converted to Buddhistic monasticism by the missionaries of King A ś oka, and amalgamated later with the earliest Christians; and they existed, probably, before the old Egyptian temples were desecrated and ruined in the incessant invasions of Persians, Greeks, and other conquering hordes. The hierophants had their atonement enacted in the Mystery of Initiation ages before the Gnostics, or even the Essenes, had appeared. It was known among hierophants as the B APTISM OF B LOOD, and was considered not as an atonement for the ‘fall of man’ in Eden, but simply as an expiation for the past, present, and future sins of ignorant, but nevertheless polluted mankind. The hierophant had the option of either offering his pure and sinless life as a sacrifice for his race to the gods whom he hoped to rejoin, or an animal victim. The former depended entirely on their own will. At the last moment of the solemn ‘new birth,’ the Initiator passed ‘the word’ to the initiated, and immediately after that the latter had a weapon placed in his right hand, and was ordered to strike . This is the true origin of the Christian dogma of atonement.” As Ballanche says, quoted by Ragon: “Destruction is the great God of the World,” justifying therefore the philosophical conception of the Hindu Ś iva. According to this immutable and sacred law, the Initiate was compelled to kill the Initiator: otherwise initiation remained incomplete. . . . It is death that generates life.” Orthodoxie maçonnique , p. 104. All that, however, was emblematic and exoteric.

It is the transmission of light, rather than a transfer of life, of life spiritual and divine, and it is the shedding of Wisdom, not of blood. But the uninitiated inventors of theological Christianity took the allegorical language à la lettre ; and instituted a dogma? the crude, misunderstood expression of which horrifies and repels the spiritual “heathen.” All these Hierophants and Initiates were types of the Sun and of the Creative Principle (spiritual potency) as were Vi ś vakarman and Vikartana, from the origin of the Myste ries. Ragon, the famous Mason, gives curious details and explanations with regard to the Sun rites. He shows that the biblical Hiram, the great hero of Masonry (the “widow’s son”), a type taken from Osiris, is the Sun-God, the inventor of arts, and the “architect,” the name Hiram, meaning the “ elevated ,” a title belonging to the Sun.

Ragon explains it by showing that the three companions of Hiram, the “three murderers,” typify the three last months of the year; and that Hiram stands for the Sun—from its summer solstice downwards, when it begins decreasing—the whole rite being an astronomical allegory. During the summer solstice, the Sun provokes songs of gratitude from all that breathes; hence Hiram, who represents it, can give to whomsoever has the right to it, the sacred Word, that is to say life. When the Sun descends to the inferior signs all Nature becomes mute, and Hiram can no longer give the sacred Word to the companions, who represent the three inert months of the year. The first companion strikes Hiram feebly with a rule twenty-four inches long, symbol of the twenty-four hours which make up each diurnal revolution; it is the first distribution of time, which after the exaltation of the mighty star, feebly assails his existence, giving him the first blow. The second companion strikes him with an iron square , THE TRIAL OF THE SUN INITIATE  265 symbol of the last season, figured by the intersections of two right lines, which would divide into four equal parts the Zodiacal circle, whose centre symbolises Hiram’s heart, where it touches the point of the four squares representing the four seasons; second distribution of time, which at that period strikes a heavier blow at the solar existence. The third companion strikes him mortally on his forehead with a heavy blow of his mallet, whose cylindrical form symbolises the year, the ring or circle; third distribution of time, the accomplishment of which deals the last blow to the existence of the expiring Sun. From this interpretation it has been inferred that Hiram, a founder of metals, the hero of the new legend with the title of architect , is Osiris (the Sun) of modern initiation; that Isis , his widow, is the Lodge , the emblem of the Earth ( loka in Sanskrit, the world) and that Horus , son of Osiris (or of light) and the widow’s son, is the free Mason , that is to say, the Initiate who inhabits the terrestrial lodge ( the child of the Widow, and of Light .) * And here again, our friends the Jesuits have to be mentioned, for the above rite is of their making. To give one instance of their success in throwing dust into the eyes of ordinary individuals to prevent their seeing the truths of Occultism, we will point out what they did in what is now called Freemasonry. This Brotherhood does possess a considerable portion of the symbolism, formulae, and ritual of Occultism, handed down from time immemorial from the primeval Initiations. To render this Brotherhood a mere harmless negation, the Jesuits sent some of their most able emissaries into the Order, who first made the simple brethren believe that the true secret was lost with Hiram Abiff; and then induced them to put this belief into their formularies. They then invented specious but spurious higher degrees, pretending to give further light upon this lost secret, to lead the candidate on and amuse him with forms borrowed from the real thing but containing no substance, and all artfully contrived to lead the aspiring Neophyte to nowhere. And yet men of good sense and abilities, in other respects, will meet at intervals, and with solemn face, zeal and earnestness, go through the mockery of revealing “substituted secrets” instead of the real things.

Hence the opposition of the losing party, and their virulence against anything mysterious or unknown. They freely organised pseudo-Rosicrucian and Masonic societies in return, . . . and these societies were instructed to irregularly entrap the weaker brethren of the True and Invisible Order, and then triumphantly betray anything they might be so inconsiderate as to communicate to the superiors of these transitory and unmeaning associations. Every wile was adopted by the authorities fighting in self-defence against the progress of truth, to engage, by persuasion, interest or terror, such as might be cajoled into receiving the Pope as Master—when gained, as many converts to that faith know, but dare not own, they are treated with neglect, and left to fight the battle of life as best they may, not even being admitted to the knowledge of such miserable aporrheta as the Romish faith considers itself entitled to withhold.

Everything that could be done had been done to destroy the original Pagan manuscripts and the Church felt secure. Christianity has undeniably had her great Seers and Prophets, like every other religion; but their claims are not strengthened by denying their predecessors.

Nevertheless, the Christians maintain that since the oracle consulted on the God Ia ō answered: “It is the Sun,” therefore The Jehovah of the Jews was well known to the Pagans and Greeks;* and “Ia ō is our Jehovah.” The first part of the proposition has nothing, it seems, to do with the second part, and least of all can the conclusion be regarded as correct. But if the Christians are so anxious to prove the identity, Occultists have nothing against it. Only, in such case, Jehovah is also Bacchus.

Outside Greece, Bacchus was the all-powerful “Zagreus, the highest of Gods,” in whose service was Orpheus, the founder of the Mysteries. Now, unless it be conceded that Moses was an initiated priest, an Adept, whose actions are all narrated allegorically, then it must be admitted that he personally, together with his hosts of Israelites, worshipped Bacchus. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi [or, Ia ō -nisi, or again Dionisi].‡ To strengthen the statement we have further to remember that the place where Osiris, the Egyptian Zagreus or Bacchus, was born, was Mount Sinai, which is called by the Egyptians Mount Nissa.

This identity of name or title is very significant.

Clement of Alexandria stigmatises the Mysteries as “indecent and diabolical” though his words, showing that the Eleusinian Mysteries were identical with, and even, as he would allege, borrowed from, those of the Jews, are quoted elsewhere in this work.

But the Katharsis, or trials of purification, have ever been misunderstood. Iamblichus explains the worst; and his explanation ought to be perfectly satisfactory, at any rate for every unprejudiced mind. He says:— Exhibitions of this kind in the Mysteries were designed to free us from licentious passions, by gratifying the sight, and at the same time vanquishing all evil thought, through the awful sanctity with which these rites were accompanied.* Dr. Wm. Warburton remarks: The wisest and best men in the Pagan world are unanimous in this, that the Mysteries were instituted pure, and proposed the noblest ends by the worthiest means. † Although persons of both sexes and all classes were allowed to take part in the Mysteries, and a participation in them was even obligatory, very few indeed attained the higher and final Initiation in these celebrated rites. The gradation of the Mysteries is given us by Proclus in the fourth book of his Theology of Plato .‡ The perfective rite, [ τελετή , telet ē ] precedes in order the initiation [ \u0012ύησις , muesis], and initiation , the final apocalypse, epopteia .

The chief objects of the Mysteries, represented as diabolical by the Christian Fathers and ridiculed by modern writers, were instituted with the highest and the most moral purpose in view.

While that resplendent thing [the prototype of the Soul-Spirit] remaineth in unchangeable condition, it is well also with its shadow. When that resplendent one removeth far from its shadow, life removeth [from the latter] to a distance. Again, that light is the shadow of something more resplendent than itself.† Thus speaks the Des ā t ī r , in the Book of Shet the Prophet Zirt ū sht , thereby showing the identity of its Esoteric doctrines with those of the Greek Philosophers. The second statement of Plato confirms the view that the Mysteries of the Ancients were identical with the Initiations practised even now among the Buddhist and the Hindu Adepts. The higher visions, the most truthful, were produced through a regular discipline of gradual Initiations, and the development of psychical powers.

The third degree was one used in both Egypt and India from time immemorial, and the remembrance of it lingers to this day in every Lodge, under the name of the death and resurrection of Hiram Abiff, the “Widow’s Son.” In Egypt the latter was called “Osiris”; in India “Loka-chakshu” (Eye of the World), and “Dinakara” (day-maker) or the Sun—and the rite itself was everywhere named the “gate of death.” The coffin, or sarcophagus, of Osiris, killed by Typhon, was brought in and placed in the middle of the Hall of the Dead, with the Initiates all around it and the candidate near by. The latter was asked whether he had participated in the murder, and not withstanding his denial, and after sundry and very hard trials, the Initiator feigned to strike him on the head with a hatchet; he was thrown down, swathed in bandages like a mummy, and wept over. Then came lightning and thunder, the supposed corpse was surrounded with fire, and was finally raised. Ragon speaks of a rumour that charged the Emperor Commodus— when he was at one time enacting the part of the Initiator—with having played this part in the initiatory drama so seriously that he actually killed the postulant when dealing him the blow with the hatchet.

The W.M. represents the rising sun, the J.W. the sun at the meridian, and the S.W. the setting sun. In the Druidical rites, the Arch-Druid represented the sun, and was aided by two other officers, one representing the moon in the West, and the other the sun at the South in its meridian. It is quite unnecessary to enter into any lengthened discussion on this symbol. It is the more “unnecessary” since J.M. Ragon has discussed it very fully, as one may find at the end of [the article] “Trial of the Sun Initiate”, where part of his explanations have been quoted. Freemasonry derived her rites from the East, as we have said. And if it be true to say of the modern Rosicrucians that “they are invested with a knowledge of chaos, not perhaps a very desirable acquisition,” the remark is still more true when applied to all the other branches of Masonry, since the knowledge of their members about the full signification of their symbols is nil . Dozens of hypotheses are resorted to, one more unlikely than the other, as to the “Round Towers” of Ireland; one fact is enough to show the ignorance of the Masons, namely, that, according to the Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia , the idea that they are connected with Masonic Initiation, may be at once dismissed as unworthy of notice. The “Towers,” which are found throughout the East in Asia, were connected with the Mystery-Initiations, namely, with the Vi ś vakarman and the Vikartana r ites. The candidates for Initiation were placed in them for three days and three nights, wherever there was no temple with a subterranean crypt close at hand. These round towers were built for no other purposes. Discredited as are all such monuments of Pagan origin by the Christian clergy, who thus “soil their own nest,” they are still the living and indestructible relics of the Wisdom of old. Nothing exists in this objective and illusive world of ours that cannot be made to serve two purposes—a good and a bad one. Thus in later ages, the Initiates of the Left Path and the anthropomorphists took in hand most of those venerable ruins, then silent and deserted by their first wise inmates, and turned them indeed into phallic monuments. But this was a deliberate, wilful, and vicious 282  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS misinterpretation of their real meaning, a deflection from their first use.

Thus the Sun was Osiris- Typhon , Ormazd- Ahriman , Bel-Jupiter and Baal , the life-giving and the death -giving luminary. And thus one and the same monolith, pillar, pyramid, tower or temple, originally built to glorify the first principle or aspect, might become in time an idol-fane, or worse, a phallic emblem in its crude and brutal form. The Li ‰ ga of the Hindus has a spiritual and highly philosophical meaning, while the missionaries see in it but an “indecent emblem”; it has just the meaning which is to be found in all those baalim, chammanim, and the bamoth with the pillars of unhewn stone of the Bible , set up for the glorification of the male Jehovah. But this does not alter the fact that the pureia of the Greeks, the nuraghes of Sardinia, the teocalli of Mexico, etc., were all in the beginning of the same character as the “Round Towers” of Ireland. They were sacred places of Initiation. In 1877, the writer, quoting the authority and opinions of some most eminent scholars, ventured to assert that there was a great difference between the terms Chr ē stos and Christos , a difference having a profound and Esoteric meaning. Also that while Christos means “to live” and “to be born into a new life,” Chr ē stos , in “Initiation” phraseology, signified the death of the inner, lower, or personal nature in man; thus is given the key to the Br ā hmanical title, the twice-born; and finally, . . . if there were no Christians , there were Chr ē stians long before the era of Christianity; and the Essenes belonged to the latter.* For this, epithets sufficiently opprobrious to characterise the writer could hardly be found.

The fact of his h aving been during his incarnation a high Initiate—he, like Orpheus, being the founder of the Mysteries— is corroborated, and made evident by his history. The Mah ā bh ā rata states that N ā rada, having frustrated the scheme formed for peopli ng the universe, in order to remain true to his vow of chastity, was cursed by Daksha, and sentenced to be born once more. Again, when born during Krishna’s time, he is accused of calling his father Brahm ā “ a false teacher,” because the latter advised him to get married, and he refused to do so. This shows him to have been an Initiate, going against the orthodox worship and religion. It is curious to find this Rishi and leader among the “Builders” and the “Heavenly Host” as the prototype of the Christian “leader” of the same “Host”—the Archangel Mikael. Both are the male “Virgins,” and both are the only ones among their respective “Hosts” who refuse to create. N ā rada is said to have dissuaded the Hari-ashvas, the five thousand sons of Daksha, begotten by him for the purpose of peopling the Earth, from producing offspring. Since then the Hari-ashvas have “dispersed themselves through the regions, and have never returned.” The Initiates are, perhaps, the incarnations of these Hari-ashvas? It was on the seventh day, the third of his ultimate trial, that the neophyte arose, a regenerated man, who, having passed through his second spiritual birth, returned to earth a glorified and triumphant conqueror of Death, a Hierophant. An Eastern neophyte in his Chr ē st condition may be seen in a certain engraving in M oor’s Hindoo Pantheon , whose author mistook another form of the crucified Sun or VishŠu , Vithob ā , for Krishna, and calls it “ K \u0001 ishŠa crucified in Space. “ The engraving is also given in Dr. Lundy’s Monumental Christianity , in which work the reverend author has collected as many proofs as his ponderous volume could hold of “Christian symbols before Christianity,” as he expresses it.

In the Crata Repoa * the following are described as four out of the seven degrees of Initiation. After a preliminary trial at Thebes, where the neophyte had to pass through many probations, called the “Twelve Tortures,” he was commanded, in order that he might come out triumphant, to govern his passions and never lose for a moment the idea of his inner God or seventh Principle. Then, as a symbol of the wanderings of the unpurified Soul, he had to ascend several ladders and wander in darkness in a cave with many doors, all of which were locked.

Of course to our grossly material minds even the sublime symbolism of Kosmos conceived in the matrix of Space after the divine Unit had entered into and fructified it with Its holy fiat, will no doubt suggest materiality. Not so with primitive mankind. The initiatory rite in the Mysteries of the self-sacrificing Victim that dies a spiritual death to save the world from destruction—really from depopulation—was established during the Fourth Race, to commemorate an event, which, physiologically, has now become the Mystery of Mysteries among the world-problems. In the Jewish script it is Cain and the female Abel who are the sacrificed and sacrificing couple—both immolating themselves (as permutations of Adam and Eve, or the dual Jehovah) and shedding their blood “of separation and union,” for the sake of and to save mankind by inaugurating a new physiological race. Later still, when the neophyte, as already mentioned, in order to be reborn once more into his lost spiritual state, had to pass through the entrails (the womb) of a virgin heifer* killed at the moment of the rite, it involved again a mystery and one as great, for it referred to the process of birth, or rather the first entrance of man onto this earth, through V ā ch—”the melodious c ow who milks forth sustenance and water”—and who is the female Logos. It had also reference to the same self-sacrifice of the “divine Hermaphrodite”—of the third Root-Race—the transformation of Humanity into truly physical men, after the loss of spiritual potency. When, the fruit of evil having been tasted along with the fruit of good, there was as a result the gradual atrophy of spirituality and a strengthening of the materiality in man, then he was doomed to be born thenceforth through the present process. This is the Mystery of the Hermaphrodite, which the Ancients kept so secret and veiled.

But we are told that in the days of Pausanias there was a sacerdotal family, who, like the Brahmans with the Vedas , had committed to memory all the Orphic Hymns, and that they were usually thus transmitted from one generation to another. By placing Orpheus so far back as 1200 B.C., official Science—so careful in her chronology to choose in each case as late a period as possible—admits that the Mysteries, or in other words Occultism dramatised, belong to a still earlier epoch than the Chaldaeans and Egyptians.

While Sacrovir—chief of the Gauls, who revolted against Roman despotism under Tiberius, and was defeated by Silius in the year 21 of our era—was burning himself alive with his fellow conspirators on a funeral pyre before the gates of the city, as Ragon tells us, the latter was sacked and plundered, and all her treasures of literature on the Occult –––––––––– * Op. cit ., pp. 22-23. † The Christian mob in 389 of our era completed the work of destruction upon what remained; most of the priceless works were saved for students of Occultism, but lost to the world. –––––––––– 296  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Sciences perished by fire.

Then he became the writer-in-chief of Hermes , a masonic paper. His best works were La Maçonnerie Occulte and the Fastes Initiatiques . After his death, in 1862, a number of his MSS. remained in the possession of the Grand Orient of France.

He says in Egypt’s Place in Universal History : . . . the origins of the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt go back to the ninth millennium [before Christ].* And as the Mysteries were performed and the Initiations took place in that Pyramid—for indeed it was built for that purpose— it looks strange and an utter contradiction with known facts in the history of the Mysteries, to suppose that Cheops, if the builder of that Pyramid, ever turned against the initiated Priests and their temples. Moreover, as far as the Secret Doctrine teaches, it was not Cheops who built the Pyramid of that name, whatever else he might have done.

Another cause may be found in the destruction and total loss of all the written memorials of the secret knowledge of the remotest antiquity. . . . Numa’s books, described by Livy, consisting of natural philosophy, were found in his tomb; but they were not allowed to be made known, lest they should reveal the most secret mysteries of the state religion. . . .

Alchemy also was first taught in Egypt by her learned Priests, though the first appearance of this system is as old as man. Many writers have declared that Adam was the first Adept; but that was a blind and a pun upon the name, which is “red earth” in one of its meanings. The correct information—under its allegorical veil—is found in the sixth chapter of Genesis , which speaks of the “Sons of God” who took wives of the daughters of men, after which they communicated to these wives many a mystery and secret of the phenomenal world. The cradle of Alchemy, says Olaus Borrichius, is to be sought in the most distant times. Democritus of Abdera was an Alchemist, and a Hermetic Philosopher. Clement of Alexandria wrote considerably upon the Science, and Moses and Solomon are called proficients in it. We are told by William Godwin: The first authentic record on this subject is an edict of Diocletian about 300 years A.D ., ordering a diligent search to be made in Egypt for all the ancient books which treated of the art of making gold and silver, that they might without distinction be consigned to the flames.† The Alchemy of the Chaldaeans and the old Chinese is not –––––––––– * [ The History of Magic by Joseph Ennemoser tr. by Wm.

Yet it was these which gave their principle features to the Neo-Platonic school of Ammonius Saccas, for the Eclectic System was chiefly characterised by its Theurgy and ecstasis. It was Iamblichus who added to it the Egyptian doctrine of Theurgy with its practices, and Porphyry, the Jew, who opposed this new element. The school, however, with but few exceptions, practised asceticism and contemplation, its mystics passing through a discipline as rigorous as that of the Hindu devotee. Their efforts never tended so much to develop the successful practice of thaumaturgy, necromancy or sorcery—such as they are now accused of—as to evolve the higher faculties of the inner man, the Spiritual Ego. The school held that a number of spiritual beings, denizens of spheres quite independent of the earth and of the human cycle, were mediators between the “Gods” and men, and even between man and the Supreme Soul. To put it in plainer language, the soul of man became, owing to the help of the Planetary Spirits, “recipient of the soul of the world” as Emerson puts it. Apollonius of Tyana asserted his possession of such a power in these words (quoted by Professor Wilder in his New Platonism ): I can see the present and the future in a clear mirror. The sage [Adept] need not wait for the vapours of the earth and the corruption of the air to foresee plagues and fevers; he must know them later than God, but earlier than the people.

All the old philosophies contained the doctrine that θεοί , theoi , gods or disposers, angels, demons, and other spiritual agencies, emanated from the Supreme Being. Ammonius accepted the doctrine of the Books of Hermes, that from the Divine All proceeded the Divine Wisdom or Amun; that from Wisdom proceeded the Demiurge or Creator; and from the Creator, the subordinate spiritual beings; the world and its people being the last. The first is contained in the second, the first and second in the third, and so on through the entire series.† This is a perfect echo of the belief of the Ved ā ntins, and it proceeds directly from the s ecret teachings of the East. The same author says: Akin to this is the doctrine of the Jewish Kabala, which was taught by the Pharsi or Pharisees, who probably borrowed it, as their sectarian designation would seem to indicate, from the Magians of Persia. It is substantially embodied in the following synopsis. The Divine Being is the All, the Source of all existence, the Infinite; and He cannot be known. The Universe reveals Him, and subsists by Him. At the beginning, His effulgence went forth everywhere.‡ Eventually He retired within Himself, and so formed around Him a vacant space. Into this He transmitted His first Emanation, a Ray, containing in it the generative and conceptive power, and hence the name IE, or J ā h. This, in its turn, produced the tikkun , the pattern or idea of form; and in this emanation, which also contained the male and female, or generative and conceptive potencies, were the three primitive forces of Light, Spirit and Life.

The “worlds” and the purifications spoken of in the 304  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Zohar and other Kabalistic books, relate to our globe and races no more and no less than they relate to other globes and other races that have preceded our own in the great cycle. It was such fundamental truths as these that were performed in allegorical plays and images during the Mysteries, the last Act of which, the Epilogue for the Mystae, was the anastasis or “continued existence,” as also the “Soul transformation.” Hence, the author of New Platonism and Alchemy shows us that all such Eclectic doctrines were strongly reflected in the Epistles of Paul, and were . . . inculcated more or less among the churches. Hence such passages as these; “Ye were dead in errors and sins; ye walked according to the ae ō n of this world, according to the archon that has the domination of the air.” “We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against the dominations, against potencies, against the lords of darkness, and against the mischievousness of spirits in the empyrean regions.” [ Eph . vi, 12.] But Paul was evidently hostile to the effort to blend his gospel with the gnostic ideas of the Hebrew-Egyptian school, as seems to have been attempted at Ephesus; and accordingly wrote to Timothy, his favorite disciple, “Keep safe the precious charge intrusted to thee; and reject the new doctrines and the antagonistic principles of the gnosis falsely so-called, of which some have made profession and gone astray from the faith.”* But as the Gnosis is the Science pertaining to our Higher Self, as blind faith is a matter of temperament and emotionalism, and as Paul’s doctrine was still newer and his interpretations far more thickly veiled, to keep the inner truths hidden far away from the Gnostic, preference has been given to the former by every earnest seeker after truth. Besides this, the great Teachers who professed the so-called “false Gnosis” were very numerous in the days of the Apostles, and were as great as any converted Rabbi could be. If Porphyry, the Jew Malek, went against Theurgy on account of old traditional recollections, there were other teachers who practised it.

All that is grand and noble in Christian theology comes from Neo-Platonism. It is too well-known now to need much repetition that Ammonius Saccas, the God-taught ( theodidaktos ) and the lover of the truth ( philal ē thes ) , in establishing his school, made a direct attempt to benefit the world by teaching those portions of the Secret Science that were permitted by its direct guardians to be revealed in those days.‡ The modern movement of our own Theosophical Society was begun on the same principles; for the Neo-Platonic school of Ammonius aimed, as we do, at the reconcilement of all sects and peoples, under the once common faith of the Golden Age, trying to induce the nations to lay aside their contentions—in religious matters at any rate—by proving to them that their various beliefs are all the more or less legitimate children of one common parent, the Wisdom-Religion.

What says history? The ecclesiastical historian, Mosheim, declares that “Ammonius, conceiving that not only the philosophers of Greece, but also all those of the different barbarous nations, were perfectly in unison with each other with regard to every essential point, made it his business so to temper and expound the tenets of all these various sects, as to make it appear they had all of them originated from one and the same source, and all tended to one and the same end.” Again, Mosheim says that Ammonius taught that “the religion of the multitude went hand in hand with philosophy, and with her had shared the fate of being by degrees corrupted and obscured with mere human conceits, superstition and lies; that it ought, therefore, to be brought back to its original purity by purging it of this dross and expounding it upon philosophical principles; –––––––––– * Op. cit ., pp. 3, 4. –––––––––– ALEXANDER WILDER 1823-1908 P OST -C HRISTIAN S UCCESSORS T O M YSTERIES 307 and that the whole which Christ had in view was to reinstate and restore to its primitive integrity the Wisdom of the ancients. . . .”* Now what was that “Wisdom of the Ancients” that the Founder of Christianity “had in view”?

For Proclus says that the doctrines of Orpheus, who was an Indian and came from India, were the origin of the systems afterwards promulgated.

So also, as we have seen, they had their secret or Esoteric teachings like any other mystic school.

This was so evident, that it forced from the Church, together with the admission of the fact, an explanation and a theory, whose clumsiness and evident sophistry are such that it must fail to impress.

Macrobius introduces them as Those Penates and tutelary deities, through whom we live and know ( Saturnalia , I. iii. ch. iv.). The teraphim through which the Hebrews consulted the oracles of the Ū r ī m and the T humm ī m, were the symbolical hieroglyphics of the Kabiri.

For if the “circle dance” prescribed by the Amazons for the Mysteries—being the “circle dance” of the planets, and characterised as “the motion of the divine Spirit carried on the waves of the great Deep”—can now be called “infernal” and “lascivious” when performed by the Pagans, then the same epithets ought to be applied to David’s dance;† and to the dance of the daughters of Shiloh,‡ and to the leaping of the prophets of Baal;§ they were all identical and all belonged to Sabaean worship.

No one ignorant of the occult versions can fail to be impressed with the proofs brought forward to show how cleverly and perseveringly “Satan has worked for long millenniums to tempt a humanity” unblessed with an infallible Church, in order to have himself recognized as the “One living God,” and his fiends as holy Angels. The reader must be patient, and study with attention what the author says on behalf of his Church. To compare it the better with the version of the Occultists, a few points may be quoted here verbatim. St. Peter tells us: “May the divine Lucifer arise in your hearts”† [Now the Sun is Christ]. . . . “I will send my Son from the Sun,” said the Eternal through the voice of prophetic traditions; and prophecy having become history the Evangelists repeated in their turn: The Sun rising from on high visited us.‡ –––––––––– * Isis Unveiled , Vol. II, p. 45. † II Epistle i, 19.

What Malachi meant by “the Sun of Righteousness” the Kabalists alone can tell; but what the Greek, and even the Protestant, theologians understood by the term is of course Christ, referred to metaphorically. Only, as the sentence, “I will send my Son from the Sun,” is borrowed verbatim from a Sibylline Book, it becomes very hard to understand how it can be attributed to, or classed with any prophecy relating to the Christian Savior, unless, indeed, the latter is to be identified with Apollo. Virgil, again, says, “Here comes the Virgin’s and Apollo’s reign,” and Apollo, or Apolou ō n, is to this day viewed as a form o f Satan, and is taken to mean the Antichrist. [The Latin Church is brave, and had the courage of her opinions at all times. Why does she not try to be logical , as she is daring? (WMS.143)] If the Sibylline promise, “He will send his Son from the Sun” applies to Christ, then either Christ and Apollo are one—and then why call the latter a demon?—or the prophecy had nothing to do with the Christian Savior, and, in such a case, why appropriate it at all? But de Mirville goes further. He shows us St. Denys, the Areopagite, affirming that The Sun is the special signification, and the statue of God* . . . “It is by the Eastern door that the glory of the Lord penetrated into the temples” [of the Jews and Christians, that divine glory being Sun-light.] . . . “We build our churches towards the east,” says in his turn St. Ambrose, “for during the Mysteries we begin by renouncing him who is in the west.”† “He who is in the west” is Typhon, the Egyptian god of darkness—the west having been held by them as the “Typhonic –––––––––– Apostle for whom divine inspiration is claimed. (WMS. 143 fn.; also in The Theosophist , Vol. LIV, August, 1933, p. 506 & fn.)] The Roman Catholics are decidedly braver and more sincere than the Protestant theologians: [See de Mirville, Des Esprits , IV, 34 and 38.] * Thus said the Egyptians and the Sabaeans in days of old, the symbol of whose manifested gods, Osiris and Bel, was the sun.

This is a question to be settled between the Roman and the Protestant Churches. [The point to show is, the strong element of heliolatry in the former-hence Sabaeanism to this day.

But one must fo r ever fail to perceive that any particular glory is rendered to Christ by assigning to him the trunk of a candlestick,* in a Jewish synagogue, as a mystical seat of honour. There are then positively two suns, a sun adored and a sun adoring. The Apocalypse proves it.

The angel in the sun seems to be an adoring sun. Who may be the latter?

Thus for Democritus “Deity is but a soul in an orbicular fire,” and that fire is the Sun.

And now the criticism of Dupuis on that verse becomes comprehensible, as also the despair of the Abbé Foucher. “Nothing is more favorable to Sabaeanism than this text of the Vulgate! ”† he exclaims. And, however disfigured may be the words and sense in the English authorised bible, the Vulgate and the Septuagint both give the correct text of the original, and translate the latter: “In the sun he established his abode”; while the Vulgate regards the “heat” as coming direct from God and not from the sun alone, since it is God who issues forth from, and dwells in the sun and performs the circuit: in sole posuit . . . . et ipse exultavit .

If the prayer “Our Father in heaven,” or “Saint” so-and-so in “Heaven” is not an idolatrous invocation, then “Our Father in Mercury,” or “Our Lady in Venus,” “Queen of Heaven,” etc., is no more so; for it is precisely the same thing, the name making no difference in the act.

Cornelius a Lapide points out and proves the meaning of the word tsaba in the first verse of Chapter ii of Genesis ; and he does so correctly, guided, as he probably was, by learned Kabalists. The Protestants are certainly wrong in their contention, for angels are mentioned in the Pentateuch under the word tsaba , which means “hosts” of angels. In the Vulgate the word is translated ornatus , meaning the “sidereal army,” the ornament also of the sky—kabalistically. The biblical scholars of the Protestant Church, and the savants among the materialists, who failed to find “angels” mentioned by Moses, have thus committed a serious error.

All the classical authors and philosophers who have treated the subject, repeat with Hermes Trismegistus, that the seven Rectors—the planets including the sun—were the associates, or the coworkers, of the Unknown All represented by the Demiourgos— commissioned to contain the Cosmos—our planetary world—within seven circles.

In a lamasery of Tibet, the missionary found the following: “It is a simple canvas without the slightest mechanical apparatus attached, as the visitor may prove by examining it at his leisure. It represents a moonlit landscape, but the moon is not at all motionless and dead; quite the reverse, for, according to the Abbé, one would say that our moon herself, or at least her living double, lighted the picture. Each phase, each aspect, each movement of our satellite, is repeated in her facsimile , in the movement and progress of the moon in the sacred picture. ‘You see this planet in the painting ride as a crescent, or full, shine brightly, pass behind the clouds, peep out or set, in a manner corresponding in the most extraordinary way with the real luminary. It is, in a word, a most perfect and resplendent reproduction of the pale queen of the night, which received the adoration of so many people in the days of old’.” We know from the most reliable sources and numerous eye-witnesses, that such “machines”—not canvas paintings—do exist in certain temples of Tibet; as also the “sidereal wheels” representing the planets, and kept for the same purposes—astrological and magical. Huc’s statement was translated in Isis Unveiled [Vol. I, p. 441] from Des Mousseaux’s volume. [ Op. cit ., 1864 ed., p. 142 fn—143 fn.] † Cedrenus, p. 338.

When all became subject to man . . . the Seven, willing to favour human intelligence, communicated to him their powers.

By reason of the extraordinary growth of human intellect and the development in our age of the fifth principle (Manas) in man, its rapid progress has paralysed spiritual perceptions. It is at the expense of wisdom that intellect generally lives, and mankind is quite unprepared in its present condition to comprehend the awful drama of human disobedience to the laws of Nature and the subsequent Fall, as a result.

Saturn, “the Father of Gods” must not be confused with his namesake—the planet of the same name with its eight moons and three rings. The two—though in one sense identical, as are, for instance, physical man and his soul—must be separated in the question of worship. This has to be done the more carefully in the case of the seven planets and their Spirits, as the whole formation of the universe is attributed to them in the Secret Teachings. The same difference has to be shown again between the stars of the Great Bear, the Riksha and the Chitra- ®ikhaŠdin , “the bright-crested,” and the ¬ishis —the mortal Sages who appeared on earth during the Satya-Yuga. If all of these have been so far closely united in the visions of the seers of every age—the Bible seers included—there must have been a reason for it. Nor need one go back so far as into the periods of “superstition” and “unscientific fancies” to find great men in our epoch sharing in them. It is well known that Kepler, the eminent astronomer, in common with many other great men who believed that the heavenly bodies ruled favourably or adversely the fates of men and nations—fully credited besides this the fact that all heavenly bodies, even our own earth, are endowed with living and thinking souls. Le Couturier’s opinion is worthy of notice in this relation: We are too inclined to criticize unsparingly everything concerning astrology and its ideas; nevertheless our criticism, to be one, ought at least to know, lest it should be proved aimless, what those ideas in truth are. And when among the men we thus criticize, we find such names as those of Regiomontanus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, etc., there is reason why we should be careful. Kepler was an astrologer by profession, and became an astronomer in consequence. He was earning his livelihood by genethliac figures, which, indicating the state of the heavens at the moment of the birth of individuals, were a means to which everyone resorted for S OULS OF THE S TARS —U NIVERSAL H ELIOLATRY 335 horoscopes. That great man was a believer in the principles of astrology, without accepting all its foolish results.* But astrology is nevertheless proclaimed as a sinful science, and together with Occultism is tabooed by the Churches. It is very doubtful, however, whether mystic “star-worship” can be so easily laughed down as people imagine—at any rate by Christians. The hosts of Angels, Cherubs and Planetary Archangels are identical with the minor Gods of the Pagans. As to their “great Gods,” if Mars has been shown—on the admission of even the enemies of the Pagan astrologers—to have been regarded by the latter simply as the personified strength of the one highest impersonal Deity, Mercury being personified as its omniscience, Jupiter as its omnipotency, and so on, then the “superstition” of the Pagan has indeed become the “religion” of the masses of the civilized nations. For with the latter, Jehovah is the synthesis of the seven El ō h ī m, the eternal centre of all those attributes and forces, the Alei of the Aleim, and the Adonai of the Adonim. And if with them Mars is now called St. Michael, the “ strength of God,” Mercury Gabriel, the “omniscience and fortitude of the Lord,” and Raphael “the blessing or healing power of God,” this is simply a change of names, the characters behind the masks remaining the same."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"[Nor are the pagans to be so despised for having adopted the names and numbers of their planets for the days of their week and their appellation (the Arabs calling their week tsaba to this day)—since it is hardly 200 years ago, that the Ausburgian Jesuits clamoured to be permitted to do the same.† –––––––––– * Musée des Sciences , p. 230. † This pious and curious attempt was denounced some years since by Camille Flammarion, the French Astronomer.

They regard them as the Powers and representatives of God, his attributes, created by him for the purpose of manifesting himself through them. It thus follows that no astrologer or occultist should be tabooed by His Holiness or any of the faithful Sons of Rome, since it is admitted by every Roman Catholic that the seven spirits of the Presence are represented by an equal number of planets, the living Entities called Arch-angels having a right to being designated as “Star-Spirits” (Esprits-Etoiles), Anges des Planetes and Anges des Astres .

It is that Protean and all pervading organisation which has, for its own purposes kept back the great truths of Occultism, making its name synonymous with charlatanism, fraud and demon worship. To this purpose was the Inquisition organised. Every imaginable device has been unscrupulously put in operation to keep the more secret laws of Nature entirely to themselves and the rest of the world in servile submission and fear. To use this knowledge and great power for such a purpose is necessarily a perversion of the laws of Nature and becomes what is known as BLACK MAGIC. When once the human mind has descended to this desecration of holy things and mental degradation, there is no crime too great or too black for it to commit. It can then contemplate the greatest human misery, individual or natural, caused by its machinations, with the utmost sang-froid and complacency, as they would upon a stepping stone to their advancement. The history of Jesuitism is the history of assassinations and poisonings, underhand dark plottings against Kings, Princes, Churches, States and solitary individuals who consciously or unconsciously cross their path.

The two subjects are closely connected. Astrolatry, or the adoration of the heavenly host, is the natural result of only half-revealed Astrology, whose Adepts carefully concealed from the noninitiated masses its Occult principles and the wisdom imparted to them by the Regents of the Planets—the “Angels.” Hence, divine Astrology for the Initiates; superstitious Astrolatry for the profane. St. Justin asserts it: From the first invention of the hieroglyphics it was not the vulgar, but the distinguished and select men who became initiated in the secrecy of the temples into the science of every kind of Astrology—even into its most abject kind: that Astrology which later on found itself prostituted in the public thoroughfares. There was a vast difference between the Sacred Science taught by Petosiris and Necepso—the first Astrologers mentioned in the Egyptian manuscripts, believed to have lived during the reign of Ramses II (Sesostris)*—and the miserable charlatanry of the quacks called Chaldaeans, who degraded the Divine Knowledge under the last Emperors of Rome. Indeed, one may fairly describe the two as the “high ceremonial Astrology” and “astrological Astrolatry.” The first depended on the knowledge by the Initiates of those (to us) immaterial Forces or Spiritual Entities that affect matter and guide it. Called by the ancient Philosophers the Archontes and the Cosmocratores, they were the types or paradigms on the higher planes of the lower and more material beings on the scale of evolution, whom we call Elementals and Nature-Spirits, to whom the Sabaeans bowed and whom they worshipped, without suspecting the essential difference.

It was the favorite form of popular or exoteric Astrology, entirely ignorant of the apotelesmatic principles of the primitive Science, the doctrines of which were imparted only at Initiation. Thus, while the real Hierophants soared like Demi-Gods to the very summit of spiritual knowledge, the hoi polloi among the Sabaeans crouched, steeped in superstition—ten millenniums back, as they do now—in the cold and lethal shadow of the valleys of matter. Sidereal influence is dual. There is the physical and physiological influence, that of exotericism; and the high spiritual, intellectual, and moral influence, imparted by the knowledge of the planetary Gods. Bailly, speaking with only an imperfect knowledge of the former, called Astrology, so far back as the eighteenth century, “The very foolish mother of a very wise daughter”—Astronomy. On the other hand, D.F.J. Arago, a luminary of the nineteenth century, supports the reality of the sidereal influence of the Sun, Moon and Planets.

How for fifty centuries and more can most men have been either dupes or knaves? . . . Even though we may find it impossible to decide between and separate the realities of Astrology from the elements of invention and empty dreaming in it, let us, nevertheless, repeat with Bossuet and all modern philosophers, that “nothing that has been dominant could be absolutely false.” Is it not true, at all events, that there is a physical reaction on one another among the planets? Is it not again true, that the planets have an influence on the atmosphere, and consequently at any rate a mediate action on vegetation and animals? Has not modern science demonstrated now these two points beyond any doubt? . . . Is it any less true that human liberty of action is not absolute; that all is bound, that all weighs, planets as the rest, on each individual will; that Providence [ or Karma ] acts on us and directs men through those relations that it has established between them and the visible objects, and the whole universe? . . .

The human Monad in its first beginning is that Spirit, or the Soul of that star (Planet) itself.

It relates, for instance, to the Pralaya of the races in their periodical dissolution, before which event a special Avat ā ra has always to descend and incarnate on earth. The se figures were adopted by all the older nations, such as those of Egypt and Chaldaea, and before them were current among the Atlanteans. Evidently some of the more learned among the early Church Fathers who had dabbled, whilst Pagans, in temple secrets, knew them to relate to the Avat ā ric or Messianic Mystery, and tried to apply this cy cle to the birth of their Messiah; they failed because the figures relate to the respective ends of the Root-Races and not to any individual. In their badly-directed efforts, moreover, an error of five years occurred. Is it possible, if their claims as to the importance and universality of the event were correct, that such a vital mistake should have been allowed to creep into a chronological computation pre-ordained and traced in the heavens by the finger of God? Again, what were the Pagan and even Jewish Initiates doing, if this claim as to Jesus be correct? Could they, the custodians of the key to the secret 354  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS cycles and Avat ā ras, the heirs of all the Ā ryan, Egyptian, and Chaldaean wisdom, have f ailed to recognize their great “God-Incarnate,” one with Jehovah,* their Savior of the"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"latter days, him whom all the nations of Asia still expect as their Kalki-Avat ā ra, M aitreya-Buddha, Saoshyant, Messiah, etc.? The simple secret is this: There are cycles within greater cycles, which are all contained in the one Kalpa of 4,320,000 years. It is at the end of this cycle that the Kalki-Avat ā ra is expected—the Avat ā ra whose name and characteristics are secret, who w ill come forth from Sambhala, the “City of Gods,” which is in the West for some nations, in the East for others, in the North or South for yet others.

No one, however fanatical, would have sufficient hardihood to maintain that the Christian era has ever been a return to the Golden Age—Virgo having actually entered into Libra since then. Let us trace as briefly as possible the Christian traditions to their true origin. First of all, they discover in a few lines from Virgil a direct prophecy of the birth of Christ. Yet it is impossible to detect in this prophecy any feature of the present age. It is in the famous fourth Eclogue in which, half a century before our era, Pollio is made to ask the Muses of Sicily to sing to him about greater events. –––––––––– * In the 1,326 places in the New Testament where the word “God” is mentioned nothing signifies that in God are included more beings than God.

As well explained by Krishna Sastri Godbole in The Theosophist : The Jews . . . represented the units (1-9) by the first nine letters of their alphabet; the tens (10-90) by the next nine letters; the first four hundreds (100-400) by the last four letters, and the remaining ones (500-900) by the second forms of the letters k ā f (llth), m ī m (13th), n ū n (13th), pe (17th), and s ā d (18th); and they represented other numbers by combining these letters according to their value. . . . The Jews of the present period still adhere to this practice of notation in their Hebrew books. The Greeks had a numerical system similar to that used by the Jews, but they carried it a little further by using letters of the alphabet with a dash or slant-line behind, to represent thousands (1000-9000), tens of thousands (10,000-90,000) and one hundred of thousands (100,000); the last, for instance, being represented by rho with a dash behind, while rho singly represented 100. The Romans represented all numerical values by the combination (additive when the second letter is of equal or less value) of six letters of their alphabet: i(=l), v(=5), x(=10), c (for “centum”= 100), d(=500), and m(=1000): thus 20=xx, 15=xv, and 9=ix. These are called the Roman numerals, and are adopted by all European nations when using the Roman alphabet. The Arabs at first followed their neighbours, the Jews, in their method of computation, so much so that they called it Abj ā d from the first four Hebrew letters— ā lif , beth, gimel —or rather jimel , that is j ī m . (Arabic being wanting in “g”, and d ā leth , representing the first four units. But when in the early part of the Christian era, they came to India as traders, they found the country already using for computation the decimal scale of notation, which they forthwith borrowed literally; viz ., without altering its method of writing from left to right, at variance with their own mode of writing, which is from right to left. They introduced this system into Europe through Spain and other European countries lying along the coast of the Mediterranean and under their sway, during the dark ages of S ECRET C YCLES   361 European history. It thus becomes evident that the Ā ryas knew well Mathematics or the science of computation at a time when all other nations knew but little, if anything, of it. It has also been admitted that the knowledge of Arithmetic and Algebra was first obtained from the Hindus by the Arabs, and then taught by them to the Western nations. This fact convincingly proves that the Ā ryan civilisation is older than that of any other nation in the world; and as the Vedas are avowedly proved the oldest work of that civilisation, a presumption is raised in favour of their great antiquity. . . .* But while the Jewish nation, for instance—regarded so long as the first and oldest in the order of creation—knew nothing of arithmetic and remained utterly ignorant of the decimal scale of notation—the latter existed for ages in India before the actual era.

The secret meaning of the latter will never be understood by the present generation of Orientalists; and the astronomical works which give openly the real dates and prove the antiquity of both the nation and its science, elude the grasp of the collectors of ollas and old manuscripts in India, the reason being too obvious to need explanation.

Those who feel interested in the demonstrations and are advanced mathematicians can turn to the article itself, “Antiquity of the Vedas ,” and judge for themselves. 10. Som ā kara in his commentary on the Ś esha Jyotisha quotes a passage from the Ś atapatha-Br ā hmana which contains an observation on the change of the tropics, and which is also found in the S ā kh ā yana Br ā hma Š a , as has been noticed by Prof. Max Müller in his preface to ¬igveda Samhit ā (p. xx, foot-note, Vol. IV). The passage is this: . . . “The full-moon night in Ph€lgun... is the first night of Samvatsara, the first year of the quinquennial age.” This passage clearly shows that the quinquennial age which, according to the sixth verse of the Jyotisha , begins on the 1st of M ā gha (January-February), once began on the 15th of Ph ā lgun ī (February-March). Now when the 15th of Ph ā lgun ī of the first year called Samvatsara of the quinquennial age begins, the moon, according to the Jyotisha , is in the sun in or 3/4th of the Uttar ā Ph ā lgun ī , and or 1/4th of P ū rva Bh ā drap ā d ā . Hence the position of the four principal points on the ecliptic was then as follows: The winter solstice in 3 o 22’ of P ū rva Bh ā drap ā d ā .

When the winter solstice by its retrograde motion coincided after that with the beginning of Prva Bh ā drap ā d ā , then the commencement of the quinquennial age was changed from the 15th to the 1st of Ph ā lgun ī (February-March). This change took place 240 years after the date of the above observation, that is, in 3101 B.C . This date is most important, as from it an era was reckoned in after times. The commencement of the Kali or Kali-Yuga (derived from Kal , to reckon), though said by European scholars to be an imaginary date, becomes thus an astronomical fact. INTERCHANGE OF KRITTIK š AND A®VINŸ* 11. We thus see that the asterisms, twenty-seven in number, were counted from the M \u0001 iga \u0001 ... rsha when the vernal equinox was in its beginning, and that the practice of thus counting was adhered to till the vernal equinox retrograded to the beginning of K \u0001 ittik€ , when it became the first of the asterisms. For then the winter solstice had changed, receding from Ph ā lgun ī (February-March) to M ā gha (January-February), one complete lunar month. And, in like manner, the place of K \u0001 ittik ā was occupied by A ś vin ī , that is, the latter became the first of the asterisms, heading all others, when its beginning coincided with the vernal equinoctial point, or, in other words, when the winter solstice was in Pansha (December-January). Now from the beginning of K \u0001 ittik ā to that A \u0001 vin ī there are two asterisms, or 26 2/3 o , and the time the equinox takes to retrograde this distance at the rate of 1 o in 72 years is 1920 years; –––––––––– * The impartial study of Vaidic and Post-Vaidic works shows that the ancient Ā ryans knew well the precession of the equinoxes, and “that they changed their position from a certain asterism to two (occasionally three) asterisms back, whenever the precession amounted to two, properly speaking, to 2 11/61 asterisms or about 29 o , being the motion of the sun in a lunar month, and so caused the seasons to fall back a complete lunar month. . . .

The astronomers of Europe change westward the beginning of Aries and of all other signs of the Zodiac every year by about 50.25\", and thus make the names of the signs meaningless.

The next and equally important observation we have to record here, is one discussed by Mr. John Bentley in his researches into the Indian antiquities. “The first lunar asterism,” he says, “in the division of twenty-eight was called M ū la, that is to say, the root or origin. In the division of twenty-seven the first lunar asterism was called Jyeshtha, that is to say, the eldest or first, and consequently of the same import as the former” ( vide his Historical View of the Hindu Astronomy . . . p. 5).* From this it becomes manifest that the vernal equinox was once in the beginning of M ū la, and M ū la was reckoned the first of the asterisms when they were twenty-eight in number, including Abhijit. Now there are fourteen asterisms or 180 o from the beginning of M \u0001 iga śī rsha to that of M ū la, and hence the date at which the vernal equinox coincided with the beginning of M ū la was at least 3341 + 180 X 72 = 16,301 B.C . The position of the four principal points on the ecliptic was then as given below: The winter solstice in the beginning of Uttar ā -Ph ā lgun ī in the month of ®ravaŠa .

The Bhagavad-G ī t ā , as well as the Bh ā gavata , makes mention of an observation which points to a still more remote antiquity than the one discovered by Mr. Bentley. The passages are given in order below: “I am the M ā rga śī rsha [ viz . the first] among the months and the spring [viz. the first] among the seasons.” This shows that at one time the first month of spring was M ā rga \u0001 ī rsha. A season includes two months, and the mention of a month suggests the season. “I am the Samvatsara among the years [which are five in number], and the spring among the seasons, and the M ā rga śī rsha among the months, and the Abhijit among the asterisms [which are twenty-eight in number].” This clearly points out that at one time in the first year called Samvatsara, of the quinquennial age, the Madhu, that is, the first month of –––––––––– * [In current reprint of the 1825 ed. by Biblio-Verlag, Osnabrück, 1970.] –––––––––– S ECRET C YCLES  365 spring, was M ā rga śī rsha, and Abhijit was the first of the asterisms. It then coincided with the vernal equinoctial point, and hence from it the asterisms were counted. To find the date of this observation: There are three asterisms from the beginning of M ū la to the beginning of Abhijit, and hence the date in question is at least 16,301 + 3/7 X 90 X 72 = 19,078 or about 20,000 B.C. The Samvatsara at this time began in Bh ā drap ā d ā the winter solstitial month.* So far then 20,000 years are mathematically proven for the antiquity of the Vedas . And this is simply exoteric. Any mathematician, provided he be not blinded by preconception and prejudice, can see this, and an unknown but very clever amateur Astronomer, S. A. Mackey, has proved it some sixty years back. His theory about the Hindu Yugas and their length is curious—as being so very near the correct doctrine. It is said in volume ii. p. 103, of Asiatic Researches † that: “The great ancestor of Yudhishthira reigned 27,000 years . . . at the close of the brazen age.” In volume ix. p. 364, [and 86] we read: “[In] the commencement of the Kali Yuga , in the reign of Yudhishthira.” And Yudhishthira . . . “began his reign immediately after the flood called Pralaya.” Here we find three different statements concerning Yudhishthira . . . to explain these seeming differences we must have recourse to their books of science, where we find the heavens and the earth divided into five parts of unequal dimensions, by circles parallel to the equator.

Between this circle and the pole there is another imaginary circle called the circle of perpetual apparition : between which and the equator there is a point in the heavens called the zenith, through which let another imaginary circle pass, parallel to the other two; and then there wants but the circle of perpetual occultation to complete the round. . . .

Whether the Hindu astronomers were acquainted with the motion of the earth or not is of no consequence, since the appearances are the same; and if it will give those gentlemen of tender consciences any pleasure I am willing to admit that they imagined the heavens rolled round the earth, but they had observed the stars in the path of the sun to move forward through the equinoctial points, at the rate of fifty-four seconds of a degree in a year, which carried the whole zodiac round in 24,000 years; in which time they also observed that the angle of obliquity varied, so as to extend or contract the width of the tropics 4 degrees on each side, which rate of motion would carry the tropics from the equator to the poles in 540,000 years; in which time the Zodiac would have made twenty-two and a half revolutions, which are expressed by the parallel circles from the equator to the poles . . or what amounts to the same thing, the north pole of the ecliptic would have moved from the north pole of the earth to the equator. . . . Thus the poles become inverted in 1,080,000 years, which is their Mah ā -Yuga, and which they had divided into four unequal parts, in the proportions of l, 2, 3, 4, for the reasons mentioned above; which are 108,000, 216,000, 324,000, and 432,000. Here we have the most positive proofs that the above numbers originated in ancient astronomical observations and consequently are not deserving of those epithets which have been bestowed upon them by the Essayist, echoing the voice of Bentley, Wilford, Dupuis, etc. I have now to show that the reign of Yudhishthira for 27,000 years is neither absurd nor disgusting , but perhaps the Essayist is not aware that there were several Yudhishthiras or Judhisters. In volume ii., p.103, Asiatic Researches : “The great ancestor of Yudhishthira reigned 27,000 years. . . . at the end of the brazen or third age.” Here I must again beg your attention to this projection. This is a plane of that machine which the second gentleman thought so very clumsy; it is that of a prolong spheroid , called by the ancients an atroscope. Let the longest axis represent the poles of the earth, making an angle of 28 degrees with the horizon; then will the seven divisions above the horizon to the North Pole, the temple of Buddha, and the seven from the North Pole to the circle of perpetual apparition represent the fourteen Manvantaras, or very long periods of time, each of which, according to the third volume of Asiatic Researches , p. 262g., was the reign of a Menu. But Capt. Wilford, in volume v. p. 244, gives us the following information: “The Egyptians had fourteen dynasties, and the Hindus had fourteen dynasties, . . . the rulers of [which] are called Menus.” . . .

Some of the Hindus inform us that “the earth has two spindles which are surrounded by seven tiers of heavens and hells at the distance of one Raju each.” This needs but little explanation when it is understood that the seven divisions from the equator to their zenith are called Rishis or Rashas . But what is most to our present purpose to know is that they had given names to each of those divisions which the tropics passed over during each revolution of the Zodiac. In the latitude of 36 degrees where the Pole or Meru was nine steps high at Cassimere, they were called Shastras ; in latitude 28 degrees at Delhi, where the Pole or Meru was seven steps high, they were called Menus; but in 24 degrees, at Cacha, where the Pole or Meru was but six steps high, they were called Sacas. But in the ninth volume ( Asiatic Researches p. 82-83) Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, or Justice , was the first of the six Sacas; . . . the name implies the end , and as everything has two ends, Yudhishthira is as applicable to the first as to the last. And as the division on the north of the circle of perpetual apparition is the first of the Kali Yuga, supposing the tropics to be ascending, it was called the division or reign of Yudhishthira. But the division which immediately precedes the circle of perpetual apparition is the last of the third or brazen age , and was therefore called Yudhishthira and as his reign preceded the reign of the other, as the tropic ascended to the Pole or Meru, he was called the father of the other—”the great ancestor of Yudhishthira, who reigned twenty-seven thousand years , . . . at the close of the brazen age.” (Vol. ii. Asiatic Researches .) The ancient Hindus observed that the Zodiac went forward at about the rate of fifty-four seconds a year, and to avoid greater fractions, stated it at that, which would make a complete round in 24,000 years; and observing the angle of the poles to vary nearly 4 degrees each round, stated the three numbers as such, which would have given forty-five rounds of the Zodiac to half a revolution of the poles; but finding that forty-five rounds would not bring the northern tropic to coincide with the circle of perpetual apparition by thirty minutes of a degree, which required the Zodiac to move one sign and a half more, which we all know it could not do in less than 3,000 years, they were, in the case before us, added to the end of the brazen age , which lengthen the reign of that Yudhishthira to 27,000 years instead of 24,000, but, at another time they did not alter the regular order of 24,000 years to the reign of each of these long-winded monarchs, but rounded up the time by allowing a regency to continue three or four thousand years. In volume ii. p. 105, Asiatic Researches , we are told that: “Paricshit, the great nephew and successor of Yudhishthira . . . is allowed without controversy to have reigned in the interval between the brazen and earthen Ages, and to have died at the setting-in of the Kali Yug .” Here we find an interregnum at 368  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS the end of the brazen age, and before the setting-in of the Kali Yug; and as there can be but one brazen or Tret ā -Yug, i.e ., the third age, in a Maha-Yuga, of 1,080,000 years: the reign of this Paricshit must have been in the second Mah ā -Yuga, when the pole had returned to its original position, which must have taken 2,160,000 years: and this is what the Hindus call the Prajanatha Yuga.

There is an oral tradition among the Chinese Buddhists, and a written statement among the secret books of the Lamaists of Tibet, as well as a tradition among the ryans, that Gautama B UDDHA had two doctrines: one for the masses and His lay disciples, the other for His “elect,” the Arhats. His policy and after Him that of His Arhats was, it appears, to refuse no one admission into the ranks of candidates for Arhatship, but never to divulge the final mysteries except to those who had proved themselves, during long years of probation, to be worthy of Initiation. These once accepted were consecrated and initiated without distinction of race, caste or wealth, as in the case of His western successor. It is the Arhats who have set forth and allowed this tradition to take root in the people’s mind, and it is the basis, also, of the later dogma of Lamaic reincarnation or the succession of human Buddhas. The little that can be said here upon the subject may or may not help to guide the psychic student in the right direction. It being left to the option and responsibility of the writer to tell the facts as she personally understood them, the blame for possible misconceptions created must fall only upon her. She has been taught the doctrine, but it was left to her sole intuition—as it is now left to the sagacity of the reader—to group the mysterious and perplexing facts together. The incomplete statements herein given are fragments of what is contained in certain secret volumes, but it is not lawful to divulge the details. The esoteric version of the mystery given in the secret volumes may be told very briefly. The Buddhists have always stoutly denied that their B UDDHA was, as alleged by the Brahmans, an Avat ā ra of V ishŠu in the same sense as a man is an incarnation of his Karmic ancestor. They deny it partly, perhaps, because the esoteric meaning of the term “Mah ā -Vishnu” is T HE D OCTRINE OF A VAT Ā RAS  371 not known to them in its full, impersonal, and general meaning. There is a mysterious Principle in Nature called “Mah ā -Vishnu,” which is not the God of that name, but a p rinciple which contains B ī ja, the seed of Avat ā rism or, in other words, is the potency and"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"cause of such divine incarnations. All the World-Saviors, the Bodhisattvas and the Avat ā ras, are the trees of salvation grown out from the o ne seed, the B ī ja or “ Mah ā - V ishŠu .” Whether it be called Ā di-Buddha (Primeval Wisdom) or Mah ā - V ishŠu , it is all the same. Understood esoterically, VishŠu is both Saguna and NirguŠa (with and without attributes). In the first aspect, VishŠu is the object of exoteric worship and devotion; in the second, as NirguŠa , he is the culmination of the totality of spiritual wisdom in the Universe- Nirv ā Ša , * in short—and has as worshippers all philosophical minds. In this esoteric sense the Lord B UDDHA was an incarnation of Mah ā - V ishŠu . This is from the philosophical and purely spiritual standpoint. From the plane of illusion, however, as one would say, or from the terrestrial standpoint, those initiated know that He was a direct incarnation of one of the primeval “Seven Sons of Light” who are to be found in every Theogony—the Dhy ā n-Chohans whose mission it is, from one eternity ( ae ō n) to the other, to watch over the spiritual welfare of the regions under their care. This has been already enunciated in Esoteric Buddhism. One of the greatest mysteries of speculative and philosophical Mysticism—and it is one of the mysteries now to be disclosed — is the modus operandi in the degrees of such hypostatic transferences. As a matter of course, divine as well as human incarnations must remain a closed book to the theologian as much as to the physiologist, unless the esoteric teachings be accepted and become the religion of the world. This teaching –––––––––– * A great deal of misconception is raised by a confusion of planes of being and misuse of expressions. For instance, certain spiritual states have been confounded with the Nirv ā Ša of B UDDHA . The Nirv ā Š a of B UDDHA is totally different from any other spiritual state of Samadhi or even the highest Theophania enjoyed by lesser Adepts. After physical death the kinds of spiritual states reached by Adepts differ greatly. ————— 372  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS may never be fully explained to an unprepared public; but one thing is certain and may be said now: that between the dogma of a newly-created soul for each new birth, and the physiological assumption of a temporary animal soul, there lies the vast region of Occult teaching* with its logical and reasonable demonstrations, the links of which may all be traced in logical and philosophical sequence in nature. This “Mystery” is found, for him who understands its right meaning, in the dialogue between K \u0001 ishŠa and Arjuna, in the Bhagavad-G ī t ā , Chapter iv, 5-9. Says the Avat ā ra: Many births of mine have passed, as also of yours, O Arjuna! All those I know, but you do not know yours, O harasser of your enemies.

What is the Father? Is it the absolute Cause of all?—the fathomless Eternal? No; most decidedly. It is K ā ra Š ā tman, the “Causal Soul” which, in its general s ense, is called by the Hindus Īś vara, the Lord, and by Christians, “God,” the One an d Only. From the standpoint of unity it is so; but then the lowest of the Elementals could equally be viewed in such case as the “One and Only.” Each human being has, moreover, his own divine Spirit or personal God. That divine Entity or Flame from which Buddhi emanates stands in the same relation to man, though on a lower plane, as the Dhy ā ni-Buddha to his human Buddha. Hence monotheism and polytheism are not irreconcilable; they exist in Nature. Truly, “for the salvation of the good and the destruction of wickedness,” the personalities known as Gautama, ®amkara , Jesus and a few others were born each in his age, as declared—“I am born in every Yuga”—and they were all born through the same Power. There is a great mystery in such incarnations and they are outside and beyond the cycle of general rebirths. Rebirths may be divided into three classes: the divine incarnations called Avataras; those of Adepts who give up Nirv ā na for the sake of helping on h umanity—the Nirm ā Š a k ā yas; and the natural succession of rebirths for all— the common law. The Avatra is an appearance, one which may be termed a special illusion within the natural illusion that reigns on the planes under the sway of that power, M ā y ā ; the Adept is r eborn consciously, at his will and pleasure;* the units of the common herd unconsciously follow the great law of dual evolution.

That illusive form having neither past nor future, because it had neither previous incarnation nor will have subsequent rebirths, has naught to do with Karma, which has therefore no hold on it. Gautama B UDDHA was born an Avat ā ra in one sense. But this, in view of unavoidable o bjections on dogmatic grounds, necessitates explanation. There is a great difference between an Avat ā ra and a J ī vanmukta: one, as already stated, is an illusive app earance, Karmaless, and having never before incarnated; and the other, the J ī vanmukta, is one who o btains Nirv ā na by his individual merits. To this expression agai n an uncompromising, philosophical Ved ā ntin would object. He might say that as the conditio n of the Avat ā ra a nd the J ī vanmukta are one and the same state, no amount of pe rsonal merit, in howsoever many incarnations, can lead its possessor to Nirv ā Ša . Nirv ā Ša , he would say, is actionless; how can, then, any action lead to it? It is neither a result nor a cause, but an ever-present, eternal Is , as N ā gasena defined it.* Hence it can have no relation to , or concern with, action, merit, or demerit, since these are subject to Karma. All this is very true, but still to our mind there is an important difference between the two. An Avat ā ra is; a J ī vanmukta b ecomes one. If the state of the two is identical, not so are the causes which lead to it. An Avat ā ra is a descent of a God into an illusive form; a J ī vanmukta, who may have passed t hrough numberless incarnations and may have accumulated merit in them, certainly does not become a Nirv ā Š ī because of that merit, but only because of the Karm a generated by it, which leads and guides him in the direction of the Guru who will initiate him into the mystery of Nirv ā na and who alone can help him to reach this abode.

O f the voluntary and conscious incarnations of Adepts there are two types—those of Nirm ā Š a k ā yas, and those undertaken by the probationary chelas who are on their trial. The greatest, as the most puzzling mystery of the first type lies in the fact, that such rebirth in a human body of the personal Ego of some particular Adept—when it has been dwelling in the M ā y ā vi or the K ā ma-R ™ p a, and remaining in the K ā ma-Loka— may h appen even when his “Higher Principles” are in the state of Nirv ā Ša . * Let it be understood that the above expressions are used for popular purposes, and therefore that what is written does not deal with this deep and mysterious question from the highest plane, that of absolute spirituality, nor again from the highest philosophical point of view, comprehensible but to the very few.

Firstly, to all those who are unfamiliar with the doctrine of the manifold nature and various aspects of the human Monad; and secondly to those who view the septenary division of the human entity from a too materialistic standpoint. Yet the intuitional Occultist, who has studied thoroughly the mysteries of Nirv ā na—who knows it t o be identical with Parabrahman, and hence unchangeable, eternal and no Thing but the Absolute All—will seize the possibility of the fact. They know that while a Dharmakâya—a Nirv ā Š ī “without remains,” as our Orientalists have transla ted it, being"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"absorbed into that Nothingness, which is the one real, because Absolute, Consciousness—cannot be said to return to incarnation on Earth, the Nirv ā Š ī being no l onger a he, a she, or even an it; the NirmaŠakaya —or he who has obtained Nirv ā Ša “ with remains,” i.e ., who is clothed in a subtle body, which makes him impervious to all outward impressions and to every mental feeling, and in whom the notion of his Ego has not entirely ceased—can do so. Again, every Eastern Occultist is aware of the fact that there are two kinds of Nirm ā nak ā yas—the natural, and the assumed; that the former is the name or epithet given to the condition of a high ascetic, or Initiate, who has reached a stage of bliss second only to Nirv ā na; while the latter means the self-sacrifice of one who voluntarily gives up the absolute Nirv ā Ša , in order to help humanity and be still doing it good, or, in other words, to save his fellow-creatures by guiding them. It may be objected that the Dharmak ā ya, being a Nirv ā Š ī or J ī vanmukta, can have no “remains” left behind h im after death, for having attained that state from which no further incarnations are possible, there is no need for him of a subtle body, or of the individual Ego that reincarnates from one birth to another, and that therefore the latter disappears of logical necessity; to this it is answered: it is so for all exoteric purposes and as a general law. But the case with which we are dealing is an exceptional one, and its realization lies within the Occult T HE D OCTRINE OF A VAT Ā RAS  377 powers of the high Initiate, who, before entering into the state of Nirv ā Ša , can cause his “remains” (sometimes, though not very well, called his M ā y ā vi-R ™ p a), to remain behind,* whether he is to become a Nirv ā Š ī , or to find himself in a lower state of bliss. N ext, there are cases—rare, yet more frequent than one would be disposed to expect—which are the voluntary and conscious reincarnations of Adepts on their trial. Every man has an Inner, a “Higher Self,” and also an Astral Body. But few are those who, outside the higher degrees of Adeptship, can guide the latter, or any of the principles that animate it, when once death has closed their short terrestrial life. Yet such guidance, or their transference from the dead to a living body, is not only possible, but is of frequent occurrence, according to Occult and Kabalistic teachings. The degrees of such power of course vary greatly. To mention but three: the lowest of these degrees would allow an Adept, who has been greatly trammelled during life in his study and in the use of his powers, to choose after death another body in which he could go on with his interrupted studies, though ordinarily he would lose in it every remembrance of his previous incarnation. The next degree permits him, in addition to this, to transfer the memory of his past life to his new body; while the highest has hardly any limits in the exercise of that wonderful faculty. As an instance of an Adept who enjoyed the first mentioned power some mediaeval Kabalists cite a well-known personage of the fifteenth century—Cardinal de Cusa; Karma, due to his wonderful devotion to Esoteric study and the Kabalah , led the suffering Adept to seek intellectual recuperation and rest from"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"–––––––––– * This fact of the disappearance of the vehicle of Egotism in the fully developed Yogi, who is supposed to have reached Nirv â Ša on earth, years t before his corporeal death, has led to the law in Manu, sanctioned by millenniums of Br ā hmanical authority, that such a Param ā tman should be held as absolutely blameless and free from sin or responsibility, do whatever he may (see last chapter of the Laws of Manu ).

The right comprehension of this psychic fact is based upon a correct view of that group of celestial Beings who are universally called the seven Primeval Gods or Angels—our Dhy ā ni-Chohans—the “Seven Primeval Rays” or Powers, adop ted later on by the Christian Religion as the “Seven Angels of the Presence.” Ar ™ pa, formless, at the upper rung of the ladder of Being, materializing more and more as they descend in the scale of objectivity and form, ending in the grossest and most imperfect of the Hierarchy, man—it is the former purely spiritual group that is pointed out to us, in our Occult teaching, as the nursery and fountainhead of human beings. Therein germinates that consciousness which is the earliest manifestation from causal Consciousness—the Alpha and Omega of divine being and life forever. And as it proceeds downward through every phase of existence descending through man, through animal and plant, it ends its descent only in the mineral. It is represented by the double triangle—the most mysterious and the most suggestive of all mystic signs, for it is a double glyph, embracing spiritual and physical consciousness and life, the former triangle running upwards, and the lower downwards, both interlaced, and showing the various 380  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS planes of the twice-seven modes of consciousness, the fourteen spheres of existence, the Lokas of the Br ā hmans. T he reader may now be able to obtain a clearer comprehension of the whole thing. He will also see what is meant by the “Watchers,” there being one placed as the Guardian or Regent over each of the seven divisions or regions of the earth, according to old traditions, as there is one to watch over and guide every one of the fourteen worlds or Lokas.* But it is not with any of these that we are at present concerned, but with the “Seven Breaths,” so-called, that furnish man with his immortal Monad in his cyclic pilgrimage.

Again, Jacob’s dream has the same significance. † He “of the Seven Virtues” is one who, without the benefit of Initiation, becomes as pure as any Adept by the simple exertion of his own merit.

Besides, that doctrine made him consist of kha —body; khaba —astral form, or shadow; ka —animal soul or lifeprinciple; ba —the higher soul; and akh —terrestrial intelligence. They had also a sixth principle, named sah —or mummy; but the functions of this one commenced only after the death of the body.* The seventh principle being of course the highest, uncreated Spirit was generically called Osiris, therefore every deceased person became Osirified—or an Osiris—after death. But in addition to reiterating the old, ever-present fact of reincarnation and Karma—not as taught by the Spiritists, but as by the most Ancient Science in the world—Occultists must teach cyclic and evolutionary reincarnation: that kind of rebirth, mysterious and still incomprehensible to many who are ignorant of the world’s history, which was cautiously mentioned in Isis Unveiled . A general rebirth for every individual with interlude of K ā ma-Loka and Devachan, and a cyclic conscious reincar nation with a grand and divine object for the few.

No more could be said at the time when Isis Unveiled was written; hence the statement was limited to the single remark that There is no prominent character in all the annals of sacred or profane history whose prototype we cannot find in the half-fictitious and half-real traditions of bygone religions and mythologies. As the star, glimmering at an immeasurable distance above our heads, in the boundless immensity of the sky, reflects itself in the smooth waters of a lake, so does the imagery of men of the antediluvian ages reflect itself in the periods we can embrace in an historical retrospect.* But now that so many publications have been brought out, stating much of the doctrine, and several of them giving many an erroneous view, this vague allusion may be amplified and explained. Not only does this statement apply to prominent characters in history in general, but also to men of genius, to every remarkable man of the age, who soars beyond the common herd with some abnormally developed special capacity in him, leading to the progress and good of mankind. Each is a reincarnation of an individuality that has gone before him with capacities in the same line, bringing thus as a dowry to his new form that strong and easily re-awakened capacity of quality which had been fully developed in him in his preceding birth. Very often they are ordinary mortals, the Egos of natural men in the course of their cyclic development. But it is with “special cases” that we are now concerned. Let us suppose that a person during his cycle of incarnations is thus selected for special purposes—the vessel being sufficiently clean—by his personal God, the Fountainhead (on the plane of the manifested) of his Monad, who thus becomes his in-dweller. That God, his own prototype or “Father in Heaven,” is, in one sense, not only the image in which he, the spiritual man, is made, but in the case we are considering, it is that spiritual, individual Ego himself.

In this case, after the physical translation of such a saint or Bodhisattva, his astral principles cannot be subjected to a natural dissolution like those of any common mortal.

Even in ordinary mediumistic life, so-called, it is pretty well ascertained that while the body is acting—even though only mechanically—or resting in one place, its astral double may be appearing and acting independently in another, and very often distant place. This is quite a common occurrence in mystic life and history, and if this be so with ecstatics, Seers and Mystics of every description, why cannot the same thing happen on a higher and more spiritually developed plane of existence? Admit the possibility on the lower psychic plane, then why not on a higher plane? In the cases of higher Adeptship, when the body is entirely at the command of the Inner Man, when the Spiritual Ego is completely reunited with its seventh principle even during the lifetime of the personality, and the Astral Man or personal Ego has become so purified that he has gradually assimilated all the qualities and attributes of the middle nature (Buddhi and Manas in their terrestrial aspect) that personal Ego substitutes itself, so to say, for the spiritual Higher Self, and is thenceforth capable of living an independent life on earth; when corporeal death takes place, the following 384  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS mysterious event often happens.

Yet the Christ of the old crucified body could truly say: “I am with my Father and one with Him,” which did not prevent the astral from taking a form again nor John from tarrying indeed till his Master had come; nor hinder John from failing to recognize him when he did come, or from then opposing him.

The whole trouble is to understand correctly that other mystery: that of the real fact, so abstruse and transcendental at first sight, about the “Seven Principles” in man, the reflections in man of the seven powers in Nature, physically, and of the seven Hierarchies of Being, intellectually and spiritually. Whether a man—material, ethereal, and spiritual—is for the clearer comprehension of his (broadly-speaking) triple nature, divided into groups according to one or another system, the foundation and the apex of that division will be always the same. There being only three Up ā dhis (bases) in man, any number of Ko \u0001 as ( sheaths) and their aspects may be built on these without destroying the harmony of the whole. Thus, while the Esoteric System accepts the septenary division, the Ved ā ntic c lassification gives five Ko \u0001 as, and the T ā raka R ā ja Yoga simplifies them into four—the t hree Up ā dhis synthesized by the highest principle, Ā tman. T hat which has just been stated will, of course, suggest the question: “How can a spiritual (or semi-spiritual) personality lead a triple or even a dual life, shifting respective ‘Higher Selves’ ad libitum , and be still the one eternal Monad in the infinity of a Manvantara?” The answer to this is easy for the true Occultist, while for the uninitiated profane it must appear absurd. The “Seven Principles” are, of course, the manifestation of one indivisible Spirit, but only at the end of the Manvantara, and when they come to be re-united on the plane of the One Reality, does the unity appear; during the “Pilgrim’s” journey the reflections of that indivisible One Flame, the aspects of the one eternal Spirit, have each the power of action on one of the manifested planes of existence—the gradual differentiations from the one unmanifested plane—on that plane namely to which it properly belongs. Our earth affording every M ā y ā vic condition, it follows that the purified E gotistical Principle, the astral and personal Self of an Adept, though forming in reality one integral whole with its Highest Self ( Ā tman and Buddhi) may, nevertheless, for p urposes of universal mercy and benevolence, so separate itself from its divine Monad as to lead on this plane of illusion and temporary being a distinct T HE S EVEN P RINCIPLES  387 independent conscious life of its own, under a borrowed illusive shape, thus serving at one and the same time a double purpose: the exhaustion of its own individual Karma, and the saving of millions of human beings less favored than itself from the effects of mental"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"blindness. If asked: “When the change described as the passage of a Buddha or a J ī vanmukta into Nirv ā Š a takes place, where does the original consciousness which animated the body continue to reside—in the Nirv ā Š ī or in the subsequent reincarnations o f the latter’s ‘remains’ (the Nirm ā Š a k ā ya)?” the answer is that i mprisoned consciousness may be a “certain knowledge from observation and experience,” as Gibbon puts it, but disembodied consciousness is not an effect, but a cause. It is a part of the whole, or rather a Ray on the graduated scale of its manifested activity, of the one all-pervading, limitless Flame, the reflections of which alone can differentiate; and, as such, consciousness is ubiquitous, and can be neither localized nor centered on or in any particular subject, nor can it be limited. Its effects alone pertain to the region of matter, for thought is an energy that affects matter in various ways, but consciousness per se , as understood and explained by Occult philosophy, is the highest quality of the sentient spiritual principle in us, the Divine Soul (or Buddhi) and our Higher Ego, and does not belong to the plane of materiality. After the death of the physical man, if he be an Initiate, it becomes transformed from a human quality into the independent principle itself; the conscious Ego becoming Consciousness per se without any Ego, in the sense that the latter can no longer be limited or conditioned by the senses, or even by space or time. Therefore it is capable, without separating itself from or abandoning its possessor, Buddhi, of reflecting itself at the same time in its astral man that was, without being under any necessity for localizing itself. This is shown at a far lower stage in our dreams. For if consciousness can display activity during our visions, and while the body and its material brain are fast asleep—and if even during those visions it is all but ubiquitous—how much greater must be its power when entirely free from, and having no more connection with, our physical brain.

The same with Jesus: from the age of twelve to thirty years, when He is found preaching the sermon on the Mount, nothing is positively said or known of Him. Gautama had sworn inviolable secrecy as to the Esoteric Doctrines imparted to Him. In His immense pity for the ignorance—and as its consequence the sufferings—of mankind, desirous though He was to keep inviolate His sacred vows, He failed to keep within the prescribed limits. While constructing His Exoteric Philosophy (the “Eye-Doctrine”) on the foundations of eternal Truth, He failed to conceal certain dogmas, and trespassing beyond the lawful lines, caused those dogmas to be misunderstood. In His anxiety to make away with the false Gods, He revealed in the “Seven Paths to Nirv ā Š a ” some of the mysteries of the Seven Lights of the Ar ™ pa (formless) World. A little of the truth is often worse than no truth at all. Truth and fiction are like oil and water: they will never mix. His new doctrine, which represented the outward dead body of the Esoteric Teaching without its vivifying Soul, had disastrous effects: it was never correctly understood, and the doctrine itself was rejected by the Southern Buddhists. Immense philanthrophy, a boundless love and charity for all creatures, were at the bottom of His unintentional mistake; but Karma little heeds intentions, whether good or bad, if they remain fruitless. If the “Good Law,” as preached, resulted in the most sublime code of ethics and the unparalleled philosophy of things external in the visible Kosmos, it biassed and misguided immature minds into believing there was nothing more under the outward mantle of the system, and its dead-letter only was accepted.

Their interrelation is the following: The Dhy ā ni-Buddha, when the world n eeds a human Buddha, “creates” through the power of Dhy ā na (meditation, omnipotent d evotion), a mind-born son—a Bodhisattva—whose mission it is after the physical death of his human, or M ā nushya-Buddha, to continue his work on earth till th e appearance of the subsequent Buddha. The Esoteric meaning of this teaching is clear. In the case of a simple mortal, the principles in him are only the more or less bright reflections of the seven cosmic, and the seven celestial Principles, the Hierarchy of supersensual Beings. In the case of a Buddha, they are almost the principles in esse themselves. The Bodhisattva replaces in him the K ā ra Š a ® ar ī ra, the Ego principle, and the rest correspondingly; and it is in this way that Esoteric Philosophy explains the meaning of the sentence that “by virtue of Dhy ā na [or abstract meditation] the Dhy ā ni-Buddha [the Buddha’s Spirit or Monad] c reates a Bodhisattva,” or the astrally clothed Ego within the M ā nushya-Buddha.

But it must be remembered that the higher ethereal principles are not, like the lower, more material ones, visible sometimes to man (as astral bodies), and they have to be regarded in the light of separate or independent Powers or Gods, rather than as material objects. Hence the right way of representing the truth would be to say that the various principles, the Bodhisattva, of Gautama Buddha, which did not go to Nirv ā Š a , reunited to form the middle principles of ® amkar ā ch ā rya, the e arthly Entity.* It is absolutely necessary to study the doctrine of the Buddhas esoterically, and understand the subtle differences between the various planes of existence, to be able to comprehend correctly the above. Put more clearly, Gautama, the human Buddha, who had, exoterically, Amit ā bha for his Bodhisattva and Avalokite ś vara for his D hy ā ni-Buddha—the triad emanating directly from Ā di-Buddha—assimilated these by his “ Dhyana” (meditation) and thus became a Buddha (“enlightened”).

What are the seven ? The seven branches of complete knowledge. What are the six ? The six organs of sense. What are the five? The five elements of illusive being. And the ONE which is also ten? He is a true Buddha who developes in him the ten forms of holiness and subjects them all to the one.” Which means that every principle in the Buddha was the highest that could be evolved on this earth; whereas in the case of other men who attain to Nirv ā Š a this is not necessarily the case. Even as a mere human (M ā nushya) Buddha, Gautama was a pattern for all men. But his Arhats were not necessarily so. [Cf. Blavatsky Collected Writings , Vol. V, p. 247.] –––––––––– T HE M YSTERY OF B UDDHA  395 if we hold for a moment to the trinitarian division of the septenary group—and his Dhy ā ni-Buddha, or Chohan, the “Father of the Son.” Our c onnecting link with the higher Hierarchy of Celestial Beings lies here in a nutshell, only we are too sinful to assimilate them. Six centuries after the translation of the human Buddha (Gautama), another Reformer, as noble and as loving, though less favored by opportunity, arose in another part of the world, among another and a less spiritual race. There is a great similarity between the subsequent opinions of the world about the two Saviors, the Eastern and the Western. While millions became converted to the doctrines of the two Masters, the enemies of both—sectarian opponents, the most dangerous of all—tore both to shreds by insinuating maliciously-distorted statements based on Occult truths, and therefore doubly dangerous. While of Buddha it is said by the Br ā hmans that He was truly an Avat ā ra of V ishŠu , but that He had come to tempt the Br ā hmans from their faith, and was therefore the evil a spect of the God; of Jesus the Bardesanian Gnostics and others asserted that He was Nebu, the false Messiah, the destroyer of the old orthodox religion. “He is the founder of a new sect"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"of Nazars,” said other sectarians. In Hebrew the word “Naba” means “to speak by inspiration” ( !,1 , and &,1 is Nebo, the God of wisdom). But Nebo is also Mercury, who is Budha in the Hindu monogram of planets. And this is shown by the fact that the Talmudists hold that Jesus was inspired by the Genius (or Regent) of Mercury confounded by Sir William Jones with Gautama Buddha. There are many other strange points of similarity between Gautama and Jesus, which cannot be noticed here.* If both the Initiates, aware of the danger of furnishing the uncultured masses with the powers acquired by ultimate knowledge, left the innermost corner of the sanctuary in profound darkness, who, acquainted with human nature, can blame either of them for this? Yet although Gautama, actuated by prudence, left the Esoteric and most dangerous portions of the Secret Knowledge untold, and lived to the ripe old age of eighty— –––––––––– * See Isis Unveiled , Vol. II, p. 132. –––––––––– 396  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS the Esoteric Doctrine says one hundred—years, dying with the certainty of having taught its essential truths, and of having sown the seeds for the conversion of one-third of the world, He yet perhaps revealed more than was strictly good for posterity. But Jesus, who had promised His disciples the knowledge which confers upon man the power of producing “miracles” far greater than He had ever produced Himself, died, leaving but a few faithful disciples—men only half-way to knowledge. They had therefore to struggle with a world to which they could impart only what they but half-knew themselves, and—no more. In later ages the exoteric followers of both mangled the truths given out, often out of recognition. With regard to the adherents of the Western Master, the proof of this lies in the very fact that none of them can now produce the promised “miracles.” They have to choose: either it is they who have blundered, or it is their Master who must stand arraigned for an empty promise, an uncalled-for boast.* Why such a difference in the destiny of the two? For the Occultist this enigma of the unequal favor of Karma or Providence is unriddled by the Secret Doctrine. It is “not lawful” to speak of such things publicly, as St. Paul tells us. One more explanation only may be given in reference to this subject. It was said a few pages back that an Adept who thus sacrifices himself to live, giving up full Nirv ā Š a , though he can never lose the knowledge acquired by him in previous existences, yet can never rise higher in such borrowed –––––––––– * “Before one becomes a Buddha he must be a Bodhisattva; before evolving into a Bodhisattva he must be a Dhy ā ni-Buddha. . . .

The “way” is not the goal. Nowhere throughout the New Testament is Jesus found calling himself God, or anything higher than “a son of God,” the son of a “Father” common to all, synthetically.

Why? Because he becomes simply the vehicle of a “Son of Light” from a still higher sphere, Who being Ar ™ pa, has no personal astral body of His own fit for this world. Such “Sons of Light,” or Dhy ā ni-Buddhas, are the Dharmak ā yas of preceding M anvantaras, who have closed their cycles of incarnations in the ordinary sense and who, being thus Karmaless, have long ago dropped their individual R ™ pas, and have become identified with the first Principle. Hence the necessity of a sacrificial Nirm ā nak ā ya, ready t o suffer for the misdeeds or mistakes of the new body in its earth-pilgrimage, without any future reward on the plane of progression and rebirth, since there are no rebirths for him in the ordinary sense. The Higher Self, or Divine Monad, is not in such a case attached to the lower Ego; its connection is only temporary, and in most cases it acts through decrees of Karma. This is a real, genuine sacrifice, the explanation of which pertains to the highest Initiation of Jñ ā na (Occult Knowledge). It is closely linked, by a direct evolution of Spirit and involution of Matter, with the primeval and great Sacrifice at the foundation of the manifested Worlds, the gradual smothering and death of the spiritual in the material. The seed “is not quickened, except it die.”* Hence in the Purusha Sukta of the ¬ig-Veda ,† the mother fount and source of all subsequent religions, it is stated allegorically that “the thousand-headed Purusha” was slaughtered at the foundation of the World, that from his remains the Universe might arise. This is nothing more nor less than the foundation—the seed, truly—of the later many-formed symbol in various religions, including Christianity, of the sacrificial lamb. For it is a play upon the words. “Aja” (Purusha), “the unborn,” or eternal Spirit, means also “lamb,” in Sanskrit. Spirit disappears—dies, metaphorically—the more it gets involved in matter, and hence the sacrifice of the “unborn,” or the “lamb.” Why the B UDDHA chose to make this sacrifice will be plain only to those who, to the minute knowledge of His earthly –––––––––– * 1 Corinth . xv, 36. † Op. cit ., Mandala X, hymn 90, 1-5. –––––––––– 398  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS life, add that of a thorough comprehension of the laws of Karma.

As tradition goes, the Br ā hmans had committed a heavy sin by persecuting Gauta ma B UDDHA and His teachings instead of blending and reconciling them with the tenets of pure Vaidic Br ā hmanism, as was done later by ® a mkar ā ch ā rya. Gautama had never gone a gainst the Vedas , only against the exoteric growth of preconceived interpretations. The ® ruti—divine oral revelation, the outcome of which was the Veda —is eternal. It reached the ear of Gautama Siddh ā rtha as it had those of the Rishis who had written i t down. He accepted the revelation, while rejecting the later overgrowth of Br ā hmanical thought and f ancy, and built His doctrines on one and the same basis of imperishable truth. As in the case of His Western successor, Gautama, the “Merciful,” the “Pure,” and the “Just,” was the first found in the Eastern Hierarchy of historical Adepts, if not in the world-annals of divine mortals, who was moved by that generous feeling which locks the whole of mankind within one embrace, with no petty differences of race, birth, or caste. It was He who first enunciated that grand and noble principle, and He again who first put it into practice. For the sake of the poor and the reviled, the outcast and the hapless, invited by Him to the king’s festival table, He had excluded those who had hitherto sat alone in haughty seclusion and selfishness, believing that they would be defiled by the very shadow of the disinherited ones of the land—and these non-spiritual Br ā hmans turned against Him f or that preference. Since then such as these have never forgiven the prince-beggar, the son of a king, who, forgetting His rank and station, had flung widely open the doors of the forbidden sanctuary to the pariah and the man of low estate, thus giving precedence to personal merit over hereditary rank or fortune. The sin was theirs—the cause nevertheless Himself: hence the “Merciful and the Blessed One” could not go out entirely from this world of illusion and created causes without atoning for the sin of all—therefore of these Brahmans also. If “man afflicted by man” found safe refuge with the Tath ā gata, “man a fflicting man” had also his share in His self-sacrificing, all-embracing and forgiving love.

The Bodhisattva became a Buddha and a Nirv ā n ī through personal effort and merit, after having had to undergo all the hardships of every other neophyte—not by virtue of a divine birth, as thought by some. It was only the reaching of Nirv ā Š a while still living in the body and on this earth that was due to His having been in previous births high on the “Path of Dzyan” (knowledge, wisdom). Mental or intellectual gifts and abstract knowledge follow an Initiate in his new birth, but he has to acquire phenomenal powers anew, passing through all the successive stages. He has to acquire Rinchen-na-dun (“the seven precious gifts”)† one after the other. During the period of meditation no worldly phenomena on the physical plane must be allowed to enter into his mind or cross his thoughts.

For, as Vajrasattva, He is simply the Tsovo (Chief) of the Dhy ā ni-Buddhas or Dhy ā ni-Chohans, and the Supreme Intelligence in the Second World; while as Vajradhara (Dorjechang), He is all that which was enumerated above. “These two are one, and yet two,” and over them is “Chang, the Supreme Unmanifested and Universal Wisdom that has no name.” As two in one, He (They) is the Power that subdued and conquered Evil from the beginning, allowing it to reign only over willing subjects on earth, and having no power over those who despise and hate it. Esoterically the allegory is easily understood; exoterically Vajradhara (Vajrasattva) is the God to whom all the evil spirits swore that they would not impede the propagation of the Good Law (Buddhism), and before whom all the demons tremble. Therefore, we say this dual personage has the same role assigned to it in canonical and dogmatic Tibetan Buddhism as have Jehovah and the Archangel Mikael, the Metatron of the Jewish Kabalists. This is easily shown. Mikael is “the angel of the face of God,” or he who represents his Master. “My face shall go with thee” (in English, “presence”), before the Israelites, says God to Moses ( Exodus xxxiii, 14). “The angel of my presence” (Hebrew: “of my face”) ( Isaiah lxiii, 9), etc. The Roman Catholics identify Christ with Mikael, who is also his ferouer, or “face” mystically. This is precisely the position of Vajradhara, or Vajrasattva, in Northern Buddhism. For the latter, in His Higher Self as Vajradhara (Dorjechang), is never manifested, except to the seven Dhy ā ni-Chohans, the primeval Builders. Esoterically, it is the Spirit of the “Seven” collectively, their seventh principle, or Ā tman. Exoterically, any amount of fables may be found in K ā la-Chakra, the most important work in the Gyut division of the Kanjur , the division of mystic knowledge.* Dorjechang (wisdom) Vajradhara, is said to live in the second Ar ū pa World, which connects him with Metatron, in the first world of pure –––––––––– * [See The Books of Kiu-te . . . . . by David Reigle.

In the exoteric texts (Hindu and Buddhist), the Gods churn the ocean to extract from it the Water of Life—Amrita—or the Elixir of Knowledge. In both the Dragon steals some of this, and is exiled from heaven by Vishnu, or Vajradhara, or the chief God, whatever may be his name. We find the same in the Book of Enoch , and it is poetized in St. John’s Revelation . And now the allegory, with all its fanciful ornamentations, has become a dogma! As will be found mentioned later, the Tibetan Lamaseries contain many secret and semi-secret volumes, detailing the lives of great Sages. Many of the statements in them are purposely confused, and in others the reader becomes bewildered, unless a clue be given him, by the use of one name to cover many individuals who follow the same line of teaching. Thus there is a succession of “living Buddhas,” and the name Buddha is given to teacher after teacher.

Neither had the latter any responsibility for the deed, whether sinful or otherwise. Therefore we do not see the point, since Karma cannot act unjustly.

The reader will remember the just-quoted words are what Buddha Sanggyas (or Pho) is alleged by the Tibetan Occultists to have taught: there are three eternal things in the Universe—the Law, Nirv ā Š a, and Space. The Buddhists of the Southern Church claim, on the other hand, that Buddha held only two things as eternal— Ā k ā \u0001 a and Nirv ā Š a. But Ā k ā \u0001 a being the same as Aditi,* and both being translated “Space,” there is no discrepancy so far, since Nirv ā Š a as well as Moksha, is a state. Then in both cases the great Kapilavastu Sage unifies the two, as well as the three, into one eternal Element, and ends by saying that even “that One is a M ā y ā ” to one who is not a Dang-ma, a perfectly purified Soul. The whole question hangs upon materialistic misconceptions and ignorance of Occult Metaphysics. To the man of Science who regards Space as simply a mental representation, a conception of something existing pro forma , and having no real being outside our mind, Space per se is verily an illusion. He may fill the boundless interstellar space with an “imaginary” ether, nevertheless Space for him is an abstraction. Most of the Metaphysicians of Europe are so wide of the mark, from the purely Occult standpoint, of a correct comprehension of “Space,” as are the Materialists, though the erroneous conceptions of both of course differ widely.

That which the world regards simply as cosmic Space, an abstract representation, the Hindu ¬ishi , the Chaldaean Magus, the Egyptian Hierophant held, each and all, as the one eternal Root of all, the playground of all the Forces in Nature. It is the fountainhead of all terrestrial life, and the abode of those (to us) invisible swarms of existences—of real beings, as of the shadows only thereof, conscious and unconscious, intelligent and senseless—that surround us on all sides, that interpenetrate the atoms of our Kosmos, and see us not, as we do not either see or sense them through our physical organisms.

The key to the Pythagorean dogmas is the key to every great Philosophy. It is the general formula of unity in multiplicity, the One evolving the many and pervading the All. It is the archaic doctrine of Emanation in a few words. Speusippus and Xenocrates held, like their great Master, Plato, that: The anima mundi , or world-soul, was not the Deity, but a manifestation. Those philosophers never conceived of the One as an animate nature . The original One did not exist , as we understand the term.† Not till he (it) had united with the many— emanated existence (the Monad and Duad) —was a being produced.

The two modern philosophers, Schopenhauer and von Hartmann, teach the same ideas. The Occultists say that: The psychic and ectenic forces, the “ideo-motor” and “electro-biological powers”; “latent thought,” and even “unconcious cerebration” theories can be condensed in two words: the Kabalistic ASTRAL LIGHT .|| Schopenhauer only synthesized all this by calling it Will, and contradicted the men of Science in their materialistic views, as von Hartmann did later on.

The visible effects of matter are but the effects of force. He concludes thereby that that which is now called matter is nothing but the aggregation of atomic forces, to express which the word matter is used; outside of that, for science matter is but a word void of sense.* As much, it is to be feared, as those other terms with which we are now concerned, “Space,” “Nirv ā Š a,” and so on. The bold theories and opinions expressed in Schopenhauer’s works differ widely from those of the majority of our orthodox scientists.† “In reality,” remarks this daring speculator, “there is neither matter nor spirit . . . . The tendency to gravitation in a stone is as unexplainable as thought in human brain.. If matter can—no one knows why—fall to the ground, then it can also—no one knows why—think. . . . . . . . As soon, even in mechanics, as we trespass beyond the purely mathematical, as soon as we reach the inscrutable, adhesion, gravitation,. . . we are faced by phenomena which are to our senses as mysterious as the WILL and THOUGHT in man—we find ourselves facing the incomprehensible, for such is every force in nature. Where is then that matter which you all pretend to know so well; and from which—being so familiar with it—you draw all your conclusions and explanations, and attribute to it all things? . . . That, which can be fully realized by our reason and senses, is but the superficial; they can never reach the true inner substance of things. Such was the opinion of Kant. If you consider that there is in a human head . . . some sort of a spirit‚ then you are obliged to concede the same to a stone. If your dead and utterly passive matter can manifest a tendency toward gravitation, or, like electricity, attract and repel, and send out sparks—then, as well as the brain, it can also think. In short, every particle of the so-called spirit, we can replace with an equivalent of matter, and every particle of matter replace with spirit. . . . Thus, it is not the Cartesian division of all things into matter and spirit that can ever be found philosophically exact; but only if we divide them into will and manifestation , which form of division has naught to do with the former, for it spiritualizes everything: all that, which is in the first instance real and objective—body and matter—it transforms into a representation, and every manifestation into will.”‡ The matter of science may be for all objective purposes a –––––––––– * Op. cit ., I, 59. † While they are to a great extent identical with those of Esoteric Buddhism, the Secret Doctrine of the East. ‡ Parerga and Paralipomena , II, pp. 89, 90.

A “system of atheism” it may be justly called, since it recognizes neither God nor Gods—least of all a Creator, as it entirely rejects creation.

Nirv ā Š a, as well as the Moksha of the Ved ā ntins, is regarded by most of the Orientalists as a synonym of annihilation; yet no more glaring injustice could be done, and this capital error must be pointed out and disproved.

Nirv ā Š a and Moksha, then, as said before, have their being in non-being, if such a paradox be permitted to illustrate the meaning the better. Nirv ā Š a, as some illustrious Orientalists have attempted to prove, does mean the “blowing-out”* of all sentient existence. It is like the flame of a candle burnt out to its last atom, and then suddenly extinguished. Quite so. Nevertheless, as the old Arhat N ā gasena affirmed before the king who taunted him: “Nirv ā Š a is ”—and Nirv ā Š a is eternal. But the Orientalists deny this, and say it is not so. In their opinion Nirv ā Š a is not a re-absorption in the Universal Force, not eternal bliss and rest, but it means literally “the blowing-out, the extinction, complete annihilation, and not absorption.” The La ‰ k ā vat ā ra [section] quoted in support of their arguments by some Sanskritists, and which gives the different interpretations of Nirv ā Š a by the T ī rthika-Br ā hmans, is no authority to one who goes to primeval sources for information, namely, to the Buddha who taught the doctrine.† As well quote the Ch ā rv ā ka Materialists in their support.

Ascend into thy former abode, O blessed Avat ā ra”; and if we add that this seems to us the very opposite of nihilism, we may be told that so far it may only prove a contradiction, one more discrepancy in the Buddhist faith.

In A Buddhist Catechism the question is asked: Are there any dogmas in Buddhism which we are required to accept on faith? A. No. we are earnestly enjoined to accept nothing whatever on faith; whether it be written in books, handed down from our ancestors, or taught by the sages. Our Lord Buddha has said that we must not believe in a thing said merely because it is said; nor in traditions because they have been handed down from antiquity; nor rumors, as such; nor writings by sages, because sages wrote them; nor fancies that we may suspect to have been inspired in us by a deva (that is, in presumed spiritual inspiration); nor from inferences drawn from some haphazard assumption we may have made; nor because of what seems an analogical necessity; nor on the mere authority of our teachers or masters. But we are to believe when the writing, doctrine, or saying is corroborated by our own reason and consciousness. “For this,” says he, in concluding, “I taught you not to believe merely because you have heard, but when you believed of your consciousness, then to act accordingly and abundantly.”* That Nirv ā Š a, or rather, that state in which we are in Nirv ā Š a, is quite the reverse of annihilation is suggested to us by our “reason and consciousness,” and that is sufficient for us personally.

He tells his readers that in the Zohar the first of the Seph ī r ō th† has a name the significance of which is “the Infinite ,” but which was translated indifferently by the Kabalists as “Ens” and “Non-Ens” (“Being” and “Non-Being”); a Being , inasmuch as it is the root and source of all other beings; Non-Being because it [Ain-Soph—the Boundless and the Causeless, the Unconscious and the Passive Principle] resembles nought else in the Universe. The author adds: This is the reason why St. Denis did not hesitate to call it nihil . “Nihil” therefore stands—even with some Christian theologians and thinkers, especially with the earlier ones who lived but a few removes from the profound Philosophy of the initiated Pagans—as a synonym for the impersonal, divine Principle, the Infinite All, which is no Being or thing—the Ain-Soph, the Parabrahman"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"of the Ved ā nta.

The “sweet singers” were called by that name because they were experts in Mantras.

The works of the Orientalists are full of the direct landmarks of Arhats (Adepts), possessed of thaumaturgic powers, but these are spoken of—whenever the subject cannot be avoided —with unconcealed scorn. Whether innocently ignorant of, or purposely ignoring, the importance of the Occult element and symbology in the various Religions they undertake to explain, short work is generally made of such passages, and they are left untranslated. In simple justice, however, it should be allowed that much as all such miracles may have been exaggerated by popular reverence and fancy, they are neither less credible nor less attested in “heathen” annals than are those of the numerous Christian Saints in the church chronicles. Both have an equal right to a place in their respective histories. If, after the beginning of persecution against Buddhism, the Arhats were no more heard of in India, it was because, their vows prohibiting retaliation, they had to leave the country and seek solitude and security in China, Tibet, Japan, and elsewhere. The sacerdotal powers of the Br ā hmans being at that time unlimited, the Simons and Apolloniuses of Buddhism had as much chance of recognition and appreciation by the Br ā hmanical Irenaeuses and Tertullians as had their successors in the Judaean and Roman worlds. It was a historical rehearsal of the dramas that were enacted centuries later in Christendom. As in the case of the so-called “Heresiarchs” of Christianity, it was not for rejecting the Vedas or the sacred Syllable that the Buddhist Arhats were persecuted, but for understanding too well the secret meaning of both. It was simply because their knowledge was regarded as dangerous and their presence in India unwelcome, that they had to emigrate. Nor were there a smaller number of Initiates among the Br ā hmans themselves. Even today one meets most wonderfully-gifted S ā dhus and Yogins, obliged to keep themselves unnoticed 430  BLAVATSKY: COLLECTED WRITINGS and in the shadow, not only owing to the absolute secrecy imposed upon them at their Initiation but also for fear of the Anglo-Indian tribunals and courts of law, wherein judges are determined to regard as charlatanry, imposition, and fraud the exhibition of, or claim to, any abnormal powers, and one may judge of the past by the present. Centuries after our era the Initiates of the inner temples and the Mathams (monastic communities) chose a superior council, presided over by an all-powerful Brahm- Ā tm ā , the Supreme Chief of all those Mah ā tmas. This pontificate could be exercised only by a Br ā hman who had reached a certain age, and he it was who was the sole guardian of the mystic formula, and he was the Hierophant who created great Adepts. He alone could explain the meaning of the sacred word, AUM, and of all the religious symbols and rites. And whosoever among those Initiates of the Supreme Degree revealed to a profane a single one of the truths, even the smallest of the secrets entrusted to him, had to die; and he who received the confidence was put to death. But there existed, and still exists to this day, a Word far surpassing the mysterious monosyllable, and which renders him who comes into possession of its key nearly the equal of Brahman. The Brahm ā tm ā s alone possess this key, and we know that to this day there are two great Initiates in Southern India who possess it. It can be passed only at death, for it is the “Lost Word.” No torture, no human power, could force its disclosure by a Br ā hman who knows it; and it is well guarded in Tibet. Yet this secrecy and this profound mystery are indeed disheartening, since they alone—the Initiates of India and Tibet —could thoroughly dissipate the thick mists hanging over the history of Occultism, and force its claims to be recognized. The Delphic injunction, “Know thyself,” seems for the few in this age. But the fault ought not to be laid at the door of the Adepts, who have done all that could be done, and have gone as far as Their rules permitted, to open the eyes of the world. Only, while the European shrinks from public obloquy and the ridicule unsparingly thrown on Occultists, the Asiatic is being discouraged by his own Pandits.

The same holds good for China and Tibet. Among the commandments of Tsong-kha-pa there is one that enjoins the Rahats (Arhats) to make an attempt to enlighten the world, including the “white barbarians,” every century, at a certain specified period of the cycle. Up to the present day none of these attempts has been very successful. Failure has followed failure. Have we to explain the fact by the light of a certain prophecy? It is said that up to the time when Pan-chhen-rin-po-chhe (the Great Jewel of Wisdom)* condescends to be reborn in the land of the Pelings (Westerners), and appearing as the Spiritual Conqueror (Chom-den-da), destroys the errors and ignorance of the ages, it will be of little use to try to uproot the misconceptions of Peling-pa (Europe): her sons will listen to no one. Another prophecy declares that the Secret Doctrine shall remain in all its purity in Bod-yul (Tibet), only to the day that it is kept free from foreign invasion. The very visits of Western natives, however friendly, would be baneful to the Tibetan populations. This is the true key to Tibetan exclusiveness.† ––––––––––––––––––––––– ————— * A title of the Tashi-lhunpo Lama. † [See Lucifer, Vol. XV, pp. 97-98 and B.C.W .

And what is the good of a virtuous life, full of privations and suffering, if the only result of it is to be annihilation at the end? If even the attainment of that supreme perfection which leads the Initiate to remember the whole series of his past lives, and to foresee that of the future ones, by the full development of that inner, divine eye in him, and to acquire the knowledge that unfolds the causes* of the ever-recurring cycles of existence, brings him finally to non-being, and nothing more— then the whole system is idiotic, and Epicureanism is far more philosophical than such Buddhism.

It really seems that so long as this great mystery remains a dead letter to the world of Western thinkers, and especially to the Orientalists, the less the latter undertake to explain it, the better for Truth. Of all the existing religious Philosophies, Buddhism is the least understood. The Lassens, Webers, Wassilyev, the Burnoufs and Juliens, and even such “eye-witnesses” of Tibetan Buddhism as Csoma de Körös and the Schlagintweits, have hitherto only added perplexity to confusion. None of these has ever received his information from a genuine Gelugpa source: all have judged Buddhism from the bits of knowledge picked up at Tibetan frontier lamaseries, in countries thickly populated by Bhutanese and Lepchas, Böns, and red-capped Dugpas, along the line of the Him ā layas. Hundreds of volumes p urchased from Buriats, Shamans, and Chinese Buddhists, have been read and translated, glossed and misinterpreted according to invariable custom. Esoteric Schools would cease to be worthy of their name were their literature and doctrines to become the property of even their profane co-religionists—still less of the Western public. This is simple common sense and logic. Nevertheless this is a fact which our Orientalists have ever refused to recognize: hence they have gone on, gravely discussing the relative merits and absurdities of idols, “soothsaying tables,” and “magical figures of Phurbu” on the “square tortoise.” None of these have anything to do with the real philosophical Buddhism of the Gelugpa, or even of the most educated among the Sakyapa and Kadampa sects. All such “plates” and sacrificial tables, Chinsreg magical circles, etc., were avowedly got from Sikkim, Bhutan, and Eastern Tibet, from Böns and Dugpas. Nevertheless, these are given as characteristics of Tibetan Buddhism!

It is quite true that the primitive ® r ā vakas (listeners or hearers) and the ® ramaŠas (the “thought-restrainers” and the “pure”) have degenerated, and that many Buddhist sects have fallen into mere dogmatism and ritualism. Like every other Esoteric, half-suppressed teaching, the words of the Buddha convey a double meaning, and every sect has gradually come to claim to be the only one knowing the correct meaning, and thus to assume supremacy over the rest. Schism has crept in, and has fastened, like a hideous cancer, on the fair body of early Buddhism.

The “Eye Doctrine” means dogma and dead-letter form, church ritualism intended for those who are content with exoteric formulae. The “Heart Doctrine,” or the “Heart’s Seal” (the Sin Yin) is the only real one. This may be found corroborated by Hiuen Tsang. In his translation of Mah ā -Praj ńā -P ā ramit ā ( Ta-poh-je-King ), in one hundred and twenty volumes, it is stated that it was Buddha’s “favourite disciple Ananda,” who, after his great Master had gone into Nirv ā Š a, was commissioned by K ā syapa to promulgate “the Eye of the Doctrine,” the “Heart” of the Law having been left with the Arhats alone. The essential difference that exists between the two—the “Eye” and the “Heart,” or the outward form and the hidden meaning, the cold metaphysics and the Divine Wisdom—is clearly demonstrated in several volumes on “Chinese Buddhism,” written by sundry missionaries. Having lived for years in China, they still know no more than they have learned from pretentious schools calling themselves esoteric, yet freely supplying the open enemies of their faith with professedly ancient manuscripts and esoteric works! This ludicrous contradiction between profession and practice has never, as it seems, struck any of the western and reverend historians of other people’s secret tenets.

Bodhidharma brought from the Western heaven [Shamballa] the “seal of truth” (true seal), and opened the fountain of contemplation in the East.

No profane ears having heard the mighty Chau-yan [secret and enlightening precepts ] of Wu-Wei-chen-jen [Buddha within Buddha],* of our beloved Lord and Bodhisattva, how can one tell what his thoughts really were?
