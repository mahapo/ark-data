[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE ORIGIN OF EVIL by H. P. Blavatsky originally published in Lucifer, October, 1887 and reproduced as an Adyar Pamphlet No. 78 - June 1917 by Theosophical Publishing Ho use, Adyar, Madras, India T HE problem of the origin of evil can be philos ophically approached only if the archaic Indian formula is taken as t he basis of the argument. Ancient wisdom alone solves the presence of the universal fi end in a satisfactory way. It attributes the birth of Kosmos and the evolution of life to the breaking asunder of the primordial, manifested U NITY , into plurality, or the great illusion of form. H OMOGENEITY having transformed itself into Heterogeneity, contrasts have naturally been created; henc e sprang what we call E VIL , which thenceforward reigned supreme in this \"Vale of Tears.\" Materialistic Western philosophy (so misnam ed) has not failed to profit by this grand metaphysical tenet. Even physical Sci ence, with Chemistry at its head, has turned its attention of late to the first proposition, and directs its efforts toward proving on irrefutable data the homogeneity of primordi al matter. But now steps in materialistic Pessimism, a teaching which is neither philosophy nor science, but only a deluge of meaning less words. Pessimism, in its latest development, having ceased to be pantheistic, having wed ded itself to materialism, prepares to make capital out of the old Indian formu la. But the atheistic pessimist soars no higher than the terrestrial homogeneous pl asm of the Darwinists. For him the ultima Thule is earth and matter, and he sees, beyond the prima materia, only an ugly void, an empty nothingness. Some of the pessimists attempt to poetize their idea after the manner of the whitened se pulchres, or the Mexican corpses, whose ghastly cheeks and lips are thickl y covered with rouge. The decay of matter pierces through the mask of seem ing life, all efforts to the contrary notwithstanding. Materialism patronizes Indian metaphor and imagery now. In a new work upon the subject by Dr. Mainländer, \" Pessimism and Progress ,\" one learns that Indian Pantheism and German Pessimism are identical; and that it is t he breaking up of homogeneous matter into heterogeneous materi al, the transition from uniformity to multiformity, which resulted in so unhappy a universe. Saith Pessimism: This [transition] is precisely the original mistake, the primordial sin, which the whole creation has now to expiate by heavy suffering; it is just that sin, which, having launched into existence all that lives, plunged it thereby into the abysm al depths of evil and misery, to escape from which there is but one means possible, i.e., by putting an end to being itself. This interpretation of the Eastern formula , attributing to it the first idea of escaping the misery of life by \"pu tting an end to being\"--whether that being is"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"viewed as applicable to the whole Kosmos, or only to individual life--is a gross misconception. The Easter n pantheist, whose philosophy teaches him to discriminate between Being or E SSE and conditioned exist ence, would hardly indulge in so absurd an idea as the postulation of such an alternative. He knows he can put an end to form alone, not to being-- and that only on this plane of terrestrial illusion. True, he knows that by killing out in himself Tanha (the unsatisfied desire for existence, or the \"will to live\")--he will thus gradually escape the curse of rebirth and con ditioned existence. But he knows also that he cannot kill, or \"put an end,\" even to his own little life except as a personality, which after all is but a change of dress. And believing but in One R eality, which is eternal Be- ness, the \"causeless C AUSE \" from which he has exiled himself into a world of forms, he regards the temporar y and progressing manifestati ons of it in the state of Mâyâ (change or illusion), as the greatest evil, truly; but at the same time as a process in nature, as unavoi dable as are the pangs of bi rth. It is the only means by which he can pass from limited and condi tioned lives of sorrow into eternal life, or into that absolut e \"Be-ness,\" which is so gr aphically expressed in the Sanskrit word sat. The \"pessimism\" of the Hi ndu or Buddhist pantheist is metaphysical, abstruse, and philosophical. The idea that matter and its Protean manifestations are the source and origin of universal evil and sorrow is a very old one, though Gautama Buddha was the first to give it its def inite expression. Bu t the great Indian Reformer assuredly never meant to make of it a handle for the modern pessimist to get hold of, or a peg for the materi alist to hang his distorted and pernicious tenets     upon!          The Sage and Philosopher, who sacr ificed himself for Humanity by living for it, in order to save it, by teaching men to see in the sensuous existence of matter misery alone, had never in his deep philo sophical mind any idea of offering a premium for suicide; his efforts were to release mankind from too strong an attachment to life, which is the chief cause of Selfishness-- hence the creator of mutual pain and suffering. In his pers onal case, Buddha left us an example of fortitude to follow; in living, not in running away from life. His doctrine shows evil immanent, not in matter, which is eternal, but in the illusions created by it: through the changes and transformations of matter generating life--because these changes are condition ed and such life is ephemeral. At the same time those evils are shown to be not only unavoi dable, but necessary. For if we would discern good from evil, light from darkness, and appreciate the former, we can do so only through the contra sts between the two. While Buddha's philosophy points, in its dead-letter meaning, only to th e dark side of things on this illusive plane; its esotericism, the hidden soul of it, draws the veil aside and reveals to the Arhat all the glories of L IFE E TERNAL in all the Homogeneousness of Consciousness and Being. Another absurdity, no dou bt, in the eyes of materialistic science and even modern Idealism, yet a fact to the Sage and esoteric pantheist. Nevertheless, the root i dea that evil is born and generat ed by the ever increasing complications of the homogeneous mate rial, which enters into form and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"differentiates more and more as that fo rm becomes physically more perfect, has an esoteric side to it which seems to have never occurred to the modern pessimist. Its dead-letter aspect, however, became the subject of speculation with every ancient thinking nation. Even in I ndia the primitive thought, underlying the formula already cited, has been disf igured by Sectarianism, and has led to the ritualistic, purely dogmatic observances of the Hatha Yogis, in contradistinction to t he philosophical Vedantic Raja Yoga. Pagan and Christian exoteric speculation, and ev en mediæval monastic asceticism, have extracted all they could from the origina lly noble idea, and made it subservient to their narrow- minded sectarian views. Their false conceptions of matter have led the Christians from the earliest day to i dentify woman with Evil and matter--notwithstanding the worship paid by the Roman Cat holic Church to the Virgin. But the latest application of the mis understood Indian formula by the pessimists in Germany is quite original, and rather unexpected, as we shall see. To draw any analogy between a highly metaphysi cal teaching, and Darwin's theory of physical evolution would, in itself, seem rather a hopeless task. The more so as the theory of natural select ion does not preach any conceivable extermination of being, but, on the contrary, a continuous and ever increasing development of life. Nevertheless, German ingenuity has contri ved, by means of scientific paradoxes and much sophistry, to give it a semblanc e of philosophical truth. The old Indian tenet itself has not esc aped litigation at t he hands of modem pessimism. The happy discoverer of the theory, that the origin of evil dates from the protoplasmic Amoeba, which divided itself for procreation, and thus lost its immaculate homogeneity, has laid claim to the Aryan archaic formula in his new volume. While extolling its philosophy and the de pth of ancient conceptions, he declares that it ought to be viewed \"as the most profound truth precogitated and robbed by the ancient sages fr om modern thought\"! It thus follows that the deep ly religious pantheism of the Hindu and Buddhist philosopher, and the occasional vagaries of the pessimistic materialist, are placed on the same level and identifi ed by \"modern thought.\" The impassable chasm between the two is ignor ed. It matters little, it s eems, that the pantheist, recognizing no reality in the manifested Kosmos, and regarding it as a simple illusion of his senses, has to view his ow n existence also as only a bundle of illusions. When, therefore, he speaks of the means of escaping from the sufferings of objective life, his view of those sufferings, and his motive for putting an end to existence are entirely different fr om those of the pessimistic materialist. For him, pain as well as sorrow are illusion s, due to attachment to this life, and ignorance. Therefore he strives after eternal, changeless life, and absolute consciousness in the state of Nirvana; whereas the European pessimist, taking the \"evils\" of life as realities, aspires - when he has the time to aspire after anything except those said mundane realities, - to annihilation of \"being,\" as he expresses it. For the philosopher there is but one real life, Nirvanic bliss, which is a state differing in kind, not in degree only , from that of any of the planes of consciousness in the manifested univers e. The pessimist calls \"Nirvana\" superstition, and explains it as \"cessati on of life,\" life for him beginning and ending on earth. The former ignores in his spiritual aspirations even the integral"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"homogeneous unit, of which the German pessi mist now makes such capital. He knows of, and believes in only the direct cause of that unit, eternal and ever living, because the O NE uncreated, or rather not evoluted. Hence all his efforts are directed toward the speediest r eunion possible with, and return to his pre - primordial condition, after his pilgrimage through this ill usive series of visionary lives, with their unreal phantasmagor ia of sensuous perceptions. Such pantheism can be qualified as \"pessimi stic\" only by a believer in a personal Providence; by one who contra sts its negation of the rea lity of anything \"created\"- - i.e., conditioned and limited-- with his own blind unphilosophical faith. The Oriental mind does not busy itself with extracting evil from ev ery radical law and manifestation of life, and multiplying every phenomenal quantity by the units of very often imaginary evils: the Eastern panthei st simply submits to the inevitable, and tries to blot out from his path in life as many \"descents into rebirth\" as he can, by avoiding the creation of new karmic causes. The Buddhist philosopher knows that the duration of the series of lives of every human being--unless he reaches Nirvana \"artificially\" (\"takes the kingdom of God by violence,\" in Kabalistic parlance)--is giv en, allegorically in the forty-nine days passed by Gautama the Buddha under th e Bo-tree. And the Hindu sage is aware, in his turn, that he has to light the first, and extinguish the forty-ninth fire [ This is an esoteric tenet, and the general reader will not make much out of it. But the Theosophist who has read Esoteric Buddhism may compute the 7 by 7 of the forty-nine \"days\" and the forty-nine \"fires,\" and understand that the allegory refers esoterically to the seven human cons ecutive root-races with their seven subdivisions. Every monad is born in the fi rst and obtains deliverance in the last seventh race. Only a \"Buddha\" is shown re aching it during the c ourse of one life. ] before he reaches his final deliveran ce. Knowing this, both sage and philosopher wait patiently for the natur al hour of deliverance; whereas their unlucky copyist, the European pessimist, is ever ready to commit, as to preach, suicide. Ignorant of the numberless heads of the hydra of existences, he is incapable of feeling the same philosophica l scorn for life as he does for death, and of, thereby, following the wise example given him by his Oriental brother. Thus, philosophic pantheism is very different from modern pessimism. The first is based upon the correct underst anding of the mysteries of being; the latter is in reality only one more system of evil adde d by unhealthy fancy to the already large sum of real social evils. In sober truth it is no philosophy, but simply a systematic slander of life and being; the bilious utter ances of a dyspeptic or an incurable hypochondriac. No parallel ca n ever be attempted between the two systems of thought. The seeds of evil and sorro w were indeed the earliest result and consequence of the heterogeneity of the manifested univers e. Still they are but an illusion produced by the law of contra sts, which, as described, is a fundamental law in nature. Neither good nor evil would exist were it not for the light they mutually throw on each other. Being, under whatever form, having been observed from the World's creation to offer these co ntrasts, and evil pr edominating in the universe owing to Ego -ship or selfishness, the rich Oriental metaphor has pointed to existence as expiating the mistake of nature; and the human soul (psüche),"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"was henceforth regarded as t he scapegoat and victim of unconscious OVERSOUL . But it is not to Pessimism, but to Wisdom that it gave birth. Ignorance alone is the willing martyr, but k nowledge is the master of natural pessimism. Gradually, and by the process of heredity or atavism, the latter became innate in man. It is always present in us, howsoever latent and silent its voice in the beginning. Amid the early joys of existence, when we are still full of the vital energies of youth, we are yet ap t, each of us, at the first pang of sorrow, after a failure, or at the sudden a ppearance of a black cloud, to accuse life of it; to feel life a burden, and often curse our being. This shows pessimism in our blood, but at the same time the presence of the fruits of ignorance. As mankind multiplies, and with it suffering - which is the natural result of an increasing number of units that generate it - sorrow and pain are intensifie d. We live in an atmosphere of gloom and despair, but this is because our eyes are downcast and riveted to the earth, with all its physi cal and grossly material manifestations. If, instead of that, man, proceeding on hi s life-journey looked--not heavenward, which is but a figure of speech--but within himself and centered his point of observation on the inner man, he would soon escape fr om the coils of the great serpent of illusion. From the cradle to the grave, his life would then become supportable and worth living, even in its worst phases. Pessimism - that chronic suspicion of lu rking evil everywhere - is thus of a two- fold nature, and brings fruits of two kinds. It is a natural characteristic in physical man, and becomes a curse only to the i gnorant. It is a boon to the spiritual, inasmuch as it makes the latter turn in to the right path, and brings him to the discovery of another as fundamental a truth; namely, that all in this world is only preparatory because transitory. It is like a chink in the dark prison walls of earth- life, through which breaks in a ray of light from the eternal home, which, illuminating the inner senses, whispers to the prisoner in his shell of clay of the origin and the dual myst ery of our being. At the same time, it is a tacit proof of the presence in man of that which knows, without being told, viz:-- that there is another and a better life, once that the curs e of earth-lives is lived through. This explanation of the problem and origin of evil being, as already said, of an entirely metaphysical charac ter, has nothing to do wit h physical laws. Belonging as it does altogether to the spiritual part of man, to dabble with it superficially is, therefore, far more dangerous than to remain ignorant of i t. For, as it lies at the very root of Gautama Buddha's ethics, and since it has now fallen into the hands of the modern Philistines of materialism, to c onfuse the two systems of \"pessimistic\" thought can lead bu t to mental suicide, if it does not lead to worse. Eastern wisdom teaches that spirit has to pass through the ordeal of incarnation and life, and be baptised with matter befo re it can reac h experience and knowledge. After which only it receives the baptism of soul, or self- consciousness, and may return to its original condition of a god, plus experience, ending with omniscience. In other words, it can return to the original state of the homogeneity of primordial essence only through the ad dition of the fruitage of Karma, which alone is able to create an absolute conscious deity, removed but one degree from the absolute A LL."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Even according to the letter of the Bible, evil must have existed before Adam and Eve, who, therefore, are i nnocent of the slander of the original sin had there been no evil or sin before them, there could exist neither tempting Serpent nor a Tree of Knowledge of good and evil in Eden. The characterist ics of that apple-tree are shown in the verse when the couple had tasted of its fruit: \"The eyes of them both were opened, and they knew\" many things besides knowing they were naked. Too much knowledge about things of matter is thus rightly shown an evil. But so it is, and it is our duty to examine and combat the new pernicious theory. Hitherto, pessimism was kept in the regions of philo sophy and metaphysics, and showed no pretensions to intrude into the domain of purely physical science, such as Darwinism. The theory of evol ution has become almost universal now, and there is no school (save the Sunday an d missionary schools) where it is not taught, with more or less modifications from the original progr amme. On the other hand, there is no other teaching more abused and taken advantage of than evolution, especially by t he application of its fundamental laws to the solution of the most compound and abstract problem s of man's many-sided existence. There, where psychology and even philosophy \"fear to tread,\" materialistic biology applies its sledge-hammer of superficial analog ies and prejudged conclusions. Worse than all, claiming man to be only a higher animal, it maintains this right as undeniably pertaining to the domain of the science of evolution. Paradoxes in those \"dom ains\" do not rain now, they pour. As \"man is the measure of all things,\" therefore is man measured and analys ed by the animal. One German materialist claims spiritual and psychic evolution as the lawful property of physiology and bi ology; the mysteries of embryology and zoology alone, it is said, being c apable of solving those of consciousness in man and the origin of his soul [ Haeckel. ] Another finds justification for suicide in the example of animals, who, when tired of living, put an end to existence by starvation [ Leo Bach. ] Hitherto pessimism, notwithstanding th e abundance and br illiancy of its paradoxes, had a weak point - namely, the absence of any real and evident basis for it to rest upon. Its followers had no living, guiding thought to serve them as a beacon and help them to steer clear of the sandbanks of life--real and imaginary- -so profusely sown by themselves in the shape of denunciations against life and being. All they could do was to rely upo n their representatives, who occupied their time very ingeniously if not profit ably, in tacking the many and various evils of life to the metaphysical propositio ns of great German thinkers, like Schopenhauer and Hart mann, as small boys tack on col oured tails to the kites of their elders and rejoice at seeing them launched in the air. But now the programme will be changed. The pessimist s have found something more solid and authoritative, if less philosophical, to tack their jeremiads and dirges to, than the metaphysical kites of Schopenhauer. The day when they agreed with the views of this philosopher, wh ich pointed at the Universal W ILL as the perpetrator of all the World-evil, is gone to retu rn no more. Nor will they be any better satisfied with the hazy \"Unconscious\" of von Hartmann. They have been seeking diligently for a more congenial and le ss metaphysical soil to build their pessimistic philosophy upon, and they have been rewa rded with success, now"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"that the cause of Universal Sufferi ng has been discovered by them in the fundamental laws of physical development. Evil will no longer be allied with the misty and uncertain Phantom called \"W ILL ,\" but with an actual and obvious fact: the pessimists will henceforth be towed by the Evolutionists. The basic argument of their represent ative has been given in the opening sentence of this article. The Universe and all on it appeared in consequence of the \"breaking asunder of U NITY into Plurality.\" This rather dim rendering of the Indian formula is not made to refer, as I have shown, in the mind of the pessimist, to the one Unity, to the Ve dantin abstraction - -Parab rahm: otherwise, I should not certainly have used the words \"breakin g up.\" Nor does it concern itself much with Mulaprakrti, or the \"V eil\" of Parabrahm; nor even with the first manifested primordial matter, except inferentially, as follows from Dr. Mainländer's exposition, but chiefl y with the terrestrial protoplasm. Spirit or deity is entirely ignored in this case; evident ly because of the necessity for showing the whole as \"the lawful domain of physical Science.\" In short, the time-honoured formula is clai med to have its basis and to find its justification in the theory that from \"a few, perhaps one, single form of the very simplest nature\" (Darwin), \"all the diffe rent animals and plants living to-day, and all the organisms t hat have ever lived on the earth,\" have gradually developed. It is this axiom of Science, we are told , which justifies and demonstrates the Hindu philosophical tenet. What is this axiom? Wh y, it is this: Science teaches that the series of transformations through which the seed is made to pass--the seed that grows into a tree, or becomes an ovum, or that which develops into an animal-- consists in every case in nothing but the passage of the fa bric of that seed, from the homogeneous into the hete rogeneous or compound fo rm. This is then the scientific verity which checks the Indian fo rmula by that of the Evolutionists, identifies both, and thus exalts ancient wisdom by recognizing it worthy of modern materialistic thought. This philosophical formula is not simply corroborated by the individual growth and development of isolated species, explains our pessimist; but it is demonstrated in general as in detail. It is shown justif ied in the evolution and growth of the Universe as well as in t hat of our planet. In short, the birth, growth and development of the whole or ganic world in its integral totality, are there to demonstrate ancient wisdom. From the uni versals down to the particulars, the organic world is discovered to be subject to the same law of ever increasing elaboration, of the transition from unity to plurality as \"the f undamental formula of the evolution of life.\" Even the growth of nations, of so cial life, public institutions, the development of the lan guages, arts and sciences, - all this follows inevitably and fatally the all-embracing law of \"the breaking asunder of unity into plurality, and the passage of the homogeneous into multiformity.\" But while following Indian wisdom, our aut hor exaggerates this fundamental law in his own way, and distorts it. He brings this law to bear even on the historical destinies of mankind. He makes these destinies subservient to, and a proof of, the correctness of the Indian conception.  He maintains that humanity as an integral whole, in proportion as it develops and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"progresses in its evolution, and separates in its parts - each becoming a distinct and independent branch of the unit - drifts more and more away from its original healthy, harmonious unity. The complicati ons of social establishment, social relations, as those of individuality, all le ad to the weakening of the vital power, the relaxation of the energy of feeling, and to the destruction of that integral unity, without which no inner harmony is possi ble. The absence of that harmony generates an inner discord which becomes the cause of the greatest mental misery. Evil has its roots in the very nature of the evolution of life and its complications. Every one of it s steps forward is at the same time a step taken toward the dissolution of its energy, and leads to passive apathy. Such is the inevitable result, he says, of every progressive complication of life; because evolution or development is a tr ansition from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, a scattering of th e whole into the many, et c., etc. The terrible law is universal and applies to all creation, fr om the infinitesimally small up to man for, as he says, it is a fundamental law of nature. Now, it is just in this one-sided view of physical nature, wh ich the German author accepts without one single thought as to its spiritual and psychic aspect, that his school is doomed to certain failure. It is not a question whether the said law of differentiation and its fatal consequences ma y or may not apply, in certain cases, to the growth and development of the animal species, and even of man; but simply, since it is the basis and main support of the whol e new theory of the pessimistic school, whether it is really a universal and fundamental law? We want to know whether this basic formula of evolution embraces t he whole process of development and growth in it s entirety; and whet her, indeed, it is within the domain of physical science or not. If it is \"nothing else than the transition from the homogeneous state to the heterogeneous,\" as says Mainländer, then it remains to be proved that the given process \"pro duces that complicated combination of tissues and organs which forms and completes the perfect animal and plant.\" As remarked already by some critics on \"Pessimism and Progr ess,\" the German pessimist does not doubt it for one mo ment. His supposed discovery and teaching \"rest wholly on his certitude t hat development and the fundamental law of the complicated proce ss of organization repres ent but one thing: the transformation of unity into plurality.\" Henc e the identification of the process with dissolution and decay, and the weakening of all the forces and energies. Mainländer would be right in his analogies were this la w of the differentiation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous to really represent the fundamental law of the evolution of life. But the idea is quite erroneous - metaphysically as well as physically. Evolution does not proceed in a straight line; no more than any other process in nat ure, but journeys on cyclically, as does all the rest. The cyclic serpents swallow their tails like the Serpent of Eternity. And it is in this that the Indian formula, which is a Secret Doct rine teaching, is indeed corroborated by the natural Sciences, and especially by biology. This is what we read in the \" Scientific Letters \" by an anonymous Russian author and critic:"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"In the evolution of isolated indivi duals, in the evolution of the organic world, in that of the Un iverse, as in the growth and development of our planet--in short wherever any of the processes of progressive complexity take place, there we find, apart from the transition from unity to plura lity, and homogeneity to heterogeneity, a converse transformation--the trans ition front plurality to unity, from the heterogeneous to the homogeneous. . . . Minute observation of the given process of progressive complexity has shown, that what takes place in it is not alone the separation of parts, but also their mutual absorpti on. . . . While one portion of the cells merge into each other an d unite into one uniform whole. forming muscular fibres, muscular tissue, others are absorbed in the bone and nerve tissues, etc., et c. The same take place in the formation of plants. . . . In this case material nature repeats the law that acts in the evolution of the psychic and the spiritual: both descend but to reascend and merge at the starting-point. The homogeneous formative mass or element differentiated in its parts, is gradually transformed into t he heterogeneous; then, me rging those parts into a harmonious whole, it recommences a converse process, or reinvolution, and returns as gradually into its pr imitive or primordial state. Nor does Pessimism find any better support in pure Materialism, as hitherto the latter has been tinged with a decidedly op timistic bias. Its leading advocates have, indeed, never hesitated to sneer at the theological adoration of the \"glory of God and all his works.\" Büchner flings a taunt at the pantheist who sees in so \"mad and bad\" a world the mani festation of the Absolute. But, on the whole, the materialists admit a balance of good over evil, perhaps as a buffer against any \"superstitious\" tendency to look out and ho pe for a better one. Narrow as is their outlook, and limited as is their spiritual horizon, they yet see no cause to despair of the drift of things in general. The pantheistic pessimists, however, have never ceased to urge that a despair of conscious being is the only legitimate outcome of atheistic negation. This op inion is, of course, axiomati c, or ought to be so. If \"in this life only is there hope,\" the tragedy of life is absolutely without any raison d'être and a perpetuation of the drama is as foolish as it is futile. The fact that the conclusions of pessimism have been at last assimilated by a certain class of atheistic writers, is a st riking feature of t he day, and another sign of the times. It illustrates the truism that the void cr eated by modern scientific negation cannot and never can be filled by the cold prospects offered as a solatium to optimists. The Comtean \"enthusiasm of Humanity\" is a poor thing enough with annihilation of the Race to ensue \"as the solar fires die slowly out\"-- if, indeed, they do die at all--to please physical scien ce at the computed time. If all present sorrow and suffering, the fier ce struggle for exis tence and all its attendant horrors, go for nothi ng in the long run, if MAN is a mere ephemeron, the sport of blind forces, why assist in t he perpetuation of the farce? The \"ceaseless grind of matter, force and la w,\" will but hurry the swa rming human millions into eternal oblivion, and ultimately leave no trace or memory of the past, when things"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"return to the nebulosity of the fire-mist, whence they em erged.

One thing is, however, clear: the absolut e necessity for some solution, which embraces the facts of existence on an optimistic basis. Modern Society is permeated with an increasing cynicism and honeycombed with disgust of life. This is the result of an utter ignorance of the operations of Karma and the nature of Soul evolution. It is from a mistak en allegiance to the dogmas of a mechanical and largely spurious theory of Evolution, that Pessimism has risen to such undue importance. Once the basis of the Gr eat Law is grasped - and what philosophy can furnish better means for such a grasp and final solution, than the esoteric doctrine of the great Indian Sage s? - there remains no possible locus standi for the recent amendments to the Schop enhauerian system of thought or the metaphysical subtleties, woven by the \"philosopher of the Unconscious.\" The reasonableness of conscious Existence can be proved on ly by the study of the primeval--now esoteric--philos ophy.
