P. Blavatsky gives a legend of a Sacred Island -- also quoted in The Secret Doctrine , Volume 2, page 220. This island rested in a vast inland sea, which extended over Middle Asia north of the proud Himalayan range, where now are desolate barren wastes. The ancient isle had no rival in the world for beauty. Some thousands of years B.C., this lovely spot was the home of the Sons of Wisdom -- the undying race -- who had escaped from the great deluge. In the legend it is known as the Garden of Eden, of which, it is said, all subsequent Edens are but the reminiscence. There is a tradition that this island exists to the present day as an oasis, surrounded by the dreadful wildernesses of the great Gobi desert, whose sands no foot hath crossed in the memory of man. There dwelt the Sons of Wisdom. As to Enoch, Thoth or Hermes, Orpheu s and Kadmos, these are all generic names, branches and offshoots of the seven primordial sages (incarnated Dhyan - Chohans or Devas, in illusive , not mortal bodies), who taught Humanity all it knew, and whose earliest disciples assumed their master's names. This custom passed from the Fourth to the Fifth Race. Hence the sameness of the traditions about Hermes . . . Enoch, etc., they are all inventors of letters; none of them dies but still lives, and they are the first Initiators into, and Founders of the My steries. -- The Secret Doctrine 2: 267n Alone a handful of primitive men . . . remained the elect custodians of the Mysteries revealed to mankind by the divine Teachers. . . . these Elect were the germ of a Hierarchy which never died since that period : . . . . Though unseen they are ever present . When people say of one of them , \" He is dead \"; behold , he is alive and under another form . These are the Head , the Heart , the Soul , and the Seed of undying knowledge. . . . Thou shalt never speak, O Lanoo, of these great ones . . . before a multitude , mentioning them by their names . The Wise alone will understand. . . . -- 2: 281 - 2 The gradual evolution of man in the Secret Doctrine shows that all the later . . . Races have their physical origin in the early Fourth Race. But it is the sub - race, which preceded the one that separated sexually, that is to be regarded as the spiritual ancestors of our present generations, and especially of the Eastern Aryan Races. -- II, 165n The Garden of Eden, then, as a locality, is no myth at all, but as said, there have been several Edens. it is really from the Euxine to Kashmir and beyond, that science has to search for the cradle -- or rather one of the chief cradles -- of mankind and the sons of Ad - ah; and especially in after t imes, when the Garden of Ed - en on the Euphrates became the college of the astronomers and magi, the Aleim. But this 'college' and this Eden belong to the Fifth Race, and are simply a faint reminiscence of the Adi - varsha, of the primeval Third Race. -- 2: 203 In the long transition period when the methods of reproduction were changing, the animals separated into two sexes first. By degrees this transformation occurred in the human stage. But the mindless men, those who had received no \"spark,\" the \"narrow - headed\" spoken of in Chapter V, crossed with the animals -- a possible thing"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 3 in the very early steps of evolution. Stanza VIII, verse 32, of The Book of Dzyan , quoted in The Secret Doctrine , 2: 184, reads: And those which had no spark (the \" narrow - brained \") took huge she - animals unto them. They begat upon them dumb races. Dumb they were ( the \" narrow brained \") themselves. But their tongues untied. The tongues of their progeny remained still. Monsters they bred. A race of crooked, red - hair - covered monsters, going on all fours. A dumb race, to keep the shame untold. This unnatural progeny, which cannot be compared to anything existing today, are the ancestors of the anthropoids, so puzzling to science. We are now at a place in the history where it is possible to understand the allusions made several times to exceptions to the rule that no monads enter the human stage after the middle point on this globe, namely, during the fourth race. For this dumb race was partly human. The event was the first physical \"fall into matter\" of the lower races which, however, being mindless, were irresponsible. The results of the mistake -- for such it was -- had to fall on the Sons of Wisdom, who had refused to incarnate earlier, and yet were responsible for the coming humanity. Stanza IX reads as follows: 33. Seeing which ( the sin committed with the animals ), the Lhas ( the Spirits , the \" Sons of Wisdom \") who had not built men ( who had refused to create ), wept, saying: -- 34. \"The Amanasa ( the ' mindless ') have defiled our future abodes. This is Karma. Let us dwell in the others. Let us teach them better, lest worse should happen.\" They did. . . . 35. Then all became endowed with Manas (minds). They saw the sin of the mindless. -- 2: 191 By degrees the men themselves as time unfo lded their natures realized the unfitness -- we must not say sin -- of what they had done, only when too late; after the angelic monads from higher spheres had incarnated in, and endowed them with understanding. To that day they had remained simply physic al, like the animals generated from them. For what is the distinction? The doctrine teaches that the only difference between animate and inanimate objects on earth, between an animal and a human frame, is that in some the various \"fires\" are latent and in others they are active. The vital fires are in all things and not an atom is devoid of them. But no animal has the three higher principles awakened in him; they are simply potential, latent, and thus non - existing . And so would the animal frames of men be t o this day, had they been left as they came out from the bodies of their Progenitors, whose shadows they were, to grow, unfolded only by the powers and forces immanent in matter. -- 2: 267 H. P. Blavatsky comments on the Stanzas to the effect that, though sinning unconsciously, this seventh degenerate race will have to bide its time for final development, but will find itself on the last day , on one of the seven paths. But the journey is fraught with difficulties for those Sons of Wisdom who thus deferred incarnation. -- these had their Karmic punishment prepared for them. They got bodies (physiologically) inferior to their astral models, because their chhayas had belonged to progenitors of an inferior degree in the seven classes. As to those \"Sons of Wis dom\" who had \"deferred\" their incarnation till the Fourth Race, which was already tainted (physiologically) with sin and impurity, they produced a terrible cause, the Karmic result of which weighs on them to this day. It was"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 4 produced in themselves, and the y became the carriers of that seed of iniquity for aeons to come, because the bodies they had to inform had become defiled through their own procrastination. -- 2: 228 This mistake, then, was the origin of the much discussed race of anthropoid apes, and t he history of the event shows the fallacy of the so - called Darwinian doctrine. Blavatsky points out that the embryo of man has no more of the ape in it than of any other mammal, but contains in itself the totality of the kingdoms of nature , -- 2: 259 tho ugh -- It is not denied that in the preceding Round man was a gigantic ape - like creature; and when we say \"man\" we ought perhaps to say, the rough - mold that was developing for the use of man in this Round only. -- 2: 261 What we now see as apes are the m uch - changed descendants of that early animal - human progeny. They form the exception so often spoken of, and will become men of a lower order in the next or fifth round. It is interesting to note here that science is beginning to corroborate to a degree th e ancient teachings on this subject. The puzzle and mystery of the simian races can, of course, never be unraveled by the methods of investigation at present used by scientists. Only a study of the archaic records can reveal the real facts. But the careful , patient, persevering, and truly remarkable researches of scholars working in this direction, are gradually undermining the Darwinian theory. In high scientific quarters it is asserted that there is no evidence of its truth, but that inference can reach n o further than to suspect man and ape as representing separate branches of the same original stock. Evidence has been produced to prove man anterior to the ape -- all of which opens the door for the acceptance of this ancient teaching, so simple and compre hensive. Dr. G. de Purucker's book, Man in Evolution , presents facts from the anatomical and biological standpoint which annihilate the old Darwinian theory. The mistakes of those early days did not end with the mindless race. The third race merged into t he fourth, growing more and more material; during which transition certain groups showed their loss of spirituality by becoming sensual and inflated with pride. They took wives fair to look at. Wives from the \"mindless,\" the narrow - headed. They bred monst ers, wicked demons, male and female... -- Stanza X, verse 41, 2: 271 . . . it is most important to remember that the Egos of the apes are entities compelled by their Karma to incarnate in the animal forms, which resulted from the bestiality of the latest Third and the earliest Fourth Race men. They are entities who had already reached the \"human stage\" before this Round. Consequently, they form an exception to the general rule. The numberless traditions about Satyrs are no fables, but represent an extinct race of animal men. -- 2: 262 Nor did it yet end here."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 5 As time rolled on, and the still semi - astral forms consolidated into the physical the descendants of these creatures were modified by external conditions, until the breed, dwindling in size, culminat ed in the lower apes of the Miocene period. With these the later Atlanteans renewed the sin of the \"Mindless\" -- this time with full responsibility. The resultants of their crime were the species of apes now known as Anthropoid. -- 2: 689 Up to this time the forms were yet sufficiently mobile to make such union possible, but it is written that the Lords of Wisdom, seeing the terrible results, struck the races with sterility. In different parts of her work, Blavatsky has recorded very fully the ancestry of the apes from different points of view. She has cited facts which would be of interest to the anthropologist, the zoologist, the embryologist, or the student of folklore. Even many allusions in the Bible are cleared up in this discussion. But it is enough for us here to outline the story as to their origin. The separation of the sexes took place very gradually, as elsewhere stated. There was much unnatural cross - breeding, bringing about very low specimens of men, and slowly many other changes, of course, took place. There had been eternal spring in the sinless, mindless days of the race. But gradually, as season succeeded season, great cold in places forced men to seek methods of protection -- clothing, shelter, etc., and after the formation of the men - ani mals, the natures of animals changed. They became ferocious. The old, happy, golden days passed. Adi - varsha, the Eden of the first races, became a frozen white corpse. Misery and suffering drove men to appeal to the superior fathers. Then Divine Kings de scended and taught men sciences and arts . -- 2: 201 They formed the first Divine Dynasty, and in the course of time a glorious civilization arose. There have been several Divine Dynasties -- a series for every Root Race beginning with the Third, each ser ies according and adapted to its Humanity. -- 2: 429 In the words of a Master: \"The Fourth Race had its periods of the highest civilization. Greek and Roman and even Egyptian civilizations are nothing compared to the civilizations that began with the Thi rd Race\" - - after its separation. -- 2: 429 - 30 Their home, known as Lemuria, was on a gigantic continent, now buried beneath the Pacific Ocean. It stretched east as far as the two Americas, and west to the Indian Ocean and Africa. Australia was a portion of it, and the numerous islands dotted over the great ocean are the mountaintops of that ancient land. Easter Island belongs to the earliest civilization of the third race. Under the guidance of their divine rulers, they built large cities; cultivated arts and sciences; knew astronomy, architecture, and mathematics, to perfection. But this, of course, came about gradually. Between the final physical evolution and the first city built, many hundred thousands of years passed. In the sixth subrace, the first rock - cities were built of stone and lava. One of these, entirely of lava, was built about thirty miles west of Easter Island."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 6 The oldest remains of Cyclopean buildings were all the handiwork of the Lemurians of the last sub - race; and an occultist shows, t herefore, no wonder on learning that the stone relics found on the small piece of land called Easter Island by Captain Cook, are \"very much like the walls of the Temple of Pachacamac or the Ruins of Tia - Huanaco in Peru,\" and that they are in the CYCLOPEAN STYLE. The first large cities, however, appeared on that region of the continent which is now known as the island of Madagascar. There were civilized people and savages in those days as there are now. Evolution achieved its work of perfection with the form er, and Karma -- its work of destruction on the latter. The Australians and their like are the descendants of those, who, instead of vivifying the spark dropped into them by the \"Flames,\" extinguished it by long generations of bestiality. The Aryan nations could trace their descent through the Atlanteans from the more spiritual races of the Lemurians, in whom the \"Sons of Wisdom\" had personally incarnated. -- 2: 317 - 8 Modern archaeologists, in trying to discover how the enormous stones of these Cyclopean r elics were transported, do not take into account the fact that the builders were giants. It must be understood that although every race had its special continent, there has never been a dividing line between each race and its successor. One blends into th e other, their civilizations mingle over millions of years. Also, as might be inferred from all that has been quoted, there were striking contrasts in development. While some awakened to great knowledge, others were savages, hardly learning to build a fire . Again, a portion were leading the nomadic life. Referring to Lemuria: It is to this period that we have to look for the first appearance of the Ancestors of those, who are termed by us the most ancient peoples of the world now called respectively the Ar yan Hindus, the Egyptians, and the oldest Persians, on the one hand, and the Chaldees and Phoenicians on the other. These were governed by the DIVINE DYNASTIES, i.e. , kings and rulers who had of mortal man only his physical appearance as it was then , but w ho were Beings from spheres higher and more celestial than our own sphere will be, long Manvantaras hence. -- 2: 328 But -- even before the real advent of the Fourth or Atlantean race, the majority of mankind had fallen into iniquity and sin, save the hi erarchy of the \"Elect,\" the followers and disciples of the \"Sons of Will and Yoga\" -- called later the \"Sons of the Fire - Mist.\" -- 2: 319 The hour had struck for the beginning of the destruction of the third race, and the entry of the fourth, whose format ion commenced from a nucleus of Northern Lemurian third - race men, on the Atlantic portion of Lemuria, toward a point of land which is now, roughly speaking, in the mid - Atlantic. Their continent was formed by the coalescence of many islands and peninsulas which were up - heaved in the ordinary course of time and became ultimately the true home of the great Race known as the Atlanteans . -- 2: 334 Section VII"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 7 Just as on the first continent at the North Pole, the pitris formed the first race on seven zones, s o was the fourth formed in similar manner. According to Stanza X (2: 227): 38. Thus two by two, on the seven zones, the Third ( Race ) gave birth to the Fourth ( Race men ). The gods became no - gods ( Sura became a - Sura ). 39. The First ( Race ) on every zone was moon - colored ( yellow - white ); the Second, yellow, like gold; the Third, red; the Fourth, brown, which became black with sin. The first seven ( human ) shoots were all of one complexion in the beginning. The next ( seven , the sub - races ) began mixing their color s. These divisions were necessary to suit the karma of the various reincarnating monads, which were not all of equal purity in their last births in other worlds. All had a common origin, inasmuch as all the \"Creators\" were divine beings, though of differe nt classes or degrees of perfection in their hierarchy. This accounts for the difference of races, the inferiority of savages, and other human varieties. The first change began in the region now known as Behring Straits and what there was of dry land in c entral Asia. In those days even the Arctic regions were semi - tropical. It was when the third had reached only the middle point of its development that the Commentary says: \" The axle of the Wheel tilted. The Sun and Moon shone no longer over the heads of t hat portion of the SWEAT BORN; people knew snow, ice, and frost, and men, plants, and animals were dwarfed in their growth. Those that did not perish REMAINED AS HALF - GROWN BABES IN SIZE AND INTELLECT. This was the third pralaya of the races . -- 2: 329 Th e teaching is that after every great period of activity or manvantara, there follows a period of rest or pralaya, brought about or preceded by what are commonly called terrible catastrophes. But these, being under the law which acts in harmony with karma - - the great adjuster -- cannot, in the larger view, be regarded as misfortunes. They are cleansing processes. They purify, and permit a fresh start, as does death for the individual. The great races had their hour of glory, and at the appointed time they p assed. The continents which they inhabit perish alternately by fire and by water. Lemuria was consumed by fires of subterranean origin -- volcanic eruptions. Easter Island, with its craters of lava, is a belated witness of this. The Atlantean continent was swallowed up by floods; and the lands of the Aryan or fifth race will pass at their cyclic hour, ages hence. since Vaivasvata Manu's Humanity appeared on this Earth, there have already been four such axial disturbances; when the old continents -- save th e first one -- were sucked in by the oceans, other lands appeared, and huge mountain chains arose where there had been none before. The face of the Globe was completely changed each time; the survival of the fittest nations and races was secured through ti mely help; and the unfit ones -- the failures -- were disposed of by being swept off the earth. Such sorting and shifting does not happen between sunset and sunrise, as one may think, but requires several thousands of years before the new house is, set in order. -- 2: 330 The great numbers who always escape, led by their karma to safe places, form the seed for the new race, and there must always be a long period of transition before the new type becomes established. We see a similar thing on a smaller scal e taking place now on the American continent, where a new subrace is being formed from a mingling of the older races."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 8 the Americans have become in only three centuries a \"primary race,\" pro tem ., before becoming a race apart, and strongly separated from a ll other now existing races. They are, in short, the germs of the Sixth sub - race, and in some few hundred years more, will become most decidedly the pioneers of that race which must succeed to the present European or fifth sub - race, in all its new characte ristics. After this, in about 25,000 years, they will launch into preparations for the seventh sub - race; until, in consequence of cataclysms -- the first series of those which must one day destroy Europe, and still later the whole Aryan race (and thus affe ct both Americas), as also most of the lands directly connected with the confines of our continent and isles -- the Sixth Root - Race will have appeared on the stage of our Round. -- 2: 444 - 5 Some portions for karmic reasons remain distinct for ages, as the egos forming them have not yet completed their necessary experience in the old forms. The races overlap by hundreds of thousands of years. We have on the earth today descendants of the third, as before stated, in some of the Aborigines of Australia, now m uch changed in stature and intellectual capacity and rapidly dying out; while the majority of mankind now belongs to the seventh subrace of the fourth root - race. (See 2: 119.) The Chinese and others -- Malayans, Mongolians, Tibetans, Hungarians, Finns, an d even the Esquimaux are all remnants of this last offshoot. -- 2: 178 there is in the Malay race (a sub - race of the Fourth Root Race) a singular diversity of stature; the members of the Polynesian family (Tahitians, Samoans, and Tonga islanders) are of a higher stature than the rest of mankind ; but the Indian tribes and the inhabitants of the Indo - Chinese countries are decidedly below the general average. This is easily explained. The Polynesians belong to the very earliest of the surviving sub - races, the others to the very last and transitory stock. As the Tasmanians are now completely extinct, and the Australians rapidly dying out, so will the other old races soon follow. -- 2: 331 - 2 Stanza XI of the Book of Dzyan reads: 44. They ( the Atlanteans ) built great images, nine yatis high (27 feet ) the size of their bodies. Inner fires had destroyed the land of their fathers ( the Lemurians ). Water threatened the Fourth ( Race ). -- 2: 331 The Easter Island relics are eloquent memorials of the primeval giants an d are, many of them, 27 feet high. They have the distinctly sensual type of some of the Atlanteans. Easter Island belongs to the third - race continent, the main part of which was sunk 4,242,352 years ago. (See Volume 1, page 439n) But some of the lands rea ppeared later and were appropriated by the Atlanteans. Easter Island was taken possession of in this way by some of the fourth race, who built the statues now seen, but only to perish thereon when it was destroyed in one day by volcanic fires and lava. Whe n, much later, the final convulsion ingulfed the last remains of this once mighty continent, Easter Island was submerged with the rest. But a sudden uplifting of the floor of the ocean raised this small relic of the Archaic ages, untouched with its volcano and statues, during the Champlain epoch of northern polar submersion, as a standing witness to the existence of Lemuria. Read in this connection Volume 2, pages 326 - 8."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 9 Quite different are the Bamian statues in central Asia, whose physiognomy portrays the 'Sons of Gods,' while the former are the brood of mighty sorcerers. (See Volume 2, page 224.) Among the Bamian statues are five built by the fourth race, who sought refuge in this region to escape the general destruction. Here they recorded in stone what they knew would otherwise be lost to memory -- the early types. The first statue represents the first race and is 173 feet in height. The second -- 120 feet high -- represents the sweat - born; and the third -- measuring 60 feet -- immortalizes the race tha t fell, and thereby inaugurated the first physical race, born of father and mother, the last descendants of which are represented in the Statues found on Easter Isle; but they were only from 20 to 25 feet in stature at the epoch when Lemuria was submerged, after it had been nearly destroyed by volcanic fires. The Fourth Race was still smaller, though gigantic in comparison with our present Fifth Race, and the series culminated finally in the latter. -- 2: 340 In the third race, during its early stage of pu rity after the awakening of the human mind by the Sons of Wisdom, and while the third eye was yet active, men had a consciousness of their oneness with the Great Spirit of the universe. They had no religion as we understand it, for they were the embodiment of religion itself. They were at one with all that lived and breathed. Love, reverence, trust, confidence, and joy, radiated from them naturally. It was the \"Golden Age\" in those days of old, the age when the \"gods walked the earth, and mixed freely with mortals.\" Since then, the gods departed ( i.e. , became invisible), and later generations ended by worshiping their kingdoms the Elements. -- 2: 273 But as men grew and felt their power, as they tasted of the Tree of Wisdom, other feelings began to stir. T he lower man, the animal, began to awaken also and claim a hearing. These forces were not equally balanced in all. By degrees some obtained mastery over their instincts and joined the Sons of Light; others fell victims to them and became the slaves of matt er. Then different masters came to claim them. We have always to remember that life on this or any globe is the continuation of life from some other. Certain new forces are set in motion, but many come fully matured, ready under the proper conditions to s wing into fierce activity. Thus it is recorded that the Lemuro - Atlanteans were the first who had a dynasty of spirit - kings. But, strange as this may seem to one not grounded in the wisdom - religion, these rulers were not all good. Some were perfected in evi l, and formed a race of mighty sorcerers and magicians. When pupils were ready for them, they were at hand. We receive what we invite. King Thevetat was of this order, and it was under the influence of this king - demon that the Atlantean race became a natio n of wicked magicians. Between these, and those arrayed under the banner of light, there was, of course, constant conflict, which ended in that race in the submersion of the continent. But the war is still raging -- in men individually and in the nations a t large. The stories of the Babylonian and Mosaic floods are versions of this history. Legend and tradition bear out these facts, and distorted accounts are to be found in Biblical literature. (See Volume 2, page 222.) The giants of Genesis are the histor ical Atlanteans of Lanka and so were the Greek Titans. (See Volume 2, page 236.) One who has read and studied the Commentaries on the archaic doctrine, will easily recognise in some Atlanteans, the prototypes of the Nimrods, the Builders of the Tower of B abel, the Hamites, and all these tutti quanti of 'accursed memory,' as theological literature expresses it: of those, in short, who have furnished posterity with the orthodox types of Satan. -- 2: 272"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 10 The earliest tribes of the first Atlantean Races born on the Lemurian continent separated into the righteous and the unrighteous; those who worshiped the one unseen spirit of nature -- or the pantheists -- and those who worshiped the spirits of the earth, the dark anthropomorphic powers. Here, Blavatsky says, was the secret and mysterious origin of all the subsequent and modern religions, especially of the worship of the later Hebrews and their tribal God. The Lemurians gravitated toward the North Pole or the Heaven of their Progenitors (the Hyperborean Conti nent); the Atlanteans, toward the Southern Pole, the pit , cosmically and terrestrially -- whence breathe the hot passions blown into hurricanes by the cosmic Elementals, whose abode it is. -- 2: 274 The human period, as we understand the word \"human,\" may properly be said to begin with the fourth race. Those who were hitherto semi - divine Beings, self - imprisoned in bodies which were human only in appearance, became physiologically changed and took unto themselves wives who were entirely human and fair to l ook at, but in whom lower , more material , though sidereal, beings had incarnated. . . . (Lilith is the prototype of these in the Jewish traditions). -- 2: 284 - 5 After Lemuria went down, men decreased considerably in stature, and the duration of life dimin ished. Nevertheless they were still giants. Physical beauty and strength reached their climax toward the middle of the fourth subrace. (See Volume 2, page 319.) By this time, too, they had lost their inner vision, or third eye, which could then become acti ve only when artificially stimulated -- a process known only to the old sages. But the consolidation and perfection of the human frame caused this third eye to disappear from the outward anatomy, leaving its witness -- the pineal gland -- in the brain. Psy chically and spiritually, however, its mental and visual perception lasted till nearly the end of the fourth race, when, owing to the materiality and depraved condition of mankind, it died out altogether. When the divine powers became the handmaidens of t he newly - awakened physiological and psychic passions of the physical man, instead of their master, the third eye lost its power. Man's sin consisted not in using these newly - developed powers, but in misusing them; in making of the tabernacle, designed to c ontain a god, the fane of every spiritual iniquity. Should the reader feel perplexed at the use of the term \"spiritual\" instead of \"physical\" iniquity, he is reminded that there can be no physical iniquity. The body is simply the irresponsible organ, the t ool of the psychic, if not of the spiritual, man. And in the case of the Atlanteans, it was precisely the spiritual being which sinned, the spirit - element being still the \"Master\" Principle in man. Thus it is in those days that the heaviest Karma of the fi fth race was generated by our monads. Read in this connection, Volume 2, pages 295, 299, 302, 306. As has often been said, this is also the point beyond which no new monads have incarnated; and as many centuries elapse between incarnations of the same bein g, it is not difficult to grasp the teaching that many of us are working off the effects of evil karmic causes, generated in Atlantean bodies. (See Volume 2, page 303.) Section VIII The civilization of the fourth race was magnificent and dazzling in phy sical development. Many of the startling discoveries of our day, including flying machines, brought to the perfection we are striving for, belonged to the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 11 ordinary equipment of the Atlanteans. Complete records of this ancient race exist and will come to li ght at the proper time, but here and there can be found fragments which are suggestive. There is extant an account of a dialog between Midas the Phrygian, and Silenus, written during the days of Alexander the Great. The former is told of a continent that had existed in ancient times so immense that Asia, Europe, and Africa seemed like poor islands compared with it. It was the last to produce animals and plants of gigantic magnitude. There, said Silenus, men grew to double the size of the tallest man in hi s (the narrator's) time, and they lived to twice as old an age. They had wealthy cities with temples, and one of such (cities) held more than a million of inhabitants in it, gold and silver being found there in great abundance. -- The Secret Doctrine , 2: 7 60 Their intellects were giant - like as well as their bodies, and they had a knowledge of reincarnation, which tenet was passed on to the fifth race. Also, as the third eye was awake during a part of their history, they were aware of many of the finer forc es which do not exist consciously for this age, and which under the blighting effect of materialism have been laughed to scorn. But alas! the majority of that race elected to use this knowledge and power for selfish purposes and prepared for themselves who lesale destruction. The great waters swallowed them up. Although the sinking of the continent was inevitable, the destruction need not have been so wholesale. the \"Deluge\" overtook the Fourth, giant Race, not on account of their depravity, or because they had become \"black with sin,\" but simply because such is the fate of every continent, which -- like everything else under our Sun -- is born, lives, becomes decrepit, and dies. This was when the Fifth Race was in its infancy. Thus the giants perished -- t he magicians and the sorcerers, adds the fancy of popular tradition, but \"all holy saved,\" and alone the \"unholy were destroyed.\" This was due, however, as much to the prevision of the \"holy\" ones, who had not lost the use of their \"third eye,\" as to Karma and natural law. Speaking of the subsequent race (our Fifth Humanity), the commentary says: \" Alone the handful of those Elect, whose divine instructors had gone to inhabit that Sacred Island -- ' from whence the last Savior will come ' -- now kept mankind from becoming one - half the exterminator of the other (as mankind does now -- H. P. B.). It (mankind) became divided. Two - thirds of it were ruled by Dynasties of lower, material Spirits of the earth, who took possession of the easily accessible bodies; one - third remained faithful, and joined with the nascent Fifth Race -- the divine Incarnates. When the Poles moved (for the fourth time) this did not affect those who were protected, and who had separated from the Fourth Race. Like the Lemurians -- alone the u ngodly Atlanteans perished, and ' were seen no more.' . . . \" -- 2: 350 A graphic account is given of the submersion of the main part of the continent in Volume 2, pages 427 - 8, but the total obliteration extended over enormous periods. It is on this colossa l first cataclysm which began gradually in the Eocene Age (see Volume 1, p. 439n), and lasted during a period of 150,000 years, that traditions of all the deluges are built, the Jews constructing their version on the event which took place later on Poseido nis. (See Volume 2, p. 751n) For after the main continent had vanished, there was a large island, Ruta, which was submerged approximately 850,000 years ago, at which time, it is stated, the Aryans were 200,000 years old (see Volume 2, p. 395). Then a small er island, Daitya, sank about 270,000 years ago (see Volume 1, p."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 12 651), and finally the last remnant, Poseidonis, referred to by Plato, disappeared about 11,000 years ago (see Volume 2, p. 324 footnote). Thus it will be seen that the races overlap by many thousands of years. Nothing is finally destroyed in nature, until something else is established. And the processes move so silently and, to our senses, so slowly, that it is often difficult to detect them -- just as one cannot see a tree grow, but sees on ly the results of growth. When a transition period can be clearly recognised, as is the case in our time, for instance, it is evidence that a new order is approaching rapidly. The civilization of the Atlanteans was greater even than that of the Egyptians. It is their degenerate descendants, the nation of Plato's Atlantis, which built the first Pyramids in the country, and that certainly before the advent of the \"Eastern Aethiopians,\" as Herodotus calls the Egyptians. -- 2: 429 In fact, the more remote the records, the more dazzling was the splendor. Among other arts and sciences they had those of astronomy and symbolism, including a knowledge of the zodiac; all of which they passed on to the fifth race (see Volume 2, p. 431). Further, a study of the Dender a Zodiac shows that the Great Pyramid must have been built 78,000 years ago (see Volume 2, p. 432). The difficulties that historians have had in explaining the mature development of the Egyptians from the most remote antiquity are cleared up by a consider ation of the many facts brought out in The Secret Doctrine regarding the Atlanteans and the enormous overlapping of the two races. Since the beginning of the Atlantean Race many million years have passed, yet we find the last of the Atlanteans, still mixe d up with the Aryan element, 11,000 years ago . . . though in characters and external type the elder loses its characteristics, and assumes the new features of the younger race. This is proved in all the formations of mixed human races. -- 2: 444 The foll owing gives a hint about the merging of the races and the origin of the prehistoric Egyptians. Nearly five hundred years before the actual era, Herodotus was shown by the priests of Egypt the statues of their human Kings and Pontiffs -- piromis (the archi - prophets or Maha - Chohans of the temples), born one from the other (without the intervention of woman) who had reigned before Menes, their first human King. These statues, he says, were enormous colossi in wood, three hundred and forty - five in number, each of which had his name , his history , and his annals . And they assured Herodotus . . . that no historian could ever understand or write an account of these superhuman Kings, unless he had studied and learned the history of the three dynasties that preceded the human -- namely the DYNASTIES OF THE GODS, that of demi - gods, and of the Heroes, or giants. These \"three dynasties\" are the three Races. -- 2: 369 . . . the Egyptians, as well as the Greeks and \"Romans\" some thousand years ago, were \"remnants of the A tlanto - Aryans,\" i.e. , the former, of the older, or Ruta Atlanteans; the last - named, the descendants of the last race of that island, whose sudden disappearance was narrated to Solon by the Egyptian Initiates. The human Dynasty of the older Egyptians, begin ning with Menes, had all the knowledge of the Atlanteans, though there was no more Atlantean blood in their veins. Nevertheless, they had preserved all their Archaic records. . . ."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 13 And it is just because the Egyptian Zodiac is between 75 and 80,000 years old that the Zodiac of the Greeks is far later. -- 2: 436 In fact, the Greeks were but the dwarfed and weak remnants of that once glorious nation, the latest seventh subrace of the Atlanteans, already swallowed up in one of the early subraces of the Aryan stock; one that had gradually spread over the continent and islands of Europe, as soon as they had begun to emerge from the seas. Descending from the high plateaux of Asia, where the two Races had sought refuge in the days of the agony of Atlantis, it ha d been slowly settling and colonizing the freshly emerged lands. The emigrant sub - race had rapidly increased and multiplied on that virgin soil; had divided into many families, which in their turn divided into nations. Egypt and Greece, the Phoenicians, an d the Northern stocks, had thus proceeded from that one sub - race. Thousands of years later, other races -- the remnants of the Atlanteans -- \"yellow and red, brown and black\" -- began to invade the new continent. There were wars in which the newcomers were defeated; and they fled, some to Africa, others to remote countries. Some of these lands became in course of time -- owing to new geological convulsions -- islands. Being thus forcibly separated from the continents, the result was that the undeveloped tri bes and families of the Atlantean stock fell gradually into a still more abject and savage condition. -- 2: 743 - 4 The duration of the periods that separate the fourth from the fifth race is too tremendous to make possible a detailed account of those times . During the course of the post - diluvian ages, which were marked at certain periodical epochs by the most terrible cataclysms, so many races and nations were born, lived their time and died, leaving scarcely a trace behind, that no description of value can be offered concerning them (see Vol. II, p. 437). To return to the beginning of the fifth race, which has existed quite free from its parent stem about a million years, making the life of a subrace about 210,000 years (see Volume 2, p. 435), Stanza XII r eads: 48. The Fifth Race produced from the Holy Stock ( remained ). It was ruled by Her First Divine Kings. -- 2: 351 This race can trace its descent through the Atlanteans, from the more spiritual races of the Lemurians, in whom the Sons of Wisdom had per sonally incarnated (see Volume 2, p. 318). Blavatsky comments that history does not begin here, but living and ever - recurring tradition does. What we call history does not go back further than the fantastic origins of our fifth subrace, a few thousands of years (see Volume 2, p. 351; also G. de Purucker's Fundamentals of the Esoteric Philosophy , pp. 239 - 40). Even so - called \"universal\" (?) history embraces but a tiny field in the almost boundless space of the unexplored regions of our latest fifth root - race (see Volume 1, p. 406). The day when much, if not all, of that which is given here from the archaic records, will be found correct, is not far distant. The physical brain may forget events within the scope of our terrestrial life, but the bulk of collect ive recollections can never desert the divine soul within us, upon whose tablets are printed in indelible characters the pictures of all our mighty past. For the lower range of our being its whispers may be too soft, the sound of its words too far off the plane perceived by our physical senses; yet the shadow of events that were ,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 14 just as much as the shadows of events that are to come , is within its perceptive powers, and is ever present before the mind's eye (see Volume 2, p. 424). As is evident in a unive rse which is a complete whole, of which man himself is an inseparable part -- a universe where order and fitness rule -- there must always have been, as there always will be, relations between all the parts. The endless varieties of this humanity have been under the same influences as have the geological formations of their times, as have the elements and the atmosphere -- which influences have been expressed, for instance, in the color of the skin and hair, the sense organs, the texture of their bodies, et c. One element has been added in each round in the order of fire, air, water, earth. The earth, as we know it now, had no existence before the fourth round, hundreds of millions of years ago, the time of the commencement of our geological earth (see Volum e 1, p. 252n). The same order is repeated on a much smaller scale for each race. For instance, the humanities developed coordinately with the elements, one of the latter being accentuated for each race, which was physiologically adapted to meet it. Our fif th race is rapidly approaching the fifth element, one which has more to do with metaphysics than with physics. But the element to be perfected in the fifth round can only be foreshadowed in the fifth race of the fourth round. Likewise, we, being of the fif th race, have five senses, but the last sense will not be fully developed before the next round. Thus is everything repeated again and again in nature over eternities, always on a more perfect scale. In the first round the earth was ethereal; likewise in t he first race of this round. In the third round all became more compact, so again in the third root - race of this round (see Volume 1, pp. 188 - 9). The first race was speechless, being devoid of mind. The second had a sound language composed of vowels alone . The third in the beginning had a kind of language which was only a slight improvement on the various sounds in nature; but after the separation into sexes in the latter part, speech began to be developed. Before this, men communicated through what now wo uld be called \"thought - transference.\" Highly developed languages did not come before the fourth race. In this our fifth, inflexional speech, the root of sanskrit, was in the beginning the only language (see Volume 2, pp. 199 - 200). Each race has its contin ent, as has been stated. The first was born on the Imperishable Sacred Land at the North Pole, whose destiny it is to last from the beginning to the end of the manvantara through each round. It is the cradle of the first man, and the dwelling of the last divine mortal. -- 2: 6 Explorers are not mistaken in their suspicion of a continent at the North Pole. It still exists, though hidden by the frozen waters. Of this mysterious and sacred land it is said in one of the Commentaries, that the \"pole - star has its watchful eye upon it, from the dawn to the close of the twilight of 'a day' of the GREAT BREATH.\" -- 2: 6 The second continent stretched out from the first southward and westward and has been called the Hyperborean. Lemuria and Atlantis, as has been f requently stated, were the dwellings of the third and fourth races. The fifth continent is America, but Europe and Asia Minor, almost coeval with it, are generally referred to by the Indo - Aryan occultists as the fifth (see Volume 2, pp. 7 - 8). The Aryan rac e, however, was born and developed in the far north, though after the sinking of the continent of Atlantis, its tribes emigrated further south into Asia. Hence Prometheus (who is called the hero of the fifth race) is the son of Asia (see Volume 2, pp. 768 - 9)."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ARCHAIC HISTORY OF T HE HUMAN RACE PART I II Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 15 As has happened before, so will it be again. The human races are born one from the other, develop, grow old, and die. Even now, under our very eyes, the new race and races are preparing to be formed, and it is in America that the transformation will t ake place, and has indeed already silently commenced -- so silently, that for long millenniums shall its pioneers, the peculiar children who will grow into peculiar men and women, be regarded as abnormal oddities physically and mentally. Then as they incre ase, and their numbers become with every age greater, one day they will awake to find themselves in a majority. It is the present mankind who will then begin to be regarded as exceptional mongrels, until these die out in their turn in civilized lands, surv iving only in small groups on islands -- the mountain peaks of today -- where they will vegetate, degenerate, and finally die out, perhaps millions of years hence, as the Aztecs have, as the Nyam - Nyam, and the dwarfish Moola Koorumba of the Nilgiri Hills a re dying -- all of whom are remnants of once mighty races. This process of preparation for the sixth great race must last throughout the sixth and seventh subraces. But the last remnants of the fifth continent will not disappear until some time after the birth of the new race; when another and new dwelling, the sixth continent, will have appeared above the new waters on the face of the globe, so as to receive the stranger. To it also will migrate and on it will settle all those who will be fortunate enough to escape the general disaster. Mankind will not grow again into giant physical bodies, because while the evolution of the fourth race led it down to the very bottom of materiality in its physical development, the present race is on its ascending arc; and the sixth will be rapidly growing out of bonds of matter and even of flesh. Thus it is the mankind of the New World -- America, whose continent arose during the palmy days of the great Atlantis (see Volume 2, p. 182) -- by far the senior of our Old World , so - called, whose mission and karma it is to sow the seeds for a forthcoming grander and far more glorious race than any we know of at present. The cycles of matter will be succeeded by cycles of spirituality, and of fully developed mind. According to thi s cyclic law, the majority of the future mankind will be composed of glorious adepts. Humanity is the child of cyclic destiny, and not one of its units can escape its unconscious mission, or get rid of the responsibility of its co - operative work with natur e. In the words of a sage: \"The present is the Child of the Past; the Future, the begotten of the Present. And yet, O present moment! Knowest thou not that thou hast no parent, nor canst thou have a child; that thou art ever begetting but thyself? Before thou hast even begun to say 'I am the progeny of the departed moment, the child of the past,' thou hast become that past itself. Before thou utterest the last syllable, behold! thou art no more the Present but verily that Future. Thus, are the Past, the Pr esent, and the Future, the ever - living trinity in one -- the Maha - maya of the Absolute IS.\" -- 2: 446"}]
