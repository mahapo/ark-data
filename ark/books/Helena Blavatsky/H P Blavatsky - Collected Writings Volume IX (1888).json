I, No. 5, January, 1888, pp. 337-338] People usually wish that their friends shall have a happy new year, and sometimes “p rosperous” is added to “happy.” It is not likely that much happiness or prosperity can come to those who are living for the truth under such a dark number as 1888; but still the year is heralded by the glorious star Venus-Lucifer, shining so resplendently that it has been mistaken for that still rarer visitor, the star of Bethlehem. This too, is at hand; and surely something of the Christos spirit must be born upon earth under such conditions. Even if happiness and prosperity are absent, it is possible to find something greater than either in this coming year. Venus-Lucifer is the sponsor of our magazine, and as we chose to come to light under its auspices, so do we desire to touch on its nobility. This is possible for us all personally, and instead of wishing our readers a happy or prosperous New Year, we feel more in the vein to pray them to make it one worthy of its brilliant herald. This can be effected by those who are courageous and resolute. Thoreau pointed out that there are artists in life, persons who can change the colour of a day and make it beautiful to those with whom they come in contact. We claim that there are adepts, masters in life who make it divine, as in all other arts. Is it not the greatest art of all, this which affects the very atmosphere in which we live? That it is the most important is seen at once, when we remember that every person who draws the breath of life affects the mental and moral atmosphere of the world, and helps to colour the day for those about him. Those who do not help to elevate the thoughts and lives of others must of necessity either paralyse them by indifference, or actively drag them down. When this point is reached, then the art of life is converted into the science of death; we see the black magician at work. And no one can be quite 4   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS i nactive. Although many bad books and pictures are produced, still not everyone who is in capable of writing or painting well insists on doing so badly. Imagine the result if they were to! Yet so it is in life. Everyone lives, and thinks, and speaks. If all our readers who have any sympathy with Lucifer endeavoured to learn the art of making life not only beautiful but divine, and vowed no longer to be hampered by disbelief in the possibility of this miracle, but to commence the Herculean task at once, then 1888, however unlucky a year, would have been fitly ushered in by the gleaming star. Neither happiness nor prosperity are always the best of bedfellows for such undeveloped mortals as most of us are; they seldom bring with them peace, which is the only permanent joy. The idea of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"peace is usually connected with the close of life and a religious state of mind. That kind of peace will however generally be found to contain the element of expectation. The pleasures of this world have been surrendered, and the soul waits contentedly in expectation of the pleasures of the next. The peace of the philosophic mind is very different from this and can be attained to early in life when pleasure has scarcely been tasted, as well as when it has been fully drunk of. The American Transcendentalists discovered that life could be made a sublime thing without any assistance from circumstances or outside sources of pleasure and prosperity. Of course this had been discovered many times before, and Emerson only took up again the cry raised by Epictetus. But every man has to discover this fact freshly for himself, and when once he has realised it he knows that he would be a wretch if he did not endeavour to make the possibility a reality in his own life. The stoic became sublime because he recognized his own absolute responsibility and did not try to evade it; the Transcendentalist was even more, because he had faith in the unknown and untried possibilities which lay within himself. The occultist fully recognises the responsibility and claims his title by having both tried and acquired knowledge of his own possibilities. The Theosophist who is at all in earnest, sees his responsibility and endeavours to find knowledge, living, in the 1 8 88    5 meantime, up to the highest standard of which he is aware. To all such Lucifer gives gr eeting! Man’s life is in his own hands, his fate is ordered by himself. Why then should not 1888 be a year of greater spiritual development than any we have lived through? It depends on ourselves to make it so. This is an actual fact, not a religious sentiment. In a garden of sunflowers every flower turns towards the light. Why not so with us? And let no one imagine that it is a mere fancy, the attaching of importance to the birth of the year. The earth passes through its definite phases and man with it; and as a day can be coloured so can a year. The astral life of the earth is young and strong between Christmas and Easter. Those who form their wishes now will have added strength to fulfil them consistently. –––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME IX January, 1888 “TO THE READERS OF LU CIFER ” [ Lucifer , Vol. 1, No. 5, January, 1888, pp. 340-343] Our magazine is only four numbers old, and already its young life is full of cares and tr ouble. This is all as it should be; i.e., like every other publication, it must fail to satisfy all its readers, and this is only in the nature of things and the destiny of every printed organ. But what seems a little strange in a country of culture and free thought is that Lucifer should receive such a number of anonymous, spiteful, and often abusive letters. This, of course, is but a casual remark, the waste-basket in the office being the only addressee and sufferer in this case; yet it suggests strange truths with regard to human nature. * ––––––––––– * “V ERBUM S AP .” It is not our intention to notice anonymous communications, even though they should em anate in a round-about way from Lambeth Palace. The matter “ Verbum Sap ” refers to is not one of taste; the facts must be held responsible for the offence; and, as the Scripture hath it, “Woe to that man by whom the offence cometh”! [ Matt., xviii, 7.] –––––––––– 6  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS S incerity is true wisdom, it appears, only to the mind of the moral philosopher. It is ru deness and insult to him who regards dissimulation and deceit as culture and politeness, and holds that the shortest, easiest, and safest way to success is to let sleeping dogs and old customs alone. But, if the dogs are obstructing the highway to progress and truth, and Society will, as a rule, reject the wise words of (St.) Augustine, who recommends that “no man should prefer custom before reason and truth,” is it a sufficient cause for the philanthropist to walk out of or even deviate from, the track of truth, because the selfish egoist chooses to do so? Very true, as remarked somewhere by Sir Thomas Browne that not every man is a proper champion for the truth, nor fit to take up the gauntlet in its cause. Too many of such defenders are apt, from inconsideration and too much zeal, to charge the troops of error so rashly that they “remain themselves as trophies to the enemies of truth.” Nor ought all of us (members of the Theosophical Society) to do so personally, but rather leave it only to those among our numbers who have voluntarily and beforehand sacrificed their personalities for the cause of Truth. Thus teaches us one of the Masters of Wisdom in some fragments of advice which are published further on for the benefit of the Theosophists (see the article that follows this).* While enforcing upon such public characters in our ranks as editors, and lecturers, etc., the duty of telling fearlessly “ the Truth to the face of LIE ,” he yet condemns the habit of private judgment and criticism in"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"every individual Theosophist. Unfortunately, these are not the ways of the public and readers. Since our journal is entirely unsectarian, since it is neither theistic nor atheistic, Pagan nor Christian, orthodox nor heterodox, therefore, its editors discover –––––––––– * [Reference is here made to an important letter from one of the Teachers published under the title of “Some Words on Daily Life.” Vide pp. 173-75 of Volume VII in the present Series for the text of this letter.— Compiler .] –––––––––– “ T O THE R EADERS OF L UCIFER”  7 e ternal verities in the most opposite religious systems and modes of thought. Thus Lu cifer fails to give full satisfaction to either infidel or Christian. In the sight of the former—whether he be an Agnostic, a Secularist, or an Idealist—to find divine or occult lore underlying “the rubbish” in the Jewish Bible and Christian Gospels is sickening; in the opinion of the latter, to recognise the same truth as in the Judeo-Christian Scriptures in the Hindu, Parsi, Buddhist, or Egyptian religious literature, is vexation of spirit and blasphemy. Hence, fierce criticism from both sides, sneers and abuse. Each party would have us on its own sectarian side, recognising as truth, only that which its particular ism does. But this cannot nor shall it be. Our motto was from the first, and ever shall be: “ THERE IS NO R ELIGION HIGHER THAN T RUTH .” Truth we search for, and, once found, we bring it fo rward before the world, whenceso-ever it comes. A large majority of our readers is fully satisfied with this our policy, and that is plainly sufficient for our purposes. It is evident that when toleration is not the outcome of indifference it must arise from wide-spreading charity and large-minded sympathy. Intolerance is pre eminently the consequence of ignorance and jealousy. He who fondly believes that he has got the great ocean in his family water-jug is naturally intolerant of his neighbour, who also is pleased to imagine that he has poured the broad expanses of the sea of truth into his own particular pitcher. But anyone who, like the Theosophists, knows how infinite is that ocean of eternal wisdom, to be fathomed by no one man, class, or party, and realizes how little the largest vessel made by man contains in comparison to what lies dormant and still unperceived in its dark, bottomless depths, cannot help but be tolerant. For he sees that others have filled their little water-jugs at the same great reservoir in which he has dipped his own, and if the water in the various pitchers seems different to the eye, it can only be because it is discoloured by impurities that were in the vessel before the pure crystalline element—a portion of the one eternal and immutable truth—entered into it. 8   B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS Th ere is, and can be, but one absolute truth in Kosmos. And little as we, with our"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"present limitations, can understand it in its essence, we still know that if it is absolute it must also be omnipresent and universal; and that in such case, it must be underlying every world-religion—the product of the thought and knowledge of numberless generations of thinking men. Therefore, that a portion of truth, great or small, is found in every religious and philosophical system, and that if we would find it, we have to search for it at the origin and source of every such system, at its roots and first growth, not in its later overgrowth of sects and dogmatism. Our object is not to destroy any religion but rather to help to filter each, thus ridding them of their respective impurities. In this we are opposed by all those who maintain, against evidence, that their particular pitcher alone contains the whole ocean. How is our great work to be done if we are to be impeded and harassed on every side by partisans and zealots? It would be already half accomplished were the intelligent men, at least, of every sect and system, to feel and to confess that the little wee bit of truth they themselves own must necessarily be mingled with error, and that their neighbours’ mistakes are, like their own, mixed with truth. Free discussion, temperate, candid, undefiled by personalities and animosity, is, we think, the most efficacious means of getting rid of error and bringing out the underlying truth; and this applies to publications as well as to persons. It is open to a magazine to be tolerant or intolerant; it is open to it to err in almost every way in which an individual can err; and since every publication of the kind has a responsibility such as falls to the lot of few individuals, it behoves it to be ever on its guard, so that it may advance without fear and without reproach. All this is true in a special degree in the case of a theosophical publication, and Lucifer feels that it would be unworthy of that designation were it not true to the profession of the broadest tolerance and catholicity, even while pointing out to its brothers and neighbours the errors which they indulge in and follow. While thus “ T O THE R EADERS OF L UCIFER”  9 k eeping strictly, in its editorials, and in articles by its individual editors, to the spirit and te achings of pure theosophy, it nevertheless frequently gives room to articles and letters which diverge widely from the esoteric teachings accepted by the editors, as also by the majority of theosophists. Readers, therefore, who are accustomed to find in magazines and party publications only such opinions and arguments as the editor believes to be unmistakably orthodox—from his peculiar standpoint—must not condemn any article in Lucifer with which they are not entirely in accord, or in which expressions are used that may be offensive from a sectarian or a prudish point of view, on the ground that such are unfitted for a theosophical magazine. They should remember that precisely because Lucifer is a theosophical magazine, it opens its columns to writers whose views of life and things may not only slightly differ from its own, but even be diametrically opposed to the opinion of the editors. The object of the latter is to elicit truth, not to advance the interest of any particular ism, or to pander to any hobbies, likes or dislikes, of any class of readers. It is only snobs and prigs who, disregarding the truth or error of the idea, cavil and strain merely over the expressions and words it is couched in. Theosophy, if meaning anything, means truth; and truth has to deal indiscriminately and in the same spirit of impartiality"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"with vessels of honour and of dishonour alike. No theosophical publication would ever dream of adopting the coarse—or shall we say terribly sincere—language of a Hosea or a Jeremiah; yet so long as those holy prophets are found in the Christian Bible, and the Bible is in every respectable, pious family, whether aristocratic or plebeian; and so long as the Bible is read with bowed head and in all reverence by young, innocent maidens and school-boys, why should our Christian critics fall foul of any phrase which may have to be used—if truth be spoken at all—in an occasional article upon a scientific subject? It is to be feared that the same sentences now found objectionable, because referring to Biblical subjects, would be loudly praised and applauded had they been directed against any gentile system of faith ( Vide "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME IX January, 1888 10  B LA VATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS certain missionary organs ).

Let him endeavour to learn the lesson which only opinions differing from his own can teach him. Let him be tolerant, if not actually charitable, and postpone his judgment till he extracts from the article the truth it must contain, adding this new acquisition to his store. One ever learns more from one’s enemies than from one’s friends; and it is only when the reader has credited this hidden truth to Lucifer, that he can fairly presume to put what he believes to be the errors of the article he does not like, to the debit account. –––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME IX January, 1888 A MODERN MAGICIAN [REVIEW] [ Lu cifer , Vol .

(Madras, 1887), but its general trend and phraseology suggest that it was written by H.P.B., especially as the subject-matter is of a kind that was pointed out by her on many other occasions.] Under the above title the author issues an address delivered at the last convention of th e delegates of the Theosophical Society at Adyar. Metaphysicians, who note with interest all criticisms of Western psychology from the Oriental standpoint, will welcome the appearance of this extremely able and instructive brochure, which constitutes the first instalment of Absolute Monism. The object of the writer is to discuss the point whether an examination of all theories, as to relations of mind and body, “does not lead us to the Unistic theory that Mind is Matter, and Matter is Mind.” He endeavours to merge the apparent dualism of subject and object into a fundamental unity:— Is mind a product of organized matter? No for organized matter is only a combination of material pa rticles, as is unorganized matter. How is it, then, that there is the manifestation of Mind in the one case, and not in the other? . . . . . . Can subjective facts ever emerge out of a group of molecules? Never; as many times never as there are molecules in the group. And why? Because Mind cannot issue from No Mind. (p. 13.) 12  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS Th e line of argument adopted ve rsus Materialism—the doctrine that mental facts are the resultant of chemical changes in the brain; force and matter being the only Ultimates of Existence—is unquestionably forcible. Mind can never be resolved into a “by-product” of brain activity, for several valid reasons. In the first place, in its aspect of thought, it exhibits concentration on an end, intelligence and interest in the subject under consideration, all of which characteristics, according to Tyndall and Du Bois-Reymond, are necessarily absent from those remarshallings of atoms and molecules which are declared to “cerebrate out” mental phenomena! In the second place, the gulf between consciousness and molecular change has never been bridged; an admission to which the leading physicists and physiologists of the day lend all the weight of their authority. The terms “consciousness” and “matter” are expressive of things so utterly contrasted, that all attempts to deduce the former from the latter have met with signal discredit. Nevertheless, materialists assume the contrary, whenever the necessities of their philosophy demand it. Hence, we find men, like Büchner, admitting in one place that “in the relation of soul and"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"brain, phenomena occur which cannot be explained by . . . . . matter and force, ” and elsewhere resolving mind into the “ activity of the tissues of the brain ,” “a mode of motion”—contradictions, the flagrancy of which is enhanced by the fact that the same author invests the physical automaton Man with a power to control his actions! Lastly, the degradation of consciousness into “brain function” by constituting philosophers, theologians, scientists, and all alike “conscious automata”—(machines whose thoughts are determined for , not by their conscious Egos)—knocks away the basis of argument. The only resource becomes universal scepticism; a denial of the possibility of attaining truth. Can impartiality, correct thinking and agreement, be expected on the part of controversialists who form part of a comedy of Automata? If mind is not inherent in matter, it cannot be evolved by mere nervous complexity. The combination of two A BSOLUTE M ONISM; OR, M IND IS M ATTER  13 c hemical elements cannot result in a compound in which something more than the co nstituent factors are present. It is sometimes urged that, since the properties of substances are often altogether changed in the course of chemical combinations—new ones arising with the temporary lapse of the old—consciousness may be explained as a “peculiar property” of matter under some of its conditions. Mr. Sundaram Iyer meets this objection ably. “Aquosity,” it is said, is a property of oxygen and hydrogen in combination, though not in isolation. To this he answers, “chemical properties are either purely subjective facts or objective-subjective ones” (p. 57). They exist only in the consciousness of the percipient, and represent no external and independent reality. Psychologists of the type of Huxley would do well to recall this fact, apart from the considerations springing from other data. Our author is loud in his praises of Panpsychism, that phase of pantheism which regards all matter as saturated with a potential psyche. He speaks of the “catholicity, sublimity and beauty . . . not to say the philosophy, and logic, and truthfulness of this creed of thought.” It is, however, clear that some of the authorities he cites in support of this view, more especially Clifford, Tyndall, and Ueberweg, represent a phase of thought which is too materialistic to do justice to an elevated pantheistic concept. Clifford’s conscious mind- stuff sublimated materialism, and Ueberweg speaks of those “sensations” present in “inanimate” objects which are “concentrated” in the human brain, as if they represented so many substances to be weighed in scales. Instructive and thoughtful as is the discussion of this subject (pp. 32-63), its value would have been increased by a survey of the pantheistic schools of German speculation, so many of whose conclusions are absolutely at one with esoteric views as to the Logos and the metaphysics of consciousness. After discussing the primary and secondary (so-called) qualities of matter as tabulated by Mill, Hamilton and others, Mr. Sundaram Iyer passes on the question: “What is force?” 14  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Force is matter . . . . it may be related to matter in . . . . four ways:—firstly, it may be an extraneous power to matter, acting upon it from without; secondly, it may be an inherent power in matter, influencing it from within, but yet distinct from the substance of matter; thirdly, it may be an innate power in matter, influencing it from within, and not distinct from the substance of matter; or fourthly, it may be a function of the substance of matter.” (pp. 76-7.) After an interesting criticism of current theories, he concludes that:— Function is simply the phenomenal effect of the latent cause, namely force, but never force itself. This po tential existence, which is in matter, is a physical existence. If not, it cannot, as shown before, produce any impression whatsoever upon or in the substance of matter. Matter is force and force is matter. It is not quite evident, however, whether this po sition is strictly reconcilable with the remark that “the primary qualities of matter are all simplifiable into . . . extension and (its) motion (actual or possible).” If force is a physical existence, and the real substance of matter at the same time, we get back no further into the mystery of what things-in-themselves really are. Physical existence remains the reality behind physical existence and the realization of matter and force, as aspects only of one basis, in no way simplifies the crux. It is not clear, moreover, what is the exact meaning the author intends by the use of the word “force.” Is it motion—molar or molecular—or the unknown cause of motion? According to Professor Huxley, “force” is merely an expression used to denote the cause of motion, whatever that may be. We only know this cause in its aspect of motion, and cannot penetrate behind the veil in order to grasp the Noumenon of which motion is the phenomenal effect. The necessity, therefore, of recognising the fact that motion is all that falls within the cognizance of sense, forbids the (profane) scientist to use the term “force” as representative of anything but an abstraction. The question is complicated by the consideration that the substantiality of various so-called “forces” appears most probable, and that this substantiality becomes A BSOLUTE M ONISM; OR, M IND IS M ATTER  15 o bjectively real to sense, only on a plane beyond this—the domain of matter in its order of ph ysical differentiations. The materialistic doctrine that force merely = a motion of matter, is contradicted by the fact that, as shown by Mill, motion can be temporarily neutralized. Lift a heavy weight on to a shelf and the mechanical energy expended in the act is latent in the potentiality of the weight to fall to the ground again. There is no immediate equivalent, as the attraction of the earth for the object remains the same (the now greater distance tending to diminish the amount, though in a very minute degree). It may be further noted that, granting Mr. Sundaram Iyer’s definition of matter as “ extension pure and simple ,” to be correct (p. 112), it is difficult to understand how he predicates this barren content as endowed with motion (p. 83). What moves?"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The rest of the brochure is taken up with some excellent criticism of current conceptions of atoms, space and heterogenealism (a creed now so sorely wounded by Mr. Crooke’s “Protyle”). Dealing with one of the late Mr. G. H. Lewes’ utterances, the author remarks with great truth: “By some mysterious law of occurrence the self-contradictions of the bulk of the erudite and enlightened are in point of gravity, palpableness, and number in direct proportion to their erudition and enlightenment.” With how many contrasted dicta from the pages of our Büchners, Spencers, Bains etc., etc., could this conclusion be supported. One word before we close. Is the title of the work well chosen? It appears to us the least satisfactory sentence which has been traced by the writer’s pen. The definition of “mind as matter and matter as mind” not only offers no solution of the great psychological problem discussed, but does injustice to the contents of the work itself. In the process of definition we “assemble representative examples of the phenomena,” under investigation and “our work lies in generalizing these, in detecting community in the midst of difference.” Now, there is no community whatever between mental and material facts. For as Professor Bain writes: 1 6  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS E xtension is but the first of a long series of properties all present in matter, all absent in mind. . . . Our mental experience, our feelings and thoughts, have no extension, no place, no form * or outline, or mechanical division of parts; and we are incapable of attending to anything mental until we shut off the view of all that.† The phenomenal contrast of mind and matter is not only at the root of our present co nstitution but an essential of our terrestrial consciousness. Duality is illusion in the ultimate analysis; but within the limits of a Universe-cycle or Great Manvantara it holds true. The two bases of manifested Being—the Logos (spirit) and Mulaprakriti (Matter, or rather its Noumenon), are unified in the absolute reality, but in the Manvantaric Maya, under space and time conditions, they are contrasted though mutually interdependent aspects of the ONE CAUSE. –– –––––––– * Nevertheless objectively viewed thoughts are actual entities to the occultist. † Mind end Body, pp. 125 and 135. –––––––––– ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME IX January, 1888 THE CHURCH AND THE DOCTRINE OF AT ONEMENT [ Lucifer, V ol.

The transition point appears in comparing the early passage ( 2 Sam ., xxiv, 1), when God is said to “move” David to number the people, with the later ( 1 Chron. , xxi, 1) , where Satan is said to be the instigator who “provoked” the numbering. But Satan is not yet the King Devil. We can take up our Bible and trace the gradual transformation of Satan from an accusing angel into the King Devil of popular theology.* This, we believe, is an even more damaging teaching for the Orthodox Church than any th eory about “Christ Crucified.” Mr. Headley seeks to prove Christ, the Rev. Haweis ridiculing and making away with the Devil, destroys and makes away for ever with Jesus, as Christ, also. For, as logically argued by Cardinal Ventura di Raulica, “ to demonstrate the existence of Satan, is to re-establish ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DOGMAS OF THE CH URCH , which serves as a basis for Christianity, and, without which, Satan [and Jesus] wo uld be but a name”; or to put it in the still stronger terms of the pious Chevalier Gougenot des Mousseaux, “ The Devil is the chief pillar of Faith . . . . if it was not for him, the Saviour, the Crucified, the Redeemer, would be but the most ridiculous of supernumeraries, and the Cross an insult to good sense.” (See Isis Unveiled, Vol. II, p. 14, and Vol. I, p. 103.)† Truly so.

But a very critical friend calls my attention to certain statements and apparent discrepancies in “The Esoteric Character of the Gospels,” on which I will beg leave to say a word. I find it affirmed on p. 300, in a foot-note,† that “Mr. G. Massey is not correct in saying that ‘. . . . The Gnostic form of the name Chrêst, or Chrêstos, denotes the Good God, not a human original,’ for it denotes the latter, i.e., a good, holy man.” But either the statement has no meaning as an answer to me, or it is based on a misunderstanding of mine. ‡ I was showing that the original Christ A N OTE OF E XPLANATION  19 of the Gnosis was not one particular form of human personality, like the supposed historic Christ, and that the na me denoted a divine, and not a human original . I was perfectly well aware, as your quotations show, that the name was afterwards conferred on the “good” as the Chrêstoi or Chrêstiani. Nor do I say, or anywhere imply, that the “ Karest, ” or mummy-type of immortality was the only form of the Christ, as your quotations again will prove. I have written enough about the Gnostic Christ who was the Immortal Self in man, the reflection of, or emanation from, the divine nature in humanity, and in both sexes, not merely in one.* This is the Christ that never could become a one person or be limited to one sex.

I have searched for Jesus many years in the Gospels and elsewhere without being able to catch hold of the hem of the garment of any human personality. Ben-Pandira we know a little of, but cannot make him out in the Christ of the Gospels. The Christ of the Gnosis can be identified, but not with any historic Jesus. We do not go to the Christian Gospels to learn the true nature of the Christ, or the incarnation according to the Gnostic religion (I use this term in preference to yours of the “Wisdom-Religion,” as being more definite and explanatory; not as a religion, supposed by the Idiotai to have followed in the wake of Historic Christianity!). These were known in Egypt, more than six thousand years ago. When the monuments began, the Cult of the Supreme God Atum was extant. We know not how many aeons earlier, but six thousand years will do. Atum=Adam was the divine father of an eternal soul which was personated as his son, named Iu-em-hept (the Greek Imothos or Aesculapius), an image of whom used to be seen (on shelf 3,578 b. 1874), in the British Museum.* He was the second Atum=Adam, –––––––––– have applied the surname used by him to Jesus or any other his toric Christ.

The temple priests assumed the names of the gods they served, and this is as well known a fact, as that the defunct Egyptian became an “Osiris”—was “osirified”—after his death. Yet Osiris was assuredly neither “man nor an Initiate,” but a being hardly recognised as such by the Royal Society of materialistic science. Why, then, could not an “Initiate,” who had succeeded in merging his spiritual being into the Christos state, be regarded as a Christos after his last and supreme initiation, just as he was called Chrêstos before that? Neither Plotinus, Porphyry nor Apollonius were Christians, yet, according to esoteric teaching, Plotinus realized this sublime state (of becoming or uniting himself with his Christos ) six times, Apollonius of Tyana four times, while Porphyry reached the exalted state only once, when over sixty years of age. The Gnostics called the “ Word ” “Abraxas” and “Christos” indiscriminately, and by whatever name we may call it, whether Ma-Kheru, or Christos or Abraxas, it is all one. That mystic state which gives to our inner being the impulse that attracts “the soul towards its origin and centre, the Eternal good,” as Plotinus teaches, and makes of man a god, the Christos or the unknown made manifest, is a pre eminently theosophical condition. It belongs to the temple mysteries, and the teachings of the Neo-Platonists.—H.P.B. 22  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS If any historic Jesus ever did claim to be the Gnostic Christ made flesh * once for all, he would be the su premest impostor in history. Let us define to ourselves very strictly what it is we do mean, or we shall introduce the direst confusion into the conflict, and we shall be unable to distinguish the face of friend from foe in the cloud of battle-dust which we may raise. What I find is, that Historic Christianity was based either upon the suppression or the perversion of all that was esoteric in Gnostic Christianity. And to bring any aid from the one to the support of the other is to try and re-establish with the left hand all that you are knocking down with the right.

What I meant was, that the “Fall of Man” in the Old Testament, is a falsification of fable, now exploded, and that the redemption from that fall, which is promised in the New, whether by an “Initiate” or “Son of God” is a fraud based on the fable, and a falsehood that is going to be exploded.

But, as I entirely agree with Mr. Massey, that historic Christianity was based upon the suppression, and especially the perversion of that which was esoteric in gnosticism, it is difficult to see in what it is that we disagree? The perversion of esoteric facts in the gospels is not so cleverly done as to prevent the true occultist from reading the Gospel narratives between the lines.—H.P.B. ‡ If Mr. G.

And on wh at a subject, if you please? On the subject of ballet girls. The Bible and the ballet are to be harmonized. The Reverends Haweis and Stewart Headlam, socialists and well-known preachers, stand firm for the right of the clergymen and the clergy in general, to frequent ballet theatres daily, and from the pulpit both praise the character of the dancers. However, the Bishop of London, Dr. Temple is of the opinion that as long as the dancers appear in such short dresses, the C HINESE S HADOWS   25 cl ergy should not be so regularly in attendance at ballet performances, as are many vicars, with Stewart Headlam at their head. Headlam—the same who recently led the funeral procession of A. Linnell—took offence at such a reactionary view of his superior. To the Bishop’s public rebuke in The Times, he replied in an open letter in Pall Mall. The dancing girls as a whole also took offence, and defended their outraged honour—in the shape of skirts that were too short—in a similar letter and in the same paper. The Primate of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury, took sides with the Bishop of London, and a brush fire swept the whole of the United Kingdom and has been burning since last September. Nothing can be done! The Primate (something similar to the Metropolitan) has no right to unfrock a pastor. Once a man becomes a clergyman in a Protestant Church, he is going to die one, were he even to marry all the ballet dancers and cut the throats of all his mothers-in-law; he would remain a “reverend” even at forced labour. –––––––––– The sermons of Headlam and of Haweis, his Rector and immediate superior, are as touching as they are instructive.

If you go to Haweis—laughter and bravos resound instead of “Amens,” and the lovely sex blushes, but"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"nevertheless listens and laughs. The very cream of the aristocratic orthodox faithful gather there; while at General Booth’s, according to his own proud declaration, the dregs of Society are both on the platform and among the public. Now what is the difference between these gatherings? The “Army” sings about the Christ to the tune of racy songs, while the flock of Haweis listens to the racy sermons of their preacher, with prayer books in their prayerfully folded hands. . . If any among the Russian readers wishes to assure himself of this, let him read the report 26  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS of any of his sermons in the London World. In one of them, the World writes: Both men and women blushed listening to the sermon about the moral superiority of actors and actresses, ab out the naked inhabitants of the Orient, the half-undressed ladies of the London balls, the naked naiad of the aquarium, the picturesque suits of the bathers at seashore bathing establishments, and about the beauties of the ballet. Both of the famous preachers, Haweis and Headlam, have transformed their pulpits in to oratorial tribunes similar to ancient Athens, where feminine beauty in general, and Aspasia and Company in particular, were defended. In both pulpits the corps de ballet is glorified. “Is it possible,” asks the first-named reverend, “that God would have created woman’s body so that it would be sinful to look at it?” ( sic ). In the opinion of the preacher, “a well-shaped ballet dancer would sin in hiding God’s handiwork, and she should, for the glory of God, appear on the stage covered merely by her own personal virtue,” and with nothing else. It is sinful for a pure-minded worshipper of feminine beauty to chime in with the hypocrites who require more garments on the dancers, because this is tantamount to “giving preference to textile fabrics made with human hands, rather than to the body of woman, created by the hand of the Almighty,” i.e., a preference of “Manchester industrialists to the Creator of the heavens and the earth” ( sic ) .

It is enough to hear such words in their songs as: “My Jesus is a jolly old boy” ( sic ) , to become convinced that this army of Christians is electrified not by the name of Christ, but by purely psycho-physiological means, and an awful excitement of the nervous system, and that those among them who are really sincere are miserable psychopaths, while the others are acting under the influence of a temporary intoxication from noise, rapid motion and fancied exultation. The “General” himself is a fat old man, as healthy as a bull, who started his life as a boy in a slaughter-house, and continued as a butcher clerk. He gets up and raises his hands in theatrical manner, as if blessing the public; in reality he is magnetizing it, befoggs it and searches for a nervous subject. Having observed a “suitable person,” he centres upon him all his attention, and then begins a very curious show, for anyone who is familiar with the methods of mesmerizers. The subject soon feels the heavy gaze of the “General” upon him, as if pinning him down, and begins nervously to fidget. If, against expectation, the subject is too weak to be handled all alone, the General forces the rest of the public to act in accord with him.

Like a bird glamorized by the snake’s gaze, the victim moves forward, and is being unconsciously pushed from three sides by an interested public. When at the steps of the stage, he is seized by dozens of the brave warriors’ hands, and is placed in a semi-conscious state before the ramp. From that moment he becomes for the rest of the evening, if not for longer, the property of the “army,” its new recruit.

That much is obvious, namely, that according to official statistics, wherever a part of the army may be settled, whatever town or community, the number of illegitimate births rises by some 35% in the first year. Such little peccadillos are playing into the hands of the General. They constantly give occasion for new “repentance,” and thus uphold in the warriors the religious flame, which otherwise would have gone out long ago. Abroad, and even in England itself, they believe naively that the Salvation Army is a religious brotherhood (!). Curious aberration! In the United Kingdom alone there are 450,000, and in London 280,000 people belonging to the Army. Not before the XIXth century has passed into eternity, will the Englishmen probably understand their mistake. . . . The Salvation Army is in reality a political society under the mask of religious striving. But this is known but to a few, those who hold the side-wires attached to the basic harness of Booth in their hands. The General holds the reins of the army, and the leaders of the “Sons of the Morning”—members of a society as yet little known—have fastened their invisible threads to his strong traces. So far both are rushing at full speed merely around the vicious circle of their own seemingly special arena, to the great edification of the fanatics.

We know that by paralyzing gradually within ourselves the appetites of the lower personality, and thereby deadening the voice of the purely physiological mind— that mind which depends upon, and is inseparable from, its medium or vehicle, the organic brain—the animal man in us may make room for the spiritual; and once aroused from its latent state, the highest spiritual senses and perceptions"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"grow in us in proportion, and develop pari passu with the “divine man.” This is what the great adepts, the Yogis in the East and the Mystics in the West, have always done and are still doing. But we also know, that with a few exceptions, no man of the world, no materialist, will ever believe in the existence of such adepts, or even in the possibility of such a spiritual or psychic development. “The (ancient) fool hath said in his heart, There is no God”; the modern says, “There are no adepts on earth, they are figments of your diseased fancy.” Knowing this we hasten to reassure our readers of the Thomas Didymus type.

Such articles as our editorials, the Comments on Light on the Path, etc., etc.—are not intended for Materialists. They are addressed to Theosophists, or readers who know in their hearts that Masters of Wisdom do exist: and, though absolute truth is not on earth and has to be searched for in higher regions, that there still are, even on this silly, ever-whirling little globe of ours, some things that are not even dreamt of in Western philosophy. To return to our subject. It thus follows that, though “general abstract truth is the most precious of all blessings” for many of us, as it was for Rousseau, we have, meanwhile, to be satisfied with relative truths. In sober fact, we are a poor set of mortals at best, ever in dread before the face of even a relative truth, lest it should devour ourselves and our petty little preconceptions along with us. As for an absolute truth, most of us are as incapable of seeing it as of reaching the moon on a bicycle. Firstly, because absolute truth is as immovable as the mountain of Mohammed, which refused to disturb itself for the prophet so that he had to go to it himself. And we have to follow his example if we would approach it even at a distance. Secondly, because the kingdom of absolute truth is not of this world, while we are too much of it.

As physical man, limited and trammelled from every side by illusions, cannot reach truth by the light of his terrestrial perceptions, we say—develop in you the inner knowledge. From the time when the Delphic oracle said to the enquirer “Man, know thyself,” no greater or more important truth was ever taught. Without such perception, man will remain ever blind to even many a relative, let alone absolute, truth. Man has to know himself, i.e., acquire the inner perceptions which never deceive, before he can master any absolute truth. Absolute truth is the symbol of Eternity, and no finite mind can ever grasp the eternal, hence, no truth in its fulness can ever dawn upon it. To reach the state during which man sees and senses it, we have to paralyze the senses of the external man of clay. This is a difficult task, we may be told, and most people will, at this rate, prefer to remain satisfied with relative truths, no doubt. But to approach even terrestrial truths requires, first of all, love of truth for its own sake, for otherwise no recognition of it will follow. And who loves truth in this age for its own sake? How many of us are prepared to search for, accept, and carry it out, in the midst of a society in which anything that would achieve success has to be built on appearances, not on reality, on self-assertion, not on intrinsic value? We are fully aware of the difficulties in the way of receiving truth.

If, so far back as the century of Democritus, she appeared to him under the form of a goddess lying at the very bottom of a well, so deep that it gave but little hope for her release; under the present circumstances we have a certain right to believe her hidden, at least, as far off as the ever invisible dark side of the moon. This is why, perhaps, all the votaries of hidden truths are forthwith set down as lunatics. However it may be, in no case and under no threat shall Lucifer be ever forced into pandering to any universally and tacitly recognised, and as universally practised lie, but will hold to fact, pure and simple, trying to proclaim truth whensoever found, and under no cowardly mask. Bigotry and intolerance may be regarded as orthodox and sound policy, and the encouraging of social prejudices and personal hobbies at the cost of truth, as a wise course to pursue in order to secure success for a publication. Let it be so. The Editors of Lucifer are Theosophists, and their motto is chosen: Vera pro gratiis. They are quite aware that Lucifer’s libations and sacrifices to the goddess Truth do not send a sweet savoury smoke into the noses of the lords of the press, nor does the bright “Son of the Morning” smell sweet in their nostrils He is ignored when not abused as— veritas odium parit. Even his friends are beginning to find fault with him. They cannot see why it should not be a purely Theosophical magazine, in other words, why it refuses to be dogmatic and bigoted. Instead of devoting every inch of space to theosophical and occult teachings, it opens its pages “to the publication of the most grotesquely heterogeneous elements and conflicting doctrines.” This is the chief accusation, to which we answer—why not? Theosophy is divine knowledge, and knowledge is truth; every true fact, every sincere word are thus part and parcel of Theosophy. One who is skilled in divine alchemy, or even approximately blessed with the gift of the perception of truth, will find and extract it from an erroneous as much as from a correct statement.

A Theosophical magazine is thus, perhaps, the only publication where one may hope to find, at any rate, the unbiassed, if still only approximate truth and fact. Naked truth is reflected in Lucifer under its many aspects, for no philosophical or religious views are excluded from its pages. And, as every philosophy and religion, however incomplete, unsatisfactory, and even foolish some may be occasionally, must be based on a truth and fact of some kind the reader has thus the opportunity of comparing, analyzing, and choosing from the several philosophies discussed therein. Lucifer offers as many facets of the One universal jewel as its limited space will permit, and says to its readers: “Choose you this day whom ye will serve: whether the gods that were on the other side of the flood which submerged man’s reasoning powers and divine knowledge, or the gods of the Amorites of custom and social falsehood, or again, the Lord of (the highest) Self—the bright destroyer of the dark power of illusion?” Surely it is that philosophy that tends to diminish, instead of adding to, the sum of human misery, which is the best.

When a journal of free thought, conducted by an Atheist, inserts an article by a Mystic or Theosophist in praise of his occult views and the mystery of Parabrahman, and passes on it only a few casual remarks, then shall we say Lucifer has found a rival. When a Christian periodical or missionary organ accepts an article from the pen of a freethinker deriding belief in Adam and his rib, and passes criticism on Christianity—its editor’s faith—in meek silence, then it will have become worthy of Lucifer, and may be said truly to have reached that degree of tolerance when it may be placed on a level with any Theosophical publication. But so long as none of these organs does something of the kind, they are all sectarian, bigoted, intolerant, and can never have an idea of truth and justice. They may throw innuendoes against Lucifer and its editors, they cannot affect either. In fact, the editors of that magazine feel proud of such criticism and accusations, as they are witnesses to the absolute absence of bigotry, or arrogance of any kind in theosophy, the result of the divine beauty of the doctrines it preaches. For, as said, Theosophy allows a hearing and a fair chance to all. It deems no views—if sincere—entirely destitute of truth. It respects thinking men, to whatever class of thought they may belong. Ever ready to oppose ideas and views which can only create confusion without benefiting philosophy, it leaves their expounders personally to believe in whatever they please, and does justice to their ideas when they are good. Indeed, the conclusions or deductions of a philosophic writer may be entirely opposed to our views and the teachings we expound; yet, his premises and statements of facts may be quite correct, and other people may profit by the adverse philosophy, even if we ourselves reject it, believing we have something higher and still nearer to the truth. In any case, our profession of faith is now made plain, and all that is said in the foregoing pages both justifies and explains our editorial policy.

This, however, as remarked by Richter, presents a certain danger. Some truth, to be sure, may be occasionally reflected as in a mirror on the spot we gaze upon, and thus reward the patient student. But, adds the German thinker, “I have heard that some philosophers in seeking for Truth, to pay homage to her, have seen their own image in the water and adored it instead.” It is to avoid such a calamity—one that has befallen every founder of a religious or philosophical school—that the editors are studiously careful not to offer the reader only those truths which they find reflected in their own personal brains. They offer the public a wide choice, and refuse to show bigotry and intolerance, which are the chief landmarks on the path of Sectarianism. But, while leaving the widest margin possible for comparison, our opponents cannot hope to find their faces reflected on the clear waters of our Lucifer, without remarks or just criticism upon the most prominent features thereof, if in contrast with theosophical views. This, however, only within the cover of the public magazine, and so far as regards the merely intellectual aspect of philosophical truths. Concerning the deeper spiritual, and one may almost say religious, beliefs, no true Theosophist ought to degrade these by subjecting them to public discussion, but ought rather to treasure and hide them deep within the sanctuary of his innermost soul. Such beliefs and doctrines should never be rashly given out, as they risk unavoidable profanation by the rough handling of the indifferent and the critical. Nor ought they to be embodied in any publication except as 42  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS hy potheses offered to the consideration of the thinking portion of the public.

While the authorship of this review is not absolutely certain, the authoritative manner in which it is written and the nature of the subject strongly suggest that it is from H.P.B.’s pen.] This, the latest of the admirable publications now being issued by Monsieur Georges Ca rré, under the auspices of “L’Isis,” the French branch of the Theosophical Society, deserves a hearty welcome at the hands of all students of Occultism, as it fulfils the promise of its title, which is high praise indeed. The book is written and constructed on correct Occult principles; it contains seven chapters, three devoted to theory and four to the application and practical illustration of that theory. After an eloquent introductory chapter, Monsieur Papus proceeds to lead his readers by easy transitions into the mysterious science of numbers. This—the first key to T RAITÉ É LÉMENTAIRE DE S CIENCE O CCULTE  45 pr actical Occultism—is at once the simplest and the most subtle of sciences. Hitherto there has existed no really elementary exposition of its primary, fundamental principles. And, as this science of numbers lies at the base of every one of those applications of occult science which are still to any extent studied, a knowledge of it is almost indispensable. Astrology, Chiromancy, Cartomancy, in short, all the arts of divination, rest ultimately on numbers and their occult powers, as a foundation. And yet, though the students of each of these several arts must, perforce, acquire a certain knowledge of numerical science, yet very few of them possess that knowledge in a systematic and co-ordinated form. Of course Monsieur Papus does not, and cannot, give anything like a complete textbook on the subject, but he does give, in clear language, the fundamental guiding principles of this science. Moreover, he illustrates the methods of numerical working, by numerous and well-chosen examples—an aid which is simply invaluable to the student who is making his first entrance into this field of study. In the third chapter these abstract formulae are given as they relate to man, as an individual, and as a member of that larger whole, called humanity. This completes the purely theoretical portion of the book, and in"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"the fourth chapter we are shown how these general principles work in their application. Signs and symbols are proved to be the natural expressions of ideas in accordance with fixed laws, and the method is applied by way of illustration to the interpretation of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus. The relation between number and form is shown as exhibited in geometrical figures, and Monsieur Papus gives a clue to a subject which has puzzled many—the actual influence in life of names. This chapter is most enthralling, but lack of space forbids any detailed comments, for so much would have to be said. Chapters five and six are almost equally interesting; full of lucid illustration and valuable hints to the practical student, they form almost a manual in themselves. But 46  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS on one point Monsieur Papus is certainly in error, though, since it is on a matter of history, its importance is relatively small. He attaches far too much weight to the Jews and to their national system of occultism—the Kabbala. True, that system is the most familiar in Europe; but it has been so much overlaid by a semi-esoteric veil, and additions and interpolations by Christian Occultists, that its inner grossness is lost sight of; so that students are apt to be led away from the truth, and to form erroneous conceptions as to the value and meaning of many symbols, the importance of which in practical work is very great. What esoteric knowledge the Jews possessed, they derived either from the Egyptians or the Babylonians during the captivity. Hence Monsieur Saint-Ives d’Alveydre, his gigantic erudition notwithstanding, is altogether mistaken in the stress he lays on their knowledge, their place in history and their mission as a nation. This, however, is but a matter of small moment in a book, the practical value of which it would be difficult to over-estimate. –––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME IX February, 1888 WHAT OF PHENOMENA? [ Lucifer , Vol. I, No. 6, February, 1888, pp. 504-506] To the Editor of Lucifer. I a vail myself of your invitation to correspondents, in order to ask a question. How is it that we hear nothing now of the signs and wonders with which Neo-theosophy was ushered in? Is the “age of miracles” past in the Society? Yours respectfully, * . “Occult phenomena,” is what our correspondent apparently refers to. They failed to pr oduce the desired effect, but they were, in no sense of the word, “miracles.” It was supposed that intelligent people, especially men of science, would, at least, have recognized the existence of a new and deeply interesting field of enquiry and research W HAT OF P HENOMENA ?  47 wh en they witnessed physical effects produced at will, for which they were not able to account. It was supposed that theologians would have welcomed the proof of which they stand so sadly in need in these agnostic days, that the soul and the spirit are not mere creations of their fancy, due to ignorance of the physical constitution of man, but entities quite as real as the body, and much more important. These expectations were not realized. The phenomena were misunderstood and misrepresented, both as regards their nature and their purpose. In the light which experience has now thrown upon the matter, the explanation of this unfortunate circumstance is not far to seek. Neither science nor religion acknowledges the existence of the Occult, as the term is understood and employed in theosophy; in the sense, that is to say, of a super-material, but not super-natural, region, governed by law; nor do they recognize the existence of latent powers and possibilities in man. Any interference with the everyday routine of the material world is attributed, by religion, to the arbitrary will of a good or an evil autocrat inhabiting a supernatural region inaccessible to man and subject to no law, either in his actions or constitution, and for a knowledge of whose ideas and wishes mortals are entirely dependent upon inspired communications delivered through an accredited messenger. The power of working so-called miracles has always been deemed the proper and sufficient credentials of a messenger from heaven, and the mental habit of regarding any occult power in that light is still so strong that any exercise"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"of that power is supposed to be “miraculous,” or to claim to be so. It is needless to say that this way of regarding extraordinary occurrences is in direct opposition to the scientific spirit of the age, nor is it the position practically occupied by the more intelligent portion of mankind at present. When people see wonders, nowadays, the sentiment excited in their minds is no longer veneration and awe, but curiosity. It was in the hope of arousing and utilizing this spirit of curiosity that occult phenomena were shown. It was believed that this manipulation of forces of nature which 48  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS li e below the surface—that surface of things which modern science scratches and pecks at so industriously and so proudly—would have led to enquiry into the nature and the laws of those forces, unknown to science, but perfectly known to occultism. That the phenomena did excite curiosity in the minds of those who witnessed them, is certainly true, but it was, unfortunately, for the most part, of an idle kind. The greater number of the witnesses developed an insatiable appetite for phenomena for their own sake, without any thought of studying the philosophy or the science of whose truth and power the phenomena were merely trivial and, so to say, accidental illustrations. In but a few cases the curiosity which was awakened gave birth to the serious desire to study the philosophy and the science themselves and for their own sake. Experience has taught the leaders of the movement that the vast majority of professing Christians are absolutely precluded by their mental condition and attitude—the result of centuries of superstitious teaching—from calmly examining the phenomena in their aspect of natural occurrences governed by law. The Roman Catholic Church, true to its traditions, excuses itself from the examination of any occult phenomena on the plea that they are necessarily the work of the Devil, whenever they occur outside of its own pale, since it has a lawful monopoly of the legitimate miracle business. The Protestant Church denies the personal intervention of the Evil One on the material plane; but, never having gone into the miracle business itself, it is apparently a little doubtful whether it would know a bona-fide miracle if it saw one, but, being just as unable as its elder sister to conceive the extension of the reign of law beyond the limits of matter and force as known to us in our present state of consciousness, it excuses itself from the study of occult phenomena on the plea that they lie within the province of science rather than of religion. Now science has its miracles as well as the Church of Rome. But, as it is altogether dependent upon its instrument-maker for the production of these miracles, and, as W HAT OF P HENOMENA ?   49 it claims to be in possession of the last known word in regard to the laws of nature, it was"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"hardly to be expected that it would take very kindly to “miracles,” in whose production apparatus has no part and which claim to be instances of the operation of forces and laws of which it has no knowledge. Modern science, moreover, labours under disabilities with respect to the investigation of the Occult quite as embarrassing as those of Religion; for, while Religion cannot grasp the idea of natural law as applied to the supersensuous Universe, Science does not allow the existence of any supersensuous universe at all to which the reign of law could be extended; nor can it conceive the possibility of any other state of consciousness than our present terrestrial one. It was, therefore, hardly to be expected that science would undertake the task it was called upon to perform with much earnestness and enthusiasm; and, indeed, it seems to have felt that it was not expected to treat the phenomena of occultism less cavalierly than it had treated divine miracles. So it calmly proceeded at once to pooh-pooh the phenomena; and when obliged to express some kind of opinion, it did not hesitate, without examination, and on hearsay reports, to attribute them to fraudulent contrivances—wires, trap-doors, and so forth. It was bad enough for the leaders of the movement when they endeavoured to call the attention of the world to the great and unknown field for scientific and religious enquiry which lies on the borderland between matter and spirit, to find themselves set down as agents of his Satanic Majesty, or as superior adepts in the charlatan line; but the unkindest cut of all, perhaps, came from a class of people whose own experiences, rightly understood, ought certainly to have taught them better: the occult phenomena were claimed by the Spiritualists as the work of their dear departed ones, but the leaders in Theosophy were declared to be somewhat less even than mediums in disguise. Never were the phenomena presented in any other character than that of instances of a power over perfectly natural though unrecognized forces, and incidentally over 50  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS ma tter, possessed by certain individuals who have attained to a larger and higher knowledge of the Universe than has been reached by scientists and theologians, or can ever be reached by them, by the roads they are now respectively pursuing. Yet this power is latent in all men, and could, in time, be wielded by anyone who would cultivate the knowledge and conform to the conditions necessary for its development. Nevertheless, except in a few isolated and honourable instances, never was it received in any other character than as would-be miracles, or as works of the Devil, or as vulgar tricks, or as amusing gape-seed, or as the performances of those dangerous “spooks” that masquerade in séance rooms, and feed on the vital energies of mediums and sitters. And, from all sides, theosophy and theosophists were attacked with a rancour and bitterness, with an absolute disregard alike of fact and logic, and with malice, hatred and uncharitableness that would be utterly inconceivable, did not religious history teach us what mean and unreasoning animals ignorant men become when their cherished prejudices are touched; and did not the history of scientific research teach us, in its turn, how very like an ignorant man a learned man can behave when the truth of his theories is called in question."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"An occultist can produce phenomena, but he cannot supply the world with brains, nor with the intelligence and good faith necessary to understand and appreciate them.

Both take the editors to task for using their undeniable right of criticism and editorial judgment. As Lucifer, however, is a magazine sui generis, and as its policy is the greatest possible tolerance and fairness to all parties concerned, it will abstain from its legal prerogative of leaving the letters without reply or notice. Lucifer hands them over, therefore, to the “A DVERSARY ,” to be dealt with ac cording to their respective merits. The editors have never pretended to an “understanding of Hylo-Idealism” nor do they entertain any such rash hope for the future. They belong to that humble class of mortals who labour to their dying day under the belief that 2 x 2 = 4, and can by no means, even hylo-idealistic, make 5. “C.

If in Mr. Huxley’s opinion Comte’s Positivism is, in practice, “Catholicism minus Christianity,” in the views of the editors of Lucifer Hylo-Idealism is “Metaphysics minus psychology and— physics .” Let its apostles explain away its flagrant contradictions, and then Lucifer will be the first to render justice to it as a philosophy. Meanwhile, it can only acknowledge a number of remarkably profound thoughts that are to be found scattered in independent solitude throughout the letters of Dr. Lewins ( Humanism versus Theism ) and others, and—no more. 52  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS RE HYLO-IDEALISM To the Editors of Lucifer."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Perhaps space may be found in the February or other early issue of your interesting and suggestive serial for the present curt communication. In a footnote of your January number I am coupled with Mr. H.

Now, that atheistic or non-animist standpoint is the pivot on which my whole synthesis revolves; and is, I contend, the burning problem at this epoch—ethical and intellectual—of the human mind— thoroughly to establish on certain concrete, rational and scientific data, that is to say—not on the Utopias of Speculation and Metaphysics. My principle is exactly that of Kant (inter alia) when he formulates the “Thing in Itself.” But we have only to study the short and handy A Critique of Kant, referred to in your columns—by Kuno Fischer, translated by Dr. Hough, to see how fast and loose that “all-shattering” metaphysician played with his all-destructive theme. Not only does he entirely reverse it and its corollaries in his critique of the “Practical Reason,” and of “Judgment,” but also in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason itself, in which originally, as its corollary, or rather concomitant, he, like myself, only on less sure premises, disposes of God, the Soul (Anima or Vital Principle), and Immortality—that is of another “personal” life after death. I hold with Lucretius, Epicurus, and others in ancient and modern times, of whom Shelley is a typical case, that no greater benefit can be bestowed on humanity than the elimination from sane thought of this ghastly and maddening Triune Spectre. God alone is quite “l’infâme” Voltaire dubs the Catholic Church. Looking through Nature “ red in tooth and claws “ to its pseudo -Author, we must expect to find a Pandemon. For any omnipotent Being who, unconditioned and unfettered in all respects, “ willed ” such a world of pain and anguish for sentient creatures, must be a Demon worse than mythology has fabled of Satan, Moloch, Mammon, or other fiends. It must be noted that in the classic Pantheon, the Fates, or Fatal Sisters, are “above” all the Immortals of Olympus, including Jove himself—a saving provision quite inadmissible in modern Monotheism, which endows its Divinity * with absolute omnipotence and fore-knowledge.

I have to thank you for your kind insertion of my note on above in January issue of the Magazine. I have not the slightest desire to quarrel with your prefaced comments on my style of writing. It seems to you to be “turgid,” and you take advantage of some unkind epithets lately dealt out to Theosophy in the Secular Review to return the compliment to me with interest added. Be it so. It would seem but fair to, let me say, compliment those, and those only, who have directly complimented you; but I have no wish, as I have just said, to find fault with any comment on Hylo-Idealism or on the methods of its advocacy. All criticism is, I know, received by the excogitator of the system with thanks, and, save that both he and I think your note re “ Theobroma ” not a little at fault (for explanation I refer you to the well-known Messrs. Epps), I can say the same for myself. I can see, however, in spite of the raillery with which you honour us, that a right understanding of Hylo-Idealism—I beg pardon, High-Low Idealism—is still very far from being yours. Why, in a recent issue of Lucifer , the old difficulty of, as I call it, the “Coincident assumption of Materiality” is started as if it had never before been thought of. It is, in point of fact, fully dealt with in my “Appendix” to the Auto-Centricism pamphlet, which has already passed under your review! It is not worth while to enter once more upon this point; suffice it then to say, in addition, that I explained it also, at full length, to a Theosophical writer—Mr. E. D.

He had started the same venerable objection, but"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"after my reply, he so far honoured me as not to return to the charge.

L EWINS , AND THE H YLO -I DEALISTS AT LARGE The several learned gentlemen of the above persuasion, who have honoured Lucifer wi th their letters and articles, will please to accept the present as a collective Reply. Life is too short to indulge very often in such lengthy explanations. But “une fois n’est pas coutume.” In “coupling” Dr. Lewins’ name with those he mentions—especially with Mr. Herbert Spencer’s—the Editors had assuredly no intention of saying anything derogatory to the dignity of the founder of Hylo-Idealism. They have called the latter system—its qualification of Idealistic notwithstanding—“atheistical,” and to this Dr. Lewins himself does not demur. Quite the contrary. If his protest (against a casual remark made in a footnote of two lines!) means anything at all, it means that he feels hurt to find his name associated with the names of such “compromising and [in atheism ] irresolute scientists as Darwin, Huxley, and Co.” What is it that our erudite correspondent demurs to, then? Just that, and nothing more. His prefixed adjectives refer to the half-heartedness of these gentlemen in the matter of atheism and materialism, not surely, to their scientific achievements Indeed, these illustrious naturalists are timid enough to leave half-opened doors in their speculations for something to enter in which is not quite matter, and yet what it is they do not, or do not wish to know. Indeed, they derive man, his origin and consciousness, only from the lower forms of animal creation and the brutes, instead of attributing life, mind and intellect—as the followers of the new System do—simply to the pranks played by Prakriti (the great Ignorance and Illusion) on our “diseased nervous centres”— abstract thought being synonymous with Neuropathy in the teachings of the Hylo-Idealists (see Auto-Centricism, p. 40). But all this has been already said and better said by Kapila, in his Sankhya, and is very old philosophy indeed; so that Messrs. Darwin and Co. have been, perhaps, wise in their generation to adopt another theory. Our great Darwinists are practical men, and avoid"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"running after the hare and the eagle at C ORRESPONDENCE   55 th e same time, as the hare in such case would be sure to run away, and the eagle to be lost in the clouds. They prefer to ignore the ideas and conceptions of the Universe, as held by such “loose,” and—as philosophically expressed by our uncompromising opponent—”all-shattering metaphysicians” as Kant was. Therefore letting all such “metaphysical crack-brained theories” severely alone, they made man and his thinking Ego the lineal descendant of the revered ancestor of the now tailless baboon, our beloved and esteemed first cousin. This is only logical from the Darwinian standpoint. What is, then, Dr. Lewins’ quarrel with these great men, or with us? They have their theory, the inventor of Hylo-Idealism has his theory, we, Metaphysicians, have our ideas and theories; and, the Moon shining with impartial and equal light on the respective occiputs of Hylo-Idealists, Animalists, and Metaphysicians, she pours material enough for every one concerned to allow each of them to “live and let live.” No man can be at once a Materialist and an Idealist, and remain consistent. Eastern philosophy and occultism are based on the absolute unity of the Root Substance, and they recognise only one infinite and universal C AUSE . Th e Occultists are U NITARIANS par excellence. But there is such a thing as conventional, ti me-honoured terms with one and the same meaning attached to them all—at any rate on this plane of illusion. And if we want to understand each other, we are forced to use such terms in their generally-accepted sense, and avoid calling mind matter, and vice versa. The definition of a materialised “ Spirit ” as frozen whiskey is in its place in a humouristic pun: it becomes an absurdity in philosophy. It is Dr. Lewins’ argument that “the very first principle of logic is, that two ‘causes’ are not to be thought of when one is sufficient”; and though the first and the ultimate, the Alpha and the Omega in the existence of the Universe, is one absolute cause, yet, on the plane of manifestations and differentiations, matter, as phenomenon, and Spirit as noumenon, cannot be so loosely confused as to merge the latter into the former, under the pretext that one self-evident natural cause (however secondary in the sight 56  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS o f logic and reason) is “sufficient for our purpose,” and we need not “transcend the proper conditions of thought” and fall back upon the lower level of “lawless and uncertain fancy”— i.e., metaphysics. ( Vide Humanism versus Theism, pp. 14-15.) We have nothing whatever, I say it again, against “Hylo-Idealism” with the exception of its compound and self-contradictory name. Nor do we oppose Dr. Lewins’ earlier thoughts, as embodied in “C. N.’s” Humanism versus Theism. That which we permit"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"ourselves to object to and oppose is the later system grown into a Bifrontian, Janus-like monster, a hybrid duality notwithstanding its forced mask of Unity. Surely it is not because Dr. Lewins calls “Spirit—a fiction ,” and attributes Mind, Thought, Genius, Intellect, and all the highest attributes of thinking man to simple effects or functions of Hylo-zoism, that the greatest problem of psychology, the relation of mind to matter , is solved? No one can accuse “The Adversary” of too much tenderness or even regard for the conclusions of such rank materialists as the Darwinians generally are. But surely no impartial man would attribute their constant failure to explain the relations of mind to matter, and the confessions of their ignorance of the ultimate constitution of that matter itself, to timidity and irresoluteness, but rather to the right cause: i.e., the absolute impossibility of explaining spiritual effects by physical causes, in the first case; and the presence of that in matter which baffles and mocks the efforts of the physical senses to perceive or feel, and therefore to explain it, in the second case. It is not, evidently, a desire to compromise that forced Mr. Huxley to confess that “in strictness we [the Scientists] know nothing about the composition of matter,” but the honesty of a man of science in not speculating upon what he did not believe in, and knew nothing about.

I say this in no impertinent mood; but merely following Dr. Lewins on his own lines of thought. As his expressions seem absolutely antiphrastic in meaning to those generally accepted by the common herd, “anti-intellectual” would mean with the Hylo-Idealists “anti-spiritual” (spirit being a fiction with them). Thus their Founder must have crossed the impassable chasm—say, by a hylo-zoistic process of perception, “starting from the region of rational cogitation” and not from “that lower level of lawless and uncertain fancy,” as Theosophists, Mystics, and other hoi polloi of thought, do. He has done it to his own “mental satisfaction,” and this is all a Hylo-Idealist will ever aspire to, as Dr. Lewins himself tells us. He “cannot deny that there may be behind [?] nature a ‘cause of causes,’ * but if so, it is a god who hides himself, or itself, from mortal thought. Nature is at all events vice-regent plenipotentiary, and with her thought has alone to deal.” Just so, and we say it too, for reasons given in the footnote. “There is a natural solution for everything,” he adds “Of course, if there be no ‘cause,’ this solution is the arrangement and co-ordination of invariable sequences in our own minds rather than an ‘explanation’ or ‘accounting for’ phenomena. Properly speaking we can ‘account for’ nothing. Mental satisfaction— unity between microcosm and macrocosm, not the search after ‘First Causes’. . . . is the true chief end of man. ” ( Humanism versus Theism , p. 15.) This seems the backbone of Hylo-Idealistic philosophy, which thus appears as a cross breed between Epicurianism and the “Illusionism” of the Buddhist Yogachâryas. This stands proven by the contradictions of his system. Dr. Lewins seems to have achieved that to do which every mortal scientist has hitherto failed firstly, by declaring (in Human. vs. Theism , p. 17) the –––––––––– * We Theosophists, who do not lim it nature, do not see the “cause of causes” or the unknowable deity behind that which is limitless, but identify that abstract Nature with the deity itself, and explain its visible"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"laws as secondary effects on the plane of Universal Illusion. –––––––––– C ORRESPONDENCE   59 wh ole objective world—“ phenomenal or ideal ,” * and “everything in it spectral ” ( Auto-Centricism , p. 9) , and yet admitting the reality of matter. More than this. In the teeth of all the scientific luminaries, from Faraday to Huxley, who all confess to knowing NOTHING of matter, he declares that———”Matter, organic or inorganic . . . is now fully kn own ” ( Auto-Centricism , p. 40)!! I humbly beg Dr. Lewins’ pardon for the rude question; but does he really mean to say what he does say? Does he want his readers to believe that up to his appearance in this world of matter, thinking men did not know what they were talking about, and that among all the “Ego Brains” of this globe his brain is the one omniscient reality, while all others arc empty phantasms, or spectral balloons? Besides which, matter cannot surely be real and unreal at the same time. If unreal— and he maintains it—then all Science can know about it is that it knows nothing, and this is precisely what Science confesses. And if real— and Dr. Lewins, as shown, declares it likewise—then his Idealism goes upside down, and Hylo alone remains to mock him and his philosophy. These may be trifling considerations in the consciousness of an Ego of Dr. Lewins’ power, but they are very serious contradictions, and also impediments in the way of such humble thinkers as Vedantins, Logicians, and Theosophists, toward recognising, let alone appreciating, “Hylo-Idealism.” Our learned correspondent pooh-poohs Metaphysics, and at the same time not only travels on purely metaphysical grounds, but adopts and sets forth the most metaphysical tenets, the very gist of the PARA -metaphysical Vedanta philosophy, tenets he ld also by the Buddhist “Illusionists” —the Yogachâryas and Madhyamikas. Both schools maintain that all is void ( sarva \u0001 ûnya ) , or that which Dr. Lewins calls spectral an d phantasmal. Except internal sensation or intelligence ( vijñâna ) the Yogachâryas regard everything else as illusion. Nothing that is material can have any but a spectral existence with them. So far, our “Bauddhas” are at one with the Hylo-Idealists, but they part at –––––––––– * We call the no umenal— the “ideal.” –––––––––– 60  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS th e crucial moment. The New School teaches that the Brain (the originator of consciousness) is the only factor and Creator of the visible Universe; that in it alone all our ideas of external things are born, and that, apart from it, nothing has real existence,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"everything being illusion. Now what has that Brain, or rather the material its particles and cells are composed of, distinct in it from other matter that it should be rendered such honours? Physically, it differs very little indeed from the brain stuff and cranium of any anthropoid ape. Unless we divorce consciousness, or the EGO , from matter, one ma t erialistic philosophy is as good as the other, and none is worth living for. What his Brain-Ego is, Dr. Lewins does not show anywhere. He urges that his “atheistic or non-animist (soulless) standpoint is the pivot ” on which his “whole synthesis revolves.” But as that “pivot” is no higher than the physical brain with its hallucinations, then it must be a broken reed indeed. A philosophy that goes no further than superficial Agnosticism, and says that “what Tennyson says of Deity may be true, but it is not in the region of natural cogitation; for it transcends the logical Encheiresis naturae ” ( Human. vs. Theism )—is no philosophy, but simply unqualified negation. And one who teaches that “ savants, or specialists, are the last to reach the summa scientiae, for the constant search after knowledge must ever prevent its fruition ” ( ibid. ), cuts the ground himself under his feet, and thus loses the right. not only to be considered a man of science, but likewise his claim to the title of philosopher, for he rejects all knowledge. Dr. Lewins, quoting Schiller, to the effect that truth can never be reached while the mind is in its analytic throes, shows the poet-philosopher saying that:—“To capture the fleeting phantom he (the analyst) must fetter it by rules, must anatomatise its fair body into concepts, and imprison its living spirit into a bare skeleton of words”—and thus brings this as a prop and proof of his own arguments that we need not trouble ourselves with the “cause of causes.” But Schiller believed in spirit and immortality, while the Hylo-Idealists deny them in toto. What he says above is accepted by every Occultist and "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME IX February, 1888 C ORRESPONDENCE   6 1 Theosophist, simply because he refers to the purely intellectual (not Spiritual) analysis on the physical plane, and according to the present scientific methods. Such analysis, of course, will never help man to reach the real inner soul-knowledge, but must ever leave him stranded in the bogs of fruitless speculation. The truth is, that Hylo-Idealism is at best QUIETISM — only on the purely material plane. “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die,” seems its motto. Dr. Lewins tells us that he holds his views with Epicurus. I beg leave to contradict again. Epicurus insisted upon the necessity of making away with an unphilosophical, anthropomorphic deity—a bundle of` contradictions—and so do we, the Theosophists. But Epicurus believed in gods, finite and conditioned in space and time, still divine when compared to objective ephemeral man: again, just as we, Theosophists, believe in them. We feel sorry to have to say unpleasant truths. The Founder of Hylo-Idealism is evidently a marvellously well-read man, his learning is great and undeniable; and, we have always had an instinctive respect for, and sympathy with, thinkers of his calibre. But, we have been sent pamphlets and books on Hylo-Idealism for review, and one would be truant to his duty to conceal one’s honest and sincere views on anything. Therefore, we say that, contradictions and inconsistencies in the Hylo-Idealistic system apart, we find in it a mass of ideas and arguments which come forcibly home to us, because they are part and parcel of the Eastern Idealism. Our premises and propositions seem to be almost identical in some respects, but the conclusions we come to disagree in every point, the most important of which is the true nature of matter. This, which “has been fabled as ‘Spirit,’ ” writes Dr. Lewins in 1878, “is really merely the ‘ vis insita ’ of matter or ‘nature’—the latter a misnomer if creation or birth is a delusion, as it must be on the hypothesis of the eternity of matter.” Here the Doctor speaks evidently of “Spirit” from the Christian stand-point, and criticises it from this aspect. And from this stand-point and aspect he is perfectly right; 62  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS but as wrong from those of Eastern philosophy. Did he but view Spirit, as one with eternal matter, which, though eternal in esse is but finite and conditioned during its periodical manifestations, he would not so materialise its vis insita— which is vis vitae but when applied to individual manifestations, the living subjects of illusion, or animated bodies. But this would lead us too far, and we must close the subject with one more protest.

II, No. 7, March, 1888, pp. 1-5] The following is an extract from the Daily Telegraph of March 1st, and may speak for it self:— At yesterday’s sitting of the Upper House of the Convocation of Canterbury, the Archbishop presiding, the Bishop of Exeter laid on the table a petition which sets forth:—“That there has been of late a very marked increase in the employment of the afternoon and evening of the Lord’s Day in amusements of various kinds by the upper and fashionable classes of Society. That the Society papers (so-called) in particular, and occasionally the daily papers on Monday, give more or less full accounts of entertainments which have taken place. Those of recent date include formal dinner-parties, smoking concerts, theatrical and semi-theatrical performances, comic recitations, and amusing programmes of fun and frolic, exhibitions of jugglery, Sunday parade in Hyde Park, coach drives of clubs, the drags assembling at Hampton Court, Richmond, and other places of resort, the ‘Sunday up the river,’ boxing at the Pelican Club, lawn tennis, dances at clubs and private houses, exhibitions (once at least) of the Wild West Show, and Show Sunday in the studios of artists. Some of these are novelties in the way of Lord’s Day profanation. That the long lists of those present at these Sunday amusements, which are given in the Society papers, embrace men of eminence in art, science, politics and commerce, as well as mere dilettanti, and of men and women whose prominence is only that of devotion to pleasure. That many of these amusements are public, that their prevalence testifies to very loose Sunday habits on the part of the rich, and great, and noble of the land. Such abuses of the Lord’s Day evidence an insatiable desire for distraction and dissipation, a very low regard for the claims of the Word of God, and the determination to put away the restraints of religion.” The petitioners, who numbered 104, asked counsel on the subject, and suggested a protest against Sunday excursion trains, and a remonstrance against Sunday amusements and entertainments. The signatories included members of both Houses of Parliament, clergymen, and others. A discussion which arose on the question was adjourned till to-morrow, it being considered that the Bishop of London, who was absent yesterday, should be present, since it was in his diocese that the alleged Sunday desecration had been committed. The debate was resumed on the following Friday, when the Bishop of London was pr esent. His Lordship at once addressed the House, and declared his conviction that the state of affairs was not very much exaggerated. But as S UNDAY D EVOTION TO P LEASURE  67 re gards the especial prevalence in his diocese of this “desecration,” he was of opinion that it was a consequence of the gathering together in London, during “the Season,” of people"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"who carried similar practices into effect while in the country, and that greater attention was attracted to them by “the so-called Society papers.” His Lordship regarded the “pursuit of pleasure” on Sunday as much less excusable in the upper classes than in the lower, “where there is unremitting toil through the week, and where the other aspect of Sunday—namely, that it is a day of rest from toil—must necessarily take up a very much larger space in their thoughts than the character of it as a day of worship.” His Lordship was rather doubtful as to the efficacy of the protest, wisely considering that “protests of this kind, if they are allowed to be issued and fall flat, are likely to do rather more harm than good.” The Bishop of Exeter—the spokesman of the petitioners —followed with a long extract from the pages of The Bat , a paper which, by the way, is now defunct. He considered that a simple statement that the Upper House had had its attention called to the state of affairs, and that it was of opinion that it “was derogatory to the spiritual and moral health of all ranks of the people of this country,” would “satisfy those who are anxious for the maintenance of the Lord’s Day.” The Bishop of Winchester made remarks on the difference between the Sabbaths of the Jews and Christians and agreed with the dictum that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. Further, he said that the relaxation of the strict Sabbath rule was, to some extent, justified by the New Testament. He also asserted that “the only form of civil government ever distinctly ordained by God was the government of the Jewish people, and that in this He ordained that the labours of the year should not be continuous, but that there should be one day’s rest in seven for every man.” The Bishop said that the memorial referred almost entirely to the Upper Classes, but that his experience in South London had shown him that a great amount of the neglect was originally caused by colonies of foreigners, and especially Germans, who had 68  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS ga thered in that part of London. Therefore, he thought that the neglect had penetrated every class of Society; and he agreed with his right reverend brother of London in thinking that the day of rest was necessary to the working man, but did not see what other time he had for observances of a religious nature. While he thought that over-strictness in Sabbatarianism had an injurious effect, as in Scotland, he was convinced that any further relaxation in this country would be still more injurious. The House was in committee on the subject for an hour, at which the reporters were not present. Finally, the following resolution was moved, and agreed to unanimously: That the attention of the Upper House of Convocation having been attracted to the relaxation of Sunday ob servance, which appears to have increased of late years, even among those who have the fullest leisure on other days, and to the great increase of Sunday labour, the House deems it to be its duty to appeal to the clergy, to all instructors of the young, and to all who exercise influence over their fellow-men, not to suffer this Church and country to lose the priceless benefit of the rest and sanctity of the Lord’s Day.* Its reasonable and religious observance is for the physical, moral, and spiritual health of all ranks of the population, and to it our national well-being has been largely due."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The foregoing is an abstract of the report in the Daily Telegraph of the debate in the Upper House of the Convocation of Canterbury.

But we do traverse one thing: the Sabbath was indeed ordained for man, but nothing was said, even in those statutes so especially “ordained by God for the Jews,” as to the religious observances on that especial day. It was essentially a day of REST , ordained for man, as it was ordained that the land should lie fa llow; that is to say, that there shall be no compulsory work for man, whether religious or secular. But granting that it is essentially a Day of Rest for overworked man, he is yet told by those who teach him religion that, instead of complete relaxation, he must follow “a religious observance.” We would ask whether this “religious observance” is to be a farce or a reality? If a reality, it is a labour more fatiguing than any ordinary work; for it is an unaccustomed toil, and one which all except the very pious willingly eschew. Clergymen, whose business in life it is to lead the services, and who should, therefore, get accustomed to the labour, are exhausted by the work they have to do on Sundays, and to “feel Mondayish,” has become a recognised expression. As for children, who are taken to church regardless of their age and nature, many of them positively hate “church-going,” and so learn a horror of religion itself. Thus there is a forced “education,” in religion, instead of religion being the natural growth of the noblest part of the human heart. We thus offer to God not the things which are His, but “the things which are Caesar’s”—the lip-service of humanity. The whole Sunday-question resolves itself into the demand to know whether it is in any degree right, or in accordance with divine law, that man should be so devoted to selfish toil, during the week, as to have virtually no time or strength left for prayer (i.e., meditation) during the six days, and whether, therefore, it is right that the seventh day or Sunday should be set apart for it. All depends upon whether doing one’s duty in the state of life to which one is called, is “doing,” or not doing, “all to the glory of God.” We think that work is prayer; and if so, the devotion of Sunday to innocent pleasure is really making it a day of rest."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 70  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Wh y should England set forth its observance of Sunday as the only one sanctioned by God? The present observance of Sunday in England is founded on the practices of the later and degenerate Jews, who were not upheld by Jesus in their observances. Even the prophets (vide Nehemiah , viii, 9-12) plainly show that the earlier usage was one of a day of rest, and that the idea of innocent pleasure, which is now represented as rather gross and sensual, was not then a forbidden thing. Reference to statistics in matters of drunkenness and crime does not show that England is, indeed, in possession of priceless benefits owing to the observance of` Sunday, in which other nations, who do not share that observance, do not partake. Indeed it is by no means certain that in all those countries where there is indulgence in the class of pleasures so energetically condemned in the petition, there is not less crime and drunkenness than exists in England; and this, too, not merely during the week, but especially on the Sundays. Without speaking of Catholic France, Spain, Italy, etc., etc., Greek orthodox Russia and all the Slavonian lands, take for example Protestant Germany, where all places of amusement are, if anything, more freely open than on other days, and Sunday is considered the best day for theatres, balls, and popular festivities. Surely the other nations, especially the Germans, are not less religious than in England. To many who are cooped up during the week, a day in the country is an education which brings them nearer to God than all the services they could attend in a church. Of course, we may be met with a reference to the “two or three gathered together,” but surely if God is omnipresent, He is with those who are truly grateful for the beauties of Nature. No, my Lords, your protest may not fall flat, but it does not strike at the root of the evil:—the fact that you are unable to cope with the increasingly material conditions of life during the present age.

You will not get anyone to follow S UNDAY D EVOTION TO P LEASURE  71 yo ur religious observances among those who have broken free from them, unless you can convince them that you are right, and that religion must be made the vital factor in their lives. Many of them recognise no “hereafter,” and gaily follow the motto:—“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” They recognise no god save their own pleasure; and we are both agreed that they are endeavouring to execute a “valse à deux temps” to the tune of the “danse macabre.” Among the ranks of your church are many self-sacrificing men, who, from various motives, are endeavouring to help those of the working classes whose lives are lost in toil.

You, in your"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Convocation, are protesting against an evil of which you are conscious, but against which you are powerless to act. Why? Because the form of religion you rely on has lost its hold upon the hearts of the people, and the “Service of Man,” according to the late Mr. James A.

The people have educated themselves to ask “Why?” And they will have an answer, or they will reject the Church and its teachings, for they will not accept authority. Religion and its principles must be demonstrated as mathematically as a problem of Euclid. But are you able to do so? Are any of the Church’s dogmas worth any of the tenets of Christ’s Sermon on the Mount, or the similar utterances to be found in all religions? Do you carry them out in their entirety in your lives, as the Episcopi of the Church? Do you, as such, take care that all your clergy do so? You may reply with a counter-question:—“Do you, our critics, do so and set us an example?” Our answer is, that we do not claim to be the “elect” or the “anointed of the Lord.” We are unpretending men and women, endeavouring to carry out the Golden Rule, apart from the ordinances of any form of worship.

II, No. 7, March, 1888, pp. 37-42] A few years back a very interesting controversy raged between several scientists of re putation. Some of these held that spontaneous generation was a fact in nature, whilst others proved the contrary; to the effect that, as far as experiments went, there was found to be biogenesis, or generation of life from previously existing life, and never the production of any form of life from non-living matter. An erroneous assumption was made in the first instance that heat, equal to the boiling point of water, destroyed all life organisms; but by taking hermetically sealed vessels containing infusions, and subjecting them to such or a greater degree of heat, it was shown that living organisms did appear even after the application of so much heat. By more careful experiments, the following fact was brought to light, that spores of Bacteria, and other animalculae, which generally float in the air, can, when dry, withstand a greater degree of heat, and that when the experiments are made in optically pure air, no life ever appears, and the infusions never putrefy. Along with the fact of biogenesis, we must note, however, Mr. Huxley’s caution, when he says, “that with organic chemistry, molecular physics, and physiology yet in their infancy, and every day making prodigious strides, it would be the height of presumption for any man to say that the conditions under which matter assumes the T HE L IFE P RINCIPLE  73 qu alities called vital, may not some day be artificially brought together”; and, again, “that as a matter not of proof, but of probability, if it were given me to look beyond the abyss of geologically recorded time, to the still more remote period, when the earth was passing through chemical and physical conditions which it can never see again, I should expect to be a witness of the evolution of living protoplasms from non-living matter.” Tracing inorganic matter upwards to the form which approaches most nearly to vital organisms, we come to those complex substances called “colloids,” which are something like the white of an egg, and form the last stage of the ascending line from inorganic matter to organic life. Tracing life downwards we ultimately reach “protoplasm,” called by Huxley “the physical basis of life,” a colourless, jelly-like substance, absolutely homogeneous without parts or structure. Protoplasm is evidently the nearest approach of life to matter; and if life ever originated from atomic and molecular combinations, it was in this form."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Protoplasm in its substance is a nitrogenous carbon compound, differing only from other similar compounds of the albuminous family of colloid by the extremely complex composition of` its atoms.

The law of evolution has now been satisfactorily proved to pervade the whole of the Universe, but there are several missing links, and, doubtless, the discoveries of modern science will in course of time bring many new facts to light on these obscure points which at present defy all search. Far more important than the question of the origin of species is the great problem of the development of life from what is looked upon as the inanimate mineral kingdom. Every discovery of science, however limited it may be, affords food for thought, and enables us to understand how far we are to believe on the ground of observation and experiment, and how far we theorize in the right direction. Science has not been able to prove the fact of “spontaneous generation” by experiment, but the best of scientists think it safe to believe that there must have been spontaneous generation * at one time. Thus far, scientific thought is in accord with esoteric teachings. Occult philosophy has it, that motion, cosmic matter, duration, space, are everywhere.

Were it to become, we will not say absent, for this is impossible, since it is omnipresent, but for one single instant inactive, say in a stone, the particles of the latter would lose instantly their cohesive property and disintegrate as suddenly—though the force would still remain in each of its particles, but in a dormant state. Thus the continuation of the sentence which states that, when this indestructible force is “disconnected with one set of atoms, it becomes attracted immediately by others” does not imply that it abandons entirely the first set, but only that it transfers its vis viva or living power, the energy of motion, to another set. But because it manifests itself in the next set as what is called Kinetic energy, it does not follow that the first set is deprived of it altogether; for it is still in it, as potential energy, or life latent.* More than any other, the life principle in man is one with which we are most familiar, an d yet are so hopelessly ignorant as to its nature. Matter and force are ever found allied. Matter without force, and force without matter, are inconceivable.

The expression in Five Years of Theosophy must be misleading, if it led to such an inference. It is only each body—whether man, beast, plant, insect, bird, or mineral—which, in assimilating more or less the life principle, differentiates it in its own special atoms, and adapts it to this or another combination of particles, which combination determines the differentiation. The monad partaking in its universal aspect of the Parabrahmic nature, unites with its monas on the plane of differentiation to constitute an individual. This individual, being in its essence inseparable from Parabrahm, also partakes of the Life-Principle in its Parabrahmic or Universal Aspect. Therefore, at the death of a man or an animal, the manifestation of life or the evidences of Kinetic energy are only withdrawn to one of those subjective planes of existence which are not ordinarily objective to us. The amount of Kinetic energy to be expended during life by one particular set of physiological cells is allotted by Karma—another aspect of the Universal Principle—consequently when this is expended the conscious activity of man or animal is no longer manifested on the plane of those cells, and the chemical forces which they represent are disengaged and left free to act in the physical plane of their manifestation. Jiva —in its universal aspect—has, like Prakriti, its seven forms, or what we have agreed to call “principles.” Its action begins on the plane of the Universal Mind ( Mahat ) and ends in the grossest of the Tanmatric five planes—the last one, which is ours. Thus though we may, repeating after Sankhya philosophy, speak of the seven prakritis (or “productive productions”) or after the phraseology of the Occultists of the seven jivas —yet, both Prakriti and Jiva are indivisible abstractions, to be divided only out of condescension for the weakness of our human intellect.

Richardson, F.R.S.—or call it this, that, or the other. The learned Dr. Richardson—an eminent authority—goes further than words, for he speaks of the life-principle as of “a form of MATTER ”(!!). Says the great man of science: “I speak only of a veritable material agent, re fined, it may be, to the T HE L IFE P RINCIPLE   79 wo rld at large, but actual and substantial: an agent having quality of weight and of volume; an agent susceptible of chemical combination, and thereby of change of physical state and condition; an agent passive in its action, moved always, that is to say, by influences apart from itself, obeying other influences; an agent possessing no initiative power, no vis , or energia naturae , but still playing a most important, if not a primary part in the production of the phenomena resulting from the action of the energia upon visible matter” * As one sees, the Doctor plays at blind man’s buff with occultism, and describes admirably the passive “life-elementals” used, say, by great sorcerers to animate their homunculi . Still the F.R.S . describes one of the countless aspects of our “subtle su persensous-matter-life-principle.” (2) And the Hindu philosophers are right. It is here that we have real need of the divisions of everything—Prakriti, Jiva, etc.—into principles to enable us to explain the action of Jiva on our low planes without degrading it. Thence, while the Vedantin philosopher may be content with four principles in his universal Kosmogony, we occultists need at least seven to enable ourselves to understand the difference of the Protean nature of the life-principle once it acts on the five lower spheres or planes. Our readers, enamoured with Modern Science, at the same time as with the occult doctrines—have to choose between the two views of the nature of the Life-Principle, which are the most accepted now, and—the third view—that of the occult doctrines. The three may be described as follows: I. That of the scientific “molecularists” who assert that life is the resultant of the interplay of ordinary molecular forces . II. That which regards “living organisms” as animated by an independent “vital principle,” and declares “inorganic” matter to be lacking this. –––––––––– * [ T heory of a Nervous Ether , p. 363.] –––––––––– 80  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" III.

There is more than one re ason for this. First of all, our readers can feel but little interest in the matter; and the majority (an enormous one) having approved of Lucifer’s “L ETTER ,” one solitary opponent who di ssents from that majority must be an authority indeed, to claim the right to be heard. Now, as he is by no means an authority, especially in the question raised, since he is not even an orthodox Christian , “sincere, if not over-wise,” and since he only expresses his personal opinion, we do not see why we should inflict upon our subscribers that opinion—however honest it may be—when the majority of other personal opinions is unanimous in holding quite an opposite view? Again, although the principle on which our magazine is and has always been conducted, is to admit to its columns every criticism when just and impartial, on our teachings, doctrines, and even on the policy and doings of the theosophical body, yet we can hardly be required to sacrifice the limited space in our Monthly to the expression of every opinion, whether good, bad, or indifferent. Then, it so happens that the two chief characteristics of our critic’s letter are: ( a ) a weakness in argument which makes it almost painful to read; and ( b ) personal rudeness, not to say abuse, which cannot in any way be material to the argument.

But this letter contains nothing of the kind. So we shall deal with the subject in general, and notice but a few sentences from it. Surprised to find that our now famous “Letter” has called forth no comment in our pages the writer remarks:— Containing, as it did, such an unwarrantable attack on the institution of which he [the Archbishop] is the he ad, perhaps had the matter been allowed to rest, and the article allowed to die a natural death, no comment would have appeared necessary; but as Theosophists have thought it necessary to republish their folly, and fling it before the world, like a “ Red rag ” to a Bull, it is, I consider, high time that some one, at least, should endeavour to dissuade them from the foolishly suicidal policy they are pursuing. The “folly” is the reprinting of the “Letter” in 15,000 copies, sent all over the world. No w this “folly” and “foolishly suicidal policy” were resorted to just in consequence of the masses of letters received by us, all thanking Lucifer for showing a courage no one else was prepared to show; and for stating publicly and openly that which is repeated and complained of ad nauseam in secret and privacy by the whole world, save by blind bigots. With an inconsistency worthy of regret the writer himself admits it. For he says: No one can deny, of course, that the article in question contained in its underlying spirit much that was tru e, especially in some of the remarks relative to a narrow and dogmatic Christianity, which we know to exist, and which has been realized by, and lamented often within the pale of the Church itself; and which all good and wide-minded Christians themselves deplore and fight against—so that Theosophy is not a discoverer here of any new truth! Thus, after admitting virtually the truth and justice of what we said in our “L ETTER ,” th e writer can take us to task only for not being the “D ISCOVERERS ” of that truth! Was the po inting out of slavery in the United States as an infamous institution, supported and defended by the Church, Bishops and Clergy—any discovery of a new truth? And are the Northern States which broke it by F ROM L UCIFER TO A F EW R EADERS  83"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" waving that infamy as a “Red rag” before the Southern Bull to be accused of folly? More than one misguided, though probably sincere critic, has accused them of “foolishly suicidal policy.” Time and success have avenged the noble States, that fought for human freedom, against a Church, which supported on the strength of a few idiotic words placed in Noah’s mouth against Ham, the most fiendish law that has ever been enacted; and their detractors and critics must have looked— very silly, after the war. Our critic tries to frighten us in no measured language. Speaking of the “L ETTER ” as an ar ticle:— Whose writer seems to have steeped his pen in the gall of a scurrility worthy of the correspondence of a ten th-rate society journal, —he asks us to believe:— That such an article is only calculated to bring what should be a great and noble work into the contempt of the entire thinking community—a contempt from which it will never rise again! No truth spoken in earnest sincerity can ever bring the speaker of it into contempt, ex cept, perhaps, with one class of men: those who selfishly prefer their personal reputation, the benefits they may reap with the majority which profits by and lives on crying social evils, rather than openly fight the latter. Those again, who will uphold every retrograde notion, however injurious, only because it has become part and parcel of national custom; and who will defend cant— that which Webster and other dictionaries define as “whining, hypocritical pretensions to goodness”—even while despising it—rather than risk their dear selves against the above mentioned howling majority. The Theosophical Society, or rather the few working members of it in the West, court such “contempt,” and feel proud of it. We are told further:— Should his Grace have de igned to answer your article, I presume he would have replied somewhat in this wise. “I have to provide spiritual food for upwards of 22,000,000 souls, of whom probably upwards of 20,000,000 are ignorant people without the power of thought, and certainly without the smallest capacity for grasping an abstract idea; can you provide me with any better form of Esoteric machinery for feeding and supplying them?” Theosophy answers, “No”! ! ! 84  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Th r ee answers are given to the above: ( a ) Somebody higher than even his “Grace”—his Master, in fact, “deigned” to answer even those who sought to crucify Him, and is said to have made his best friends of publicans and sinners. Why should not the Bishop of Canterbury answer our article? Because, we say, it is unanswerable. ( b ) We maintain that the majority of the 20,000,000 receives a stone instead of the bread of life (the “spiritual food”). Otherwise, whence the ever-growing materialism, atheism and disgust for the dead-letter of the purely ritualistic Church and its Theology? ( c ) Give theosophy half the means at the command of the Primates of all England and"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"their Church, and then see whether it would not find a “better form” and means to relieve the starving and console the bereaved. Therefore, our critics have no right, so far, having no knowledge what theosophy would do, had it only the means—to answer for it—“No.” Theosophy is able, at any rate, to furnish “His Grace” if he but asks the question suggested by our critics—“Yes, theosophy can provide you with a better form . . . . for feeding the multitudes, both physically and spiritually.” To do this is easy. It only requires that the Primates and Bishops, Popes and Cardinals, throughout the world should become the Apostles of Christ practically, instead of remaining priests of Christ, nominally. Let them each and all, the Lord Primate of England starting the noble example, give up their gigantic salaries and palaces, their useless paraphernalia and personal as well as Church luxury. The Son of Man “hath not where to lay his head ” [ Matt., viii, 20], and like the modern priests of Buddha, the highest as the lowest, had but one raiment over his body for all property; whereas again—God “dwelleth not in temples made with hands,” says Paul.* Let the Church, we say, become –––––––––– * [Reference is here made to the passage in H e brews , ix, 24, which runs thus: “ For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true . . .”— Compiler .] –––––––––– F ROM L UCIFER TO A F EW R EADERS  85 re ally the Church of Christ, and not merely the State-Church. Let Archbishops and Bishops live henceforth, if not as poor, homeless, and penniless, as Jesus was, at least, as thousands of their starving curates do. Let them turn every cathedral and church into hospitals, refuges, homes for the homeless, and secular schools; preach as Christ and the Apostles are said to have preached: in the open air, under the sunny and starry vault of heaven, or in portable tents, and teach people daily morality instead of incomprehensible dogmas. Are we to be told that if all the gigantic Church revenues, now used to embellish and build churches, to provide Bishops with palaces, carriages, horses, and flunkies, their wives with diamonds and their tables with rich viands and wines; are we to be told that if all those moneys were put together, there could be found in England one starving man, woman, or child? NEVER ! To c onclude:–– Our opponents seem to have entirely missed the point of our article, and to have, in consequence, wandered very far afield. As a further result, our latest critic seems to give vent to his criticism from a point of view very much more hostile than that he complains of. As his criticism is in general terms, and does not deal with any mistakes and inaccuracies, we content ourselves with pointing out, to him and all other assailants, what we hoped was plain—the real purport of our letter to the Archbishop.

Many persons are now in doubt 86  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS wh ether religion is a human institution or a divine one; this because the Church has lost the “keys” to the “mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,” and is unable to help people to enter therein. Moreover “the Doctrine of Atonement,” and the denunciatory Athanasian tenet, “he that believeth not shall be damned,” are, to many, so absolutely repulsive that they will not listen at all. Witness the Rev. T. G. Headley and his recent articles in Lucifer. Finally, our assailant’s ill-veiled personal attacks on the leaders of the Theosophical movement are beside the mark. To demand that those leaders should, as evidence of their faith, take part in “good works,” or philanthropy, when with all the sincere good-will, they lack the means, is equivalent to taunting them with their poverty. All honour to the clergy, in spite of the “black sheep” amongst them, for their self-sacrificing efforts. But the Church, as such, fails to do the duty which is required of it. To do this duty adequately, exoteric religion must have esoteric Knowledge behind it. Hence the clergy must study Theosophy and become, though not necessarily members of the Society, practical Theosophists. –––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME IX March, 1888 RE THE BRAIN THEOREM OF THE UNIVERSE [ Lucifer , Vol. II, No. 7, March, 1888, p. 71] To the Editors of Lucifer.

At page 510, 2nd column, of Lucifer for February, is the following passage: “In the teeth of all the scientific luminaries, from Faraday to Huxley, who all confess to knowing NOTHING [which is su rely rather too much of a negation] (I) of matter, [Dr. Lewins] declares that—’Matter organic and inorganic, is now fully known ’ ” ( Auto-Centricism, page 40).

As soon as he demonstrated innate activity or attractive energy, the push and pull of every atom of matter, the intrusion of a ‘spiritual’ agency was at once abrogated.” Indeed, it really is quite unthinkable to predicate the interaction of such incompatible el ements (concepts) as corporeity and incorporeity. Cui bono nerves or other somatic structures, for the conduction of an unsubstantial substance (Archaeus)? The idea is as inconceivable as inexpressible.

ANNA KINGSFORD, M. D. OBITUARY O BITUARY [ Lu cifer, Vol. II, No. 7, March, 1888, pp. 78-79] We have this month to record with the deepest regret the passing away from this ph ysical world of one who, more than any other, has been instrumental in demonstrating to her fellow-creatures the great fact of the conscious existence—hence of the immortality—of the inner Ego. We speak of the death of Mrs. Anna Kingsford, M.D ., which occurred on Tuesday, the 28 th of February, after a somewhat painful and prolonged illness. Few women have worked harder than she has, or in more noble causes; none with more success in the cause of humanitarianism. Hers was a short but a most useful life. Her intellectual fight with the vivisectionists of Europe, at a time when the educated and scientific world was more strongly fixed in the grasp of materialism than at any other period in the history of civilisation, alone proclaims her as one of those who, regardless of conventional thought, have placed themselves at the very focus of the controversy, prepared to dare and brave all the consequences of their temerity. Pity and Justice to animals were among Mrs. Kingsford’s favourite texts when dealing with this part of her life’s work; and by reason of her general culture, her special training in the science of medicine, and her magnificent intellectual power, she was enabled to influence and work in the way she desired upon a very large proportion of those people who listened to her words or who read her writings. Few women wrote more graphically, more takingly, or possessed a more fascinating style. Mrs. Kingsford’s field of activity, however, was not limited to the purely physical, mundane plane of life. She was a Theosophist and a true one at heart; a leader of spiritual and philosophical thought, gifted with most exceptional psychic attributes. In connection with Mr. Edward Maitland, her truest friend—one whose incessant, 90  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS wa tchful care has undeniably prolonged her delicate ever-threatened life for several years, and who received her last breath—she wrote several books dealing with metaphysical and mystical subjects. The first and most important was The Perfect Way, or the Finding of Christ, which gives the esoteric meaning of Christianity. It sweeps away many of the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"difficulties that thoughtful readers of the Bible must contend with in their endeavours to either understand or accept literally the story of Jesus Christ as it is presented in the Gospels. She was for some time President of the “London Lodge” of the Theosophical Society, and, after resigning that office, she founded “The Hermetic Society” for the special study of Christian mysticism. She herself, though her religious ideas differed widely on some points from Eastern philosophy, remained a faithful member of the Theosophical Society and a loyal friend to its leaders.* She was one, the aspirations of whose whole life were ever turned toward the eternal and the true. A mystic by nature—the most ardent one to those who knew her well—she was still a very remarkable woman even in the opinion of the materialists and the unbelievers. For, besides her remarkably fine and intellectual face, there was that in her which arrested the attention of the most unobserving and foreign to any metaphysical speculation. For, as Mrs. F. Fenwick Miller writes, though Mrs. Kingsford’s mysticism was “simply unintelligible” to her, yet we find that this does not prevent the writer from perceiving the truth. As she describes her late friend, “I have never known a woman so exquisitely beautiful as she who cultivated her brain so assiduously....

The world in general has lost in Mrs. Kingsford one who can be very ill-spared in this era of materialism. The whole of her adult life was passed in working unselfishly for others, for the elevation of the spiritual side of humanity. We can, however, in regretting her death take comfort in the thought that good work cannot be lost nor die, though the worker is no longer among us to watch for the fruit. And Anna Kingsford’s work will be still bearing fruit even when her memory has been obliterated with the generations of those who knew her well, and new generations will have approached the psychic mysteries still nearer. –––––––––– Catholic,” is utterly false.

We have preserved this and several other letters, as they were all written between September, 1887 and January, 1888.

Well, may they prosper better in the bosom of Abraham than they are likely to in that of Christ. But there is a little difficulty in the way. Ecclesiastical History teaches, and profane science does not deny, that since the days of Tiglath-pileser, who carried three tribes and one-half a tribe beyond the Euphrates ( 2 Kings , xv, 29; 1 Chron. , v, 26); and Shalmanaser, King of Assyria, who carried also beyond the Euphrates the rest of the tribes, there was “the end of the Kingdom of the ten tribes of Israel.” In other words, no one heard of them any longer. “The tribes never did return,” the good old Crudens tells us.

I have seen mediums (for “fire and flame phenomena” as they are called in America) take burning live coals in their hands and closing their fingers upon them never even get a burn. I have seen others handle red-hot and white-hot lamp-glasses, pokers, and have heard from several trustworthy eye-witnesses that the medium D. D.

And having seen all this, and heard all this, what am I to think, when I find Isaiah saying (vi, 6), “Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the TONGS from off the altar.” Qu ery: Why such precautions? Why should a seraph need tongs ? A seraph is higher than a common angel—for he is an angel of the highest order in the celestial hierarchy. Moreover, the plural of the word seraph means “burning, fiery,” hence of the same nature as the fire.

The difference between the fish and fowls cereals, plants and whales, and other marketable product of sea and land of the Heathen, and those of the Christian, seems quite imperceptible to an unbiassed mind.

Some theosophists seem to abhor it as if wishing to be taken away from it altogether, inveighing against modern inventions such as the telegraph, railways, machinery, and the like, and bewailing the disappearance of former civilizations. Others take a different view, insisting that this is a better time than any other, and hailing modern methods as the best. Tell me, please, which of these is right, or, if both are wrong, what ought we to know about the age we live in. Sage .—The teachers of Truth know all about this age. But they do not mistake the present century for the whole cycle. The older times of European history, for example, when might was right and when darkness prevailed over Western nations, was as much a part of this age, from the standpoint of the Masters, as is the present hour, for the Yuga—to use a Sanskrit word—in which we are now had begun many thousands of years before. And during that period of European darkness, although this Yuga had already begun, there was much light, learning, and civilization in India and China. The meaning of the words “present age” must therefore be extended over a far greater period than is at present assigned. In fact, modern science has reached no definite conclusion yet as to what should properly be called “an age,” and the truth of the Eastern doctrine is denied. Hence we find writers speaking 100  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS of the “Golden Age,” the “Iron Age,” and so on, whereas they are only parts of the real age that began so far back that modern archaeologists deny it altogether. Student.— What is the Sanskrit name for this age, and what is its meaning? Sage .—The Sanskrit is “Kali,” which added to Yuga gives us “Kali-Yuga.” The meaning of it is “Dark Age.” Its approach was known to the ancients, its characteristics are described in the Indian poem the Mahabharata. As I said that it takes in an immense period of the glorious part of Indian history, there is no chance for anyone to be jealous and to say that we are comparing the present hour with that wonderful division of Indian development. Student .—What are the characteristics to which you refer, by which Kali-Yuga may be known? Sage .—As its name implies, darkness is the chief. This of course is not deducible by comparing to-day with 800 A.D ., for this would be no comparison at all. The present"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"century is certainly ahead of the middle ages, but as compared with the preceding Yuga it is dark. To the Occultist, material advancement is not of the quality of light, and he finds no proof of progress in merely mechanical contrivances that give comfort to a few of the human family while the many are in misery. For the darkness he would have to point but to one nation, even the great American Republic. Here he sees a mere extension of the habits and life of the Europe from which it sprang; here a great experiment with entirely new conditions and material was tried; here for many years very little poverty was known; but here to-day there is as much grinding poverty as anywhere, and as large a criminal class with corresponding prisons as in Europe, and more than in India. Again, the great thirst for riches and material betterment, while spiritual life is to a great extent ignored, is regarded by us as darkness. The great conflict already begun between the wealthy classes and the poorer is a sign of darkness. Were spiritual light prevalent, the rich and the poor would still be with us, for Karma cannot be blotted out, but the poor would know how to accept their lot and the rich how to improve the poor; now, on the contrary, C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  101 t h e rich wonder why the poor do not go to the poorhouse, meanwhile seeking in the laws for cures for strikes and socialism, and the poor continually growl at fate and their supposed oppressors. All this is of` the quality of spiritual darkness. Student.— Is it wise to inquire as to the periods when the cycle changes, and to speculate on the great astronomical or other changes that herald a turn? Sage.— It is not. There is an old saying that the gods are jealous about these things, not wishing mortals to know them. We may analyse the age, but it is better not to attempt to fix the hour of a change of cycle. Besides that, you will be unable to settle it, because a cycle does not begin on a day or year clear of any other cycle; they inter-blend, so that, although the wheel of one period is still turning, the initial point of another has already arrived. Student.— Are these some of the reasons why Mr. Sinnett was not given certain definite periods of years about which he asked? Sage .—Yes Student.— Has the age in which one lives any effect on the student; and what is it? Sage.— It has effect on everyone, but the student after passing along in his development feels the effect more than the ordinary man. Were it otherwise, the sincere and aspiring students all over the world would advance at once to those heights towards which they strive. It takes a very strong soul to hold hack the age’s heavy hand, and it is all the more difficult because that influence, being a part of the student’s larger life, is not so well understood by him. It operates in the same way as a structural defect in a vessel. All the inner as well as the outer fibre of the man is the result of` the long centuries of earthly lives lived here by his ancestors. These sow seeds of thought and physical tendencies in a way that you cannot comprehend. All those tendencies affect him.

Further yet are the peculiar alterations brought about in the astral world. It, being at once a photographic plate, so to say, and also a 102  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS re flector, has become the keeper of the mistakes of ages past which it continually reflects upon us from a plane to which most of us are strangers. In that sense therefore, free as we suppose ourselves, we are walking about completely hypnotized by the past, acting blindly under the suggestions thus cast upon us. Student.— Was that why Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do ”? Sage.— That was one meaning. In one aspect they acted blindly, impelled by the age, thinking they were right. Regarding these astral alterations, you will remember how in the time of Julian the seers reported that they could see the gods, but they were decaying, some headless, others flaccid, others minus limbs, and all appearing weak. The reverence for these ideals was departing, and their astral pictures had already begun to fade. Student.— What mitigation is there about this age? Is there nothing at all to relieve the picture? Sage. —There is one thing peculiar to the present Kali-Yuga that may be used by the Student. All causes now bring about their effects much more rapidly than in any other or better age. A sincere lover of the race can accomplish more in three incarnations under Kali-Yuga’s reign than he could in a much greater number in any other age. Thus by bearing all the manifold troubles of this Age and steadily triumphing, the object of his efforts will be more quickly realized, for, while the obstacles seem great, the powers to be invoked can be reached more quickly. Student.— Even if this is, spiritually considered, a Dark Age, is it not in part redeemed by the increasing triumphs of mind over matter, and by the effects of science in mitigating human ills, such as the causes of disease, disease itself, cruelty, intolerance, bad laws, etc.? Sage.— Yes, these are mitigations of the darkness in just the same way that a lamp gives some light at night but does not restore daylight. In this age there are great triumphs of science, but they are nearly all directed to effects and do not take away the causes of the evils. Great C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  103 st rides have been made in the arts and in cure of diseases, but in the future, as the flower of our civilization unfolds, new diseases will arise and more strange disorders will be known, springing from causes that lie deep in the minds of men and which can only be eradicated"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"by spiritual living. Student.— Admitting all you say, are not we, as Theosophists, to welcome every discovery of truth in any field, especially such truth as lessens suffering or enlarges the moral sense? Sage.— That is our duty. All truths discovered must be parts of the one Absolute Truth, and so much added to the sum of our outer knowledge. There will always be a large number of men who seek for these parts of truth, and others who try to alleviate present human misery. They each do a great and appointed work that no true Theosophist should ignore. And it is a]so the duty of the latter to make similar efforts when possible, for Theosophy is a dead thing if it is not turned into the life. At the same time, no one of us may be the judge of just how much or how little our brother is doing in that direction. If he does all that he can and knows how to do, he does his whole present duty. Student.— I fear that a hostile attitude by Occult teachers towards the learning and philanthropy of the time may arouse prejudice against Theosophy and Occultism, and needlessly impede the spread of Truth. May it not be so? Sage.— The real Occult Teachers have no hostile attitude towards these things. If some persons, who like theosophy and try to spread it, take such a position, they do not thereby alter the one assumed by the real Teachers who work with all classes of men and use every possible instrument for good. But at the same time we have found that an excess of the technical and special knowledge of the day very often acts to prevent men from apprehending the truth. Student.— Are there any causes, other than the spread of Theosophy, which may operate to reverse the present drift towards materialism? Sage.— The spread of the knowledge of the laws of Karma and Reincarnation and of a belief in the absolute 104  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS sp iritual unity of all beings will alone prevent this drift. The cycle must, however, run its course, and until that is ended all beneficial causes will of necessity act slowly and not to the extent they would in a brighter age. As each student lives a better life and by his example imprints upon the astral light the picture of a higher aspiration acted in the world, he thus aids souls of advanced development to descend from other spheres where the cycles are so dark that they can no longer stay there. Student.— Accept my thanks for your instruction. Sage.— May you reach the terrace of` enlightenment. –––––––––– E LEMENTALS AND E LEMENTARIES Student.— If I understand you, an elemental is a centre of force, without intelligence,"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"without moral character or tendencies, but capable of` being directed in its movements by human thoughts, which may, consciously or not, give it any form, and to a certain extent intelligence; in its simplest form it is visible as a disturbance in a transparent medium, such as would be produced by “a glass fish, so transparent as to be invisible, swimming through the air of the room,” and leaving behind him a shimmer, such as hot air makes when rising from a stove. Also, elementals, attracted and vitalized by certain thoughts, may effect a lodgment in the human system (of which they then share the government with the ego), and are very hard to get out. Sage.— Correct, in general, except as to their “effecting a lodgment.” Some classes of elementals, however, have an intelligence of their own and a character, but they are far beyond our comprehension and ought perhaps to have some other name. That class which has most to do with us answers the above description. They are centres of force or energy which are acted on by us while thinking and in other bodily motions. We also act on them and give them form by a species of thought which we have no register of. As, C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  105 o n e person might shape an elemental so as to seem like an insect, and not be able to tell whether he had thought of such a thing or not. For there is a vast unknown country in each human being which he does not himself understand until he has tried, and then only after many initiations. That “elementals . . . . . . . . . . . . may effect a lodgment in the human system, of which they then share the government, and are very hard to get out” is, as a whole, incorrect. It is only in certain cases that any one or more elementals are attracted to and “find lodgment in the human system.” In such cases special rules apply. We are not considering such cases. The elemental world interpenetrates this, and is therefore eternally present in the human system. As it (the elemental world) is automatic and like a photographic plate, all atoms continually arriving at and departing from the “human system” are constantly assuming the impression conveyed by the acts and thoughts of that person, and therefore, if` he sets up a strong current of thought, he attracts elementals in greater numbers, and they all take on one prevailing tendency or colour, so that all new arrivals find a homogeneous colour or image which they instantly assume. On the other hand, a man who has many diversities of thought and meditation is not homogeneous, but, so to say, parti-coloured, and so the elementals may lodge in that part which is different from the rest and go away in like condition. In the first case it is one mass of elementals similarly vibrating or electrified and coloured, and in that sense may be called one elemental in just the same way that we know one man as Jones, although for years he has been giving off and taking on new atoms of gross matte,. Student.— If they are attracted and repelled by thoughts, do they move with the velocity of thought, say from here to the planet Neptune?"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Sage .—They move with the velocity of thought. In their world there is no space or time as we understand those terms. If Neptune be within the astral sphere of this world, then they go there with that velocity, otherwise not; but that “if” need not be solved now 106  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS St udent.— What determines their movements besides thought,— e.g. when they are floating about the room. Sage.— Those other classes of thoughts above referred to; certain exhalations of beings; different rates and ratios of vibration among beings; different changes of magnetism caused by present causes or by the moon and the year; different polarities; changes of sound; changes of influences from other minds at a distance. Student.— When so floating, can they be seen by anyone, or only by those persons who are clairvoyant? Sage.— Clairvoyance is a poor word. They can be seen by partly clairvoyant people. By all those who can see thus; by more people, perhaps, than are aware of the fact. Student.— Can they be photographed, as the rising air from the hot stove can? Sage.— Not to my knowledge yet. It is not impossible, however. Student.— Are they the lights, seen floating about a dark séance room by clairvoyant people? Sage.— In the majority of cases those lights are produced by them. Student.— Exactly what is their relation to light, that makes it necessary to hold séances in the dark? Sage.— It is not their relation to light that makes darkness necessary, but the fact that light causes constant agitation and alteration in the magnetism of the room. All these things can be done just as well in the light of day. If I should be able to make clear to you “exactly what is their relation to light,” then you would know what has long been kept secret, the key to the elemental world. This is kept guarded because it is a dangerous secret. No matter how virtuous you are, you could not—once you knew the secret—prevent the knowledge getting out into the minds of others who would not hesitate to use it for bad purposes. Student.— I have noticed that attention often interferes with certain phenomena; thus a pencil will not write when watched, but writes at once when covered; or a mental question cannot be answered till the mind has left it and gone to something else. Why is this? C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  107 Sa ge.— This kind of attention creates confusion. In these things we use desire, will, and knowledge. The desire is present, but knowledge is absent. When the desire is well formed"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"and attention withdrawn, the thing is often done; but when our attention is continued we only interrupt, because we possess only half attention. In order to use attention, it must be of that sort which can hold itself to the point of a needle for an indefinite period of time. Student.— I have been told that but few people can go to a séance without danger to themselves, either of some spiritual or astral contamination, or of having their vitality depleted for the benefit of the spooks, who suck the vital force out of the circle through the medium, as if the former were a glass of` lemonade and the latter a straw. How is this? Sage.— Quite generally this happens. It is called Bhut worship by the Hindus. Student.— Why are visitors at a séance often extremely and unaccountably tired next day? Sage.— Among other reasons, because mediums absorb the vitality for the use of the “spooks,” and often vile vampire elementaries are present. Student.— What are some of the dangers at séances? Sage.— The scenes visible—in the Astral—at séances are horrible, inasmuch as these “spirits”—bhuts—precipitate themselves upon sitters and mediums alike; and as there is no séance without having present some or many bad elementaries—half dead human beings,—there is much vampirising going on. These things fall upon the people like a cloud or a big octopus, and disappear within them as if sucked in by a sponge. That is one reason why it is not well to attend them in general. Elementaries are not all bad, but, in a general sense, they are not good. They are shells, no doubt of that. Well, they have much automatic and seemingly intelligent action left if they are those of strongly material people who died attached to the things of life. If of people of an opposite character, they are not so strong. Then there is a class which are really not dead, such as suicides, and 108  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS su dden deaths, and highly wicked people. They are powerful. Elementals enter into all of them, and thus get a fictitious personality and intelligence wholly the property of the shell. They galvanize the shell into action, and by its means can see and hear as if beings themselves, like us. The shells are, in this case, just like a sleep-walking human body. They will through habit exhibit the advancement they got while in the flesh. Some people you know, do not impart to their bodily molecules the habit of their minds to as great [an] extent as others. We thus see why the utterances of these so-called “spirits” are never ahead of the highest point of` progress attained by living human beings, and why they take up the ideas elaborated day-by-day by their votaries. This séance worship is what was called in Old India the worship of the Pretas and Bhuts and Pisachas and Ghandarvas. I do not think any elementary capable of motive had ever any other than a bad one; the rest are nothing, they have no motive and are only the shades refused passage by Charon. Student.— What is the relation between sexual force and phenomena? Sage.— It is at the bottom. This force is vital, creative, and a sort of reservoir. It may be lost by mental action as well as by physical. In fact its finer part is dissipated by mental"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"imaginings, while physical acts only draw off the gross part, that which is the “carrier” (upadhi) for the finer. Student.— Why do so many mediums cheat, even when they can produce real phenomena? Sage.— It is the effect of the use of that which in itself is sublimated cheating, which, acting on an irresponsible mind, causes the lower form of cheat, of which the higher is any illusionary form whatever. Besides, a medium is of necessity unbalanced somewhere. They deal with these forces for pay, and that is enough to call to them all the wickedness of time. They use the really gross sorts of matter, which causes inflammation in corresponding portions of` the moral character, and hence divagations from the path of honesty. It is a great temptation. You do not know, either, what fierceness there is C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  109 in those who “have paid” for a sitting and wish “for the worth of their money.” Student.— When a clairvoyant, as a man did here a year ago, tells me that, “he sees a strong band of spirits about me,” and among them an old man who says he is a certain eminent character, what does he really see? Empty and senseless shells? If` so, what brought them there? Or elementals which have got their form from my mind or his? Sage.— Shells, I think, and thoughts, and old astral pictures. II, for instance, you once saw that eminent person and conceived great respect or fear for him, so that his image was graven in your astral sphere in deeper lines than other images, it would be seen for your whole life by seers, who, if untrained,—as they all are here,—could not tell whether it was an image or reality; and then each sight of it is a revivification of the image. Besides, not all would see the same thing. Fall down, for instance, and hurt your body, and that will bring up all similar events and old forgotten things before any seer’s eye. The whole astral world is a mass of illusion; people see into it, and then, through the novelty of the thing and the exclusiveness of the power, they are bewildered into thinking they actually see true things, whereas they have only removed one thin crust of dirt.

No three-dimensional being can do this; and as you understand “matter,” it is impossible for you to conceive how such a knot can be tied or how a solid ring can be passed through the matter of another solid one. These things can be done by elementals. Student.— Are they not all of one class? Sage.— No. There are different classes for each plane, and division of plane, of nature. Many can never be recognized by men. And those pertaining to our plane do not act in another. You must remember, too, that these “planes” of which we are speaking interpenetrate each other. Student.— Am I to understand that a clairvoyant or clairaudient has to do with or is affected by a certain special class or classes of elementals? Sage.— Yes. A clairvoyant can only see the sights properly belonging to the planes his development reaches to or has opened. And the elementals in those planes show to the clairvoyant only such pictures as belong to their plane. Other parts of the idea or thing pictured may be retained in planes not yet open to the seer. For this reason few clairvoyants know the whole truth. Student. —Is there not some connection between the Karma of man and elementals? Sage.— A very important one. The elemental world has become a strong factor in the Karma of the human race. Being unconscious, automatic, and photographic, it assumes the complexion of the human family itself. In the earlier ages, when we may postulate that man had not yet begun to make bad Karma, the elemental world was more friendly to man because it had not received unfriendly impressions. But so soon as man began to become ignorant, unfriendly to himself and the rest of creation, C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  111 th e elemental world began to take on exactly the same complexion and return to humanity the exact pay, so to speak, due for the actions of humanity. Or, like a donkey, which, when he is pushed against, will push against you. Or, as a human being, when anger or insult is offered, feels inclined to return the same. So the elemental world, being unconscious force, returns or reacts upon humanity exactly as humanity acted towards it, whether the actions of men were done with the knowledge of these laws or not. So in these times it has come to be that the elemental world has the complexion and action which is the exact result of all the actions and thoughts and desires of men from the earliest times. And, being unconscious and only acting according to the natural laws of its being, the elemental world"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"is a powerful factor in the workings of Karma. And so long as mankind does not cultivate brotherly feeling and charity towards the whole of creation, just so long will the elementals be without the impulse to act for our benefit. But so soon and wherever man or men begin to cultivate brotherly feeling and love for the whole of creation, there and then the elementals begin to take on the new condition. Student.— How then about the doing of phenomena by adepts? Sage.— The production of phenomena is not possible without either the aid or disturbance of elementals. Each phenomenon entails the expenditure of great force, and also brings on a correspondingly great disturbance in the elemental world, which disturbance is beyond the limit natural to ordinary human life. It then follows that, as soon as the phenomenon is completed, the disturbance occasioned begins to be compensated for. The elementals are in greatly excited motion, and precipitate themselves in various directions. They are not able to affect those who are protected. But they are able, or rather it is possible for them, to enter into the sphere of unprotected persons, and especially those persons who are engaged in the study of occultism. And then they become agents in concentrating the karma of those persons, producing troubles and disasters often, or other difficulties which otherwise might have 112  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS be en so spread over a period of time as to be not counted more than the ordinary vicissitudes of` life. This will go to explain the meaning of the statement that an Adept will not do a phenomenon unless he sees the desire in the mind of another lower or higher Adept or student; for then there is a sympathetic relation established, and also a tacit acceptance of the consequences which may ensue. It will also help to understand the peculiar reluctance often of some persons, who can perform phenomena, to produce them in cases where we may think their production would be beneficial; and also why they are never done in order to compass worldly ends, as is natural for worldly people to suppose might be done,—such as procuring money, transferring objects, influencing minds, and so on. Student .—Accept my thanks for your instruction. Sage.— May you reach the terrace of enlightenment! –––––––––– Student. —Is there any reason why you do not give me a more detailed explanation of the constitution of elementals and the modes by which they work? Sage.— Yes. There are many reasons. Among others is your inability, shared by most of the people of` the present day, to comprehend a description of things that pertain to a world with which you are not familiar and for which you do not yet possess terms of expression. Were I to put forth these descriptions, the greater part would seem vague and incomprehensible on one hand, while on the other many of them would mislead you"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"because of the interpretation put on them by yourself. Another reason is that, if the constitution, field of action, and method of action of elementals were given out, there are some minds of a very inquiring and peculiar bent who soon could find out how to come into communication with these extraordinary beings, with results disadvantageous to the community as well as the individuals. Student.— Why so? Is it not well to increase the sum of human knowledge, even respecting most recondite parts of nature; or can it be that the elementals are bad? C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  113 Sa ge.— It is wise to increase the knowledge of nature’s laws, but always with proper limitations. All things will become known some day. Nothing can be kept back when men have reached the point where they can understand. But at this time it would not be wise to give them, for the asking, certain knowledge that would not be good for them. That knowledge relates to elementals, and it can for the present be kept back from the scientists of today. So long as it can be retained from them, it will be, until they and their followers are of a different stamp. As to the moral character of elementals, they have none: they are colourless in themselves—except some classes—and merely assume the tint, so to speak, of the person using them. Student.— Will our scientific men one day, then, be able to use these beings, and, if so, what will be the manner of it? Will their use be confined to only the good men of the earth? Sage.— The hour is approaching when all this will be done. But the scientists of to-day are not the men to get this knowledge. They are only pigmy forerunners who sow seed and delve blindly in no thoroughfares. They are too small to be able to grasp these mighty powers, but they are not wise enough to see that their methods will eventually lead to Black Magic in centuries to come when they shall be forgotten. When elemental forces are used similarly as we now see electricity and other natural energies adapted to various purposes, there will be “war in heaven.” Good men will not alone possess the ability to use them. Indeed, the sort of man you now call “good” will not be the most able. The wicked will, however, pay liberally for the power of those who can wield such forces, and at last the Supreme Masters, who now guard this knowledge from children, will have to come forth. Then will ensue a dreadful war, in which, as has ever happened, the Masters will succeed and the evil doers be destroyed by the very engines, principalities, and powers prostituted to their own purposes during years of intense selfish living. But why dilate on this; in these days it is only a prophecy. 114  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" Student.— Could you give me some hints as to how the secrets of the elemental plane are preserved and prevented from being known? Do these guardians of whom you speak occupy themselves in checking elementals, or how? Do they see much danger of divulgement likely in those instances where elemental action is patent to the observer? Sage .—As to whether they check elementals or not need not be inquired into, because, while that may be probable, it does not appear very necessary where men are unsuspicious of the agency causing the phenomena. It is much easier to throw a cloud over the investigator’s mind and lead him off to other results of often material advantage to himself and men, while at the same time acting as a complete preventive or switch which turns his energies and application into different departments. It might be illustrated thus: Suppose that a number of trained occultists are set apart to watch the various sections of the world where the mental energies are in fervid operation. It is quite easy for them to see in a moment any mind that is about reaching a clue into the elemental world; and, besides, imagine that trained elementals themselves constantly carry information of such events. Then, by superior knowledge and command over this peculiar world, influences presenting various pictures are sent out to that inquiring mind. In one case it may be a new moral reform, in another a great invention is revealed, and such is the effect that the man’s whole time and mind are taken up by this new thing which he fondly imagines is his own. Or, again, it would be easy to turn his thoughts into a certain rut leading far from the dangerous clue. In fact, the methods are endless. Student.— Would it be wise to put into the hands of truly good, conscientious men who now use aright what gifts they have, knowledge of and control over elementals, to be used on the side of right? Sage.— The Masters are the judges of what good men are to have this power and control. You must not forget that you cannot be sure of the character at bottom of those whom you call “truly good and conscientious men.” Place them in the fire of the tremendous C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  115 te mptation which such power and control would furnish, and most of them would fail. But the Masters already know the characters of all who in any way approach to a knowledge of these forces, and They always judge whether such a man is to be aided or prevented. They are not working to make these laws and forces known, but to establish right doctrine, speech, and action, so that the characters and motives of men shall undergo such radical changes as to fit them for wielding power in the elemental world. And that power is not now lying idle, as you infer, but is being always used by those who will never fail to rightly use it. Student.— Is there any illustration at hand showing what the people of the present day would do with these extraordinary energies? Sage.— A cursory glance at men in these western worlds engaged in the mad rush after"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"money, many of them willing to do anything to get it, and at the strain, almost to warfare, existing between labourers and users of labour, must show you that, were either class in possession of power over the elemental world, they would direct it to the furtherance of the aims now before them. Then look at Spiritualism. It is recorded in the Lodge—photographed, you may say, by the doers of the acts themselves—that an enormous number of persons daily seek the aid of mediums and their “spooks” merely on questions of business. Whether to buy stocks, or engage in mining for gold and silver, to deal in lotteries, or to make new mercantile contracts. Here on one side is a picture of a coterie of men who obtained at a low figure some mining property on the advice of elemental spirits with fictitious names masquerading behind mediums; these mines were then to be put upon the public at a high profit, inasmuch as the “spirits” promised metal. Unhappily for the investors, it failed. But such a record is repeated in many cases. Then here is another where in a great American city— the Karma being favourable—a certain man speculated in stocks upon similar advice, succeeded, and, after giving the medium liberal pay, retired to what is called 116  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS e n joyment of life. Neither party devoted either himself or the money to the benefiting of humanity. There is no question of honour involved, nor any as to whether money ought or ought not to be made. It is solely one as to the propriety, expediency, and results of giving suddenly into the hands of a community unprepared and without an altruistic aim, such abnormal power. Take hidden treasure, for instance. There is much of it in hidden places, and many men wish to get it. For what purpose? For the sake of ministering to their luxurious wants and leaving it to their equally unworthy descendants. Could they know the mantram controlling the elementals that guard such treasure, they would use it at once, motive or no motive, the sole object being the money in the case. Student.— Do some sorts of elementals have guard over hidden treasure? Sage.— Yes, in every instance, whether never found or soon discovered. The causes for the hiding and the thoughts of the hider or loser have much to do with the permanent concealment or subsequent finding. Student.— What happens when a large sum of money, say, such as Captain Kidd’s mythical treasure, is concealed, or when a quantity of coin is lost? Sage.— Elementals gather about it. They have many and curious modes of causing further concealment. They even influence animals to that end. This class of elementals seldom, if ever, report at your spiritualistic séances. As time goes on the forces of air and water still further aid them, and sometimes they are able even to prevent the hider from recovering it. Thus in course of years, even when they may have altogether lost their hold on it, the whole thing becomes shrouded in mist, and it is impossible to find anything. Student.— This in part explains why so many failures are recorded in the search for hidden treasure. But how about the Masters; are they prevented thus by these weird"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"guardians? Sage.— They are not. The vast quantities of gold hidden in the earth and under the sea are at their disposal C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  117 al ways. They can, when necessary for their purposes, obtain such sums of money on whom no living being or descendants of any have the slightest claim, as would appal the senses of your greatest money getter. They have but to command the very elementals controlling it, and They have it. This is the basis for the story of Aladdin’s wonderful lamp, more true than you believe. Student.— Of what use then is it to try, like the alchemists, to make gold? With the immense amount of buried treasure thus easily found when you control its guardian, it would seem a waste of time and money to learn transmutation of metals. Sage.— The transmutation spoken of by the real alchemists was the alteration of the base alloy in man’s nature. At the same time, actual transmutation of lead into gold is possible. And many followers of the alchemists, as well as of the pure-souled Jacob Boehme, eagerly sought to accomplish the material transmuting, being led away by the glitter of wealth. But an Adept has no need for transmutation, as I have shown you. The stories told of various men who are said to have produced gold from base metals for different kings in Europe are wrong explanations. Here and there Adepts have appeared, assuming different names, and in certain emergencies they supplied or used large sums of money. But instead of its being the product of alchemical art, it was simply ancient treasure brought to them by elementals in their service and that of the Lodge. Raymond Lully or Robert Flood might have been of that sort, but I forbear to say, since I cannot claim acquaintance with those men. Student .—I thank you for your instruction. Sage.— May you reach the terrace of enlightenment! –––––––––– M ANTRAMS Student. —You s poke of mantrams by which we could control elementals on guard over hidden treasure. What is a mantram? 118  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Sage.— A mantram is a collection of words which, when sounded in speech, induce"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"certain vibrations not only in the air, but also in the finer ether, thereby producing certain effects. Student.— Are the words taken at haphazard? Sage.— Only by those who, knowing nothing of mantrams, yet use them. Student.— May they, then, be used according to rule and also irregularly? Can it be possible that people who know absolutely nothing of their existence or field of operations should at the same time make use of them? Or is it something like digestion, of which so many people know nothing whatever, while they in fact are dependent upon its proper use for their existence? I crave your indulgence because I know nothing of the subject. Sage.— The “common people” in almost every country make use of them continually, but even in that case the principle at the bottom is the same as in the other. In a new country where folklore has not yet had time to spring up, the people do not have as many as in such a land as India or in long settled parts of Europe. The aborigines, however, in any country will be possessed of them. Student .—You do not now infer that they are used by Europeans for the controlling of elementals. Sage.— No. I refer to their effect in ordinary intercourse between human beings. And yet there are many men in Europe, as well as in Asia, who can thus control animals, but those are nearly always special cases. There are men in Germany, Austria, Italy, and Ireland who can bring about extraordinary effects on horses, cattle, and the like, by peculiar sounds uttered in a certain way. In those instances the sound used is a mantram of only one member, and will act only on the particular animal that the user knows it can rule. Student.— Do these men know the rules governing the matter? Are they able to convey it to another? Sage.— Generally not. It is a gift self-found or inherited, and they only know that it can be done by them, just as a mesmeriser knows he can do a certain thing with a wave of his hand, but is totally ignorant of the principle. They C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  119 ar e as ignorant of the base of this strange effect as your modern physiologists are of the function and cause of such a common thing as yawning. Student.— Under what head should we put this unconscious exercise of power? Sage.— Under the head of natural magic, that materialistic science can never crush out. It is a touch with nature and her laws always preserved by the masses, who, while they form the majority of the population, are yet ignored by the “cultured classes.” And so it will be discovered by you that it is not in London or Paris or New York drawing-rooms that you will find mantrams, whether regular or irregular, used by the people. “Society,” too cultured to be natural, has adopted methods of speech intended to conceal and to deceive, so that natural mantrams cannot be studied within its borders. Single, natural mantrams are such words as “wife.” When it is spoken it brings up in the mind all that is implied by the word. And if in another language, the word would be"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"that corresponding to the same basic idea. And so with expressions of greater length, such as many slang sentences; thus, “I want to see the colour of his money.” There are also sentences applicable to certain individuals, the use of which involves a knowledge of the character of those to whom we speak. When these are used, a peculiar and lasting vibration is set up in the mind of the person affected, leading to a realization in action of the idea involved, or to a total change of life due to the appositeness of the subjects brought up and to the peculiar mental antithesis induced in the hearer. As soon as the effect begins to appear the mantram may be forgotten, since the law of habit then has sway in the brain. Again, bodies of men are acted on by expressions having the mantramic quality; this is observed in great social or other disturbances. The reason is the same as before. A dominant idea is aroused that touches upon a want of the people or on an abuse which oppresses them, and the change and interchange in their brains between the idea 120  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS a n d the form of words go on until the result is accomplished. To the occultist of powerful sight this is seen to be a “ringing” of the words coupled with the whole chain of feelings, interests, aspirations, and so forth, that grows faster and deeper as the time for the relief or change draws near. And the greater number of persons affected by the idea involved, the larger, deeper, and wider the result. A mild illustration may be found in Lord Beaconsfield of England. He knew about mantrams, and continually invented phrases of that quality. “Peace with honour” was one; “a scientific frontier” was another; and his last, intended to have a wider reach, but which death prevented his supplementing, was “Empress of India.” King Henry of England also tried it without himself knowing why, when he added to his titles, “Defender of the Faith.” With these hints numerous illustrations will occur to you. Student.— These mantrams have only to do with human beings as between each other. They do not affect elementals, as I judge from what you say. And they are not dependent upon the sound so much as upon words bringing up ideas. Am I right in this; and is it the case that there is a field in which certain vocalizations produce effects in the Akasa by means of which men, animals, and elementals alike can be influenced, without regard to their knowledge of any known language? Sage .—You are right. We have only spoken of natural, unconsciously-used mantrams. The scientific mantrams belong to the class you last referred to. It is to be doubted whether they can be found in modern Western languages,—especially among English speaking people who are continually changing and adding to their spoken words to such an extent that the English of to-day could hardly be understood by Chaucer’s predecessors. It is in the ancient Sanskrit and the language which preceded it that mantrams are hidden. The laws governing their use are also to be found in those languages, and not in any modern philological store. Student.— Suppose, though, that one acquires a knowledge of ancient and correct mantrams, could he affect a"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  121 pe rson speaking English, and by the use of English words? Sage.— He could; and all adepts have the power to translate a strictly regular mantram into any form of language, so that a single sentence thus uttered by them will have an immense effect on the person addressed, whether it be by letter or word of mouth. Student .—Is there no way in which we might, as it were imitate those adepts in this? Sage.— Yes, you should study simple forms of mantramic quality, for the purpose of thus reaching the hidden mind of all the people who need spiritual help. You will find now and then some expression that has resounded in the brain, at last producing such a result that he who heard it turns his mind to spiritual things. Student.— I thank you for your instruction. Sage.— May the Brahmamantram guide you to the everlasting truth.—O M . –– –––––––– Student .—A materialist stated to me as his opinion that all that is said about mantrams is mere sentimental theorizing, and while it may be true that certain words affect people, the sole reason is that they embody ideas distasteful or pleasant to the hearers, but that the mere sounds, as such, have no effect whatever, and as to either words or sounds affecting animals he denied it altogether. Of course he would not take elementals into account at all, as their existence is impossible for him. Sage.— This position is quite natural in these days. There has been so much materialization of thought, and the real scientific attitude of leading minds in different branches of investigation has been so greatly misunderstood by those who think they follow the example of the scientific men, that most people in the West are afraid to admit anything beyond what may be apprehended by the five senses. The man you speak of is one of that always numerous class who adopt as fixed and unalterable general laws laid down from time to time by well-known savants, 122  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS fo rgetting that the latter constantly change and advance from point to point. Student.— Do you think, then, that the scientific world will one day admit much that is known to Occultists? Sage.— Yes, it will. The genuine Scientist is always in that attitude which permits him to admit things proven. He may seem to you often to be obstinate and blind, but in fact he is proceeding slowly to the truth,—too slowly, perhaps, for you, yet not in the position of knowing all. It is the veneered scientist who swears by the published results of the work of leading men as being the last word, while, at the very moment he is doing so, his authority"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"may have made notes or prepared new theories tending to greatly broaden and advance the last utterance. It is only when the dogmatism of a priest backed up by law declares that a discovery is opposed to the revealed word of his god, that we may fear. That day is gone for a long time to come, and we need expect no more scenes like that in which Galileo took part. But among the materialistic minds to whom you referred, there is a good deal of that old spirit left, only that the “revealed word of God “ has become the utterances of our scientific leaders. Student.— I have observed that within even the last quarter of a century. About ten years ago many well-known men laughed to scorn any one who admitted the facts within the experience of every mesmeriser, while now, under the term “hypnotism,” they are nearly all admitted. And when these lights of our time were denying it all, the French doctors were collating the results of a long series of experiments. It seems as if the invention of a new term for an old and much abused one furnished an excuse for granting all that had been previously denied. But have you anything to say about those materialistic investigators? Are they not governed by some powerful, though unperceived, law? Sage.— They are. They are in the forefront of the mental, but not of the spiritual, progress of the time, and are driven forward by forces they know nothing of. Help is very often given to them by the Masters, who, neglecting C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  123 no thing, constantly see to it that these men make progress upon the fittest lines for them, just as you are assisted not only in your spiritual life but in your mental also. These men, therefore, will go on admitting facts and finding new laws or new names for old laws, to explain them. They cannot help it. Student.— What should be our duty, then, as students of truth? Should we go out as reformers of science, or what? Sage. —You ought not to take up the role of reformers of the schools and their masters, because success would not attend the effort. Science is competent to take care of itself, and you would only be throwing pearls before them to be trampled under foot. Rest content that all within their comprehension will be discovered and admitted from time to time. The endeavour to force them into admitting what you believe to be so plain would be due almost solely to your vanity and love of praise. It is not possible to force them, any more than it is for me to force you, to admit certain incomprehensible laws, and you would not think me wise or fair to first open before you things, to understand which you have not the necessary development, and then to force you into admitting their truth. Or if, out of reverence, you should say “These things are true,” while you comprehended nothing and were not progressing, you would have bowed to superior force. Student.— But you do not mean that we should remain ignorant of science and devote ourselves only to ethics? Sage.— Not at all. Know all that you can. Become conversant with and sift all that the schools have declared, and as much more on your own account as is possible, but at the"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"same time teach, preach, and practice a life based on a true understanding of brotherhood. This is the true way. The common people, those who know no science, are the greatest number. They must be so taught that the discoveries of science which are unillumined by spirit may not be turned into Black Magic. Student.— In our last conversation you touched upon the guarding of buried treasure by elementals. I should like 124  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS ve ry much to hear a little more about that. Not about how to control them or to procure the treasure, but upon the subject generally. Sage.— The laws governing the hiding of buried treasure are the same as those that relate to lost objects. Every person has about him a fluid, or plane, or sphere, or energy, whichever you please to call it, in which are constantly found elementals that partake of his nature. That is, they are tinted with his colour and impressed by his character. There are numerous classes of these. Some men have many of one class or of all, or many of some and few of others. And anything worn upon your person is connected with your elementals. For instance, you wear cloth made of wool or linen, and little objects made of wood, bone, brass, gold, silver, and other substances. Each one of these has certain magnetic relations peculiar to itself, and all of them are soaked, to a greater or less extent, with your magnetism as well as nervous fluid. Some of them, because of their substance, do not long retain this fluid, while others do. The elementals are connected, each class according to its substance, with those objects by means of the magnetic fluid. And they are acted upon by the mind and desires to a greater extent than you know, and in a way that cannot be formulated in English. Your desires have a powerful grasp, so to say, upon certain things, and upon others a weaker hold. When one of these objects is suddenly dropped, it is invariably followed by elementals. They are drawn after it, and may be said to go with the object by attraction rather than by sight. In many cases they completely envelop the thing, so that, although it is near at hand, it cannot be seen by the eye. But after a while the magnetism wears off and their power to envelop the article weakens, whereupon it appears in sight. This does not happen in every case. But it is a daily occurrence, and is sufficiently obvious to many persons to be quite removed from the realm of fable. I think, indeed, that one of your literary persons has written an essay upon this very experience, in which, although treated in a comic vein, many truths are unconsciously told; the title of this C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  125 wa s, if I mistake not, “Upon the Innate Perversity of Inanimate Objects.” There is such a nice balancing of forces in these cases that you must be careful in your generalizations."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"You may justly ask, for instance, why, when a coat is dropped, it seldom disappears from sight? Well, there are cases in which even such a large object is hidden, but they are not very common. The coat is full of your magnetism, and the elementals may feel in it just as much of` you as when it is on your back. There may be, for them, no disturbance of the relations, magnetic and otherwise. And often in the case of a small object not invisible, the balancing of forces, due to many causes that have to do with your condition at the time prevents the hiding. To decide in any particular case, one would have to see into the realm where the operation of these laws is hidden, and calculate all the forces, so as to say why it happened in one way and not in another. Student.— But take the case of` a man who, being in possession of treasure, hides it in the earth and goes away and dies, and it is not found. In that instance the elementals did not hide it. Or when a miser buries his gold or jewels. How about those? Sage .—In all cases where a man buries gold, or jewels, or money, or precious things, his desires are fastened to that which he hides. Many of his elementals attach themselves to it, and other classes of them also, who had nothing to do with him, gather round and keep it hidden. In the case of the captain of a ship containing treasure the influences are very powerful, because there the elementals are gathered from all the persons connected with the treasure, and the officer himself is full of solicitude for what is committed to his charge. You should also remember that gold and silver—or metals—have relations with elementals that are of a strong and peculiar character. They do not work for human law, and natural law does not assign any property in metals to man, nor recognize in him any peculiar and transcendent right to retain what he has dug from the earth or acquired to himself. Hence we do not find the elementals anxious to restore to him the gold or silver which he had lost. If 126  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS we were to assume that they occupied themselves in catering to the desires of men or in establishing what we call our rights over property, we might as well at once grant the existence of a capricious and irresponsible Providence. They proceed solely according to the law of their being, and, as they are without the power of making a judgment, they commit no blunders and are not to be moved by considerations based upon our vested rights or our unsatisfied wishes. Therefore, the spirits that appertain to metals invariably act as the laws of their nature prescribe, and one way of doing so is to obscure the metals from our sight. Student.— Can you make any application of all this in the realm of ethics? Sage.— There is a very important thing you should not overlook. Every time you harshly and unmercifully criticise the faults of another, you produce an attraction to yourself of certain quantities of elementals from that person. They fasten themselves upon you and endeavour to find in you a similar state or spot or fault that they have left in the other person. It is as if they left him to serve you at higher wages, so to say. Then there is that which I referred to in a preceding conversation, about the effect of"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"our acts and thoughts upon, not only the portion of the astral light belonging to each of us with its elementals but upon the whole astral world. If men saw the dreadful pictures imprinted there and constantly throwing down upon us their suggestions to repeat the same acts or thoughts, a millennium might soon draw near. The astral light is, in this sense, the same as the photographer’s negative plate, and we are the sensitive paper underneath, on which is being printed the picture. We can see two sorts of pictures for each act. One is the act itself, and the other is the picture of the thoughts and feelings animating those engaged in it. You can therefore see that you may be responsible for many more dreadful pictures than you had supposed.

C ONVERSATIONS ON O CCULTISM  127 St udent.— Have these pictures in the astral light anything to do with us upon being reincarnated in subsequent earth-lives? Sage.— They have very much indeed. We are influenced by them for vast periods of time, and in this you can perhaps find clues to many operations of active Karmic law for which you seek. Student.— Is there not also some effect upon animals, and through them upon us, and vice versa? Sage.— Yes. The animal kingdom is affected by us through the astral light. We have impressed the latter with pictures of cruelty, oppression, dominion, and slaughter. The whole Christian world admits that man can indiscriminately slaughter animals, upon the theory, elaborately set forth by priests in early times, that animals have no souls. Even little children learn this, and very early begin to kill insects, birds, and animals, not for protection, but from wantonness. As they grow up the habit is continued, and in England we see that shooting large numbers of birds beyond the wants of the table, is a national peculiarity, or, as I should say, a vice. This may be called a mild illustration. If these people could catch elementals as easily as they can animals, they would kill them for amusement when they did not want them for use; and, if the elementals refused to obey, then their death would follow as a punishment. All this is perceived by the elemental world, without conscience of course; but under the laws of action and reaction, we receive back from it exactly that which we give. Student.— Before we leave the subject I should like to refer again to the question of metals and the relation of man to the elementals connected with the mineral world. We see some persons who seem always to be able to find metals with ease—or, as they say, who are lucky in that direction. How am I to reconcile this with the natural tendency of elementals to hide? Is it because there is a war or discord, as it were, between different classes belonging to any one person? Sage.— That is a part of the explanation. Some persons, as I said, have more of one class attached to them"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"128  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS th a n another. A person fortunate with metals, say of gold and silver, has about him more of the elementals connected with or belonging to the kingdoms of those metals than other people, and thus there is less strife between the elementals. The preponderance of the metal-spirits makes the person more homogeneous with their kingdoms, and a natural attraction exists between the gold or silver lost or buried and that person, more than in the case of other people. Student.— What determines this? Is it due to a desiring of gold and silver, or is it congenital? Sage.— It is innate. The combinations in any one individual are so intricate and due to so many causes that you could not calculate them. They run back many generations, and depend upon peculiarities of soil, climate, nation, family, and race. These are, as you can see, enormously varied, and, with the materials at your command now, quite beyond your reach. Merely wishing for gold and silver will not do it. Student.— I judge also that attempting to get at those elementals by thinking strongly will not accomplish that result either. Sage.— No, it will not, because your thoughts do not reach them. They do not hear or see you, and, as it is only by accidental concentration of forces that unlearned people influence them, these accidents are only possible to the extent that you possess the natural leaning to the particular kingdom whose elementals you have influenced.

[ Lucifer, V ol. II, No. 8, April, 1888, pp. 85-91] The race of mankind would perish, did they cease to aid each other. From the time that the mother binds the child’s head, till the moment that some kind assistant wipes the death-damp from the brow of the dying, we cannot exist without mutual help. All, therefore, that need aid, have a right to ask it from their fellow-mortals. No one who holds the power of granting, can refuse it without guilt. —S IR W ALTER S COTT . Several correspondents and enquirers have lately asked us “What good have you done in India?” To answer it would be easy. One has but to ask the doubters to read the January Number, 1888, of` the Madras Theosophist— our official organ—and, turning to the report in it on the Anniversary Meeting of the Theosophical Society, whose delegates meet yearly at Adyar, see for himself. Many and various are the good works done by the 127 active branches of the Theosophical Society scattered throughout the length and breadth of India. But as most of those works are of a moral and reformatory character, the ethical results upon the members are difficult to describe. Free Sanskrit schools have been opened wherever it was possible; gratuitous classes are held; free dispensaries—homeopathic and allopathic—established for the poor, and many of our Theosophists feed and clothe the needy. All this, however, might have been done by people without belonging to our Brotherhood, we may be told. True; and much the same has been done before the T.S. appeared in India, and from time immemorial. Yet such work has been hitherto done, and such help given by the wealthier members of one caste or religious community exclusively to the poorer members of the same caste and religious denomination. No Brahmin would have held brotherly intercourse even with a Brahmin of another division of his own high caste, let alone with a Jain or Buddhist. A Parsee would only protect and defend his own brother-follower of Zoroaster. A Jain would feed 130  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS an d take care of a lame and sick animal, but would turn away from a Hindu of the Vaishnava or any other sect. He would spend thousands on the “Hospital for Animals”"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"where bullocks, old crippled tigers and dogs are nursed, but would not approach a fellow-man in need unless he was a Jain like himself. But now, since the advent of the Theosophical Society, things in India are, slowly it is true, yet gradually, becoming otherwise. We have, then, to show rather the good moral effect produced by the Society in general, and each branch of it in its own district on the population, than to boast of works of charity, for which India has ever been noted. We shall not enter even into a disquisition upon the benefits to be reaped by the establishment of a Sanskrit, or rather an Oriental and European library at Adyar, which, thanks to the indefatigable efforts of the President-Founder and his colleagues, begins now to assume quite hopeful proportions. But we will draw at once the attention of the enquirers to the ethical aspect of the question; for all the visible or objective works, whether of charity or any other kind, must pale before the results achieved through the influence of the chief universal, ethical aim and idea of our Society. Yes; the seeds of a true Universal Brotherhood of man, not of brother-religionists or sectarians only, have been finally sown on the sacred soil of India! The letter that follows these lines proves it most undeniably. These seeds have been thrown since 1881 into that soil, which, for thousands of years, has stubbornly and systematically ejected everything foreign to its system of caste, and refused to assimilate any heterogeneous element alien to Brahmanism, the chief master of the soil of Aryavarta, or to accept any ideas not based upon the Laws of Manu. The Orientalist and the Anglo-Indian, who know something of that tyranny of caste which has hitherto formed an impassable barrier, an almost fathomless gulf between Brahmanism and every other religion, know also of the great hatred of the orthodox “twice born,” the dwija Brahmin, to the Buddhist nastika (the atheist, he who refuses to recognise the Brahminical gods and idols); and W HAT G OOD H AS T HEOSOPHY D ONE IN I NDIA ?  131 th ey, above all others, will realize, even if they do not fully appreciate, the importance of what has now been achieved by the Theosophical Society. It took several years of incessant efforts to bring about even the beginning of a rapprochement between the Brahmin and Buddhist theosophists. A few years ago the President-Founder of the Society, Colonel H. S. Olcott, had almost succeeded in making a breach in the Chinese wall of Brahmanism. It was an unprecedented event; and it created a great stir among the natives, a sincere enthusiasm among the “Heathen,” and much malicious opposition, gossip, and slanderous denial from those who, above all men, ought to work for the idea of Universal Brotherhood preached by their Master—the good Christian Missionaries. Colonel Olcott had succeeded in arranging a kind of preliminary reconciliation between the Brahminical Theosophical Society of Tinnevelly and their brother Theosophists and neighbours of Ceylon. Several Buddhists had been brought from Lanka, led by the President, carrying with them, as an emblem of peace and reconciliation, a sprout of the sacred râja (king) cocoanut-tree. This actually was to be planted in one of the courts of the Tinnevelly pagoda, as a living and"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"growing witness to the event. It was an extraordinary and imposing sight that day, namely October 25th, 1881, when, before an immense crowd numbering several thousands of Hindus and other natives, the Delegates of the Buddhist Theosophical Societies of Ceylon, met with their brother Theosophists of the Tinnevelly Branch and their Brahmin priests of the pagoda. For over 2,000 years an irreconcilable religious feud had raged between the two creeds and their respective followers. And now they were brought once more together on Hindu soil, and even within the thrice sacred, and to all strangers almost impenetrable, precincts of a Hindu temple, which would have been, only a few days previous to the occurrence, regarded as irretrievably desecrated had even the very shadow of a Buddhist nastika fallen upon its outward walls. Signs of the times, indeed! The cocoanut sprout was planted with great ceremony, and to the sounds of the music of the pagoda orchestra. After 132  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS th at, year after year, Hindus and Buddhists met together at Adyar, at the Annual Conventions for the Anniversary Meetings of the Theosophical Parent Society; but no Brahmin Theosophist had hitherto returned the visit to Ceylon to his Buddhist Brethren. The ice of the centuries had been split, but not sufficiently broken to permit anyone to dive deep enough under it to call this an entire and full reconciliation. But the impressive and long-expected and wished-for event has at last taken place All honour and glory to the son of Brahmins—the proudest; perhaps, of all India, the Northern Brahmins of Kashmir—who was the first to place the sacred duties of Universal Brotherhood above the prejudices, as potent as they are narrow, of caste and custom. We publish below extracts from his own address, which appeared in Sarasavisandaresa, the Singhalese organ of the Buddhists of Ceylon, and let the eloquent narrative speak for itself. But after reading the extracts let not our critics rise once more against the policy of the Theosophical Society, and take the opportunity of calling it intolerant and uncharitable only as regards one creed, namely Christianity because facts will be found in this Address which speak loudly against its vicious system. No Theosophist has ever spoken against the teachings of Christ, no more than he did against those of Krishna, Buddha, or Sankaracharya; and willingly would he treat every Christian as a Brother, if the Christian himself would not persistently turn his back on the Theosophist. But a man would lose every right to the appellation of a member of the Universal Brotherhood, were he to keep silent in the face of the crying bigotry and falseness of all the theological, or rather sacerdotal, systems—the world over. We, Europeans, expatiate loudly and cry against Brahminical tyranny, against caste, against infant and widow marriage, and call every religious dogmatic rule (save our own) idiotic, pernicious, and devilish, and do it orally as in print.

Christians have to choose—either they “shall not judge that they be not judged,” or if they do—and one has but to read the missionary and clerical organs to see how cruel, unchristian, and uncharitable their judgments are—they must be prepared to be judged in their turn. These are portions of an address delivered at the Theosophical Hall, Colombo, on January 29th, 1888, by Pundit Gopi Nath, of Lahore.* [In the address referred to, Pundit Nath, a Kashmiri Brahmin, expresses his deep gratitude to the T. S. for the courage and impetus it gave him to over-leap the barriers of caste and custom in coming to the Buddhists of Ceylon. He pleads brotherhood between the two related religions of Buddhism and Brahminism, while urging them to respect their own religions and not to succumb to missionary attack upon the T.S. and its founders. “It is the rule of the T.S. that its members, whatever their creed may be, shall treat the religions of other members with deference; and its principle is that all religions have some truth underlying them. . . . But between Brahminism and Buddhism we may have something much greater than mere toleration—we must have the deepest mutual esteem and reverence, for all learned people know that there is but little difference between our philosophies.” Why then, is there so much bitter opposition between them, he asks? He attributes these quarrels and riots to the most ignorant and uneducated sources, people who do not appreciate the “bonds of mutual esteem.” Further the pundit urges the Ceylonese Buddhists boldly to respect their own ancestral faith rather than adopt Christian names and customs, merely in hope of becoming respected by Europeans. This, he adds, is never the real outcome anyway. He cites several examples of a caste system, an extravagance and narrow-mindedness of a far worse nature among these very criticizers of their culture. Special warning is given to the people not to entrust their women and children into the hands of missionaries. These foreigners do not come here and spend money for our benefit; no—they have one, and only one, great object always in view, and that is to make proselytes.

This “hope” is based on knowledge, on the secret esoteric doctrines preached by Gautama Buddha, and flashes of which are still found even in the semi-exoteric tenets of the schools of Mahayana, Aryasangha and others.

Courtney, on the general subject of Hylo-Idealism:] [is there aught beyond consciousness?] Most decidedly not. “There is naught beyond co nsciousness ,” a Vedantin and a Theosophist would say, because Absolute Consciousness is infinite and limitless, and there is nothing that can be said to be “beyond” that which is A LL , the self-container, containing all. But the Hylo-Idealists deny the Vedantic idea of no n-separateness, they deny that we are but parts of the whole; deny, in common parlance, “God,” Soul and Spirit, and yet they will talk of “apprehension” and intuition—the function and attribute of man’s immortal Ego, and make of it a function of matter. Thus they vitiate every one of their arguments. C OMMENT ON “U LTIMATE P HILOSOPHY ”  139 [l et “I am” = consciousness—or “sensation” or any other word . . . so that it includes all thought . . . . all connected with the ego in itself] In this paragraph we find the old crux of philosophy—the question as to whether there is any “external reality” in nature—cropping up again. The solution offered is a pure assumption, reached by ignoring one of the fundamental facts of human consciousness, the feeling that the cause of sensation, etc., lies outside the limited, human self. Mr. Courtney, we believe, aims at expressing a conception identical with that of the Adwaita Vedantins of India. But his language is inaccurate and misleading to those who understand his words in their usual sense, e.g., when he speaks of the “I am” outside of which nothing can exist, he is stating a purely Vedantin tenet; but then the “I” in question is not the “I” which acts, feels or thinks, but that absolute consciousness which is no consciousness. It is this confusion between the various ideas represented by “I” which lies at the root of the difficulty—the only philosophical explanation of which rests in the esoteric Vedantin doctrine of “Maya,” or Illusion. [How can I be self and yet not self at the same time?] Very easily. You have only to postulate that self is one, eternal and infinite, the only R EALITY ; and your little self a t r ansient illusion, a reflected ray of the S ELF , therefore a not -S elf. If the Vedantin idea is “meaningless” to the writer, his theory is still more so—to us. [Beyond consciousness all is (to me) a blank, and all that enters consciousness"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"becomes part of myself thereby] This phrase is an admirable illustration in proof of the remarks made in the last foot-note. “Things enter consciousness,” says Mr. Courtney, and it is no word-splitting to point out to him, that not only is it impossible for him to speak without these words or others equivalent to them, but further that he cannot think at all except in terms of these conceptions. It follows that, since he is not talking nonsense, he is trying to express in terms of the mind, what properly transcends mind—in other words we are brought back to the ancient doctrine of “Maya” again. 140  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Da ily experience shows him that things do enter consciousness and, in some sense, become part of himself—but where and what were they, before entering his consciousness? Let him study the doctrine of limitation and “reflected” centres of consciousness, and he will understand himself more clearly. [upon the fact of its own existence the ego cannot reason] A Mystic would take exception to this statement, at least if the word “reason” is used by Mr. Courtney in the sense of “know”:—for his great achievement is “Self”-knowledge, meaning not only the analytical knowledge of his own limited personality, but the synthetical knowledge of “ ONE ” EGO from which that passing personality sprang. [O , light divine, thy reproduction is impossible] How are we to understand “light divine ” in the thought of a Hylo-Idealist, who limits the whole universe to the phantasms of the grey matter of the brain—that matter and its productions being alike illusions? In our humble opinion this philosophy is twin sister to the cosmogony of the orthodox Brahmins, who teach that the world is supported by an elephant, which stands upon a tortoise, the tortoise wagging its tail in absolute Void. We beg our friends, the Hylo-Idealists’, pardon; but, so long as such evident contradictions are not more satisfactorily explained, we can hardly take them seriously, or give them henceforth so much space.

We heartily wish Miss Naden success; but we feel as sure she will return not a whit wiser in Occultism than when she went. We lived in India for "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"C OMMENT ON “U LTIMATE P HILOSOPHY ”  141 ma ny years, and have never yet met with a “Sanskrit Pundit”—officially recognised as such—who knew anything of Occultism. We met with several occultists in India who will not speak; and with but one who is a really learned Occultist (the most learned, perhaps, of all in India), who condescends occasionally to open his mouth and teach. This he never does, however, outside a very small group of Theosophists. Nor do we feel like concealing the sad fact, that a letter from Mr. Max Müller, asking the pundits to divulge occult matter to an English traveller, would rather produce the opposite effect to the one anticipated. The Oxford Professor is very much beloved by the orthodox Hindus, innocent of all knowledge of their esoteric philosophy. Those who are Occultists, however, feel less enthusiastic, for the sins of omission and commission by the great Anglo-German Sanskritist are many. His ridiculous dwarfing of the Hindu chronology, to pander to the Mosaic, probably, and his denying to the Ancient Aryas any knowledge of even Astronomy except through Greek channels—are not calculated to make of him a new Rishi in the eyes of Aryanophils. If learning about Occultism is Miss Naden’s chief object in going to India, then, it is to be feared, she has started on a wild-goose’s chase. Hindus and Brahmins are not such fools as we Europeans are, on the subject of the sacred sciences, and they will hardly desecrate that which is holy, by giving it unnecessary publicity.

The 200 millions of proselytes to the Mussulman faith as against one million of converts of Christianity in this century alone, a fact complained of at the Church Conference by Dr. Taylor, hardly a few weeks ago, would rather clash with this statement. * The Rev.

Nor does the very conservative Standard, when complaining that England is no longer a Christian nation and that a very large percentage of its population no longer accepts the religion embodied in the Bible, bear out Sir Monier-Williams’ optimistic views. Nor yet is this opinion supported by what the whole world knows of modern France, Germany and Italy, eaten to the core with free-thought and Atheism. To say, therefore, as the lecturer did, that he doubts “were a trustworthy census possible” if Buddhism would give even 150 millions of Buddhists, or rather pseudo-Buddhists, as against 450 millions of Ch ristians in the world’s population, estimated at 1,500 millions [ Scotsman .]*"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"—is rather a risky thing. Let us not talk of “ pseudo- Buddhists” in the face of millions of “ pseudo -Christians,” nominal and more “Grundy-fearing” than God-fearing; and for this reason still pretending to be called Christians. And if the term pseudo was applied by the lecturer to the teeming millions of China, Japan, and Tibet, who have fallen off from the purity of the primitive church of Buddha, burning low even in Siam, Burma, and Ceylon, and which have split themselves into many sects, then just the same is found in the 300 or so of Protestant sects, which differ so widely and fight for dogmatic differences, and still call themselves Christians. “Were a trustworthy census possible,” and a fair appreciation of truth preferred to self-glorification, then the 2,000,000 of Freethinkers, –––––––––– * Says Emil Schlagintweit, in his Bu ddhism in Tibet , pp. 11-12, in comparing the number of Buddhists to that of Christians—“For these regions of Asia [China,Japan, Indo-Chinese Peninsula, etc.], we obtain, therefore, according to these calculations [of Prof. Dieterici], an approximate total of 534 millions of inhabitants. At least two-thirds of this population may be considered to be Buddhist; the remainder includes the followers of Confucius and Lao-tse.” Result, according to Dieterici, 340,000,000 of Buddhists and only 330,000,000 of Christians—all nominal Christians included.

This inaccuracy may be better appreciated by throwing a glance at the census-tables of India of 1881. In that country indeed, where missionaries have been labouring for centuries, and where they are now as numerous—and quite as mischievous—as the crows in the land of Manu, the distribution of its religious denominations stands in round numbers as follows: Hindus (male and female ... 188,000,000 Mohammedans ... 50,000,000 Aborigines ... 7,000,000 Buddhists ... 3,050,000 Jains (Buddhists) ... 1,020,000 Christians ... 1,800,000 The 1,800,000 of Christians, note well, include all the Europeans resident in India, the army, the civil servants, the Eurasians and native Christians. And is it to curry further favour with his Sabbath-worshipping audience and elicit from it further applause, that the knighted lecturer characterised Buddhism as “a false, diseased and moribund system, which had continued [nevertheless?!] for more than two thousand years to attract and delude immense populations”? This, in the teeth of his great Oxford rival, Professor Max Müller, who pronounces the moral code of Buddhism “one of the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"most perfect the world has ever known.” So do Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire, Klaproth, and other Orientalists, more fair minded than the lecturer under notice. Says Mr. P. Hordern, the Director of Public Instruction in Burma:— “The poor heathen is guided in his daily life by precepts older and no t less noble than the precepts of Christianity. Centuries before the birth of Christ, men were taught by the life and doctrine of one of the greatest men who ever lived, lessons of pure morality. The child is taught to obey his parents, and to be tender to all animal life, the man to love his neighbour as himself, to be true and just in all his dealings, and to look beyond the 14 6  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS vain shows of the world for true happiness. Every shade of vice is guarded by special precepts. Love in its wid est sense of universal charity is declared to be the mother of all the virtues, and even the peculiarly Christian precepts of the forgiveness of injuries, and the meek acceptance of insult were already taught in the farthest East, ages before Christianity.* Such is “the false and diseased system” of Buddhism which is less “moribund” ho wever, even now, than is in our present age the perverted system of Him whose Sermon on the Mount, grand as it is, yet taught nothing that had not been taught ages before. I will show presently, on the authority of statistics and the Church again, which of the two—Buddhists or Christians—live more nearly according to the grand and the same morality preached by their respective Masters. The Professor is more lenient though to the Founder than to the system. He would not, he said: Be far wrong in asserting that intense individuality, fervid earnestness, severe simplicity of character, co mbined with singular beauty of countenance, calm dignity of bearing, and almost super-human persuasiveness of speech, were conspicuous in the great teacher. — [ Scotsman. ] Forthwith, however, and fearing he had said too much, the Professor hastened to throw a g loomy shadow on the bright picture drawn. To quote from the Scotsman once more: Alluding to the first sermon of the Buddha, the lecturer remarked that, however unfavourably it might co mpare with the first discourse of Christ—a discourse, not addressed to a few monks, but to suffering sinners—it was of great interest, because it embodied the first teaching of one who, if not worthy to be called the “ Light of Asia ” and certainly unworthy of comparison with the “Light of the World,” was at least one of the world’s most successful teachers.

The actual existence of Gautama Buddha cannot be called in question; neither Materialist nor Christian, Jew nor Gentile, can ever presume to call him a myth. On the other hand, ( a ) the “Light of the World,” having failed to illumine the whole of Humanity—as even on the lecturer’s admission only 400 out of 1,500 millions of the world population are Christians—the title is a misnomer most evidently, and ( b ) the very personal existence of the Founder of Christianity—mostly on account of the supernatural character claimed for it, but also because no valid, real, historical evidence can be brought forward to prove it—is now denied by millions of not only Free-thinkers and Materialists, but even of intellectual Christians and critical Bible-scholars. Nor are the remarks of Sir Monier-Williams concerning the death of Buddha “said to have been caused by eating too much pork, or dried boar’s flesh ,” any happier. That fact alone that one, who claims to be regarded as a great Orientalist, and yet observes that: “As this statement was somewhat derogatory to his [Buddha’s] dignity, it was less likely to have been fabricated,” shows in a “Sanskrit scholar” a pitiable ignorance of Hindu symbolism, as well as a wonderful lack of intuition. How one who is acquainted with the primitive and original teachings of Buddha, as recorded by his personal disciples, can think for a moment that the great Asiatic Reformer ate flesh, passes comprehension!

The great doctrine delivered by Gautama a few days before he entered Nirvana to Maha Ka \u0001 yapa, contains among other prohibitions th a t of eating animal food. The “Great Development School refers it to this period,” says the same authority upon Chinese Buddhism, and no lover of it, the Rev. J. Edkins; and the"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Bodhisattwas are even more strictly prohibited than even monks. In “The Book of Heaven through keeping the Ten prohibitions” a Deva informs Buddha that he was born in Indra ® akra’s heaven “for keeping them; for not inflicting death, or stealing, or committing adultery . . . or drinking wine, or eating flesh, ” etc. The scholar who knows that the first Avatar of Brahmâ was in the shape of a boar, and who is aware, ( a ) that the Brahmins have ever identified themselves with the God from whom they claim descent; and ( b ) know the bitter opposition they offered to the “World’s Honoured One,” Gautama Buddha, trying to take more than once his life, will readily comprehend the allusion in the allegory. It is an esoteric tradition, and is no longer extant in writing, any more than is the explanation of many other allegories. Yet the inconsistency alone of the charge ought to have suggested to the mind of any less prejudiced scholar the suspicion that the legend of Tsonda’s meal of rice and pork was some esoteric allegory. No wonder if even Bishop Bigandet remarks that “a thick veil wraps in complete obscurity this curious episode of Buddha’s life.” It is “the obscurity” of ignorance. It is quite true that Buddhists lay no claim to “ supernatural inspiration” for their sacred scriptures, and it is in this that lies a portion of their success. The word “priest,” the audience was told, could not be applied to Buddhist monks “because they have no divine revelation.” At this rate there never were any priests before the Jews and Christians as no “ divine revelation” is allowed to any nation outside these two? Further the lecturer elicited a great laugh and applause by telling his audience the following anecdote: Gautama Buddha also instituted an order of nuns, and the monks once asked Gautama, it was said, what the y should do when they saw C HRISTIAN L ECTURES ON B UDDHISM  149 women. The Buddha replied, “Do not see them.” They then asked, “But if we do see them?” He replied, “T hen don’t speak to them.” “But,” they asked, “if they speak to us?” And the Buddha answered, “Then do not answer them; let your thoughts be fixed in profound meditation.” (Laughter.)—[ Scotsman. ] Verses 27 and 28 in Chapter v of Matthew, lend themselves as easily to satirical re marks. The injunction by Buddha, “let your thoughts be fixed in profound meditation,” is virtually implied in that other injunction, “Ye have heard. . . Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.” Were the Christians to follow this command of their noble Master as faithfully as Buddhists do the orders of their Lord—there would be no need for the establishment in England of a “Vigilance Society” for the protection of female children and girls; nor would the editor of the Pall Mall have got three months’ imprisonment for telling the truth and speaking against a crying and horrid evil, unheard-of in Buddhist communities. Further, the lecturer remarked, that “Gautama never tolerated priestcraft.” Nor has Jesus, and I maintain it; His denunciations of sacerdotalism and the Rabbis who teach the Law of Moses and lay heavy burdens on men’s shoulders which “they themselves will not move with one of their fingers,” ( Matt . , xxiii, 4); His prohibition to make a parade of"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"prayers in synagogues and command to enter into one’s closet to pray ( Matt ., v, 27-28); as also the absence of any injunction from him to establish a dogmatic church—prove it. Therefore Sir M. Williams’ accusation that Buddha’s “followers in other countries became entangled in a network of sacerdotalism more enslaving than that from which he had rescued them,” applies to Christianity with far greater force than to Buddhism. And if “the precept enjoining celibacy sufficiently accounted for the fact that Buddhism never gained any stability or permanency in India,” how is it that the Roman Catholics, whose religion enjoins the same precept for priests and monks, show such tremendous odds against 150  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Pr otestantism? And if celibacy be “a transgression of the laws of nature,” as the lecturer says—and so say the Brahmins, for even Gautama Buddha was married and had a son before he became an ascetic—why should Jesus have never married and advised celibacy, to his disciples? For it is celibacy at best, which is enjoined to those who are able to receive it in verses 10, 11 and 12, of Matthew xix, the literal term implying still worse . . . . “and there are eunuchs, which made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.” So that monastic Buddhism, it seems, is called idiotic by the lecturer only for doing that which Jesus Christ himself advised his disciples to do, if they can. A very curious way of glorifying one’s God! As to the respective merits of Buddhism and Christianity, as a Buddhist who may be suspected of partiality, I shall leave the burden of establishing the comparison to the Christians themselves. This is what one reads in the Tablet, the leading organ of Roman Catholic Englishmen, about Creeds and Criminality. I underline the most remarkable statements. The official statement as to the moral and material progress of India, which has recently been published, s u pplies a very interesting contribution to the controversy on the missionary question. It appears from these figures that while we effect a very marked moral deterioration in the natives by converting them to our creed, THEIR NATURAL STANDARD OF MORALITY IS SO HIGH that, however much we Christianize them, we c annot succeed in making them altogether as bad as ourselves. The figures representing the proportions of criminality in the several classes, are as follows:— E UROPEANS  . . . . 1 in 274 Eurasians *  . . . . 1 in 509 Native Christians . . . . 1 in 799 Mahomedans . . . . 1 in 856 Hindoos  . . . . 1 in 1,361 B UDDHISTS  . . . . 1 in 3,787 –––––––––– * The fruits of European chastity and moral virtue, and of the obedience of Christians to the commands of Jesus."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"–––––––––– C HRISTIAN L ECTURES ON B UDDHISM  151 The last item, [says the Ta blet ] is a magnificent tribute to the exalted purity of Buddhism, but the statistics are instructive throughout, and enforce with resistless power the conclusion that, as a mere matter of social polity, we should do much better if we devoted our superfluous cash and zeal, for a generation or two, to the ethical improvement of our own countrymen, instead of trying to upset the morality, together with the theology, of people WHO MIGHT REASONABLY SEND OUT MISSIONS TO CONVERT US . No better answer than this could a Buddhist find as a reply to the uncharitable and in correct comparisons between the two creeds instituted by Sir Monier-Williams. He should remember, however, the words of his Master, “Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.” ––––––––– To this rejoinder by a Buddhist to the Oxford Professor we may append a few more interesting facts from Buddhists, in this connection. They are very suggestive, inasmuch as firstly they show how religious bigotry and intolerance make people entirely blind and deaf to every fact and reason; and secondly how we, Europeans, understand fairness and justice. The extracts that follow are taken from a Singhalese newspaper, the organ of the Ceylon Buddhists and edited by Buddhist Theosophists. It is called The Sarasavisandaresa. The two editorials, written in English, of the 14th and the 27th of February of the present year, contain two complaints; the first of which is against the very notorious editor of the Colombo Observer. This personage, than whom no more slanderous or wicked bigot ever walked the earth, as shown by his being perpetually brought to justice for defamation by Christians and natives—is a deep-water Baptist, without one spark of Christian ethics in him. His sledge-hammer-like charges against Buddhism, will appear curious after the fair confession of the Tablet just quoted. But we shall let our Brother editor—a Buddhist Theosophist—speak for his countrymen. For unless their grievances are brought to the notice of at least a portion of the English readers in Lucifer, there is little chance indeed that the outside 152  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS wo rld should ever hear of them from other papers or magazines. Says the editorial on “Crime in Ceylon”:— We notice a paragraph in our contemporary the Ob server referring to an atrocious crime recently committed in the neighbourhood of Ratnapura. According to the account given one man murdered another, and “then, standing over him, committed an offence which cannot even be mentioned.” While we have no"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"idea what this can mean, we have no doubt that some horrible atrocity is intended, and we sincerely hope that the fullest justice will be meted out to the abominable villain who committed it. But of course the insane bigotry of our contemporary would not allow him to be satisfied with merely giving the dreadful news; no, he must add a comment which is itself, in the eyes of all right-thinking men, an atrocity of the blackest description. We regret to give the publicity of our wider circulation to so scandalous a remark; yet we feel it our duty to let our countrymen see to what despicable shifts the missionary organ is reduced in its futile efforts to find some ground to vilify our faith. “Is there any country under the sun,” it asks,—“any people save Buddhists—where and by whom such awful atrocities could be perpetrated?” Unhesitatingly we answer “Yes; whatever the crime may have been, its horror is more than equalled— it is surpassed—by the diabolical outrages committed in Christian England in this nineteenth century.” Follow several noted facts of crimes recently committed in England. But, pertinently re marks the editor:— Does our contemporary wish that Christianity as a system should be held responsible for the ghastly cr imes daily committed in its very strongholds? Such a course would be obviously unfair, yet his sense of honour permits him to treat Buddhism in the same manner. Observe that there is no evidence at all that the criminal professes Buddhism; we know nothing of the facts of the case, but arguing from experience the presumption would be against such a supposition. At the present moment there are three prisoners under sentence of death in Welikada Jail, all of whom are Christians; and there are also two Christians (one of them a church official) convicted of murder at Kurunagala. . . . . . . . . The proportion of crime among Christians is about fifteen times as great as among Buddhists; and it is co nsidered a truism in India to say that every person perverted to Christianity from some other religion adds one more to the suspected list of the police. This is a fact, and all who have been in India will hardly deny it. C HRISTIAN L ECTURES ON B UDDHISM  153 Th e other case is a crime of Vandalism, though to desecrate other nations’ sacred relics is considered no crime at all by the Christian officials. It tells eloquently its own tale: A DESECRATION A very unpleasant rumour has reached us from Anuradhapura. It is well known that men have been at wo rk there for a long time under the orders of the Government Agent, professedly restoring the ruined Dagobas. This, so far, is a truly royal work, and one with which we have every sympathy. But now report says that the work of restoration, which consisted chiefly in clearing away the ruins and masses of fallen earth, so that the beautiful carvings and statues might once more be visible in their entirety as at first, has been abandoned in favour of excavations into the Dagobas themselves. We hear that a tunnel has been pierced almost into the centre of the great Abhayagiriya Dagoba in search of treasure, relics, and ancient books, and it is further reported that some important discoveries have already been made, but that whatever has been found has been secretly removed by night. It is said, too, that when the High Priest of the Sacred B O -T REE , to whom the Dagoba belongs, applied for permission to see the articles exhumed, only a very sm all portion was shown to him."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Now we can scarcely bring ourselves to admit the possibility of all this; it seems quite incredible that a government like that of the English should stain its annals with such an act of vandalism as the desecration of our sacred places, though certainly if it could descend to such an action it would be quite in keeping that the treasure-trove should be removed secretly and guiltily. No doubt it would be difficult for even the more liberal-minded of our foreign rulers to understand fully the thrill of horror which every true Buddhist would feel on hearing of the disturbance of these time-honoured monuments. It would probably be argued by Christians that whatever may be buried under the Dagobas, whether relics, treasure, or books, is quite useless where it is; whereas if brought to light the books would supply very valuable copies of old Pali texts, the treasures (if any) would be useful to the Government, and the relics would be an interesting acquisition to the shelves of the British Museum. Singhalese Buddhists, however, in spite of centuries of oppression and persecution under Dutch and Portuguese adventurers, have still a deeply-rooted feeling of respect and love for the monuments of the golden age of their religion, and to hear that they are being disturbed by the sacrilegious hand of the foreigner will stir them to their inmost souls. These Dagobas are now objects of veneration to thousands of pilgrims, not only from all parts of Ceylon, but also from other Buddhist countries; but if once the relics buried in them are 15 4  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS removed, they will be no more to us than any other mound of earth. Even if, as has been suggested, the Go vernment intend merely to examine whatever may be discovered, and afterwards replace it, to our ideas the disturbance of the sacred monuments of our religion by alien hands would still be terrible desecration, against which every true-hearted Buddhist ought at once to protest most vigorously by every means in his power. If the sad news be true, Buddhists should at once combine to hold indignation meetings all over the country, and to get up a monster petition to the Governor begging him to prevent the recurrence of such an outrage on their religious feelings. But until confirmation arises we cling to the hope that the rumours may be baseless, and should this prove to be the case none will rejoice more heartily than we. We trust that the Government Agent of the Province, or some responsible official connected with the work, will embrace this opportunity of telling the public what is really being done at Anuradhapura, and thereby relieve the anxiety which must agitate all Buddhist hearts until the question is set at rest. The Abhayagiriya Dagoba was erected by King Walagambahu in the year B.C . 89, to commemorate the re covery of his throne after the expulsion of the Malabar invaders. When entire, it was the most stupendous Dagoba in Ceylon, being 405 feet high, and standing on about eight acres of ground; but so ruthlessly have the older destroyers done their work that its present height is not much more than 230 feet. At its base are some very fine specimens of stone carving, and various fragments of bold frescoes. The Dagoba is quite encircled with the ruins of buildings large and small, for a larger college of priests was attached to this than to any of the other sacred places at Anuradhapura. We hope our Singhalese Colleague and Brother will send us further information upon th is subject. Every Theosophist and lover of antiquity, whether Christian or of alien faith, would deplore with the Buddhists the loss of such precious relics of a period the editor has so aptly described as “the golden age of their religion.” We hope it may not be true. But alas, we are in Kali Yuga.

It becomes necessary therefore, to state once for all:— ( a ) The essential difference between theoretical and practical Occultism; or what is generally known as Theosophy on the one hand, and Occult science on the other, and:— ( b ) The nature of the difficulties involved in the study of the latter. It is easy to become a Theosophist. Any person of average intellectual capacities, and a leaning toward the meta-physical; of pure, unselfish life, who finds more joy in helping his neighbour than in receiving help himself; one who is ever ready to sacrifice his own pleasures for the sake of other people; and who loves Truth, Goodness and Wisdom for their own sake, not for the benefit they may confer—is a Theosophist. But it is quite another matter to put oneself upon the path which leads to the knowledge of what is good to do, as to the right discrimination of good from evil; a path which also leads a man to that power through which he can do the good he desires, often without even apparently lifting a finger. Moreover, there is one important fact with which the student should be made acquainted. Namely, the enormous, almost limitless, responsibility assumed by the teacher for the sake of the pupil. From the Gurus of the East who teach openly or secretly, down to the few Kabalists in Western lands who undertake to teach the rudiments of the Sacred Science to their disciples—those western Hierophants being often themselves ignorant of the danger they incur—one and all of these “Teachers” 156  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS ar e subject to the same inviolable law. From the moment they begin really to teach, from the instant they confer any power—whether psychic, mental or physical—on their pupils,"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"they take upon themselves all the sins of that pupil, in connection with the Occult Sciences, whether of omission or commission, until the moment when initiation makes the pupil a Master and responsible in his turn. There is a weird and mystic religious law, greatly reverenced and acted upon in the Greek, half-forgotten in the Roman Catholic, and absolutely extinct in the Protestant Church. It dates from the earliest days of Christianity and has its basis in the law just stated, of which it was a symbol and an expression. This is the dogma of the absolute sacredness of the relation between the god-parents who stand sponsors for a child.* These tacitly take upon themselves all the sins of the newly baptised child— (anointed, as at the initiation, a mystery truly!)—until the day when the child becomes a responsible unit, knowing good and evil. Thus it is clear why the \"Teachers\" are so reticent, and why “Chelas” are required to serve a seven years probation to prove their fitness, and develop the qualities necessary to the security of both Master and pupil. Occultism is not magic. It is comparatively easy to learn the trick of spells and the methods of using the subtler, but still material, forces of physical nature; the powers of the animal soul in man are soon awakened; the forces which his love, his hate, his passion, can call into operation, are readily developed. But this is Black Magic— Sorcery. For it is the motive, and the motive alone , which makes any exercise of power become black, malignant, or white, beneficent Magic. It is impossible to employ spiritual forces if there is the slightest tinge of selfishness remaining in the operator. For, unless the intention is –––––––––– * So holy is the connection thus formed deemed in the Greek Church, that a marriage between go d-parents of the same child is regarded as the worst kind of incest, is considered illegal and is dissolved by law; and this absolute prohibition extends even to the children of one of the sponsors as regards those of the other. –––––––––– P RACTICAL O CCULTISM  157 en tirely unalloyed, the spiritual will transform itself into the psychic, act on the astral plane, and dire results may be produced by it. The powers and forces of animal nature can equally be used by the selfish and revengeful, as by the unselfish and the all-forgiving; the powers and forces of spirit lend themselves only to the perfectly pure in heart—and this is D IVINE M AGIC . Wh at are then the conditions required to become a student of the “Divina Sapientia”? For let it be known that no such instruction can possibly be given unless these certain conditions are complied with, and rigorously carried out during the years of study. This is a sine qua non. No man can swim unless he enters deep water. No bird can fly unless its wings are grown, and it has space before it and courage to trust itself to the air. A man who will wield a two-edged sword, must be a thorough master of the blunt weapon, if he would not injure himself—or what is worse—others, at the first attempt.

[The place must be set apart, and used for no other purpose. The five “sacred colours” are the prismatic hu es arranged in a certain way, as these colours are very magnetic.

What is miscalled “friendly rivalry” is assiduously cultivated and the same spirit is fostered and strengthened in every detail of life. With such ideas “educated into” him from his childhood, how can a Westerner bring himself to feel towards his co-students “as the fingers on one hand”? Those co-students, too, are not of his own selection, or chosen by himself from personal sympathy and appreciation. They are chosen by his teacher on far other grounds, and he who would be a student must first be strong enough to kill out in his heart all feelings of dislike and"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"antipathy to others. How many Westerners are ready even to attempt this in earnest? And then the details of daily life, the command not to touch even the hand of one's nearest and dearest. How contrary to Western notions of affection and good feeling! How cold and hard it seems. Egotistical too, people would say, to abstain from giving pleasure to others for the sake of one’s own development. Well, let those who think so defer till another lifetime the attempt to enter the path in real earnest. But let them not glory in their own fancied unselfishness. For, in reality, it is only the seeming appearances which they allow to deceive them, the conventional notions, based on emotionalism and gush, or so-called courtesy, things of the unreal life, not the dictates of Truth. But even putting aside these difficulties, which may be considered “external,“ though their importance is none the less great, how are students in the West to “attune themselves” to harmony as here required of them? So strong has personality grown in Europe and America that there is no school of artists even whose members do not hate and are not jealous of each other. “Professional” hatred and envy have become proverbial; men seek each to benefit himself at all costs, and even the so-called courtesies of life are but a hollow mask covering these demons of hatred and jealousy. In the East the spirit of “non-separateness” is inculcated as steadily from childhood up, as in the West the 162  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS sp irit of rivalry. Personal ambition, personal feelings and desires, are not encouraged to grow so rampant there. When the soil is naturally good, it is cultivated in the right way, and the child grows into a man in whom the habit of subordination of one’s lower to one’s higher Self is strong and powerful. In the West men think that their own likes and dislikes of other men and things are guiding principles for them to act upon, even when they do not make of them the law of their lives and seek to impose them upon others.

II, No. 8, April, 1888, pp. 155-160] To the Editors of Lucifer. As you invite questions, I take the liberty of submitting one to your consideration. Is it not to be expected (basing one’ reasoning on Theosophical teaching) that the meeting and intercourse in Kama-loka of persons truly attached to each other must be fraught with disappointment, nay frequently even with deep grief? Let me illustrate my meaning by an example: A mother departs this life twenty years before her son, who, deeply attached to her, longs to meet her again, and only finds her “shell,” from which all those spiritual qualities have fled which to him were the essential part of the being he loved. Even the \"shell\" itself, by its resemblance to the former body, only adds to his grief by keeping early memories more vividly alive, and showing him the vast difference between the entity he knew on earth and the remnant he finds. Or take a second case: The son meets his mother in Kama-loka after a short separation, only to find her entity in a state of disintegration, as her pure spirit has already begun to leave her astral body and to ascend towards Devachan. He has to witness this process of gradual dissolution, and day by day he feels his mother's spirit slip away whilst his more material nature prevents him from joining in her rapid progress. I subjoin my name and address, though not for publication, and remain, Very truly yours, “F . T. S.” E DITORS ’ R EPLY .—Our Correspondent seems to have been misled as to the state of co nsciousness which entities experience in Kama-loka. He seems to have formed his conceptions on the visions of living psychics and the revelations of living mediums. But all conclusions drawn from such data are vitiated by the fact, that a living organism intervenes between the observer and the Kama-loka state per se. There can be no conscious meeting in Kama-loka, hence no grief. There is no astral disintegration pari passu with the separation of the shell from the spirit. 164  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Ac cording to the Eastern teaching the state of the deceased in Kama-loka is not what we, living men, would recognise as “conscious.” It is rather that of a person stunned and"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"dazed by a violent blow, who has momentarily “lost his senses.” Hence in Kama-loka there is as a rule (apart from vicarious life and consciousness awakened through contact with mediums) no recognition of friends or relatives, and therefore such a case as stated here is impossible. We meet those we loved only in Devachan, that subjective world of perfect bliss, the state which succeeds the Kama-loka, after the separation of the principles. In Devachan all our personal, unfulfilled spiritual desires and aspirations will be realised; for we shall not be living in the hard world of matter but in those subjective realms wherein a desire finds its instant realisation; because man himself is there a god and a creator. In dealing with the dicta of psychics and mediums, it must always be remembered that they translate, automatically and unconsciously, their experiences on any plane of consciousness, into the language and experience of our normal physical plane. And this confusion can only be avoided by the special study-training of occultism, which teaches how to trace and guide the passage of impressions from one plane to another and fix them on the memory. Kama-loka may be compared to the dressing-room of an actor, in which he divests himself of the costume of the last part he played before rebecoming himself properly—the immortal Ego or the Pilgrim cycling in his Round of Incarnations. The Eternal Ego being stripped in Kama-loka of its lower terrestrial principles, with their passions and desires, it enters into the state of Devachan. And therefore it is said that only the purely spiritual, the nonmaterial emotions, affections, and aspirations accompany the Ego into that state of Bliss. But the process of stripping off the lower, the fourth and part of the fifth, principles is an unconscious one in all normal human beings. It is only in very exceptional cases that there is a slight return to consciousness in Kama-loka: and this is the case of very materialistic unspiritual personalities, who, devoid of the C ORRESPONDENCE  165 co nditions requisite, cannot enter the state of absolute Rest and Bliss. –––––––––– To the Editors of L u cifer .

Also, being an organic Whole, what is the form of the All? And is the form, whatever it is, not also the form of the self-existent Cause or God? Is nature co-eternal with God? Or was there a time, or rather state, when God, the self-existent One, was all in all, before nature was produced from himself? I cannot think of anything of nature, spirit, soul, or God, without the ideas of size, form, number, and relation. So there can be no Life, Law, Cause, or Force, formless in itself, yet causative of forms. All evolutions are in, by, and unto forms; the All-evolver is Himself all Form. The truth of the Universe is the Form of the Universe. The Truth of God is the Form of God. What Form is that? To attain to that is the great attainment for the intelligence at least. In these few lines my aim is mainly an enquiry. Respectfully yours, J. W. H UNTER . Ed inburgh, 29th March, 1888. E DITORS ’ R EPLY .—According to the Eastern philosophy a unity composed of “many en tities, parts, or forms” is a compound unity on the plane of Maya —illusion or ignorance. The One universal divine Unity cannot be a differentiated whole, however much “organized into a body of harmony.” Organization implies external work out of materials at hand, and can never be connected with the self-existent, eternal, and unconditioned Absolute Unity. This ONE SELF , absolute intelligence and existence, therefore non -i ntelligence and non -existence (to the finite and conditioned perception of man), is “ impartite, beyond the range of speech and thought and is the substract of all” teaches Vedantasara in its introductory Stanza. How, then, can the Infinite and the Boundless, the unconditioned and the absolute, be of any size ? The question can only apply to a dwarfed reflection of the uncreate ray on the mayavic plane, or our phenomenal Universe; to one of the finite Elohim, who was most probably in the mind of our correspondent. To the (philosophically) untrained Pantheist, who identifies the objective Kosmos with the 168  B LAVATSK Y: C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" abstract Deity, and for whom Kosmos and Deity are synonymous terms, the form of the illusive objectivity must be the form of that Deity. To the (philosophically) trained Pantheist, the abstraction, or the noumenon , is the ever to be unknown Deity, the one eternal reality, formless, because homogeneous and impartite; boundless, because Omnipresent—as otherwise it would only be a contradiction in ideas not only in terms; and the concrete phenomenal form—its vehicle— no better than an aberration of the ever-deceiving physical senses. “Is nature co-eternal with God?” It depends on what is meant by “nature.” If it is objective phenomenal nature, then the answer is—though ever latent in divine Ideation, but being only periodical as a manifestation, it cannot be co-eternal. But “abstract” nature and Deity, or what our correspondent calls “Self-existent cause or God,” are inseparable and even identical. Theosophy objects to the masculine pronoun used in connection with the Self-existent Cause, or Deity. It says IT —inasmuch as that “Cause” the rootless root of al l—is neither male, female, nor anything to which an attribute—something always conditioned, finite, and limited—can be applied. The confession made by our esteemed correspondent that he “cannot think of anything of nature, spirit[!], soul or God [!!] without the ideas of size, form, number, and relation,” is a living example of the sad spirit of anthropomorphism in this age of ours. It is this theological and dogmatic anthropomorphism which has begotten and is the legitimate parent of materialism. If once we realize that form is merely a temporary perception dependent on our physical senses and the idiosyncrasies of our physical brain and has no existence, per se, then this illusion that formless cause cannot be causative of forms will soon vanish. To think of Space in relation to any limited area, basing oneself on its three dimensions of length, breadth, and thickness, is strictly in accordance with mechanical ideas; but it is inapplicable in metaphysics and transcendental philosophy. To say then that “The Truth of God is the Form of God,” is to ignore even the exotericism of the Old Testament. “And the Lord spake unto you out of the C ORRESPONDENCE   169 mi dst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude . . . .” ( Deut ., iv, 12). And to think of the All-Evolver as something which has “size, form, number, and relation,” is to think of a finite and conditioned personal God, a part only of the ALL . And in such case, why should this part be better than its fellow-parts? Why not believe in Gods—the other rays of the All-Light? To say—“Among the gods who is like Thee O Lord” does not make the God so addressed really “the god of gods” or any better than his fellow-gods; it simply shows that every nation made a god of its own, and then, in its great ignorance and superstition, served and flattered and tried to propitiate that god. Polytheism on such lines, is more rational and philosophical than anthropomorphous monotheism. ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"To the Editors of Lucifer. Several questions have of late occurred to me at the entry of the subject of Theosophy. . . . I am quite new to the study, and must perforce express myself crudely. I gather that an early result of entire devotion to an inner contemplative life, and a life also of fine unselfishness, such a life as is calculated to allow of the growth of faculties otherwise dormant, that a result of this life will be a growing recognition of the underlying unity of man and his surroundings, that to such a man truth will make itself known from within, and therefore will claim instant acceptance and unquestionable certitude; that in fact the longer that such a life is lived with unfading enthusiasm, the higher will the central spirit rise in self-assertion, the wider will be the survey of creation, and the more immediate the apprehension of truth; also that with these tends to develop a greater physical command of the forces of nature. Now I submit that such a life as is here spoken of, is led by men who attain to none of these results. Most of us know Christians who seem never to have a selfish thought, who exist in an atmosphere of self-sacrifice for others, and whose leisure is all spent in meditation and in emotional prayer, which surely is seeking after truth. Yet they do not attain it. They fail to rise out of Christianity into Theosophy; they remain for ever limited to, and satisfied with the narrow space they move in. (1) It may be replied that they do expand slowly. Granted, for some of them. But my point is that there do exist (and one is enough for my purpose) men, and particularly women, leading lives both of spiritual meditation and of 1 7 0  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS unselfishness, to whom nevertheless is not vouchsafed a clearer view of the great universe, a larger ap prehension of Theosophic truth, nor any increased physical command of nature. (2) As regards the last point, take for an example John Stuart Mill. Surely he lived always in the white light of exalted contemplation and instant readiness of high unselfishness; yet to him came no dawn of Theosophic light, nor any larger hold upon the forces of material nature. (3) May I ask now for a word of explanation on this point? I apologise for the trouble I give, and for my want of ability in unfolding my difficulty. H.C. E DITORS ’ R EPLY .—(1) Nowhere in the theosophic teachings was it stated that a life of en tire devotion to one’s duty alone, or “a contemplative life,” graced even by “fine unselfishness” was sufficient in itself to awaken dormant faculties and lead man to the apprehension of final truths, let alone spiritual powers. To lead such life is an excellent and meritorious thing, under any circumstances, whether one be a Christian or a Mussulman, a Jew, Buddhist or Brahmin, and according to Eastern philosophy it must and will benefit a person, if not in his present, then in his future existence on earth, or what we call rebirth. But to expect that leading the best of lives helps one—without the help of philosophy and esoteric wisdom—to perceive “the soul of things” and develops in him “a physical command of the forces of nature,” i.e., endows him with abnormal or adept powers—is really too sanguine. Less than by any one else can such results be achieved by a sectarian of whatever exoteric creed. For the path to which his meditation is confined, and upon which his contemplation travels, is too narrow, too thickly covered with the weeds of dogmatic beliefs—the fruits of human fancy and error—to permit the pure ray of any Universal truth to shine upon it. His is a blind faith, and when his eyes open he has to give it up and cease being a “Christian” in the theological sense.

These means can at best help to psychic development. If our correspondent is anxious to learn the difference between Spiritual and Psychic wisdom, between Sophia and Psyche, let him turn to the Greek text (the English translation is garbled) in the Epistle of James, iii, 15-16, and he will know that one is divine and the other terrestrial, “sensual devilish.” (2) The same applies to the second case in hand, and even to the third. (3) Both— i.e., persons in general, leading lives of spiritual meditation, and those who like John Stuart Mill live “always in the white light of exalted contemplation,” do not pursue truth in the right direction, and therefore they fail; moreover John Stuart Mill set up for himself an arbitrary standard of truth, inasmuch as he made his physical consciousness the final court of appeal. His was a case of a wonderful development of the intellectual and terrestrial side of psyche or soul, but Spirit he rejected as all Agnostics do.

He rightly scorns to pander to a spurious sentiment of delicacy, and does not hesitate to penetrate into the very arcana of vice when the necessities of his task demand it The prurience of the Christian Fathers, the debaucheries of Inquisitors, the shameless prostitution of “Religion” to depravity which is noticeable in ancient and even in modern times, the indirect manner in which unfortunate passages in the Bible—interpolations let us hope—have ministered to the lust of bigots and fanatics, the fatal effects of “faith” and emotionalism in worship, all these things, and many more, are dealt with in a most forcible manner The author’s facts are unimpeachable, his criticism scathing, but the general conclusions which he draws from them are not always of a nature to command the acceptance of even the most resolute of liberal thinkers. For instance, when he states that “the essential essence of Christianity is opposed to that deliberate and judicial self-restraint which forms the barrier against licentiousness” (p. 77), he is, in our opinion, carried too far by the vehemence of a just revolt against the moral atrocities which have rendered theology such a mockery in the past. The “faith” to which he alludes as so pernicious to mental stability has its darker side; but it has also illumined, however irrationally, the lives of thousands of noble men and women. Similarly, in his anxiety to shift the whole burden of sexual depravity of Europe on to the back of Christianity, he extends his generalisation too freely. It has been remarked by many writers that the ghastly immoralities of ecclesiastical history are chargeable to individuals, not to the system itself. Vice must have had its outlet somehow, and all it needed was––opportunity. Consequently Mill and others have declined to regard the vices which spring up in the course of religious history as indicative of anything more than the necessary outcome of 174  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS hu man evolution. Nations mould their religion, not vice versa. With the ennobling of human ideas, a gradual metamorphosis of creeds must ensue. Consequently, instead of holding that the degradation of woman by priests and religionists is in itself a condemnation of the creed they profess, it would be more correct to put the truth thus: Christianity has done nothing to exalt woman, but has, on the contrary, retarded her progress. Mr. Ross’ position would be, then, very difficult to assail."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"If, however, he ascribes her treatment in the earlier centuries to the influence of Christianity, to what does he attribute her gradual promotion in the social scale? To the same cause, or to the slow amelioration of human knowledge and culture since the Renaissance?

Practical life and practical belief are rather mirrors of a nation's intellectual status than arbitrary facts which represent independent realities. Christianity has delayed human progress, rather than introduced a new noxious agency. It has, moreover, a distinctly fair side, viz .:—in largely contributing to render International Law possible by cementing together the peoples of Europe. Impartial Freethinkers, such as Lecky and others, have shown clearly enough that the pros and cons are balanced after all.

Readers of Lucifer will recall the recent review of the previous volume of the book in these columns, and the favourable criticisms which this brilliant writer then evoked. We have now simply to endorse that verdict, and, although unable to agree with the extreme conclusions occasionally arrived at by Mr. Ross, we cannot but see in the terrible indictment before us an impeachment of Christian morality which admits of no answer. Christian ethics and Christian practice are exposed and satirized with merciless severity, and the reader is confronted with a vast array of facts bearing on “modern civilization” which show the total inadequacy of present creeds to grapple with the vices and brutality of man. Woman is never dull; it is, on the contrary, so sparkling and versatile as to throw a charm even over the most plain-spoken passages where English impurity is brought to light. But let no reader of a pharisaical or fastidious turn of mind peruse his work. Saladin is a pure-minded and high-souled writer, but he stops at no revelation when he intends to prove his case. The annals of vice are deliberately sifted—from the support 176  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS a n d legalization of prostitution by the English Christian Government in the East down to the revolting secrets of “modern Babylon” at home. The exposure is not pleasant reading, it reads far worse than anything penned by Tacitus regarding Rome vice under the emperors, but it is unfortunately true. “And yet,” writes the author, after unveiling one hideous sore, “the pulpit and the religious press are possessed of sufficient ignorance [?] and effrontery to declare that Christianity has exalted the status of woman and sweetened and purified the atmosphere of social and domestic life.” To writers of this sort Woman will prove a very efficient eye-opener. ––––––––– "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME IX April, 1888 VISIONS [R EVIEW ] [ Lucifer, V ol. II, No. 8, April, 1888, pp. 164-165] [The author of this small book is Rev. Wm. Stainton Moses, who wrote under the pseudonym of “M. A. Oxon.” The review is unsigned, but the manner in which the subject-matter is treated suggests H.P.B.’s authorship. It contains several important keys of a psycho-spiritual nature.] In his Introduction to this little pamphlet, “M. A. Oxon.” strikes the key-note of his Vi sions. They are “teaching” or “instruction” to those whose wants they meet. In saying this, the author has, perhaps unwittingly, expressed a great fact, i.e., that for each one of us that is truth which meets our greatest need—whether moral, intellectual or emotional. As the author seems to feel, it matters very little whether these visions were subjective or objective. They conveyed to him certain moral truths with a directness and vividness which no other method of teaching could have attained. And whether we consider that these “Visions” were the thoughts of the intelligence teaching him impressed and objectivised in the recipient’s brain; or whether we think that in these visions the seer beheld V ISIONS   177 ob jective things—does not in any way alter their value as expressions of subtle truth. In many respects they resemble the visions seen by Swedenborg, and they share with the writings of that wonderful man the same curious personal colouring or shaping of the form in which they are cast, in accordance with the intellectual views and beliefs held by the seer. The “Visions” are instructive from several points of view. They offer a curious study to the student of psychology, who will trace in them the various elements due to the Seer and to the influences acting upon him. To the man in search of moral light, they will express truths of the inner life, known and recorded in many forms during the past ages of man’s life-history. They teach most impressively the cardinal doctrine of that inner life, viz ., that man is absolutely his own creator. To the student of practical psychic development, they speak of the difficulties which attend the opening of the psychic senses, of the difficulty of distinguishing between the creation of man’s own imagination and the more permanent creations of nature. There is a pathetic touch here and there, bringing out clearly the difficulties just"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"mentioned. The seer longs for the personal contact of earth and is told “to leave the personal.” How long will it be before this, the deepest truth of Theosophy, is in any sense realised even by such seers as M. A. Oxon? The clinging to personality is so strong that it is felt even in another state of consciousness. How then can it fail to colour and distort the pure truth, which is and must be absolutely impersonal? But this lesson is one hard to learn, so hard that many lives suffice not even for its comprehension. The statements on page 21 would seem to show that the visions recorded are those of the Devachanic state. For it [is] said that all the scenery and surroundings, the natural world of that plane in short, are the creations of the particular spirit with whose sphere the seer is in contact. This coincides perfectly with the Theosophic view, and when once this truth is really grasped, Spiritualists will realise how mistaken they have been in attacking a doctrine 178  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS w h ich is in reality what they have so long been seeking for, and which offers them the logical and philosophic system which they need as a basis for their investigations. The beauty of the thoughts expressed in the pages of this little book is very striking, and although the author expressly disclaims any literary merit, no one can fail to recognise the ability and truthfulness of expressions which characterise the work. All students will assuredly be grateful to M. A. Oxon for rendering these “Visions” easily accessible. [Col. Henry S. Olcott reviewed the same work in Th e Theosophist , Vol. IX, May, 1888, pp. 505-06. He pointed out that these “Visions” of Rev. Wm. Stainton Moses were the record of his psychic experiences on the 4th, 5th and 6th of September, 1877, during which he was instructed on the post-mortem condition of man by what appeared to him to be an outside agency of high degree of evolution and knowledge. Col. Olcott especially stresses the teaching regarding the nature of the after-death consciousness, and the fact that its world is of its own creation. He illustrates this point by saying: “In the course of my psychical researches I was once so fortunate as to be for a short time in literary collaboration with a noble English scholar who died several generations ago. He worked in a vast subjective library in ‘his castle in Spain,’ without a thought of rising higher towards Samadhi, but with all his vast intellectual power bent upon the pursuit of the philosophical study to which his earth-life had been devoted. . . .” This interesting statement has reference to the English Platonist Henry More (1614-1687), whose collaboration in the production of Isis Unveiled is fully described by Col. Olcott in his Old Diary Leaves , Vol. I, chap. xv. In the same work, chapters xviii, xix and xx, contain a considerable amount of interesting data concerning Rev. Wm.

I am one of those. Far from complaining of the “drubbing” I have received under the guise of a hearty reception, and as a testimony of welcome, upon my first appearance in Le Lotus, on the contrary, I am gratified by Madame Blavatsky’s courteous manner and the complete frankness of her language. In my eyes, these are evidences of her sincerity and cordiality, the less equivocal the more forthrightly given. No one would suspect this lady of toadyism with respect to Catholic priests—usually so readily cajoled, and for good reasons, in Ultramontane circles ( Ultramundane, some would say), where the religion of Christ has all to lose and nothing to gain. I am indebted, very greatly indebted, to her virile intellect, her Amazonian gait and her unceremonious pen, for presenting at the very outset the burning question of Christ “with a masculine vigor,” as the Editor remarks, and also, “without ambiguity and without partisanship.” Without partisanship . . . . . hum! We shall see. It may happen as it often does, that partisanship exists without one suspecting it oneself. We deceive ourselves so easily! It is so difficult to rid oneself of all personal interest, and, still more, of all partisanship of school, sect, church, caste, etc.! It is not then without reason that Jesus Christ said: “Deny yourselves, and do not swear by any Master, so that you may hold only to the pure Truth.” † In his own terms, quite as categorical as those of the Mahârâjâs of Benares, our Christ also declared: “There is no religion higher than Truth.” We shall soon see how he expressed himself on this point. Now Madame Blavatsky, and with her the Chelas and the Theosophists, have taken unto themselves Masters, the Mahâtmas. They –––––––––– * [In spite of its earlier date, it has been thought advisable to have this essay of Abbé Roca appear at this pa rticular place, as it has a direct connection with H. P.

From what the Adepts tell us, it would seem that they are ready to offer themselves to the world in their turn as doctors and teachers. That they have many things to teach us, I have not the least doubt. In the article to which my learned interlocutor replies, I have not done otherwise than render my homage to their wisdom. But when, perhaps a little intoxicated by the heady fumes of these encomiums, the Editor of Le Lotus exclaims and tells me by nods and winks, “who loves us, follows us,” I answer: Patience; I should greatly desire to love you at first sight; it would be easy and, moreover, perfectly Christian. I should like to follow you also, but on sure grounds, con pasos contados, and with the knowledge of where I am going. I find myself rather in the attitude of Aristotle; for me as for him, there is something which is of greater value than Plato, that is Truth. The phrase is well-known: “ Amicus Socrates, sed major Veritas ”! If then you are Truth, let us have it, but I must have absolute proof. Before Madame Blavatsky, it happens that another presented himself to the world who said squarely, “I am the TRUTH— Ego sum Veritas ”! He also told us: “Come unto me without fear, trust in my words, I am the Master, the unique Master, and the only true Doctor.” And again: “I am the Way, I am the Life, I am the Resurrection. ” * That is the language of Christ, and if it did not reveal God Himself, it would betray him as the most shameless of impostors. Now to say in the presence of Madame Blavatsky that Christ is an impostor should be carefully avoided, because she would reply with an outright smack on the mouth of the blasphemer. Draw your own conclusions, then. You will agree, gentlemen, that the way in which Christ puts the matter is even more daring and more masculine than that of your noble Directress. Here, indeed, one can say it is done “without ambiguity and without partisanship,” without any personal interest of any kind and with perfect renunciation of self. The testimony in favour of it is such that it stares at you and takes complete possession of you. None can be ignorant of the fact that the life of Jesus Christ was spent in multiplying undeniable evidences of his disinterestedness, and that his death was the supreme confirmation of it, the 9 \"DJLD\\\" J, 59 0D\\@L .

Believe me, Madame, the true Christians are not all dead with the last Gnostics, as you mistakenly declare. We have preserved, we also, even the Roman Church, however obscured and fallen it may be at this hour, that profound esotericism which is hidden under exoteric forms and uncomprehended dogmas, and which is found, nevertheless, under all religious symbols and all sacred traditions, in the West as well as in the East. If the sublime conception of that Christian ideal is that of the Mahâtmas, honour to them! But it is also that of the Kabalists and the true Catholics; I wish I could add of all the Theosophists, and of all the Occultists and of all the Hermetists. Like yourself, Madame, we distinguish between the PD0FJ`l of suffering and the PD4FJ`l of glory, an d we know that which you appear to be ignorant of, i.e., that the unction refused by you to Jesus Christ has streamed upon him with the blood of his own immolation, because every sacrificed being is a being consecrated or Christified, and he is perfectly annointed who is completely offered in bloody holocaust. Nevertheless, you will agree with this, Madame, in recalling the Cycle of initiation: “No ‘sacrificial victim’,” you say rightly, “could be united to Christ triumphant before passing through the preliminary stage of the suffering Christ who was put to death.” Very good! It is precisely to fulfil that ritualistic condition that “the Word made itself Flesh” according to St. John, and, consequently, that it becomes able, in our time, after nineteen centuries of crucifixion, to enter fully, before the whole world, into the divine light of the Christ-Spirit, because, as the wise Apostle of the Areopagus teaches, “Christ must suffer in order that he may enter into glory.”—“ oportuit Christum pati et it a intrare in gloriam. ”† The law is absolute, universal, it applies to Him who is the head, the chief, the “ Principium ” of mankind, and it applies also to each of the Monads, the cells or individual units of the universal social body of which that Christ is the epigenesic principle. None of us will enter that glorified body, which is to me the beatific Nirvâna of the Buddhists, without traversing that path which the Gospel calls the “strait gate and narrow way, angusta porta, et arcta via ” [ Matt., vii, 14]. Madame Blavatsky may now see the true meaning of the conversion of St. Paul which she has not"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"understood. St. Paul was an initiate of the Essenian school of Gamaliel, a true Therapeut, a perfect Nazarene, –––––––––– * [Paraphrase of Gal., ii, 20.— Co mp .] † [The Vulgate text for Luke , xxiv, 46 is: “Et dixit eis: Quoniam sic scriptum est, et sic oportebat Christum pati, et resurgere a mortuis tertia die.”— Compiler. ] –––––––––– R EPLY TO M ADAME B LAVATSKY ’ S O BSERVATIONS  183 as he tells us himself. He found himself precisely in the condition Madame Blavatsky apparently finds herself tod ay, and where I fear some of the Chelas also are to be found. Like the majority of the Pharisees—which learned sect Paul gloried in following—he acknowledged the glorious Christ, he expected Him, but he did not recognize Him under the appearance of the sorrowful Son of Mary who so little resembled his ideal and that of the Synagogue, with his crown of thorns, his bleeding flesh, with the humiliation of his whole life, with the disconcerting ignominy of his allegedly infamous death. Upon the road to Damascus it was given to Gamaliel’s disciple to discover his glorious Christ in the very person of the Christ veiled in flesh and suffering, in order to realize in his human body all that was ordained by the Law of Sacrifices, in the Cycle of Initiation of which Madame Blavatsky speaks. What was revealed to Paul was not by any means the Christos of the Gnostics, as she says, but really the Chrestos with all the arcana of his abasement and of his annihilation. Also, listen to him on his return from Damascus: “I glorify myself not to know among you any other thing but Jesus Christ, and Jesus-Christ crucified.––Nihil me scire glorior inter vos, nisi Jesum-Christum, et hunc crucifixum. ” * Then, let us say in passing, the Apostle would have taken good care not “to make one mouthful of Saint Peter” as Madame Blavatsky says, because, long before Paul, Peter had deciphered the Arcana of the Passion, and he knew perfectly well that behind the bleeding Christ was hidden, in a kind of chrysalis, the Christ-Spirit, glorious and divine. The proof of this is in the Gospel itself. “What think ye of me?” Christ once asked his disciples. Peter alone answered: “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” “ Credo quia tu es Christus, Filius Dei vivi ”†––“Thou art happy, Simon-Bar-Jona, because thou sayest what has not been revealed to thy spirit by any man, but by the Father only.” Would that Madame Blavatsky could go to Damascus, and on her journey meet what Paul encountered there! In order to become a perfect initiate and the greatest of Christian Buddhists, that alone is lacking. I do not deny that she is better versed in Hindû esotericism than I; but I doubt, after having given it careful consideration, that she is as well acquainted as I am with the Gospel esotericism. This is the reason, due entirely to her, why it is difficult to find ourselves in instant accord. I know Buddhism well enough to understand her easily; she –––––––––– * [The text of the Vu lgate for I Cor ., ii, 2 is: “Non enim judicavi, me scire aliquid inter vos, nisi Jesum Christum, et hunc crucifixum.” —Compiler. ] † [ Matt ., xvi, 16.] –––––––––– 18 4  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" does not know Christianity sufficiently well to readily catch my meaning. Oth erwise, would she have dreamed of displaying so much erudition before me, and to remind me of the astronomical allegory and the sidereal symbolism, in which the priests of the ancient temples saw stereotyped in some fashion all the mysteries of Christianity? It is long since Dr Sepp, to refute Strauss and Dupuis, replied victoriously to the arguments brought against the historic Christ which were drawn from that astral legend. Thus, as that profound exegete remarks, Nature, the real dumb Sibyl, is so full of the Word which informs her that she delivers her oracles and unveils her secrets by means of all the Cosmic manifestations which occur in the subjects treated upon in our sciences; “ multifariam, multisque modis loquens nobis, etc.” To answer Madame Blavatsky on this point, I ought to do some plagiarizing, for I know nothing more definitive than what is written in the Introduction to Dr. Sepp’s splendid Life of Christ, translated into French by M. Charles Sainte-Foi (a pseudonym of Éloi Jourdain). I ask pardon of Madame Blavatsky and her readers for referring her and them to that fine monument of our Gnosis. I have such faith in the progress of critical science that I never despair of anyone—still more of the high intelligences I am addressing at this moment. Let us be content at present with the valuable declaration made by Madame Blavatsky, which is in agreement with her Masters, the Mahâtmas, namely, that behind the dogmatic formulas and sacramental veils of all the exoteric religions there is a supreme, absolute truth, an essentially divine Christianity, however diversely interpreted, and almost everywhere exploited. This alone is enough greatly to astonish our scholars, and especially to make our Church establishments as well as our Academies reflect! Let them work hard with their mattocks everywhere, for the bread of science demands even more sweat than material bread. Yes, Priests, yes, scholars, one and the same Dogma is common to the East and to the West. “Theosophists,” says Madame Blavatsky, “will bring to light the mysteries of the Catholic Church, which are really those of the BrâhmaŠas , although under other names.” So may it be! My first article said enough of h ow I share in that hope, and this one does not contradict it. III.—When Christ’s suffering will have finished the redeeming and liberating work he came to do for us, and which appears to me to be nearing its end; when, thanks to Christian civilization and to the new sciences which are being inaugurated among us, when, I say, by favour of all these illuminations, the humble and suffering Christ “shall have been sufficiently exalted” in the understanding of the people redeemed by his blood, then, according to his own words, “ he will draw all to him, he will bear them to his Father and our Father, to his God and our God, ” and in R EPLY TO M ADAME B LAVATSKY ’ S O BSERVATIONS  185 that ascension he will encompass the whole world: Cu m exaltatus fuero, omnia traham ad meipsum—ascendo ad Deum meum et Deum vestrum, ad Patrem meum et Patrem vestrum .”* Need we comment on this text? As you can see, it would be but to paraphrase the Law of Initiation, such as was formerly practised in the secrecy of the Temples, and such, I believe, as the Mahâtmas and Chelas still practice in their profound and holy retreats. When, by the purifying road of suffering, of expiation, and of death, Christ will be transfigured in the social structure, as he was once personally seen to be upon prophetic Tabor, to the extent that the sorrowful Christ will have become the triumphant Christ, through the sacrifice made to the absolute Ego of all that constitutes the relative Ego or Ego-ism, then, in truth, Son of God as He is from all Eternity, as the Word, equal to and consubstantial with the Father, according to the canonical Nicean expression, he will be recognized, acclaimed, glorified by the East as well as the West; then all the sanctuaries will again re-echo his call, the “general” salute on the drums will again be beaten, and the réveille of his Advent will sound from one end of the earth to the other.

To ra ise this fallen world, sunk lower in the West than in the East—and that is why the earth’s axis is inclined, as you know—a lever was necessary. That lever, far more powerful than the one Archimedes asked for, is the arm of Christ, that arm which we call “the invincible right of the Father.” Under such a process Europe is evolving, is being morally uplifted; it awakens, it thrills, do you not see it? It grows, it mounts, soon it is going to find itself at the heights where Asia stands awaiting it. The Mahâtmas, their gaze fixed on us, have seen this ascensional movement operating in the turmoil of our revolutions, and they are saying to themselves: This is the psychological moment, let us hold out a hand to our poor brothers, and light our beacons in the midst of their darkness. And that is why, obeying the mot-d’ordre of the “Brothers,” you have been able to establish 135 branches, which are so many centres of light, not only in Paris, but already in nearly every quarter of the globe.

These obstacles, these barriers, as everyone understands today, are the political work of Caesar. All our misfortunes come to us from that monster, who is the Satan of whom our Parables speak. Witness Jesus Himself on that point. But first, I must remind you of the cry of triumph that, like a clarion cry of the morning watchman, echoed four years ago in the centre of Paris: “In the twentieth century war will be dead, frontiers will be dead, armies will be dead, Caesars will be dead” and the rest. An immense multitude, assembled at the Château-d’Eau, quivered with enthusiasm under the fiery breath of that prophetic Word, and the echoes sent that emotion far and wide. Shall it be said that Victor Hugo, whose genius was above all made of presentiments and foresight, shall it be said that Paris, France, Europe—Christendom from one end to the other—is nourished on illusions and flatters itself with optimistic dreams? Oh! yes, yes, what is stirring in the entire West and in the whole of America is really the spirit of Christ, you may be sure! Christendom does not realize itself unless it comprehends that it belongs to Christ. “ Mens agitat molem. ” Its Redeemer possessed it, and St. Paul would be socially right in our times: “ Non estis vestri, vos estis Christi. ” * O people, Christ holds you! Upon the Keep of Vincennes, the Pythoness spoke truly when, a hundred and ten years ago, she flung the blazing words to the world by the mouth of Diderot, prisoner of State: “ Deus, ecce Deus !” “Arise, ye peoples, Deliverance is near!” Do you see, Dear Madame, if one wishes to do justice to the system of our Redemption and the genius of its Founder, one must do two things: first, \"not make a question of principles or doctrines into a question of persons or ecclesiastical establishments,\" as one of your brilliant compatriots, Madame Svetchine, said; the Roman Church may no longer find itself at the height of the Holy Gospel, but the Gospel itself has lost nothing of its scientific, religious, and social value, for all that; it may be that the Christian priesthood has fallen, greatly fallen; but its decadence in no way involves that of Catholicism. It would be well to read Rosmini-Serbati in this connection! In the second place, we must bear in mind the deplorable state of the West when our Messiah came to open the Era of our Redemption, at once religious, social, economic, and political. –––––––––– * [The text of the Vu lgate for I Cor ., vi, 19 is as follows: “An nescitis quoniam membra vestra, templum sunt Spiritus sancti qui in vobis est, quem habetis a Dei, et non estis vestri?”— Compiler .] –––––––––– 18 8  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS But who can tell the frightful ravages working in the popular understanding and in the heart of the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Roman world, through the Satanic influence of the Caesarian idea which has ploughed it up for so many centuries? Who can narrate the vices inoculated into Europe by the abominable system of “might makes right” (tyrannizing and brutalizing the peoples, everywhere tied to the soil and riveted by the fetters of more than one kind of slavery), and which were at the heart of all the intellectual, moral and corporeal miseries everywhere, “ erantes et jacentes sicut oves non habentes pastorem, ” as Jesus Christ said.* Although Cain, Irshu, Nimrod, those true fathers of Caesarism, were of Asiatic origin, it was not, however, upon the extreme East but upon the West that the calamities, let loose by those great villains, by those first schismatics from the divine and social Law which had governed all mankind until they arrived, precipitated themselves. The Oriental peoples saw that whirlwind of evils quickly decline toward the horizon and direct its course toward those distant shores which are enclosed by our mountains and seas. Hence it was that some Fathers of the Church remark that Christ, dying on the cross at the extreme limit which separates the West from the East, held his face turned, his eyes open, and his arms extended toward the West. It is to be observed that the statutes of the Law of Ram were not broken then and are not entirely so even yet in Asia, while among us there remains no trace of them, since Julius Caesar stifled the last survivor of it in Druidic Gaul. If rightly understood, we should perhaps notice that the great law of the Abramid temples is exactly that of which the Redeemer spoke: “I am not come to destroy it but to raise it up, to fulfill it” throughout the whole world— Non veni solvere, sed adimplere ! [ Matt ., v, 17]. Madame Blavatsky is too well initiated into the secrets of the primitive sanctuaries to be ignorant, that, long before Jesus Christ, the Hindû peoples had already passed through the social stages which our Messiah came to lead us through in our turn, in order to re-establish the equilibrium between these two great divisions of the human family, so long disrupted. She knows that, before this rupture, the entire world, as witnessed by Moses, had one sole and identical religious language, one sole and identical social constitution: “ Erat terra labii unius, et sermonum eorundem ” [ Gen ., xi, 1]. I am going to say something which not all of my brethren in the priesthood will understand, and that the more illiterate will probably condemn: “The East already had Messiahs and Christs, humanly –––––––––– * [The text of the Vu lgate for I Peter, ii, 25 is as follows: “Eratio enim sicut oves errantes, sed conversi estis nunc ad pastorem, et episcopum animarum vestrarum.”— Compiler .] –––––––––– R EPLY TO M ADAME B LAVATSKY ’ S O BSERVATIONS  189 realized, when the West had only received, through the ministry of Moses and the Prophets, distant promises of its religious and social Redemption.” It is said that “the Jews, thanks to the Legislator of Sinai, found themselves economically at the level of India, when our Messiah came.” That is possible, even probable; but what cannot be doubted is that the Western peoples, ruined by Roman Caesarism, were in a very backward state. Also, notice that while our social evolution, our religious Redemption, and our economic revival will continue, the Jews, the Hindûs, and the Chinese will remain stationary, or if they move at all it will not be forward. They will wait; they are still waiting. And what are they waiting for? I believe I do not deceive myself; they are waiting until we are in a condition to step out at the same pace as themselves; when the hour will strike to resume the march forward toward the Paradesa of Ram to which we shall return with them, hands clasped, with the same triumphant song. And it is in this way that is explained in my mind the failure of the Christian preachings outside the particular sphere that the earliest priesthood of our Church had to evangelize: “preach first the Gospel to the scattered sheep of the house of Israel,” or of Ram (the family of Israel belongs to the Abramite stock and the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"primitive spelling of Abraham is Abram, i.e., Ab-Ram, issue of Ram). Madame Blavatsky enjoys holding Christ and our Church accountable for the impotence of our efforts in the East. She takes that set back as a defeat of Christianity, while, on the contrary, it is the confirmation of the Messianic plan when regarded in its true meaning. With statistics in hand, invoking and confirming the testimony of the venerable Bishop Temple, she observes that “since the beginning of our century, where the Christian missionaries have made but three million converts, the Mohammedans have acquired two million proselytes without the cost of one cent.” “A sign of the times!” she exclaims. Oh, yes! a sign of the times, if one knows how to understand it, an evident sign that our religious economy is peculiar to the West and had but little to do in the East under the preliminary form of our Christian Churches. But wait! Lay aside the idea that it has provided a course of redemption for all the peoples who were ruined and martyred by the Caesarian brigandage. You will see later! You will see how it will spin, that top—our globe—in its entirety, under the whip of the glorious Christ. I could add a large number of observations to the foregoing. I omit here four large pages in the draft that I am transcribing, but I am not closing yet. Let me run through a few points with meticulous care because the ground of argument is going to become a burning question. So long as the work of the Redemption remains with us, the Holy Gospel of the Deliverance will not depart from our Latin, Greek, 1 9 0  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Protestant, Anglican, Anglo-Saxon, and Anglo-American churches; but when, according to the promise of the Lib erator, Christianity will have overthrown and annihilated Caesarism in all its political forms, great things will be seen!* I have promised to let you hear the voice of Christ; this is your opportunity, so listen: “The principle of brutal and criminal force will be driven from the earth.” In other words, which are those of the Gospel: “ Princeps huius mundi ejicietur foras !”† Satan-Caesar will flee from every quarter, his strongholds will be razed, his structures destroyed, his laws abolished. “I have conquered that abominable world: ego vici mundum !”‡ All economic, religious or social establishments not made by my heavenly Father, and whose foundations are not sunk in justice and divine verities, will be uprooted, utterly extirpated: Omnis plantatio, quam non plantavit Pater meus coelestis, eradicabitur !§ From that day, the judgment is given, and the crisis begins: “ Nunc judicium est mundi , <Ø< 6D\\F4l έ F JÂ J@Ø 6`F 9 @L J@bJ@L .” Ha d I space enough at my disposal, I would not merely quote five or ten or a hundred texts.

However, that would only be repeating what I have already published in La Fin de l’Ancien Monde (The End of the Ancient World) and one should not quote oneself. If the priests knew how esoterically to read the dismal parables and funereal prophecies in our Gospel which relate to the end of the world and the consummation of the cycle; if they knew how to understand the symbolism of those mountains that fall, the globe which trembles, the sun which turns black as a coalsack, the moon which no longer reflects light, those constellations which are extinguished, those stars which fall, those trumpets which sound under the breath of Angels, those foundations which are split open, that last judgment which will separate the goats from the sheep . . . they would see that these prodigies are already –––––––––– * [The Editor of Le Lotus, as is fully explained on the first page, is not responsible for the opinions of contributors.

We would not be understood, neither you, Madame, nor I, if we revealed that glorious future now. Madame Blavatsky contradicts me far less than she thinks she does. I withdraw the words Yliaster and Sat which she does not allow, in order to propose that of telesme which was employed by Hermes-Trismegistus. Will she accept that? I doubt it. The fact is, there is no expression in our poor language to denote what I wish to say; but she certainly must have understood me, and that is enough. Outside or beyond God, she accepts nothing, absolutely nothing, not even a mathematical point. She is right. However if one is not a pantheist— and Madame Blavatsky is no more that than I am—one must express oneself in such a way that our readers will not take us for such. To be better understood, let us say, then, that God is immanent in the Cosmos, present through all and in all, but distinct from all. Are you satisfied, Madame? Yes, indeed? Well, so am I. But, really, I do not understand how she can tease me about the triple meaning that we canonically recognize in our Holy Scriptures. The Gnosis, she says, in agreement with the Gupta-Vidyâ, provides seven keys, and not merely three, to open the seven mysteries. Is Madame Blavatsky ignorant of the fact that the Christian Doctrine is essentially ternary in all points in which the Buddhist teaching is septenary? This is not to say that we do not appreciate the real basis of the Oriental system any more than you could misunderstand the real foundation of the Western system. We have simplified and summed up your theory without distorting it. Our three keys are equivalent to your seven and include them, as your seven are equivalent to our three which they subdivide. Everyone knows that the white ray is decomposed into three principal colours which, themselves composite, produce, by a new decomposition, the seven colours of the rainbow. Similarly, analyzing the human being, St. Paul, the true father of our sacred science, describes in him three chief elements which he calls spirit, soul, and body: “ integer spiritus et anima et corpus ”; the Buddhists, being able to analyze man still further, discovered seven principles in him. There is no contradiction in that; you are right and we also: your seven are our three and our three are your seven. Such is our dogma, appropriate to our intellect and our mental categories, less subtle and less penetrating than yours, but also simpler because more rudimentary. We confess and adore in God a unique essence, proceeding in three distinct persons, in three diverse principles of action, and energizing the creature by seven operations which we call the seven manifestations or the seven gifts of the Paraclete. There is in all this something which recalls the seven distinct states of your prajñâ, which answer in their turn to the seven modifications of matter, and to the seven forms or seven classes of the phenomena of force.

Si, ayant l’expérience de tout une longue vie passée à connaître les susdits prêtres, j’ai posé l’éteignoir sur l’espoir couleur de rose dont brillait la flamme de sa première lettre, c’est que je ne saurais prendre au sérieux de simples compliments de politesse d’un abbé chrétien et français à l’adresse des Mahatmas payens, et que, si la Direction du Lotus français a pu se tromper, la directrice du Lucifer anglais y a vu clair.* Tout en appréciant sincèrement M. l’abbé Roca comme homme écrivain, tout en séparant dans ma pensée le philosophe mystique du prêtre, je ne pouvais cependant pas perdre de vue sa soutane. Donc, l’hommage rendu par lui au savoir de nos maîtres, au lieu de m ’ enivrer de son fumet, m’était apparu dès le premier instant sous son vrai symbolisme. Cet «hommage» y jouait le rôle d’un mât de cocagne, érigé pour servir de support aux brimborions chrétiens qu’une main apostolique et romaine y attachait à profusion, ou de poupée indo-théosophique qu’elle affublait d’amulettes papistes.† Et, loin d’être enivrée— je le confesse avec ma «franchise» et ma rudesse ordinaires comme sans ambages— je ne sentis qu’un redoublement de mefiance.

Il a le droit certainement; mieux que personne, il doit connaître le fond de sa pensée. Mais il en est ainsi pour tout le monde, je pense. Pourquoi alors va-t-il dénaturer ce que je dis, et même inventer des cas et des scènes impossibles où il me fait jouer un rôle étrange et m’attribue des paroles qu’il n’a certes pas trouvées dans mes «Notes» en réponse à son article du mois de décembre? L’idée fondamentale de mes observations était, en effet, que celui qui voudra dire « Ego sum veritas » est encore à naître; que le « Vos Dii estis » s’applique à tous, et que tout homme né d’une femme est «le fils de Dieu»––qu’il soit bon, mauvais ou ni l’un ni l’autre. Ou M. l’abbé Roca s’obstine à ne pas me comprendre, ou il poursuit un but. Je ne m’oppose pas du tout à ce qu’il prenne la voix foudroyante de son Église latine pour celle qu’il croit entendre dans le fond de son âme , mais je m’oppose formellement à ce qu’il me représente comme partageant les dogmes qui lui sont ainsi inculqués, lorsque je les répudie complètement. Jugez un peu. J’écris en toutes lettres qu’un Christ (ou Christos ) divin n’a jamais existé sous une forme humaine ailleurs que dans l’imagination des blasphémateurs qui ont carnalisé un principe universel et tout impersonnel. J’ose croire que c’est fort clair. Eh bien, l’abbé Roca, après m’avoir représentée disant: la vérité, c’est moi—absurdité que je laisse aux Églises qui l’ont trouvée et dont un Adepte, un Sage rirait de pitié—se laisse aller à l’assertion suivante: «Il se rencontre qu’avant M me Blavatsky quelqu’un s’est présenté au monde qui a dit ca rrément: ‘ La V ÉRITÉ , c’est moi,— Eg o sum Veritas! ’ Ce langage est du Christ, et s’il ne révélait pas Dieu lui-même il trahirait le plus effronté des imposteurs.

Ou bien M me Blavatsky pa ssera sous silence cette assertion aussi extraordinaire que fausse et alors—qui ne dit mot consent, ou bien elle y répondra pour la contredire et la nier; et dans ce dernier cas elle se fera de nouveaux ennemis parmi les chrétiens, et c’est autant de gagné. Est-ce cela, Monsieur l’abbé? Alors, c’est un faux calcul de plus. L’ «amazone» aura cette fois, comme les autres du reste, assez de «mâle vigueur» pour répondre sans ambages et à la face de l’univers ce qu’elle pense de votre petit arrangement. En effet, dire que le Christ (nous disons Christos ) est imposteur, ce serait proférer non pas un blasphème mais une simple stupidité: un adjectifpersonnel ne peut s’appliquer à un principe idéal, à une abstraction; ce serait comme si l’on disait: «l’espace infini est un dévot». Un théosophe occultiste rirait. Quant à la supposition que je suis capable de répliquer «par une maîtresse gifle» sur la bouche de celui qui proférerait la phrase, elle est encore plus baroque. Monsieur l’abbé oublie que je suis théosophe d’abord, et ignore probablement que je suis personnellement disciple de la philosophie bouddhiste. Or un vrai bouddhiste ne donnerait pas même une tape à un chien pour l’empêcher d’aboyer. Les bouddhistes pratiquent toutes les vertus prêchées dans le «Sermon sur la Montagne» de Gayâ—sur la montagne de Galilée six siècles plus tard—vertus dont on n’entend guère parler dans les églises des pays chrétiens et qu’on y met encore moins en pratique.

Pour moi, Jésus-Christ, c’est-à-dire l’Homme-Dieu des chrétiens, copie des Avatars de tous les pays, du Chrishna indou comme de l’Horus égyptien, n’a jamais été un personnage historique. C’est une personnification déifiée du type glorifié des grands Hiérophantes des Temples,* et son histoire racontée dans le Nouveau Testament est une allégorie, contenant certainement de profondes vérités ésotériques, mais c’est une allégorie. Elle s’interprète à l’aide des sept clefs de même que le Pentateuque. Cette théorie des sept clefs, l’Église, d’après l’abbé Roca, l’aurait simplifiée et résumée en trois «sans la dénaturer», alors qu’au contraire elle a fabriqué trois f`ausses clefs qui n’ouvrent rien du tout.

Et si l’on contredit ce fait—ce à quoi je ne m’oppose guère—il faudra en prendre son parti et regarder le héros du drame du Calvaire comme un mythe pur et simple. En effet, malgré toutes les recherches désespérées faites pendant de longs siècles, si on laisse de côté le témoignage des «Evangélistes», c’est-à-dire d’hommes inconnus dont l’identité ne fut jamais établie, et celle des Pères de l’Église, fanatiques intéressés, ni l’historre, ni la tradition profane, ni les documents officiels, ni les contemporains du soidisant drame, n’ont pu fournir une seule preuve sérieuse de l’existence réelle et historique, non seulement de l’Homme-Dieu mais même du nommé Jésus de Nazareth, depuis l’an 1 jusqu’à l’année 33. Tout est ténèbre et silence. Philon de Judée, né avant l’ère chrétienne et mort longtemps après l’année où, d’après Renan, l’hallucination d’une hystérique, Marie de Magdala, donne un Dieu au monde, Philon fit dans cet intervalle de quarante et quelques années plusieurs voyages àJérusalem. n y alla pour écrire l’histoire des sectes religieuses de la Palestine à son époque. Il n’est pas d’écrivain plus correct dans ses recits, plus soucieux de ne rien omettre: aucune communauté, aucune fraternité, fût-elle la plus insignifiante, ne lui échappe. Pourquoi donc ne parle-t-il pas des Nazaréens? Pourquoi ne fait-il pas la plus lointaine allusion aux Apôtres, au Galiléen divin , à la Crucification? La réponse est facile. Parce que la biographie de Jésus fut inventée après le premier siècle et que personne, à Jérusalem n’était plus renseigné que Philon sur ce sujet. On n’a qu’a lire la querelle d’Irénée avec les gnostiques, au IIe siècle, pour s’en assurer. Ptolémée (l’an 180) ayant fait remarquer que Jésus ne prêcha qu’ un an au dire de la légende, et qu’il était trop jeune pour avoir pu enseigner quelque chose d’important, Irénée a un bel accès d’indignation et certifie que Jésus prêcha plus de dix et même de vingt ans ! La tradition seule, dit-il, parle de dix ans (lib. II, c.22, pp.4, 5). Ailleurs, il fait mourir Jésus âgé de plus de R ÉPONSE A UX F AUSSES C ONCEPTIONS  205 cinquante ans !!

Confusion, mensonges, fourberies et faux, voilà le bilan des premiers siècles. Eusèbe de Césarée, le roi des falsificateurs, insère les fameuses 16 lignes touchant Jésus, dans un manuscrit de Josèphe, pour donner le change aux gnostiques qui niaient qu’il y eût jamais eu un personnage réel du nom de Jésus.* Plus encore: il attribue à Josèphe, un fanatique mort comme il avait vécu, en Juif obstiné, la réflexion qu’il n’est peut-être pas juste de l’appe]er (lui, Iasous) un homme ( \"<ZD ), car il était l’ Oint du Seigneur, c’est-à-dire le Messie!! (Voyez Josèphe, Antiq., lib. XVIII, cap. iii, 3.) Mais à quoi bon perdre son temps à redire des choses que tout homme bien élevé connaît. Monsieur l’abbé nous renvoie, à tout moment, aux Évangiles et à saint Paul, et, faisant pleuvoir un torrent de citations, il demande triomphalement: «Est-ce assez clair? Le Christ ne dit-il pas lui-même ceci et cela, et saint Paul ne nous assure-t-il pas que. . ., etc., etc». Inutile de dire que pour que les paroles de Jésus obtiennent quelque valeur comme preuve, il faut d’abord que l’authenticité des Évangiles soit prouvée. Jésus, qu’il ait vécu à cette époque ou auparavant, n ’ a rien écrit, et ce qu’on lui fait dire dans les quatre Évangiles est parfois terriblement contradictoire. Quant à Paul, personnage historique certainement, il serait difficile de se retrouver au milieu de ce qu’il dit lui-même et de ce que ses éditeurs et correcteurs lui font dire.

Cet idéal n’est pas chrétien, et ce ne sont pas les Mahatmas non plus qui l’ont inventé: c ’ était l ’ Apothéose des Mystères de l ’ Initiation. Quant au «Verbe fait chair», c’est l’héritage de l’humanité entière, reçu par l’homme le jour où l’Ame universelle s’incarna en lui, c’est-à-dire depuis l’apparition du premier homme parfait— qui, entre parenthèses, n’est pas Adam. Pour prouver queJésus était Dieu, on nous présente son martyre sur la Croix et son sacrifice volontaire. Avant de croire à un «maître» l’égal du «Christ», il faudrait qu’il consentit à boire le calice que Jésus but à Gethsémani et pardonnât à ses bourreaux ses tortures physiques et morales.

Saint Paul, selon M. l’abbé Roca, était «un initié de l’école essénienne de Gamaliel, un vrai Thérapeute, un parfait Nazaréen, comme il nous l’apprend lui-même» (p. 261). Je le remercie de ces renseignements, mais je regrette de ne pouvoir les accepter. Un Essénien Nazareen équivaudrait à un brahme-bouddhiste; bien que nous ayons ouï parler d’un «brahme, prêtre bouddhiste», créature hybride qui aurait habité Paris jadis! Paul, quel qu’il fût ne pouvait être à la fois essénien et nazaréen, si par na-zaréen M. l’abbé entend la secte des Nazars de l’Ancient Testament dont la Genèse même fait mention. Les Esséniens avaient en horreur l’huile et le vin, tandis que les Nazars usaient des deux (Voir les Nombres, vi, 20). Les premiers ne reconnaissaient pas les « oints du Seigneur» et se servaient d’eau pour se laver plusieurs fois par jour, comme les Indous et les Bouddhistes; les Nazars, s’étant oints d’huile tout le corps, ne se lavaient jamais. Il est vrai que Paul nous dit dans l’ Épitre aux Galatéens (i, 15 et seq.) qu’il avait été « séparé » pour le service du Seigneur dès sa naissance, c’est-à-dire voué au nazariat; mais comme il dit ailleurs ( I Corinth., xi,14), que c’est une honte de porter les cheveux longs (ainsi qu’on représente Jésus et saint –––––––––– *Je renvoie M. l’abbé aux récits de ce que M.Jacolliot a vu aux Indes, et que tous ceux qui y ont vécu ont p u voir tous les jours.

Jean-Baptiste était un vrai nazar, ainsi que Jean de l’ Apocalypse, mais Saul cesse de l’être en devenant Paul. Donc, il n’était pas «un parfait Nazaréen». Il n’était pas non plus un Essénien, car ce que ceux-ci avaient de plus sacré après Dieu, c’était Moïse, sa Genèse, l’observation du Sabbat, et Paul avait renoncé à Moïse et au Sabbat. Que faire? M. l’abbé nous dit une chose, et l’histoire avec les deux Testaments, une tout autre chose. Il est donc inutile de venir dire à des occultistes que «ce qui fut révélé à Paul, ce n’est donc pas du tout le Christos des Gnostiques mais bien le Chrestos avec tous les arcanes de son abaissement et de son anéantissement». Ce Chrestos est justement le Chrestos-Christos des Gnostiques. Paul n’a jamais été un apôtre du christianisme ecclésiastique, étant l’adversaire gnostique de Pierre.

P. B LAVATSKY [ Le Lotus, Paris, Vol. II, No. 13, April, 1888, pp. 3-19] [ Translation of the foregoing original French text. ] In the February issue of Le Lotus, the Abbé speaks of a “drubbing” [ bo urrade ] which he believes he received from me. At the same time, with a meekness which I will not call Christian—because the Christians are neither humble nor gentle in their polemics—but certainly Buddhistic, my interlocutor assures me that he bears me no ill-will. On the contrary, he says he is gratified by “my courteous manner and the complete frankness of my language,” quite natural results of my “Amazonian gait.” A more cavilling mind than mine could find something to say to that. It would point out, perhaps, that such a superabundance of adjectives and personal epithets, in reply to observations on a subject as abstract as religious metaphysics, denotes quite the opposite of satisfaction. But Theosophists are but seldom flattered by their critics, and I myself have often received compliments more ill-turned than those the Abbé Roca lavishes on me. I should be wrong, therefore, not to appreciate his courtesy, especially since in his touching solicitude in considering my personality, and in order to do justice to my “virile intellect” and to my “masculine vigour,” the Abbé has consigned the theological Christ to the background and has not breathed a word about the esoteric Christ. Now, as I have nothing to say of the first, and as I deny in toto the Christ invented by the Church, as well as all the doctrines, all the interpretations, and all the dogmas, ancient and modern, concerning that personage, I begin by declaring the Reply of the Abbé to my “Notes on R EPLY TO THE M ISTAKEN C ONCEPTIONS  217 Ch ristian Esotericism” to be no answer at all. I do not find, in all his voluminous letter, one"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"single expression that would seriously contradict my objections, by refuting them logically and scientifically. Faith—and above all blind faith—cannot be “critically discussed”; in any case it can never be “scientifically established,” even though the Christian reader may be well satisfied with such casuistry. My interlocutor even bears me a grudge for having “displayed” what he pleases to call “such erudition.” That goes without saying. Against historical and valid arguments, he can offer as an objection only one single fact as “experimental” proof: Jesus Christ unceasingly telling him in his soul “that he is the Unique Master and the only true Doctor.” A feeble proof, indeed, in the face of science, law, and even the common sense of an unbeliever! It is obvious that the famous paradox of Tertullian: “ Credo quia absurdum et impossibile est ” * has nothing to do with a discussion of this kind. I thought I was addressing myself to the erudite mystic, to the socialistic and liberal Abbé Roca. Have I disturbed myself merely for a priest, a fidei defensor ! The Abbé gets out of it by saying: “I know Buddhism well enough to understand her [me] easily; she does not know Christianity sufficiently well to readily catch my meaning.” Grieved as I am to contradict him, truth must nevertheless come before all else. The Abbé deceives himself in fancying he understands Buddhism; it is easy to see that he does not know it even exoterically, any more than Hinduism, even in its popular form. Otherwise would he have ever placed Krishna, as he does on page 259, among the Buddhas? Or again, would he have confused the name of a historical personage, Prince Gautama, with his mystical titles, enumerating them as so many Buddhas? Does he not write, indeed, in speaking of Jesus, that the chalice from which he drank was “far more bitter than the cup from which Socrates in the West drank the hemlock, or –––––––––– * [This is the often misquoted sentence from Tertullian’s Ca rne Christi, ch. v, which runs: “ Certum est quia impossibile est, ” meaning “it is certain because it is impossible.”— Compiler .] –––––––––– 21 8  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS th at . . . . which K \u0001 ishŠa, ®âkyamuni,* Gautama of Kapilavastu, Siddhârtha, and all the other Buddhas ” had drained? This “and all the other Buddhas” is a definite proof for us that the Abbé not only knows nothing of esoteric Buddhism, but has not the slightest idea of even the simple historical and popular biography of the great Hindu reformer. This is exactly as if, in speaking of Jesus, I should write: “Orpheus, the Son of Mary, Emmanuel, the Saviour, the Nazarene, and all the other Christs who have been crucified.” Without further wasting time in pointing out a number of lapsus linguae relating to Sanskrit, Brâhmanical and Buddhist terms scattered throughout the articles of the Abbé Roca—otherwise very learned articles and certainly very eloquent in style—that example is sufficient to permit the public to judge if my critic knows the first word of Buddhism in the present discussion.

Should one not say rather (admitting for the moment that I have not been able “to catch at once” the Christianity of the Abbé Roca ) that my esteemed interlocutor is not too well aware of what he preaches? That, having thrown to the windmills his cap of an orthodox and papistical ecclesiastic, ignoring the true esotericism of the Brâhmanas and the Buddhists, of the Pagan and Christian Gnostics, as well as of the authentic Chaldean Kabalah, and knowing nothing of the doctrines of the Theosophists, he has fabricated for himself a Christianity of his own, an Esotericism sui generis ?

À propos of this, I would say he must be very thin-skinned, as I do not see, in my “Notes on Christian Esotericism,” anything that could have given rise to such an idea in the imagination of my honorable interlocutor. The puff of wind which knocks down a house of cards may easily pass for a heavy squall in the eyes of the architect who built it; but if the Abbé Roca lays the blame on the puff, rather than on the weakness of his edifice, it is certainly not my fault. He also accuses me of partisanship; that is an accusation as unjust as the other. As I am neither a priest nor under the ferocious rod of a Church which declares itself infallible, I , myself, am ready to accept the truth from whence it comes. My critic, less fortunate than myself, finding himself between the hammer and the anvil, cannot accept my conclusions, and forthwith tries to attribute them to my “partisanship,” and my “ignorance” of his religion. Once again, the spirit of partisanship cannot exist in a Society as universal and impartial as ours, which has chosen for its motto “There is no religion higher than Truth.” Our Masters being Sages far too great to bedizen themselves with the peacock’s feathers of infallibility or even to boast of the possession of absolute Truth, their disciples always keep an open mind to facts which can be demonstrated to them.

Very good; then let him give us proofs, irrefutable or at least as logical and evident as those advanced by us. But he must not come offering as proof the voice which speaks in his soul, or quotations drawn from the Gospels. Because his voice—were it even the twin-sister of that of the daïmôn of Socrates—has no more value in the discussion, for us or for the public, than has for him or for any other person, the voice which tells me to the contrary in my soul. Yes, he is right in saying that “it is so difficult to rid oneself of all personal interest, and, still more, of all partisanship of school, sect, church, caste”; as that sentence could in no way apply to me, for I do not hold to any special school nor belong to any sect, Church or caste, since I am a Theosophist , would it not apply to him, Christian, Catholic, Ecclesiastic and Canon? In general, our esteemed correspondent must have a rather lively imagination. For now he imagines the Editor of Le Lotus “intoxicated by the heady fumes” of his eulogies of the knowledge of the Mahâtmans and “nodding and winking” at him. If so, the Editor must be “melancholy in his cups” since, instead of thanking him for his flattering advances (flattering, according to him), the Editor sends the Abbé’s first article to me in London, so that I may answer it, and follows it by my “thrashing.” Our facts and intentions do not agree with the ideas the Abbé Roca has of them. It is true that he has warned his readers that “no one would suspect this lady [his humble servant] of toadyism in respect to Catholic priests.” That is an incontestable and historical fact; it is indeed the only one I find in his long epistle. If, having the experience of a long life passed in studying the above-mentioned priests, I have put an extinguisher on the rosy hopes which shone in the flame of his first letter, it is because I could not take seriously the simple compliments of civility addressed to the pagan Mahâtmans by a Christian and a French Abbé, and because, even if the Editor of the French Lotus could be 222  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS de ceived, the Editor of the English Lucifer had seen through them.* While sincerely appreciating the Abbé Roca as a writer, and while in my thoughts distinguishing the mystical philosopher from the priest, I cannot, however, lose sight of his cassock. So the homage he renders to the wisdom of our Masters, instead of intoxicating me by its heady fumes, immediately appeared to me under its true guise. This homage plays the part of a greasy pole erected to serve as a support for Christian gewgaws attached to it in profusion, by an apostolic and Roman hand, or of a Hindu-Theosophic doll bedecked with Popish amulets. † Far from being intoxicated —I confess with my usual “frankness” and my unambiguous rudeness —I feel but a redoubled mistrust. The misconceptions with which the Abbé’s Reply abounds prove how right I was. Did he expect the Editor of Le Lotus and the Theosophists to cry out in chorus: Mea culpa ! and be converted en masse to his ideas?

The fundamental idea of my observations was in fact that he who would say “ Ego sum veritas ” is yet to be born; that the “ Vos Dii estis ” applies to all, and that every man born of woman is “the son of God,” whether he be good, bad, or neither the one nor the other. Either the Abbé Roca is obstinately determined not to understand me, or he has an ulterior purpose. I do not at all object to his mistaking the thundering voice of his Latin Church for the one he thinks he hears in the depth of his soul , but I do most emphatically object to his representing me as sharing the dogmas which have been thus inculcated in him, when in reality I repudiate them completely. Judge for yourself. I write in every letter that a divine Christ (or Christos ) has never existed under a human form outside the imagination of blasphemers who have carnalized a universal and entirely impersonal principle . I venture to believe that this is perfectly clear. Well, the Abbé Roca, after having represented me as saying “I am the Truth”—an absurdity I leave to the Churches who discovered it, and at which an Adept, a Sage, would smile in pity—allows himself to make the following assertion: . . . . . it happens that another presented himself to the world who said squarely, “I am the TRUTH–– Ego sum V e ritas ”! . . . . That is the language of Christ, and if it did not reveal God Himself, it would betray him as the most shameless of impostors. Now to say in the presence of Madame Blavatsky that Christ is an impostor should be carefully avoided, because she would reply with an outright smack on the mouth of the blasphemer. Draw your own conclusions then. . . . Draw your own conclusions!!!. . . Wh at conclusions may or may not be drawn by others interests me very little. But I will draw my own conclusions, for, I believe, I understand. There are two possibilities:"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"a . Either the Abbé has no clear idea of what Theosophy is, of its real doctrines, or of myself, the humble disciple of Truth, and speaks to the winds and at random; 224  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS b . O r he wants to corner me, to force me to explain myself, so as to get a categorical answer from me. The reasoning would not be bad. Either Madame Blavatsky will pass in silence that assertion which is as extraordinary as it is false—silence means consent or she will reply by contradicting and denying it; in the latter case she will make fresh enemies among the Christians, and that would be so much gained. Is that so, Monsieur l’Abbé? Then it is just one more miscalculation. The “amazon” will have this time, as well as on other occasions, enough “masculine vigour” to reply without ambiguity and in the very face of the universe, what she thinks of your little arrangement. In fact, to say that Christ (we say Christos ) is an impostor would be to proffer, not a blasphemy, but a simple stupidity: a personal adjective cannot be applied to an ideal principle, to an abstraction; it would be like saying: “Infinite Space is a devotee.” An Occultist-Theosophist would laugh. As to the supposition that I am capable of replying “with an outright smack” on the mouth of the one who would proffer the expression, that is still more grotesque. The Abbé forgets that I am first of all a Theosophist, and is probably ignorant that I am personally a disciple of the Buddhist philosophy. Now a true Buddhist would not even strike a dog to stop him from barking. The Buddhists practice all the virtues preached in the “Sermon on the Mount” of Gayâ––on the Mount of Galilee six centuries later—virtues which are heard of but rarely in the churches of the Christian countries, and that are practised still less frequently. The Buddhists do not resist, they do not return evil for evil; they leave the glory of smacking, of cutting off the ears of their adversaries, to those like saint Peter who in that way defend their Master, only to betray and deny him two hours later, according to the sad story. Does the Abbé wish to know, without ambiguity, what I really think of the Christian legend ? It is easy for me to satisfy him. For me Jesus Christ, i.e., the Man-God of the Christians, copied from the Avatâras of every country, from the Hindu K \u0001 ishŠa as well as the Egyptian Horus, was never a R EPLY TO THE M ISTAKEN C ONCEPTIONS  225 hi storical person. He is a deified personification of the glorified type of the great Hierophants of the Temples,* and his story, as told in the New Testament, is an allegory, assuredly containing profound esoteric truths, but still an allegory. It is interpreted by the help of the seven keys, similarly to the Pentateuch. This theory of the seven keys, the"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Church, according to the Abbé Roca, has simplified “without disfiguring it,” reducing the keys to three; while, on the contrary, it has fabricated three false keys which do not open anything.

As a matter of fact, in spite of all the desperate research made during long centuries, if we set aside the testimony of the “Evangelists,” i.e., unknown men whose identity has never been established, and that of the Fathers of the Church, interested fanatics, neither history, nor profane tradition, neither official documents, nor the contemporaries of the soi-disant drama, are able to provide one single serious proof of the historical and real existence, not only of the Man-God but even of him called Jesus of Nazareth, from the year 1 to the year 33. All is darkness and silence. Philo Judaeus, born before the Christian Era, and dying quite some time after the year when, according to Renan, the hallucination of a hysterical woman, Mary of Magdala, gave a God to the world, made several journeys to Jerusalem during that interval of forty-odd years. He went there to write the history of the religious sects of his epoch in Palestine. No writer is more correct in his descriptions, more careful to omit nothing; no community, no fraternity, even the most insignificant, escaped him. Why then does he not speak of the Nazarites? Why does he not make the least allusion to the Apostles, to the divine Galilean, to the Crucifixion? The answer is easy. Because the biography of Jesus was invented after the first century, and no one in Jerusalem was better informed on the subject than Philo himself. We have but to read the quarrel of Irenaeus with the Gnostics in the 2nd century, to be certain of it. Ptolemaeus (180 A.D .), having remarked that Jesus preached one year according to the legend, and that he was too young to have been able to teach anything of importance, Irenaeus had a bad fit of indignation and testified that Jesus preached more than ten or even twenty years ! Tradition alone, he said, speaks of ten years ( Contra Haereses, lib. II, cap. 22, para. 4-5). Elsewhere, he makes Jesus die at the age of fifty years or more !! Now, if as early as the year 180, a Father of the Church had recourse to tradition, and if no R EPLY TO THE M ISTAKEN C ONCEPTIONS  227 one was sure of anything, and no great importance was attributed to the Gospels—to the Logia of which there were more than sixty—what place has history in all of this?

Eusebius of"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Caesarea, king of falsifiers, inserted the famous 16 lines referring to Jesus in a manuscript of Josephus, to get even with the Gnostics who denied that there ever had been a real personage named Jesus.* Still more: he attributed to Josephus, a fanatic who died as he had lived, a stubborn Jew, the reflection that it is perhaps not correct to call him (Iasous) a man ( \"<ZD ), because he was the Lord’s Anointed, i.e., the Messiah!! ( Vid e Josephus, Antiq., lib. XVIII, cap. iii, 3.)† But what use is it to waste time repeating what every well-educated man knows. The Abbé continually refers us to the Gospels and to St. Paul, and, showering on us a torrent of quotations, triumphantly demands: “Is this clear enough? Did not Christ himself say this and that, and does not St. Paul assure us that. . . etc., etc., . . .” It is hardly necessary to say that for the words of Jesus to possess any value as proof, the authenticity of the Gospels must first be proved. Jesus, whether he lived at that epoch or earlier, never wrote anything, and what he has been made to say in the four Gospels is sometimes terribly contradictory. As to Paul, undoubtedly a historical personage, it would be difficult to separate, in his writings, what he said himself and what his editors and correctors have made him say. However, there remains—doubtless by inadvertence—one expression, by him or by his collaborators, which sums up in two words what was thought about Jesus. Look up the Epistle to the Hebrews, ii, 9; you will read there that Jesus was made “ inferior to the angels. ” That is enough for us. –––––––––– * Add to this that he invented the famous monogram for the L a barum of Constantine (a combination of X Chi, and P Rho, initials of Christos which he applied to Jesus) and fabricated the vision of that Emperor.

Indeed, every man, every Ju-su (name of Horus, Khonsu, the Son, the type of humanity), above all, every initiate whose body is made inferior to that of the angels, can say, in the presence of his Âtman (Divine Spirit): Vivit vero in me Christus, as he would say: Krishna, Buddha, or Ormuzd lives in me.* After having repeated what I said in my “Notes” about the Christos developing only through the Chrestos, the Abbé, as if he were saying something new which emanated from him, exclaims in threatening tone that no one will enter into that glorified body except by the “strait gate and narrow way.” For him, this is the blessed NirvâŠa , and he continues to preach what we have been preaching for twelve years and what I repeated in my “Notes.” He must let me complete what he leaves in such fine shape, unable to find that path except in the bosom of his Church, of his own faith.

So I prefer by far to remain the humblest of esoteric Buddhists than the greatest of orthodox and exoteric Christians. I have the most profound respect for the transcendental idea of the universal Christos (or Christ) which lives in the soul of the Bushman and the savage Zulu, as well as in that of the Abbé Roca, but I have the keenest aversion for the Christolatry of the Churches. I hate those dogmas and doctrines which have degraded the ideal Christos by making of it an absurd and grotesque anthropomorphic fetish, a jealous and cruel idol which damns for eternity those who decline to bow down before it.* The least of the Gnostic Docetae –––––––––– * It is so much the easier for me to prove the solid foundation of my repugnance, since in order to s u pport my statements, I have merely to open The Tablet, the leading organ of the English Roman Catholics. Here is an excerpt from it: “The official statement as to the moral and material progress of India which has recently been published, supplies a very interesting contribution to the controversy on the missionary question. It appears from these figures that while we effect a very marked moral deterioration in the natives by converting them to our creed, their natural standard of morality is so high that, however much we Christianize them, we cannot succeed in making them altogether as bad as ourselves. The figures representing the proportions of criminality in the several classes, are as follows:—Europeans, I in 274; Eurasians, 1 in 509; Native Christians, I in 799; Mohammedans, I in 856; Hindus, 1 in 1361; and Buddhists, 1 in 3787.

As to the “Word made Flesh,” it is the heritage of the whole of humanity, received by man the moment the universal Soul incarnated in him, i.e., from the appearance of the first perfect man— who, by the way, was not Adam. By way of proving that Jesus was God, we are offered his martyrdom on the Cross and his voluntary sacrifice. Before believing a “Master” the equal of “Christ,” he should have to agree to drink from the chalice that Jesus drained at Gethsemane and to pardon his executioners for his moral and physical tortures. A strange idea, truly! But it is exactly the insignificance of those sufferings that makes every pagan smile in pity. What are three years of sermons and of living in the open, ended by a few hours of suffering on the cross, compared with the eighty years of moral torture of Gautama the Buddha, before which all the tortures of the flesh fade into insignificance! Ah, Monsieur l’Abbé, it is more difficult, more meritorious and more divine, to live voluntarily for Humanity than to die for it. And how?

Are you going"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"to interest a yogi or a fanatical fakir in those sufferings if you interpret them to him literally ! * Being assured that I have not understood it , I am instructed in the true meaning of the conversion of (saint) Paul. Saint Paul, according to the Abbé Roca, was “an initiate of the Essenian School . . . . a perfect Nazarite, as he tells us himself” (p. 261). I thank him for this information, but regret being unable to accept it. A Nazarite-Essene would be the equivalent of a Brâhman-Buddhist; albeit we have heard a hybrid creature said formerly to have lived in Paris, spoken of as a “Brâhman-Buddhist priest”! Paul, whatever he might have been, could not have been at the same time an Essene and a Nazarite, if by Nazarite is meant the Nazar sect of the Old Testament, mentioned even in Genesis. The Essenes had a horror of oil and wine, while the Nazars made use of both (see Numbers , vi, 20). The former did not recognize the “ anointed of the Lord” and used water to wash themselves several times daily, like the Hindus and Buddhists; the Nazars never washed but anointed themselves all over with oil. It is true that Paul tells us in the Epistle to the Galatians (i, 15 et seq .) that he had been “ separated ” for the Lord’s service from his birth: i.e., pledged to the nazarship; but, as he says elsewhere ( I Cor ., xi , 14) that it is a shame to wear long hair (as Jesus and St. John are represented as doing), –––––––––– * I refer the Abbé to the accounts of what Monsieur Jacolliot saw in India, and which all w ho have lived th e re could see at any time. Consider those fanatical yogis who, at each new moon, hang themselves by the skin of the back to an iron hook fixed at the end of a horizontal branch on the top of a high post. This arm, like a see-saw, lifts them high in the air and makes them twirl round till the bleeding flesh breaks away and the voluntary martyr is hurled perhaps twenty paces. Look at those who, for long years, burn their bodies over hot coals every day, and those w ho bury themselves to the neck and remain thus all their lives exposed to the blazing sun, the cold of freezing nights, the myriads of insects and savage beasts, not to mention hunger and thirst and other delights of that kind. –––––––––– 23 2  BL AVATSKY: CO LLECTED WR ITINGS th is proves that he remained a Nazar * only until his conversion to the Christos of the Gnostics. John the Baptist was a real Nazar, also John of the Apocalypse, but Saul ceased to be so when he became Paul. So then, he was not a “perfect Nazarite.” He was no longer an Essene either, because what they held as most sacred after God was Moses, his Genesis, and the observance of the Sabbath, and Paul had renounced Moses and the Sabbath. What are we to do? The Abbé tells us one thing, and history with both Testaments, quite another. So it is quite useless to tell the occultists that “what was revealed to Paul was not by any means the Christos of the Gnostics . . . . but really the Chrestos with all the arcana of his abasement and of his annihilation.” This Chrestos is exactly the Chrestos-Christos of the Gnostics. Paul was never an apostle of ecclesiastical Christianity, being the Gnostic adversary of Peter. As proof of this fact we have the authentic words of Paul, which were overlooked in the revision and correction, and the double meaning, that disharmony which"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"runs through the Epistles. If two men are in possession, I will not say of the absolute truth but of a fact established by evidence, in other words, of a relative truth, why does the one say of the other that he withstood him to his face ( Gal., ii, 11), and why does Paul show such contempt for the claim of Peter (Cephas), James and John to be considered as “pillars of the Church”? It is equally useless to refer me to Dr. Sepp and his Life of Christ.

I will mention but one.* Every Theosophist knows of the great period of Mahâ-yuga whose divisions always lead us back to the figure 432. Thus Kali-yuga †––the black and evil age of the BrâhmaŠas , during which the world expiates the sins of the three preceding yugas and to whose help no Avatâra will come before its close ‡—will last 432,000 years, while the total of the Mahâ-yuga , made up of the Satya , Tretâ , Dwâpara and Kali-Yugas makes 4,320,000 years.

In Volume I (p. 9) of his book, he gives us the following key: “It is an asserted fact [by Kepler] that at the moment of the incarnation, all the planets were in conjunction in the sign of the Fishes which the Jews called, from the beginning of things, the constellation of the Messiah.

As to Dr. Sepp, he claims that in virtue of these natural prophecies it was written in the stars that the Messiah had to appear in the lunar year of the world 4320, in that memorable year when the “whole choir of planets was in jubilee.” * Thus, to admit Dr. Sepp’s whimsical notions published in his “fine monument to the Christian Gnosis,” we must, while closing our eyes and compressing our brains: (1) Believe that the world is only six thousand years old—not a day more. (Long live Genesis and the Chronology of Moses!) (2) Assume that this famous conjunction took place in the year 1 of our era, and not four or five years before the Christian era as Kepler himself proved. 3) Forget what we know in order to allow the miraculous fantasies of the ecclesiastics to be triumphant. Now, we know that this astronomical calculation was borrowed by the Jews from the Chaldeans, from their 432,000 dynastic years, which they themselves had received from the 4,320,000 years of the Brâhmanical Mahâ-yuga. And we should have to accept that fine passage “of the gnosis” from Bavaria! We would be inclined to believe that Dr. Sepp had found it at the bottom of a pot of beer, did we not know that long before him Col. Wilford, who was so nicely tricked by the BrâhmaŠas † at the beginning of this century, had himself made the famous calculation, preserved to this day, by the way, in the volumes of the Royal Asiatic Society’s Library in Calcutta, and in all the European libraries.

In my Notes I shall explain everything, except the assertion that the Crucified, whose hands were restrained by two big nails to the two lateral arms of the cross, had “his arms extended towards the West,” a feat difficult to be performed by a “crucified one.” But that is an insignificant detail.

Adam Kadmon is no man, but the protologos, the collective Sephirothal Tree—the “Heavenly Man,” the vehicle (or Vahan) used by En-Soph to manifest in the phenomenal world (see Zohar ); and as the “male and female” Adam is the “Archetypal man,” so the animals mentioned in the first chapter are the sacred animals, or the zodiacal signs, while “Light” refers to the angels so called.

[. . . every geometrical form, as well as every number, has a definite, innate relation to some particular en tity on the other planes, to some colour or tone, for instance; and there is good reason to believe that this holds true of all the planes, that the entities on each of them are bound to the entities on all the others by certain spiritual relations which run like threads of gold through the different planes, binding them all together in one Divine Unity.] Here is the key so much desired by enterprising—indeed all—students. It is by means of these correlations of colour, sound, form, number, and substance—that the trained will of the Initiate rules and uses the denizens of the elemental world. Many theosophists have had slight conscious relations with elementals, but always without their will acting, and, upon trying to make elementals see, hear, or act for them, a total indifference on the part of the nature spirit is all they have got in return. These failures are due to the fact that the elemental cannot understand the thought of the person; it can only be reached when the exact scale of being to which it belongs is vibrated whether it be that of colour, form, sound, or whatever else. [The sacred theories of the East teach that man is the result of two converging curves of evolution, the on e curve ascending through the vegetable and animal kingdoms and marking the evolution of the physical body, while the other curve descends from a super-physical spiritual race, called by some the “Progenitors” or “ Pitris, ” . . . . . This curve marks the downward evolution of man’s spiritual nature the development of the soul.] There is an important point in the teachings of the Secret Doctrine which has been co ntinually neglected. The above described evolution—the spiritual falling into the physical, or from mineral up to man, takes place only during the 1st of the two subsequent Rounds. At the beginning of the fourth “Round” in the middle of which begins the turning point upward— i.e., from the physical up to the spiritual, man is said to appear before anything else on earth, the vegetation which covered the earth belonging to the 3rd Round, and being quite ethereal, transparent.

This is why in India gods are said to have no shadows. After which and from this primeval race, evolution supplies man with a “coat of skin” from the terrestrial elements and kingdom—mineral, vegetable, and animal. [the real elements are purer and more spiritual than their representatives on the physical plane] This is one reason for calling the objective phenomenal world an “illusion.” It is an il lusion and ever impermanent because the matter of which the objects are composed continually returns to the primordial condition of matter, where it is invisible to mortal eyes. The earth, water, air, and fire that we think we see are respectively only the effects produced on our senses by the primordial matter held in either of the combinations that bring about the vibration properly belonging to those classes: the moment the combination is entirely broken, the phenomena cease and we see the objects no more. ––––––––––"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Collected Writings VOLUME IX April, 1888 LETTER FROM H.

M Y D EAREST B ROTHER A ND C O F OUNDER O F T HE T HEOSOPHICAL S OCIETY : In addressing to you this letter, which I request you to read to the Convention summoned for April 22nd, I must first present my hearty congratulations and most cordial 242  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS go od wishes to the assembled Delegates and good Fellows of our Society, and to yourself—the heart and soul of that Body in America. We were several, to call it to life in 1875. Since then you have remained alone to preserve that life through good and evil report. It is to you chiefly, if not entirely, that the Theosophical Society owes its existence in 1888. Let me then thank you for it, for the first, and perhaps for the last, time publicly, and from the bottom of my heart, which beats only for the cause you represent so well and serve so faithfully. I ask you also to remember that, on this important occasion, my voice is but the feeble echo of other more sacred voices, and the transmitter of the approval of Those whose presence is alive in more than one true Theosophical heart, and lives, as I know, pre-eminently in yours. May the assembled Society feel the warm greeting as earnestly as it is given, and may every Fellow present, who realizes that he has deserved it, profit by the Blessings sent. Theosophy has lately taken a new start in America which marks the commencement of a new Cycle in the affairs of the Society in the West. And the policy you are now following is admirably adapted to give scope for the widest expansion of the movement, and to establish on a firm basis an organization which, while promoting feelings of fraternal sympathy, social unity, and solidarity, will leave ample room for individual freedom and exertion in the common cause—that of helping mankind. The multiplication of local centres should be a foremost consideration in your minds, and each man should strive to be a centre of work in himself. When his inner development has reached a certain point, he will naturally draw those with whom he is in contact under the same influence; a nucleus will be formed, round which other people will gather, forming a centre from which information and spiritual influence radiate, and towards"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"which higher influences are directed. But let no man set up a popery instead of Theosophy, as this would be suicidal and has ever ended most fatally. We are all fellow-students, more or less advanced; but no one belonging to the Theosophical Society ought to count L ETTER TO S ECOND A MERICAN C ONVENTION  243 hi mself as more than, at best, a pupil-teacher—one who has no right to dogmatize. Since the Society was founded, a distinct change has come over the spirit of the age. Those who gave us commission to found the Society foresaw this, now rapidly growing, wave of transcendental influence following that other wave of mere phenomenalism. Even the journals of Spiritualism are gradually eliminating the phenomena and wonders, to replace them with philosophy. The Theosophical Society led the van of this movement; but, although Theosophical ideas have entered into every development or form which awakening spirituality has assumed, yet Theosophy pure and simple has still a severe battle to fight for recognition. The days of old are gone to return no more, and many are the Theosophists who, taught by bitter experience, have pledged themselves to make of the Society a “miracle club” no longer. The faint-hearted have asked in all ages for signs and wonders, and when these failed to be granted, they refused to believe. Such are not those who will ever comprehend Theosophy pure and simple. But there are others among us who realize intuitionally that the recognition of pure Theosophy—the philosophy of the rational explanation of things and not the tenets—is of the most vital importance in the Society, inasmuch as it alone can furnish the beacon-light needed to guide humanity on its true path. This should never be forgotten, nor should the following fact be overlooked. On the day when Theosophy will have accomplished its most holy and most important mission—namely, to unite firmly a body of men of all nations in brotherly love and bent on a pure altruistic work, not on a labour with selfish motives—on that day only will Theosophy become higher than any nominal brotherhood of man. This will be a wonder and a miracle truly, for the realization of which Humanity is vainly waiting for the last 18 centuries, and which every association has hitherto failed to accomplish. Orthodoxy in Theosophy is a thing neither possible nor desirable. It is diversity of opinion, within certain limits, that keeps the Theosophical Society a living and a healthy 244  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS bo dy, its many other ugly features notwithstanding. Were it not, also, for the existence of a large amount of uncertainty in the minds of students of Theosophy, such healthy divergencies would be impossible, and the Society would degenerate into a sect, in which a"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"narrow and stereotyped creed would take the place of the living and breathing spirit of Truth and an ever growing Knowledge. According as people are prepared to receive it, so will new Theosophical teaching be given. But no more will be given than the world, on its present level of spirituality, can profit by. It depends on the spread of Theosophy—the assimilation of what has been already given—how much more will be revealed, and how soon. It must be remembered that the Society was not founded as a nursery for forcing a supply of Occultists—as a factory for the manufacture of Adepts. It was intended to stem the current of materialism, and also that of spiritualistic phenomenalism and the worship of the Dead. It had to guide the spiritual awakening that has now begun, and not to pander to psychic cravings which are but another form of materialism. For by “materialism” is meant not only an anti-philosophical negation of pure spirit, and, even more, materialism in conduct and action —brutality, hypocrisy, and, above all selfishness,—but also the fruits of a disbelief in all but material things, a disbelief which has increased enormously during the last century, and which has led many, after a denial of all existence other than that in matter, into a blind belief in the materialization of Spirit. The tendency of modern civilization is a reaction towards animalism, towards a development of those qualities which conduce to the success in life of man as an animal in the struggle for animal existence. Theosophy seeks to develop the human nature in man in addition to the animal, and at the sacrifice of the superfluous animality which modern life and materialistic teachings have developed to a degree which is abnormal for the human being at this stage of his progress. Men cannot all be Occultists, but they can all be Theosophists. Many who have never heard of the Society L ETTER TO S ECOND A MERICAN C ONVENTION  245 ar e Theosophists without knowing it themselves; for the essence of Theosophy is the perfect harmonizing of the divine with the human in man, the adjustment of his godlike qualities and aspirations, and their sway over the terrestrial or animal passions in him. Kindness, absence of every ill feeling or selfishness, charity, good-will to all beings, and perfect justice to others as to one’s self, are its chief features. He who teaches Theosophy preaches the gospel of good-will; and the converse of this is true also,—he who preaches the gospel of good-will, teaches Theosophy. This aspect of Theosophy has never failed to receive due and full recognition in the pages of the “ PATH ,” a journal of which the American Section has good reason to be pr oud. It is a teacher and a power; and the fact that such a periodical should be produced and supported in the United States speaks in eloquent praise both of` its Editor and its readers. America is also to be congratulated on the increase in the number of the Branches or Lodges which is now taking place. It is a sign that in things spiritual as well as things temporal the great American Republic is well fitted for independence and"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"self-organization. The Founders of the Society wish every Section, as soon as it becomes strong enough to govern itself, to be as independent as is compatible with its allegiance to the Society as a whole and to the Great Ideal Brotherhood, the lowest formal grade of which is represented by the Theosophical Society. Here in England Theosophy is waking into new life. The slanders and absurd inventions of the Society for Psychical Research have almost paralyzed it, though only for a very short time, and the example of America has stirred the English Theosophists into renewed activity. Lucifer sounded the reveille, and the first fruit has been the founding of the “Theosophical Publication Society.” This Society is of great importance. It has undertaken the very necessary work of breaking down the barrier of prejudice and ignorance which has formed so great an impediment to the spread of Theosophy. It will act as a recruiting agency for the Society by the wide distribution of elementary literature on the subject, among those who 246  B LAVATSKY: C OLLECTED W RITINGS a r e in any way prepared to give ear to it. The correspondence already received shows that it is creating an interest in the subject, and proves that in every large town in England there exist quite enough isolated Theosophists to form groups or Lodges under charter from the Society. But, at present, these students do not even know of each other’s existence, and many of them have never heard of the Theosophical Society until now. I am thoroughly satisfied of the great utility of this new Society, composed as it is to a large extent of members of the Theosophical Society, and being under the control of prominent Theosophists, such as you, my dear Brother W.Q. Judge, Mabel Collins, and the Countess Wachtmeister. I am confident that, when the real nature of Theosophy is understood, the prejudice against it, now so unfortunately prevalent, will die out. Theosophists are of necessity the friends of all movements in the world, whether intellectual or simply practical, for the amelioration of the conditions of mankind. We are the friends of all those who fight against drunkenness, against cruelty to animals, against injustice to women, against corruption in society or in government, although we do not meddle in politics. We are the friends of those who exercise practical charity, who seek to lift a little of the tremendous weight of misery that is crushing down the poor. But, in our quality of Theosophists, we cannot engage in any one of these great works in particular. As individuals we may do so, but as Theosophists we have a larger, more important, and much more difficult work to do. People say that Theosophists should show what is in them, that “the tree is known by its fruit.” Let them build dwellings for the poor, it is said let them open “soup-kitchens,” etc., etc., and the world will believe that there is something in Theosophy. These good people forget that Theosophists, as such, are poor, and that the Founders themselves are poorer than any, and that one of them, at any rate, the humble writer of these lines, has no property of her own, and has to work hard for her daily bread whenever she finds time from her Theosophical duties. The function of Theosophists is to open men’s hearts and"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"understandings to charity, justice, L ETTER TO S ECOND A MERICAN C ONVENTION  247 an d generosity, attributes which belong specifically to the human kingdom and are natural to man when he has developed the qualities of a human being. Theosophy teaches the animal-man to be a human-man; and when people have learnt to think and feel as truly human beings should feel and think, they will act humanely, and works of charity, justice, and generosity will be done spontaneously by all. Now with regard to The Secret Doctrine, the publication of which some of you urged so kindly upon me, and in such cordial terms, a while ago. I am very grateful for the hearty support promised and for the manner in which it was expressed. The MSS. of the first three volumes is now ready for the press; and its publication is only delayed by the difficulty which is experienced in finding the necessary funds. Though I have not written it with an eye to money, yet, having left Adyar, I must live and pay my way in the world so long as I remain in it. Moreover, the Theosophical Society urgently needs money for many purposes, and I feel that I should not be justified in dealing with The Secret Doctrine as I dealt with Isis Unveiled. From my former work I have received personally in all only a few hundred dollars, although nine editions have been issued. Under these circumstances I am endeavouring to find means of securing the publication of The Secret Doctrine on better terms this time, and here I am offered next to nothing. So, my dearest Brothers and Co-workers in the trans-Atlantic lands, you must forgive me the delay, and not blame me for it but the unfortunate conditions I am surrounded with. I should like to revisit America, and shall perhaps do so one day, should my health permit. I have received pressing invitations to take up my abode in your great country which I love so much for its noble freedom. Colonel Olcott, too, urges upon me very strongly to return to India, where he is fighting almost single-handed the great and hard fight in the cause of Truth; but I feel that, for the present, my duty lies in England and with the Western Theosophists, where for the moment the hardest fight against prejudice and ignorance has to be fought. 248  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Bu t whether I be in England or in India, a large part of my heart and much of my hope for Theosophy lie with you in the United States, where the Theosophical Society was founded, and of which country I myself am proud of being a citizen. But you must remember that, although there must be local Branches of the Theosophical Society, there can be no local Theosophists; and just as you all belong to the Society, so do I belong to you all. I shall leave my dear Friend and Colleague, Col. Olcott, to tell you all about the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"condition of affairs in India, where everything looks favourable, as I am informed, for I have no doubt that he also will have sent his good wishes and congratulations to your Convention.

In this month’s “Correspondence” several letters testify to the strong impression produced on some minds by our last month’s article “Practical Occultism.” Such letters go far to prove and strengthen two logical conclusions. ( a ) There are more well-educated and thoughtful men who believe in the existence of Occultism and Magic (the two differing vastly) than the modern materialist dreams of; and— ( b ) That most of the believers (comprising many theosophists) have no definite idea of the nature of Occultism and confuse it with the Occult sciences in general, the “Black art” included. Their representations of the powers it confers upon man, and of the means to be used to acquire them are as varied as they are fanciful. Some imagine that a master in the art, to show the way, is all that is needed to become a Zanoni. Others, that one has but to cross the Canal of Suez and go to India to bloom forth as a Roger Bacon or even a Count de St.-Germain. Many take for their ideal Margrave with his ever-renewing youth, and care little for the soul as the price paid for it. Not a few, mistaking “Witch-of-Endorism” pure and simple, for Occultism—”through the yawning Earth from Stygian gloom, call up the meagre ghost to walks of light,” and want, on the strength of this feat, to be regarded as full-blown Adepts. “Ceremonial Magic” according to the rules mockingly laid down by Éliphas Lévi, is another imagined alter-ego of the philosophy of the Arhats of old. In short, the prisms through which Occultism appears, to those innocent of the philosophy, are as multicoloured and varied as human fancy can make them. 250  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Wi ll these candidates to Wisdom and Power feel very indignant if told the plain truth?"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"It is not only useful, but it has now become necessary to disabuse most of them and before it is too late. This truth may be said in a few words: There are not in the West half-a-dozen among the fervent hundreds who call themselves “Occultists,” who have even an approximately correct ideal of the nature of the Science they seek to master. With a few exceptions, they are all on the highway to Sorcery. Let them restore some order in the chaos that reigns in their minds, before they protest against this statement. Let them first learn the true relation in which the Occult Sciences stand to Occultism, and the difference between the two, and then feel wrathful if they still think themselves right. Meanwhile, let them learn that Occultism differs from Magic and other secret Sciences as the glorious sun does from a rush-light, as the immutable and immortal Spirit of Man—the reflection of the absolute, causeless and unknowable ALL —differs from the mortal clay—the human body. In our highly civilized West, where modern languages have been formed, and words coined, in the wake of ideas and thoughts—as happened with every tongue—the more the latter became materialized in the cold atmosphere of Western selfishness and its incessant chase after the goods of this world, the less was there any need felt for the production of new terms to express that which was tacitly regarded as absolute and exploded “superstition.” Such words could answer only to ideas which a cultured man was scarcely supposed to harbour in his mind. “Magic,” a synonym for jugglery; “Sorcery,” an equivalent for crass ignorance; and “Occultism,” the sorry relic of crack-brained, mediaeval Fire-philosophers, of the Jacob Böhmes and the Saint-Martins, are expressions believed more than amply sufficient to cover the whole field of “thimble-rigging.” They are terms of contempt, and used generally only in reference to the dross and residues of the dark ages and its preceding aeons of paganism. Therefore have we no terms in the English tongue to define and shade the difference between such abnormal powers, or the sciences that lead to the O CCULTISM V ERSUS THE O CCULT A RTS  251 a c quisition of them, with the nicety possible in the Eastern languages—pre-eminently the Sanskrit. What do the words “miracle” and “enchantment” (words identical in meaning after all, as both express the idea of producing wonderful things by breaking the laws of nature (!!) as explained by the accepted authorities) convey to the minds of those who hear, or who pronounce them? A Christian —breaking “of the laws of nature,” notwithstanding—while believing firmly in the miracles, because said to have been produced by God through Moses, will either scout the enchantments performed by Pharaoh’s magicians, or attribute them to the devil. It is the latter whom our pious enemies connect with Occultism, while their impious foes, the infidels, laugh at Moses, Magicians, and Occultists, and would blush to give one serious thought to such “superstitions.” This, because there is no term in existence to show the difference; no words to express the lights and shadows and draw the line of demarcation between the sublime and the true, the absurd and the ridiculous. The latter are the theological interpretations which teach the “breaking of the laws of Nature” by man, God, or devil; the former—the scientific"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"“miracles” and enchantments of Moses and the Magicians in accordance with natural laws, both having been learned in all the Wisdom of the Sanctuaries, which were the “Royal Societies” of those days—and in true OCCULTISM . This last word is certainly mi sleading, translated as it stands from the compound word Gupta-Vidya, “Secret Knowledge.” But the knowledge of what? Some of the Sanskrit terms may help us. There are four (out of the many other) names of the various kinds of Esoteric Knowledge or Sciences given, even in the exoteric Puranas There is (1) Yajña-Vidya, * knowledge of the occult powers –––––––––– * The Yajña, s ay the Brahmans, exists from eternity, for it proceeded forth from the Supreme One . . . in whom it lay dormant from “no beginning.” It is the key to the TRAIVIDYA , the thrice sacred science co ntained in the Rig verses, which teaches the Yajus or sacrificial mysteries. “The Yajña exists as an invisible thing at –––––––––– 25 2  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS aw akened in Nature by the performance of certain religious ceremonies and rites. (2) Mahavidya, the “great knowledge,” the magic of the Kabalists and of the Tantrika worship, often Sorcery of the worst description. (3) Guhya-Vidya, knowledge of the mystic powers residing in Sound (Ether), hence in the Mantras (chanted prayers or incantations) and depending on the rhythm and melody used; in other words a magical performance based on Knowledge of the Forces of Nature and their correlation; and (4) A TMA -V IDYA , a te rm which is translated simply “knowledge of the Soul,” true Wisdom by the Orientalists, but which means far more. This last is the only kind of Occultism that any theosophist who admires Light on the Path, and who would be wise and unselfish, ought to strive after. All the rest is some branch of the “Occult Sciences,” i.e., arts based on the knowledge of the ultimate essence of all things in the Kingdoms of Nature—such as minerals, plants and animals—hence of things pertaining to the realm of material nature, however invisible that essence may be, and howsoever much it has hitherto eluded the grasp of Science. Alchemy, Astrology, Occult Physiology, Chiromancy, exist in Nature and the exact Sciences—perhaps so called, because they are found in this age of paradoxical philosophies the reverse—have already discovered not a few of the secrets of the above arts.

It includes them all and may even use them occasionally, but it does so after purifying them of their dross, for beneficent purposes, and taking care to deprive them of every element of selfish motive. Let us explain: any man or woman can set himself or herself to study one or all of the above specified “Occult Arts” without any great previous preparation, and even without adopting any too restraining mode of life. One could even dispense with any lofty standard of morality. In the last case, of course, ten to one the student would blossom into a very decent kind of sorcerer, and tumble down headlong into black magic. But what can this matter? The Voodoos and the Dugpas eat, drink and are merry over hecatombs of victims of their infernal arts. And so do the amiable gentlemen vivisectionists and the diploma-ed “Hypnotizers” of the Faculties of Medicine; the only difference between the two classes being that the Voodoos and Dugpas are conscious, and the Charcot-Richet crew unconscious, Sorcerers. Thus, since both have to reap the fruits of their labours and achievements in the black art, the Western practitioners should not have the punishment and reputation without the profits and enjoyments they may get therefrom. For we say it again, hypnotism and vivisection as practised in such schools, are Sorcery pure and simple, minus a knowledge that the Voodoos and Dugpas enjoy, and which no Charcot-Richet can procure for himself in fifty years of hard study and experimental observation. Let then those who will dabble in magic, whether they understand its nature or not, but who find the rules imposed upon students too hard, and who, therefore, lay Atma-Vidya or Occultism aside—go without it. Let them become magicians by all means, even though they do become Voodoos and Dugpas for the next ten incarnations. But the interest of our readers will probably centre on those who are invincibly attracted towards the “Occult,” yet who neither realise the true nature of what they aspire towards, nor have they become passion-proof, far less truly unselfish. 254  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Ho w about these unfortunates, we shall be asked, who are thus rent in twain by conflicting forces? For it has been said too often to need repetition, and the fact itself is patent to any observer, that when once the desire for Occultism has really awakened in a man’s heart, there remains for him no hope of peace, no place of rest and comfort in all the"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"world. He is driven out into wild and desolate spaces of life by an ever-gnawing unrest he cannot quell. His heart is too full of passion and selfish desire to permit him to pass the Golden Gate; he cannot find rest or peace in ordinary life. Must he then inevitably fall into sorcery and black magic, and through many incarnations heap up for himself a terrible Karma? Is there no other road for him? Indeed there is, we answer. Let him aspire to no higher than he feels able to accomplish. Let him not take a burden upon himself too heavy for him to carry. Without ever becoming a “Mahatma,” a Buddha or a Great Saint, let him study the philosophy and the “Science of Soul,” and he can become one of the modest benefactors of humanity, without any “superhuman” powers. Siddhis (or the Arhat powers) are only for those who are able to “lead the life,” to comply with the terrible sacrifices required for such a training, and to comply with them to the very letter. Let them know at once and remember always, that true Occultism or Theosophy is the “Great Renunciation of SELF ,” unconditionally and ab solutely, in thought as in action. It is ALTRUISM , and it throws him who practises it out of calculation of the ranks of the living altogether. “Not for himself, but for the world, he lives,” as soon as he has pledged himself to the work. Much is forgiven during the first years of probation. But, no sooner is he “accepted” than his personality must disappear, and he has to become a mere beneficent force in Nature. There are two poles for him after that, two paths, and no midward place of rest. He has either to ascend laboriously, step by step, often through numerous incarnations and no Devachanic break, the golden ladder leading to Mahatmaship (the Arhat or Bodhisattva condition), or—he will let himself slide down the ladder at the first false step, and roll down into Dugpaship. . . . O CCULTISM V ERSUS THE O CCULT A RTS  255 Al l this is either unknown or left out of sight altogether. Indeed, one who is able to follow the silent evolution of the preliminary aspirations of the candidates, often finds strange ideas quietly taking possession of their minds. There are those whose reasoning powers have been so distorted by foreign influences that they imagine that animal passions can be so sublimated and elevated that their fury, force, and fire can, so to speak, be turned inwards; that they can be stored and shut up in one’s breast, until their energy is, not expanded, but turned toward higher and more holy purposes: namely, until their collective and unexpanded strength enables their possessor to enter the true Sanctuary of the Soul and stand therein in the presence of the Master —the H IGHER S ELF ! For this purpose they wi ll not struggle with their passions nor slay them. They will simply, by a strong effort of will put down the fierce flames and keep them at bay within their natures, allowing the fire to smoulder under a thin layer of ashes. They submit joyfully to the torture of the Spartan boy who allowed the fox to devour his entrails rather than part with it. Oh, poor blind visionaries!

The “Master” in the Sanctuary of our souls is “the Higher Self”—the divine spirit whose consciousness is based upon and derived solely (at any rate during the mortal life of the man in whom it is captive) from the Mind, which we have agreed to call the Human Soul (the “Spiritual Soul” being the vehicle of the Spirit). In its turn the former (the personal or human soul) is a compound in its highest form, of spiritual aspirations, volitions, and 256  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS di vine love; and in its lower aspect, of animal desires and terrestrial passions imparted to it by its associations with its vehicle, the seat of all these. It thus stands as a link and a medium between the animal nature of man which its higher reason seeks to subdue, and his divine spiritual nature to which it gravitates, whenever it has the upper hand in its struggle with the inner animal. The latter is the instinctual “animal Soul” and is the hotbed of those passions, which, as just shown, are lulled instead of being killed, and locked up in their breasts by some imprudent enthusiasts. Do they still hope to turn thereby the muddy stream of the animal sewer into the crystalline waters of life? And where, on what neutral ground can they be imprisoned so as not to affect man? The fierce passions of love and lust are still alive and they are allowed to still remain in the place of their birth— that same animal soul; for both the higher and the lower portions of the “Human Soul” or Mind reject such inmates, though they cannot avoid being tainted with them as neighbours. The “Higher Self” or Spirit is as unable to assimilate such feelings as water to get mixed with oil or unclean liquid tallow. It is thus the mind alone, the sole link and medium between the man of earth and the Higher Self—that is the only sufferer, and which is in the incessant danger of being dragged down by those passions that may be re-awakened at any moment, and perish in the abyss of matter. And how can it ever attune itself to the divine harmony of the highest Principle, when that harmony is destroyed by the mere presence, within the Sanctuary in preparation, of such animal passions? How can harmony prevail and conquer, when the soul is stained and distracted with the turmoil of passions and the terrestial desires of the bodily senses, or even of the “Astral man”? For this “Astral”—the shadowy “double” (in the animal as in man) is not the companion of the divine Ego but of the earthly body. It is the link between the personal SELF, the lower consciousness of Manas and the Body, and is the vehicle of transitory, not of immortal life. Like the shadow projected by man, it follows his movements and impulses slavishly and mechanically, and leans therefore to "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"O CCULTISM V ERSUS THE O CCULT A RTS  257 ma tter without ever ascending to Spirit. It is only when the power of the passions is dead altogether, and when they have been crushed and annihilated in the retort of an unflinching will; when not only all the lusts and longings of the flesh are dead, but also the recognition of the personal Self is killed out and the “astral” has been reduced in consequence to a cipher, that the Union with the “Higher Self” can take place. Then when the “Astral” reflects only the conquered man, the still living but no more the longing, selfish personality, then the brilliant Augoeides, the divine S ELF , can vibrate in conscious ha rmony with both the poles of the human Entity—the man of matter purified, and the ever pure Spiritual Soul—and stand in the presence of the M ASTER S ELF , the Christos of the my stic Gnostic, blended, merged into, and one with IT for ever.* How then can it be thought possible for a man to enter the “straight gate” of occultism when his daily and hourly thoughts are bound up with worldly things, desires of possession and power, with lust, ambition and duties, which, however honourable, are still of the earth earthy? Even the love for wife and family—the purest as the most unselfish of human affections—is a barrier to real occultism. For whether we take as an example the holy love of a mother for her child, or that of a husband for his wife, even in these feelings, when analyzed to the very bottom, and thoroughly sifted, there is still selfishness in the first, and an égoisme à deux in the second instance.

This is but natural, we shall be told. Quite so; in the light of the code of human affections; less so, in that of divine universal love. For, while the heart is full of thoughts for a little group of selves, near and dear to us, how shall the rest of mankind fare in our souls? What percentage of love and care will there remain to bestow on the “great orphan”? And how shall the “still small voice” make itself heard in a soul entirely occupied with its own privileged tenants? What room is there left for the needs of Humanity en bloc to impress themselves upon, or even receive a speedy response? And yet, he who would profit by the wisdom of the universal mind, has to reach it through the whole of Humanity without distinction of race, complexion, religion or"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"social status. It is altruism, not ego-ism even in its most legal and noble conception, that can lead the unit to merge its little Self in the Universal Selves. It is to these needs and to this work that the true disciple of true Occultism has to devote himself, if he would obtain Theosophy, divine Wisdom and Knowledge. The aspirant has to choose absolutely between the life of the world and the life of Occultism. It is useless and vain to endeavour to unite the two, for no one can serve two masters and satisfy both. No one can serve his body and the higher Soul, and do his family duty and his universal duty, without depriving either one or the other of its rights; for he will either lend his ear to the “still small voice” and fail to hear the cries of his little ones, or, he will listen but to the wants of the latter and remain deaf to the voice of Humanity. It would be a ceaseless, a maddening struggle for almost any married man, who would pursue true practical Occultism, instead of its theoretical philosophy. For he would find himself ever hesitating between the voice of the impersonal divine love of Humanity, and that of the personal, terrestrial love. And this could only lead him to fail in one or the other, or perhaps in both his duties. Worse than this. For, whoever indulges after having pledged himself to OCCULTISM in the gratification of a terrestrial love or lust, must feel an al most immediate result; that of being irresistibly dragged from the impersonal divine state O CCULTISM V ERSUS THE O CCULT A RTS  259 do wn to the lower plane of matter. Sensual, or even mental self-gratification, involves the immediate loss of the powers of spiritual discernment; the voice of the M ASTER can no lo nger be distinguished from that of one’s passions or even that of a Dugpa; the right from wrong; sound morality from mere casuistry. The Dead Sea fruit assumes the most glorious mystic appearance, only to turn to ashes on the lips, and to gall in the heart resulting in:— “Depth ever deepening, darkness darkening still; Fo lly for wisdom, guilt for innocence; Anguish for rapture, and for hope despair.” And once being mistaken and having acted on their mistakes, most men shrink from re alising their error, and thus descend deeper and deeper into the mire. And, although it is the intention that decides primarily whether white or black magic is exercised, yet the results even of involuntary, unconscious sorcery cannot fail to be productive of bad Karma. Enough has been said to show that sorcery is any kind of evil influence exercised upon other persons, who suffer, or make other persons suffer, in consequence. Karma is a heavy stone splashed in the quiet waters of Life; and it must produce ever widening circles of ripples, carried wider and wider, almost ad infinitum. Such causes produced have to call forth effects, and these are evidenced in the just laws of Retribution. Much of this may be avoided if people will only abstain from rushing into practices neither the nature nor importance of which they understand. No one is expected to carry a burden beyond his strength and powers. There are “natural-born magicians”; Mystics and Occultists by birth, and by right of direct inheritance from a series of incarnations and"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"aeons of suffering and failures.

But they can be met only far and wide, and they pass through the narrow gates of Occultism because they carry no personal luggage of human transitory sentiments along with them. They have got rid of the feeling of the lower personality, paralyzed thereby the “astral” animal, and the golden, but narrow gate is thrown open before them. Not so with those who have to carry yet for several incarnations the burden of sins committed in previous lives, and even in their present existence. For such, unless they proceed with great caution, the golden gate of Wisdom may get transformed into the wide gate and the broad way “that leadeth unto destruction,” and therefore “many be they that enter in thereby.” This is the Gate of the Occult arts, practised for selfish motives and in the absence of the restraining and beneficent influence of A TMA -V IDYA . We are in the Kali Yuga and its fatal in fluence is a thousand-fold more powerful in the West than it is in the East; hence the easy preys made by the Powers of the Age of Darkness in this cyclic struggle, and the many delusions under which the world is now labouring. One of these is the relative facility with which men fancy they can get at the “Gate” and cross the threshold of Occultism without any great sacrifice. It is the dream of most Theosophists, one inspired by desire for Power and personal selfishness, and it is not such feelings that can ever lead them to the coveted goal. For, as well said by one believed to have sacrificed himself for Humanity—“narrow is the gate and straight the way that leadeth unto life” eternal, and therefore “few be they that find it.” So straight indeed, that at the bare mention of some of the preliminary difficulties the affrighted Western candidates turn back and retreat with a shudder. Let them stop here and attempt no more in their great weakness. For if, while turning their backs on the narrow gate, they are dragged by their desire for the Occult one step in the direction of the broad and more inviting Gates of that golden mystery which glitters in the light of illusion, woe to them!

Manu says (Chap. iii, 284), “The wise [the Initiated Adepts] call our fathers Vasus, our paternal grandfathers, Rudras; our paternal great grandfathers, Adityas; agreeably to a text of the Vedas,” these three classes have a direct reference in Esotericism ( a ) to the creators of man in his three chief aspects (or principles), and ( b ) to the three primeval and serial races of men who preceded the first physical and perfect Race, which the Eastern Occultists call the Atlanteans.

A.J. C. Prometheus, the grandest “Idea” in Grecian Mythology, represents the “Nous Agonistes”—the divine pa rt of the human soul— that fire-spark brought down by Prometheus from Heaven—and breathed into man—individualized in Man, which slowly—gradually —but surely, through and by means of agonizing conflicts with the lower Titanic earth nature, raises itself out of the lower material world into the ideal-—invisible. The lower nature is represented by the tyrannic—arbitrary Zeus, the “Nomos” or law of the phenomenal world perceived by the senses ( Jupiter est quodcunque vides ). Prometheus, the New or re-born Soul, baptized in fire=spirit, is that which is the opposite of Zeus—the invisible—the unseen—the nuomenal—working in the ideal world, the delights of which it is not given to the mere animal human mind to conceive. This Promethean soul of man come down from heaven can only be freed from the earth-chains and the Time-Vulture by the destruction of Zeus (that is, his transformation—transfiguration into the higher form), the phenomenal world, and by its elevation to a higher power, that of the ideal, the only real. Prometheus is moreover the revolt of the enlightened Soul against all false—popular—sacerdotal—established—hierarchical forms of religion, those religions which seek for personal salvation, founded on egoism, instead of general universal good and the salvation of all sentient beings. Prometheus is the Grecian form of the Atman of the Vedanta— the true ego, set free from incarnations in the masks (personae) of personality and the torture wheel of Necessity and Fate, and admitted into its rest and home in the universal—immanent Cosmic Spirit, escaped from the sorrows of the world of Creation.

In the words of Hesiod, ‘Epimetheus, befooled by the charms of Pandora, accepted her destructive gifts—gifts of the Immortals—and thereby brought misery and destruction to the human race.’ And Prometheus, who desired to raise the race, formed by himself to a resemblance to the Gods, suffers, chained to the rock, all the sufferings of man since he cherished in his bosom the desire of a higher freedom and knowledge. Here, on his rock, he represents, in his own person, the whole human race. The Vulture who gnaws his liver, which ever grows again, is an image of that eternal uneasiness and restless desire for higher things, which so tortures all mortals.” * In the account of the Crucifixion of Jesus, he is represented as receiving five wounds; may not these wounds have an esoteric-symbolical meaning? Man’s senses by which he perceives the phenomenal world are five, and may not these wounds on the cross ending in the death of the person (mask of the higher man), signify the death of all low, earthly desires having their origin in these five senses, and the consequent coming to life in a purer and higher sphere now totally inconceivable to us, all our concepts being derived from those earth senses? Nailing the feet takes away the power of moving towards any object of earth desire, as that of the hands, the organs of acquisition—now, too, generally of greed—deprives us of the power of seizing the objects of our acquisitiveness; the wound in the side kills the heart, that is all the desires of earth, and wakens us into the Nirvâna of Buddhism. The cross itself, to which the whole man was attached, is a well-known phallic emblem, representing the strongest form of human-earth sensuality; and that is a very symbol on which to crucify the man to death. ( Vide Editors’ Note 1, at the end of this article.) It is remarkable that in this legend Prometheus is represented as crowned with the Agnus-Castus plant (lugos), the leaves of which formed the Crown of the Victors in the “ Agonia “ of the Olympic games; Christ in his Victorious Agony was crowned with the thorny akanthus. This Agnus-Castus plant was used also in the fête of the Thesmophoria, in honour of Demeter—the law—“nomos”—bringer, whose priestesses slept on its leaves as encouraging chaste desires. In Christian times this custom survived among Nuns, who used to drink a water distilled from its leaves, and Monks used knives with handles made of its wood with the same intention of encouraging chastity. –––––––––– * [Hesiod, Wo rks and Days, 84-89; Theogony, 510-14.— Compiler .] –––––––––– 26 8  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" Chaucer, in his beautiful poem, “The Flower and the Leaf,” makes the Queen of the ladies of the lea f—those consecrated to spiritual love—carry branches of Agnus-Castus in her hand, and singing: “Suse le foyle, devers moi— Mon joly cuer est endormy.” Her heart was asleep to earth, but entranced in Heaven.* If it should be thought impious to attribute the expression of sorrow to the divine Being, it may be remarked that the Kabbala records an old tradition relating to the Schechinah (the female—mother—brooding element in God) in which she utters the following complaint for the evil in the world, and for the separation of the primal united dual elements in humanity. “Woe to me, I have driven away my children, and woe unto the children that they have been driven from the table of their Father!” —See Sympneumata [L.

This is one of the many semi-esoteric or mystical interpretations of the symbolical an d allegorical drama, which has been grafted and grown upon Christendom in its dead letter sense only—the “dead letter that killeth.” One of the seven esoteric meanings implied in the mystery of Crucifixion by the mystic inventors of the system—the original elaboration and adoption of which dates back into the night of time and the establishment of the MYSTERIES —is discovered in the ge ometrical symbols containing the history of the evolution of man. The Hebrews, whose prophet Moses was learned in the Wisdom of Egypt, and who adopted their numerical system from the Phoenicians, and later from the Gentiles from whom they borrowed most of their Kabalistic Mysticism, adapted most ingeniously the Cosmic and anthropological symbols of the “heathen” nations to their peculiar secret records.

The three nails with the three wounds are in number 6, which denotes the 6 faces of the cube unfolded [which make the cross or man-form, or 7, counting three horizontal and four vertical bars], on which the man is placed; and this in turn points to the circular measure transferred onto the edges of the cube.

[The above having been sent to the U.S.A. for the author of The Source of Measures to reply to his critic, the following is his answer. —Editor, Lucifer .] NO ERROR The paper of “Euphrates” finds me in the country without books of reference. The reason of the novel tra nslation of the words “eli eli, lama sabachthani” is as follows:—The record of the New Testament must stand as its own original authority, for it has no other authentic source. We are bound, therefore, to take, accept, and follow, its own statements for what they appear. A Greek sentence, lettering Hebrew words, must be rendered into the Hebrew agreeably to the equivalents of the letters in the Greek text. For instance, and in this case, there are two words in the Hebrew square letter, of the same sound but of different letters and meaning. One is the Chaldee 8\": and the other is the Hebrew ;\": . The first is, a nglicé, “shâb ā k,” meaning to fo rsake, and the other is shâb ā ch, meaning to g lorify. These words are the ones supposed to be substituted for the word used in the Psalm, azabthani, the pure word for “ forsaken me .” If in the Greek text, which is the only guide and authority we have, the word is found as F\"$\"P , it cannot properly he rendered otherwise in the Hebrew, or square letter, than by (\": , or, anglice, shâb ā c h. I S T HIS A N E RROR ?   277 The real word of the Greek text is F\"$\"P2\"<4 , or in proper conversion *1;(\": , or shâb ā c hthani , which does me an “ glorify me ,” and nothing else. Any change from this must and can be only by perversion, and by way of correction of the text of the New Testament. As used in the climacteric sentence of the whole symbolic fabricated drama, it was taken from the Mysteries, and never had any reality whatever. The matter has been referred to very learned Jews, and surprise has been expressed that in such a manifest difference between the indicated word and the correction adopted, no comment should exist of the fact of discrepancy, probably because it was thought best to slur, rather than lay the symbolic jugglery bare to the unthinking, ignorant herd. Difficulties arising from some fatal obstacle to the conversion of a fixed and necessary symbolic real reading, and some plausible popular rendering to cover the symbolism, are not infrequent either in the Hebrew or Greek. Such an one is in the Hebrew sentence descriptive of the first child born into the world, wherein the child is said to be Jehovah himself, and where the vulgar are thrown off by the interposition of the word “ from ,” so as to be read: “a child from , or the gift of, Jehovah.” A singular instance of a deceptive reading is as follows: Margoliouth, a very learned Jew, calls attention to the fact that the wearing of the “ fringes ” is alluded to in the New Testament—in the case of the woman troubled with an issue of blood, who thought that if she should but touch the “ hem of his garment ” she would recover. Here he says the Greek word is “ Craspedon ,” meaning, literally, if she could but touch the “ fringes ” of his garment. The wearing of the fringes had been commanded, to keep one in mind of the laws and ordinances, to obey them, but in lapse of time the custom had merged into a superstitious use, and the fringes were thought of as possessing a potent magical virtue, in, and of themselves. By this the woman thought that she could be cured by the magical virtue if she but touched them. Then it is that perceiving that virtue had gone out of him, the Master said the woman was right, and thus endorsed the fetish and its curative property. But by the same reception the garment on which the fringes were worn was esteemed to be a much stronger fetish, and possessed of magical virtues far more potent than the fringes themselves. This garment had a name, and was specifically called the “ Talith. ” Now in the Gospel of Mark the narrative is such as to set forth the conviction of the magical properties of both the fringes and the Talith on which they were worn. While the woman having the issue of blood is being cured by her touch of the fringes, the ruler enters the crowd with information that his daughter is dead, and then follows the recital. He takes the girl by the hand and says “ Talitha cumi ,” which, being"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"interpreted, is Damsel, I say unto thee, arise .” The word “ Talith ,” is from the Hebrew tâl ā l, meaning, to c lothe, and means “ a garment ,” and that garment on which the fringes were worn. It has no such meaning as “ damsel .” The sentence seems only proper as a command to a person addressed by a proper 27 8  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS name, as “ Talitha arise ! ” But in the connection, to mention the word itself, was to give the whole symbolism away as embracing the Talith and the Fringes worn on it, as a favourite fetish, therefore the word was given to those who understood, and the paraphrase of “ Damsel, I say unto thee, arise ,” was made for the vulgar and the unlearned. It was an easy and cheap piece of innocent cheat. “Cheap John” miracles were performed with just as much ease as the fabrication of a nursery story to cover a corner puzzle or conundrum. It was of a piece with the story of boys making mud pies and birds, as to which the birds of one of the boys flew away. In another passage of the Greek we read “why are ye baptized for the dead?” where the broad unmeaning ,B4 is placed in the margin for the real word of the text ßB,D meaning “ for the salvation of ”; the real significance having reference to a custom of vicarious baptism by placing the dead unbaptised on a bench, with a live person underneath. The question was asked of the corpse: “Wilt thou be baptised?” with answer of proxy “I will,” and the live man was baptised ßB,D JT< <,6DT< , in place of, o r for the benefit or salvation of the dead. So transparent a fraud would not do for an average public, although it might tend to lead the stupid towards “High Church.” But one of the most interesting and instructive pieces of imposition is one recorded outside the sacred record, by a shepherd of the flock. It is contained in the rare history of that king of butchers Constantine, and of that chief theological diplomatist Eusebius. Constantine was a worshipper of Mithras, the Sun-God, whose priests were the Magi, who observed the natal day of that God every 25th of December or Christmas day, and whose mode of religion embraced baptism, a eucharistic feast, confession, resurrection from the dead, and angelology with hell: so running on all fours with the Christianity which Constantine co-adapted with his Mithraic observance, that the Christian fathers had to claim, to save themselves from the charge of theft, that the Devil with his usual cunning and astuteness had prophetically anticipated the whole business, to make a claim of priority when the time should come to ply his little game of thimble rig. Constantine was either for Mithras or the other, agreeably to circumstances, standing as he did half-way betwixt with the difference only of a name to call the thing by. His coin bore on the reverse, “ To the invincible Sun, my guardian ,” while the other “ first called Christians at Antioch ,” was lord of the eighth day, or the day of that same invincible Sun, called Sunday. Now the time came for this goody-goody to die, and he wished to make the work of his statesmanship complete, in the consolidation of the empire by the cementing influence of a new form of a very old Persian and Hebrew religion, to be enforced by the strong hand of the civil government. For this purpose he is baptised with great pomp and ceremony on Whitsun Sunday. And as to this, that arch-fraud Eusebius comments as follows: “ And on the Pentecostel Sunday itself, the seventh Lord’s day from Easter , AT THE NOONTIDE HOUR of the day , BY THE SUN , Constantine was received up to H IS G OD .” Let us pa raphrase the “lay” of our “Now you see it and now you don’t.” The sun being in the South as the I S T HIS A N E RROR ?   279 beauty and glory of the day— at high noon—on the meridian, the soul of our brother Constantine ascended in a plumb line directly to his God; and so says the master of the Lodge, Amen.” Let us, to close, refer to a bare-faced interpolation in the sacred record, serving by deceiving locution the commendable purpose of a chain to bind the edifice of the Church of Constantine and Eusebius more firmly and compactly together. When the Master says to Peter: “Thou art Peter the stone and on this stone I will"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"found my Church, and the gates of Hell,” etc., there was nothing known but the Temple and Synagogue. The word Synagogue meant the Congregation, whereas it was long after, that the faction or split or separation was formed which was called Ecclesia, Church, or Separatists or Come-outers. Peter must have had an exceedingly stupid vacant look as he listened to this Hottentot statement. Now a very learned divine, who caught on to the difficulty, said that this was evidently an expression used prophetically, which by the assistance of the power of the Holy Spirit Peter was enabled to understand by clairvoyance. But “Go to! Go to!” It displays irreverence to look too closely into the make-up of the sacred text, for its composition. We should accept the broad ideal without any vain and prurient curiosity.

II, No. 9, May, 1888, pp. 254-260] To the Editor of Lucifer. Since the two Editors repeatedly assert their willingness in their great impartiality to publish even “personal remarks” upon themselves (Vide Lucifer, Vol. I, February, 1888, p. 432), I avail myself of the opportunity. Having read Esoteric Buddhism with much interest and general approval of the main drift of its teachings, I am anxious, with your kind permission, to formulate an objection to some points in Mr. Sinnett’s view of Evolution which have completely staggered my friends and myself. They appear to upset once and for all the explanation of the origin of man propounded by that popular author. Mr. Sinnett has, however, so uniformly expressed his willingness to answer honest criticism that I may, perhaps, hope for his assistance in solving this difficulty. Meanwhile, despite my favourable bias towards Theosophy, I must, perforce, express my conviction that one aspect of the Esoteric Doctrine— supposing of course that Mr. Sinnett is to be regarded as absolutely authoritative on the point —is opposed to Science. The point is one of fundamental importance as will be readily recognised by all —except, perhaps, by some too . . . . well, too admiring Theosophists. In Esoteric Buddhism we are confronted with a general acceptance of Darwinism. Physical Man, in particular, is said to have been evolved from ape ancestors. “Man, says the Darwinian, was once an ape. Quite true; but the ape known [??] to the Darwinian will never become a man— i.e., the form will not change from generation to generation till the tail disappears and the hands turn into feet, and so on . . . if we go back far enough, we come to a period at which there were no human forms ready developed on earth. When spiritual monads, travelling on the earliest or lowest human level, were thus beginning to come round [the Planetary ALFRED PERCY SINNETT (1840-1921) Reproduced from The Theosophist, Vol. XXX, September, 1909."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":" A P UZZLE IN E SOTERIC B UDDHISM  281 chain to this globe], the ir onward pressure in a world at that time containing none but animal forms provoked the improvement of the highest of these into the required form — the much-talked-of missing link .”—( Esoteric Buddhism , 5th ed. pp. 82-3.) And again: “. . . the mineral kingdom will no more develop the vegetable kingdom . . . until it receives an impulse from without, than the earth was able to develop man from the ape till it received an impulse from without.” ( Ibid ., p. 89.) The theory here broached is to the effect that the development of the ape into man was brought about by the incarnation of Human Egos from the last planet in the septenary chain of globes. I may here remark that in referring to our supposed animal progenitors as the apes “known” to the Darwinian, Mr. Sinnett exceeds in audacity the boldest Evolutionist. For this hypothetical creature is not known at all, being conspicuous by its absence from any deposits yet explored. This, however, is a minor point. The real indictment to which I have been leading up is to follow. We are told that occultists divide the term Human existence on this planet into seven Race Periods. At the present time the 5th of these races, the Aryan, is in the ascendant, while the 4th is still represented by teeming populaces. The 3rd is almost extinct. Now on page 106 of Esoteric Buddhism we are told regarding the 4th Race men that:— “In the Eocene Age . . . . even in its very first part, the great cycle of the fourth race men, the Atlanteans, had already reached its highest point.” Here, then, is a distinct landmark in the Esoteric Chronology pointed out to us. Summarizing these data we find ourselves confronted with the following propositions: (1) Humanity was developed physically from apes. (2) The 4th Race reached its prime at the commencement of the Eocene Age of Geology. (3) The three first Races (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) must therefore have antedated the Eocene Age by an enormous extent of time, even if we allow a much shorter period for their development than for the 4th and 5th. The 1st race, in fact, must have preceded the Tertiary Period by several millions of years. (4) This pre-Tertiary 1st Race was therefore derived from a still earlier ape stock . At this point the fabric of theory collapses. It is necessary to say that Science has been unable to find a trace of an anthropoid ape previous even to the relatively late Miocene Age ? Now the Eocene precede the Miocene rocks, and the 1st Race, as already shown, must have antedated even the era of the Eocene; it must have stretched far back into that dim and distant past when the chalk cliffs of the Secondary period 28 2  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS were deposited! How then can Mr. Sinnett claim his view of Human Evolution as merely “complementary” to Da rwin’s, when he binds himself to a chronology compared with the duration of which the Evolutionist one sinks into insignificance? Palaeontologists unanimously refuse to admit the existence of the higher apes previous to the Tertiary Period, and Darwin would have smiled at the notion. As a matter of fact, only the very lowest mammalians had made their appearance before the Eocene strata were formed. This is the view of the Science to which Mr. Sinnett invites us to bow with due reverence. Apparently he has been unconsciously nursing a viper in his bosom, for the same Science now “turns and strikes him.” I ask, H OW THEN WAS THE"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"1ST RACE EVOLVED FROM APES AEONS OF YEARS BEFORE SUCH APES EXISTED ?

April 20, Aberdeen. EDITOR’S N OTE .—The above letter is an arraignment either of the Esoteric Doctrine or of its expounders. Now the doctrine itself is unassailable, though its expounders may often make mistakes in their presentation of it; particularly when, as in the case of the author of Esoteric Buddhism, the writer was only very partially informed upon the subjects he treats of. Leaving the author of Esoteric Buddhism to answer the criticism for himself, one of the editors of Lucifer, as a person indirectly concerned with the production of the said work, begs the privilege of saying a few words upon the subject. It was as a special favour to herself that the teachings contained in Mr. Sinnett’s volume were first begun; she was the only one of the party concerned with these studies who had received for a series of years instruction in them. Therefore no one can know better than herself what was, or was not, meant in such or another tenet of this particular doctrine. Our correspondent should bear in mind therefore, that: ( a ) At the time of the publication of Esoteric Buddhism ( Budhism * would be more correct) the available Occult –––––––––– * Budhism w o uld mean “Wisdom,” from Budha, “a sage,” “a wise man,” and the imperative verb “ Budhyadhwam ,” “Know”; and Buddhism –––––––––– A P U ZZLE IN E SOTERIC B UDDHISM  283 da ta were comparatively scanty in its author’s hands. Otherwise, he would not have seemed to derive man from the ape—a theory absurd and impossible in the sight of the M ASTERS . ( b ) O nly a tentative effort was being cautiously made to test the readiness of the public to assimilate the elements of Esoteric philosophy. For Mr. Sinnett was left largely to his own resources and speculations and very naturally followed the bend of his own mind, which, though greatly favouring esoteric philosophy, was, nevertheless, decidedly biassed by modern science. Consequently, the revelations then broached were purposely designed to rather afford a bird’s-eye view of the doctrine than to render a detailed treatment of any special problem possible. The teachings were not given at first with the object of publication. No regular systematic teaching was ever contemplated, nor could it be so given to a layman; therefore that teaching consisted of detached bits of information in the shape of answers in private letters to questions offered upon most varied subjects, on Cosmogony and Psychology, Theogony and"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Anthropology, and so on. Moreover, more queries were left without any reply and full explanation refused—as the latter belong to the mysteries of Eastern Initiation—than there were problems solved.

Nevertheless, as our critic readily admits, all these difficulties notwithstanding, Mr. Sinnett has produced a most interesting and valuable work. That, in his too exaggerated respect and admiration for modern science, he seems to have somewhat materialized the teachings is what every metaphysician will admit. But it is also true, that the writer of Esoteric Buddhism would be the last man to claim any more “ authoritative character” for his book, than what is given to it by the few verbatim quotations from the teachings of a Master, more particularly when treating of such moot questions as that of Evolution. The point on which his critic lays such stress—the incompatibility of the statements made in his work as to the origin of Man on this planet—certainly invalidates Mr. Sinnett’s attempted reconciliation (if it is such) of the Darwinian and Esoteric Schemes of human evolution. But at this every true Theosophist, who expects no recognition of the truths he believes in at present, but feels sure of their subsequent triumph at a future day, can only rejoice. Scientific theories or rather conjectures are really too materialistic to be reconciled with “ Esoteric Budhism .” As the whole problem, however, is one of great complexity it would be out of the question to do any justice to it in the space of a brief note.

For the Western mind, steeped as it has been for generations in “Individualism,” it is very difficult to recognise the justice and consequently the truth of this statement, and it is very much to be desired that some further explanation should be given for a fact which some few may feel intuitively but for which they are quite unable to give any logical reason.

The little unfortunate wretch who is trained by his parents to pick pockets in the streets is not responsible for the sin, but the effects of it fall heavily on those who have impressed on his mind that it was the right thing to do. Let us hope that the Western Mind, although being “steeped in Individualism,” has not become so dulled thereby as not to perceive that there would be neither logic nor justice were it otherwise. And if the moulders of the plastic mind of the yet unreasoning child must be held responsible, in this world of effects for his sins of omission and commission during his childhood and for effects produced by their early training in after-life, how much more the “Spiritual Guru”?

The answer to the above query is here in a nutshell. It may be useful, if once more disagreeable, to some religionists to be told that the blame for this universal suffering falls entirely upon our Western religion and early education. Every philosophical Eastern system, every religion and sect in antiquity—the Brahmanical, Egyptian, Chinese and finally, the purest as the noblest of all the existing systems of ethics, Buddhism—inculcates kindness and protection to every living creature, from animal and bird down to the creeping thing and even the reptile.

And having been answered in the affirmative, as the prisoner had been a servant in the employ of a Russian colonel, “a mighty hunter before the Lord,” the Judge had no need of any other evidence and the murderer was found “guilty”—justly, as his subsequent confession proved.

In the case of our correspondent especially, and in his future capacity of medical doctor, the Occult knowledge of simples and minerals, and the curative powers of certain things in Nature, is far more important and useful than metaphysical and psychological Occultism or Theophany. And this he can do better by studying and trying to understand Paracelsus and the two Van Helmonts, than by assimilating Patañjali and the methods of Taraka-Raja-Yoga. It is possible to study “Occultism” (the Occult sciences or arts is more correct) in Britain, as on any other point of the globe; though owing to the tremendously adverse conditions created by the intense selfishness that prevails in the country, and a magnetism which is repellant to a free manifestation of Spirituality—solitude is the best condition for study.

They appear, in particular, to have touched the Jesuit party in France somewhat nearly. Several correspondents have written calling attention to the danger incurred by Theosophists in raising up against themselves such virulent and powerful foes. Some of our friends would have us keep silent on these topics. Such is not, however, the policy of Lucifer, nor ever will be. Therefore, the present opportunity is taken to state, once for all, the views which Theosophists and Occultists entertain with regard to the Society of Jesus. At the same time, all those who are pursuing in life’s great wilderness of vain evanescent pleasures and empty conventionalities an ideal worth living for, are offered the choice between the two now once more rising powers—the Alpha and the Omega at the two opposite ends of the realm of giddy, idle existence––T HEOSOPHY and J ESUITISM . Fo r, in the field of religious and intellectual pursuits, these two are the only luminaries—a good and an evil star, truly—glimmering once more from behind the mists of the Past, and ascending on the horizon of mental activities. They are the only two powers capable in the present day of extricating one thirsty for intellectual life from the clammy slush of the stagnant pool known as Modern Society, so crystallized in its cant, so dreary and monotonous in its squirrel-like motion around the wheel of fashion. Theosophy and Jesuitism are the two opposite poles, one far above, the other far below even that stagnant marsh. Both offer power—one to the spiritual, the other to the psychic and intellectual Ego in man. The former is “the wisdom that is from above. . . first pure, then peaceable, gentle . . . . . full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy,” while the latter is the “wisdom [that] descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, DEVILISH .” * One is the power of Light, the other that of Darkness. . . . .

But the cycle is rapidly approaching the last limit of its turning point. One out of the three great churches of Christendom is split into atomic sects, whose number increases yearly; and a house divided against itself, as is the Protestant Church— MUST FALL . The third, the Roman Catholic, the on ly one that has hitherto succeeded in appearing to retain all its integrity, is rapidly decaying from within. It is honeycombed throughout, and is being devoured by the ravenous microbes begotten by Loyola. It is no better now than a Dead Sea fruit, fair for some to look at, but full of the"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"rottenness of decay and death within. Roman Catholicism is but a name. As a Church it is a phantom of the Past and a mask. It is absolutely and indissolubly bound up with, and fettered by the Society of Ignatius Loyola; for, as rightly expressed by Lord Robert Montagu, the Roman Catholic Church is now “the largest secret society in the world, beside which Freemasonry is but a pigmy.” 3 Protestantism is slowly, insidiously, but as su rely, infected with Latinism—the new ritualistic sects of the High Church, and such men among its clergy as Father Rivington, being undeniable evidence of it. In fifty years more at the present rate of success of Latinism among the “upper ten,” the English aristocracy will have returned to the faith of King Charles II, and its servile copyist—mixed Society—will have followed suit. And then the Jesuits will begin to reign alone and supreme over the Christian portions of the globe, for they have crept even into the Greek Church. It is vain to argue and claim a difference between Jesuitism and Roman Catholicism proper, for the latter is now sucked into and inseparably amalgamated with the former. We have public assurance for it in the Pastoral of 1876 by the Bishop of Cambrai. “ Clericalism, Ultramontanism and Jesuitism are one and the same thing—that is to say, Roman Catholicism— and the distinctions between them have been created by the enemies of religion,” says the “Pastoral.” “There was a time,” adds Monseigneur 294  B LAVATSKY ’: COLLECTE D WRITING S t h e Cardinal, “when a certain theological opinion was commonly professed in France concerning the authority of the Pope. . . . It was restricted to our nation, and was of recent origin. The civil power during a century and a half imposed official instruction. Those who professed these opinions were called Gallicans, and those who protested were called Ultramontanes, because they had their doctrinal centre beyond the Alps, at Rome. Today the distinction between the two schools is no longer admissible. Theological Gallicalism can no longer exist, since this opinion has ceased to be tolerated by the Church. It has been solemnly condemned, past all return, by the Oecumenical Council of the Vatican. O NE CANNOT NOW BE C ATHOLIC WITHOUT BEING U LTRAMONTANE — AND J ESUIT .” 4 A p lain statement; and as cool as it is plain. The Pastoral made a certain noise in France and in the Catholic world, but was soon forgotten. And as two centuries have rolled away since an exposé of the infamous principles of the Jesuits was made (of which we will speak presently), the “Black Militia” of Loyola has had ample time to lie so successfully in denying the just charges, that even now, when the present Pope has brilliantly sanctioned the utterance of the Bishop of Cambrai, the Roman Catholics will hardly confess to such a thing. Strange exhibition of infallibility in the Popes! The “infallible” Pope, Clement XIV (Ganganelli), suppressed the Jesuits on the 21st of July, 1773, and yet they came to life again; the “infallible” Pope, Pius VII, re-established them on the 7th of August, 1814. 5 The infallible Pope Pius IX, 6 tr avelled, during the whole of his long Pontificate, between the Scylla and Charybdis of the Jesuit question; his infallibility helping him very little.

The recent Brevet of the Pope (hardly two years old) dated July 13th (the same fatal figures), 1886, is an event, the importance of which can never be overvalued. It begins with the words Dolemus inter alia, and reinstalls the Jesuits in all the rights of the Order that had ever been T HEOSOPHY OR J ESUITISM ?  295 ca ncelled. It was a manifesto and a loud defiant insult to all the Christian nations of the New and the Old worlds. From an article by Louis Lambert in the Gaulois (August 18th, 1886) we learn that “In 1750 there were 40,000 Jesuits all over the world. In 1800, officially they were reckoned at about 1,000 men, only. In 1886, they numbered between 7 and 8,000.” 8 This last modest number can well be doubted. For, verily now— Where you meet a man believing in the salutary nature of falsehoods, or the divine authority of things do ubtful, and fancying that to serve the good cause he must call the devil to his aid, there is a follower of Unsaint Ignatius, says Carlyle, and adds of that black militia of Ignatius that: They have given a new substantive to modern languages. The word Jesuitism now, in all countries, ex presses an idea for which there was in nature no prototype before. Not till these last centuries had the human soul generated that abomination, or needed to name it. Truly they have achieved great things in the world, and a general result that we may call stupendous. 9 And now since their reinstalment in Germany and elsewhere, they will achieve still gr ander and more stupendous results. For the future can be best read by the past. Unfortunately in this year of the Pope’s jubilee the civilized portions of humanity—even the Protestant ones—seem to have entirely forgotten that past. Let then those who profess to despise Theosophy, the fair child of early Aryan thought and Alexandrian Neo-Platonism, bow before the monstrous Fiend of the Age, but let them not forget at the same time its history. It is curious to observe, how persistently the Order has assailed everything like Occultism from the earliest times, and Theosophy since the foundation of` its last Society, which is ours. The Moors and the Jews of Spain felt the weight of the oppressive hand of Obscurantism no less than did the Kabalists and Alchemists of the Middle Ages. One would think Esoteric philosophy and especially the Occult Arts, or Magic, were an abomination to those good 296  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" holy fathers? And so indeed they would have the world believe. But when one studies history and the works of their own authors published with the imprimatur of the Order, what does one find? That the Jesuits have practised not only Occultism, but BLACK MAGIC in its worst form,* more than any other body of men; and that to it they owe in large measure their power and influence ! To refresh the memory of our readers and all those whom it may concern, a short summary of the doings and actings of our good friends, may be once more attempted. For those who are inclined to laugh, and deny the subterranean and truly infernal means used by “Ignatius’ black militia,” we may state facts! In Isis Unveiled it was said of the holy Fraternity that— . . . though established only in 1535 to 1540—in 1555 there was already general outcry raised against them. 10 And now once more— . . . that crafty, learned, conscienceless, terrible soul of Jesuitism, within the body of Romanism, is slowly but su rely possessing itself of the whole prestige and spiritual power that clings to it. . . . . . . .

Their constitutions were translated into Latin by the Jesuit Polancus, and printed in the college of the Society at Rome, in 1558. “They were jealously kept secret, the greater part of the Jesuits themselves knowing only extracts from them. They were never produced to the light until 1761, when they were published by order of the French Parliament [in 1761, 1762], in the famous process of Father Lavalette.” §. . . . . . . . .

In the subterranean chapel of the Church of Montmartre, surrounded by a few priests and students of theology, he received their pledges to devote their whole lives to the spreading of Roman Catholicism by every and all means, whether good or foul; and he was thus enabled to establish a new Order. Loyola proposed to his six chief companions that their Order should be a militant one, in order to fight for the interests of the Holy seat of Roman Catholicism. Two means were adopted to make the object answer; the education of youth, and proselytism ( apostolat ) . This was during the reign of Pope Paul III, who gave his full sympathy to the new scheme. Hence in 1540 was published the famous papal bull— Regimini militantis ecclesiae (the regimen of the warring, or militant Church)—after which the Order began increasing rapidly in numbers and power 17 . At the death of Loyola, the society counted more than one thousand Jesuits, though admission into the ranks was, as alleged, surrounded with extraordinary difficulties. It was another celebrated and unprecedented bull, issued by Pope Julius the III in 1552, 18 that br ought the Order of Jesus to such eminence and helped it towards such rapid increase; for it placed the society outside and beyond the jurisdiction of local ecclesiastical authority, granted the Order its own laws, and permitted it to recognise but one supreme authority—that of its General, whose residence was then at Rome. The results of such an arrangement proved fatal to the Secular Church. High prelates and Cardinals had very often to tremble before a simple subordinate of the Society of` Jesus. Its generals always got the upper hand in Rome, and enjoyed the unlimited confidence of the Popes, who thus frequently became tools in the hands of the Order. Naturally enough, in those days when political power was one of` the rights of the “Vicegerants of God”—the strength of the crafty society became"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"–––––––––– * Or “ St. Inigo the Biscayan,” by his true name. –––––––––– 300  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS si mply tremendous. In the name of the Popes, the Jesuits thus granted to themselves unheard-of privileges, which they enjoyed unstintedly up to the year 1773. In that year, Pope Clement XIV published a new bull, Dominus ac Redemptor (the Lord and Redeemer), abolishing the famous Order. 19 But the Popes proved helpless before the new Fr ankenstein, the fiend that one of the “Vicars of God” had evoked. The society continued its existence secretly, notwithstanding the persecutions of both Popes and the lay authorities of every country. In 1801, under the new alias of the “Congregation of the Sacré Coeur de Jésus ,” it had already penetrated into and was tolerated in Russia and Sicily. In 1814, as already said, a new bull of Pius VII resurrected the Order of Jesus, though its late privileges, even those among the lay clergy, were withheld from it. 20 The lay au thorities, in France as elsewhere, have found themselves compelled ever since to tolerate and to count with the Jesuits. All that they could do was to deny them any special privileges and subject the members of that society to the laws of the country, equally with other ecclesiastics. But, gradually and imperceptibly the Jesuits succeeded in obtaining special favours even from the lay authorities. Napoleon III granted them permission to open seven colleges in Paris only, for the education of the young, the only condition exacted being, that these colleges should be under the authority and supervision of local bishops. But the establishments had hardly been opened when the Jesuits broke that rule. The episode with the Archbishop Darboy is well known. Desiring to visit the Jesuit college in the Rue de la Poste (Paris), he was refused admittance, and the gates were closed against him by order of the Superior. The Bishop lodged a complaint at the Vatican. But the answer was delayed for such a length of time, that the Jesuits remained virtually masters of the situation and outside of every jurisdiction but their own. And now read what Lord R. Montagu says of their deeds in Protestant England, and judge: Think of even a part of it—the Jesuit Society—with its Nihilist adherents in Russia, its Socialist allies in G e rmany, its Fenians and T HEOSOPHY OR J ESUITISM ?  301 Nationalists in Ireland, its accomplices and its slaves in its power; think of that Society which has not sc rupled to stir up the most bloody wars between nations, in order to advance its purposes; and yet can stoop to hunting down a single man because he knows their secret and will not be their slave—hunting him down,"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"discrediting him, and thwarting him at every turn, with the cool calculation that they will either drive him mad or make him put an end to himself, so that the secret may be buried with him. Think of a Society which can devise such a diabolical scheme, and then boast of it; and say whether a desperate energy is not required in us. . . . If you had been behind the scenes . . . . then you would still have before you the labour of unravelling all that is being done by our Government, and of tearing off the tissue of lies by which their acts are concealed. Repeated attempts will have taught you that there is not a public man on whom you can lean. Because, as England is “between the upper and nether millstone” none but adherents or slaves are now advanced; and it stands to reason that the Jesuits, who have got that far, have prepared new millstones, for the time when the present ones shall have passed away; and then, again, younger millstones to come on after, and wield the power of the nation.* In France the affairs of the sons of Loyola flourished to the day when the ministry of Ju les Ferry compelled them to retire from the field of battle. Many are those who still remember the useless strictness of the police measures, and the clever enacting of dramatic scenes by the Jesuits themselves. This only added to their popularity with certain classes. They obtained thereby an aureole of martyrdom, and the sympathy of every pious and foolish woman in the land was secured to them. And now that Pope Leo XIII has once more restored to the good fathers, the Jesuits, all the privileges and rights that had ever been granted to their predecessors, what can the public at large of Europe and America expect? Judging by the bull , the complete mastery, moral and physical, over every land where there are Roman Catholics, is secured to the Black Militia. For in this bull the Pope confesses that of all the religious congregations now existing, that of the Jesuits is the one dearest to his heart .

And as it is they who guide him, we see his Holiness coquetting and flirting with every great European potentate—from Bismarck down to the crowned heads of Continent and Isle. In view of the ever increasing influence of Leo XIII, moral and political—such a certitude for the Jesuits is of no mean importance. For more minute particulars the reader is referred to such well-known authors as Lord Robert Montagu in England; and on the Continent, Edgard Quinet: l ’ Ultramontanisme; Michelet: Le Prêtre, la Femme et la Famille; Paul Bert: La Morale des Jésuites; Friedrich Nippold: Handbuch der Neuesten Kirchengeschichte and Welche Wege führen nach Rome ? etc., etc. Meanwhile, let us remember the words of warning we received from one of our late Theosophists, Dr. Kenneth Mackenzie, who, speaking of the Jesuits, says that:—"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"‘Their spies are everywhere, of all apparent ranks of society, and they may appear learned and wise, or simple and foolish, as their instructions run. There are Jesuits of both sexes and all ages, and it is a well-known fact that members of the Order, of high family and delicate nurture, are acting as menial servants in Protestant families, and doing other things of a similar nature in aid of the Society’s purposes. We cannot be too much on our guard, for the whole Society, being founded on a law of unhesitating obedience, can bring its force on any given point with unerring and fatal accuracy.’ * The Jesuits maintain that “the Society of Jesus is not of human invention, but it pr oceeded from him whose name it bears. For Jesus himself described that rule of life which the society follows, first by his example, and afterwards by his words.” † Let, then, all pious Christians listen and acquaint themselves with this alleged “rule of life” and precepts of their God, as exemplified by the Jesuits. Peter Alagona ( S . Thomae Aquinatis Summae Theologiae Compendium ) says: “By the command of God it is lawful to kill an innocent person, to steal, or to commit. . . . . . ( Ex mandato Dei licet occidere –––––––––– * Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia , p. 369. 21 † Imago primi saeculi Societatis Jesu, Lib.

If he has received the bribe for passing an unjust sentence, it is probable that he may keep it. . . . This opinion is maintained and defended fifty-eight doctors ” (Jesuits). † We must abstain at present from proceeding further.

Nor are their rules secret, but open to all, for they live in the broad daylight of truth and sincerity. And how about the Jesuits in this respect? Jesuits who belong to the highest category [says again Louis Lambert] have full and absolute liberty of ac tion—even to murder and arson. On the other hand, those Jesuits who are found guilty of the slightest attempt to endanger or compromise the Society of Jesus— are punished mercilessly. They are allowed to write the most heretical books, provided they do not expose the secrets of the Order. 27 And these “secrets” are undeniably of the most terrible and dangerous nature. Compare a f ew of these Christian precepts and rules for entering this Society of “ divine origin,” as claimed for it, with the laws that regulated admission to the secret societies (temple mysteries) of the Pagans. “A brother Jesuit has the right to kill anyone that may prove dangerous to Jesuitism .” 28 “Christian and Catholic sons,” says Stephen Fagundez, “may accuse their fathers of the crime of heresy if the y wish to turn them from the faith, although they may know that their parents will be burned with fire, and put to death for it, as Tolet teaches. . . . .And not only may they refuse them food, if they attempt to turn them from the Catholic faith, but they may also justly kill them . . . . ” * It is well known that Nero, the Emperor, had never dared seek initiation into the pagan Mysteries on account of the murder of Agrippina! Under Section XIV of The Principles of the Jesuits, we find on Homicide the following Christian principles inculcated by Father Henry Henriquez, in Summae Theologiae Moralis Tomus I, Venetiis, 1600 (Ed.

Again, they use their riches lavishly to help them in any project. Their wealth is enormous. When recently expelled from France, they brought so much money with them, some part of which they converted into English Funds, that immediately the latter were raised to par, which the Daily Telegraph pointed out at the time.

Let it be, though Europe will very soon experience, and is already so experiencing, the heavy hand of the latter. Theosophists are slandered and reviled by the Jesuits and their adherents everywhere. They are charged with idolatry and superstition; and yet we read in the same Principles of the Father Jesuits:— “The more true opinion is, tha t all inanimate and irrational things may be legitimately worshipped, ” says Father Gabriel Vasquez, treating of Idolatry. “If the doctrine which we have established be rightly understood, not only may a painted image, and every holy thing set forth by public authority for the worship of God, be properly adored with God as the image of himself; but also any other thing of this world, whether it be inanimate and irrational, or in its nature rational and devoid of danger.” * 34 This is Roman Catholicism, identical and henceforth one with Jesuitism—as shown by th e pastoral of the Cardinal Bishop of Cambrai, and Pope Leo. A precept this, which, whether or not doing honour to the Christian Church, may at least be profitably quoted by any Hindu, Japanese, or any other “heathen” Theosophist, who has not yet given up the belief of his childhood. But we must close.

Then, perhaps, there will be a new invasion of an Atilla from the far East. One day the millions of China and Mongolia, heathen and Mussulman, furnished with every murderous weapon invented by civilization, and forced upon the Celestial of the East, by the infernal spirit of trade and love of lucre of the West, drilled, moreover, to perfection by Christian man-slayers—will pour into and invade decaying Europe like an irresistible torrent.

Considering the importance of this subject, great pains have been taken to secure all available data concerning the various personalities referred to in the text of the present essay. 12 The suppression of the Jesuits in France was connected with the injuries inflicted by the English navy on French commerce in 1755. The Jesuit missionaries held a heavy stake in Martinique. Regular trade was not allowed to them, as they belonged to a religious order; so they sold the products of their mission farms, on which they employed many natives; this was permitted to provide current expenses, and it served to protect the simple, childlike natives from dishonest intermediaries. Père Antoine La Valette, superior of the Martinique mission, engaged in these transactions with considerable success, and went too far along this line. He borrowed money in order to work the vast undeveloped resources of the colony. But on the outbreak of war, ships conveying goods of the estimated value of two million livres were captured, and La Valette suddenly became a bankrupt. His creditors were urged to demand payment from the procurator of the Paris province, but he refused to be held responsible for the debts of an independent mission, offering, however, to negotiate a settlement. The creditors went to the courts, and an order was issued in 1760 obliging the Society to pay. It is then that the Fathers, on the advice of their lawyers, made the mistake of appealing to the Grand ’ chambre of the French Parlement at Paris. Not only did the Parlement support the lower courts, but once having the case in its hands, the Society’s enemies in that assembly determined to strike a decisive blow at the Order. A number of declared enemies of the Society combined together with this objective. Louis XV was weak and the influence of his Court divided; his very able first minister, the Duc de Choiseul, played into the hands of the Parlement, and the royal mistress, Madame de Pompadour, to whom the Jesuits had refused absolution, was their bitter opponent also. The determination of the Parlement of Paris in time wore down all opposition, and a strong attack on the Jesuits was opened by the Abbé Chauvelin, April 17, 1762, who denounced the Constitutions of the Order as the cause of the alleged defalcations of the Jesuits. This was followed by the compte-rendu on the Constitutions, July 3-7, 1762 and further attacks by Chauvelin. After a long conflict with the Crown, the Parlement issued the famous Extraits des Assertions dangereuses et pernicieuses en tout genre, etc., a congeries of passages from Jesuit theologians and canonists, showing them up as having taught all sorts of immoral practices. On the 6th of August, 1762, the final arrêt was issued condemning the Society to extinction, but the king’s intervention resulted in an eight months’ delay. A compromise was suggested 31 0  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS by the Court. If the French Jesuits would stand apart from the Order, under a French vicar, with French"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"customs, the Crown would still protect them. The Jesuits refused. The King’s intervention hindered the execution of the arrêt until April I, 1763. At that time, the Jesuits’ colleges were closed, and the Jesuits were required to renounce their vows under pain of banishment. Very few of them accepted these conditions. In November, 1764, the King signed an edict dissolving the Society throughout his dominions. 13 Antonio de Escobar y Mendoza (1589-1669), Lib er theologiae moralis, viginti quatuor Societatis Jesu Doctoribus reseratus, quem R.P.A. de Escobar et Mendoza in examen confessariorum digestit, addidit, illustravit.

The Bourbon courts of Naples and Parma followed in this the example of France and Spain. Clement XIVth found himself under strong and ever increasing pressure to abolish the Society of Jesus. Around 1769, the Pope commenced open hostilities against the Order. He refused to see its General, Father Ricci, and gradually removed from his entourage their best friends. A congregation of Cardinals hostile to the Order visited the Roman College and had the Fathers expelled. A widespread system of persecution was extended all over Italy. On July 4, 1772, there appeared on the scene a new Spanish ambassador, Joseph Moniño, Count of Florida Blanca, who openly threatened the Pope with a schism in Spain and probably in the other Bourbon states. Caught in the Bourbon intrigues, the Pope found himself unable to oppose Moniño. The latter ransacked the archives of Rome and Spain to supply Clement with facts justifying the promised suppression of the Jesuits. Until the end of 1772, the Pope still found some support 31 2  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS against the Bourbons in King Charles Emmanuel of Sardinia and in the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Bu t Charles died, and Maria Theresa ceased to plead for the maintenance of the Order. At last, in November, 1772, the Pope began the composition of the Brief ( breve ) of abolition, which took seven months to be finished. The Brief known as Dominus ac Redemptor noster, signed on June 8th, bears the date of July 21, 1773, and was made known to the General and his assistants on Aug. 16th. A lengthy trial ensued. This remarkable document issued by Clement XIVth opens with the statement that it is the Pope’s office to secure in the world the unity of mind in the bonds of peace. He must therefore be prepared, for the sake of charity, to uproot and destroy the things most dear to him, whatever pain and bitterness their loss may entail. A long series of precedents are cited for the suppression of religious orders by the Holy See, among them the Templars. After enumerating the principal favours granted to the Society of Jesus by former Popes, he remarks that “the very tenor and terms of the said Apostolic constitutions show that the Society from its earliest days bore the germs of dissensions and jealousies which tore its own members asunder, led them to rise against other religious orders, against the secular clergy and the universities, nay even against the sovereigns who had received them in their states.” Persuaded that the Society of Jesus is no longer able to produce the abundant fruit for which it was instituted, the Pope resolves to “suppress and abolish” the Society, “to annul and abrogate all and each of its offices, functions, and administrations.” The breve proceeds to make regulations for the transference of the authority of the Society’s officers, and concludes with a prohibition to suspend or impede its execution."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"It should be noted that this Brief was not promulgated in the form customary for papal Constitutions intended as laws of the Church; it was not a Bull, but a Brief, i.e., a decree of less binding force and easier of revocation- it was not affixed to the gates of St. Peter’s or in the Campo di Fiore; it was not even communicated in legal form to the Jesuits in Rome, the General and his assistants being the only ones to receive the notification of suppression. After the death of Clement XIVth it was rumoured that he had retracted his famous Brief by a letter of June 29, 1774. The letter it was said, had been entrusted to his confessor to be given to the next Pope. It was published for the first time in 1789, at Zürich, in P. Ph. Wolf’s Allgemeine Geschichte der Jesuiten. Although Pius VI, Clement’s successor, never protested against this statement, the authenticity of the document in question is not sufficiently established.

They elected three Poles successively as Generals, taking the title of Vicars, till on the 7th of March, 1801, Pius VII (Luigi Barnaba Chiaramonti, 1740-1823), the successor of Clement XIVth, granted them the liberty to reconstitute themselves in north Russia. On the 30th of July, 1804, a similar breve restored the Jesuits in the two Sicilies. Finally, in 1814, Pius VIIth, by the Bull Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum, revoked the action of his predecessor and formally restored the Society of Jesus to corporate legal existence. He made no censure, however, of Clement’s action, and no vindication of the Jesuits from the heavy charges that had been levelled against them.

The Constitutions, drafted by Loyola towards the close of his life, and adopted finally by the first General Congregation after his death, in 1558, have never been altered.

One of the most valuable works in this connection is an octavo volume entitled Constitutiones Societatis Jesu, being a scrupulously accurate reprint of the original edition of 1558, together with a collation with the edition printed by the Society at Antwerp in 1702, and a translation; to this is added the text of the three important Papal Bulls of Paul III, Clement XIV and Pius VII. It was published in 1839 by J. C. and F. Rivington, in London. Another valuable work, The Religious State, by Humphrey, London, 1889, carefully outlines the structure of the Jesuit order.

II, No. 10, June, 1888, pp. 311-322] [This remarkable and prophetic study of the workings of karmic law in European history from the fifth century onwards, was written by H.P.B. twenty-six years before the First World War of 1914-18. Though not explicitly so stated, it is abundantly evident from the narrative that H.P.B. depicts the life and sufferings of Emperor Frederick III of Prussia, who was the same individual who earlier inhabited the body of Clovis, King of the Franks. The story was published the very month Emperor Frederick III passed away, after a brief reign of only 99 days. In the January, 1888, issue of Lucifer, H.P.B. had written in her New Year Editorial: “It is not likely that much happiness or prosperity can come to those who are living for the truth under such a dark number as 1888; but still the year is heralded by the glorious star Venus-Lucifer, shining so resplendently that it has been mistaken for that still rarer visitor, the star of Bethlehem. This too, is at hand; and surely something of the Christos spirit must be born upon earth under such conditions.” In the January, 1889, issue of her magazine, she had the following to say, a year later: “A year ago it was stated that 1888 was a dark combination of numbers; it has proved so since. . . Almost every nation was visited by some dire calamity. Prominent among other countries was Germany. It was in 1888 that the Empire reached, virtually the 18th year of its unification. It was during the fatal combination of the four numbers 8 that it lost two of its Emperors, and planted the seeds of many dire Karmic results.” Reference is made here to the death of Emperor William who died March 9, 1888, and of Emperor Frederick III whose death took place June 13th of the same year. In connection with the present story, the following remarks from H.P.B.’s pen should also be borne in mind. They occur in her essay on the nature of Dreams, originally published as an Appendix to the Transactions of the Blavatsky Lodge of the Theosophical Society, Part I (1890), summarising the discussions held at 17, Lansdowne Road, London, on December 20 and 27, 1888. She says: “. . . Our ‘dreams,’ being simply the waking state and actions of the true Self, must be, of course, recorded somewhere. Read ‘Karmic Visions’ in Lucifer, and note the description of the real K ARMIC V ISIONS  319 Ego, sitting as a spectator of the life of the hero, and perhaps something will strike you.” Fr om Section II onwards, in the story of “Karmic Visions,” a very clear distinction is being drawn between the “Soul-Ego” and the “Form” in which it is re-born. It appears that at one point of its life as Clovis, the Soul-Ego inhabiting the “Form” was prompted by the surge of some older savage instincts to the murder of a seeress belonging to the pagan faith, by means of a sword-point piercing her throat. In the embodiment centuries later, as Frederick, the Soul-Ego reaps its karmic fruitage through a “Form” finally becoming voiceless as a result of incurable throat cancer.

I went and plagued her for a reference and would not be satisfied without one. She took the MS. and when I came back for it, I found she had just written the name ‘Alfred Tennyson’ under the verses. Seeing this I was at a loss: for I knew my Tennyson pretty well and was certain that I had never read these lines in any poem of his, nor were they at all in his style. I hunted up my Tennyson, could not find them: consulted every one I could get at—also in vain. Then back I went to H.P.B. and told her all this and said that I was sure these lines could not be Tennyson’s, and I dared not print them with his name attached, unless I could give an exact reference. H.P.B. just damned me and told me to get out and go to Hell. It happened that the Lucifer copy must go to the printers that same day. So I just told her that I should strike out Tennyson’s name when I went, unless she gave me a reference before I started. Just on starting I went to her again, and she handed me a scrap of paper on which were written the words: The Gem— 1831. ‘Well, H.P.B.,’"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"I said, ‘this is worse than ever: for I am dead certain that Tennyson has never written any poem called The Gem. ’ All H.P.B. said was just: Go out and be off.’ “So I went to the British Museum Reading Room and consulted the folk there; but they could give me no help and they one and all agreed that the verses could not be, and were not Tennyson’s. As a last resort, I asked to see Mr. Richard Garnett, the famous Head of the Reading Room in those days, and was taken to him. I explained to him the situation and he also agreed in feeling sure the verses were not Tennyson’s. But after thinking quite a while, he asked me if I had consulted the Catalogue of Periodical Publications. I said no, and asked where that came in. ‘Well,’ said Mr. Garnett, ‘I have a dim recollection that there was once a brief-lived magazine called the Gem. It might be worth your looking it up.’ I did so, and in the volume for the year given in H.P.B.’s note, I found a poem of a few stanzas signed ‘Alfred Tennyson’ and containing the two stanzas quoted by H.P.B. verbatim as she had written them down.

II Time—the landmark of gods and men in the boundless field of Eternity, the murderer of its offspring and of memory in mankind—time moves on with noiseless, incessant step through aeons and ages.... Among millions of other Souls, a Soul-Ego is reborn: for weal or for woe, who knoweth! Captive in its new human Form, it grows with it, and together they become, at last, conscious of their existence. Happy are the years of their blooming youth, unclouded with want or sorrow. Neither knows aught of the Past nor of the Future. For them all is the joyful Present; for the Soul-Ego is unaware that it had ever lived in other human tabernacles, it knows not that it shall be again reborn, and it takes no thought of the morrow. Its Form is calm and content. It has hitherto given its Soul-Ego no heavy troubles. Its happiness is due to the continuous mild serenity of its temper, to the affection it spreads wherever it goes. For it is a noble Form, and its heart is full of benevolence. Never has the Form startled its Soul-Ego with a too-violent shock, or otherwise disturbed the calm placidity of its tenant. Two score of years glide by like one short pilgrimage; a long walk through the sun-lit paths of life, hedged by ever-blooming roses with no thorns. The rare sorrows that befall the twin pair, Form and Soul, appear to them rather like the pale light of the cold northern moon, whose beams throw into a deeper shadow all around the moon-lit objects, than as the blackness of night, the night of hopeless sorrow and despair. Son of a Prince, born to rule himself one day his father’s kingdom; surrounded from his cradle by reverence and honours; deserving of the universal respect and sure of the love of all—what could the Soul-Ego desire more for the Form it dwelt in. 326  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS "},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"And so the Soul-Ego goes on enjoying existence in its tower of strength, gazing quietly at the panorama of life ever changing before its two windows—the two kind blue eyes of a loving and good man. III One day an arrogant and boisterous enemy threatens the father’s kingdom, and the sa vage instincts of the warrior of old awaken in the Soul-Ego. It leaves its dream-land amid the blossoms of life and causes its Ego of clay to draw the soldier’s blade, assuring him it is in defence of his country. Prompting each other to action, they defeat the enemy and cover themselves with glory and pride. They make the haughty foe bite the dust at their feet in supreme humiliation. For this they are crowned by history with the unfading laurels of valour, which are those of success. They make a footstool of the fallen enemy and transform their sire’s little kingdom into a great empire. Satisfied they could achieve no more for the present, they return to seclusion and to the dreamland of their sweet home. For three lustra more the Soul-Ego sits at its usual post, beaming out of its windows on the world around. Over its head the sky is blue and the vast horizons are covered with those seemingly unfading flowers that grow in the sunlight of health and strength. All looks fair as a verdant mead in spring. . . . . . IV But an evil day comes to all in the drama of being. It waits through the life of king and of beggar. It leaves traces on the history of every mortal born from woman and it can neither be scared away, entreated, nor propitiated. Health is a dewdrop that falls from the heavens to vivify the blossoms on earth only during the morn of life, its spring and summer. . . . It has but a short duration and returns from whence it came—the invisible realms.

The worm has gnawed the blossom of health through its heart. The strong body is found stretched one day on the thorny bed of pain. The Soul-Ego beams no longer. It sits still and looks sadly out of what has become its dungeon windows, on the world which is now rapidly being shrouded for it in the funeral"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"palls of suffering. Is it the eve of night eternal which is nearing? V Beautiful are the resorts on the midland sea. An endless line of surf-beaten, black, ru gged rocks stretches, hemmed in between the golden sands of the coast and the deep blue waters of the gulf. They offer their granite breast to the fierce blows of the north-west wind and thus protect the dwellings of the rich that nestle at their foot on the inland side. The half-ruined cottages on the open shore are the insufficient shelter of the poor. Their squalid bodies are often crushed under the walls torn and washed down by wind and angry wave. But they only follow the great law of the survival of the fittest. Why should they be protected? Lovely is the morning when the sun dawns with golden amber tints and its first rays kiss the cliffs of the beautiful shore. Glad is the song of the lark, as, emerging from its warm nest of herbs, it drinks the morning dew from the deep flower-cups; when the tip of the rosebud thrills under the caress of the first sunbeam, and earth and heaven smile in mutual greeting Sad is the Soul-Ego alone as it gazes on awakening nature from the high couch opposite the large bay-window. How calm is the approaching noon as the shadow creeps steadily on the sundial towards the hour of rest! 328  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS No w the hot sun begins to melt the clouds in the limpid air and the last shreds of the morning mist that lingers on the tops of the distant hills vanish in it. All nature is prepared to rest at the hot and lazy hour of midday. The feathered tribes cease their song; their soft, gaudy wings droop, and they hang their drowsy heads, seeking refuge from the burning heat. A morning lark is busy nestling in the bordering bushes under the clustering flowers of the pomegranate and the sweet bay of the Mediterranean. The active songster has become voiceless. “Its voice will resound as joyfully again to-morrow!” sighs the Soul-Ego, as it listens to the dying buzzing of the insects on the verdant turf. . “Shall ever mine?” And now the flower-scented breeze hardly stirs the languid heads of the luxuriant plants. A solitary palm-tree, growing out of the cleft of a moss-covered rock, next catches the eye of the Soul-Ego. Its once upright, cylindrical trunk has been twisted out of shape and half-broken by the nightly blasts of the north-west winds. And as it stretches wearily its drooping feathery arms, swayed to and fro in the blue pellucid air, its body trembles and threatens to break in two at the first new gust that may arise. “And then, the severed part will fall into the sea, and the once stately palm will be no more,” soliloquises the Soul-Ego as it gazes sadly out of its windows. Everything returns to life in the cool, old bower at hour of sunset.

Birds and insects chirrup and buzz their last evening hymns around the tall and still powerful Form, as it paces slowly and wearily along the gravel walk. And now its heavy gaze falls wistfully on the azure bosom of the tranquil sea. The gulf sparkles like a gem-studded carpet of blue-velvet in the farewell dancing sunbeams, and smiles like a thoughtless, drowsy child, weary of tossing about. Further on, calm and serene in its perfidious beauty, the open sea stretches far and wide the smooth mirror of its cool waters—salt and bitter as human tears. K ARMIC V ISIONS   329 It lies in its treacherous repose like a gorgeous, sleeping monster, watching over the unfathomed mystery of its dark abysses.

Its dissolution will be announced by millions of trumpet voices. Kings, princes and the mighty ones of the earth will be present at its obsequies, or will send their representatives with sorrowful faces and condoling messages to those left behind.... “One point gained, over those ‘uncoffined and unknown’,” is the bitter reflection of the Soul-Ego. Thus glides past one day after the other; and as swift-winged Time urges his flight, every vanishing hour destroying some thread in the tissue of life, the Soul-Ego is gradually transformed in its views of things and men. Flitting between two eternities, far away from its birthplace, solitary among its crowd of physicians, and attendants, the Form is drawn with every day nearer to its Spirit-Soul. Another light unapproached and unapproachable in days of joy, softly descends upon the weary prisoner. It sees now that which it had never perceived before. . . . .

Heaven and earth are plunged in sleep, but their souls are awake, and they confabulate, whispering one to the other mysteries unspeakable. It is then that the occult side of Nature lifts her dark veils for us, and reveals secrets we would vainly seek to extort from her during the day. The firmament, so distant, so far away from earth, now seems to approach and bend over her. The sidereal meadows exchange embraces with their more humble sisters of the earth—the daisy-decked valleys and the green slumbering fields. The heavenly dome falls prostrate into the arms of the great quiet sea; and the millions of stars that stud the former peep into and bathe in every lakelet and pool. To the grief-furrowed soul those twinkling orbs are the eyes of angels. They look down with ineffable pity on the suffering of mankind.

But— “When silently we watch the bed, by the taper’s flickering light, W hen all we love is fading fast—how terrible is night. . . .” VII Another day is added to the series of buried days. The far green hills, and the fragrant bo ughs of the pomegranate blossom have melted in the mellow shadows of the night, and both sorrow and joy are plunged in the lethargy of soul-resting sleep. Every noise has died out in the royal gardens, and no voice or sound is heard in that overpowering stillness. Swift-winged dreams descend from the laughing stars in motley crowds, and landing upon the earth disperse among mortals and immortals, amid animals and men. They hover over the sleepers, each attracted by its affinity and kind; dreams of joy and hope, balmy and innocent visions, terrible and awesome sights seen with sealed K ARMIC V ISIONS   331 ey es, sensed by the soul; some instilling happiness and consolation, others causing sobs to heave the sleeping bosom, tears and mental torture, all and one preparing unconsciously to the sleepers their waking thoughts of the morrow. Even in sleep the Soul-Ego finds no rest. Hot and feverish its body tosses about in restless agony. For it, the time of happy dreams is now a vanished shadow, a long bygone recollection.

The sight of his snorting steed pleases him no longer. The recollections of guns and banners wrested from the enemy; of cities razed, of trenches, cannons and tents, of an array of conquered spoils now stirs but little his national pride. Such thoughts move him no more, and ambition has become powerless to awaken in his aching heart the haughty recognition of any valorous deed of chivalry. Visions of another kind now haunt his weary days and sleepless nights . . . . What he now sees is a throng of bayonets clashing against each other in mist of smoke and blood; thousands of mangled corpses covering the ground, torn and cut to shreds by the murderous weapons devised by science and civilization, blessed to success by the servants of his God.

He sees and feels the torture of the fallen millions, who die after long hours of terrible mental and physical agony; who expire in forest and plain, in stagnant ditches by the road-side; in pools of blood under a sky made black with smoke. His eyes are once more rivetted to the torrents of blood, every drop of which represents a tear of despair, a heart-rent cry, a life-long sorrow. He hears again the thrilling sighs of desolation, and the shrill cries ringing through mount, forest and valley. He sees the old mothers who have lost the light of their souls; families, the hand that fed them. He beholds widowed young wives thrown on the wide, cold world, and beggared orphans wailing in the streets by the thousands. He finds the young daughters of his bravest old soldiers exchanging their mourning garments for the gaudy frippery of prostitution, and the Soul-Ego shudders in the sleeping Form. . . .

But as the rainbow is not always the dispeller of the storm-clouds but often only a refraction of the setting sun on a passing cloud, so the moments of dreamy hope are generally followed by hours of still blacker despair. Why, oh why, thou mocking Nemesis, hast thou thus purified and enlightened, among all the sovereigns on this earth, him, whom thou hast made helpless, speechless and powerless? Why hast thou kindled the flame of holy brotherly love for man in the breast of one whose heart already feels the approach of the icy hand of death and decay, whose strength is steadily deserting him and whose very life is melting away like foam on the crest of a breaking wave? And now the hand of Fate is upon the couch of pain. The hour for the fulfilment of nature’s law has struck at last. The old Sire is no more; the younger man is henceforth a monarch. Voiceless and helpless, he is nevertheless a potentate, the autocratic master of millions of subjects. Cruel Fate has erected a throne for him over an open grave, and beckons him to glory and to power. Devoured by suffering, he finds himself suddenly crowned. The wasted Form is snatched from its warm nest amid the palm groves and the roses; it is whirled from balmy south to the frozen north, where waters harden into crystal groves and “waves on waves in solid mountains rise”; whither he now speeds to reign and—speeds to die.

It is now a giant, a Jotun, who rushes into Muspelsheim, where Surtur rules with his flaming sword. It battles fearlessly against a host of monstrous animals, and puts them to flight with a single wave of its mighty hand. Then it sees itself in the Northern Mistworld, it penetrates under the guise of a brave bowman into Helheim, the Kingdom of the Dead, where a Black-Elf reveals to him a series of its lives and their mysterious concatenation. “Why does man suffer?” enquires the Soul-Ego. “Because he would become one,” is the mocking answer. Forthwith, the Soul-Ego stands in the presence of the holy goddess, Saga. She sings to it of the valorous deeds of the Germanic heroes, of their virtues and their vices. She shows the soul the mighty warriors fallen by the hands of many of its past Forms, on battlefield, as also in the sacred security of home. It sees itself under the personages of maidens, and of women, of young and old men, and of children.... It feels itself dying more than once in those forms. It expires as a hero-Spirit, and is led by the pitying Walkyries from the bloody battlefield back to the abode of Bliss under the shining foliage of Walhalla. It heaves its last sigh in 336  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS an other form, and is hurled on to the cold, hopeless plane of remorse. It closes its innocent eyes in its last sleep, as an infant, and is forthwith carried along by the beauteous Elves of Light into another body—the doomed generator of Pain and Suffering. In each case the mists of death are dispersed, and pass from the eyes of the Soul-Ego, no sooner does it cross the Black Abyss that separates the Kingdom of the Living from the Realm of the Dead. Thus “Death” becomes but a meaningless word for it, a vain sound. In every instance the beliefs of the Mortal take objective life and shape for the Immortal, as soon as it spans the Bridge. Then they begin to fade, and disappear. . . . “What is my Past?” enquires the Soul-Ego of Urd, the eldest of the Norn sisters. “Why do I suffer?” A long parchment is unrolled in her hand, and reveals a long series of mortal beings, in each of whom the Soul-Ego recognises one of its dwellings. When it comes to the last but one, it sees a blood-stained hand doing endless deeds of cruelty and treachery, and it shudders. . . . . . . .

He feels a wave of joy and bliss in him, and seems to know why he is happy. He is suddenly transported into what looks a fairylike Hall, lit with most glowing lights and built of materials, the like of which he had never seen before. He perceives the heirs and descendants of all the monarchs of the globe gathered in that Hall in one happy family. They wear no longer the insignia of royalty, but, as he seems to know, those who are the reigning Princes, reign by virtue of their personal merits. It is the greatness of heart, the nobility of character, their superior qualities of observation, wisdom, love of Truth and Justice, that have raised them to the dignity of heirs to the Thrones, of Kings and Queens. The crowns, by authority and the grace of God, have been thrown off, and they now rule by “the grace of divine humanity,” chosen unanimously by recognition of their fitness to rule, and the reverential love of their voluntary subjects. All around seems strangely changed. Ambition, grasping greediness or envy—miscalled Patriotism— exist no longer. Cruel selfishness has made room for just altruism, and cold indifference to the wants of the millions no longer finds favour in the sight of the favoured few. 338  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" Useless luxury, sham pretences—social and religious—all has disappeared.

The first and earliest Church Fathers, such as Clement of Rome, Irenaeus, Hippolytus, etc., etc., wrote in the Greek language. The first Popes were Greeks, not Italians, the very name “Pope” being a Greek not a Latin name, “ Papa ” meaning father. Every Greek priest is called to this day “ papa, ” and every Russian priest “pope.” The first quarrels which led to the separation of the Church, into the Latin and the Greek or Eastern, did not take place earlier than the IXth century, namely, in 865, under the Patriarch Photius; while the final separation occurred only in the XIth century, when the Latin Church proclaimed herself with her usual arrogance the one universal Apostolic Church and all others Schismatics and Heretics!

Si vous trouvez qu’elle a le toucher rude,—et je ne suis pas le seul à le constater,—c’est que «vous avez la peau bien sensible».

Oui, il y a deux théosophies—l’une, universelle (la nôtre), l’autre, sectaire (la vôtre). Oui, il y a deux Kabbales, l’une compilée par Simon Ben Iochai dans le Zohar au IIe siècle (nous disons le premier), qui est la vraie Kabbale des Initiés qui est perdue et dont l’original se trouve dans le Livre Chaldéen des Nombres; et l’autre, celle qui existe dans les traductions latines de vos bibliothèques, Kabbale dénaturée au XIII e siècle par Mo ïse de Léon, pseudographe composé par cet Israélite espagnol, avec l ’ aide et sous l ’ inspiration directe des chrétiens de la Syrie et de la Chaldée, sur les traditions conservées dans les Midraschim et les fragments restant du vrai Zohar. Et voici pourquoi on y retrouve la Trinité et autres dogmes chrétiens, et que les Rabbins qui n’ont pas eu la chance d’avoir conservé dans leurs familles des chapitres de la Kabbale authentique ne veulent rien savoir de celle de Moïse de Léon (celle de Rosenroth et C ie ) dont ils rient. Vo yez plutôt Munk ce qu’il en dit. Le mysticisme et la Kabbale sur lesquels M. l’abbé et les autres reposent leurs données leur viennent donc de Moïse de Léon, comme leur système des Sephiroth leur vient du Tholuck, l.c., pages 24 et 31, leur grande autorité. Ce fut Hây Gaôn (mort en 1038) qui le premier développa le système Sephirothal comme nous l’avons maintenant, c’est-à-dire un système qui, comme le Zohar et autres livres kabbalistiques, a été filtré au moyen âge, dans la Gnose déjà défigurée par les Chrétiens des premiers siècles.—H.

We mention it with circumspection, but Madame Blavatsky is rather embarrassing and one hardly knows exactly what course to adopt with her. If you imagine that she has treated you roughly—and I am not the only one to state this—it is because “you have such a sensitive skin.” You are mistaking for smacks the caresses of a hand whose kindness is so Buddhistical that it “would not even strike a dog to stop him from barking.” The lightest puff from her “appears to you as a squall” and what is but a zephyr seems a cold blast to you, La Fontaine’s poor little reed that you are. Well, let us proceed. Such misconceptions may be understood, if need be; but what cannot possibly be conceived is how the same person may be, in the eyes of Madame Blavatsky, at one and the same time “a fidei defensor ,” a catholic priest, a simple curé, about whom one greatly regrets disturbing oneself, and an Abbé who has “thrown his cap of an orthodox and papistical ecclesiastic to the windmills,” and who, “ignoring the true esotericism of the BrâhmaŠas and the Buddhists, of the Pagan and Christian Gnostics, as well as of the authentic Chaldean Kabalah, and knowing nothing of the doctrines of the Theosophists . . . . . has fabricated for himself a Christianity of his own, an Esotericism sui generis .” She adds: “I confess that I do not understand him.” I can well believe it! Neither I nor anyone else in the world, dear Madame, will ever comprehend how the same man could be at the same time “a fidei defensor ,” a poor curé about whom it is not worth being disturbed, and an Abbé deprived of his “ orthodox and papistical biretta.” These terms clash among themselves as light clashes with darkness.* –––––––––– * M ay it not be that these terms trace their origin to the letters themselves, to the “Notes” of Monsieur Roca?

Yet she has kindly acknowledged that I have the meekness, not of a Christian, because the Christians, she says, “are neither humble nor gentle in their polemics,”—but of a Buddhist. She ought then to be satisfied—but not so. She takes it ill that I should speak as a Buddhist. That language in my mouth has no value to her. My homage produces on her the effect “of a greasy pole erected to serve as a support for Christian gewgaws attached to it in profusion, by an apostolic and Roman hand [good! for this occasion I have become the simple priest again], or of a Hindû-Theosophic doll bedecked with Popish amulets”— Popish , you understand!

Listen to the divine utterance: “And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man [the Man-God], it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost [the Christ-Spirit], it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world [the present era, which is closing], neither in the world to come [the era which is opening in our day].” † It is indeed remarkable that these words were repeated by the Four Evangelists. ‡ The reason is that they are of capital importance. The version according to St. Mark is the most liberal of all. It declares that were the things said against the Son of Man blasphemies, these blasphemies would be forgiven, if they were not addressed to the Holy Ghost ( loc. cit. ) .

What I fear for Madame Blavatsky, is that the discussions she has had with Christian priests, and which must have been extremely lively on both sides, since she says she paid “for having known the said priests,” may have greatly contributed to falsify her ideas about Jesus Christ. We must admit that many among us, ministers of his meek and lowly Gospel, hardly shine in our age with a profound understanding of the Arcanes of Christ, and that our tolerance has not always been—indeed far from it—-in conformity with that of his heart. It is certain, for example, that the terrible Christ of the Inquisition, our own work, was not at all designed to render the true Christ agreeable or to recommend him, the Christ of the Sermon on the Mount and of the vision of Tabor.* It is equally certain that our own Christ, the one of the priests, is held in abomination, alas, by many people.

At the word “Pentacle,” we read as follows: Pentacle—a figure composed of two equilateral triangles, intersecting so as to form a SIX - pointed star, u sed in ornamental art, and also with superstitious import by the astrologers, etc. This (Fairholt’s) definition is preceded by saying that pentacle is a word from Greek PENTE , five— which every school boy knows.

For, with as much “deference” as shown by The Path to Lucifer, Lucifer ventures to point out to The Path that, according to old Kabalistic phraseology, a pantacle is “ any magic figure intended to produce results.” Therefore if anyone is to be taken to task for overlooking “the grave etymological objections to the definition of pentacle as a six-pointed star,” it is the great Professors who have just revised Webster ’ s Dictionary, and not Lucifer.

They have no distinct personal form in which to reveal themselves. Student.— How am I to understand that, in view of the instances given by Bulwer Lytton and others of appearances of elementals in certain forms? Sage .—The shape given to or assumed by any elemental is always subjective in its origin. It is produced by the person who sees, and who, in order to be more sensible of the elemental’s presence, has unconsciously given it a form. Or it may be due to a collective impression on many individuals, resulting in the assumption of a definite shape which is the result of the combined impressions. Student .—Is this how we may accept as true the story of Luther’s seeing the devil? Sage .—Yes. Luther from his youth had imagined a personal devil, the head of the"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"fraternity of wicked ones, who had a certain specific form This instantly clothed the elementals that Luther evoked, either through intense enthusiasm or from disease, with the old image reared and solidified in his mind; and he called it the Devil. Student .—That reminds me of a friend who told me that in his youth he saw the conventional devil walk out of the fire place and pass across the room, and that ever since he believed the devil had an objective existence. Sage.— -In the same way also you can understand the extraordinary occurrences at Salem in the United States, when hysterical and mediumistic women and children saw the devil and also various imps of different shapes. Some of these gave the victims information. They were all elementals, and took their illusionary forms from the imaginations and memory of the poor people who were afflicted. Student .—But there are cases where a certain form always appears. Such as a small, curiously-dressed w oman vçho had never existed in the imagination of those seeing her; and other regularly recurring appearances. How were those produced, since the persons never had such a picture before them? Sage .—These pictures are found in the aura of the 400-B  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS pe rson, and are due to pre-natal impressions. Each child emerges into life the possessor of pictures floating about and clinging to it, derived from the mother; and thus you can go back an enormous distance in time for these pictures, all through the long line of your descent. It is a part of the action of the same law which causes effects upon a child’s body through influences acting on the mother during gestation.* Student.— In order, then, to know the cause of any such appearance, one must be able to look back, not only into the person’s present life, but also into the ancestor’s past? Sage .—Precisely. And for that reason an occultist is not hasty in giving his opinion on these particular facts. He can only state the general law, for a life might be wasted in needless investigation of an unimportant past. You can see that there would be no justification for going over a whole lifetime’s small affairs in order to tell a person at what time or juncture an image was projected before his mind. Thousands of such impressions are made every year. That they are not developed into memory does not prove their non-existence. Like the unseen picture upon the photographer’s sensitive plate, they lie awaiting the hour of development. Student .—In what way should I figure to myself the essence of an elemental and its real mode of existence? Sage .—You should think of them as centers of energy only, that act always in accordance with the laws of the plane of nature to which they belong. Student .—Is it not just as if we w-ere to say that gunpowder is an elemental and will invariably explode when lighted?

Sage .—Yes, and not only that, but at the same time, penetrating that class of elementals, there may be another class which float not only through rocks, trees, and men, but also through the first of the classes referred to. Student .—Do they perceive these objects obstructive for us, through which they thus float? Sage .—No, generally they do not. In exceptional cases they do, and even then never with the same sort of cognition that we have. For them the objects have no existence. A large block of stone or iron offers for them no limits or density. It may, however, make an impression on them by way of change of color or sound, but not by way of density or obstruction. Student .—Is it not something like this, that a current of electricity passes through a hard piece of copper wire, while it will not pass through an unresisting space of air? Sage .—That serves to show that the thing which is dense to one form of energy may be open to another. Continuing your illustration, we see that man can pass through air but is stopped by metal. So that “hardness” for us is not “hardness” for electricity. Similarly, that which may stop an elemental is not a body that we call hard, but something which for us is intangible and invisible, but presents to them an adamantine front.

Student.— What does Occultism teach in regard to man, broadly speaking? Sage .—That he is the highest product of evolution, and hence has in him a centre or focus corresponding to each centre of force or power in the universe. He therefore has as many centres or foci for force, power, and knowledge as there are such in the greater world about and within. Student .—Do you mean to include also the ordinary run of men, or is it the exceptions you refer to? Sage .—I include every human being, and that will reach from the lowest to the very highest, both those we know and those beyond us who are suspected as being in existence. Although we are accustomed to confine the term “human” to this earth, it is not correct to confine that sort of being to this plane or globe, because other planets have beings the same as ours in essential power and nature and possibility. Student .—Please explain a little more particularly what you mean by our having centres or foci in us. Sage .—Electricity is a most powerful force not fully known to modern science, yet used very much. The nervous, physical, and mental systems of man acting together are able to produce the same force exactly, and in a finer as well as subtler way and to as great a degree as the most powerful dynamo, so that the force might be used to kill, to alter, to move, or otherwise change any object or condition. This is the “vril” described by Bulwer Lytton in his Coming Race. Nature exhibits to our eyes the power of drawing into one place with fixed limits any amount of material so as to produce the smallest natural object or the very largest. Out of the air she takes what is already there, and by compressing C ONVERSATIONS O N O CCULTISM  400-E it into the limits of tree or animal form makes it visible to our material eyes. This is the power of condensing into what may be known as the ideal limits, that is, into the limits of the form which is ideal. Man has this same power, and can, when he knows the laws and the proper centres of force in himself, do precisely what Nature does. He can thus make visible and material what was before ideal and invisible by filling the ideal form with the matter condensed from the air. In his case the only difference from Nature is that he does quickly what she brings about slowly. Among natural phenomena there is no present illustration of telepathy good for our use.

This is a natural power, and being well-understood may be used by one mind to convey to another, no matter how far away or what be the intervening obstacle, any idea or thought. In natural things we can take for that the vibration of the chord which can cause all other chords of the same length to vibrate similarly. This is a branch of Occultism, a part of which is known to the modern investigator. But it is also one of the most useful and one of the greatest powers we have. To make it of service many things have to combine. While it is used every day in common life in the average way—for men are each moment telepathically communicating with each other—to do it in perfection, that is, against obstacle and distance, is perfection of occult art. Yet it will be known one day even to the common world. Student.— Is there any object had in view by Nature which man should also hold before him? Sage .—Nature ever works to turn the inorganic or the lifeless or the non-intelligent and non-conscious into the organic, the intelligent, the conscious; and this should be the aim of man also. In her great movements Nature seems to cause destruction, but that is only for the purpose of construction. The rocks are dissolved into earth, elements combine to bring on change, but there is the ever onward march of progress in evolution. Nature is not destructive 400-F  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS of either thing or time, she is constructive. Man should be the same. And as a free moral agent he should work to that end, and not to procuring gratification merely nor for waste in any department. Student.— Is Occultism of truth or of falsehood, is it selfish or unselfish; or is it part one and part the other? Sage .—Occultism is colorless, and only when used by man for the one side or the other is it good or bad. Bad Occultism, or that which is used for selfish ends, is not false, for it is the same as that which is for good ends. Nature is two-sided, negative and positive, good and bad, light and dark, hot and cold, spirit and matter. The Black magician is as powerful in the matter of phenomena as the White, but in the end all the trend of Nature will go to destroy the black and save the white. But what you should understand is that the false man and the true can both be occultists. The words of the Christian teacher Jesus will give the rule for judgment: “By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?” Occultism is the general, all-inclusive term, the differentiating terms are White and Black; the same forces are used by both, and similar laws, for there are no special laws in this universe for any special set of workers in Nature’s secrets. But the path of the untruthful and the wicked, while seemingly easy at first, is hard at last, for the black workers are the friends of no one, they are each against the other as soon as interest demands, and that may be any time. It is said that final annihilation of the personal soul awaits those who deal in the destructive side of Nature’s hall of experience."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Student .—Where should I look for the help I need in the right life, the right study? Sage .—Within yourself is the light that lighteth every man who cometh here. The light of the Higher Self and of the Mahâtma are not different from each other. Unless you find your Self, how can you understand Nature? Student .—What is the effect of trying to develop the power of seeing in the astral light before a person is initiated? C ONVERSATIONS O N O CCULTISM  400-G Sa ge.— Seeing in the astral light is not done through Manas, but through the senses, and hence has to do entirely with sense-perception removed to a plane different from this, but more illusionary. The final perceiver or judge of perception is in Manas, in the Self; and therefore the final tribunal is clouded by the astral perception if one is not so far trained or initiated as to know the difference and able to tell the true from the false. Another result is a tendency to dwell on this subtle sense-perception, which at last will cause an atrophy of Manas for the time being. This makes the confusion all the greater, and will delay any possible initiation all the more or forever. Further, such seeing is in the line of phenomena, and adds to the confusion of the Self which is only beginning to understand this life; by attempting the astral another element of disorder is added by more phenomena due to another plane, thus mixing both sorts up. The Ego must find its basis and not be swept off hither and thither. The constant reversion of images and ideas in the astral light, and the pranks of the elementals there, unknown to us as such and only seen in effects, still again add to the confusion. To sum it up, the real danger from which all others flow or follow is in the confusion of the Ego by introducing strange things to it before the time. Student .—How is one to know when he gets real occult information from the Self within? Sage .—Intuition must be developed and the matter judged from the true philosophical basis, for if it is contrary to true general rules it is wrong. It has to be known from a deep and profound analysis by which we find out what is from egotism alone and what is not; if it is due to egotism, then it is not from the Spirit and is untrue. The power to know does not come from book-study nor from mere philosophy, but mostly from the actual practice of altruism in deed, word, and thought; for that practice purifies the covers of the soul and permits that light to shine down into the brain-mind. As the brain-mind is the receiver in the waking state, it has to be purified from sense-perccption, and the truest way to do this is by combining philosophy with the highest outward and inward virtue. 400-H  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS St udent.— Tell me some ways by which intuition is to be developed."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Sage .—First of all by giving it exercise, and second by not using it for purely personal ends. Exercise means that it must be followed through mistakes and bruises until from sincere attempts at use it comes to its own strength. This does not mean that we can do wrong and leave the results, but that after establishing conscience on a right basis by following the golden rule, we give play to the intuition and add to its strength. Inevitably in this at first we will make errors, but soon if we are sincere it will grow brighter and make no mistake. We should add the study of the works of those who in the past have trodden this path and found out what is the real and what is not. They say the Self is the only reality. The brain must be given larger views of life, as by the study of the doctrine of reincarnation, since that gives a limitless field to the possibilities in store. We must not only be unselfish, but must do all the duties that Karma has given us, and thus intuition will point cut the road of duty and the true path of life. Student .—Are there any Adepts in America or Europe? Sage .—Yes, there are and always have been. But they have for the present kept themselves hidden from the publice gaze. The real ones have a wide work to do in many departments of life and in preparing certain persons who have a future work to do. Though their influence is wide they are not suspected, and that is the way they want to work for the present. There are some also who are at work with certain individuals in some of the aboriginal tribes in America, as among those are Egos who are to do still more work in another incarnation, and they must be prepared for it now. Nothing is omitted by these Adepts. In Europe it is the same way, each sphere of work being governed by the time and the place. Student .—What is the meaning of the five-pointed star? Sage .—It is the symbol of the human being who is not an Adept, but is now on the plane of the animal nature as to his life-thoughts and development inside. Hence it is the C ONVERSATIONS O N O CCULTISM  40-I sy mbol of the race. Upside down it means death or symbolizes that. It also means, when upside down, the other or dark side. It is at the same time the cross endowed with the power of mind, that is, man. Student.— Is there a four-pointed star symbol? Sage .—Yes. That is the symbol of the next kingdom below man, and pertains to the animals. The right kind of clairvoyant can see both the five- and the four-pointed star. It is all produced by the intersections of the lines or currents of the astral light emanating from the person or being. The four-pointed one means that the being having but it has not as yet developed Manas. Student .—Has the mere figure of a five-pointed star any power in itself? Sage .—It has some, but very little. You see it is used by all sorts of people for trademarks and the like, and for the purposes of organizations, yet no result follows. It must be actually used by the mind to be of any force or value. If so used, it carries with it the whole power of the person to whom it may belong."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"Student .—Why is the sword so much spoken of in practical Occultism by certain writers? Sage .—Many indeed of these writers merely repeat what they have read. But there is a reason, just as in warfare the sword has more use for damage than a club. The astral light corresponds to water. If you try to strike in or under water with a club, it will be found that there is but little result, but a sharp knife will cut almost as well under water as out of it. The friction is less. So in the astral light a sword used on that plane has more power to cut than a club has, and an elemental for that reason will be more easily damaged by a sword than by a club or a stone. But all of this relates to things that are of no right value to the true student, and are indulged in only by those who work in dark magic or foolishly by those who do not quite know what they do. It is certain that he who uses the sword or the club will be at last hurt by it. And the lesson to be drawn is that we must seek for the true Self that knows all Occultism 400-J  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS a n d all truth, and has in itself the protecting shield from all dangers. That is what the ancient Sages sought and found, and that is what should be striven after by us. –––––––––– Student–– Is there not some attitude of mind which one should in truth assume in order to understand the occult in Nature? Sage .—Such attitude of mind must be attained as will enable one to look into the realities of things. The mind must escape from the mere formalities and conventions of life, even though outwardly one seems to obey all of them, and should be firmly established on the truth that Man is a copy of the Universe and has in himself a portion of the Supreme Being. To the extent this is realized will be the clearness of perception of truth. A realization of this leads inevitably to the conclusion that all other men and beings are united with us, and this removes the egotism which is the result of the notion of separateness. When the truth of Unity is understood, then distinctions due to comparisons made like the Pharisee’s, that one is better than his neighbor, disappear from the mind, leaving it more pure and free to act. Student .—What would you point out as a principal foe to the mind’s grasping of truth? Sage .—The principal foe of a secondary nature is what was once called phantasy; that is, the reappearance of thoughts and images due to recollection or memory. Memory is an important power, but mind in itself is not memory. Mind is restless and wandering in its nature, and must be controlled. Its wandering disposition is necessary or stagnation would result. But it can be controlled and fixed upon an object or idea. Now as we are constantly looking at and hearing of new things, the natural restlessness of the mind becomes prominent when we set about pinning it down. Then memory of many objects, things, subjects, duties, persons, circumstances, and affairs brings up before it the various pictures and thoughts belonging to them. After these the mind at once tries to go, and we find"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"ourselves C ONVERSATIONS O N O CCULTISM  400-K wa ndering from the point. It must hence follow that the storing of a multiplicity of useless and surely-recurring thoughts is an obstacle to the acquirement of truth. And this obstacle is the very one peculiar to our present style of life. Student.— Can you mention some of the relations in which the sun stands to us and nature in respect to Occultism? Sage .—It has many such, and all important. But I would draw your attention first to the greater and more comprehensive. The sun is the center of our solar system. The life-energies of that system come to it through the sun, which is a focus or reflector for the spot in space where the real center is. And not only comes mere life through that focus, but also much more that is spiritual in its essence. The sun should therefore not only be looked at with the eye but thought of by the mind. It represents to the world what the Higher Self is to the man. It is the soul-center of the world with its six companions, as the Higher Self is the center for the six principles of man. So it supplies to those six principles of the man many spiritual essences and powers. He should for that reason think of it and not confine himself to gazing at it. So far as it acts materially in light, heat, and gravity, it will go on of itself, but man as a free agent must think upon it in order to gain what benefit can come only from his voluntary action in thought. Student .—Will you refer to some minor one? Sage .—Well, we sit in the sun for heat and possible chemical effects. But if at the same time that we do this we also think on it as the sun in the sky and of its possible essential nature, we thereby draw from it some of its energy not otherwise touched. This can also be done on a dark day when clouds obscure the sky, and some of the benefit thus be obtained. Natural mystics, learned and ignorant, have discovered this for themselves here and there, and have often adopted the practice. But it depends, as you see, upon the mind. Student .—Does the mind actually do anything when it takes up a thought and seeks for more light? 400-L  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS Sa ge.— It actually does. A thread, or a finger, or a long darting current flies out from the brain to seek for knowledge. It goes in all directions and touches all other minds it can reach so as to receive the information if possible. This is telepathically, so to say, accomplished. There are no patents on true knowledge of philosophy nor copyrights in that realm. Personal rights of personal life are fully respected save by potential black magicians who would take anyone’s property. But general truth belongs to all, and when the unseen"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"messenger from one mind arrives and touches the real mind of another, that other gives up to it what it may have of truth about general subjects. So the mind’s finger or wire flies until it gets the thought or seed-thought from the other and makes it its own. But our modern competitive system and selfish desire for gain and fame is constantly building a wall around people’s minds to everyone’s detriment. Student .—Do you mean that the action you describe is natural, usual, and universal, or only done by those who know how and are conscious of it? Sage .—It is universal and whether the person is aware or not of what is going on. Very few are able to perceive it in themselves, but that makes no difference. It is done always. When you sit down to earnestly think on a philosophical or ethical matter, for instance, your mind flies off, touching other minds, and from them you get varieties of thought. If you are not well-balanced and psychically purified, you will often get thoughts that are not correct. Such is your Karma and the Karma of the race. But if you are sincere and try to base yourself on right philosophy, your mind will naturally reject wrong notions. You can see in this how it is that systems of thought are made and kept going, even though foolish, incorrect, or pernicious. Student .—What mental attitude and aspiration are the best safeguards in this, as likely to aid the mind in these searches to reject error and not let it fly into the brain? Sage .—Unselfishness, Altruism in theory and practice, desire to do the will of the Higher Self which is the “Father C ONVERSATIONS O N O CCULTISM  400-M in Heaven”, devotion to the human race. Subsidiary to these are discipline, correct thinking, and good education. Student.— Is the uneducated man, then, in a worse condition? Sage .—Not necessarily so. The very learned are so immersed in one system that they reject nearly all thoughts not in accord with preconceived notions. The sincere ignorant one is often able to get the truth but not able to express it. The ignorant masses generally hold in their minds the general truths of Nature, but are limited as to expression. And most of the best discoveries of scientific men have been obtained in this sub-conscious telepathic mode. Indeed, they often arrive in the learned brain from some obscure and so-called ignorant person, and then the scientific discoverer makes himself famous because of his power of expression and means for giving it out. Student .—Does this bear at all upon the work of the Adepts of all good Lodges? Sage .—It does. They have all the truths that could be desired, but at the same time are able to guard them from the seeking minds of those who are not yet ready to use them properly, and then touch his cogitating mind with a picture of what he seeks. He then has a “flash” of thought in the line of his deliberations, as many of them have admitted. He gives it out to the world, becomes famous, and the world wiser.

Student .—How about the Adepts knowing what is going on in the world of thought, in the West, for instance? Sage .—They have only to voluntarily and consciously connect their minds with those of the dominant thinkers of the day to at once discover what has been or is being worked out in thought and to review it all. This they constantly do, and as constantly incite to further elaborations or changes 400-N  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS by throwing out the suggestion in the mental plane so that seeking and receptive minds may use it. –––––––––– Student.— Are there any rules, binding on all, in white magic or good occultism? I mean rules similar to the ten commandments of the Christians, or the rules for the protection of life, liberty, and property recognized by human law. Sage .––There are such rules of the most stringent character, the breaking of which is never wiped out save by expiation. Those rules are not made up by some brain or mind, but flow from the laws of nature, of mind, and of soul. Hence they are impossible of nullification. One may break them and seem to escape for a whole life or for more than a life; but the very breaking of them sets in motion at once other causes which begin to make effects, and most unerringly those effects at last react on the violator. Karma here acts as it does elsewhere, and becomes a Nemesis who, though sometimes slow, is fate itself in its certainty. Student .—It is not, then, the case that when an occultist violates a rule some other adept or agent starts out like a detective or policeman and brings the culprit to justice at a bar or tribunal such as we sometimes read of in the imaginative works of mystical writers or novelists? Sage .––No, there is no such pursuit. On the contrary, all the fellow-adepts or students arc but too willing to aid the offender, not in escaping punishment, but in sincerely trying to set counteracting causes in motion for the good of all. For the sin of one reacts on the whole human family. If, however, the culprit does not wish to do the amount of counteracting good, he is merely left alone to the law of nature, which is in fact that of his own inner life from which there can be no escape. In Lytton’s novel, Zanoni, you will notice the grave Master, Mejnour, trying to aid Zanoni, even at the time when the latter was falling slowly but surely into the meshes twisted by himself that ended in his destruction. Mejnour knew the law and so did Zanoni. The latter was suffering from some former error which"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" C ONCOVERSATIONS O N O CCULTISM  400-O he had to work out the former, if himself too stern and unkind, would later on come to the appropriate grief for such a mistake. But meanwhile he was bound to help his friend, as are all those who really believe in brotherhood. Student .––What one of those rules in any way corresponds to “Thou shalt not steal”? Sage .–– That one which was long ago expressed by the ancient sage in the words, “Do not covet the wealth of any creature.” This is better than “Thou shalt not steal,” for you cannot steal unless you covet. If you steal for hunger you may be forgiven, but you conveted the food a purpose, just as another covets merely for the sake of possession. The wealth of others includes all their possessions, and does not mean mere money alone. Their ideas, their private thoughts, their mental forces, powers, and faculties, their psychic powers--all, indeed, on all planes that they own or have. While they in that realm are willing to give it all away, it must not be coveted by another. You have no right, therefore, to enter into the mind of another who has not given the permission and take from him what is not yours. You become a burglar on the mental and psychic plane when you break this rule. You are forbidden taking anything for personal gain, profit, advantage, or use But you may take what is for general food, if you are far enough advanced and good enough to be able to extricate the personal element from it. This rule would, you can see, cut off all those who are well known to every observer, who want psychic powers for themselves and their own uses If such persons had those powers of inner sight and hearing that they so much want, no power could prevent them from committing theft on the unseen planes wherever they met a nature that was not protected And as most of us are very far from perfect, so far, indeed, that we must work for many lives, yet the Masters of Wisdom do not aid our defective natures in the getting of weapons that would cut our own hands For the law acts implacably, and the breaches made would find their end and result in long after years The Black Lodge, however, is very willing to let any poor, 400-P  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS we ak, or sinful mortal get such power, because that would swell the number of victims they so much require. Student.— Is there any rule corresponding to “Thou shalt not bear false witness”? Sage .—Yes; the one which requires you never to inject into the brain of another a false or untrue thought. As we can project our thoughts to another’s mind, we must not throw untrue ones to another. It comes before him, and he, overcome by its strength perhaps, finds it echoing in him, and it is a false witness speaking falsely within, confusing and confounding the inner spectator who lives on thought. Student .—How can one prevent the natural action of the mind when pictures of the"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"private lives of others rise before one? Sage .—That is difficult for the run of men. Hence the mass have not the power in general; it is kept back as much as possible. But when the trained soul looks about in the realm of soul it is also able to direct its sight, and when it finds rising up a picture of what it should not voluntarily take, it turns its face away. A warning comes with all such pictures which must be obeyed. This is not a rare rule or piece of information, for there are many natural clairvoyants who know it very well, though many of them do not think that others have the same knowledge. Student .—What do you mean by a warning coming with the picture? Sage .—In this realm the slightest thought becomes a voice or a picture. All thoughts make pictures. Every person has his private thoughts and desires. Around these he makes also a picture of his wish for privacy, and that to the clairvoyant becomes a voice or picture of warning which seems to say it must be let alone. With some it may assume the form of a person who says not to approach, with others it will be a voice, with still others a simple but certain knowledge that the matter is sacred. All these varieties depend on the psychological idiosyncrasies of the seer. Student .—What kind of thought or knowledge is excepted from these rules? Sage .—General, and philosophical, religious, and moral. C ONVERSATIONS O N O CCULTISM  400-Q Th a t is to say, there is no law of copyright or patent which is purely human in invention and belongs to the competitive system. When a man thinks out truly a philosophical problem it is not his under the laws of nature; it belongs to all; he is not in this realm entitled to any glory, to any profit, to any private use in it. Hence the seer may take as much of it as he pleases, but must on his part not claim it or use it for himself. Similarly with other generally beneficial matters. They are for all. If a Spencer thinks out a long series of wise things good for all men, the seer can take them all. Indeed, but few thinkers do any original thinking. They pride themselves on doing so, but in fact their seeking minds go out all over the world of mind and take from those of slower movement what is good and true, and then make them their own, sometimes gaining glory, sometimes money, and in this age claiming all as theirs and profiting by it. –––––––––– Student.— At a former time you spoke of entities that crowd the spaces about us. Are these all unconscious or otherwise? Sage .—They are not all unconscious. First, there are the humdrum masses of elementals that move like nerve-currents with every motion of man, beast, or natural elements. Next are classes of those which have a peculiar power and consciousness of their own and not easily reached by any man.

These Black entities are the Dugpas, the Black Magicians. Student .—Have they anything to do with the shocks, 400-R  B LAVATSKY : C OLLECTED W RITINGS kn ocks, bad influences, disintegration of soft material accompanied by noises more or less distinct? Sage.— Yes, they have. Not always, of course. But where they are actually seen at the time preceding such occurrence, they are the agents. Student .—Then I am to suppose that if such takes place with me I am the attracting person, the unfortunate channel through which they have come? Sage .—No, you are thoroughly in error there. You are not such channel in that case. You are in fact the opposite, and the very cause for the temporary defeat of that dark entity. You have mistaken the appearance, the outer manipulation of forces, for the thing itself. If you were their channel, their agent, the cause for their coming and thus making their presence possible, there would be no noise and no explosion. They would then act in and through you for the hurt of others, silently and insidiously. They approach your sphere and attempt to make entry. The strength of your character, of your aspiration, of your life, throws them off, and they are obliged, like rain-clouds, to discharge themselves. The more strong they are, the louder will be their retreating manifestation. For the time they are temporarily destroyed or, rather, put outside the combat, and, like a war vessel, have to retire for repairs. In their case this consists in accumulating force for a new attack, there or elsewhere. Student .—If, then, such loud explosions, with pulverization of wall-plaster and the like, take place, and such an evil entity is seen astrally, it follows that the person near whom it all occurred—if identification due to solitude is possible—was in fact the person who, by reason of inner power and opposition to the evil entity, became the cause for its bursting or temporary defeat? Sage .—Yes, that is correct. The person is not the cause for the entity’s approach, nor its friend, but is the safeguard in fact for those who otherwise would be insidiously affected. Uninformed students are likely to argue the other way, but that will be due to want of correct knowledge. I will describe to you condensedly an actual case. Sitting at C ONVERSATIONS O N O CCULTISM  400-S "},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"rest on a seat, eyes closed, I saw approach one of those evil entities along the astral currents, and looking as a man.

But as I looked at him the confidence I felt and the protection about me acted as an intense shock to him, and he appeared to burst from within, to stagger, fall to pieces, and then disappeared. Just as the disintegration began, a loud noise was caused by the sudden discharge of astral electricity, causing reactions that immediately transmitted themselves into the objects in the room, until, reaching the limit of tension, they created a noise. This is just the phenomenon of thunder, which accompanies discharges in the clouds and is followed by equilibrium. Student.— Can I carry this explanation into every objective phenomenon, say, then, of spiritualistic rappings? Sage .—No, not to every case. It holds with many, but specially relates to the conscious entities I was speaking of. Very often the small taps and raps one hears are produced under the law referred to, but without the presence of such an entity. These are the final dissipations of collected energy. That does not always argue a present extraneous and conscious entity. But in so far as these taps are the conclusion of an operation, that is, the thunder from one astral cloud to another, they are dissipations of accumulated force. With this distinction in mind you should not be confused. Student .—Have not colors a good deal to do with this matter? Sage .—Yes; but just now we will not go into the question of color except to say that the evil entities referred to often assume a garb of good color, but are not able to hide the darkness that belongs to their nature.
