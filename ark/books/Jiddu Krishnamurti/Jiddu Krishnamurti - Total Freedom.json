Their truths were unfolded in profound discourses andsagacious dialogues—oral expositions transmitted to us in incomplete renderings.Thus, only some of the verities are known; many have been lost. Those who seekthe complete scheme, as originally presented, have to depend on unreliableintermediaries such as faith, interpretation, interpolation, and reconstruction.As we move closer to our time, this problem is inverted. Knowledge overtakeswisdom and culture surrenders to technology. Recordings are comprehensive, butwhat is recorded is often of lesser value. There is, it seems, a shortage ofauthentic sages. By the numbers there are plenty who purvey wisdom andpseudo-wisdom, teachers claiming to possess and provide transcendent insights.However, very few of them survive the tests that surely define a real spiritualpathfinder—the ability to convey a message that is universal and liberating,nondiscriminating and free of hatred; a message that is capable of disinterestedenrichment of minds and lives, and is also within the understanding of everyone.By any or all of these yardsticks, J. Krishnamurti was truly a modern master.Krishnamurti’s entire life was focused on realizing and explaining the humanquest. For six decades, until his death in 1986 at the age of ninety, hetraveled the world bringing his thoughts to those who would listen. Millionsdid. His popularity sometimes fluctuated, but Krishnamurti persisted in hisefforts to “set man absolutely, unconditionally free.” Toward the end of hislife, new generations—children of our technetronic age—rediscoveredKrishnamurti. In an era of hot shots and holy rollers, razzle-dazzle religionand pulpit rap, he retained the aura of an old-fashioned prophet. Philosophicfads came and went; Krishnamurti endured.There are two reasons for this apparent timelessness. The most obvious is, ofcourse, the personality of Krishnamurti. His public persona radiated a kind ofundemonstrative charisma, the attraction of luminous restraint. Add to this aspeaking manner and tone that could evoke a personal intimacy in the midst ofeven the largest audiences. It is not surprising that the writer Aldous Huxley,no slouch when it came to critical observation, declaimed: “It was likelistening to a discourse of the Buddha—such power, such intrinsic authority.”Yet, in the end, personality alone is an unsatisfactory explanation. Many whodid not see or hear Krishnamurti were and still are drawn to his thoughts. So,to appreciate the appeal we must go to the philosophic source—the ideas hearticulated and their main themes. A careful examination of this body of workwill reveal both consistency and changes. While certain central concepts remainfundamental, Krishnamurti did not hesitate to adapt and evolve to new historicalcircumstances and spiritual quests.Again and again, Krishnamurti declared that people do not need guidance, theyneed awakening. This high confidence in human potential was rooted in the beliefthat each individual has no limit on development, if he can eschew the culturalbarnacles that load his being: “A theory based on another man’s experience inmatters of the psyche or of an inward life has no meaning at all…. We have tolet it go completely because we have to stand alone.” With this denial of thetransferability of experience and the rejection of all spiritual guidance,including his own, Krishnamurti breaks with most world religions—all of whichhave spiritual paradigms and instructors whose examples we can emulate. It wasnot his purpose to attack other faiths, but he frequently warns against themisleading power of religions, institutions, and rituals—and above all, thedivisiveness of sectarianism.As the years passed, Krishnamurti’s philosophic and intellectual membranesexpanded beyond his core themes. Increasingly, we see him addressing the evilsof civil and religious power, the futility of existing social structures, theinertia of conformity, and the failure of temporizing reform. By the mid-1950s,Krishnamurti had developed notions about education, human relations, andcommunications that are not found in his earlier discourses. The teacher wasalso learning—not only answering the questions of others but also extending hisown questions. Yet, the range of his expositions grows to embrace a number ofnew concerns—nationalism, war, ecological despoliation, unemployment, andhunger. With an almost contemporary sensitivity, social issues that were once onthe periphery of his perceptions come closer to center stage. References to thesignificance of meditation become more frequent. A note of impatience, anurgency, begins to surface. Krishnamurti senses the peril of the times and thecompelling demand for action. As if to respond in style as well as substance,his talks become more focused and his dialogues less elliptical. And yet, theessential message is unchanged: “When one sees life as it is, when one seesoneself as one is, [only] from there can one move [ahead].”Of all the sages and significant spiritual figures of modern times, Krishnamurtihas had the longest exposure—about sixty-five years on the stage of eminence.Yet, it is difficult to assess his historical stature. He is too close to us andit is too early to know the full effect of his teachings. After all, for severaldecades subsequent to his crucifixion, there was little sign that Jesus Christwould make a major mark on history. At the moment of their death and for quitesome time after, who could have predicted the long-term influence of the Buddha,Confucius, or even Karl Marx? If Krishnamurti’s ideas become more widelyaccepted in the future, it will be because they resonate with the yearnings ofpeople—because they speak intently to individuals disillusioned with all-knowingand socially transforming macroideologies. Should this outcome take place, itwill be because Krishnamurti’s discourses resonate across boundaries of time andplace. His voice is silent but its message never ceases to speak.Ralph Buultjens, Ph.D.Professor of Social Sciences, New York University,former Nehru Professor at Cambridge university, U.K."},{"pageContent":"PREFACE [index_split_001.html#filepos1081] From obscure beginnings in a small town in India, Krishnamurti emerged as anuncompromising and unclassifiable teacher, whose talks and writings were notlinked to any specific religion and were neither of the East nor the West butfor the whole world.For some sixty years he spoke to vast audiences in words that were of vital,catalytic relevance to every individual and every society. He had frequentdiscussions with distinguished writers, philosophers, scientists, educators, andnational leaders. With extraordinary immediacy and directness, and without anyframeworks or dependencies, he was able to reach the core of problems with whichhumanity has grappled for centuries.Krishnamurti’s books have been published all over the world and translated intomore than twenty languages. His works are also available on audio and videorecordings and electronic disks. Much of this material is now used in over 150colleges and universities.Faced with this volume of material, we have chosen a broad range of previouslypublished works as well as unpublished ones to give a sense of the depth andbreadth of Krishnamurti’s teaching. Readers are, of course, encouraged to lookbeyond this selection to the whole body of his talks and writings.The full text of “Truth Is a Pathless Land,” the talk which set in motion hisbreak with Theosophy, is included as it embodies the theme that informed hislife’s work. The rest of the book has four, more or less chronologicallyarranged, parts.Part 1 [index_split_006.html#filepos47481] contains material from talks given inthe years following his dissociation from Theosophy. Part 2[index_split_014.html#filepos179980] is drawn from accounts of his conversationswith various individuals, an early work on education, and the more privateJournal and Krishnamurti to Himself.Part 3 [index_split_046.html#filepos468751] presents, from records of publicmeetings, discussions with students and talks with Foundation Trustees, anindication of the great variety of questions that Krishnamurti dealt with duringhis years of traveling and meeting people.The final part opens with Krishnamurti’s own statement of The Core of histeaching, followed by talks from the later years, which explore the themes ofThe Core and recall his earlier declaration of truth as a pathless land that istotal freedom, love, and intelligence.Mary Cadogan, Alan Kishbaugh, Mark Lee, Ray McCoy"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [index_split_001.html#filepos1218] When first privileged to meet Krishnamurti, I was deeply struck by the intensityof his quietude. The intensity bespoke great energy and his quietude expressed asettled tranquility. Such a combination is rare; indeed, so rare that onencountering it nothing can be taken for granted.Our meeting was, as we say loosely, accidental. It was in a sound studio. I hadneither met him before nor read any of his books. Yet, amazingly, he invited meon the spot to undertake a videotaped dialogue with him. He seemed not in theleast concerned that, in the ordinary sense, he did not know me from Adam. Iinferred that he was either a great gambler or so attuned to the present instantthat his action was exact, a paragon of timeliness. There was somethingprofoundly impersonal in that invitation without his being aloof or indifferent.The next shock came with his asking me, “What would you like to talk about?” Ireplied, “How about hearing and seeing?” He accepted the topic joyously. And soimmediately began, impromptu, a conversation on inward hearing and inwardseeing. Two years later, again utterly unexpectedly, he invited me to undertakea series of dialogues that would encompass the kernel of his teaching. Thoughyears before I had been in radio broadcasting—announcing and newscasting—and sohad some professional acquaintance with studio programming, none of thatexperience was decisive for the movement of the dialogues. They developedwithout any rehearsal, prearrangement, contrivance, or hands-on fashioning. Bothhis ease and intensity of focus were amazing.Krishnamurti was an exact embodiment of his doctrine of “choiceless awareness.”Here, the word choiceless might suggest only a mode of subjectivity. On thecontrary, choiceless awareness, while reflected in the persona, is in no wayreducible to it and so eludes a psychological reduction. Choicelessness is themind’s equivalent of the silence out of which intelligible utterance arises, of“that emptiness in which the things of the mind can exist but the things are notthe mind … that emptiness has no center and so is capable of infinite movement.Creation is born out of this emptiness but it is not the creation of man puttingthings together. That creation of emptiness is love and death.” This lastsentence points directly and immediately to the character of the instant forboth self-awakening and self-misunderstanding. Unless there is a psychologicaldeath to our self-identification with memory and upon the same instant a totalunderstanding of need, we remain collapsed into the content of thought and atimely response to the instant eludes us:> “When there is a total understanding of need, the outward and the inner, then> desire is not a torture. Then it has a quite different meaning, a significance> far beyond the content of thought and it goes beyond feeling, with its> emotions, myths and illusions. With the total understanding of need, not the> mere quantity or the quality of it, desire then is a flame and not a torture.> Without this flame life itself is lost. It is this flame that burns away the> pettiness of its object, the frontiers, the fences that have been imposed upon> it. Then call it by whatever name you will, love, death, beauty. Then it is> there without an end.” Some might think it untoward to begin a short introduction to sagely works witha personal anecdote. One thinks of Krishnamurti’s repeated caution to hisaudiences: “The speaker is unimportant.” Then there is Chuang Tzu’s: “ThePerfect man has no self; the Holy man has no merit; the Sage has no fame.” (Allthree being the same.) True enough and almost never pondered, let aloneembodied. Yet to find in such words an invitation to ignore the personalpresence of a great teacher (whether in the flesh or remembered) betrays ashallow readiness to try to go beyond where one has not begun. Krishnamurtiadmonishes us that “Meditation is not something different from daily life … itis the seeing of what is and going beyond it.” If one has not seen what is, howcan one go beyond it?Unfortunately, academic practice shows little or no understanding of “seeingwhat is” in the context of genuine self-inquiry. Rather, academic life is ajourney through the forest of abstractions. Experimental science has theadvantage of requiring laboratory demonstration of its theoretical conclusions.Even so, this procedure is pursued within the dual structure of perceiver andperceived. Perception without the perceiver, as in meditation, is unheard of:> “This perception is entirely different from seeing an object without an> observer, because in the perception of meditation there is no object and> therefore no experience. What meaning has such meditation? There is no> meaning; there is no utility. But in that meditation there is a movement of> great ecstasy. It is the ecstasy which gives to the eye, to the brain, and to> the heart the quality of innocency. Without seeing life as something totally> new, it is a routine, a boredom, a meaningless affair. So meditation is of the> greatest importance. It opens the door to the incalculable, to the> measureless.” This ecstatic pointer of Krishnamurti’s so escapes our contemporary mind-set asto be practically unintelligible. Yet it is supremely intelligent. How so?Because it implies a radical distinction between consciousness and awareness. Inour time, philosophy and depth psychology have virtually absolutizedconsciousness. They fail to discern that consciousness is not self-correcting.How can it be so since consciousness is ever tied to change? It is only asawareness has an object that consciousness comes into play. In itself awarenessis both independent of objects and changeless. On that account it is the door tothe incalculable and measureless.Krishnamurti invites us to begin the most radical self-inquiry since it opensout upon the infinite space of awareness. Self-inquiry begins by asking not whatam I but what am I not? Such a no-nonsense question has no need of theoreticalstructures, the conceptual paraphernalia of our depth psychologies,philosophies, and theologies and belief systems. The question is astonishinglyyet frighteningly simple; frightening because it entails the deepest sense ofaloneness, since none but oneself can ask the question nor answer it. Yet, withthe patience, courage, and radical trust to hang in there without bolting fromit one discovers the unlonely aloneness of that “meditation which is absolutelyno effort, no achievement, no thinking, the brain is quiet, not made quiet bywill, by intention, by conclusion and all that nonsense; it is quiet. And, beingquiet, it has infinite space.”In this short introduction, I have deliberately avoided taking an academicapproach to Krishnamurti’s teaching. To have done so would have falsified hisspirit and quite missed the mark of his message. He was not concerned with thecareer of ideas and the ongoing palaver that is believed to express the finestexamples of the life of the mind. In his last talk (January 1986) he put thematter cogently and succinctly:> “It would be useless for you and the speaker to listen to a lot of words, but> if we could together take a very long journey, not in terms of time, not in> terms of belief or conclusions or theories, but in examining very carefully> the way of our lives, fear, uncertainty, insecurity and all the inventions> that man has made, including the extraordinary computers. If we take a long> journey into this, where are we at the end of two million years? Where are we> going, not as some theory, not what some wretched book says, however holy it> is, but where are we all going? And where have we begun? They’re both related> to each other: where we are going, where we begin. The beginning may be the> ending. Don’t agree. Find out.” Right away, one hears the cry: “How? How find out?!” The very word, how, betraysa belief in the power of process and procedure to produce an effect; and indeed,they do in the material order. But here, the directive to find out addresses adifferent sphere, the sphere of one’s misrelation to oneself. The attempt toimpose upon this disorder any discipline according to a pattern only hardens themisrelation, binding it further to time, belief, conclusions, and theories.There is no how to making a pure act of attention to what is at hand. There isnothing mysterious about this. In fact, in the normal course of daily living wemake, perhaps, a few such acts but quickly fall out of them. Why? The answer tothat question comes only through self-examination—not through theories of theunconscious or from learned disquisitions on the nature of man. The pure act ofattention is spontaneous and free; the hearer and the heard, the perceiver andperceived drop away leaving only listening and seeing. “Only when the mind isblissful, quiet, without any movement of its own, without projection of thought,conscious or unconscious—only then does the eternal come into being.”During this century we have taken in with our mother’s milk the enervating dogmathat the hallmarks of human nature are anxiety (angst) and estrangement, asecularized version of the dogma of original sin. But through meditation, asKrishnamurti revealed it, and self-inquiry, one discovers one’s original nature,original innocence and the natural state. Is this, then, the heart of thematter? Yes, since the heart of the matter is a matter of the heart.Allan W. AndersonProfessor Emeritus of Religious StudiesSan Diego University"},{"pageContent":"TRUTH IS A PATHLESS LAND [index_split_001.html#filepos1385] The Dissolution of the Order of the StarThe Order of the Star in the East was founded in 1911 to proclaim the coming ofthe World Teacher. Krishnamurti was made Head of the Order. On August 2, 1929,the opening day of the annual Star Camp at Ommen, Holland, Krishnamurtidissolved the Order before three thousand members. This is the full text of thetalk he gave on that occasion. We are going to discuss this morning the dissolution of the Order of the Star.Many people will be delighted, and others will be rather sad. It is a questionneither for rejoicing nor for sadness, because it is inevitable, as I am goingto explain.You may remember the story of how the devil and a friend of his were walkingdown the street when they saw ahead of them a man stoop down and pick upsomething from the ground, look at it, and put it away in his pocket. The friendsaid to the devil, “What did that man pick up?” “He picked up a piece of Truth,”said the devil. “That is a very bad business for you, then,” said his friend.“Oh, not at all,” the devil replied, “I am going to let him organize it.”I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any pathwhatsoever, by any religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhereto that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth, being limitless, unconditioned,unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should anyorganization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path. Ifyou first understand that, then you will see how impossible it is to organize abelief. A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot and must notorganize it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystalized; it becomes a creed, asect, a religion, to be imposed on others. This is what everyone throughout theworld is attempting to do. Truth is narrowed down and made a plaything for thosewho are weak, for those who are only momentarily discontented. Truth cannot bebrought down; rather, the individual must make the effort to ascend to it. Youcannot bring the mountaintop to the valley. If you would attain to themountaintop you must pass through the valley, climb the steeps, unafraid of thedangerous precipices. You must climb toward the Truth, it cannot be “steppeddown” or organized for you. Interest in ideas is mainly sustained byorganizations, but organizations only awaken interest from without. Interest,which is not born out of love of Truth for its own sake, but aroused by anorganization, is of no value. The organization becomes a framework into whichits members can conveniently fit. They no longer strive after Truth or themountaintop, but rather carve for themselves a convenient niche in which theyput themselves, or let the organization place them, and consider that theorganization will thereby lead them to Truth.So that is the first reason, from my point of view, why the Order of the Starshould be dissolved. In spite of this, you will probably form other Orders, youwill continue to belong to other organizations searching for Truth. I do notwant to belong to any organization of a spiritual kind, please understand this.I would make use of an organization which would take me to London, for example;this is quite a different kind of organization, merely mechanical, like the postor the telegraph. I would use a motorcar or a steamship to travel; these areonly physical mechanisms which have nothing whatever to do with spirituality.Again, I maintain that no organization can lead man to spirituality.If an organization be created for this purpose, it becomes a crutch, a weakness,a bondage, and must cripple the individual, and prevent him from growing, fromestablishing his uniqueness, which lies in the discovery for himself of thatabsolute, unconditioned Truth. So that is another reason why I have decided, asI happen to be the Head of the Order, to dissolve it. No one has persuaded me tothis decision.This is no magnificent deed, because I do not want followers, and I mean this.The moment you follow someone you cease to follow Truth. I am not concernedwhether you pay attention to what I say or not. I want to do a certain thing inthe world and I am going to do it with unwavering concentration. I am concerningmyself with only one essential thing: to set man free. I desire to free him fromall cages, from all fears, and not to found religions, new sects, nor toestablish new theories and new philosophies. Then you will naturally ask me whyI go the world over, continually speaking. I will tell you for what reason I dothis: not because I desire a following, not because I desire a special group ofspecial disciples. (How men love to be different from their fellowmen, howeverridiculous, absurd, and trivial their distinctions may be! I do not want toencourage that absurdity.) I have no disciples, no apostles, either on earth orin the realm of spirituality.Nor is it the lure of money, nor the desire to live a comfortable life, whichattracts me. If I wanted to lead a comfortable life I would not come to a campor live in a damp country! I am speaking frankly because I want this settledonce and for all. I do not want these childish discussions year after year.One newspaper reporter, who interviewed me, considered it a magnificent act todissolve an organization in which there were thousands and thousands of members.To him it was a great act because, he said: “What will you do afterwards, howwill you live? You will have no following, people will no longer listen to you.”If there are only five people who will listen, who will live, who have theirfaces turned toward eternity, it will be sufficient. Of what use is it to havethousands who do not understand, who are fully embalmed in prejudice, who do notwant the new, but would rather translate the new to suit their own sterile,stagnant selves? If I speak strongly, please do not misunderstand me; it is notthrough lack of compassion. If you go to a surgeon for an operation, is it notkindness on his part to operate even if he causes you pain? So, in like manner,if I speak straightly, it is not through lack of real affection, on thecontrary.As I have said, I have only one purpose: to make man free, to urge him towardfreedom, to help him to break away from all limitations, for that alone willgive him eternal happiness, will give him the unconditioned realization of theself.Because I am free, unconditioned, whole—not the part, not the relative, but thewhole Truth that is eternal—I desire those, who seek to understand me, to befree; not to follow me, not to make out of me a cage which will become areligion, a sect. Rather should they be free from all fears—from the fear ofreligion, from the fear of salvation, from the fear of spirituality, from thefear of love, from the fear of death, from the fear of life itself. As an artistpaints a picture because he takes delight in that painting, because it is hisself-expression, his glory, his well-being, so I do this and not because I wantanything from anyone.You are accustomed to authority, or to the atmosphere of authority, which youthink will lead you to spirituality. You think and hope that another can, by hisextraordinary powers—a miracle—transport you to this realm of eternal freedom,which is Happiness. Your whole outlook on life is based on that authority.You have listened to me for three years now, without any change taking placeexcept in the few. Now analyze what I am saying, be critical, so that you mayunderstand thoroughly, fundamentally. When you look for an authority to lead youto spirituality, you are bound automatically to build an organization aroundthat authority. By the very creation of that organization, which, you think,will help this authority to lead you to spirituality, you are held in a cage.If I talk frankly, please remember that I do so, not out of harshness, not outof cruelty, not out of the enthusiasm of my purpose, but because I want you tounderstand what I am saying. That is the reason why you are here, and it wouldbe a waste of time if I did not explain clearly, decisively, my point of view.For eighteen years you have been preparing for this event, for the Coming of theWorld Teacher. For eighteen years you have organized, you have looked forsomeone who would give a new delight to your hearts and minds, who wouldtransform your whole life, who would give you a new understanding; for someonewho would raise you to a new plane of life, who would give you a newencouragement, who would set you free—and now look what is happening! Consider,reason with yourselves, and discover in what way that belief has made youdifferent—not with the superficial difference of the wearing of a badge, whichis trivial, absurd. In what manner has such a belief swept away all theunessential things of life? That is the only way to judge: In what way are youfreer, greater, more dangerous to every Society which is based on the false andthe unessential? In what way have the members of this organization of the Starbecome different?As I said, you have been preparing for eighteen years for me. I do not care ifyou believe that I am the World Teacher or not. That is of very littleimportance. Since you belong to the organization of the Order of the Star, youhave given your sympathy, your energy, acknowledging that Krishnamurti is theWorld Teacher partially or wholly: wholly for those who are really seeking, onlypartially for those who are satisfied with their own half-truths.You have been preparing for eighteen years, and look how many difficulties thereare in the way of your understanding, how many complications, how many trivialthings. Your prejudices, your fears, your authorities, your churches new andold—all these, I maintain, are a barrier to understanding. I cannot make myselfclearer than this. I do not want you to agree with me. I do not want you tofollow me. I want you to understand what I am saying.This understanding is necessary because your belief has not transformed you butonly complicated you, and because you are not willing to face things as theyare. You want to have your own gods—new gods instead of the old, new religionsinstead of the old, new forms instead of the old—all equally valueless, allbarriers, all limitations, all crutches. Instead of old spiritual distinctionsyou have new spiritual distinctions, instead of old worships you have newworships. You are all depending for your spirituality on someone else, for yourhappiness on someone else, for your enlightenment on someone else; and althoughyou have been preparing for me for eighteen years, when I say all these thingsare unnecessary, when I say that you must put them all away and look withinyourselves for the enlightenment, for the glory, for the purification, and forthe incorruptibility of the self, not one of you is willing to do it. There maybe a few, but very, very few.So why have an organization?Why have false, hypocritical people following me, the embodiment of Truth?Please remember that I am not saying something harsh or unkind, but we havereached a situation when you must face things as they are. I said last year thatI would not compromise. Very few listened to me then. This year I have made itabsolutely clear. I do not know how many thousands throughout the world—membersof the Order—have been preparing for me for eighteen years, and yet now they arenot willing to listen unconditionally, wholly, to what I say.So why have an organization?As I said before, my purpose is to make men unconditionally free, for I maintainthat the only spirituality is the incorruptibility of the self, which iseternal, is the harmony between reason and love. This is the absolute,unconditioned Truth, which is Life itself. I want, therefore, to set man free,rejoicing as the bird in the clear sky, unburdened, independent, ecstatic inthat freedom. And I, for whom you have been preparing for eighteen years, nowsay that you must be free of all these things, free from your complications,your entanglements. For this you need not have an organization based onspiritual belief. Why have an organization for five or ten people in the worldwho understand, who are struggling, who have put aside all trivial things? Andfor the weak people, there can be no organization to help them to find theTruth, because Truth is in everyone; it is not far, it is not near; it iseternally there.Organizations cannot make you free. No man from outside can make you free; norcan organized worship, nor the immolation of yourselves for a cause, make youfree; nor can forming yourselves into an organization, nor throwing yourselvesinto works, make you free. You use a typewriter to write letters, but you do notput it on an altar and worship it. But that is what you are doing whenorganizations become your chief concern. “How many members are there in it?”That is the first question I am asked by all newspaper reporters. “How manyfollowers have you? By their number we shall judge whether what you say is trueor false.” I do not know how many there are. I am not concerned with that. As Isaid, if there were even one man who had been set free, that is enough.Again, you have the idea that only certain people hold the key to the Kingdom ofHappiness. No one holds it. No one has the authority to hold that key. That keyis your own self, and in the development and the purification and in theincorruptibility of that self alone is the Kingdom of Eternity.So you will see how absurd is the whole structure that you have built, lookingfor external help, depending on others for your comfort, for your happiness, foryour strength. These can only be found within yourselves.So why have an organization?You are accustomed to being told how far you have advanced, what is yourspiritual status. How childish! Who but yourself can tell you if you arebeautiful or ugly within? Who but yourself can tell you if you areincorruptible? You are not serious in these things.So why have an organization?But those who really desire to understand, who are looking to find that which iseternal, without beginning and without an end, will walk together with a greaterintensity, will be a danger to everything that is unessential, to unrealities,to shadows. And they will concentrate, they will become the flame, because theyunderstand. Such a body we must create, and that is my purpose. Because of thatreal understanding there will be true friendship. Because of that truefriendship—which you do not seem to know—there will be real cooperation on thepart of each one. And this not because of authority, not because of salvation,not because of immolation for a cause, but because you really understand, andhence are capable of living in the eternal. This is a greater thing than allpleasure, than all sacrifice.So these are some of the reasons why, after careful consideration for two years,I have made this decision. It is not from a momentary impulse. I have not beenpersuaded to it by anyone. I am not persuaded in such things. For two years Ihave been thinking about this, slowly, carefully, patiently, and I have nowdecided to disband the Order, as I happen to be its Head. You can form otherorganizations and expect someone else. With that I am not concerned, nor withcreating new cages, new decorations for those cages. My only concern is to setmen absolutely, unconditionally free."},{"pageContent":"PART 1EARLY WORKS [index_split_001.html#filepos1529] Jiddu Krishnamurti was born in 1895 into a modest Brahmin home in Madanapalle,India. His mother died when he was ten, and during his childhood he was delicateand frequently ill. When his father retired from government employment, hearranged with Annie Besant, the President of the International TheosophicalSociety, to work for this organization of which he had been a member for someyears. Krishnamurti, then in his fourteenth year, moved with three of hisbrothers and his father to the Theosophical headquarters in Madras.A deeply affectionate bond formed between Mrs. Besant and Krishnamurti, and shebecame his legal guardian. The theosophists had been awaiting the advent of a“World Teacher,” to prepare for whose coming they had formed a group known asthe Order of the Star in the East, with Krishnamurti at its Head. In 1912Krishnamurti was formally proclaimed the World Teacher, but in 1929 he disbandedthe Order with his spiritually radical speech “Truth Is a Pathless Land.” Bydoing so he rejected estates, money, power, and all claims to authority or gurustatus.For the rest of his life he traveled extensively, giving talks to all who caredto listen in Europe, India, the United States, South America, Australia, and NewZealand. Thousands from all walks of life came to hear him.This part comprises a selection from his talks given in the mid-1930s. Itincludes one given in Mexico City and a series given in 1934 in Ojai,California, where Krishnamurti later spent the years of World War II (1939 to1945)."},{"pageContent":"WHAT I WANT TO DO [index_split_001.html#filepos1687] You may ask, “What is it that you want to do? If you don’t want us to join anysociety or accept certain theories, what is it then that you want to do?”What I want to do is to help you, the individual, to cross the stream ofsuffering, confusion and conflict, through deep and complete fulfillment. Thisfulfillment does not come through egotistic self-expression, nor throughcompulsion and imitation. Not through some fantastic sentiment and conclusions,but through clear thinking, through intelligent action, we shall cross thisstream of pain and sorrow. There is a reality which can be understood onlythrough deep and true fulfillment.Before we can understand the richness and the beauty of fulfillment, mind mustfree itself from the background of tradition, habit, and prejudice. For example,if you belong to a particular political party, you naturally regard all yourpolitical considerations from the narrow, limited point of view of that party.If you have been brought up, nursed, conditioned in a certain religion, you lookat life through its veil of prejudice and darkness. That background of traditionprevents the complete understanding of life, and so causes confusion andsuffering.I would beg of you to listen to what I have to say, freeing yourself for thishour at least from the background in which you have been brought up, with itstraditions and prejudices, and think simply and directly about the many humanproblems.To be truly critical is not to be in opposition. Most of us have been trained tooppose and not to criticize. When a man merely opposes, it generally indicatesthat he has some vested interest which he desires to protect, and that is notdeep penetration through critical examination. True criticism lies in trying tounderstand the full significance of values without the hindrance of defensivereactions.We see throughout the world extremes of poverty and riches, abundance and at thesame time starvation; we have class distinction and racial hatred, the stupidityof nationalism and the appalling cruelty of war. There is exploitation of man byman; religions with their vested interests have become the means ofexploitation, also dividing man from man. There is anxiety, confusion,hopelessness, frustration.We see all this. It is part of our daily life. Caught up in the wheel ofsuffering, if you are at all thoughtful you must have asked yourself how thesehuman problems can be solved. Either you are conscious of the chaotic state ofthe world, or you are completely asleep, living in a fantastic world, in anillusion. If you are aware, you must be grappling with these problems. In tryingto solve them, some turn to experts for their solution, and follow their ideasand theories. Gradually they form themselves into an exclusive body, and thusthey come into conflict with other experts and their parties; and the individualmerely becomes a tool in the hands of the group or of the expert. Or you try tosolve these problems by following a particular system, which, if you carefullyexamine it, becomes merely another means of exploiting the individual. Or youthink that to change all this cruelty and horror there must be a mass movement,a collective action.Now the idea of a mass movement becomes merely a catchword if you, theindividual, who are part of the mass, do not understand your true function. Truecollective action can take place only when you, the individual, who are also themass, are awake and take the full responsibility for your action withoutcompulsion.Please bear in mind that I am not giving you a system of philosophy which youcan follow blindly, but I am trying to awaken the desire for true andintelligent fulfillment, which alone can bring about happy order and peace inthe world.There can be fundamental and lasting change in the world, there can be love andintelligent fulfillment, only when you wake up and begin to free yourself fromthe net of illusions, the many illusions which you have created about yourselfthrough fear. When the mind frees itself from these hindrances, when there isthat deep, inward, voluntary change, then only can there be true, lasting,collective action, in which there can be no compulsion.Please understand that I am talking to you as an individual, not to a collectivegroup or to a particular party. If you do not awaken to your fullresponsibility, to your fulfillment, then your function as a human being insociety must be frustrated, limited, and in that lies sorrow.So the question is: How can there be this profound individual revolution? Ifthere is this true, voluntary revolution on the part of the individual, then youwill create the right environment for all, without the distinction of class orrace. Then the world will be a single human unit.How are you going to awaken as individuals to this profound revolution? Now whatI am going to say is not complicated, it is simple; and because of its verysimplicity, I am afraid you will reject it as not being positive. What you callpositive is to be given a definite plan, to be told exactly what to do. But ifyou can understand for yourself what are the hindrances that are preventing yourdeep and true fulfillment, then you will not become a mere follower and beexploited. All following is detrimental to completeness.To have this profound revolution, you must become fully conscious of thestructure which you have created about yourself and in which you are now caught.That is, we have now certain values, ideals, beliefs, which act as a net to holdthe mind, and by questioning and understanding all their significance, we shallrealize how they have come into existence. Before you can act fully and truly,you must know the prison in which you are living, how it has been created; andin examining it without any self-defense you will find out for yourself its truesignificance, which no other can convey to you. Through your own awakening ofintelligence, through your own suffering you will discover the manner of truefulfillment.Each one of us is seeking security, certainty, through egotistic thought andaction, objectively and subjectively. If you are conscious of your own thought,you will see that you are pursuing your own egotistic certainty and security,both outwardly and inwardly. In reality, there is no such absolute division oflife as the objective and the subjective world. I make this division only forconvenience.Objectively, this search for egotistic security and certainty expresses itselfthrough family, which becomes a center of exploitation, based onacquisitiveness. If you examine it, you will see that what you call the love offamily is nothing but possessiveness.That search for security again expresses itself through class divisions, whichdevelop into the stupidity of nationalism and imperialism, breeding hatred,racial antagonism, and the ultimate cruelty of war. So through our own egotisticdesires we have created a world of nationalities and conflicting sovereigngovernments, whose function is to prepare for war and force man against man.Then there is the search for egotistic security, certainty, through what we callreligion. You like fondly to believe that divine beings have created theseorganized forms of belief which we call religions. You yourself have createdthem for your own convenience; through ages they have become sanctified, and youhave now become enslaved to them. There can never be ideal religions, so let usnot waste our time discussing them. They can exist only in theory, not inreality. Let us examine how we have created religions and in what manner we areenslaved to them. If you deeply examine them as they are, you will see that theyare nothing but the vested interest of organized belief—holding, separating, andexploiting man. As you are objectively seeking security, so also you are seekingsubjectively a different kind of security, certainty, which you callimmortality. You crave egotistic continuance in the hereafter, calling itimmortality. Later in my talks I will explain what to me is true immortality.In your search for that security, fear is born, and so you submit yourself toanother who promises you that immortality. Through fear you create a spiritualauthority, and to administer that authority there are priests who exploit youthrough belief, dogma, and creed, through show, pomp, and pageantry, whichthroughout the world is called religion. It is essentially based on fear, thoughyou may call it the love of God or truth; it is, if you examine itintelligently, nothing but the result of fear and, therefore, it must become oneof the means of exploiting man. Through your own desire for immortality, forselfish continuance, you have built this illusion which you call religion, andyou are unconsciously or consciously caught in it. Or you may not belong to anyparticular religion, but you may belong to some sect which subtly promises areward, a subtle inflation of the ego in the hereafter. Or you may not belong toany society or sect, but there may be an inward desire, hidden and concealed, toseek your own immortality. So long as there is a desire for self-continuance inany form, there must be fear, which creates authority, and from this there comethe subtle cruelty and stupidity of submitting oneself to exploitation. Thisexploitation is so subtle, so refined, that one becomes enamored of it, callingit spiritual progress and advancement toward perfection.Now you, the individual, must become conscious of all this intricate structure,conscious of the source of fear, and be willing to eradicate it, whatever be theconsequence. This means coming into conflict individually with the existingideals and values; and when the mind frees itself from the false, there can bethe creation of right environment for the whole.Your first concern is to become conscious of the prison; then you will see thatyour own thought is continually trying to avoid coming into conflict with thevalues of the prison. This escape creates ideals which, however beautiful, arebut illusions. It is one of the tricks of the mind to escape into an ideal,because if it does not escape, it must come directly into conflict with theprison, with the environment. That is, the mind wants to escape into an illusionrather than face the suffering which will inevitably arise when it begins toquestion the values, the morality, the religion of the prison.So what matters is to come into conflict with the traditions and values of thesociety and religion in which you are caught, and not intellectually escapethrough an ideal. When you begin to question these values, you begin to awakenthat true intelligence which alone can solve the many human problems.As long as the mind is caught up in false values, there cannot be fulfillment.Completeness alone will reveal truth, the movement of eternal life.Mexico City, October 20, 1935"},{"pageContent":"WHAT ARE YOU SEEKING? [index_split_001.html#filepos1834] It is my purpose during these talks not so much to give a system of thought asto awaken thought, and to do that I am going to make certain statements,naturally not dogmatic, which I hope you will consider. As you consider them,there will arise many questions; if you will kindly put these to me, I will tryto answer them, and thus we can discuss further what I have to say.I wonder why most of you come here? Presumably you are seeking something. Andwhat are you seeking? You cannot answer that question, naturally, because yoursearch varies, the object of your search varies; the object of your search isconstantly changing, so you do not definitely know what you seek, what you want.But you have established, unfortunately, a habit of going from one supposedspiritual teacher to another supposed spiritual teacher, of joining variousorganizations, societies, and of following systems; in other words, trying tofind out what gives you greater and greater satisfaction, excitement.This process of going from one school of thought to another, from one system ofthought to another, from one teacher to another, you call the search for truth.In other words, you are going from one idea to another idea, from one system ofthought to another, accumulating, hoping to understand life, trying to fathomits significance, its struggles, each time declaring that you have foundsomething.Now, I hope you won’t say at the end of my talks that you have found something,because the moment you have found something you are already lost; it is ananchor to which mind clings and, therefore, that eternal movement, this truesearch of which I am going to speak, ceases. And most minds are looking for adefinite aim, with this definite desire to find, and when once there isestablished this desire, you will find something. But it won’t be somethingliving; it will be a dead thing that you will find and, therefore, you will putthat away to turn to another; and this process of continually choosing,continually discarding, you call acquiring wisdom, experience, or truth.Probably most of you have come here with this attitude, consciously orunconsciously, so your thought is expended merely on the search for schemes andconfirmations, on the desire to join a movement or form groups, without theclarity of the fundamental or trying to understand what these fundamental thingsof life mean. So as I said, I am not putting forward an ideal to be imitated, agoal to be found; but my purpose is, rather, to awaken that thought by which themind can liberate itself from these things which we have established, which wehave taken for granted as being true.Now, each one tries to immortalize the product of environment; that thing whichis the result of the environment we try to make eternal. That is, the variousfears, hopes, longings, prejudices, likes, and personal views which we glorifyas our temperament are, after all, the result, the product, of environment; andthis bundle of memories, which is the result of environment, the product of thereactions to environment, becomes that consciousness which we call the “I.” Isthat not so? The whole struggle is between the result of environment, with whichmind identifies itself and becomes the “I,” between that and environment. Afterall, the “I,” the consciousness with which the mind identifies itself, is theresult of environment. The struggle takes place between that “I” and theconstantly changing environment.You are continually seeking immortality for this “I.” In other words, falsehoodtries to become the real, the eternal. When you understand the significance ofthe environment, there is no reaction and, therefore, no conflict between thereaction, that is, between what we call the “I” and the creator of the reaction,which is the environment. So this seeking for immortality, this craving to becertain, to be lasting, is called the process of evolution, the process ofacquiring truth or God or the understanding of life. And anyone who helps youtoward this, who helps you to immortalize reaction, which we call the “I,” youmake of him your redeemer, your savior, your master, your teacher, and youfollow his system. You follow him with thought, or without thought; with thoughtwhen you think that you are following him with intelligence because he is goingto lead you to immortality, to the realization of that ecstasy. That is, youwant another to immortalize for you that reaction which is the outcome ofenvironment, which is in itself inherently false. Out of the desire toimmortalize that which is false you create religions, sociological systems anddivisions, political methods, economic panaceas, and moral standards. Sogradually in this process of developing systems to make the individual immortal,lasting, secure, the individual is completely lost, and he comes into conflictwith the creations of his own search, with the creations which are born out ofhis longing to be secure and which he calls immortality.After all, why should religions exist? Religions as divisions of thought havegrown, have been glorified and nourished by sets of beliefs because there isthis desire that you shall realize, that you shall attain, that there shall beimmortality.And again, moral standards are merely the creations of society, so that theindividual may be held within its bondage. To me, morality cannot bestandardized. There cannot be at the same time morality and standards. There canonly be intelligence, which is not, which cannot be, standardized. But we shallgo into that in my later talks.So this continual search in which each one of us is caught up, the search forhappiness, for truth, for reality, for health—this continual desire iscultivated by each one of us in order that we may be secure, permanent. And outof that search for permanency, there must be conflict, conflict between theresult of environment, that is, the “I,” and the environment itself.Now if you come to think of it, what is the “I”? When you talk about “I,”“mine,” my house, my enjoyment, my wife, my child, my love, my temperament, whatis that? It is nothing but the result of environment, and there is a conflictbetween that result, the “I,” and the environment itself. Conflict can only, andmust inevitably, exist between the false and the false, not between truth andthe false. Isn’t that so? There cannot be conflict between what is true and whatis false. But there can be conflict and there must be conflict between two falsethings, between the degrees of falseness, between the opposites.So do not think this struggle between the self and the environment, which youcall the true struggle, is true. Isn’t there a struggle taking place in each oneof you between yourself and your environment, your surroundings, your husband,your wife, your child, your neighbor, your society, your politicalorganizations? Is there not a constant battle going on? You consider that battlenecessary in order to help you to realize happiness, truth, immortality, orecstasy. To put it differently: What you consider to be the truth is butself-consciousness, the “I,” which is all the time trying to become immortal,and the environment, which I say is the continual movement of the false. Thismovement of the false becomes your ever-changing environment, which is calledprogress, evolution. So to me, happiness, or truth, or God, cannot be found asthe outcome of the result of environment, the “I,” the continually changingconditions.I will try to put it again, differently. There is conflict, of which each one ofyou is conscious, between yourself and the environment, the conditions. Now, yousay to yourself, “If I can conquer environment, overcome it, dominate it, Ishall find out, I shall understand” so there is this continual battle going onbetween yourself and environment.Now, what is the “yourself’? It is but the result, the product, of environment.So what are you doing? You are fighting one false thing with another falsething, and environment will be false so long as you do not understand it.Therefore, the environment is producing that consciousness which you call the“I,” which is continually trying to become immortal. And to make it immortalthere must be many ways, there must be means, and therefore you have religions,systems, philosophies, all the nuisances and barriers that you have created.Hence, there must be conflict between the result of environment and environmentitself; and, as I said, there can be conflict only between the false and thefalse; never between truth and the false, whereas in your minds there is thisfirmly established idea that in this struggle between the result of environment,which is the “I,” and the environment itself, lies power, wisdom, the path toeternity, to reality, truth, happiness.Our vital concern should be with this environment, not with the conflict, nothow to overcome it, not how to run away from it. By questioning the environmentand trying to understand its significance, we shall find out its true worth.Isn’t that so? Most of us are enmeshed, caught up in the process of trying toovercome, to run away from circumstances, environment; we are not trying to findout what it means, what is its cause, its significance, its value. When you seethe significance of environment, it means drastic action, a tremendous upheavalin your life, a complete, revolutionary change of ideas, in which there is noauthority, no imitation. But very few are willing to see the significance ofenvironment, because it means change, a radical change, a revolutionary change,and very few people want that. So most people, vast numbers of people, areconcerned with the evasion of environment; they cover it up, or try to find newsubstitutions by getting rid of Jesus Christ and setting up a new savior; byseeking new teachers in place of the old, but they do not ever inquire whetherthey need a guide at all. This alone would help, this alone would give the truesignificance of that particular demand.So where there is a search for substitution, there must be authority, thefollowing of leadership, and hence the individual becomes but a cog in thesocial and religious machinery of life. If you look closely you will see thatyour search is nothing but a search for comfort and security and escape; not asearch for understanding, not a search for truth, but rather a search for anevasion and, therefore, a search for the conquering of all obstacles; after all,all conquering is but substitution, and in substitution there is nounderstanding.There are escapes through religions, with their edicts, moral standards, fears,authorities; and escapes through self-expression; what you call self-expression,what the vast majority of people call self-expression, is but the reactionagainst environment, is but the effort to express oneself through reactionagainst that environment—self-expression through art, through science, throughvarious forms of action. Here I am not including the true, spontaneousexpressions of beauty, of art, of science; they in themselves are complete. I amtalking of the man who is seeking these things as a means of self-expression. Areal artist does not talk about his self-expression, he is expressing that whichhe intensely feels; but there are so many spurious artists, like the spuriousspiritual people, who are all the time seeking self-expression as a means ofgetting something, some satisfaction which they cannot find in the environmentin which they live.Through this search for security and permanency, we have establishedreligions—with all their inanities, divisions, exploitations—as means of escape;and these means of escape become so vital, so important, because, to tackleenvironment, that is, the conditions about us, demands tremendous action,voluntary, dynamic action, and very few are willing to take that action. On thecontrary, you are willing to be forced to an action by environment, bycircumstances; that is, if a man becomes highly moral and virtuous throughdepression, you say what a nice man he is, how he has changed. For that changeyou depend upon environment; and so long as there is the dependence onenvironment for righteous action, there must be means of escape, substitutions,call it religion or what you will, whereas for the true artist, who is alsotruly spiritual, there is spontaneous expression, which in itself is sufficient,complete, whole.So what are you doing? What is happening to each one of you? What are you tryingto do in your lives? You are seeking; and what are you seeking? There is aconflict between yourself and the constant movement of environment. You areseeking a means to overcome that environment, so as to perpetuate your own self,which is but the result of that environment; or, because you have been thwartedso often by environment, which prevents you from self-expressing, as you callit, you seek a new means of self-expression through service to humanity, througheconomic adjustments, and all the rest of it.Each one has to find out for what he is searching; if he is not searching, thenthere is satisfaction and decay. If there is conflict, there is the desire toovercome that conflict, to escape from that conflict, to dominate it. And as Ihave said, conflict can exist only between two false things, between thatsupposed reality which you call the “I,” which to me is nothing else but theresult of environment, and the environment itself. If your mind is merelyconcerned with the overcoming of that struggle, then you are perpetuatingfalseness and hence, there is more conflict, more sorrow. But if you understandthe significance of environment, that is, wealth, poverty, exploitation,oppression, nationalities, religions, and all the inanities of social life inmodern existence, not trying to overcome them but seeing their significance,then there must be individual action, and complete revolution of ideas andthought. Then there is no longer a struggle, but rather light dispellingdarkness. There is no conflict between light and darkness. There is no conflictbetween truth and that which is false. There is only conflict where there areopposites.Ojai, California, June 16, 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ENVIRONMENT [index_split_001.html#filepos1985] You may remember that yesterday I was talking about the birth of conflict, andhow the mind seeks a solution for it. I want to deal this morning with the wholeidea of conflict and disharmony, and show the utter futility of mind trying toseek a solution for conflict, because the mere search for the solution will notdo away with the conflict itself. When you seek a solution, a means ofdissolving the conflict, you merely try to superimpose, or substitute in itsplace, a new set of ideas, a new set of theories, or you try to run away fromconflict altogether. When people desire a solution for their conflict, that iswhat they seek.If you observe, you will see that when there is conflict, you are at onceseeking a solution for it. You want to find a way out of that conflict, and yougenerally do find a way out; but you have not solved the conflict, you havemerely shifted it by substituting a new environment, a new condition, which willin turn produce further conflict. So let us look into this whole idea ofconflict, from where it arises, and what we can do with it.Now, conflict is the result of environment, isn’t it? To put it differently,what is environment? When are you conscious of environment? Only when there isconflict and a resistance to that environment. So, if you observe, if you lookinto your lives, you will see that conflict is continually twisting, perverting,shaping your lives; and intelligence, which is the perfect harmony of mind andheart, has no part in your lives at all. That is, environment is continuallyshaping, molding your lives to action, and naturally out of that continualtwisting, molding, shaping, perversion, conflict is born. So where there is thisconstant process of conflict there cannot be intelligence. And yet we think thatby continually going through conflict we shall arrive at that intelligence, thatfullness, and that plenitude of ecstasy. But by the accumulation of conflict wecannot find out how to live intelligently; you can find out how to liveintelligently only when you understand the environment which is creatingconflict, and mere substitution, that is, the introduction of new conditions, isnot going to solve the conflict. And yet if you observe, you will see that whenthere is conflict, mind is seeking a substitution. We either say, “It isheredity, economic conditions, past environment,” or we assert our belief inkarma, reincarnation, evolution; so we are trying to give excuses for thepresent conflict in which the mind is caught, and are not trying to find outwhat is the cause of conflict itself, which is to inquire into the significanceof environment.Conflict then can exist only between environment—environment being economic andsocial conditions, political domination, neighbors—between that environment, andthe result of environment, which is the “I.” Conflict can exist only so long asthere is reaction to that environment which produces the “I,” the self. Themajority of people are unconscious of this conflict—the conflict between one’sself, which is but the result of the environment, and the environment itself;very few are conscious of this continuous battle. One becomes conscious of thatconflict, that disharmony, that struggle between the false creation of theenvironment, which is the “I,” and the environment itself, only throughsuffering. Isn’t that so? It is only through acuteness of suffering, acutenessof pain, acuteness of disharmony, that you become conscious of the conflict.What happens when you become conscious of the conflict? What happens when inthat intensity of suffering you become fully conscious of the battle, thestruggle which is going on? Most people want an immediate relief, an immediateanswer. They want to shelter themselves from that suffering and, therefore, theyfind various means of escape such as religions, excitements, inanities, and themany mysterious avenues of escape which we have created through our desire toprotect ourselves from this struggle. Suffering makes one conscious of thisconflict, and yet suffering will not lead man to that fullness, to thatrichness, that plenitude, that ecstasy of life, because after all, suffering canonly awaken the mind to great intensity. And when the mind is acute, then itbegins to question—the environment, the conditions, and in that questioning,intelligence is functioning; and it is only intelligence that will lead man tothe fullness of life and to the discovery of the significance of sorrow.Intelligence begins to function in the moment of acuteness of suffering, whenmind and heart are no longer escaping, escaping through the various avenueswhich you have so cleverly made, which are so apparently reasonable, factual,real. If you observe carefully, without prejudice, you will see that so long asthere is an escape you are not solving, you are not coming face-to-face withconflict and, therefore, your suffering is merely the accumulating of ignorance.That is, when one ceases to escape, through the well-known channels, then inthat acuteness of suffering, intelligence begins to function.Please, I do not want to give you examples and similes, because I want you tothink it out, and if I give examples I do all the thinking and you merelylisten, whereas if you begin to think about what I am saying, you will see, youwill observe for yourself how mind, being accustomed to so many substitutions,authorities, escapes, never comes to that point of acuteness of suffering whichdemands that intelligence must function. And it is only when intelligence isfully functioning that there can be the utter dissolution of the cause ofconflict.Whenever there is the lack of understanding of environment there must beconflict. Environment gives birth to conflict, and so long as we do notunderstand environment, conditions, surroundings, and are merely seekingsubstitutions for these conditions, we are evading one conflict and meetinganother. But if in that acuteness of suffering which brings forth in itsfullness a conflict, if in that state we begin to question environment, then weshall understand the true worth of environment, and intelligence then functionsnaturally. Hitherto mind has identified itself with conflict, with environment,with evasions and, therefore, with suffering; that is, you say, “I suffer,”whereas in that state of acuteness of suffering, in that intensity of sufferingin which there is no longer escape, mind itself becomes intelligence.To put it again differently, so long as we are seeking solutions, so long as weare seeking substitutions, authorities for the cause and the alleviation ofconflict, there must be identification of the mind with the particular; whereasif the mind is in that state of intense suffering in which all the avenues ofescape are blocked, then intelligence will be awakened, will function naturallyand spontaneously.Please, if you experiment with this, you will see that I am not giving youtheories, but something with which you can work, something which is practical.You have so many environments, which have been imposed on you by society, byreligion, by economic conditions, by social distinctions, by exploitation, andpolitical oppressions. The “I” has been created by that imposition, by thatcompulsion; there is the “I” in you which is fighting the environment and hence,there is conflict. It is no use creating a new environment, because the samething will still exist. But if in that conflict there is conscious sorrow andsuffering—and there is always suffering in all conflict, only man wants to runaway from that struggle and he therefore seeks substitutes—if in that acutenessof suffering you stop searching for substitutes and really face the facts, youwill see that mind, which is the summation of intelligence, begins to discoverthe true worth of environment, and then you will realize that mind is free ofconflict. In the very acuteness of suffering lies its own dissolution. Sotherein is the understanding of the cause of conflict.Also, one should bear in mind that what we call accumulation of sorrows does notlead to intensity, nor does the multiplication of suffering lead to its owndissolution; for acuteness of mind in suffering comes only when the mind hasceased to escape. And no conflict will awaken that suffering, that acuteness ofsuffering, when the mind is trying to escape, for in escape there is nointelligence.To put it briefly again, before I answer the questions that have been given tome: First of all, everyone is caught up in suffering and conflict, but mostpeople are unconscious of that conflict; they are merely seeking substitutions,solutions, and escapes, whereas if they cease seeking escapes and begin toquestion the environment which causes that conflict, then mind becomes acute,alive, intelligent. In that intensity mind becomes intelligence and, therefore,sees the full worth and significance of the environment, which creates conflict.Please, I am sure half of you don’t understand this, but it doesn’t matter. Whatyou can do, if you will, is to think this over, really think over it, and see ifwhat I am saying is not true. But to think over it is not to intellectualize it,that is, to sit down and make it vanish away through the intellect. To find outif what I am saying is true, you have to put it into action, and to put it intoaction you must question the environment. That is, if you are in conflict,naturally you must question the environment, but most minds have become soperverted that they are not aware that they are seeking solutions, escapesthrough their marvelous theories. They reason perfectly, but their reasoning isbased on the search for escape, of which they are wholly unconscious.So if there is conflict, and if you want to find out the cause of that conflict,naturally the mind must discover it through acuteness of thought and, therefore,the questioning of all that which environment places about you—your family, yourneighbors, your religions, your political authorities; and by questioning therewill be action against the environment. There is the family, the neighbor andthe state, and by questioning their significance you will see that intelligenceis spontaneous, not to be acquired, not to be cultivated. You have sown the seedof awareness and that produces the flower of intelligence.QUESTIONER: You say that the “I” is the product of environment. Do you mean thata perfect environment could be created which would not develop the “I”consciousness? If so, the perfect freedom of which you speak is a matter ofcreating the right environment. Is this correct?KRISHNAMURTI: Wait a minute. Can there ever be right environment, perfectenvironment? There cannot. So let us reason together, go into it fully.What is environment? Environment is created, this whole human structure has beencreated, by human fears, longings, hopes, desires, attainments. Now, you cannotmake a perfect environment because each man is creating, according to hisfancies and desires, new sets of conditions; but having an intelligent mind, youcan pierce through all these false environments and, therefore, be free of that“I” consciousness. Please, the “I” consciousness, the sense of “mine,” is theresult of environment, isn’t it? I don’t think we need discuss it because it ispretty obvious.If the state gave you your house and everything you required, there would be noneed of “my house”; there might be some other sense of “mine,” but we arediscussing the particular. As that has not been the case with you, there is thesense of “mine,” possessiveness. That is the result of environment; that “I” isbut the false reaction to environment, whereas if the mind begins to questionthe environment itself, there is no longer a reaction to environment. Therefore,we are not concerned with the possibility of there ever being a perfectenvironment.After all, what is perfect environment? Each man will tell you what to him is aperfect environment. The artist will say one thing, the financier another, thecinema actress another; each man asks for a perfect environment which satisfieshim, in other words, which does not create conflict in him. Therefore, therecannot be a perfect environment. But if there is intelligence, then environmenthas no value, no significance, because intelligence is then freed fromcircumstance; it is functioning fully.The question is not whether we can create a perfect environment, but rather howto awaken that intelligence which shall be free of environment, imperfect orperfect. I say you can awaken that intelligence by questioning the full value ofany environment in which your mind is caught up. Then you will see that you arefree of any particular environment, because then you are functioningintelligently, not being twisted, perverted, shaped by environment.Q: Surely you cannot mean what your words seem to convey. When I see vicerampant in the world, I feel an intense desire to fight against that vice andagainst all the suffering it creates in the lives of my fellow human beings.This means great conflict, for when I try to help I am often viciously opposed.How then can you say that there is no conflict between the false and the true?K: I said yesterday that there can be struggle only between two false things,conflict between the environment and the result of environment, which is the“I.” Now between these two lie innumerable avenues of escape, which the “I” hascreated, which we call vice, goodness, morality, moral standards, fears, and allthe many opposites; and the struggle can exist only between the two, between thefalse creation of the environment, which is the “I,” and the environment itself.But there cannot be struggle between truth and that which is false. Surely thatis obvious, isn’t it? You may be viciously opposed because the other man isignorant. It doesn’t mean you mustn’t fight—but don’t assume the righteousnessof fighting. Please, you know there is a natural way of doing things, aspontaneous, sweet way of doing things, without this aggressive, viciousrighteousness.First of all, in order to fight, you must know what you are fighting, so theremust be understanding of the fundamental, not of the divisions between the falsethings. Now we are so conscious, we are so fully conscious of the divisionsbetween the false things, between the result and the environment, that we fightthem and, therefore, we want to reform, we want to change, we want to alter,without fundamentally changing the whole structure of human life. That is, westill want to preserve the “I” consciousness which is the false reaction toenvironment; we want to preserve that and yet want to alter the world. In otherwords, you want to have your own bank account, your own possessions; you want topreserve the sense of “mine,” and yet you want to alter the world so that thereshall not be this idea of “mine” and “yours.”So what one has to do is to find out if one is dealing with the fundamental, ormerely with the superficial. And to me the superficial will exist so long as youare merely concerned with the alteration of environment so as to alleviateconflict. That is, you still want to cling to the “I” consciousness as “mine,”but yet desire to alter the circumstances so that they will not create conflictin that “I.” I call that superficial thought, and from that there naturally issuperficial action, whereas if you think fundamentally, that is, question thevery result of the environment, which is the “I” and, therefore, question theenvironment itself, then you are acting fundamentally and, therefore, lastingly.And in that there is an ecstasy, in that there is a joy of which now you do notknow because you are afraid to act fundamentally.Q: In your talk yesterday you spoke of environment as the movement of the false.Do you include in environment all the creations of nature, including humanforms?K: Doesn’t environment continually change? Doesn’t it? For most people itdoesn’t change because change implies continual adjustment and, therefore,continual awareness of mind, and most people are concerned with the staticcondition of the environment. Yet environment is moving because it is beyondyour control, and it is false so long as you do not understand its significance.Does environment include human forms? Why set them apart from nature? We are notconcerned so much with nature, because we have almost brought nature undercontrol, but we have not understood the environment created by human beings.Look at the relationship between peoples, between two human beings, and all theconditions which human beings have created that we have not understood, eventhough we have largely understood and conquered nature through science.So we are not concerned with the stability, with the continuance, of anenvironment which we understand, because the moment we understand it there is noconflict. That is, we are seeking security, emotional and mental, and we arehappy so long as that security is assured and, therefore, we never questionenvironment, and hence the constant movement of environment is a false thingwhich is creating disturbance in each one. As long as there is conflict, itindicates that we have not understood the conditions placed about us; and thatmovement of environment remains false so long as we do not inquire into itssignificance, and we can only discover it in that state of acute consciousnessof suffering.Q: It is perfectly clear to me that the “I” consciousness is the result ofenvironment, but do you not see that the “I” did not originate for the firsttime in this life? From what you say it is obvious that the “I” consciousness,being the result of environment, must have begun in the distant past and willcontinue in the future.K: I know this is a question to catch me about reincarnation. But that doesn’tmatter. Now let’s look into it. First of all, you will admit, if you think aboutit, that the “I” is the result of environment. Now to me it doesn’t matterwhether it is the past environment or present environment. After all,environment is of the past also. You have done something which you haven’tunderstood, you did something yesterday which you haven’t understood, and thatpursues you until you understand it. You cannot solve that past environment tillyou are fully conscious in the present. So it doesn’t matter whether the mind iscrippled by past or present conditions. What matters is that you shallunderstand the environment and this will liberate the mind from conflict.Some people believe that the “I” has had a birth in the distant past and willcontinue in the future. It is irrelevant to me, it has no significance at all. Iwill show you why. If the “I” is the result of the environment, if the “I” isbut the essence of conflict, then the mind must be concerned not with thatcontinuance of conflict, but with freedom from that conflict. So it does notmatter whether it is the past environment which is crippling the mind, or thepresent which is perverting it, or whether the “I” has had a birth in thedistant past. What matters is that in that state of suffering, in thatconsciousness, that conscious acuteness of suffering, there is the dissolutionof the “I.”This brings in the idea of karma. You know what it means, that you have a burdenin the present, the burden of the past in the present. That is, you bring withyou the environment of the past into the present, and because of that burden,you control the future, you shape the future. If you come to think of it, itmust be so, that if your mind is perverted by the past, naturally the futuremust also be twisted, because if you have not understood the environment ofyesterday it must be continued today and, therefore, as you don’t understandtoday, naturally you will not understand tomorrow either. That is, if you havenot seen the full significance of an environment or of an action, this pervertsyour judgment of today’s environment, of today’s action born of environment,which will again pervert you tomorrow. So one is caught up in this viciouscircle, and hence the idea of continual rebirth, rebirth of memory, or rebirthof the mind continued by environment.But I say mind can be free of the past, of past environment, past hindrancesand, therefore, you can be free of the future, because then you are livingdynamically in the present, intensely, supremely. In the present is eternity,and to understand that, mind must be free of the burden of the past; and to freethe mind of the past there must be an intense questioning of the present, notthe considering of how the “I” will continue in the future.Ojai, California, June 17, 1934"},{"pageContent":"A DYNAMIC SOCIETY [index_split_001.html#filepos2146] Today, we are going to answer questions.QUESTIONER: What is the difference between self-discipline and suppression?KRISHNAMURTI: I don’t think there is much difference between the two becauseboth deny intelligence. Suppression is the gross form of the subtlerself-discipline, which is also repression; that is, both suppression as well asself-discipline are mere adjustments to environment. One is the gross form ofadjustment, which is suppression, and the other, self-discipline, is the subtleform. Both are based on fear: suppression, on an obvious fear; the other,self-discipline, on fear born of loss, or on fear which expresses itself throughgain.Self-discipline—what you call self-discipline—is merely an adjustment to anenvironment which we have not completely understood; therefore, in thatadjustment there must be the denial of intelligence. Why has one ever todiscipline one’s self? Why does one discipline, force one’s self to mold after aparticular pattern? Why do so many people belong to the various schools ofdisciplines, supposed to lead to spirituality, to greater understanding, greaterunfoldment of thought? You will see that the more you discipline the mind, trainthe mind, the greater its limitations. Please, one has to think this overcarefully and with delicate perception and not get confused by introducing otherissues. Here I am using the word self-discipline as in the question, that is,disciplining one’s self after a certain pattern, preconceived or preestablishedand, therefore, with the desire to attain, to gain, whereas to me the veryprocess of discipline, this continual twisting of mind to a particularpreestablished pattern, must eventually cripple the mind. The mind, which isreally intelligent, is free of self-discipline, for intelligence is born out ofthe questioning of environment and the discovery of the true significance ofenvironment. In that discovery is true adjustment, not the adjustment to aparticular pattern or condition, but the adjustment through understanding, whichis, therefore, free of the particular condition.Take a primitive man; what does he do? In him there is no discipline, nocontrol, no suppression. He does what he desires to do, this primitive. Theintelligent man also does what he desires, but with intelligence. Intelligenceis not born out of self-discipline or suppression. In the one instance it iswholly the pursuit of desire, the primitive man pursuing the object he desires.In the other instance, the intelligent man sees the significance of desire andsees the conflict; the primitive man does not, he pursues anything he desiresand creates suffering and pain. So to me self-discipline and suppression areboth alike—they both deny intelligence.Please experiment with what I have said about discipline, self-discipline. Don’treject it, don’t say you must have self-discipline, because there will be chaosin the world—as if there were not already chaos; and again, don’t merely acceptwhat I say, agreeing that it is true. I am telling you something with which Ihave experimented and which I have found to be true. Psychologically I think itis true, because self-discipline implies a mind that is tethered to a particularthought or belief or ideal, a mind that is held by a condition; and as an animalthat is tethered to a post can only wander within the distance of its rope, sodoes the mind which is tethered to a belief, which is perverted throughself-discipline, wander only within the limitation of that condition. Therefore,such a mind is not mind at all, it is incapable of thought. It may be capable ofadjustment between the limitations of the post and the farthest point of itsreach; but such a mind, such a heart cannot really think and feel. The mind andthe heart are disciplined, crippled, perverted, through denying thought, denyingaffection. So you must observe, become aware how your own thought, how your ownfeelings are functioning, without wanting to guide them in any particulardirection. First of all, before you guide them, find out how they arefunctioning. Before you try to change and alter thought and feeling, find outthe manner of their working, and you will see that they are continuallyadjusting themselves within the limitations established by that point fixed bydesire and the fulfillment of that desire. In awareness there is no discipline.Let me take an example. Suppose that you are class-minded, class-conscious,snobbish. You don’t know that you are snobbish, but you want to find out if youare; how will you find out? By becoming conscious of your thought and youremotions. Then what happens? Suppose that you discover that you are snobbish,then that very discovery creates a disturbance, a conflict, and that veryconflict dissolves snobbishness, whereas if you merely discipline the mind notto be snobbish, you are developing a different characteristic which is theopposite of being a snob, and being deliberate, therefore false, is equallypernicious.So, because we have established various patterns, various goals, aids, which weare continually—consciously or unconsciously—pursuing, we discipline our mindsand hearts toward them and, therefore, there must be control, perversion,whereas if you begin to inquire into the conditions that create conflict, andthereby awaken intelligence, then that intelligence itself is so supreme that itis continually in movement and, therefore, there is never a static point whichcan create conflict.Q: Granted that the “I” is made up of reactions from environment, by what methodcan one escape its limitations; or how does one go about the process ofreorientation, in order to avoid conflict between the two false things?K: First of all, you want to know the method of escape from the limitations.Why? Why do you ask? Please, why do you always ask for a method, for a system?What does it indicate, this desire for a method? Every demand for a methodindicates the desire to escape. You want me to lay down a system so that you mayimitate that system. In other words, you want a system invented for you tosuperimpose on those conditions which are creating conflict, so that you canescape from all conflict. In other words you merely seek to adjust yourselves toa pattern, in order to escape from conflict or from your environment. That isthe desire behind the demand for a method, for a system. You know life is notPelmanism. The desire for a method indicates essentially the desire to escape.How does one go about the process of reorientation in order to avoid constantconflict between the two false things? First of all, are you aware that you arein conflict, before you want to know how to get away from it? Or, being aware ofconflict, are you merely seeking a refuge, a shelter which will not createfurther conflict? So let us decide whether you want a shelter, a safety zone,which will no longer yield conflict, whether you want to escape from the presentconflict to enter a condition in which there shall be no conflict; or whetheryou are unaware, unconscious of this conflict in which you exist. If you areunconscious of the conflict, that is, the battle that is taking place betweenthat self and the environment, if you are unconscious of that battle, then whydo you seek further remedies? Remain unconscious. Let the conditions themselvesproduce the necessary conflict, without your rushing after, invokingartificially, falsely, a conflict which does not exist in your mind and heart.And you create artificially a conflict because you are afraid you are missingsomething. Life will not miss you. If you think it does, something is wrong withyou. Perhaps you are neurotic, not normal.If you are in conflict, you will not ask me for a method. Were I to give you amethod you would merely be disciplining yourself according to that method,trying to imitate an ideal, a pattern which I have laid down and, therefore,destroying your own intelligence, whereas if you are really conscious of thatconflict, in that consciousness suffering will become acute and in thatacuteness, in that intensity, you will dissolve the cause of suffering, which isthe lack of understanding of the environment.You know we have lost all sense of living normally, simply, directly. To getback to that normality, that simplicity, that directness, you cannot followmethods, you cannot merely become automatic machines; and I am afraid most of usare seeking methods because we think that through them we shall realizefullness, stability, and permanency. To me methods lead to slow stagnation anddecay and they have nothing to do with real spirituality, which is, after all,the summation of intelligence.Q: You speak of the necessity of a drastic revolution in the life of theindividual. If he does not want to revolutionize his outward personalenvironment because of the suffering it would cause to his family and friends,will inward revolution lead him to the freedom from all conflict?K: First of all, sirs, don’t you also feel that a drastic revolution in the lifeof the individual is necessary? Or are you merely satisfied with things as theyare, with your ideas of progress, evolution, and your desire for attainment,with your longings and fluctuating pleasures? You know, the moment you begin tothink, really begin to feel, you must have this burning desire for a drasticchange, drastic revolution, complete reorientation of thinking. Now, if you feelthat that is necessary, then neither family nor friends will stand in the way.Then there is neither an outward revolution nor an inward revolution; there isonly revolution, change. But the moment you begin to limit it by saying, “I mustnot hurt my family, my friends, my priest, my capitalistic exploiter or stateexploiter,” then you really don’t see the necessity for radical change, youmerely seek a change of environment. In that there is merely lethargy, whichcreates further false environment and continues the conflict.I think we give the rather false excuse that we must not hurt our families andour friends. You know when you want to do something vital, you do it,irrespective of your family and friends, don’t you? Then you don’t consider thatyou are going to hurt them. It is beyond your control; you feel so intensely,you think so completely that it carries you beyond the limitation of familycircles, classified bondages. But you begin to consider family, friends, ideals,beliefs, traditions, the established order of things, only when you are stillclinging to a particular safety, when there is not that inward richness, butmerely the dependence on external stimulation for that inward richness. So ifthere is that full consciousness of suffering, brought about by conflict, thenyou are not held in the bondage of any particular orthodoxy, friends, or family.You want to find out the cause of that suffering, you want to find out thesignificance of the environment which creates that conflict; then in that thereis no personality, no limited thought of the “I.” But it is only when you clingto that limited thought of the “I” that you have to consider how far you shallwander and how far you shall not wander.Surely truth, or that Godhead of understanding, is not to be found by clingingeither to family or tradition or habit. It is to be found only when you arecompletely naked, stripped of your longings, hopes, securities; and in thatdirect simplicity is the richness of life.Q: Can you explain why environment started being false instead of true? What isthe origin of all this mess and trouble?K: Who do you think created environment? Some mysterious God? Please, just aminute; who created environment, the social structure, the economic, thereligious structure? We. Each one has contributed individually, until it hasbecome collective, and the individual who has helped to create the collectivenow is lost in the collective, for it has become his mold, his environment.Through the desire for security—financial, moral, and spiritual—you have createda capitalistic environment in which there is nationality, class distinction, andexploitation. We have created it, you and I. This thing hasn’t miraculously comeinto being. You will again create another capitalistic, acquisitive system of adifferent kind, with a different nuance, with a different color, so long as youare seeking security. You may abolish this present pattern, but so long as thereis possessiveness, you will create another capitalistic state, with a newphraseology, a new jargon.And the same thing applies to religions, with all their absurd ceremonies,exploitations, fears. Who has created them? You and I. Throughout the centurieswe have created these things and yielded to them through fear. It is theindividual who has created false environment everywhere. And he has become aslave, and that false condition has resulted in a false search for the securityof that self-consciousness which you call the “I,” and hence, the constantbattle between the “I” and the false environment.You want to know who has created this environment and all this appalling messand trouble, because you want a redeemer to lift you out of that trouble and setyou in a new heaven. Clinging to all your particular prejudices, hopes, fears,and preferences, you have individually created this environment, so individuallyyou must break it down and not wait for a system to come and sweep it away. Asystem will probably come and sweep it away and then you will merely becomeslaves to that system. The communistic system may come in, and then probably youwill be using new words, but having the same reactions, only in a differentmanner, with a different tempo.That is why I said the other day that if environment is driving you to a certainaction, it is no longer righteous. It is only when there is action born out ofthe understanding of that environment that there is righteousness.So individually we must become conscious. I assure you, you will thenindividually create something immense, not a society which is merely holding toan ideal and, therefore, decaying, but a society that is constantly in movement,not coming to a culmination and dying. Individuals establish a goal, striveafter its attainment, and after attaining, collapse. They try all the time toreach some goal and stay at that stage which they have attained. As theindividual so the state—the state is trying all the time to reach an ideal, agoal, whereas to me the individual must be in constant movement, must ever bebecoming, not seeking a culmination, not pursuing a goal. Then self-expression,which is society, will be ever in constant movement.Q: Do you consider that karma is the interaction between the false environmentand the false “I”?K: You know karma is a Sanskrit word which means to act, to do, to work, andalso it implies cause and effect. Now karma is the bondage, the reaction bornout of the environment, which the mind has not understood. As I tried to explainyesterday, if we do not understand a particular condition, naturally the mind isburdened with that condition, with that lack of understanding; and with thatlack of understanding we function and act and, therefore, create furtherburdens, greater limitations.So one has to find out what creates this lack of understanding, what preventsthe individual from gathering the full significance of the environment, whetherit be the past environment or the present. And to discover that significance,mind must really be free of prejudice. It is one of the most difficult things tobe really free of a bias, of a temperament, of a twist; and to approachenvironment with a fresh openness, a directness, demands a great deal ofperception. Most minds are biased through vanity, through the desire to impressothers by being somebody, or through the desire to attain truth, or to escapefrom their environment, or expand their own consciousness—only they call this bya special spiritual name—or through their national prejudices. All these desiresprevent the mind from perceiving directly the full worth of the environment; andas most minds are prejudiced, the first thing that one has to become consciousof is one’s own limitations. And when you begin to be conscious, there isconflict in that consciousness. When you know that you are really brutally proudor conceited, in the very consciousness of conceit it begins to dissipate,because you perceive the absurdity of it; but if you begin merely to cover itup, it creates further diseases, further false reactions.So to live each moment now without the burden of the past or of the present,without that crippling memory created by the lack of understanding, mind mustever meet things anew. It is fatal to meet life with the burden of certainty,with the conceit of knowledge, because, after all, knowledge is merely a thingof the past. So when you come to that life with a freshness, then you will knowwhat it is to live without conflict, without this continual straining effort.Then you wander far on the floods of life.Ojai, California, June 18, 1934"},{"pageContent":"LIVING IN ECSTASY [index_split_001.html#filepos2293] To me there is a reality, an immense living truth; and to comprehend that, theremust be utter simplicity of thought. What is simple is infinitely subtle, whatis simple is greatly delicate. There is a great subtlety, an infinite subtletyand delicacy, and if you use words merely as a means of getting to thatdelicacy, to that simplicity of thought, then I am afraid you will notcomprehend what I want to convey. But if you would use the significance of wordsas a bridge to cross, then words will not become an illusion in which the mindis lost.I say there is this living reality, call it God, truth, or what you like, and itcannot be found or realized through search. Where there is the implication ofsearch, there must be contrast and duality; whenever mind is seeking, it mustinevitably imply a division, a distinction, a contrast, which does not mean thatmind must be contented, mind must be stagnant. There is that delicate poise,which is neither contentment, nor this ceaseless effort born of search, of thisdesire to attain, to achieve; and in that delicacy of poise lies simplicity, notthe simplicity of having but few clothes or few possessions. I am not talking ofsuch simplicity, which is merely a crude form, but of simplicity born of thisdelicacy of thought, in which there is neither search nor contentment.As I said, search implies duality, contrast. Now where there is contrast,duality, there must be identification with one of the opposites, and from thisthere arises compulsion. When we say we search, our mind is rejecting somethingand seeking a substitute that will satisfy it, and thereby it creates duality,and from this there arises compulsion. That is, the choice of the one is theovercoming of the other, isn’t it?When we say we seek out or cultivate a new value, it is but the overcoming ofthat in which the mind is already caught up, which is its opposite. This choiceis based on attraction to one or fear of the other, and this clinging throughattraction, or rejection through fear, creates influence over the mind.Influence then is the negation of understanding and can exist only where thereis division, the psychological division from which there arise distinctions suchas class, national, religious, sex. That is, when the mind is trying toovercome, it must create duality, and that very duality negates understandingand creates the distinctions. That duality influences the mind, and hence a mindinfluenced by duality cannot understand the significance of environment or thesignificance of the cause of conflict. These psychological influences are merelyreactions to environment from that center of “I” consciousness, of like anddislike, or antitheses, and naturally where there are antitheses, opposites,there can be no comprehension. From this distinction there arises theclassification of influences as beneficial and evil. So as long as mind isinfluenced—and influence is born of attraction, opposites, antitheses—there mustbe the domination or compulsion of love, of intellect, of society; and thisinfluence must be a hindrance to that understanding which is beauty, truth, andlove itself.Now, if you can become aware of this influence, then you can discern its cause.Most people seem to be aware superficially, not at the greatest depth. It isonly when there is awareness at the greatest depth of consciousness, of thoughtand emotion, that you can discern the division that is created throughinfluence, which negates understanding.QUESTIONER: After listening to your talk about memory, I have completely lostmine, and I find I cannot remember my huge debts. I feel blissful. Is thisliberation?KRISHNAMURTI: Ask the person to whom you owe the money. I am afraid that thereis some confusion with regard to what I have been trying to say concerningmemory. If you rely on memory as a guide to conduct, as a means of activity inlife, then that memory must impede your action, your conduct, because then thataction or conduct is merely the result of calculation and, therefore, it has nospontaneity, no richness, no fullness of life. It does not mean that you mustforget your debts. You cannot forget the past. You cannot blot it out of yourmind. That is an impossibility. Subconsciously it will exist, but if thatsubconscious, dormant memory is influencing you unconsciously, is molding youraction, your conduct, your whole outlook on life, then that influence must everbe creating further limitations, imposing further burdens on the functioning ofintelligence.For example, I have recently come from India; I have been to Australia and NewZealand, where I met various people, had many ideas and saw many sights. I can’tforget these, though the memory of them may fade. But the reaction to the pastmay impede my full comprehension in the present; it may hinder the intelligentfunctioning of my mind. That is, if my experiences and remembrances of the pastare becoming hindrances in the present through their reaction, then I cannotcomprehend or live fully, intensely, in the present.You react to the past because the present has lost its significance, or becauseyou want to avoid the present; so you go back to the past and live in thatemotional thrill, in that reaction of surging memory, because the present haslittle value. So when you say, “I have completely lost my memory,” I am afraidyou are fit for only one place. You cannot lose memory, but by living completelyin the present, in the fullness of the moment, you become conscious of all thesubconscious entanglements of memory, the dormant hopes and longings which surgeforward and prevent you from functioning intelligently in the present. If youare aware of that, if you are aware of that hindrance, aware of it at its depth,not superficially, then the dormant subconscious memory, which is but the lackof understanding and incompleteness of living, disappears and, therefore, youmeet each movement of environment, each swiftness of thought, anew.Q: You say that the complete understanding of the outer and inner environment ofthe individual releases him from bondage and sorrow. Now, even in that state,how can one free himself from the indescribable sorrow which in the nature ofthings is caused by the death of someone he really loves?K: What is the cause of suffering in this case? And what is it that we callsuffering? Isn’t suffering merely a shock to the mind to awaken it to its owninsufficiency? The recognition of that insufficiency creates what we callsorrow. Suppose that you have been relying on your son or your husband or yourwife to satisfy that insufficiency, that incompleteness; by the loss of thatperson whom you love, there is created the full consciousness of that emptiness,of that void, and out of that consciousness comes sorrow, and you say, “I havelost somebody.”So through death there is, first of all, the full consciousness of emptiness,which you have been carefully evading. Hence, where there is dependence theremust be emptiness, shallowness, insufficiency and, therefore, sorrow and pain.We don’t want to recognize that; we don’t see that that is the fundamentalcause. So we begin to say, “I miss my friend, my husband, my wife, my child. Howam I to overcome this loss? How am I to overcome this sorrow?”Now, all overcoming is but substitution. In that there is no understanding and,therefore, there can only be further sorrow, though momentarily you may find asubstitution that will completely put the mind to sleep. If you don’t seek anovercoming, then you turn to seances, mediums, or take shelter in the scientificproof that life continues after death. So you begin to discover various means ofescape and substitution, which momentarily relieve you from suffering, whereasif there were the cessation of this desire to overcome and if there were reallythe desire to understand—to find out, fundamentally—what causes pain and sorrow,then you would discover that so long as there is loneliness, shallowness,emptiness, insufficiency, which in its outer expression is dependence, theremust be pain. And you cannot fill that insufficiency by overcoming obstacles, bysubstitutions, by escaping or by accumulating, which is merely the cunning ofthe mind lost in the pursuit of gain.Suffering is merely that high, intense clarity of thought and emotion whichforces you to recognize things as they are. But this does not mean acceptance,resignation. When you see things as they are in the mirror of truth, which isintelligence, then there is a joy, an ecstasy; in that there is no duality, nosense of loss, no division. I assure you this is not theoretical. If youconsider what I am now saying, with my answer to the first question aboutmemory, you will see how memory creates greater and greater dependence, thecontinual looking back to an event emotionally, to get a reaction from it, whichprevents the full expression of intelligence in the present.Q: What suggestion or advice would you give to one who is hindered by strongsexual desire?K: After all, where there is no creative expression of life, we give undueimportance to sex, which becomes an acute problem. So the question is not whatadvice or suggestion I would give, or how one can overcome passion, sexualdesire, but how to release that creative living, and not merely tackle one partof it, which is sex; that is, how to understand the wholeness, the completenessof life.Now, through modern education, through circumstances and environment, you aredriven to do something which you hate. You are repelled, but you are forced todo it because of your lack of proper equipment, proper training. In your workyou are being prevented by circumstances, by conditions, from expressingyourself fundamentally, creatively, and so there must be an outlet; and thisoutlet becomes the sex problem or the drink problem or some idiotic, inaneproblem. All these outlets become problems.Or you are artistically inclined. There are very few artists, but you may beinclined, and that inclination is continually being perverted, twisted,thwarted, so that you have no means of real self-expression and thus, undueimportance comes to be given either to sex or to some religious mania. Or yourambitions are thwarted, curtailed, hindered, and so again undue importance isgiven to those things that should be normal. So, until you understandcomprehensively your religious, political, economic, and social desires, andtheir hindrances, the natural functions of life will be of immense importance,and the first place in your life. Hence, all the innumerable problems of greed,of possessiveness, of sex, of social and racial distinctions have their falsemeasure and false value. But if you were to deal with life, not in parts but asa whole, comprehensively, creatively, with intelligence, then you would see thatthese problems, which are enervating the mind and destroying creative living,disappear, and then intelligence functions normally, and in that there is anecstasy.Q: I have been under the impression that I have been putting your ideas intoaction; but I have no joy in life, no enthusiasm for any pursuit. My attempts atawareness have not cleared my confusion, nor have they brought any change orvitality into my life. My living has no more meaning for me now than it had whenI started to listen to you seven years ago. What is wrong with me?K: I wonder if the questioner has, first of all, understood what I have beensaying before trying to put my ideas into action. And why should he put my ideasinto action? And what are my ideas? And why are they my ideas? I am not givingyou a mold or a code by which you can live, or a system which you can follow.All that I am saying is, that to live creatively, enthusiastically,intelligently, vitally, intelligence must function. That intelligence isperverted, hindered, by what one calls memory, and I have explained what I meanby that, so I won’t go into it again. So long as there is this constant battleto achieve, so long as mind is influenced, there must be duality, and hence,pain, struggle; and our search for truth or for reality is but an escape fromthat pain.And so I say, become aware that your effort, your struggle, your impingingmemories are destroying your intelligence. To become aware is not to besuperficially conscious, but to go into the full depth of consciousness so asnot to leave undiscovered one unconscious reaction. All this demands thought;all this demands an alertness of mind and heart, not a mind that is cluttered upwith beliefs, creeds, and ideals. Most minds are burdened with these and withthe desire to follow. As you become conscious of your burden, don’t say youmustn’t have ideals, you mustn’t have creeds, and repeat all the rest of thejargon. The very “must” creates another doctrine, another creed; merely becomeconscious and in the intensity of that consciousness, in the intensity ofawareness, in that flame you will create such crisis, such conflict, that thatvery conflict itself will dissolve the hindrance.I know some people come here year after year, and I try to explain these ideasin different ways each year, but I am afraid there is very little thought amongthe people who say, “We have been listening to you for seven years.” I mean bythought, not mere intellectual reasoning, which is but ashes, but that poisebetween emotion and reason, between affection and thought; and that poise is notinfluenced, is not affected, by the conflict of the opposites. But if there isneither the capacity to think clearly, nor the intensity of feeling, how can youawaken, how can there be poise, how can there be this alertness, this awareness?So life becomes futile, inane, worthless.Hence, the very first thing to do, if I may suggest it, is to find out why youare thinking in a certain way, and why you are feeling in a certain manner.Don’t try to alter it, don’t try to analyze your thoughts and your emotions; butbecome conscious of why you are thinking in a particular groove and from whatmotive you act. Although you can discover the motive through analysis, althoughyou may find out something through analysis, it will not be real; it will bereal only when you are intensely aware at the moment of the functioning of yourthought and emotion; then you will see their extraordinary subtlety, their finedelicacy. So long as you have a “must” and a “must not,” in this compulsion youwill never discover that swift wandering of thought and emotion. And I am sureyou have been brought up in the school of “must” and “must not” and hence, youhave destroyed thought and feeling. You have been bound and crippled by systems,methods, by your teachers. So leave all those “musts” and “must nots.” This doesnot mean that there shall be licentiousness, but become aware of a mind that isever saying, “I must,” and “I must not.” Then as a flower blossoms forth of amorning, so intelligence happens, is there, functioning, creating comprehension.Q: The artist is sometimes mentioned as one who has this understanding of whichyou speak, at least while working creatively. But if someone disturbs or crosseshim, he may react violently, excusing his reaction as a manifestation oftemperament. Obviously he is not living completely at the moment. Does he reallyunderstand if he so easily slips back into self-consciousness?K: Who is that person whom you call an artist? A man who is momentarilycreative? To me he is nor an artist. The man who merely at rare moments has thiscreative impulse and expresses that creativeness through perfection oftechnique, surely you would not call him an artist. To me, the true artist isone who lives completely, harmoniously, who does not divide his art from living,whose very life is that expression, whether it be a picture, music, or hisbehavior; who has not divorced his expression on a canvas or in music or instone from his daily conduct, daily living. That demands the highestintelligence, highest harmony. To me the true artist is the man who has thatharmony. He may express it on canvas, or he may talk, or he may paint; or he maynot express it at all, he may feel it. But all this demands that exquisitepoise, that intensity of awareness and, therefore, his expression is notdivorced from the daily continuity of living.Ojai, California, June 29, 1934"},{"pageContent":"TO BE A TRUE HUMAN BEING [index_split_001.html#filepos2440] What we call happiness or ecstasy is, to me, creative thinking. And creativethinking is the infinite movement of thought, emotion, and action. That is, whenthought, which is emotion, which is action itself, is unimpeded in its movement,is not compelled or influenced or bound by an idea, and does not proceed fromthe background of tradition or habit, then that movement is creative. So long asthought—and I won’t repeat each time emotion and action—so long as thought iscircumscribed, held by a fixed idea, or merely adjusts itself to a background orcondition and, therefore, becomes limited, such thought is not creative.So the question which every thoughtful person puts to himself is how can heawaken this creative thinking; because when there is this creative thinking,which is infinite movement, then there can be no idea of a limitation, aconflict.Now this movement of creative thinking does not seek in its expression a result,an achievement; its results and expressions are not its culmination. It has noculmination or goal, for it is eternally in movement. Most minds are seeking aculmination, a goal, an achievement, and are molding themselves upon the idea ofsuccess, and such thought, such thinking is continually limiting itself, whereasif there is no idea of achievement but only the continual movement of thought asunderstanding, as intelligence, then that movement of thought is creative. Thatis, creative thinking ceases when mind is crippled by adjustment throughinfluence, or when it functions with the background of a tradition which it hasnot understood, or from a fixed point, like an animal tied to a post. So long asthis limitation, this adjustment, exists, there cannot be creative thinking,intelligence, which alone is freedom.This creative movement of thought never seeks a result or comes to aculmination, because result or culmination is always the outcome of alternatecessation and movement, whereas if there is no search for a result, but onlycontinual movement of thought, then that is creative thinking.Again, creative thinking is free of division, which creates conflict betweenthought, emotion, and action. And division exists only when there is the searchfor a goal, when there is adjustment and the complacency of certainty.Action is this movement which is itself thought and emotion, as I explained.This action is the relationship between the individual and society. It isconduct, work, cooperation, which we call fulfillment. That is, when mind isfunctioning without seeking a culmination, a goal, and, therefore, thinkingcreatively, that thinking is action, which is the relationship between theindividual and society. Now if this movement of thought is clear, simple,direct, spontaneous, profound, then there is no conflict in the individualagainst society, for action then is the very expression of this living, creativemovement.So to me there is no art of thinking, there is only creative thinking. There isno technique of thinking, but only spontaneous creative functioning ofintelligence, which is the harmony of reason, emotion, and action, not dividedor divorced from each other.Now this thinking and feeling, without a search for a reward, a result, is trueexperiment, isn’t it? In real experiencing, real experimenting, there cannot bethe search for result, because this experimenting is the movement of creativethought. To experiment, mind must be continually freeing itself from theenvironment with which it conflicts in its movement, the environment which wecall the past. There can be no creative thinking if mind is hindered by thesearch for a reward, by the pursuit of a goal.When the mind and heart are seeking a result or a gain, thereby complacency andstagnation, there must be practice, an overcoming, a discipline, out of whichcomes conflict. Most people think that by practicing a certain idea they willrelease creative thinking. Now, practice, if you come to observe it, ponder overit, is nothing but the result of duality. And an action born of this dualitymust perpetuate that distinction between mind and heart, and such action becomesmerely the expression of a calculated, logical, self-protective conclusion. Ifthere is this practice of self-discipline, or this continual domination orinfluence by circumstances, then practice is merely an alteration, a changetoward an end; it is merely action within the confines of the limited thoughtwhich you call self-consciousness. So practice does not bring about creativethinking.To think creatively is to bring about harmony between mind, emotion, and action.That is, if you are convinced of an action, without the search of a reward atthe end, then that action, being the result of intelligence, releases allhindrances that have been placed on the mind through the lack of understanding.Where the mind and heart are held by fear, by lack of understanding, bycompulsion, such a mind, though it can think within the confines, within thelimitations of that fear, is not really thinking, and its action must ever throwup new barriers. Therefore, its capacity to think is ever being limited. But ifthe mind frees itself through the understanding of circumstances and, therefore,acts, then that very action is creative thinking.QUESTIONER: Will you please give an example of the practical exercise ofconstant awareness and choice in everyday life?KRISHNAMURTI: Would you ask that question if there were a poisonous snake inyour room? Then you wouldn’t ask, “How am I to keep awake? How am I to beintensely aware?” You ask that question only when you are not sure that there isa poisonous snake in your room. Either you are wholly unconscious of it, or youwant to play with that snake, you want to enjoy its pain and its delights.Please follow this. There cannot be awareness, that alertness of mind andemotion, so long as mind is still caught up in both pain and pleasure. That is,when an experience gives you pain and at the same time gives you pleasure, youdo nothing about it. You act only when the pain is greater than the pleasure,but if the pleasure is greater, you do nothing at all about it, because there isno acute conflict. It is only when pain overbalances pleasure, is more acutethan pleasure, that you demand an action.Most people wait for the increase of pain before they act, and during thiswaiting period they want to know how to be aware. No one can tell them. They arewaiting for the increase of pain before they act; that is, they wait for painthrough its compulsion to force them to act, and in that compulsion there is nointelligence. It is merely environment which forces them to act in a particularway, not intelligence. Therefore when a mind is caught up in this stagnation, inthis lack of tenseness, there will naturally be more pain, more conflict.By the look of things political, war may break out again. It may break out intwo years, in five years, in ten years. An intelligent man can see this andintelligently act. But the man who is stagnating, who is waiting for pain toforce him to action, looks to greater chaos, greater suffering to give himimpetus to act and hence, his intelligence is not functioning. There isawareness only when the mind and heart are taut, are in great tenseness.For example, when you see that possessiveness must lead to incompleteness, whenyou see that insufficiency, lack of richness, shallowness, must ever producedependence, when you recognize that, what happens to your mind and heart? Theimmediate craving is to fill that shallowness; but apart from that, when you seethe futility of continual accumulation, you begin to be aware of how your mindis functioning. You see that in mere accumulation there cannot be creativethinking; and yet mind is pursuing accumulation. Therefore, in becoming aware ofthat, you create a conflict, and that very conflict will dissolve the cause ofaccumulation.Q: In what way could a statesman who understood what you are saying give itexpression in public affairs? Or is it not more likely that he would retire frompolitics when he understood their false bases and objectives?K: If he understood what I am saying, he would not separate politics from lifein its completeness; and I don’t see why he should retire. After all, politicsnow are merely instruments of exploitation; but if he considered life as awhole, not politics only—and by politics he means only his country, his people,and the exploitation of others—and regarded human problems not as national butas world problems, not as American, Hindu, or German problems, then, if heunderstood what I am talking about, he would be a true human being, not apolitician. And to me, that is the most important thing, to be a human being,not an exploiter, or merely an expert in one particular line. I think that iswhere the mischief lies. The politician deals with politics only; the moralistwith morals, the so-called spiritual teacher with the spirit, each thinking thathe is the expert, and excluding all others. Our whole structure of society isbased on that, and so these leaders of the various departments create greaterhavoc and greater misery, whereas if we as human beings saw the intimateconnection between all these, between politics, religion, economics, and sociallife, if we saw the connection, then we would not think and act separatively,individualistically.In India, for example, there are millions starving. The Hindu who is anationalist says, “Let us first become intensely national; then we shall be ableto solve this problem of starvation,” whereas to me, the way to solve theproblem of starvation is not to become nationalistic, but the contrary;starvation is a world problem, and this process of isolation but furtherincreases starvation. So if the politician deals with the problems of human lifemerely as a politician, then such a man creates greater havoc, greater mischief;but if he considers the whole of life without differentiation between races,nationalities, and classes, then he is truly a human being, though he may be apolitician.Q: You have said that with two or three others who understand, you could changethe world. Many believe that they themselves understand, and that there areothers likewise, such as artists and men of science, and yet the world is notchanged. Please speak of the way in which you would change the world. Are younot now changing the world, perhaps slowly and subtly, but neverthelessdefinitely, through your speaking, your living, and the influence you willundoubtedly have on human thought in the years to come? Is this the change youhad in mind, or was it something immediately affecting the political, economic,and racial structure?K: I am afraid I have never thought of the immediacy of action and its effect.To have a lasting, true result, there must be behind action great observation,thought, and intelligence, and very few people are willing to think creatively,or be free from influence and bias. If you begin to think individually, you willthen be able to cooperate intelligently; and as long as there is no intelligencethere cannot be cooperation, but only compulsion and hence, chaos.Q: To what extent can a person control his own actions? If we are, at any onetime, the sum of our previous experience, and there is no spiritual self, is itpossible for a person to act in any other way than that which is determined byhis original inheritance, the sum of his past training, and the stimuli whichplay upon him at the time? If so, what causes the changes in the physicalprocesses, and how?K: “To what extent can a person control his own actions?” A person does notcontrol his own actions if he has not understood environment. Then he is onlyacting under the compulsion, the influence, of environment; such an action isnot action at all, but is merely reaction or self-protectiveness. But when aperson begins to understand environment, sees its full significance and worth,then he is master of his own actions, then he is intelligent; and therefore, nomatter what the condition he will function intelligently.“If we are, at any one time, the sum of our previous experience, and there is nospiritual self, is it possible for a person to act in any other way than thatwhich is determined by his original inheritance, the sum of his past training,and the stimuli which play upon him at the time?”Again, what I have said applies to this. That is, if he is merely acting fromthe burden of the past, whether it be his individual or racial inheritance, suchaction is merely the reaction of fear; but if he understands the subconscious,that is, his past accumulations, then he is free of the past and, therefore, heis free of the compulsion of the environment.After all, environment is of the present as well as of the past. One does notunderstand the present because of the clouding of the mind by the past; and tofree the mind from the subconscious, the unconscious hindrances of the past, isnot to roll memory back into the past, but to be fully conscious in the present.In that consciousness, in that full consciousness of the present, all the pasthindrances come into activity, surge forward, and in that surging forward, ifyou are aware, you will see the full significance of the past and, therefore,understand the present.“If so, what causes the changes in the physical processes, and how?” As far as Iunderstand the questioner, he wants to know what produces this action, thisaction which is forced upon him by environment. He acts in a particular manner,compelled by environment, but if he understood environment intelligently, therewould be no compulsion whatever; there would be understanding, which is actionitself.Q: I live in a world of chaos, politically, economically, and socially, bound bylaws and conventions which restrict my freedom. When my desires conflict withthese impositions, I must break the law and take the consequences, or repress mydesires. Where then, in such a world, is there any escape from self-discipline?K: Self-discipline is merely an adjustment to environment, brought about throughconflict. That is what I call self-discipline. You have established a pattern,an ideal, which acts as a compulsion, and you are forcing the mind to adjustitself to that environment, forcing it, modifying it, controlling it. Whathappens when you do that? You are really destroying creativeness; you areperverting, suppressing, creative affection. But if you begin to understandenvironment, then there is no longer repression or mere adjustment toenvironment, which you call self-discipline.How then can you understand environment? How can you understand its full worth,significance? What prevents you from seeing its significance? First of all,fear. Fear is the cause of the search for protection or security, security whichis either physical, spiritual, religious, or emotional. So long as there is thatsearch there must be fear, which then creates a barrier between your mind andyour environment, and thereby creates conflict; and that conflict you cannotdissolve as long as you are only concerned with adjustment, modification, andnever with the discovery of the fundamental cause of fear.So where there is this search for security, for a certainty, for a goal,preventing creative thinking, there must be adjustment, called self-discipline,which is but compulsion, the imitation of a pattern, whereas when the mind seesthat there is no such thing as security in the piling up of things or ofknowledge, then mind is released from fear and, therefore, mind is intelligence,and that which is intelligence does not discipline itself. There isself-discipline only where there is no intelligence. Where there isintelligence, there is understanding, free from influence, from control anddomination.Q: How is it possible to awaken thought in an organism wherein the mechanismrequisite for the apprehension of abstract ideas is absent?K: By the simple process of suffering; by the process of continual experience.But you see, we have taken such shelter behind false values that we have ceasedto think at all, and then we ask, “What are we to do? How are we to awakenthought?” We have cultivated fears which have become glorified as virtues andideals, behind which mind takes shelter, and all action proceeds from thatshelter, from that mold. Therefore, there is no thinking. You have conventions,and the adjusting of oneself to these conventions is called thought and action,which is not at all thought or action, because it is born of fear and,therefore, cripples the mind.How can you awaken thought? Circumstances, or the death of someone you love, ora catastrophe, or depression, force you into conflict. Outer circumstances forceyou to act, and in that compulsion there cannot be the awakening of thought,because you are acting through fear. And if you begin to see that you cannotwait for circumstances to force you to act, then you begin to observe the verycircumstances themselves; then you begin to penetrate and understand thecircumstances, the environment. You don’t wait for depression to make you into avirtuous person, but you free your mind from possessiveness, from compulsion.The acquisitive system is based on the idea that you can possess, and that it islegal to possess. Possession glorifies you. The more you have, the better, thenobler, you are considered. You have created that system, and you have become aslave to that system. You can create another society, not based onacquisitiveness, and that society can compel you as individuals to conform toits conventions, just as this society compels you to conform to itsacquisitiveness. What is the difference? None whatever. You as individuals aremerely being forced by circumstances or law to act in a particular directionand, therefore, there is no creative thinking at all; whereas if intelligence isbeginning to function, then you are not a slave to either society, theacquisitive or the nonacquisitive. But to free the mind, there must be greatintensity; there must be this continual alertness, observation, which itselfcreates conflict. This alertness itself produces a disturbance, and when thereis that crisis, that intensity of conflict, then mind, if it is not escaping,begins to think anew, to think creatively, and that very thinking is eternity.Ojai, California, June 30, 1934"},{"pageContent":"BEING VULNERABLE TO TRUTH [index_split_001.html#filepos2594] I think most people have lost the art of listening. They come with theirparticular problems, and think that by listening to my talk their problems willbe solved. I am afraid this will not happen; but if you know how to listen, thenyou will begin to understand the whole, and your mind will not be entangled bythe particular.So, if I may suggest it, don’t try to seek from this talk a solution for yourparticular problem, or an alleviation of your suffering. I can help you orrather, you will help yourself only if you think anew, creatively. Regard lifenot as several isolated problems, but comprehensively, as a whole, with a mindthat is not suffocated by the search for solutions. If you will listen withoutthe burden of problems, and take a comprehensive outlook, then you will see thatyour particular problem has a different significance; and although it may not besolved at once, you will begin to see the true cause of it. In thinking anew, inrelearning how to think, there will come the dissolution of the problems andconflicts with which one’s mind and heart are burdened, and from which arise alldisharmony, pain, and suffering.Now, each one, more or less, is consumed by desires whose objects vary accordingto environment, temperament, and inheritance. According to your particularcondition, to your particular education and upbringing, religious, social, andeconomic, you have established certain objectives whose attainment you areceaselessly pursuing, and this pursuit has become paramount in your lives.Once you have established these objectives, there naturally arise thespecialists who act as your guides toward the attainment of your desires. Hence,the perfection of technique, specialization, becomes merely the means to gainyour end; and in order to gain this end, which you have established through yourreligious, economic, and social conditioning, you must have specialists. So youraction loses its significance, its value, because you are concerned with theattainment of an objective, not with the fulfillment of intelligence which isaction; you are concerned with the arrival, not with that which is fulfillmentitself. Living becomes merely the means to an end, and life a school in whichyou learn to attain an end. Action, therefore, becomes but a medium throughwhich you can come to that objective which you have established through yourvarious environments and conditions. So life becomes a school of great conflictand struggle, never a thing of fulfillment, of richness, of completeness.Then you begin to ask, what is the end, the purpose of living? This is what mostpeople ask; this is what is in the minds of most people here. Why are we living?What is the end? What is the goal? What is the purpose? You are concerned withthe purpose, with the end, rather than with living in the present; whereas a manwho fulfills never inquires into the end because fulfillment itself issufficient. But as you do not know how to fulfill, how to live completely,richly, sufficiently, you begin to inquire into the purpose, the goal, the end,because you think you can then meet life, knowing the end—at least you think youcan know the end—then, knowing the end, you hope to use experience as a meanstoward that end; hence, life becomes a medium, a measure, a value to come tothat attainment.Consciously or unconsciously, surreptitiously or openly, one begins to inquireinto the purpose of life, and each one receives an answer from the so-calledspecialists. The artist, if you ask him what is the purpose of life, will tellyou that it is self-expression through painting, sculpture, music, or poetry;the economist, if you ask him, will tell you that it is work, production,cooperation, living together, functioning as a group, as society; and if you askthe religionist he will tell you the purpose of life is to seek and to realizeGod, to live according to the laws laid down by teachers, prophets, saviors, andthat by living according to their laws and edicts you may realize that truthwhich is God. Each specialist gives you his answer about the purpose of life,and according to your temperament, fancies, and imagination you begin toestablish these purposes, these ends, as your ideals.Such ideals and ends have become merely a haven of refuge because you use themto guide and protect yourself in this turmoil. So you begin to use these idealsto measure your experiences, to inquire into the conditions of your environment.You begin, without the desire to understand or to fulfill, merely to inquireinto the purpose of environment; and in discovering that purpose, according toyour conditioning, your preconceptions, you merely avoid the conflict of livingwithout understanding.So mind has divided life into ideals, purposes, culminations, attainments, ends;and turmoil, conflict, disturbance, disharmony; and you, yourself, theself-consciousness. That is, mind has separated life into these three divisions.You are caught up in turmoil and so through this turmoil, this conflict, thisdisturbance which is but sorrow, you work toward an end, a purpose. You wadethrough, plough through this turmoil to the goal, to the end, to the haven ofrefuge, to the attainment of the ideal; and these ideals, ends, refuges havebeen designed by economic, religious, and spiritual experts.Thus, you are, at one end, wading through conditions and environment, andcreating conflict while trying to realize ideals, purposes, and attainmentswhich have become refuges and shelters at the other. The very inquiry into thepurpose of life indicates the lack of intelligence in the present; and the manwho is fully active—not lost in activities, as most Americans are, but fullyactive, intelligently, emotionally, fully alive—has fulfilled himself.Therefore, the inquiry into an end is futile, because there is no such thing asan end and a beginning; there is but the continual movement of creativethinking, and what you call problems are the results of your ploughing throughthis turmoil toward a culmination. That is, you are concerned with how toovercome this turmoil, how to adjust yourselves to environment in order toarrive at an end. With that your whole life is concerned, not with yourself andthe goal. You are not concerned with that, you are concerned with the turmoil,how to go through it, how to dominate it, how to overcome it and, therefore, howto evade it. You want to arrive at that perfect evasion which you call ideals,at that perfect refuge which you call the purpose of life, which is but anescape from the present turmoil.Naturally, when you seek to overcome, to dominate, to evade, and to arrive atthat ultimate goal, there arises the search for systems and their leaders,guides, teachers, and experts; to me all these are exploiters. The systems, themethods, and their teachers, and all the complications of their rivalries,enticements, promises, and deceits, create divisions in life known as sects andcults.That is what is happening. When you are seeking an attainment, a result, anovercoming of the turmoil, and not considering the “you,” the “I” consciousness,and the end which you are ceaselessly and consciously, or unconsciously,pursuing, naturally you must create exploiters, either of the past or thepresent; and you are caught up in their pettinesses, their jealousies, theirdisciplines, their disharmonies, and their divisions. So the mere desire to gothrough this turmoil ever creates further problems, for there is noconsideration of the actor or the manner of his action, but merely theconsideration of the scene of turmoil as a means to get to an end.Now to me, the turmoil, the end, and the “you” are the same; there is nodivision. This division is artificial, and it is created by the desire to gain,by the pursuit of acquisitive accumulation, which is born of insufficiency.In becoming conscious of emptiness, of shallowness, one begins to realize theutter insufficiency of one’s own thinking and feeling, and so in one’s thoughtthere arises the idea of accumulation, and from that is born this divisionbetween “you,” the self-consciousness, and the end. To me, as I said, there canbe no such distinction, because the moment you fulfill there can no longer bethe actor and the act, but only that creative movement of thought which does notseek a result, and so there is a continual living, which is immortality.But you have divided life. Let us consider what this “I,” this actor, thisobserver, this center of conflict, is. It is but a long, continuous scroll ofmemory. This “I” is a scroll of memory in which there are accentuations. Theseaccentuations or depressions we call complexes, and from these we act. That is,mind, being conscious of insufficiency, pursues a gain and, therefore, creates adistinction, a division. Such a mind cannot understand environment, and as itcannot understand it, it must rely on the accumulation of memory for guidance;for memory is but a series of accumulations which act as a guide toward an end.That is the purpose of memory. Memory is the lack of comprehension; that lack ofcomprehension is your background, and from that proceeds your action.This memory is acting as a guide toward an end, and that end, beingpreestablished, is merely a self-protective refuge which you call ideals,attainment, truth, God, or perfection. The beginning and the end, the “you” andthe goal, are the results of this self-protective mind.I have explained how a self-protective mind comes into being; it comes intobeing as the result of the consciousness or awareness of emptiness, of void.Therefore, it begins to think in terms of achievement, acquisition, and fromthat it begins to function, dividing life and restricting its actions. So theend and the “you” are the result of this self-protective mind; and turmoil,conflict, and disharmony are but the process of self-protection, and are bornout of this self-protection, spiritual and economic.Spiritually and economically you are seeking security, because you rely onaccumulation for your richness, for your comprehension, for your fullness, foryour fulfillment. And so the cunning, in the spiritual as well as in theeconomic world, exploit you, for both seek power by glorifying self-protection.So each mind is making a tremendous effort to protect itself, and the end, themeans, and the “you” are nothing else but the process of self-protection. Whathappens when there is this process of self-protection? There must be conflictwith circumstances, which we call society; there is the “you” trying to protectitself against the collective, the group, the society.Now, the reverse of that isn’t true. That is, don’t think that if you cease toprotect yourself you will be lost. On the contrary, you will be lost if you areprotecting yourself due to the insufficiency, due to the shallowness of thoughtand affection. But if you merely cease to protect yourself because you thinkthrough that you are going to find truth, again it will be but another form ofprotection.So, as we have built up through centuries, generation after generation, thiswheel of self-protection, spiritual and economic, let us find out if spiritualor economic self-protection is real. Perhaps economically you may assertself-protection for a while. The man who has money and many possessions, and whohas secured comforts and pleasures for his body, is generally, if you willobserve, most insufficient and unintelligent, and is groping after so-calledspiritual protection.Let us inquire however if there really is spiritual self-protection, becauseeconomically we see there is no security. The illusion of economic security isshown throughout the world by these depressions, crises, wars, calamities, andchaos. We recognize this, and so turn to spiritual security. But to me there isno security, there is no self-protection, and there never can be any. I saythere is only wisdom, which is understanding, not protection. That is, security,self-protection, is the outcome of insufficiency, in which there is nointelligence, in which there is no creative thinking, in which there is constantbattle between the “you” and society, and in which the cunning exploit youruthlessly. As long as there is the pursuit of self-protection there must beconflict, and so there can be no understanding, no wisdom. And as long as thisattitude exists, your search for spirituality, for truth, or for God is vain,useless, because it is merely the search for greater power, greater security.It is only when the mind, which has taken shelter behind the walls ofself-protection, frees itself from its own creations that there can be thatexquisite reality. After all, these walls of self-protection are the creationsof the mind which, conscious of its insufficiency, builds these walls ofprotection, and behind them takes shelter. One has built up these barriersunconsciously or consciously, and one’s mind is so crippled, bound, held, thataction brings greater conflict, further disturbances.So the mere search for the solution of your problems is not going to free themind from creating further problems. As long as this center ofself-protectiveness, born of insufficiency, exists, there must be disturbances,tremendous sorrow, and pain; and you cannot free the mind of sorrow bydisciplining it not to be insufficient. That is, you cannot discipline yourself,or be influenced by conditions and environment, in order not to be shallow. Yousay to yourself, “I am shallow; I recognize the fact, and how am I going to getrid of it?” I say, do not seek to get rid of it, which is merely a process ofsubstitution, but become conscious, become aware of what is causing thisinsufficiency. You cannot compel it; you cannot force it; it cannot beinfluenced by an ideal, by a fear, by the pursuit of enjoyment and powers. Youcan find out the cause of insufficiency only through awareness. That is, bylooking into environment and piercing into its significance there will berevealed the cunning subtleties of self-protection.After all, self-protection is the result of insufficiency, and as the mind hasbeen trained, caught up in its bondage for centuries, you cannot discipline it,you cannot overcome it. If you do, you lose the significance of the deceits andsubtleties of thought and emotion behind which mind has taken shelter; and todiscover these subtleties you must become conscious, aware.Now to be aware is not to alter. Our mind is accustomed to alteration which ismerely modification, adjustment, becoming disciplined to a condition; whereas ifyou are aware, you will discover the full significance of the environment.Therefore there is no modification, but entire freedom from that environment.Only when all these walls of protection are destroyed in the flame of awareness,in which there is no modification or alteration or adjustment, but completeunderstanding of the significance of environment with all its delicacies andsubtleties—only through that understanding is there the eternal; because in thatthere is no “you” functioning as a self-protective focus. But as long as thatself-protecting focus which you call the “I” exists, there must be confusion,there must be disturbance, disharmony, and conflict. You cannot destroy thesehindrances by disciplining yourself or by following a system or by imitating apattern; you can understand them with all their complications only through thefull awareness of mind and heart. Then there is an ecstasy, there is that livingmovement of truth, which is not an end, not a culmination, but an ever-creativeliving, an ecstasy which cannot be described, because all description mustdestroy it. So long as you are not vulnerable to truth, there is no ecstasy,there is no immortality.Ojai, California, July 1, 1934"},{"pageContent":"PART 2INSIGHTS INTO EVERYDAY LIFE [index_split_001.html#filepos2738] People have often wondered how Krishnamurti, whom they believe lived inprotected and luxurious circumstances, could have had the remarkable insightsinto the often trouble-fraught lives of ordinary people that he demonstrated inhis writings and talks. Without knowing of the illnesses of his childhood, hissuffering at the time of his brother’s death, or his lifelong physical pain andsensitivity, they have marveled at his ability to see through the eyes of amother living in poverty in an Indian village, of a laborer toiling on a dustyroad, of a rich man or a troubled young student.During the 1930s and ‘40s, Krishnamurti gave private interviews to people fromalmost every social background who asked to speak with him about their personalproblems. Perceiving the unity of human existence, he was able to conveyrevealing insights into issues affecting all men and women. He described theessence of these probing discussions in books which also expressed his deepappreciation of the natural landscape and his intense, long-standing concern forthe environment.This part presents some of these writings, which have been published in threevolumes as The Commentaries on Living. Here, too, are extracts from his writingson education and to the young Education and the Significance of Life and LifeAhead) and on freedom, in a book with an introduction by Aldous Huxley, TheFirst and Last Freedom. Possibly some of the most intimate and revealingpassages are those selected from his Journal and from Krishnamurti to Himself inwhich (as in Krishnamurti’s Notebook) he often touches on the deepest mysticalsources of his lifetime of teaching."},{"pageContent":"THE FIRST AND LAST FREEDOM [index_split_001.html#filepos2912] To communicate with one another, even if we know each other very well, isextremely difficult. I may use words that may have to you a significancedifferent from mine. Understanding comes when we, you and I, meet on the samelevel at the same time. That happens only when there is real affection betweenpeople, between husband and wife, between intimate friends. That is realcommunion. Instantaneous understanding comes when we meet on the same level atthe same time.It is very difficult to commune with one another easily, effectively, and withdefinitive action. I am using words which are simple, which are not technical,because I do not think that any technical type of expression is going to help ussolve our difficult problems; so I am not going to use any technical terms,either of psychology or of science. I have not read any books on psychology orany religious books, fortunately. I would like to convey, by the very simplewords which we use in our daily life, a deeper significance; but that is verydifficult if you do not know how to listen.There is an art of listening. To be able really to listen, one should abandon orput aside all prejudices, preformulations, and daily activities. When you are ina receptive state of mind, things can be easily understood; you are listeningwhen your real attention is given to something. But unfortunately most of uslisten through a screen of resistance. We are screened with prejudices, whetherreligious or spiritual, psychological, or scientific; or with our daily worries,desires, and fears. And with these for a screen, we listen. Therefore, we listenreally to our own noise, to our own sound, not to what is being said. It isextremely difficult to put aside our training, our prejudices, our inclination,our resistance, and, reaching beyond the verbal expression, to listen so that weunderstand instantaneously. That is going to be one of our difficulties.If, during this discourse, anything is said which is opposed to your way ofthinking and belief, just listen; do not resist. You may be right and I may bewrong; but by listening and considering together we are going to find out whatis the truth. Truth cannot be given to you by somebody. You have to discover it;and to discover, there must be a state of mind in which there is directperception. There is no direct perception when there is a resistance, asafeguard, a protection. Understanding comes through being aware of what is. Toknow exactly what is. the real, the actual, without interpreting it, withoutcondemning or justifying it, is, surely, the beginning of wisdom. It is onlywhen we begin to interpret, to translate according to our conditioning,according to our prejudice, that we miss the truth. After all, it is likeresearch. To know what something is, what it is exactly, requires research—youcannot translate it according to your moods. Similarly, if we can look, observe,listen, be aware of, what is. exactly, then the problem is solved. And that iswhat we are going to do in all these discourses. I am going to point out to youwhat is. and not translate it according to my fancy; nor should you translate itor interpret it according to your background or training.Is it not possible, then, to be aware of everything as it is? Starting fromthere, surely, there can be an understanding. To acknowledge, to be aware of, toget at that which is, puts an end to struggle. If I know that I am a liar, andit is a fact which I recognize, then the struggle is over. To acknowledge, to beaware of what one is, is already the beginning of wisdom, the beginning ofunderstanding, which releases you from time. To bring in the quality oftime—time, not in the chronological sense, but as the medium, as thepsychological process, the process of the mind—is destructive, and createsconfusion.So, we can have understanding of what is when we recognize it withoutcondemnation, without justification, without identification. To know that one isin a certain condition, in a certain state, is already a process of liberation;but a man who is not aware of his condition, of his struggle, tries to besomething other than he is, which brings about habit. So, then, let us keep inmind that we want to examine what is, to observe and be aware of exactly what isthe actual, without giving it any slant, without giving it an interpretation. Ittakes an extraordinarily astute mind, an extraordinarily pliable heart, to beaware of and to follow what is: because what is is constantly moving, constantlyundergoing a transformation, and if the mind is tethered to belief, toknowledge, it ceases to pursue, it ceases to follow the swift movement of whatis. What is is not static, surely it is constantly moving, as you will see ifyou observe it very closely. To follow it, you need a very swift mind and apliable heart—which are denied when the mind is static, fixed in a belief, in aprejudice, in an identification; and a mind and heart that are dry cannot followeasily, swiftly, that which is.One is aware, I think, without too much discussion, too much verbal expression,that there is individual as well as collective chaos, confusion, and misery. Itis not only in India, but right throughout the world; in China, America,England, Germany, all over the world, there is confusion, mounting sorrow. It isnot only national, it is not particularly here, it is all over the world. Thereis extraordinarily acute suffering, and it is not individual only butcollective. So it is a world catastrophe, and to limit it merely to ageographical area, a colored section of the map, is absurd; because then weshall not understand the full significance of this worldwide as well asindividual suffering. Being aware of this confusion, what is our response today?How do we react?There is suffering—political, social, religious; our whole psychological beingis confused, and all the leaders, political and religious, have failed us; allthe books have lost their significance. You may go to the Bhagavad Gita or theBible or the latest treatise on politics or psychology, and you will find thatthey have lost that ring, that quality of truth; they have become mere words.You yourself, who are the repeater of those words, are confused and uncertain,and mere repetition of words conveys nothing. Therefore, the words and the bookshave lost their value; that is, if you quote the Bible, or Marx, or the BhagavadGita, as you who quote it are yourself uncertain, confused, your repetitionbecomes a lie; because what is written there becomes mere propaganda, andpropaganda is not truth. So when you repeat, you have ceased to understand yourown state of being. You are merely covering with words of authority your ownconfusion. But what we are trying to do is to understand this confusion and notcover it up with quotations; so what is your response to it? How do you respondto this extraordinary chaos, this confusion, this uncertainty of existence? Beaware of it, as I discuss it. Follow not my words, but the thought which isactive in you. Most of us are accustomed to being spectators and not to partakein the game. We read books but we never write books. It has become ourtradition, our national and universal habit, to be the spectators, to look on ata football game, to watch the public politicians and orators. We are merely theoutsiders, looking on, and we have lost the creative capacity. Therefore, wewant to absorb and partake.But if you are merely observing, if you are merely spectators, you will loseentirely the significance of this discourse, because I am not going to give youinformation which you can pick up in an encyclopedia. What we are trying to dois to follow each other’s thoughts, to pursue as far as we can, as profoundly aswe can, the intimations, the responses, of our own feelings. So please find outwhat your response is to this cause, to this suffering; not what somebody else’swords are, but how you yourself respond. Your response is one of indifference ifyou benefit by the suffering, by the chaos, if you derive profit from it, eithereconomic, social, political, or psychological. Therefore, you do not mind ifthis chaos continues. Surely, the more trouble there is in the world, the morechaos, the more one seeks security. Haven’t you noticed it? When there isconfusion in the world, psychologically and in every way, you enclose yourselfin some kind of security, either that of a bank account or that of an ideology;or else you turn to prayer, you go to the temple, which is really escaping fromwhat is happening in the world. More and more sects are being formed, more andmore “isms” are springing up all over the world. Because the more confusionthere is, the more you want a leader, somebody who will guide you out of thismess, so you turn to the religious books, or to one of the latest teachers; orelse you act and respond according to a system which appears to solve theproblem, a system either of the left or of the right. That is exactly what ishappening.The moment you are aware of confusion, of exactly what is, you try to escapefrom it. Those sects which offer you a system for the solution ofsuffering—economic, social, or religious—are the worst; because then systembecomes important and not man—whether it be a religious system, or a system ofthe left or of the right. System becomes important—the philosophy, the idea,becomes important—and not man; and for the sake of the idea, of the ideology,you are willing to sacrifice all mankind, which is exactly what is happening inthe world. This is not merely my interpretation; if you observe, you will findthat is exactly what is happening. The system has become important. Therefore,as the system has become important, men, you and I, lose significance; and thecontrollers of the system, whether religious or social, whether of the left orof the right, assume authority, assume power and, therefore, sacrifice you, theindividual. That is exactly what is happening.Now what is the cause of this confusion, this misery? How did this misery comeabout, this suffering, not only inwardly but outwardly, this fear andexpectation of war, the third World War that is breaking out? What is the causeof it? Surely it indicates the collapse of all moral, spiritual, values, and theglorification of all sensual values, of the value of things made by the hand orby the mind. What happens when we have no other values except the value of thethings of the senses, the value of the products of the mind, of the hand, or ofthe machine? The more significance we give to the sensual value of things, thegreater the confusion, is it not? Again, this is not my theory. You do not haveto quote books to find out that your values, your riches, your economic andsocial existence are based on things made by the hand or by the mind. So we liveand function and have our being steeped in sensual values, which means thatthings, the things of the mind, the things of the hand and of the machine, havebecome important; and when things become important, belief becomes predominantlysignificant—which is exactly what is happening in the world, is it not?Thus, giving more and more significance to the values of the senses brings aboutconfusion; and, being in confusion, we try to escape from it through variousforms, whether religious, economic or social, or through ambition, throughpower, through the search for reality. But the real is near, you do not have toseek it; and a man who seeks truth will never find it. Truth is in what is—andthat is the beauty of it. But the moment you conceive it, the moment you seekit, you begin to struggle; and a man who struggles cannot understand. That iswhy we have to be still, observant, passively aware. We see that our living, ouraction, is always within the field of destruction, within the field of sorrow;like a wave, confusion and chaos always overtake us. There is no interval in theconfusion of existence.Whatever we do at present seems to lead to chaos, seems to lead to sorrow andunhappiness. Look at your own life and you will see that our living is always onthe border of sorrow. Our work, our social activity, our politics, the variousgatherings of nations to stop war, all produce further war. Destruction followsin the wake of living; whatever we do leads to death. That is what is actuallytaking place.Can we stop this misery at once, and not go on always being caught by the waveof confusion and sorrow? That is, great teachers, whether the Buddha or theChrist, have come; they have accepted faith, making themselves, perhaps, freefrom confusion and sorrow. But they have never prevented sorrow, they have neverstopped confusion. Confusion goes on, sorrow goes on. If you, seeing this socialand economic confusion, this chaos, this misery, withdraw into what is calledthe religious life and abandon the world, you may feel that you are joiningthese great teachers; but the world goes on with its chaos, its misery anddestruction, the everlasting suffering of its rich and poor. So, our problem,yours and mine, is whether we can step out of this misery instantaneously. If,living in the world, you refuse to be a part of it, you will help others out ofthis chaos—not in the future, not tomorrow, but now. Surely that is our problem.War is probably coming, more destructive, more appalling in its form. Surely wecannot prevent it, because the issues are much too strong and too close. But youand I can perceive the confusion and misery immediately, can we not? We mustperceive them, and then we shall be in a position to awaken the sameunderstanding of truth in another. In other words, can you be instantaneouslyfree? Because that is the only way out of this misery. Perception can take placeonly in the present; but if you say, “I will do it tomorrow,” the wave ofconfusion overtakes you, and you are then always involved in confusion.Now is it possible to come to that state when you yourself perceive the truthinstantaneously and, therefore, put an end to confusion? I say that it is, andthat it is the only possible way. I say it can be done and must be done, notbased on supposition or belief. To bring about this extraordinaryrevolution—which is not the revolution to get rid of the capitalists and installanother group—to bring about this wonderful transformation, which is the onlytrue revolution, is the problem. What is generally called revolution is merelythe modification or the continuance of the right according to the ideas of theleft. The left, after all, is the continuation of the right in a modified form.If the right is based on sensual values, the left is but a continuance of thesame sensual values, different only in degree or expression. Therefore, truerevolution can take place only when you, the individual, become aware in yourrelationship to another. Surely what you are in your relationship to another, toyour wife, your child, your boss, your neighbor, is society. Society by itselfis nonexistent. Society is what you and I, in our relationship, have created; itis the outward projection of all our own inward psychological states. So if youand I do not understand ourselves, merely transforming the outer, which is theprojection of the inner, has no significance whatsoever; that is, there can beno significant alteration or modification in society so long as I do notunderstand myself in relationship to you. Being confused in my relationship, Icreate a society which is the replica, the outward expression, of what I am.This is an obvious fact, which we can discuss. We can discuss whether society,the outward expression, has produced me, or whether I have produced society.Is it not, therefore, an obvious fact that what I am in my relationship toanother creates society, and that without radically transforming myself, therecan be no transformation of the essential function of society? When we look to asystem for the transformation of society, we are merely evading the question,because a system cannot transform man; man always transforms the system, whichhistory shows. Until I, in my relationship to you, understand myself, I am thecause of chaos, misery, destruction, fear, brutality. Understanding myself isnot a matter of time; I can understand myself at this very moment. If I say, “Ishall understand myself tomorrow,” I am bringing in chaos and misery, my actionis destructive. The moment I say that I “shall” understand, I bring in the timeelement and so am already caught up in the wave of confusion and destruction.Understanding is now, not tomorrow. Tomorrow is for the lazy mind, the sluggishmind, the mind that is not interested. When you are interested in something, youdo it instantaneously, there is immediate understanding, immediatetransformation. If you do not change now, you will never change, because thechange that takes place tomorrow is merely a modification, it is nottransformation. Transformation can only take place immediately; the revolutionis now, not tomorrow.When that happens, you are completely without a problem, for then the self isnot worried about itself; then you are beyond the wave of destruction."},{"pageContent":"AMBITION [index_split_001.html#filepos3068] The baby had been crying all night, and the poor mother had been doing her bestto quiet him. She sang to him, she scolded him, she petted and rocked him; butit was no good. The baby must have been teething, and it was a weary night forthe whole family. But now the dawn was coming over the dark trees, and at lastthe baby became quiet. There was a peculiar stillness as the sky grew lighterand lighter. The deep branches were clear against the sky, slender and naked; achild called, a dog barked, a lorry rattled by, and another day had begun.Presently the mother came out carrying the baby, carefully wrapped, and walkedalong the road past the village, where she waited for a bus. Presumably she wastaking him to the doctor. She looked so tired and haggard after that sleeplessnight, but the baby was fast asleep.Soon the sun was over the treetops, and the dew sparkled on the green grass. Faraway a train whistled, and the distant mountains looked cool and shadowy. Alarge bird flew noisily away, for we had disturbed her brooding. Our approachmust have been very sudden, for she hadn’t had time to cover her eggs with dryleaves. There were over a dozen of them. Even though uncovered they were hardlyvisible, she had so cleverly concealed them, and now she was watching from adistant tree. We saw the mother with her brood a few days later, and the nestwas empty.It was shady and cool along the path, which led through the damp woods to thedistant hilltop, and the wattle was in bloom. It had rained heavily a few daysbefore, and the earth was soft and yielding. There were fields of youngpotatoes, and far down in the valley was the town. It was a beautiful, goldenmorning. Beyond the hill the path led back, to the house.She was very clever. She had read all the latest books, had seen the latestplays, and was well-informed about some philosophy which had become the latestcraze. She had been analyzed and had apparently read a great deal of psychology,for she knew the jargon. She made a point of seeing all the important people,and had casually met someone who brought her along. She talked easily andexpressed herself with poise and effect. She had been married, but had had nochildren; and one felt that all that was behind her, and that now she was on adifferent journey. She must have been rich, for she had about her that peculiaratmosphere of the wealthy. She began right away by asking, “In what way are youhelping the world in this present crisis?” It must have been one of her stockquestions. She went on to ask, more eagerly, about the prevention of war, theeffects of communism, and the future of man.Are not wars, the increasing disasters and miseries, the outcome of our dailylife? Are we not, each one of us, responsible for this crisis? The future is inthe present; the future will not be very different if there is no comprehensionof the present. But do you not think that each one of us is responsible for thisconflict and confusion?“It may be so; but where does this recognition of responsibility lead? Whatvalue has my little action in the vast destructive action? In what way is mythought going to affect the general stupidity of man? What is happening in theworld is sheer stupidity, and my intelligence is in no way going to affect it.Besides, think of the time it would take for individual action to make anyimpression on the world.”Is the world different from you? Has not the structure of society been built upby people like you and me? To bring about a radical change in the structure,must not you and I fundamentally transform ourselves? How can there be a deeprevolution of values if it does not begin with us? To help in the presentcrisis, must one look for a new ideology, a new economic plan? Or must one beginto understand the conflict and confusion within oneself, which, in itsprojection, is the world? Can new ideologies bring unity between man and man? Donot beliefs set man against man? Must we not put away our ideologicalbarriers—for all barriers are ideological—and consider our problems, not throughthe bias of conclusion and formulas, but directly and without prejudice? We arenever directly in relationship with our problems, but always through some beliefor formulation. We can solve our problems only when we are directly inrelationship with them. It is not our problems which set man against man, butour ideas about them. Problems bring us together, but ideas separate us. If onemay ask, why are you so apparently concerned about the crisis?“Oh, I don’t know. I see so much suffering, so much misery, and I feel somethingmust be done about it.”Are you really concerned, or are you merely ambitious to do something?“When you put it that way, I suppose I am ambitious to do something in which Ishall succeed.”So few of us are honest in our thinking. We want to be successful, eitherdirectly for ourselves, or for the ideal, the belief with which we haveidentified ourselves. The ideal is our own projection, it is the product of ourmind, and our mind experiences according to our conditioning. For theseself-projections we work, we slave away and die. Nationalism, like the worshipof God, is only the glorification of oneself. It is oneself that is important,actually or ideologically, and not the disaster and the misery. We really do notwant to do anything about the crisis; it is merely a new topic for the clever, afield for the socially active and for the idealist.Why are we ambitious?“If we were not, nothing would get done in the world. If we were not ambitiouswe would still be driving about in horse carriages. Ambition is another name forprogress. Without progress, we would decay, wither away.”In getting things done in the world, we are also breeding wars and untoldmiseries. Is ambition progress? For the moment we are not considering progress,but ambition. Why are we ambitious? Why do we want to succeed, to be somebody?Why do we struggle to be superior? Why all this effort to assert oneself,whether directly, or through an ideology or the State? Is not thisself-assertion the main cause of our conflict and confusion? Without ambition,would we perish? Can we not physically survive without being ambitious?“Who wants to survive without success, without recognition?”Does not this desire for success, for applause, bring conflict both within andwithout? Would being free of ambition mean decay? Is it stagnation to have noconflict? We can drug ourselves, put ourselves to sleep with beliefs, withdoctrines, and so have no deep conflicts. For most of us, some kind of activityis the drug. Obviously, such a state is one of decay, disintegration. But whenwe are aware of the false as the false, does it bring death? To be aware thatambition in any form, whether for happiness, for God, or for success, is thebeginning of conflict both within and without, surely does not mean the end ofall action, the end of life.Why are we ambitious?“I would be bored if I were not occupied in striving to achieve some kind ofresult. I used to be ambitious for my husband, and I suppose you would say itwas for myself through my husband; and now I am ambitious for myself through anidea. I have never thought about ambition, I have just been ambitious.”Why are we clever and ambitious? Is not ambition an urge to avoid what is? Isnot this cleverness really stupid, which is what we are? Why are we sofrightened of what is? What is the good of running away if whatever we are isalways there? We may succeed in escaping, but what we are is still there,breeding conflict and misery. Why are we so frightened of our loneliness, of ouremptiness? Any activity away from what is is bound to bring sorrow andantagonism. Conflict is the denial of what is or the running away from what is;there is no conflict other than that. Our conflict becomes more and more complexand insoluble because we do not face what is. There is no complexity in what is,but only in the many escapes that we seek."},{"pageContent":"THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE IDEAL [index_split_001.html#filepos3206] “Our life here in India is more or less shattered; we want to make something ofit again, but we don’t know where to begin. I can see the importance of massaction, and also its dangers. I have pursued the ideal of nonviolence, but therehas been bloodshed and misery. Since the Partition, this country has had bloodon its hands, and now we are building up the armed forces. We talk ofnonviolence and yet prepare for war. I am as confused as the political leaders.In prison I used to read a great deal, but it has not helped me to clarify myown position.“Can we take one thing at a time and somewhat go into it? First, you lay a greatdeal of emphasis on the individual, but is not collective action necessary?”The individual is essentially the collective, and society is the creation of theindividual. The individual and society are interrelated, are they not? They arenot separate. The individual builds the structure of society, and society orenvironment shapes the individual. Though environment conditions the individual,he can always free himself, break away from his background. The individual isthe maker of the very environment to which he becomes a slave; but he has alsothe power to break away from it and create an environment that will not dull hismind or spirit. The individual is important only in the sense that he has thecapacity to free himself from his conditioning and understand reality.Individuality that is merely ruthless in its own conditioning builds a societywhose foundations are based on violence and antagonism. The individual existsonly in relationship, otherwise he is not; and it is the lack of understandingof this relationship that is breeding conflict and confusion. If the individualdoes not understand his relationship to people, to property, and to ideas orbeliefs, merely to impose upon him a collective or any other pattern onlydefeats its own end. To bring about the imposition of a new pattern will requireso-called mass action; but the new pattern is the invention of a fewindividuals, and the mass is mesmerized by the latest slogans, the promises of anew utopia. The mass is the same as before, only now it has new rulers, newphrases, new priests, new doctrines. This mass is made up of you and me, it iscomposed of individuals; the mass is fictitious, it is a convenient term for theexploiter and the politician to play with. The many are pushed into action, intowar, and so on, by the few; and the few represent the desires and urges of themany. It is the transformation of the individual that is of the highestimportance, but not in terms of any pattern. Patterns always condition, and aconditioned entity is always in conflict within himself and so with society. Itis comparatively easy to substitute a new pattern of conditioning for the old;but for the individual to free himself from all conditioning is quite anothermatter.“This requires careful and detailed thought, but I think I am beginning tounderstand it. You lay emphasis on the individual, but not as a separate andantagonistic force within society. Now the second point. I have always workedfor an ideal, and I don’t understand your denial of it. Would you mind goinginto this problem?”Our present morality is based on the past or the future, on the traditional, orthe what ought to be. The what ought to be is the ideal in opposition to whathas been, the future in conflict with the past. Nonviolence is the ideal, thewhat should be; and the what has been is violence. The what has been projectsthe what should be; the ideal is homemade, it is projected by its own opposite,the actual. The antithesis is an extension of the thesis; the opposite containsthe element of its own opposite. Being violent, the mind projects its opposite,the ideal of nonviolence. It is said that the ideal helps to overcome its ownopposite; but does it? Is not the ideal an avoidance, an escape from the whathas been, or from what is? The conflict between the actual and the ideal isobviously a means of postponing the understanding of the actual, and thisconflict only introduces another problem which helps to cover up the immediateproblem. The ideal is a marvelous and respectable escape from the actual. Theideal of nonviolence, like the collective utopia, is fictitious; the ideal, thewhat should be, helps us to cover up and avoid what is.The pursuit of the ideal is the search for reward. You may shun the worldlyrewards as being stupid and barbarous, which they are; but your pursuit of theideal is the search for reward at a different level, which is also stupid. Theideal is a compensation, a fictitious state which the mind has conjured up.Being violent, separate, and out for itself, the mind projects the gratifyingcompensation, the fiction which it calls the ideal, the utopia, the future, andvainly pursues it. That very pursuit is conflict, but it is also a pleasurablepostponement of the actual. The ideal, the what should be, does not help inunderstanding what is; on the contrary, it prevents understanding.“Do you mean to say that our leaders and teachers have been wrong in advocatingand maintaining the ideal?”What do you think?“If I understand correctly what you say—”Please, it is not a matter of understanding what another may say, but of findingout what is true. Truth is not opinion; truth is not dependent on any leader orteacher. The weighing of opinions only prevents the perception of truth. Eitherthe ideal is a homemade fiction which contains its own opposite, or it is not.There are no two ways about it. This does not depend on any teacher, you mustperceive the truth of it for yourself.“If the ideal is fictitious, it revolutionizes all my thinking. Do you mean tosay that our pursuit of the ideal is utterly futile?”It is a vain struggle, a gratifying self-deception, is it not?“This is very disturbing, but I am forced to admit that it is. We have taken somany things for granted that we have never allowed ourselves to observe closelywhat is in our hand. We have deceived ourselves, and what you point out upsetscompletely the structure of my thought and action. It will revolutionizeeducation, our whole way of living and working. I think I see the implicationsof a mind that is free from the ideal, from the what should be. To such a mind,action has a significance quite different from that which we give it now.Compensatory action is not action at all, but only a reaction—and we boast ofaction! But without the ideal, how is one to deal with the actual, or with thewhat has been?”The understanding of the actual is possible only when the ideal, the what shouldbe, is erased from the mind; that is, only when the false is seen as the false.The what should be is also the what should not be. As long as the mindapproaches the actual with either positive or negative compensation, there canbe no understanding of the actual. To understand the actual you must be indirect communion with it; your relationship with it cannot be through the screenof the ideal, or through the screen of the past, of tradition, of experience. Tobe free from the wrong approach is the only problem. This means, really, theunderstanding of conditioning, which is the mind. The problem is the minditself, and not the problems it breeds; the resolution of the problems bred bythe mind is merely the reconciliation of effects, and that only leads to furtherconfusion and illusion.“How is one to understand the mind?”The way of the mind is the way of life—not the ideal life, but the actual lifeof sorrow and pleasure, of deception and clarity, of conceit and the pose ofhumility. To understand the mind is to be aware of desire and fear.“Please, this is getting a bit too much for me. How am I to understand my mind?”To know the mind, must you not be aware of its activities? The mind is onlyexperience, not just the immediate, but also the accumulated. The mind is thepast in response to the present, which makes for the future. The total processof the mind has to be understood.“Where am I to begin?”From the only beginning: relationship. Relationship is life; to be is to berelated. Only in the mirror of relationship is the mind to be understood, andyou have to begin to see yourself in that mirror.“Do you mean in my relationship with my wife, with my neighbor, and so on? Isthat not a very limited process?”What may appear to be small, limited, if approached rightly, reveals thefathomless. It is like a funnel, the narrow opens into the wide. When observedwith passive watchfulness, the limited reveals the limitless. After all, at itssource the river is small, hardly worth noticing.“So I must begin with myself and my immediate relationships.”Surely. Relationship is never narrow or small. With the one or with the many,relationship is a complex process, and you can approach it pettily, or freelyand openly. Again, the approach is dependent on the state of the mind. If you donot begin with yourself, where else will you begin? Even if you begin with someperipheral activity, you are in relationship with it, the mind is the center ofit. Whether you begin near or far, you are there. Without understandingyourself, whatever you do will inevitably bring about confusion and sorrow. Thebeginning is the ending.“I have wandered far afield. I have seen and done many things, I have sufferedand laughed like so many others, and yet I have had to come back to myself. I amlike that sannyasi who set out in search of truth. He spent many years goingfrom teacher to teacher, and each pointed out a different way. At last hewearily returned to his home, and in his own house was the jewel! I see howfoolish we are, searching the universe for that bliss which is to be found onlyin our own hearts when the mind is purged of its activities. You are perfectlyright. I begin from where I started. I begin with what I am.”"},{"pageContent":"FEAR AND ESCAPE [index_split_001.html#filepos3364] We were steadily climbing, without any perceptible movement. Below us was a vastsea of clouds, white and dazzling, wave upon wave as far as the eye could see.They looked so astonishingly solid and inviting. Occasionally, as we climbedhigher in a wide circle there were breaks in this brilliant foam, and far belowwas the green earth. Above us was the clear blue sky of winter, soft andimmeasurable. A massive range of snow-covered mountains stretched from north tosouth, sparkling in the brilliant sun. These mountains reached an elevation ofover fourteen thousand feet, but we had risen above them and were stillclimbing. They were a familiar range of peaks, and they looked so near andserene. The higher peaks lay to the north, and we shot off to the south, havingreached the required altitude of twenty thousand feet.The passenger in the next seat was very talkative. He was unfamiliar with thosemountains, and had dozed as we climbed; but now he was awake and eager for atalk. It appeared that he was going out on some business for the first time; heseemed to have many interests, and spoke with considerable information aboutthem. The sea was now below us, dark and distant, and a few ships were dottedhere and there. There was not a tremor of the wings, and we passed one lightedtown after another along the coast. He was saying how difficult it was not tohave fear, not particularly of a crash, but of all the accidents of life. He wasmarried and had children, and there was always fear—not of the future alone, butof everything in general. It was a fear that had no particular object, andthough he was successful, this fear made his life weary and painful. He hadalways been rather apprehensive, but now it had become extremely persistent andhis dreams were of a frightening nature. His wife knew of his fear, but she wasnot aware of its seriousness.Fear can exist only in relation to something. As an abstraction, fear is a mereword, and the word is not the actual fear. Do you know specifically of what youare afraid?“I have never been able to lay my finger on it, and my dreams too are veryvague; but threading through them all there is fear. I have talked to friendsand doctors about it, but they have either laughed it off or otherwise not beenof much help. It has always eluded me, and I want to be free of the beastlything.”Do you really want to be free, or is that just a phrase?“I may sound casual, but I would give a great deal to be rid of this fear. I amnot a particularly religious person, but strangely enough I have prayed to haveit taken away from me. When I am interested in my work, or in a game, it isoften absent; but like some monster it is ever waiting, and soon we arecompanions again.”Have you that fear now? Are you aware now that it is somewhere about? Is thefear conscious or hidden?“I can sense it, but I do not know whether it is conscious or unconscious.”Do you sense it as something far away or near—not in space or distance, but as afeeling?“When I am aware of it, it seems to be quite close. But what has that got to dowith it?”Fear can come into being only in relation to something. That something may beyour family, your work, your preoccupation with the future, with death. Are youafraid of death?“Not particularly, though I would like to have a quick death and not a longdrawn-out one. I don’t think it is my family that I have this anxiety about, noris it my job.”Then it must be something deeper than the superficial relationships that iscausing this fear. One may be able to point out what it is, but if you candiscover it for yourself it will have far greater significance. Why are you notafraid of the superficial relationships?“My wife and I love each other; she wouldn’t think of looking at another man,and I am not attracted to other women. We find completeness in each other. Thechildren are an anxiety, and what one can do, one does; but with all thiseconomic mess in the world, one cannot give them financial security, and theywill have to do the best they can. My job is fairly secure, but there is thenatural fear of anything happening to my wife.”So you are sure of your deeper relationship. Why are you so certain?“I don’t know, but I am. One has to take some things for granted, hasn’t one?”That’s not the point. Shall we go into it? What makes you so sure of yourintimate relationship? When you say that you and your wife find completeness ineach other, what do you mean?“We find happiness in each other: companionship, understanding, and so on. Inthe deeper sense, we depend on each other. It would be a tremendous blow ifanything happened to either of us. We are in that sense dependent.”What do you mean by dependent? You mean that without her you would be lost, youwould feel utterly alone, is that it? She would feel the same; so you aremutually dependent.“But what is wrong with that?”We are not condemning or judging, but only inquiring. Are you sure you want togo into all this? You are quite sure? All right, then let’s go on.Without your wife, you would be alone, you would be lost in the deepest sense;so she is essential to you, is she not? You depend on her for your happiness,and this dependence is called love. You are afraid to be alone. She is alwaysthere to cover up the fact of your loneliness, as you cover up hers; but thefact is still there, is it not? We use each other to cover up this loneliness;we run away from it in so many ways, in so many different forms of relationship,and each such relationship becomes a dependence. I listen to the radio becausemusic makes me happy, it takes me away from myself; books and knowledge are alsoa very convenient escape from myself. And on all these things we depend.“Why should I not escape from myself? I have nothing to be proud of, and bybeing identified with my wife, who is much better than I am, I get away frommyself.”Of course, the vast majority escape from themselves. But by escaping fromyourself, you have become dependent. Dependence grows stronger, escapes moreessential, in proportion to the fear of what is. The wife, the book, the radio,become extraordinarily important; escapes come to be all-significant, of thegreatest value. I use my wife as a means of running away from myself, so I amattached to her. I must possess her, I must not lose her; and she likes to bepossessed, for she is also using me. There is a common need to escape, andmutually we use each other. This usage is called love. You do not like what youare, and so you run away from yourself, from what is.“That is fairly clear. I see something in that, it makes sense. But why does onerun away? What is one escaping from?”From your own loneliness, your own emptiness, from what you are. If you run awaywithout seeing what is. you obviously cannot understand it; so first you have tostop running, escaping, and only then can you watch yourself as you are. But youcannot observe what is if you are always criticizing it, if you like or dislikeit. You call it loneliness and run away from it; and the very running away fromwhat is is fear. You are afraid of this loneliness, of this emptiness, anddependence is the covering of it. So fear is constant; it is constant as long asyou are running away from what is. To be completely identified with something,with a person or an idea, is not a guarantee of final escape, for this fear isalways in the background. It comes through dreams, when there is a break inidentification; and there is always a break in identification, unless one isunbalanced.“Then my fear arises from my own hollowness, my insufficiency. I see that allright, and it is true; but what am I to do about it?”You cannot do anything about it. Whatever you do is an activity of escape. Thatis the most essential thing to realize. Then you will see that you are notdifferent or separate from that hollowness. You are that insufficiency. Theobserver is the observed emptiness. Then if you proceed further, there is nolonger calling it loneliness; the terming of it has ceased. If you proceed stillfurther, which is rather arduous, the thing known as loneliness is not; there isa complete cessation of loneliness, emptiness, of the thinker as the thought.This alone puts an end to fear.“Then what is love?”Love is not identification; it is not thought about the loved. You do not thinkabout love when it is there; you think about it only when it is absent, whenthere is distance between you and the object of your love. When there is directcommunion, there is no thought, no image, no revival of memory; it is when thecommunion breaks, at any level, that the process of thought, of imagination,begins. Love is not of the mind. The mind makes the smoke of envy, of holding,of missing, of recalling the past, of longing for tomorrow, of sorrow and worry;and this effectively smothers the flame. When the smoke is not, the flame is.The two cannot exist together; the thought that they exist together is merely awish. A wish is a projection of thought, and thought is not love."},{"pageContent":"TIME AND TRANSFORMATION [index_split_001.html#filepos3509] I would like to talk a little about time, because I think the enrichment, thebeauty and significance of that which is timeless, of that which is true, can beexperienced only when we understand the whole process of time. After all, we areseeking, each in his own way, a sense of happiness, of enrichment. Surely a lifethat has significance, the riches of true happiness, is not of time. Like love,such a life is timeless; and to understand that which is timeless, we must notapproach it through time but rather understand time. We must not utilize time asa means of attaining, realizing, apprehending, the timeless. That is what we aredoing most of our lives: spending time trying to grasp that which is timeless,so it is important to understand what we mean by time, because I think it ispossible to be free of time. It is very important to understand time as a wholeand not partially.It is interesting to realize that our lives are mostly spent in time—time, notin the sense of chronological sequence, of minutes, hours, days, and years, butin the sense of psychological memory. We live by time, we are the result oftime. Our minds are the product of many yesterdays and the present is merely thepassage of the past to the future. Our minds, our activities, our being, arefounded on time; without time we cannot think, because thought is the result oftime, thought is the product of many yesterdays and there is no thought withoutmemory. Memory is time, for there are two kinds of time, the chronological andthe psychological. There is time as yesterday by the watch and as yesterday bymemory. You cannot reject chronological time; it would be absurd—you would missyour train. But is there really any time at all apart from chronological time?Obviously there is time as yesterday but is there time as the mind thinks of it?Is there time apart from the mind? Surely time, psychological time, is theproduct of the mind. Without the foundation of thought there is no time—timemerely being memory as yesterday in conjunction with today, which moldstomorrow. That is, memory of yesterday’s experience in response to the presentis creating the future, which is still the process of thought, a path of themind. The thought process brings about psychological progress in time but is itreal, as real as chronological time? And can we use that time which is of themind as a means of understanding the eternal, the timeless? As I said, happinessis not of yesterday, happiness is not the product of time, happiness is alwaysin the present, a timeless state. I do not know if you have noticed that whenyou have ecstasy, a creative joy, a series of bright clouds surrounded by darkclouds, in that moment there is no time: there is only the immediate present.The mind, coming in after the experiencing in the present, remembers and wishesto continue it, gathering more and more of itself, thereby creating time. Sotime is created by the “more”; time is acquisition and time is also detachment,which is still an acquisition of the mind. Therefore, merely disciplining themind in time, conditioning thought within the framework of time, which ismemory, surely does not reveal that which is timeless.Is transformation a matter of time? Most of us are accustomed to thinking thattime is necessary for transformation: I am something, and to change what I aminto what I should be requires time. I am greedy, with greed’s results ofconfusion, antagonism, conflict, and misery; to bring about the transformation,which is nongreed, we think time is necessary. That is to say, time isconsidered as a means of evolving something greater, of becoming something. Theproblem is this: One is violent, greedy, envious, angry, vicious, or passionate.To transform what is, is time necessary? First of all, why do we want to changewhat is, or bring about a transformation? Why? Because what we are dissatisfiesus; it creates conflict, disturbance, and disliking that state we want somethingbetter, something nobler, more idealistic. Therefore, we desire transformationbecause there is pain, discomfort, conflict. Is conflict overcome by time? Ifyou say it will be overcome by time, you are still in conflict. You may say itwill take twenty days or twenty years to get rid of conflict, to change what youare, but during that time you are still in conflict and, therefore, time doesnot bring about transformation. When we use time as a means of acquiring aquality, a virtue, or a state of being, we are merely postponing or avoidingwhat is; and I think it is important to understand this point. Greed or violencecause pain, disturbance in the world of our relationship with another, which issociety; and being conscious of this state of disturbance, which we term greedor violence, we say to ourselves, “I will get out of it in time. I will practicenonviolence, I will practice non-envy, I will practice peace.” Now, you want topractice nonviolence because violence is a state of disturbance, conflict, andyou think that in time you will gain nonviolence and overcome the conflict. Whatis actually happening? Being in a state of conflict you want to achieve a statein which there is no conflict. Now is that state of no conflict the result oftime, of a duration? Obviously not, because while you are achieving a state ofnonviolence, you are still being violent and are, therefore, still in conflict.Our problem is, can a conflict, a disturbance, be overcome in a period of time,whether it be days, years, or lives? What happens when you say, “I am going topractice nonviolence” during a certain period of time? The very practiceindicates that you are in conflict, does it not? You would not practice if youwere not resisting conflict; you say the resistance to conflict is necessary inorder to overcome conflict and for that resistance you must have time. But thevery resistance to conflict is itself a form of conflict. You are spending yourenergy in resisting conflict in the form of what you call greed, envy, orviolence but your mind is still in conflict, so it is important to see thefalseness of the process of depending on time as a means of overcoming violenceand thereby being free of that process. Then you are able to be what you are: apsychological disturbance which is violence itself.To understand anything, any human or scientific problem, what is important, whatis essential? A quiet mind, is it not? A mind that is intent on understanding.It is not a mind that is exclusive, that is trying to concentrate, which againis an effort of resistance. If I really want to understand something, there isimmediately a quiet state of mind. When you want to listen to music or look at apicture which you love, which you have a feeling for, what is the state of yourmind? Immediately there is a quietness, is there not? When you are listening tomusic, your mind does not wander all over the place; you are listening.Similarly, when you want to understand conflict, you are no longer depending ontime at all; you are simply confronted with what is, which is conflict. Thenimmediately there comes a quietness, a stillness of mind. When you no longerdepend on time as a means of transforming what is because you see the falsenessof that process, then you are confronted with what is. and as you are interestedto understand what is, naturally you have a quiet mind. In that alert yetpassive state of mind there is understanding. So long as the mind is inconflict, blaming, resisting, condemning, there can be no understanding. If Iwant to understand you, I must not condemn you, obviously. It is that quietmind, that still mind, which brings about transformation. When the mind is nolonger resisting, no longer avoiding, no longer discarding or blaming what isbut is simply passively aware, then in that passivity of the mind you will find,if you really go into the problem, that there comes a transformation.Revolution is only possible now, not in the future; regeneration is today, nottomorrow. If you will experiment with what I have been saying, you will findthat there is immediate regeneration, a newness, a quality of freshness; becausethe mind is always still when it is interested, when it desires or has theintention to understand. The difficulty with most of us is that we have not theintention to understand, because we are afraid that, if we understood, it mightbring about a revolutionary action in our life and, therefore, we resist. It isthe defense mechanism that is at work when we use time or an ideal as a means ofgradual transformation.Thus, regeneration is only possible in the present, not in the future, nottomorrow. A man who relies on time as a means through which he can gainhappiness or realize truth or God is merely deceiving himself; he is living inignorance and, therefore, in conflict. A man who sees that time is not the wayout of our difficulty and who is, therefore, free from the false, such a mannaturally has the intention to understand; therefore, his mind is quietspontaneously, without compulsion, without practice. When the mind is still,tranquil, not seeking any answer or any solution, neither resisting noravoiding—it is only then that there can be a regeneration, because then the mindis capable of perceiving what is true; and it is truth that liberates, not youreffort to be free."},{"pageContent":"SORROW FROM SELF-PITY [index_split_001.html#filepos3662] At this time of the year, in this warm climate, it was spring. The sun wasexceptionally mild, for a light wind was coming from the north where themountains were fresh in the snow. A tree beside the road, bare a week ago, wasnow covered with new green leaves which sparkled in the sun. The new leaves wereso tender, so delicate, so small in the vast space of the mind, of the earth andthe blue sky; yet within a short time they seemed to fill the space of allthought. Further along the road there was a flowering tree which had no leaves,but only blossoms. The breeze had scattered the petals on the ground, andseveral children were sitting among them. They were the children of thechauffeurs and other servants. They would never go to school; they would alwaysbe the poor people of the earth, but among the fallen petals beside the tarredroad, those children were part of the earth. They were startled to see astranger sitting there with them, and they became suddenly silent; they stoppedplaying with the petals, and for a few seconds they were as still as statues.But their eyes were alive with curiosity, friendliness, and apprehension.In a small, sunken garden by the roadside there were quantities of brightflowers. Among the leaves of a tree in that garden a crow was shading itselffrom the midday sun. Its whole body was resting on the branch, the featherscovering its claws. It was calling or answering other crows, and within a periodof ten minutes there were five or six different notes in its cawing. It probablyhad many more notes, but now it was satisfied with a few. It was very black,with a gray neck; it had extraordinary eyes which were never still, and its beakwas hard and sharp. It was completely at rest and yet completely alive. It wasstrange how the mind was totally with that bird. It was not observing the bird,though it had taken in every detail; it was not the bird itself, for there wasno identification with it. It was with the bird, with its eyes and its sharpbeak, as the sea is with the fish; it was with the bird, and yet it went throughand beyond it. The sharp, aggressive, and frightened mind of the crow was partof the mind that spanned the seas and time. This mind was vast, limitless,beyond all measure, and yet it was aware of the slightest movement of the eyesof that black crow among the new, sparkling leaves. It was aware of the fallingpetals, but it had no focus of attention, no point from which to attend. Unlikespace, which has always something in it—a particle of dust, the earth, or theheavens—it was wholly empty, and being empty it could attend without a cause.Its attention had neither root nor branch. All energy was in that emptystillness. It was not the energy that is built up with intent, and which is soondissipated when pressure is taken away. It was the energy of all beginning; itwas life that had no time as ending.Several people had come together, and as each one tried to state some problem,the others began to explain it and to compare it with their own trials. Butsorrow is not to be compared. Comparison breeds self-pity, and then misfortuneensues. Adversity is to be met directly, not with the idea that yours is greaterthan another’s.They were all silent now, and presently one of them began.“My mother has been dead for some years. Quite recently I have lost my fatheralso, and I am full of remorse. He was a good father, and I ought to have beenmany things which I was not. Our ideas clashed; our respective ways of life keptus apart. He was a religious man, but my religious feeling is not so obvious.The relationship between us was often strained, but at least it was arelationship, and now that he is gone I am stricken with sorrow. My sorrow isnot only remorse, but also the feeling of suddenly being left alone. I havenever had this kind of sorrow before, and it is quite acute. What am I to do?How am I to get over it?”If one may ask, do you suffer for your father, or does sorrow arise from havingno longer the relationship to which you had grown accustomed?“I don’t quite understand what you mean.”Do you suffer because your father is gone or because you feel lonely?“All I know is that I suffer, and I want to get away from it. I really don’tunderstand what you mean. Will you please explain?”It is fairly simple, is it not? Either you are suffering on behalf of yourfather, that is, because he enjoyed living and wanted to live, and now he isgone; or you are suffering because there has been a break in a relationship thathad significance for so long, and you are suddenly aware of loneliness. Now,which is it? You are suffering surely, not for your father, but because you arelonely, and your sorrow is that which comes from self-pity.“What exactly is loneliness?”Have you never felt lonely?“Yes, I have often taken solitary walks. I go for long walks alone, especiallyon my holidays.”Isn’t there a difference between the feeling of loneliness and being alone as ona solitary walk?“If there is, then I don’t think I know what loneliness means.”“I don’t think we know what anything means, except verbally,” someone added.Have you never experienced for yourself the feeling of loneliness, as you mighta toothache? When we talk of loneliness, are we experiencing the psychologicalpain of it, or merely employing a word to indicate something which we have neverdirectly experienced? Do we really suffer, or only think we suffer?“I want to know what loneliness is,” he replied.You mean you want a description of it. It’s an experience of being completelyisolated; a feeling of not being able to depend on anything, of being cut offfrom all relationship. The “me,” the ego, the self, by its very nature, isconstantly building a wall around itself; all its activity leads to isolation.Becoming aware of its isolation, it begins to identify itself with virtue, withGod, with property, with a person, country, or ideology; but this identificationis part of the process of isolation. In other words, we escape by every possiblemeans from the pain of loneliness, from this feeling of isolation, and so wenever directly experience it. It’s like being afraid of something round thecorner and never facing it, never finding out what it is, but always runningaway and taking refuge in somebody or something, which only breeds more fear.Have you never felt lonely in this sense of being cut off from everything,completely isolated?“I have no idea at all what you are talking about.”Then, if one may ask, do you really know what sorrow is? Are you experiencingsorrow as strongly and urgently as you would a toothache? When you have atoothache, you act; you go to the dentist. But when there is sorrow you run awayfrom it through explanation, belief, drink, and so on. You act, but your actionis not the action that frees the mind from sorrow, is it?“I don’t know what to do, and that’s why I’m here.”Before you can know what to do, must you not find out what sorrow actually is?Haven’t you merely formed an idea, a judgment, of what sorrow is? Surely, therunning away, the evaluation, the fear, prevents you from experiencing itdirectly. When you are suffering from a toothache you don’t form ideas andopinions about it; you just have it and you act. But here there is no action,immediate or remote, because you are really not suffering. To suffer and tounderstand suffering, you must look at it, you must not run away.“My father is gone beyond recall, and so I suffer. What must I do to go beyondthe reaches of suffering?”We suffer because we do not see the truth of suffering. The fact and ourideation about the fact are entirely distinct, leading in two differentdirections. If one may ask, are you concerned with the fact, the actuality, ormerely with the idea of suffering?“You are not answering my question, sir. What am I to do?”Do you want to escape from suffering, or to be free from it? If you merely wantto escape, then a pill, a belief, an explanation, an amusement, may “help,” withthe inevitable consequences of dependence, fear, and so on. But if you wish tobe free from sorrow, you must stop running away and be aware of it withoutjudgment, without choice; you must observe it, learn about it, know all theintimate intricacies of it. Then you will not be frightened of it, and therewill no longer be the poison of self-pity. With the understanding of sorrowthere is freedom from it. To understand sorrow there must be the actualexperiencing of it, and not the verbal fiction of sorrow.“May I just ask just one question?” put in one of the others. “In what mannershould one live one’s daily life?”As though one were living for that single day, for that single hour.“How?”If you had only one hour to live, what would you do?“I really don’t know,” he replied anxiously.Would you not arrange what is necessary outwardly, your affairs, your will, andso on? Would you not call your family and friends together and ask theirforgiveness for the harm that you might have done to them, and forgive them forwhatever harm they might have done to you? Would you not die completely to thethings of the mind, to desires, and to the world? And if it can be done for anhour then it can also be done for the days and years that may remain.“Is such a thing really possible, sir?”Try it and you will find out."},{"pageContent":"EDUCATION AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LIFE [index_split_001.html#filepos3813] When one travels around the world, one notices to what an extraordinary degreehuman nature is the same, whether in India or America, in Europe or Australia.This is especially true in colleges and universities. We are turning out, as ifthrough a mold, a type of human being whose chief interest is to find security,to become somebody important, or to have a good time with as little thought aspossible.Conventional education makes independent thinking extremely difficult.Conformity leads to mediocrity. To be different from the group or to resistenvironment is not easy and is often risky as long as we worship success. Theurge to be successful, which is the pursuit of reward whether in the material orin the so-called spiritual sphere, the search for inward or outward security,the desire for comfort—this whole process smothers discontent, puts an end tospontaneity and breeds fear; and fear blocks the intelligent understanding oflife. With increasing age, dullness of mind and heart sets in.In seeking comfort, we generally find a quiet corner in life where there is aminimum of conflict, and then we are afraid to step out of that seclusion. Thisfear of life, this fear of struggle and of new experience, kills in us thespirit of adventure; our whole upbringing and education have made us afraid tobe different from our neighbor, afraid to think contrary to the establishedpattern of society, falsely respectful of authority and tradition.Fortunately, there are a few who are in earnest, who are willing to examine ourhuman problems without the prejudice of the right or of the left; but in thevast majority of us, there is no real spirit of discontent, of revolt. When weyield uncomprehendingly to environment, any spirit of revolt that we may havehad dies down, and our responsibilities soon put an end to it.Revolt is of two kinds: there is violent revolt, which is mere reaction, withoutunderstanding, against the existing order; and there is the deep psychologicalrevolt of intelligence. There are many who revolt against the establishedorthodoxies only to fall into new orthodoxies, further illusions and concealedself-indulgences. What generally happens is that we break away from one group orset of ideals and join another group, take up other ideals, thus creating a newpattern of thought against which we will again have to revolt. Reaction onlybreeds opposition, and reform needs further reform.But there is an intelligent revolt which is not reaction, and which comes withself-knowledge through the awareness of one’s own thought and feeling. It isonly when we face experience as it comes and do not avoid disturbance that wekeep intelligence highly awakened; and intelligence highly awakened isintuition, which is the only true guide in life.Now, what is the significance of life? What are we living and struggling for? Ifwe are being educated merely to achieve distinction, to get a better job, to bemore efficient, to have wider domination over others, then our lives will beshallow and empty. If we are being educated only to be scientists, to bescholars wedded to books, or specialists addicted to knowledge, then we shall becontributing to the destruction and misery of the world.Though there is a higher and wider significance to life, of what value is oureducation if we never discover it? We may be highly educated, but if we arewithout deep integration of thought and feeling, our lives are incomplete,contradictory, and torn with many fears; and as long as education does notcultivate an integrated outlook on life, it has very little significance.In our present civilization we have divided life into so many departments thateducation has very little meaning, except in learning a particular technique orprofession. Instead of awakening the integrated intelligence of the individual,education is encouraging him to conform to a pattern and so is hindering hiscomprehension of himself as a total process. To attempt to solve the manyproblems of existence at their respective levels, separated as they are intovarious categories, indicates an utter lack of comprehension.The individual is made up of different entities, but to emphasize thedifferences and to encourage the development of a definite type leads to manycomplexities and contradictions. Education should bring about the integration ofthese separate entities, for without integration, life becomes a series ofconflicts and sorrows. Of what value is it to be trained as lawyers if weperpetuate litigation? Of what value is knowledge if we continue in ourconfusion? What significance has technical and industrial capacity if we use itto destroy one another? What is the point of our existence if it leads toviolence and utter misery? Though we may have money or are capable of earningit, though we have our pleasures and our organized religions, we are in endlessconflict.We must distinguish between the personal and the individual. The personal is theaccidental; and by the accidental I mean the circumstances of birth, theenvironment in which we happen to have been brought up, with its nationalism,superstitions, class distinctions and prejudices. The personal or accidental isbut momentary, though that moment may last a lifetime; and as the present systemof education is based on the personal, the accidental, the momentary, it leadsto perversion of thought and the inculcation of self-defensive fears.All of us have been trained by education and environment to seek personal gainand security, and to fight for ourselves. Though we cover it over with pleasantphrases, we have been educated for various professions within a system based onexploitation and acquisitive fear. Such a training must inevitably bringconfusion and misery to ourselves and to the world, for it creates in eachindividual those psychological barriers which separate and hold him apart fromothers.Education is not merely a matter of training the mind. Training makes forefficiency, but it does not bring about completeness. A mind that has merelybeen trained is the continuation of the past, and such a mind can never discoverthe new. That is why, to find out what is right education, we will have toinquire into the whole significance of living.To most of us, the meaning of life as a whole is not of primary importance, andour education emphasizes secondary values, merely making us proficient in somebranch of knowledge. Though knowledge and efficiency are necessary, to lay chiefemphasis on them only leads to conflict and confusion.There is an efficiency inspired by love which goes far beyond and is muchgreater than the efficiency of ambition; and without love, which brings anintegrated understanding of life, efficiency breeds ruthlessness. Is this notwhat is actually taking place all over the world? Our present education isgeared to industrialization and war, its principal aim being to developefficiency; and we are caught in this machine of ruthless competition and mutualdestruction. If education leads to war, if it teaches us to destroy or bedestroyed, has it not utterly failed?To bring about right education, we must obviously understand the meaning of lifeas a whole, and for that we have to be able to think, not consistently, butdirectly and truly. A consistent thinker is a thoughtless person, because heconforms to a pattern; he repeats phrases and thinks in a groove. We cannotunderstand existence abstractly or theoretically. To understand life is tounderstand ourselves, and that is both the beginning and the end of education.Education is not merely acquiring knowledge, gathering and correlating facts; itis to see the significance of life as a whole. But the whole cannot beapproached through the part, which is what governments, organized religions, andauthoritarian parties are attempting to do.The function of education is to create human beings who are integrated and,therefore, intelligent. We may take degrees and be mechanically efficientwithout being intelligent. Intelligence is not mere information; it is notderived from books, nor does it consist of clever self-defensive responses andaggressive assertions. One who has not studied may be more intelligent than thelearned. We have made examinations and degrees the criterion of intelligence andhave developed cunning minds that avoid vital human issues. Intelligence is thecapacity to perceive the essential, the what is; and to awaken this capacity, inoneself and in others, is education.Education should help us to discover lasting values so that we do not merelycling to formulas or repeat slogans; it should help us to break down ournational and social barriers, instead of emphasizing them, for they breedantagonism between man and man. Unfortunately, the present system of educationis making us subservient, mechanical, and deeply thoughtless; though it awakensus intellectually, inwardly it leaves us incomplete, stultified, and uncreative.Without an integrated understanding of life, our individual and collectiveproblems will only deepen and extend. The purpose of education is not to producemere scholars, technicians, and job hunters, but integrated men and women whoare free of fear; for only between such human beings can there be enduringpeace.It is in the understanding of ourselves that fear comes to an end. If theindividual is to grapple with life from moment to moment, if he is to face itsintricacies, its miseries and sudden demands, he must be infinitely pliable and,therefore, free of theories and particular patterns of thought.Education should not encourage the individual to conform to society or to benegatively harmonious with it, but help him to discover the true values whichcome with unbiased investigation and self-awareness. When there is noself-knowledge, self-expression becomes self-assertion, with all its aggressiveand ambitious conflicts. Education should awaken the capacity to be self-awareand not merely indulge in gratifying self-expression.What is the good of learning if in the process of living we are destroyingourselves? As we are having a series of devastating wars, one right afteranother, there is obviously something radically wrong with the way we bring upour children. I think most of us are aware of this, but we do not know how todeal with it.Systems, whether educational or political, are not changed mysteriously; theyare transformed when there is a fundamental change in ourselves. The individualis of first importance, not the system; and as long as the individual does notunderstand the total process of himself, no system, whether of the left or ofthe right, can bring order and peace to the world."},{"pageContent":"LIFE AHEAD [index_split_001.html#filepos3981] It seems to me that a totally different kind of morality and conduct, and anaction that springs from the understanding of the whole process of living, havebecome an urgent necessity, in our world of mounting crises and problems. We tryto deal with these issues through political and organizational methods, througheconomic readjustment and various reforms; but none of these things will everresolve the complex difficulties of human existence, though they may offertemporary relief. All reforms, however extensive and seemingly lasting, are inthemselves merely productive of further confusion and further need ofreformation. Without understanding the whole complex being of man, merereformation will bring about only the confusing demand for further reforms.There is no end to reform; and there is no fundamental solution along theselines.Political, economic, or social revolutions are not the answer either, for theyhave produced appalling tyrannies, or the mere transfer of power and authorityinto the hands of a different group. Such revolutions are not at any time theway out of our confusion and conflict.But there is a revolution which is entirely different and which must take placeif we are to emerge from the endless series of anxieties, conflicts, andfrustrations in which we are caught. This revolution has to begin not withtheory and ideation, which eventually prove worthless, but with a radicaltransformation in the mind itself. Such a transformation can be brought aboutonly through right education and the total development of the human being. It isa revolution that must take place in the whole of the mind and not merely inthought. Thought, after all, is only a result and not the source. There must beradical transformation of the source and not mere modification of the result. Atpresent we are tinkering with results, with symptoms. We are not bringing abouta vital change, uprooting the old ways of thought, freeing the mind fromtraditions and habits. It is with this vital change we are concerned and onlyright education can bring it into being.To inquire and to learn is the function of the mind. By learning I do not meanthe mere cultivation of memory or the accumulation of knowledge, but thecapacity to think clearly and sanely without illusion, to start from facts andnot from beliefs and ideals. There is no learning if thought originates fromconclusions. To merely acquire information or knowledge is not to learn.Learning implies the love of understanding and the love of doing a thing foritself. Learning is possible only when there is no coercion of any kind. Andcoercion takes many forms, does it not? There is coercion through influence,through attachment or threat, through persuasive encouragement or subtle formsof reward.Most people think that learning is encouraged through comparison, whereas thecontrary is the fact. Comparison brings about frustration and merely encouragesenvy, which is called competition. Like other forms of persuasion, comparisonprevents learning and breeds fear. Ambition also breeds fear. Ambition, whetherpersonal or identified with the collective, is always antisocial. So-callednoble ambition in relationship is fundamentally destructive.It is necessary to encourage the development of a good mind—a mind which iscapable of dealing with the many issues of life as a whole, and which does nottry to escape from them and so become self-contradictory, frustrated, bitter, orcynical. And it is essential for the mind to be aware of its own conditioning,its own motives and pursuits.Since the development of a good mind is one of our chief concerns, how oneteaches becomes very important. There must be a cultivation of the totality ofthe mind, and not merely the giving of information. In the process of impartingknowledge, the educator has to invite discussion and encourage the students toinquire and to think independently.Authority, as “the one who knows,” has no place in learning. The educator andthe student are both learning through their special relationship with eachother, but this does not mean that the educator disregards the orderliness ofthought. Orderliness of thought is not brought about by discipline in the formof assertive statements of knowledge; but it comes into being naturally when theeducator understands that in cultivating intelligence there must be a sense offreedom. This does not mean freedom to do whatever one likes, or to think in thespirit of mere contradiction. It is the freedom in which the student is beinghelped to be aware of his own urges and motives, which are revealed to himthrough his daily thought and action.A disciplined mind is never a free mind, nor can a mind that has suppresseddesire ever be free. It is only through understanding the whole process ofdesire that the mind can be free. Discipline always limits the mind to amovement within the framework of a particular system of thought or belief, doesit not? And such a mind is never free to be intelligent. Discipline brings aboutsubmission to authority. It gives the capacity to function within the pattern ofa society which demands functional ability, but it does not awaken theintelligence which has its own capacity. The mind that has cultivated nothingbut capacity through memory is like the modern electronic computer which, thoughit functions with astonishing ability and accuracy, is still only a machine.Authority can persuade the mind to think in a particular direction. But beingguided to think along certain lines, or in terms of a foregone conclusion, isnot to think at all; it is merely to function like a human machine, which breedsthoughtless discontent, bringing with it frustration and other miseries.We are concerned with the total development of each human being, helping him torealize his own highest and fullest capacity—not some fictitious capacity whichthe educator has in view as a concept or an ideal. Any spirit of comparisonprevents this full flowering of the individual, whether he is to be a scientistor a gardener. The fullest capacity of the gardener is the same as the fullestcapacity of the scientist when there is no comparison; but when comparison comesin, then there is the disparagement and the envious reactions which createconflict between man and man. Like sorrow, love is not comparative; it cannot becompared with the greater or the lesser. Sorrow is sorrow, as love is love,whether it be in the rich or in the poor.The fullest development of every individual creates a society of equals. Thepresent social struggle to bring about equality on the economic or somespiritual level has no meaning at all. Social reforms aimed at establishingequality breed other forms of antisocial activity, but with right education,there is no need to seek equality through social and other reforms, becauseenvy, with its comparison of capacities, ceases.We must differentiate here between function and status. Status, with all itsemotional and hierarchical prestige, arises only through the comparison offunctions as the high and the low. When each individual is flowering to hisfullest capacity, there is then no comparison of functions; there is only theexpression of capacity as a teacher, or a prime minister, or a gardener, and sostatus loses its sting of envy.Functional or technical capacity is now recognized through having a degree afterone’s name; but if we are truly concerned with the total development of thehuman being, our approach is entirely different. An individual who has thecapacity may take a degree and add letters after his name, or he may not, as hepleases. But he will know for himself his own deep capabilities, which will notbe framed by a degree, and their expression will not bring about thatself-centered confidence which mere technical capacity usually breeds. Suchconfidence is comparative and, therefore, antisocial. Comparison may exist forutilitarian purpose; but it is not for the educator to compare the capacities ofhis students and give greater or lesser evaluation.Since we are concerned with the total development of the individual, the studentmay not be allowed in the beginning to choose his own subjects, because hischoice is likely to be based on passing moods and prejudices, or on finding theeasiest thing to do; or he may choose according to the immediate demands of aparticular need. But if he is helped to discover by himself and to cultivate hisinnate capacities, then he will naturally choose not the easiest subjects, butthose through which he can express his capacities to the fullest and highestextent. If the student is helped from the very beginning to look at life as awhole, with all its psychological, intellectual, and emotional problems, he willnot be frightened by it.Intelligence is the capacity to deal with life as a whole; and giving grades ormarks to the student does not assure intelligence. On the contrary, it degradeshuman dignity. This comparative evaluation cripples the mind, which does notmean that the teacher must not observe the progress of every student and keep arecord of it. Parents, naturally anxious to know the progress of their children,will want a report; but if, unfortunately, they do not understand what theeducator is trying to do, the report will become an instrument of coercion toproduce the results they desire, and so undo the work of the educator.Parents should understand the kind of education the school intends to give.Generally they are satisfied to see their children preparing to get a degree ofsome kind which will assure them of a livelihood. Very few are concerned withmore than this. Of course, they wish to see their children happy, but beyondthis vague desire very few give any thought to their total development. As mostparents desire above all else that their children should have a successfulcareer, they frighten or affectionately bully them into acquiring knowledge, andso the book becomes very important; and with it there is the mere cultivation ofmemory, the mere repetition without the quality of real thought behind it.Perhaps the greatest difficulty the educator has to face is the indifference ofparents to a wider and deeper education. Most parents are concerned only withthe cultivation of some superficial knowledge that will secure their childrenrespectable positions in a corrupt society. So the educator not only has toeducate the children in the right way, but also to see to it that the parents donot undo whatever good may have been done at the school. Really the school andthe home should be joint centers of right education, and should in no way beopposed to each other, with the parents desiring one thing and the educatordoing something entirely different. It is very important that the parents befully acquainted with what the educator is doing and be vitally interested inthe total development of their children. It is as much the responsibility of theparents to see that this kind of education is carried out as it is of theteachers, whose burden is already sufficiently heavy. A total development of thechild can be brought about only when there is the right relationship between theteacher, the student, and the parents. As the educator cannot yield to thepassing fancies or obstinate demands of the parents, it is necessary for them tounderstand the educator and cooperate with him, and not bring about conflict andconfusion in their children.The child’s natural curiosity, the urge to learn, exists from the verybeginning, and surely this should be intelligently encouraged continually, sothat it remains vital and without distortion, and will gradually lead him to thestudy of a variety of subjects. If this eagerness to learn is encouraged in thechild at all times, then his study of mathematics, geography, history, science,or any other subject, will not be a problem to the child or to the educator.Learning is facilitated when there is an atmosphere of happy affection andthoughtful care.Emotional openness and sensitivity can be cultivated only when the student feelssecure in his relationship with his teachers. The feeling of being secure inrelationship is a primary need of children. There is a vast difference betweenthe feeling of being secure and the feeling of dependency. Consciously orunconsciously, most educators cultivate the feeling of dependency, and therebysubtly encourage fear, which the parents also do in their own affectionate oraggressive manner. Dependency in the child is brought about by authoritarian ordogmatic assertions on the part of parents and teachers as to what the childmust be and do. With dependency there is always the shadow of fear, and thisfear compels the child to obey, to conform, to accept without thought the edictsand sanctions of his elders. In this atmosphere of dependency, sensitivity iscrushed, but when the child knows and feels that he is secure, his emotionalflowering is not thwarted by fear.This sense of security in the child is not the opposite of insecurity. It is thefeeling of being at ease, whether in his own home or at school, the feeling thathe can be what he is, without being compelled in any way; that he can climb atree and not be scolded if he falls. He can have this sense of security onlywhen the parents and the educators are deeply concerned with the total welfareof the child.It is important in a school that the child should feel at ease, completelysecure from the very first day. This first impression is of the highestimportance. But if the educator artificially tries by various means to gain thechild’s confidence and allows him to do what he likes, then the educator iscultivating dependency; he is not giving the child the feeling of being secure,the feeling that he is in a place where there are people who are deeplyconcerned with his total welfare.The very first impact of this new relationship based on confidence, which thechild may never have had before, will help toward a natural communication,without the young regarding the elders as a threat to be feared. A child whofeels secure has his own natural ways of expressing the respect which isessential for learning. This respect is denuded of all authority and fear. Whenhe has a feeling of security, the child’s conduct or behavior is not somethingimposed by an elder, but becomes part of the process of learning. Because hefeels secure in his relationship with the teacher, the child will naturally beconsiderate; and it is only in this atmosphere of security that emotionalopenness and sensitivity can flower. Being at ease, feeling secure, the childwill do what he likes; but in doing what he likes, he will find out what is theright thing to do, and his conduct then will not be due to resistance, orobstinacy, or suppressed feelings, or the mere expression of a momentary urge.Sensitivity means being sensitive to everything around one—to the plants, theanimals, the trees, the skies, the waters of the river, the bird on the wing;and also to the moods of the people around one, and to the stranger who passesby. This sensitivity brings about the quality of uncalculated, unselfishresponse, which is true morality and conduct. Being sensitive, the child in hisconduct will be open and not secretive; therefore, a mere suggestion on the partof the teacher will be accepted easily, without resistance or friction.As we are concerned with the total development of the human being, we mustunderstand his emotional urges, which are very much stronger than intellectualreasoning; we must cultivate emotional capacity and not help to suppress it.When we understand and are, therefore, capable of dealing with emotional as wellas intellectual issues, there will be no sense of fear in approaching them. Forthe total development of the human being, solitude as a means of cultivatingsensitivity becomes a necessity. One has to know what it is to be alone, what itis to meditate, what it is to die; and the implications of solitude, ofmeditation, of death, can be known only by seeking them out. These implicationscannot be taught, they must be learned. One can indicate, but learning by whatis indicated is not the experiencing of solitude or meditation. To experiencewhat is solitude and what is meditation, one must be in a state of inquiry; onlya mind that is in a state of inquiry is capable of learning. But when inquiry issuppressed by previous knowledge, or by the authority and experience of another,then learning becomes mere imitation, and imitation causes a human being torepeat what is learned without experiencing it.Teaching is not the mere imparting of information but the cultivation of aninquiring mind. Such a mind will penetrate into the question of what isreligion, and not merely accept the established religions with their temples andrituals. The search for God, or truth, or whatever one may like to name it—andnot the mere acceptance of belief and dogma—is true religion.Just as the student cleans his teeth every day, bathes every day, learns newthings every day, so also there must be the action of sitting quietly withothers or by himself. This solitude cannot be brought about by instruction, orurged by the external authority of tradition, or induced by the influence ofthose who want to sit quietly but are incapable of being alone. Solitude helpsthe mind to see itself clearly, as in a mirror, and to free itself from the vainendeavor of ambition with all its complexities, fears, and frustrations, whichare the outcome of self-centered activity. Solitude gives to the mind astability, a constancy which is not to be measured in terms of time. Suchclarity of mind is character. The lack of character is the state ofself-contradiction.To be sensitive is to love. The word love is not love. And love is not to bedivided as the love of God and the love of man, nor is it to be measured as thelove of the one and of the many. Love gives itself abundantly as a flower givesits perfume; but we are always measuring love in our relationship and therebydestroying it.Love is not a commodity of the reformer or the social worker; it is not apolitical instrument with which to create action. When the politician and thereformer speak of love, they are using the word and do not touch the reality ofit; for love cannot be employed as a means to an end, whether in the immediateor in the far-off future. Love is of the whole earth and not of a particularfield or forest. The love of reality is not encompassed by any religion; andwhen organized religions use it, it ceases to be. Societies, organizedreligions, and authoritarian governments, sedulous in their various activities,unknowingly destroy the love that becomes passion in action.In the total development of the human being through right education, the qualityof love must be nourished and sustained from the very beginning. Love is notsentimentality, nor is it devotion. It is as strong as death. Love cannot bebought through knowledge; and a mind that is pursuing knowledge without love isa mind that deals in ruthlessness and aims merely at efficiency.So the educator must be concerned from the very beginning with this quality oflove, which is humility, gentleness, consideration, patience, and courtesy.Modesty and courtesy are innate in the man of right education; he is considerateto all, including the animals and plants, and this is reflected in his behaviorand manner of talking.The emphasis on this quality of love frees the mind from its absorption in itsambition, greed, and acquisitiveness. Does not love have about it a refinementwhich expresses itself as respect and good taste? Does it not also bring aboutthe purification of the mind, which otherwise has a tendency to strengthenitself in pride? Refinement in behavior is not a self-imposed adjustment or theresult of an outward demand; it comes spontaneously with this quality of love.When there is the understanding of love, then sex and all the complications andsubtleties of human relationship can be approached with sanity and not withexcitement and apprehension.The educator to whom the total development of the human being is of primaryimportance must understand the implications of the sexual urge which plays suchan important part in our life, and be able from the very beginning to meet thechildren’s natural curiosity without arousing a morbid interest. Merely toimpart biological information at the adolescent age may lead to experimentallust if the quality of love is not felt. Love cleanses the mind of evil. Withoutlove and understanding on the part of the educator, merely to separate the boysfrom the girls, whether by barbed wire or by edicts, only strengthens theircuriosity and stimulates that passion which is bound to degenerate into meresatisfaction. So it is important that boys and girls be educated togetherrightly.This quality of love must express itself also in doing things with one’s hands,such as gardening, carpentry, painting, handicrafts; and through the senses, asseeing the trees, the mountains, the richness of the earth, the poverty that menhave created amongst themselves; and in healing music, the song of the birds,the murmur of running waters.We are concerned not only with the cultivation of the mind and the awakening ofemotional sensitivity, but also with a well-rounded development of the physique,and to this we must give considerable thought. For if the body is not healthy,vital, it will inevitably distort thought and make for insensitivity. This is soobvious that we need not go into it in detail. It is necessary that the body bein excellent health, that it be given the right kind of food and have sufficientsleep. If the senses are not alert, the body will impede the total developmentof the human being. To have grace of movement and well-balanced control of themuscles, there must be various forms of exercise, dancing, and games. A bodythat is not kept clean, that is sloppy and does not hold itself in good posture,is not conducive to sensitivity of mind and emotions. The body is not theinstrument of the mind, but body, emotions, and mind make up the total humanbeing, and unless they live together harmoniously, conflict is inevitable.Conflict makes for insensitivity. The mind may dominate the body and suppressthe senses, but it thereby makes the body insensitive; and an insensitive bodybecomes a hindrance to the full flight of the mind. The mortification of thebody is definitely not conducive to the seeking out of the deeper layers ofconsciousness; for this is possible only when the mind, the emotions, and thebody are not in contradiction with each other, but are integrated and in unison,effortlessly, without being driven by any concept, belief, or ideal.In the cultivation of the mind, our emphasis should not be on concentration, buton attention. Concentration is a process of forcing the mind to narrow down to apoint, whereas attention is without frontiers. In that process the mind isalways limited by a frontier or boundary, but when our concern is to understandthe totality of the mind, mere concentration becomes a hindrance. Attention islimitless, without the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge comes throughconcentration, and any extension of knowledge is still within its own frontiers.In the state of attention the mind can and does use knowledge, which ofnecessity is the result of concentration; but the part is never the whole, andadding together the many parts does not make for the perception of the whole.Knowledge, which is the additive process of concentration, does not bring aboutthe understanding of the immeasurable. The total is never within the brackets ofa concentrated mind.So attention is of primary importance, but it does not come through the effortof concentration. Attention is a state in which the mind is ever learningwithout a center around which knowledge gathers as accumulated experience. Amind that is concentrated upon itself uses knowledge as a means of its ownexpansion; and such activity becomes self-contradictory and antisocial.Learning in the true sense of the word is possible only in that state ofattention in which there is no outer or inner compulsion. Right thinking cancome about only when the mind is not enslaved by tradition and memory. It isattention that allows silence to come upon the mind, which is the opening of thedoor to creation. That is why attention is of the highest importance.Knowledge is necessary at the functional level as a means of cultivating themind, and not as an end in itself. We are concerned not with the development ofjust one capacity, such as that of a mathematician, or a scientist, or amusician, but with the total development of the student as a human being.How is the state of attention to be brought about? It cannot be cultivatedthrough persuasion, comparison, reward, or punishment, all of which are forms ofcoercion. The elimination of fear is the beginning of attention. Fear must existas long as there is an urge to be or to become, which is the pursuit of success,with all its frustrations and tortuous contradictions. You can teachconcentration, but attention cannot be taught, just as you cannot possibly teachfreedom from fear; but we can begin to discover the causes that produce fear,and in understanding these causes there is the elimination of fear. So attentionarises spontaneously when around the student there is an atmosphere ofwell-being, when he has the feeling of being secure, of being at ease, and isaware of the disinterested action that comes with love. Love does not compare,and so the envy and torture of becoming cease.The general discontent which all of us experience, whether young or old, soonfinds a way to satisfaction, and thus our minds are put to sleep. Discontent isawakened from time to time through suffering, but the mind again seeks agratifying solution. In this wheel of dissatisfaction and gratification the mindis caught, and the constant awakening through pain is part of our discontent.Discontent is the way of inquiry, but there can be no inquiry if the mind istethered to tradition, to ideals. Inquiry is the flame of attention.By discontent I mean that state in which the mind understands what is. theactual, and constantly inquires to discover further. Discontent is a movement togo beyond the limitations of what is; and if you find ways and means ofsmoothing or overcoming discontent, then you will accept the limitations ofself-centered activity and of the society in which you find yourself.Discontent is the flame which burns away the dross of satisfaction, but most ofus seek to dissipate it in various ways. Our discontent then becomes the pursuitof the more, the desire for a bigger house, a better car, and so on, all ofwhich are within the field of envy; and it is envy that sustains suchdiscontent. But I am talking of a discontent in which there is no envy, no greedfor “the more,” a discontent that is not sustained by any desire forsatisfaction. This discontent is an unpolluted state which exists in each one ofus, if it is not deadened through wrong education, through gratifying solutions,through ambition, or through the pursuit of an ideal. When we understand thenature of real discontent, we shall see that attention is part of this burningflame, which consumes the pettiness and leaves the mind free of the limitationsof self-enclosing pursuits and gratifications.So attention comes into being only when there is inquiry not based onself-advancement or gratification. This attention must be cultivated in thechild, right from the beginning. You will find that when there is love—whichexpresses itself through humility, courtesy, patience, gentleness—you arealready free of the barriers which insensitivity builds; and so you are helpingto bring about in the child this state of attention from a very tender age.Attention is not something to be learned, but you can help to awaken it in thestudent by not creating around him that sense of compulsion which produces aself-contradictory existence. Then his attention can be focused at any moment onany given subject, and it will not be the narrow concentration brought aboutthrough the compulsive urge of acquisition or achievement.A generation educated in this manner will be free of acquisitiveness and fear,the psychological inheritance of their parents and of the society in which theyare born; and because they are so educated, they will not depend on theinheritance of property. This matter of inheritance destroys real independenceand limits intelligence; for it breeds a false sense of security, giving aself-assurance which has no basis and creating a darkness of the mind in whichnothing new can flourish. But a generation educated in this totally differentmanner we have been considering will create a new society; for they will havethe capacity born of that intelligence which is not hedged about by fear.Since education is the responsibility of the parents as well as of the teachers,we must learn the art of working together, and this is possible only when eachone of us perceives what is true. It is perception of the truth that brings ustogether, and not opinion, belief, or theory. There is a vast difference betweenthe conceptual and the factual. The conceptual may bring us togethertemporarily, but there will again be separation if our working together is onlya matter of conviction. If the truth is seen by each one of us, there may bedisagreement in detail but there will be no urge to separate. It is the foolishwho break away over some detail. When the truth is seen by all, the detail cannever become an issue over which there is dissension.Most of us are used to working together along the lines of establishedauthority. We come together to work for a concept, or to advance an ideal, andthis requires conviction, persuasion, propaganda, and so on. Such workingtogether for a concept, for an ideal, is totally different from the cooperationwhich comes from seeing the truth and the necessity of putting that truth intoaction. Working under the stimulus of authority—whether it be the authority ofan ideal, or the authority of a person who represents that ideal—is not realcooperation. A central authority who knows a great deal, or who has a strongpersonality and is obsessed with certain ideas, may force or subtly persuadeothers to work with him for what he calls the ideal; but surely this is not theworking together of alert and vital individuals, whereas when each one of usunderstands for himself the truth of any issue, then our common understanding ofthat truth leads to action, and such action is cooperation. He who cooperatesbecause he sees the truth as the truth, the false as the false, and the truth inthe false, will also know when not to cooperate, which is equally important.If each one of us realizes the necessity of a fundamental revolution ineducation and perceives the truth of what we have been considering, then weshall work together without any form of persuasion. Persuasion exists only whensomeone takes a stand from which he is unwilling to move. When he is merelyconvinced of an idea or entrenched in an opinion, he brings about opposition,and then he or the other has to be persuaded, influenced, or induced to thinkdifferently. Such a situation will never arise when each one of us sees thetruth of the matter for himself. But if we do not see the truth and act on thebasis of merely verbal conviction or intellectual reasoning, then there is boundto be contention, agreement or disagreement, with all the associated distortionand useless effort.It is essential that we work together, and it is as if we were building a house.If some of us are building and others are tearing down, the house will obviouslynever be built. So we must individually be very clear that we really see andunderstand the necessity of bringing about the kind of education that willproduce a new generation capable of dealing with the issues of life as a whole,and not as isolated parts unrelated to the whole.To be able to work together in this really cooperative way, we must meet oftenand be alert not to get submerged in detail. Those of us who are seriouslydedicated to the bringing about of the right kind of education have theresponsibility not only of carrying out in action all that we have understood,but also of helping others to come to this understanding. Teaching is thenoblest profession—if it can be called a profession at all. It is an art thatrequires, not just intellectual attainments, but infinite patience and love. Tobe truly educated is to understand our relationship to all things—to money, toproperty, to people, to nature—in the vast field of our existence.Beauty is part of this understanding, but beauty is not merely a matter ofproportion, form, taste, and behavior. Beauty is that state in which the mindhas abandoned the center of self in the passion of simplicity. Simplicity has noend; and there can be simplicity only when there is an austerity which is notthe outcome of calculated discipline and self-denial. This austerity isself-abandonment, which love alone can bring about. When we have no love wecreate a civilization in which beauty of form is sought without the innervitality and austerity of simple self-abandonment. There is no self-abandonmentif there is an immolation of oneself in good works, in ideals, in beliefs. Theseactivities appear to be free of the self, but in reality the self is stillworking under the cover of different labels. Only the innocent mind can inquireinto the unknown. But the calculated innocence which may wear a loincloth or therobe of a monk is not that passion of self-abandonment from which come courtesy,gentleness, humility, patience—the expressions of love.Most of us know beauty only through that which has been created or puttogether—the beauty of a human form, or of a temple. We say a tree, or a house,or the widely curving river, is beautiful. And through comparison we know whatugliness is—at least we think we do. But is beauty comparable? Is beauty thatwhich has been made evident, manifest? We consider beautiful a particularpicture, poem, or face, because we already know what beauty is from what we havebeen taught, or from what we are familiar with and about which we have formed anopinion. But does not beauty cease with comparison? Is beauty merely afamiliarity with the known, or is it a state of being in which there may or maynot be the created form?We are always pursuing beauty and avoiding the ugly, and this seeking ofenrichment through the one and avoidance of the other must inevitably breedinsensitivity. Surely, to understand or to feel what beauty is, there must besensitivity to both the so-called beautiful and the so-called ugly. A feeling isnot beautiful or ugly, it is just a feeling. But we look at it through ourreligious and social conditioning and give it a label; we say it is a goodfeeling or a bad feeling, and so we distort or destroy it. When feeling is notgiven a label it remains intense, and it is this passionate intensity that isessential to the understanding of that which is neither ugliness nor manifestedbeauty. What has the greatest importance is sustained feeling, that passionwhich is not the mere lust of self-gratification; for it is this passion thatcreates beauty and, not being comparable, it has no opposite.In seeking to bring about a total development of the human being, we mustobviously take into full consideration the unconscious mind as well as theconscious. Merely to educate the conscious mind without understanding theunconscious brings self-contradiction into human lives, with all itsfrustrations and miseries. The hidden mind is far more vital than thesuperficial. Most educators are concerned only with giving information orknowledge to the superficial mind, preparing it to acquire a job and adjustitself to society. So the hidden mind is never touched. All that so-callededucation does is to superimpose a layer of knowledge and technique, and acertain capacity to adjust to environment.The hidden mind is far more potent than the superficial mind, howeverwell-educated and capable of adjustment; and it is not something verymysterious. The hidden or unconscious mind is the repository of racial memories.Religion, superstition, symbol, peculiar traditions of a particular race, theinfluence of literature both sacred and profane, aspirations, frustrations,mannerisms, and varieties of food—all these are rooted in the unconscious. Theopen and secret desires, with their motivations, hopes, and fears, their sorrowsand pleasures, and the beliefs which are sustained through the urge forsecurity, translating itself in various ways—these things also are contained inthe hidden mind, which not only has this extraordinary capacity to hold theresidual past, but also the capacity to influence the future. Intimations of allthis are given to the superficial mind through dreams and in various other wayswhen it is not wholly occupied with everyday events.The hidden mind is nothing sacred and nothing to be frightened of, nor does itdemand a specialist to expose it to the superficial mind. But because of thehidden mind’s enormous potency, the superficial mind cannot deal with it as itwould wish. The superficial mind is to a great extent impotent in relation toits own hidden part. However much it may try to dominate, shape, or control thehidden, because of its immediate social demands and pursuits, the superficialcan only scratch the surface of the hidden; and so there is a cleavage orcontradiction between the two. We try to bridge this chasm through discipline,through various practices, sanctions, and so on; but it cannot so be bridged.The conscious mind is occupied with the immediate, the limited present, whereasthe unconscious is under the weight of centuries, and cannot be stemmed orturned aside by an immediate necessity. The unconscious has the quality of deeptime, and the conscious mind, with its recent culture, cannot deal with itaccording to its passing urgencies. To eradicate self-contradiction, thesuperficial mind must understand this fact and be quiescent, which does not meangiving scope to the innumerable urges of the hidden. When there is no resistancebetween the open and the hidden, then the hidden, because it has the patience oftime, will not violate the immediate.The hidden, unexplored, and un-understood mind, with its superficial part whichhas been “educated,” comes into contact with the challenges and demands of theimmediate present. The superficial may respond to the challenge adequately; butbecause there is a contradiction between the superficial and the hidden, anyexperience of the superficial only increases the conflict between itself and thehidden. This brings about still further experience, again widening the chasmbetween the present and the past. The superficial mind, experiencing the outerwithout understanding the inner, the hidden, only produces deeper and widerconflict.Experience does not liberate or enrich the mind, as we generally think it does.As long as experience strengthens the experiencer, there must be conflict. Inhaving experiences, a conditioned mind only strengthens its conditioning, and soperpetuates contradiction and misery. Only for the mind that is capable ofunderstanding the total ways of itself can experiencing be a liberating factor.Once there is perception and understanding of the power and capacities of themany layers of the hidden, then the details can be looked into wisely andintelligently. What is important is the understanding of the hidden, and not themere education of the superficial mind to acquire knowledge, however necessary.This understanding of the hidden frees the total mind from conflict, and onlythen is there intelligence.We must awaken the full capacity of the superficial mind that lives in everydayactivity, and also understand the hidden. In understanding the hidden there is atotal living in which self-contradiction, with its alternating sorrow andhappiness, ceases. It is essential to be acquainted with the hidden mind andaware of its workings; but it is equally important not to be occupied with it orgive it undue significance. It is only when the mind understands the superficialand the hidden that it can go beyond its own limitations and discover that blisswhich is not of time."},{"pageContent":"FREEDOM FROM THE KNOWN [index_split_001.html#filepos4121]"},{"pageContent":"1 If you think it is important to know about yourself only because I or someoneelse has told you it is important, then I am afraid all communication between uscomes to an end. But if we agree that it is vital that we understand ourselvescompletely, then you and I have quite a different relationship, then we canexplore together with a happy, careful, and intelligent inquiry.I do not demand your faith; I am not setting myself up as an authority. I havenothing to teach you—no new philosophy, no new system, no new path to reality;there is no path to reality any more than to truth. All authority of any kind,especially in the field of thought and understanding, is the most destructive,evil thing. Leaders destroy the followers and followers destroy the leaders. Youhave to be your own teacher and your own disciple. You have to questioneverything that man has accepted as valuable, as necessary.If you do not follow somebody you feel very lonely. Be lonely then. Why are youfrightened of being alone? Because you are faced with yourself as you are andyou find that you are empty, dull, stupid, ugly, guilty, and anxious—a petty,shoddy, secondhand entity. Face the fact; look at it, do not run away from it.The moment you run away fear begins.In inquiring into ourselves we are not isolating ourselves from the rest of theworld. It is not an unhealthy process. Man throughout the world is caught up inthe same daily problems as ourselves, so in inquiring into ourselves we are notbeing in the least neurotic because there is no difference between theindividual and the collective. That is an actual fact. I have created the worldas I am. So don’t let us get lost in this battle between the part and the whole.I must become aware of the total field of my own self, which is theconsciousness of the individual and of society. It is only then, when the mindgoes beyond this individual and social consciousness, that I can become a lightto myself that never goes out.Now where do we begin to understand ourselves? Here am I, and how am I to studymyself, observe myself, see what is actually taking place inside myself? I canobserve myself only in relationship because all life is relationship. It is nouse sitting in a corner meditating about myself. I cannot exist by myself. Iexist only in relationship to people, things, and ideas, and in studying myrelationship to outward things and people, as well as to inward things, I beginto understand myself. Every other form of understanding is merely an abstractionand I cannot study myself in abstraction. I am not an abstract entity;therefore, I have to study myself in actuality—as I am, not as I wish to be.Understanding is not an intellectual process. Acquiring knowledge about yourselfand learning about yourself are two different things, for the knowledge youaccumulate about yourself is always of the past and a mind that is burdened withthe past is a sorrowful mind. Learning about yourself is not like learning alanguage or a technology or a science—then you obviously have to accumulate andremember; it would be absurd to begin all over again—but in the psychologicalfield, learning about yourself is always in the present and knowledge is alwaysin the past, and as most of us live in the past and are satisfied with the past,knowledge becomes extraordinarily important to us. That is why we worship theerudite, the clever, the cunning. But if you are learning all the time, learningevery minute, learning by watching and listening, learning by seeing and doing,then you will find that learning is a constant movement without the past.If you say you will learn gradually about yourself, adding more and more, littleby little, you are not studying yourself now as you are but through acquiredknowledge. Learning implies a great sensitivity. There is no sensitivity ifthere is an idea, which is of the past, dominating the present. Then the mind isno longer quick, pliable, alert. Most of us are not sensitive, even physically.We overeat, we do not bother about the right diet, we oversmoke and drink sothat our bodies become gross and insensitive; the quality of attention in theorganism itself is made dull. How can there be a very alert, sensitive, clearmind if the organism itself is dull and heavy? We may be sensitive about certainthings that touch us personally but to be completely sensitive to all theimplications of life demands that there be no separation between the organismand the psyche. It is a total movement.To understand anything you must live with it, you must observe it, you must knowall its content, its nature, its structure, its movement. Have you ever triedliving with yourself? If so, you will begin to see that your self is not astatic state, it is a fresh living thing. And to live with a living thing yourmind must also be alive. And it cannot be alive if it is caught in opinions,judgments, and values.In order to observe the movement of your own mind and heart, of your wholebeing, you must have a free mind, not a mind that agrees and disagrees, takingsides in an argument, disputing over mere words but rather, following with anintention to understand—a very difficult thing to do because most of us don’tknow how to look at, or listen to, our own being any more than we know how tolook at the beauty of a river or listen to the breeze among the trees.When we condemn or justify we cannot see clearly, nor can we when our minds areendlessly chattering; then we do not observe what is. we look only at theprojections we have made of ourselves. Each of us has an image of what we thinkwe are or what we should be, and that image, that picture, entirely prevents usfrom seeing ourselves as we actually are.It is one of the most difficult things in the world to look at anything simply.Because our minds are very complex we have lost the quality of simplicity. Idon’t mean simplicity in clothes or food, wearing only a loincloth or breaking arecord fasting or any of that immature nonsense the saints cultivate, but thesimplicity that can look directly at things without fear—that can look atourselves as we actually are without any distortion, to say when we lie we lie,not cover it up or run away from it.Also in order to understand ourselves we need a great deal of humility. If youstart by saying, “I know myself,” you have already stopped learning aboutyourself; or if you say, “There is nothing much to learn about myself because Iam just a bundle of memories, ideas, experiences, and traditions,” then you havealso stopped learning about yourself. The moment you have achieved anything youcease to have that quality of innocence and humility; the moment you have aconclusion or start examining from knowledge, you are finished, for then you aretranslating every living thing in terms of the old, whereas if you have nofoothold, if there is no certainty, no achievement, there is freedom—to look, toachieve. And when you look with freedom it is always new. A confident man is adead human being.But how can we be free to look and learn when our minds, from the moment we areborn to the moment we die, are shaped by a particular culture in the narrowpattern of the “me”? For centuries we have been conditioned by nationality,caste, class, tradition, religion, language, education, literature, art, custom,convention, propaganda of all kinds, economic pressure, the food we eat, theclimate we live in, our family, our friends, our experiences—every influence youcan think of—and, therefore, our responses to every problem are conditioned.Are you aware that you are conditioned? That is the first thing to ask yourself,not how to be free of your conditioning. You may never be free of it, and if yousay, “I must be free of it,” you may fall into another trap of another form ofconditioning. So are you aware that you are conditioned? Do you know that evenwhen you look at a tree and say, “That is an oak tree,” or “That is a banyantree,” the naming of the tree, which is botanical knowledge, has so conditionedyour mind that the word comes between you and actually seeing the tree? To comein contact with the tree you have to put your hand on it and the word will nothelp you to touch it.How do you know you are conditioned? What tells you? What tells you you arehungry?—not as a theory but the actual fact of hunger? In the same way, how doyou discover the actual fact that you are conditioned? Isn’t it by your reactionto a problem, a challenge? You respond to every challenge according to yourconditioning and your conditioning, being inadequate, will always reactinadequately.When you become aware of it, does this conditioning of race, religion, andculture bring a sense of imprisonment? Take only one form of conditioning,nationality, become seriously, completely aware of it and see whether you enjoyit or rebel against it, and if you rebel against it, whether you want to breakthrough all conditioning. If you are satisfied with your conditioning you willobviously do nothing about it, but if you are not satisfied, when you becomeaware of it you will realize that you never do anything without it. Never! And,therefore, you are always living in the past with the dead.You will be able to see for yourself how you are conditioned only when there isa conflict in the continuity of pleasure or the avoidance of pain. If everythingis perfectly happy around you, your wife loves you, you love her, you have anice house, nice children and plenty of money, then you are not aware of yourconditioning at all. But when there is a disturbance—when your wife looks atsomeone else or you lose your money or are threatened with war or any other painor anxiety—then you know you are conditioned. When you struggle against any kindof disturbance or defend yourself against any outer or inner threat, then youknow you are conditioned. And as most of us are disturbed most of the time,either superficially or deeply, that very disturbance indicates that we areconditioned. So long as the animal is petted he reacts nicely, but the moment heis antagonized the whole violence of his nature comes out.We are disturbed about life, politics, the economic situation, the horror, thebrutality, the sorrow in the world as well as in ourselves, and from that werealize how terribly narrowly conditioned we are. And what shall we do? Acceptthat disturbance and live with it as most of us do? Get used to it as one getsused to living with a backache? Put up with it?There is a tendency in all of us to put up with things, to get used to them, toblame them on circumstances. “Ah, if things were right I would be different,” wesay, or, “Give me the opportunity and I will fulfill myself,” or, “I am crushedby the injustice of it all,” always blaming our disturbances on others or on ourenvironment or on the economic situation.If one gets used to disturbance it means that one’s mind has become dull, justas one can get so used to beauty around one that one no longer notices it. Onegets indifferent, hard and callous, and one’s mind becomes duller and duller. Ifwe do not get used to it we try to escape from it by taking some kind of drug,joining a political group, shouting, writing, going to a football match or to atemple or church, or finding some other form of amusement.Why is it that we escape from actual facts? We are afraid of death—I am justtaking that as an example—and we invent all kinds of theories, hopes, beliefs,to disguise the fact of death, but the fact is still there. To understand a factwe must look at it, not run away from it. Most of us are afraid of living aswell as of dying. We are afraid for our family, afraid of public opinion, oflosing our job, our security, and hundreds of other things. The simple fact isthat we are afraid, not that we are afraid of this or that. Now why cannot weface that fact?You can face a fact only in the present and if you never allow it to be presentbecause you are always escaping from it, you can never face it, and because wehave cultivated a whole network of escapes we are caught in the habit of escape.Now, if you are at all sensitive, at all serious, you will not only be aware ofyour conditioning but you will also be aware of the dangers it results in, whatbrutality and hatred it leads to. Why, then, if you see the danger of yourconditioning, don’t you act? Is it because you are lazy, laziness being lack ofenergy? Yet you will not lack energy if you see an immediate physical dangerlike a snake in your path, or a precipice, or a fire. Why, then, don’t you actwhen you see the danger of your conditioning? If you saw the danger ofnationalism to your own security, wouldn’t you act?The answer is you don’t see. Through an intellectual process of analysis you maysee that nationalism leads to self-destruction but there is no emotional contentin that. Only when there is an emotional content do you become vital.If you see the danger of your conditioning merely as an intellectual concept,you will never do anything about it. In seeing a danger as a mere idea there isconflict between the idea and action and that conflict takes away your energy.It is only when you see the conditioning and the danger of it immediately, andas you would see a precipice, that you act. So seeing is acting.Most of us walk through life inattentively, reacting unthinkingly according tothe environment in which we have been brought up, and such reactions create onlyfurther bondage, further conditioning, but the moment you give your totalattention to your conditioning you will see that you are free from the pastcompletely, that it falls away from you naturally."},{"pageContent":"2 We said in a previous chapter [index_split_022.html#filepos268291] that joy wassomething entirely different from pleasure, so let us find out what is involvedin pleasure and whether it is at all possible to live in a world that does notcontain pleasure but a tremendous sense of joy, of bliss.We are all engaged in the pursuit of pleasure in some form orother—intellectual, sensuous or cultural pleasure, the pleasure of reforming,telling others what to do, of modifying the evils of society, of doing good—thepleasure of greater knowledge, greater physical satisfaction, greaterexperience, greater understanding of life, all the clever, cunning things of themind; and the ultimate pleasure is, of course, to have God.Pleasure is the structure of society. From childhood until death we aresecretly, cunningly, or obviously pursuing pleasure. So whatever our form ofpleasure is, I think we should be very clear about it because it is going toguide and shape our lives. It is, therefore, important for each one of us toinvestigate closely, hesitantly, and delicately this question of pleasure, forto find pleasure, and then nourish and sustain it, is a basic demand of life andwithout it existence becomes dull, stupid, lonely, and meaningless.You may ask why then should life not be guided by pleasure? For the very simplereason that pleasure must bring pain, frustration, sorrow and fear, and, out offear, violence. If you want to live that way, live that way. Most of the worlddoes anyway, but if you want to be free from sorrow you must understand thewhole structure of pleasure.To understand pleasure is not to deny it. We are not condemning it or saying itis right or wrong, but if we pursue it, let us do so with our eyes open, knowingthat a mind that is all the time seeking pleasure must inevitably find itsshadow, pain. They cannot be separated, although we run after pleasure and tryto avoid pain.Now, why is the mind always demanding pleasure? Why is it that we do noble andignoble things with the undercurrent of pleasure? Why is it we sacrifice andsuffer on the thin thread of pleasure? What is pleasure and how does it comeinto being? I wonder if any of you have asked yourself these questions andfollowed the answers to the very end?Pleasure comes into being through four stages—perception, sensation, contact,and desire. I see a beautiful motorcar, say; then I get a sensation, a reaction,from looking at it; then I touch it or imagine touching it, and then there isthe desire to own and show myself off in it. Or I see a lovely cloud, or amountain clear against the sky, or a leaf that has just come in springtime, or adeep valley full of loveliness and splendor, or a glorious sunset, or abeautiful face, intelligent, alive, not self-conscious and, therefore, no longerbeautiful. I look at these things with intense delight and as I observe themthere is no observer but only sheer beauty like love. For a moment I am absentwith all my problems, anxieties, and miseries—there is only that marvelousthing. I can look at it with joy and the next moment forget it, or else the mindsteps in, and then the problem begins; my mind thinks over what it has seen andthinks how beautiful it was; I tell myself I should like to see it again manytimes. Thought begins to compare, judge, and say “I must have it againtomorrow.” The continuity of an experience that has given delight for a secondis sustained by thought.It is the same with sexual desire or any other form of desire. There is nothingwrong with desire. To react is perfectly normal. If you stick a pin in me Ishall react unless I am paralyzed. But then thought steps in and chews over thedelight and turns it into pleasure. Thought wants to repeat the experience, andthe more you repeat, the more mechanical it becomes; the more you think aboutit, the more strength thought gives to pleasure. So thought creates and sustainspleasure through desire, and gives it continuity; and, therefore, the naturalreaction of desire to any beautiful thing is perverted by thought. Thought turnsit into a memory and memory is then nourished by thinking about it over and overagain.Of course, memory has a place at a certain level. In everyday life we could notfunction at all without it. In its own field it must be efficient, but there isa state of mind where it has very little place. A mind which is not crippled bymemory has real freedom.Have you ever noticed that when you respond to something totally, with all yourheart, there is very little memory? It is only when you do not respond to achallenge with your whole being that there is a conflict, a struggle, and thisbrings confusion and pleasure or pain. And the struggle breeds memory. Thatmemory is added to all the time by other memories and it is those memories whichrespond. Anything that is the result of memory is old and, therefore, neverfree. There is no such thing as freedom of thought. It is sheer nonsense.Thought is never new, for thought is the response of memory, experience,knowledge. Thought, because it is old, makes this thing which you have looked atwith delight and felt tremendously for the moment, old. From the old you derivepleasure, never from the new. There is no time in the new.So if you can look at all things without allowing pleasure to creep in—at aface, a bird, the color of a sari, the beauty of a sheet of water shimmering inthe sun, or anything that gives delight—if you can look at it without wantingthe experience to be repeated, then there will be no pain, no fear and,therefore, tremendous joy.It is the struggle to repeat and perpetuate pleasure which turns it into pain.Watch it in yourself. The very demand for the repetition of pleasure bringsabout pain, because it is not the same as it was yesterday. You struggle toachieve the same delight, not only to your aesthetic sense but the same inwardquality of the mind, and you are hurt and disappointed because it is denied toyou.Have you observed what happens to you when you are denied a little pleasure?When you don’t get what you want you become anxious, envious, hateful. Have younoticed when you have been denied the pleasure of drinking or smoking or sex orwhatever it is, have you noticed what battles you go through? And all that is aform of fear, isn’t it? You are afraid of not getting what you want or of losingwhat you have. When some particular faith or ideology which you have held foryears is shaken or torn away from you by logic or life, aren’t you afraid ofstanding alone? That belief has for years given you satisfaction and pleasure,and when it is taken away you are left stranded, empty, and the fear remainsuntil you find another form of pleasure, another belief.It seems to me so simple and because it is so simple we refuse to see itssimplicity. We like to complicate everything. When your wife turns away fromyou, aren’t you jealous? Aren’t you angry? Don’t you hate the man who hasattracted her? And what is all that but fear of losing something which has givenyou a great deal of pleasure, a companionship, a certain quality of assuranceand the satisfaction of possession?So if you understand that where there is a search for pleasure there must bepain, live that way if you want to, but don’t just slip into it. If you want toend pleasure, though, which is to end pain, you must be totally attentive to thewhole structure of pleasure, not cut it out as monks and sannyasis do, neverlooking at a woman because they think it is a sin and thereby destroying thevitality of their understanding—but seeing the whole meaning and significance ofpleasure. Then you will have tremendous joy in life. You cannot think about joy.Joy is an immediate thing and by thinking about it, you turn it into pleasure.Living in the present is the instant perception of beauty and the great delightin it without seeking pleasure from it."},{"pageContent":"3 Fear, pleasure, sorrow, thought, and violence are all interrelated. Most of ustake pleasure in violence, in disliking somebody, hating a particular race orgroup of people, having antagonistic feelings toward others. But in a state ofmind in which all violence has come to an end there is a joy that is verydifferent from the pleasure of violence, with its conflicts, hatreds, and fears.Can we go to the very root of violence and be free from it? Otherwise we shalllive everlastingly in battle with each other. If that is the way you want tolive—and apparently most people do—then carry on; if you say, “Well, I’m sorry,violence can never end,” then you and I have no means of communication, you haveblocked yourself; but if you say there might be a different way of living, thenwe shall be able to communicate with each other.So let us consider together, those of us who can communicate, whether it is atall possible totally to end every form of violence in ourselves and still livein this monstrously brutal world. I think it is possible. I don’t want to have abreath of hate, jealousy, anxiety, or fear in me. I want to live completely atpeace. Which doesn’t mean that I want to die. I want to live on this marvelousearth, so full, so rich, so beautiful. I want to look at the trees, flowers,rivers, meadows, women, boys and girls, and at the same time live completely atpeace with myself and with the world. What can I do?If we know how to look at violence, not only outwardly in society—the wars, theriots, the national antagonisms and class conflicts—but also in ourselves, thenperhaps we shall be able to go beyond it.Here is a very complex problem. For centuries upon centuries man has beenviolent; religions have tried to tame him throughout the world and none of themhave succeeded. So if we are going into the question we must, it seems to me, beat least very serious about it because it will lead us into quite a differentdomain, but if we want merely to play with the problem for intellectualentertainment we shall not get very far.You may feel that you yourself are very serious about the problem but that aslong as so many other people in the world are not serious and are not preparedto do anything about it, what is the good of your doing anything? I don’t carewhether they take it seriously or not. I take it seriously, that is enough. I amnot my brother’s keeper. I myself, as a human being, feel very strongly aboutthis question of violence and I will see to it that in myself I am not violent,but I cannot tell you or anybody else, “Don’t be violent.” It has nomeaning—unless you yourself want it. So if you yourself really want tounderstand this problem of violence let us continue on our journey ofexploration together.Is this problem of violence out there or here? Do you want to solve the problemin the outside world or are you questioning violence itself as it is in you? Ifyou are free of violence in yourself the question is, “How am I to live in aworld full of violence, acquisitiveness, greed, envy, brutality? Will I not bedestroyed?” That is the inevitable question which is invariably asked. When youask such a question it seems to me you are not actually living peacefully.If you live peacefully you will have no problem at all. You may be imprisonedbecause you refuse to join the army or shot because you refuse to fight—but thatis not a problem; you will be shot. It is extraordinarily important tounderstand this.We are trying to understand violence as a fact, not as an idea, as a fact whichexists in the human being, and the human being is myself. And to go into theproblem I must be completely vulnerable, open, to it. I must expose myself tomyself—not necessarily expose myself to you because you may not beinterested—but I must be in a state of mind that demands to see this thing rightto the end and at no point stops and says I will go no further.Now it must be obvious to me that I am a violent human being. I have experiencedviolence in anger, violence in my sexual demands, violence in hatred, creatingenmity, violence in jealousy, and so on. I have experienced it, I have known it,and I say to myself, “I want to understand this whole problem, not just onefragment of it expressed in war, but this aggression in man which also exists inthe animals and of which I am a part.”Violence is not merely killing another. It is violence when we use a sharp word,when we make a gesture to brush away a person, when we obey because there isfear. So violence isn’t merely organized butchery in the name of God, in thename of society or country. Violence is much more subtle, much deeper, and weare inquiring into the very depths of violence.When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, oranything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because youare separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself bybelief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who isseeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion,to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the totalunderstanding of mankind.Now, there are two primary schools of thought with regard to violence: one whichsays, “Violence is innate in man” and the other which says, “Violence is theresult of the social and cultural heritage in which man lives.” We are notconcerned with which school we belong to—it is of no importance. What isimportant is the fact that we are violent, not the reason for it.One of the most common expressions of violence is anger. When my wife or sisteris attacked I say I am righteously angry; when my country is attacked, my ideas,my principles, my way of life, I am righteously angry. I am also angry when myhabits are attacked or my petty little opinions. When you tread on my toes orinsult me I get angry, or if you run away with my wife and I get jealous, thatjealousy is called righteous because she is my property. And all this anger ismorally justified. But to kill for my country is also justified. So when we aretalking about anger, which is a part of violence, do we look at anger in termsof righteous and unrighteous anger according to our own inclinations andenvironmental drive, or do we see only anger? Is there righteous anger ever? Oris there only anger? There is no good influence or bad influence, onlyinfluence, but when you are influenced by something which doesn’t suit me I callit an evil influence. The moment you protect your family, your country, a bit ofcolored rag called a flag, a belief, an idea, a dogma, the thing that you demandor that you hold, that very protection indicates anger. So can you look at angerwithout any explanation or justification, without saying, “I must protect mygoods,” or “I was right to be angry,” or “How stupid of me to be angry”?Can you look at anger as if it were something by itself? Can you look at itcompletely objectively, which means neither defending it nor condemning it? Canyou? Can I look at you if I am antagonistic to you or if I am thinking what amarvelous person you are? I can see you only when I look at you with a certaincare in which neither of these things is involved. Now, can I look at anger inthe same way, which means that I am vulnerable to the problem, I do not resistit, I am watching this extraordinary phenomenon without any reaction to it?It is very difficult to look at anger dispassionately because it is a part ofme, but that is what I am trying to do. Here I am, a violent human being,whether I am black, brown, white, or purple. I am not concerned with whether Ihave inherited this violence or whether society has produced it in me; all I amconcerned with is whether it is at all possible to be free from it. To be freefrom violence means everything to me. It is more important to me than sex, food,position, for this thing is corrupting me. It is destroying me and destroyingthe world, and I want to understand it, I want to be beyond it. I feelresponsible for all this anger and violence in the world. I feel responsible—itisn’t just a lot of words—and I say to myself, “I can do something only if I ambeyond anger myself, beyond violence, beyond nationality.” And this feeling Ihave that I must understand the violence in myself brings tremendous vitalityand passion to find out.But to be beyond violence I cannot suppress it, I cannot deny it, I cannot say,“Well, it is a part of me and that’s that,” or “I don’t want it.” I have to lookat it, I have to study it, I must become very intimate with it and I cannotbecome intimate with it if I condemn it or justify it. We do condemn it, though;we do justify it. Therefore, I am saying, stop for the time being condemning itor justifying it.Now, if you want to stop violence, if you want to stop wars, how much vitality,how much of yourself, do you give to it? Isn’t it important to you that yourchildren are killed, that your sons go into the army where they are bullied andbutchered? Don’t you care? My God, if that doesn’t interest you, what does?Guarding your money? Having a good time? Taking drugs? Don’t you see that thisviolence in yourself is destroying your children? Or do you see it only as someabstraction?All right then, if you are interested, attend with all your heart and mind tofind out. Don’t just sit back and say, “Well, tell us all about it.” I point outto you that you cannot look at anger nor at violence with eyes that condemn orjustify, and that if this violence is not a burning problem to you, you cannotput those two things away. So first you have to learn; you have to learn how tolook at anger, how to look at your husband, your wife, your children; you haveto listen to the politician, you have to learn why you are not objective, whyyou condemn or justify. You have to learn that you condemn and justify becauseit is part of the social structure you live in, your conditioning as a German oran Indian or a Negro or an American or whatever you happen to have been born,with all the dulling of the mind that this conditioning results in. To learn, todiscover, something fundamental you must have the capacity to go deeply. If youhave a blunt instrument, a dull instrument, you cannot go deeply. So what we aredoing is sharpening the instrument, which is the mind—the mind which has beenmade dull by all this justifying and condemning. You can penetrate deeply onlyif your mind is as sharp as a needle and as strong as a diamond. It is no goodjust sitting back and asking, “How am I to get such a mind?” You have to want itas you want your next meal, and to have it you must see that what makes yourmind dull and stupid is this sense of invulnerability which has built wallsround itself and which is part of this condemnation and justification. If themind can be rid of that, then you can look, study, penetrate, and perhaps cometo a state that is totally aware of the whole problem.So let us come back to the central issue—is it possible to eradicate violence inourselves? It is a form of violence to say, “You haven’t changed, why haven’tyou?” I am not doing that. It doesn’t mean a thing to me to convince you ofanything. It is your life, not my life. The way you live is your affair. I amasking whether it is possible for a human being living psychologically in anysociety to clear violence from himself inwardly? If it is, the very process willproduce a different way of living in this world.Most of us have accepted violence as a way of life. Two dreadful wars havetaught us nothing except to build more and more barriers between human beings,that is, between you and me. But for those of us who want to be rid of violence,how is it to be done? I do not think anything is going to be achieved throughanalysis, either by ourselves or by a professional. We might be able to modifyourselves slightly, live a little more quietly, with a little more affection,but in itself it will not give total perception. But I must know how to analyze,which means that in the process of analysis my mind becomes extraordinarilysharp, and it is that quality of sharpness, of attention, of seriousness, whichwill give total perception. One hasn’t the eyes to see the whole thing at aglance; this clarity of the eye is possible only if one can see the details,then jump. Some of us, in order to rid ourselves of violence, have used aconcept, an ideal called nonviolence, and we think by having an ideal of theopposite to violence, nonviolence, we can get rid of the fact, the actual—but wecannot. We have had ideals without number, all the sacred books are full ofthem, yet we are still violent—so why not deal with violence itself and forgetthe word altogether?If you want to understand the actual you must give your whole attention, allyour energy, to it. That attention and energy are distracted when you create afictitious, ideal world. So can you completely banish the ideal? The man who isreally serious, with the urge to find out what truth is, what love is, has noconcept at all. He lives only in what is.To investigate the fact of your own anger you must pass no judgment on it, forthe moment you conceive of its opposite you condemn it and, therefore, youcannot see it as it is. When you say you dislike or hate someone that is a fact,although it sounds terrible. If you look at it, go into it completely, itceases, but if you say, “I must not hate; I must have love in my heart,” thenyou are living in a hypocritical world with double standards. To livecompletely, fully, in the moment is to live with what is, the actual, withoutany sense of condemnation or justification—then you understand it so totallythat you are finished with it. When you see clearly the problem is solved.But can you see the face of violence clearly—the face of violence not onlyoutside you but inside you, which means that you are totally free from violencebecause you have not admitted ideology through which to get rid of it? Thisrequires very deep meditation, not just a verbal agreement or disagreement. Youhave now read a series of statements but have you really understood? Yourconditioned mind, your way of life, the whole structure of the society in whichyou live, prevent you from looking at a fact and being entirely free from itimmediately. You say, “I will think about it; I will consider whether it ispossible to be free from violence or not. I will try to be free.” That is one ofthe most dreadful statements you can make, “I will try.” There is no trying, nodoing your best. Either you do it or you don’t do it. You are admitting timewhile the house is burning. The house is burning as a result of the violencethroughout the world and in yourself and you say, “Let me think about it. Whichideology is best to put out the fire?” When the house is on fire, do you argueabout the color of the hair of the man who brings the water?"},{"pageContent":"4 None of the agonies of suppression, nor the brutal discipline of conforming to apattern, has led to truth. To come upon truth the mind must be completely free,without a spot of distortion.But first let us ask ourselves if we really want to be free.When we talk of freedom are we talking of complete freedom or of freedom fromsome inconvenient or unpleasant or undesirable thing? We would like to be freefrom painful and ugly memories and unhappy experiences but keep our pleasurable,satisfying ideologies, formulas, and relationships. But to keep the one withoutthe other is impossible, for, as we have seen, pleasure is inseparable frompain.So it is for each one of us to decide whether or not we want to be completelyfree. If we say we do, then we must understand the nature and structure offreedom.Is it freedom when you are free from something—free from pain, free from somekind of anxiety? Or is freedom itself something entirely different? You can befree from jealousy, say, but isn’t that freedom a reaction and, therefore, notfreedom at all? You can be free from dogma very easily, by analyzing it, bykicking it out, but the motive for that freedom from dogma has its own reactionbecause the desire to be free from a dogma may be that it is no longerfashionable or convenient. Or you can be free from nationalism because youbelieve in internationalism or because you feel it is no longer economicallynecessary to cling to this silly nationalistic dogma with its flag and all thatrubbish. You can easily put that away. Or you may react against some spiritualor political leader who has promised you freedom as a result of discipline orrevolt. But has such rationalism, such logical conclusion, anything to do withfreedom?If you say you are free from something, it is a reaction which will then becomeanother reaction which will bring about another conformity, another form ofdomination. In this way you can have a chain of reactions and accept eachreaction as freedom. But it is not freedom; it is merely a continuity of amodified past, which the mind clings to.The youth of today, like all youth, are in revolt against society, and that is agood thing in itself, but revolt is not freedom because when you revolt it is areaction and that reaction sets up its own pattern and you get caught in thatpattern. You think it is something new. It is not; it is the old in a differentmold. Any social or political revolt will inevitably revert to the good oldbourgeois mentality.Freedom comes only when you see and act, never through revolt. The seeing is theacting and such action is as instantaneous as when you see danger. Then there isno cerebration, no discussion or hesitation; the danger itself compels the actand, therefore, to see is to act and to be free.Freedom is a state of mind—not freedom from something but a sense of freedom, afreedom to doubt and question everything and, therefore, so intense, active, andvigorous that it throws away every form of dependence, slavery, conformity, andacceptance. Such freedom implies being completely alone. But can the mindbrought up in a culture so dependent on environment and its own tendencies everfind that freedom which is complete solitude and in which there is noleadership, no tradition, and no authority?This solitude is an inward state of mind, which is not dependent on any stimulusor any knowledge and is not the result of any experience or conclusion. Most ofus, inwardly, are never alone. There is a difference between isolation, cuttingoneself off, and aloneness, solitude. We all know what it is to be isolated,building a wall around oneself in order never to be hurt, never to bevulnerable, or cultivating detachment, which is another form of agony, or livingin some dreamy ivory tower of ideology. Aloneness is something quite different.You are never alone because you are full of all the memories, all theconditioning, all the mutterings of yesterday; your mind is never clear of allthe rubbish it has accumulated. To be alone you must die to the past. When youare alone, totally alone, not belonging to any family, any nation, any culture,any particular continent, there is that sense of being an outsider. The man whois completely alone in this way is innocent and it is this innocence that freesthe mind from sorrow.We carry about with us the burden of what thousands of people have said and thememories of all our misfortunes. To abandon all that totally is to be alone, andthe mind that is alone is not only innocent but young—not in time or age, butyoung, innocent, alive at whatever age—and only such a mind can see that whichis truth and that which is not measurable by words.In this solitude you will begin to understand the necessity of living withyourself as you are, not as you think you should be or as you have been. See ifyou can look at yourself without any tremor, any false modesty, any fear, anyjustification, or condemnation—just live with yourself as you actually are. Itis only when you live with something intimately that you begin to understand it.But the moment you get used to it—get used to your own anxiety or envy orwhatever it is—you are no longer living with it. If you live by a river, after afew days you do not hear the sound of the water anymore, or if you have apicture in the room which you see every day you lose it after a week. It is thesame with the mountains, the valleys, the trees—the same with your family, yourhusband, your wife. But to live with something like jealousy, envy, or anxietyyou must never get used to it, never accept it. You must care for it as youwould care for a newly planted tree, protect it against the sun, against thestorm. You must care for it, not condemn it or justify it. Therefore, you beginto love it. When you care for it, you are beginning to love it. It is not thatyou love being envious or anxious, as so many people do, but rather that youcare for watching.So can you—can you and I—live with what we actually are, knowing ourselves to bedull, envious, fearful, believing we have tremendous affection when we have not,getting easily hurt, easily flattered, and bored—can we live with all that,neither accepting it nor denying it, but just observing it without becomingmorbid, depressed, or elated?Now let us ask ourselves a further question. Is this freedom, this solitude,this coming into contact with the whole structure of what we are in ourselves—isit to be come upon through time? That is, is freedom to be achieved through agradual process? Obviously not, because as soon as you introduce time you areenslaving yourself more and more. You cannot become free gradually. It is not amatter of time.The next question is, can you become conscious of that freedom?If you say, “I am free,” then you are not free. It is like a man saying, “I amhappy.” The moment he says, “I am happy,” he is living in a memory of somethingthat has gone. Freedom can only come about naturally, not through wishing,wanting, longing. Nor will you find it by creating an image of what you think itis. To come upon it the mind has to learn to look at life, which is a vastmovement, without the bondage of time, for freedom lies beyond the field ofconsciousness."},{"pageContent":"5 The demand to be safe in relationship inevitably breeds sorrow and fear. Thisseeking for security is inviting insecurity. Have you ever found security in anyof your relationships? Have you? Most of us want the security of loving andbeing loved, but is there love when each one of us is seeking his own security,his own particular path? We are not loved because we don’t know how to love.What is love? The word is so loaded and corrupted that I hardly like to use it.Everybody talks of love—every magazine and newspaper and every missionary talkseverlastingly of love. I love my country, I love my king, I love some book, Ilove that mountain, I love pleasure, I love my wife, I love God. Is love anidea? If it is, it can be cultivated, nourished, cherished, pushed around,twisted in any way you like. When you say you love God what does it mean? Itmeans that you love a projection of your own imagination, a projection ofyourself clothed in certain forms of respectability according to what you thinkis noble and holy; so to say, “I love God,” is absolute nonsense. When youworship God you are worshiping yourself—and that is not love.Because we cannot solve this human thing called love we run away intoabstractions. Love may be the ultimate solution to all man’s difficulties,problems, and travails, so how are we going to find out what love is? By merelydefining it? The church has defined it one way, society another and there areall sorts of deviations and perversions. Adoring someone, sleeping with someone,the emotional exchange, the companionship—is that what we mean by love? That hasbeen the norm, the pattern, and it has become so tremendously personal,sensuous, and limited that religions have declared that love is something muchmore than this. In what they call human love they see there is pleasure,competition, jealousy, the desire to possess, to hold, to control and tointerfere with another’s thinking, and knowing the complexity of all this theysay there must be another kind of love: divine, beautiful, untouched,uncorrupted.Throughout the world, so-called holy men have maintained that to look at a womanis something totally wrong: they say you cannot come near to God if you indulgein sex; therefore, they push it aside although they are eaten up with it. But bydenying sexuality they put out their eyes and cut out their tongues for theydeny the whole beauty of the earth. They have starved their hearts and minds;they are dehydrated human beings; they have banished beauty because beauty isassociated with woman.Can love be divided into the sacred and the profane, the human and the divine,or is there only love? Is love of the one and not of the many? If I say, “I loveyou,” does that exclude the love of the other? Is love personal or impersonal?Moral or immoral? Family or nonfamily? If you love mankind can you love theparticular? Is love sentiment? Is love emotion? Is love pleasure and desire? Allthese questions indicate, don’t they, that we have ideas about love, ideas aboutwhat it should or should not be, a pattern or a code developed by the culture inwhich we live.So to go into the question of what love is we must first free it from theencrustation of centuries, put away all ideals and ideologies of what it shouldor should not be. To divide anything into what should be and what is is the mostdeceptive way of dealing with life.Now how am I going to find out what this flame is which we call love—not how toexpress it to another but what it means in itself? I will first reject what thechurch, what society, what my parents and friends, what every person and everybook, has said about it because I want to find out for myself what it is. Hereis an enormous problem that involves the whole of mankind. There have been athousand ways of defining it and I myself am caught in some pattern or otheraccording to what I like or enjoy at the moment—so shouldn’t I, in order tounderstand it, first free myself from my own inclinations and prejudices? I amconfused, torn by my own desires, so I say to myself, “First clear up your ownconfusion. Perhaps you may be able to discover what love is through what it isnot.”The government says go and kill for the love of your country. Is that love?Religion says give up sex for the love of God. Is that love? Is love desire?Don’t say no. For most of us it is desire with pleasure, the pleasure that isderived through the senses, through sexual attachment and fulfillment. I am notagainst sex, but see what is involved in it. What sex gives you momentarily isthe total abandonment of yourself, then you are back again with your turmoil, soyou want a repetition over and over again of that state in which there is noworry, no problem, no self. You say you love your wife. In that love is involvedsexual pleasure, the pleasure of having someone in the house to look after yourchildren, to cook. You depend on her; she has given you her body, her emotions,her encouragement, a certain feeling of security and well-being. Then she turnsaway from you; she gets bored or goes off with someone else, and your wholeemotional balance is destroyed, and this disturbance, which you don’t like, iscalled jealousy. There is pain in it, anxiety, hate and violence. So what youare really saying is, “As long as you belong to me I love you but the moment youdon’t I begin to hate you. As long as I can rely on you to satisfy my demands,sexual and otherwise, I love you, but the moment you cease to supply what I wantI don’t like you.” So there is antagonism between you, there is separation, andwhen you feel separate from another there is no love. But if you can live withyour wife without thought creating all these contradictory states, these endlessquarrels in yourself, then perhaps—perhaps—you will know what love is. Then youare completely free and so is she, whereas if you depend on her for all yourpleasure you are a slave to her. So when one loves there must be freedom, notonly from the other person but from oneself.This belonging to another, being psychologically nourished by another, dependingon another—in all this there must always be anxiety, fear, jealousy, guilt; andso long as there is fear there is no love; a mind ridden with sorrow will neverknow what love is; sentimentality and emotionalism have nothing whatsoever to dowith love. And so love is not to do with pleasure and desire.Love is not the product of thought, which is the past. Thought cannot possiblycultivate love. Love is not hedged about and caught in jealousy, for jealousy isof the past. Love is always active, present. It is not “I will love” or “I haveloved.” If you know love you will not follow anybody. Love does not obey. Whenyou love there is neither respect nor disrespect.Don’t you know what it means really to love somebody, to love without hate,without jealousy, without anger, without wanting to interfere with what he isdoing or thinking, without condemning, without comparing—don’t you know what itmeans? Where there is love is there comparison? When you love someone with allyour heart, with all your mind, with all your body, with your entire being, isthere comparison? When you totally abandon yourself to that love there is notthe other.Does love have responsibility and duty, and will it use those words? When you dosomething out of duty is there any love in it? In duty there is no love. Thestructure of duty in which the human being is caught is destroying him. So longas you are compelled to do something because it is your duty you don’t love whatyou are doing. When there is love there is no duty and no responsibility.Most parents, unfortunately, think they are responsible for their children andtheir sense of responsibility takes the form of telling them what they should doand what they should not do, what they should become and what they should notbecome. The parents want their children to have a secure position in society.What they call responsibility is part of that respectability they worship; andit seems to me that where there is respectability there is no order; they areconcerned only with becoming a perfect bourgeois. When they prepare theirchildren to fit into society they are perpetuating war, conflict, and brutality.Do you call that care and love?Really to care is to care as you would for a tree or a plant, watering it,studying its needs, the best soil for it, looking after it with gentleness andtenderness—but when you prepare your children to fit into society you arepreparing them to be killed. If you loved your children you would have no war.When you lose someone you love you shed tears; are your tears for yourself orfor the one who is dead? Are you crying for yourself or for another? Have youever cried for another? Have you ever cried for your son who was killed on thebattlefield? You have cried, but do those tears come out of self-pity or haveyou cried because a human being has been killed? If you cry out of self-pityyour tears have no meaning because you are concerned about yourself. If you arecrying because you are bereft of one in whom you have invested a great deal ofaffection, it was not really affection. When you cry for your brother who dies,cry for him. It is very easy to cry for yourself because he is gone. Apparentlyyou are crying because your heart is touched, but it is not touched for him, itis only touched by self-pity and self-pity makes you hard, encloses you, makesyou dull and stupid.When you cry for yourself, is it love? Crying because you are lonely, becauseyou have been left, because you are no longer powerful—complaining of your lot,your environment—always you in tears? If you understand this, which means tocome in contact with it as directly as you would touch a tree or a pillar or ahand, then you will see that sorrow is self-created, sorrow is created bythought, sorrow is the outcome of time. I had my brother three years ago, now heis dead, now I am lonely, aching, there is no one to whom I can look for comfortor companionship, and it brings tears to my eyes.You can see all this happening inside yourself if you watch it. You can see itfully, completely, in one glance, not take analytical time over it. You can seein a moment the whole structure and nature of this shoddy little thing called“me,” my tears, my family, my nation, my belief, my religion—all that ugliness,it is all inside you. When you see it with your heart, not with your mind, whenyou see it from the very bottom of your heart, then you have the key that willend sorrow. Sorrow and love cannot go together, but in the Christian world theyhave idealized suffering, put it on a cross and worshiped it, implying that youcan never escape from suffering except through that one particular door, andthis is the whole structure of an exploiting religious society.So when you ask what love is, you may be too frightened to see the answer. Itmay mean complete upheaval; it may break up the family; you may discover thatyou do not love your wife or husband or children—do you?—you may have to shatterthe house you have built, you may never go back to the temple.But if you still want to find out, you will see that fear is not love,dependence is not love, jealousy is not love, possessiveness and domination arenot love, responsibility and duty are not love, self-pity is not love, the agonyof not being loved is not love, love is not the opposite of hate any more thanhumility is the opposite of vanity. So if you can eliminate all these, not byforcing them but by washing them away as the rain washes the dust of many daysfrom a leaf, then perhaps you will come upon this strange flower, which manalways hungers after.If you have not got love—not just in little drops but in abundance—if you arenot filled with it, the world will go to disaster. You know intellectually thatthe unity of mankind is essential and that love is the only way, but who isgoing to teach you how to love? Will any authority, any method, any system, tellyou how to love? If anyone tells you, it is not love. Can you say, “I willpractice love. I will sit down day after day and think about it. I will practicebeing kind and gentle and force myself to pay attention to others”? Do you meanto say that you can discipline yourself to love, exercise the will to love? Whenyou exercise discipline and will to love, love goes out of the window. Bypracticing some method or system of loving you may become extraordinarily cleveror more kindly or get into a state of nonviolence, but that has nothingwhatsoever to do with love.In this torn desert world there is no love because pleasure and desire play thegreatest roles, yet without love your daily life has no meaning. And you cannothave love if there is no beauty. Beauty is not something you see—not a beautifultree, a beautiful picture, a beautiful building, or a beautiful woman. There isbeauty only when your heart and mind know what love is. Without love and thatsense of beauty there is no virtue, and you know very well that, do what youwill—improve society, feed the poor—you will only be creating more mischief, forwithout love there is only ugliness and poverty in your own heart and mind. Butwhen there is love and beauty, whatever you do is right, whatever you do is inorder. If you know how to love, then you can do what you like because it willsolve all other problems.So we reach the point: Can the mind come upon love without discipline, withoutthought, without enforcement, without any book, any teacher or leader—come uponit as one comes upon a lovely sunset? It seems to me that one thing isabsolutely necessary and that is passion without motive—passion that is not theresult of some commitment or attachment, passion that is not lust. A man whodoes not know what passion is will never know love because love can come intobeing only when there is total self-abandonment.A mind that is seeking is not a passionate mind and to come upon love withoutseeking it is the only way to find it—to come upon it unknowingly and not as theresult of any effort or experience. Such a love, you will find, is not of time;such a love is both personal and impersonal, is both the one and the many. Likea flower that has perfume, you can smell it or pass it by. That flower is foreverybody and for the one who takes trouble to breathe it deeply and look at itwith delight. Whether one is very near in the garden or very far away, it is thesame to the flower because it is full of that perfume and, therefore, it issharing with everybody.Love is something that is new, fresh, alive. It has no yesterday and notomorrow. It is beyond the turmoil of thought. It is only the innocent mindwhich knows what love is, and the innocent mind can live in the world, which isnot innocent. To find this extraordinary thing which man has sought endlesslythrough sacrifice, through worship, through relationship, through sex, throughevery form of pleasure and pain, is only possible when thought comes tounderstand itself and comes naturally to an end. Then love has no opposite, thenlove has no conflict.You may ask, “If I find such a love, what happens to my wife, my children, myfamily? They must have security.” When you put such a question you have neverbeen outside the field of thought, the field of consciousness. When once youhave been outside that field you will never ask such a question because then youwill know what love is in which there is no thought and, therefore, no time. Youmay read this mesmerized and enchanted, but actually to go beyond thought andtime—which means going beyond sorrow—is to be aware that there is a differentdimension called love.But you don’t know how to come to this extraordinary fount, so what do you do?If you don’t know what to do, you do nothing, don’t you? Absolutely nothing.Then inwardly you are completely silent. Do you understand what that means? Itmeans that you are not seeking, not wanting, not pursuing; there is no center atall. Then there is love."},{"pageContent":"KRISHNAMURTI TO HIMSELF [index_split_001.html#filepos4273]"},{"pageContent":"FEBRUARY 25, 1983 There is a tree by the river and we have been watching it day after day forseveral weeks when the sun is about to rise. As the sun rises slowly over thehorizon, over the trees, this particular tree becomes all of a sudden golden.All the leaves are bright with life and as you watch it as the hours pass by,that tree whose name does not matter—what matters is that beautiful tree—anextraordinary quality seems to spread all over the land, over the river. And asthe sun rises a little higher the leaves begin to flutter, to dance. And eachhour seems to give to that tree a different quality. Before the sun rises it hasa somber feeling, quiet, far away, full of dignity. And as the day begins, theleaves with the light on them dance and give it that peculiar feeling that onehas of great beauty. By midday its shadow has deepened and you can sit thereprotected from the sun, never feeling lonely, with the tree as your companion.As you sit there, there is a relationship of deep abiding security and a freedomthat only trees can know.Toward the evening when the western skies are lit up by the setting sun, thetree gradually becomes somber, dark, closing in on itself. The sky has becomered, yellow, green, but the tree remains quiet, hidden, and is resting for thenight.If you establish a relationship with it then you have relationship with mankind.You are responsible then for that tree and for the trees of the world. But ifyou have no relationship with the living things on this earth you may losewhatever relationship you have with humanity, with human beings. We never lookdeeply into the quality of a tree; we never really touch it, feel its solidity,its rough bark, and hear the sound that is part of the tree. Not the sound ofwind through the leaves, not the breeze of a morning that flutters the leaves,but its own sound, the sound of the trunk and the silent sound of the roots. Youmust be extraordinarily sensitive to hear the sound. This sound is not the noiseof the world, not the noise of the chattering of the mind, not the vulgarity ofhuman quarrels and human warfare, but sound as part of the universe.It is odd that we have so little relationship with nature, with the insects andthe leaping frog and the owl that hoots among the hills calling for its mate. Wenever seem to have a feeling for all living things on the earth. If we couldestablish a deep abiding relationship with nature we would never kill an animalfor our appetite, we would never harm, vivisect, a monkey, a dog, a guinea pigfor our benefit. We would find other ways to heal our wounds, heal our bodies.But the healing of the mind is something totally different. That healinggradually takes place if you are with nature, with that orange on the tree, andthe blade of grass that pushes through the cement, and the hills covered,hidden, by the clouds.This is not sentiment or romantic imagination but a reality of a relationshipwith everything that lives and moves on the earth. Man has killed millions ofwhales and is still killing them. All that we derive from their slaughter can behad through other means. But apparently man loves to kill things—the fleetingdeer, the marvelous gazelle, and the great elephant. We love to kill each other.This killing of other human beings has never stopped throughout the history ofman’s life on this earth. If we could, and we must, establish a deep longabiding relationship with nature, with the actual trees, the bushes, theflowers, the grass, and the fast moving clouds, then we would never slaughteranother human being for any reason whatsoever. Organized murder is war, andthough we demonstrate against a particular war, nuclear, or any other kind ofwar, we have never demonstrated against war. We have never said that to killanother human being is the greatest sin on earth."},{"pageContent":"FEBRUARY 28, 1983 Flying at forty-one thousand feet from one continent to another you see nothingbut snow, miles of snow; all the mountains and the hills are covered with snow,and the rivers too are frozen. You see them wandering, meandering, all over theland. And far below, the distant farms are covered with ice and snow. It is along, tiresome flight of eleven hours. The passengers were chattering away.There was a couple behind one and they never stopped talking, never looked atthe glory of those marvelous hills and mountains, never looked at the otherpassengers. Apparently they were absorbed in their own thoughts, in their ownproblems, in their chatterings. And at last, after a tedious, calm flight, inthe dead of winter, you land at the town on the Pacific.After the noise and the bustle, you leave that ugly, sprawling, vulgar, shoutingcity and the endless shops selling almost all the same things. You leave allthat behind as you go round the coast highway of the blue Pacific, following theseashore, on a beautiful road, wandering through the hills, meeting the seaoften; and as you leave the Pacific behind and enter into the country, windingover various small hills, peaceful, quiet, full of that strange dignity of thecountry, you enter the valley. You have been there for the last sixty years, andeach time you are astonished to enter into this valley. It is quiet, almostuntouched by man. You enter into this valley, which is almost like a vast cup, anest. Then you leave the little village and climb to about fourteen hundredfeet, passing rows and rows of orange orchards and groves. The air is perfumedwith orange blossom. The whole valley is filled with that scent. And the smellof it is in your mind, in your heart, in your whole body. It is the mostextraordinary feeling of living in a perfume that will last for about threeweeks or more. And there is a quietness in the mountains, a dignity. And eachtime you look at those hills and the high mountain, which is over six thousandfeet, you are really surprised that such a country exists. Each time you come tothis quiet, peaceful valley there is a feeling of strange aloofness, of deepsilence and the vast spreading of slow time.Man is trying to spoil the valley but it has been preserved. And the mountainsthat morning were extraordinarily beautiful. You could almost touch them. Themajesty, the vast sense of permanency is there in them. And you enter quietlyinto the house where you have lived for over sixty years and the atmosphere, theair, is, if one can use that word, holy; you can feel it. You can almost touchit. As it has rained considerably, for it is the rainy season, all the hills andthe little folds of the mountain are green, flourishing, full—the earth issmiling with such delight, with some deep quiet understanding of its ownexistence.You have said over and over again that the mind, or if you prefer it, the brain,must be quiet, must empty itself of all the knowledge it has gathered, not onlyto be free but to comprehend something that is not of time or thought or of anyaction. You have said this in different ways in most of your talks and I findthis awfully difficult, not only to grasp the idea, the depth of it, but thefeeling of quiet emptiness, if I can use that word. I never could feel my wayinto it. I have tried various methods to end the chattering of the mind, theendless occupation with something or other, this very occupation creating itsproblems. And as one lives one is caught up in all this. This is our daily life,the tedium, the talk that goes on in a family, and if there isn’t talking thereis always the television or a book. The mind seems to demand that it should beoccupied, that it should move from one thing to another, from knowledge toknowledge, from action to action with the everlasting movement of thought.As we pointed out, thought cannot be stopped by determination, by a decision ofthe will, or the urgent pressing desire to enter into that quality of quiet,still emptiness.I find myself envious for something which I think, which I feel, to be true,which I would like to have, but it has always eluded me, it has always gonebeyond my grasp. I have come, as I have often come, to talk with you. Why in mydaily life, in my business life, is there not the stability, the endurance, ofthat quietness? Why isn’t this in my life? I have asked myself what am I to do.I also realize I cannot do much, or I can’t do anything at all about it. But itis there nagging. I can’t leave it alone. If only I could experience it once,then that very memory will nourish me, then that very remembrance will give asignificance to a really rather silly life. So I have come to inquire, to probeinto this matter: why does the mind—perhaps the word brain may be better—demandthat it should be occupied?‘"},{"pageContent":"MARCH 10, 1983 The other day as one was walking along a secluded wooded lane far from the noiseand the brutality and the vulgarity of civilization, right away from everythingthat was put together by man, there was a sense of great quietness, envelopingall things—serene, distant, and full of the sound of the earth. As you walkedalong quietly, not disturbing the things of the earth around you, the bushes,the trees, the crickets, and the birds, suddenly round a bend there were twosmall creatures quarreling with each other, fighting in their small way. One wastrying to drive off the other. The other was intruding, trying to get into theother’s little hole, and the owner was fighting it off. Presently the owner wonand the other ran off. Again there was quietness, a sense of deep solitude. Andas you looked up, the path climbed high into the mountains, the waterfall wasgently murmuring down the side of the path; there was great beauty and infinitedignity, not the dignity achieved by man that seems so vain and arrogant. Thelittle creature had identified itself with its home, as we human beings do. Weare always trying to identify ourselves with our race, with our culture, withthose things which we believe in, with some mystical figure, or some savior,some kind of super authority. Identifying with something seems to be the natureof man. Probably we have derived this feeling from that little animal.One wonders why this craving, longing, for identification exists. One canunderstand the identification with one’s physical needs, the necessarythings—clothes, food, shelter, and so on. But inwardly, inside the skin as itwere, we try to identify ourselves with the past, with tradition, with somefanciful romantic image, a symbol much cherished. And surely in thisidentification there is a sense of security, safety, a sense of being owned andof possessing. This gives great comfort. One takes comfort, security, in anyform of illusion. And man apparently needs many illusions.In the distance there is the hoot of an owl and there is a deep-throated replyfrom the other side of the valley. It is still dawn. The noise of the day hasnot begun and everything is quiet. There is something strange and holy where thesun arises. There is a prayer, a chant to the dawn, to that strange quiet light.That early morning, the light was subdued, there was no breeze and all thevegetation, the trees, the bushes, were quiet, still, waiting. Waiting for thesun to arise. And perhaps the sun would not come up for another half hour or so,and the dawn was slowly covering the earth with a strange stillness.Gradually, slowly, the topmost mountain was getting brighter and the sun wastouching it, golden, clear, and the snow was pure, untouched by the light ofday.As you climbed, leaving the little village paths down below, the noise of theearth—the crickets, the quails and other birds began their morning song, theirchant, their rich worship of the day. And as the sun arose you were part of thatlight and had left behind everything that thought had put together. Youcompletely forgot yourself. The psyche was empty of its struggles and its pains.And as you walked, climbed, there was no sense of separateness, no sense ofbeing even a human being.The morning mist was gathering slowly in the valley, and that mist was you,getting more and more thick, more and more into the fancy, the romance, theidiocy of one’s own life. And after a long period of time you came down. Therewas the murmur of the wind, insects, the calls of many birds. And as you camedown the mist was disappearing. There were streets, shops, and the glory of thedawn was fast fading away. And you began your daily routine, caught in the habitof work, the contentions between man and man, the divisions of identification,the division of ideologies, the preparations for wars, your own inward pain, andthe everlasting sorrow of man."},{"pageContent":"MARCH 18, 1983 At the bird feeder there were a dozen or more birds chirping away, pecking atthe grains, struggling, fighting each other, and when another big bird came theyall fluttered away. When the big bird left again they all came back, chattering,quarreling, chirping, making quite a lot of noise. Presently a cat went by andthere was a flurry, a screeching and a great to-do. The cat was chased away—itwas one of those wild cats, not a pet cat; there are a great many of those wildones around here of different sizes, shapes, and colors. At the feeder all daylong there were birds, little ones and big ones, and then a blue jay camescolding everybody, the whole universe, and chased the other birds away—orrather, they left when it came. They were very watchful for cats. And as theevening drew close all the birds went away and there was silence, quiet,peaceful. The cats came and went, but there were no birds.That morning the clouds were full of light and there was promise in the air ofmore rain. For the past few weeks it had been raining. There is an artificiallake and the waters were right to the top. All the green leaves and the shrubsand the tall trees were waiting for the sun, which hadn’t appeared bright as theCalifornian sun is; it had not shown its face for many a day.One wonders what is the future of mankind, the future of all those children yousee shouting, playing—such happy, gentle, nice faces—what is their future? Thefuture is what we are now. This has been so historically for many thousands ofyears—the living and dying, and all the travail of our lives. We don’t seem topay much attention to the future. You see on television endless entertainmentfrom morning until late in the night, except for one or two channels, but theyare very brief and not too serious. The children are entertained. Thecommercials all sustain the feeling that you are being entertained. And this ishappening practically all over the world. What will be the future of thesechildren? There is the entertainment of sport—thirty, forty thousand peoplewatching a few people in the arena and shouting themselves hoarse. And you alsogo and watch some ceremony being performed in a great cathedral, some ritual,and that too is a form of entertainment, only you call that holy, religious, butit is still an entertainment—a sentimental, romantic experience, a sensation ofreligiosity. Watching all this in different parts of the world, watching themind being occupied with amusement, entertainment, sport, one must inevitablyask, if one is in any way concerned: What is the future? More of the same indifferent forms? A variety of amusements?So you have to consider, if you are at all aware of what is happening to you,how the worlds of entertainment and sport are capturing your mind, shaping yourlife. Where is all this leading to? Or perhaps you are not concerned at all? Youprobably don’t care about tomorrow. Probably you haven’t given it thought, or,if you have, you may say it is too complex, too frightening, too dangerous tothink of the coming years—not of your particular old age but of the destiny, ifwe can use that word, the result, of our present way of life, filled with allkinds of romantic, emotional, sentimental feelings and pursuits, and the wholeworld of entertainment impinging on your mind. If you are at all aware of allthis, what is the future of mankind?As we said earlier, the future is what you are now. If there is no change, notsuperficial adaptations, superficial adjustments to any pattern—political,religious, or social—but the change that is far deeper, demanding yourattention, your care, your affection—if there is not a fundamental change, thenthe future is what we are doing every day of our life in the present. Change israther a difficult word. Change to what? Change to another pattern? To anotherconcept? To another political or religious system? Change from this to that?That is still within the realm, or within the field of what is. Change to thatis projected by thought, formulated by thought, materialistically determined.So one must inquire carefully into this word change. Is there a change if thereis a motive? Is there a change if there is a particular direction, a particularend, a conclusion that seems sane, rational? Or perhaps a better phrase is “theending of what is.” The ending, not the movement of what is to “what should be.”That is not change. But if the ending has a motive, a purpose, is a matter ofdecision, then it is merely a change from this to that. The word decisionimplies the action of will: “I will do this; I won’t do that.” When desireenters into the act of the ending, that desire becomes the cause of ending.Where there is a cause there is a motive and so there is no real ending at all.The twentieth century has had a tremendous lot of changes produced by twodevastating wars, and the dialectical materialism, and the skepticism ofreligious beliefs, activities, and rituals, and so on, apart from thetechnological world, which has brought about a great many changes, and therewill be further changes when the computer is fully developed—you are just at thebeginning of it. Then when the computer takes over, what is going to happen toour human minds? That is a different question, which we should go into anothertime.When the industry of entertainment takes over, as it is gradually doing now,when the young people, the students, the children, are constantly instigated topleasure, to fancy, to romantic sensuality, the words restraint and austerityare pushed away, never even given a thought. The austerity of the monks, thesannyasis. who deny the world, who clothe their bodies with some kind of uniformor just a cloth—this denial of the material world is surely not austerity. Youprobably won’t even listen to this, to what the implications of austerity are.When you have been brought up from childhood to amuse yourself and escape fromyourself through entertainment, religious or otherwise, and when most of thepsychologists say that you must express everything you feel and that any form ofholding back or restraint is detrimental, leading to various forms ofneuroticism, you naturally enter more and more into the world of sport,amusement, entertainment, all helping you to escape from yourself, from what youare.The understanding of the nature of what you are, without any distortions,without any bias, without any reactions to what you discover you are, is thebeginning of austerity. The watching, the awareness, of every thought, everyfeeling, not to restrain it, not to control it, but to watch it, like watching abird in flight, without any of your own prejudices and distortions—that watchingbrings about an extraordinary sense of austerity that goes beyond all restraint,all the fooling around with oneself and all this idea of self-improvement,self-fulfillment. That is all rather childish. In this watching there is greatfreedom and in that freedom there is the sense of the dignity of austerity. Butif you said all this to a modern group of students or children, they wouldprobably look out of the window in boredom because this world is bent on its ownpursuit of pleasure.A large, fawn-colored squirrel came down the tree and went up to the feeder,nibbled at a few grains, sat there on top of it, looked around with its largebeady eyes, its tail up, curved, a marvelous thing. It sat there for a moment orso, came down, went along the few rocks and then dashed to the tree and up anddisappeared.It appears that man has always escaped from himself, from what he is, from wherehe is going, from what all this is about—the universe, our daily life, the dyingand the beginning. It is strange that we never realize that however much we mayescape from ourselves, however much we may wander away—consciously,deliberately, or unconsciously, subtly—the conflict, the pleasure, the pain, thefear, and so on, are always there. They ultimately dominate. You may try tosuppress them, you may try to put them away deliberately with an act of will butthey surface again. And pleasure is one of the factors that predominates; it toohas the same conflicts, the same pain, the same boredom. The weariness ofpleasure and the fret are part of this turmoil of our life. You can’t escape it,my friend. You can’t escape from this deep unfathomed turmoil unless you reallygive thought to it, not only thought but see by careful attention, diligentwatching, the whole movement of thought and the self. You may say all this istoo tiresome, perhaps unnecessary. But if you do not pay attention to this, giveheed, the future is not only going to be more destructive, more intolerable, butwithout much significance. All this is not a dampening, depressing point ofview; it is actually so. What you are now is what you will be in the comingdays. You can’t avoid it. It is as definite as the sun rising and setting. Thisis the share of all man, of all humanity, unless we all change, each one of us,change to something that is not projected by thought."},{"pageContent":"MAY 9, 1983 You are already fairly high up, looking down into the valley, and if you climb amile or more up and up the winding path, passing all kinds of vegetation—liveoaks, sage, poison oak—and past a stream that is always dry in the summer, youcan see the blue sea far away in the distance, across range after range. Up hereit is absolutely quiet. It is so still there isn’t a breath of air. You lookdown and the mountains look down on you. You can go on climbing up the mountainfor many hours, down into another valley and up again. You have done it severaltimes before, twice reaching the very top of those rocky mountains. Beyond themto the north is a vast plain of desert. Down there it is very hot, here it isquite cold; you have to put something on in spite of the hot sun.And as you come down, looking at the various trees, plants, and little insects,suddenly you hear the rattle of a rattlesnake. And you jump, fortunately, awayfrom the rattler. You are only about ten feet away from it. It is stillrattling. You look at each other and watch. Snakes have no eyelids. This one wasnot very long but quite thick, as thick as your arm. You keep your distance andyou watch it very carefully, its pattern, its triangular head, and its blacktongue flickering in and out. You watch each other. It doesn’t move and youdon’t move. But presently, its head and its tail toward you, it slithers backand you step forward. Again it coils up and rattles and you watch each other.And again, with its head and tail toward you, it begins to go back and again youmove forward; and again it coils and rattles. You do this for several minutes,perhaps ten minutes or more; then it gets tired. You see that it is motionless,waiting, but as you approach it, it doesn’t rattle. It has temporarily lost itsenergy. You are quite close to it. Unlike the cobra which stands up to strike,this snake strikes lunging forward. But there was no movement. It was tooexhausted, so you leave it. It was really quite a poisonous, dangerous thing.Probably you could touch it but you are disinclined to, though not frightened.You feel that you would rather not touch it and you leave it alone.And as you come further down you almost step on a quail with about a dozen ormore babies. They scatter into the nearby bushes, and the mother too disappearsinto a bush and they all call to each other. You go down and wait, and if youhave the patience to watch, you presently see them all come together under themother’s wing. It is cool up there and they are waiting for the sun to warm theair and the earth.You come down across the little stream, past a meadow which is almost losing itsgreen, and return to your room rather tired but exhilarated by the walk and bythe morning sun. You see the orange trees with their bright yellow oranges, therose bushes and the myrtle, and the tall eucalyptus trees. It is all verypeaceful in the house.It was a pleasant morning, full of strange activities on the earth. All thoselittle things alive, rushing about, seeking their morning food—the squirrel, thegopher. They eat the tender roots of plants and are quite destructive. A dog cankill them so quickly with a snap. It is very dry, the rains are over and gone,to return again perhaps in four months or more. All the valley below is stillglistening. It is strange how there is a brooding silence over the whole earth.In spite of the noise of towns and the traffic, there is something almostpalpable, something holy. If you are in harmony with nature, with all the thingsaround you, then you are in harmony with all human beings. If you have lost yourrelationship with nature you will inevitably lose your relationship with humanbeings.A whole group of us sitting at table toward the end of the meal began a seriousconversation, as has happened several times before. It was about the meaning ofwords, the weight of the word, the content of the word, not merely thesuperficial meaning of the word but the depth of it, the quality of it, thefeeling of it. Of course the word is never the actual thing. The description,the explanation, is not that which is described, nor that about which there isan explanation. The word, the phrase, the explanation are not the actuality. Butthe word is used as a communication of one’s thought, one’s feeling, and theword, though it is not communicated to another, holds the feeling insideoneself. The actual never conditions the brain, but the theory, the conclusion,the description, the abstraction, do condition it. The table never conditionsthe brain but god does, whether it is the god of the Hindus, Christians, orMuslims. The concept, the image, conditions the brain, not that which isactually happening, taking place.To the Christian, the word Jesus or Christ has great significance, greatmeaning; it evokes a deep sentiment, a sensation. Those words have no meaning tothe Hindu, to the Buddhist, or to the Muslim. Those words are not the actual. Sothose words, which have been used for two thousand years, have conditioned thebrain. The Hindu has his own gods, his own divinities. Those divinities, likethe Christians’, are the projections of thought, out of fear, out of pleasure,and so on.It seems that language really doesn’t condition the brain; what does is thetheory of the language, the abstraction of a certain feeling and the abstractiontaking the form of an idea, a symbol, a person—not the actual person but aperson imagined, or hoped for, or projected by thought. All those abstractions,those ideas, conclusions, however strong, condition the brain. But the actual,like the table, never does.Take a word like suffering. That word has a different meaning for the Hindu andthe Christian. But suffering, however described by words, is shared by all ofus. Suffering is the fact, the actual. But when we try to escape from it throughsome theory, or through some idealized person, or through a symbol, those formsof escape mold the brain. Suffering as a fact doesn’t, and this is important torealize.Like the word attachment; to see the word, to hold it as if in your hand andwatch it, feel the depth of it, the whole content of it, the consequences of it,the fact that we are attached—the fact, not the word; that feeling doesn’t shapethe brain, put it into a mold, but the moment one moves away from it, that is,when thought moves away from the fact, that very movement away, movement ofescape, is not only a time factor, but the beginning of shaping the brain in acertain mold.To the Buddhist the word Buddha, the impression, the image, creates greatreverence, great feeling, devotion; he seeks refuge in the image which thoughthas created. And as the thought is limited, because all knowledge is alwayslimited, that very image brings about conflict—the feeling of reverence to aperson, or to a symbol, or to a certain long-established tradition—but thefeeling of reverence itself, divorced from all the external images, symbols, andso on, is not a factor of conditioning the brain.There, sitting in the next chair, was a modified Christian. And when across thetable one mentioned Christ one could immediately feel the restrictive,reverential reserve. That word has conditioned the brain. It is quiteextraordinary to watch this whole phenomenon of communication with words, eachrace giving different significance and meaning to the word and thereby creatinga division, a limitation, to the feeling which mankind suffers. The suffering ofmankind is common, is shared by all human beings. The Russian may express it inone way, the Hindu, the Christian in another, and so on, but the fact ofsuffering, the actual feeling of pain, grief, loneliness, that feeling nevershapes or conditions the brain. So one becomes very attentive to, aware of, thesubtleties of the word, the meaning, the weight of it.The universal, the global feeling of all human beings and theirinterrelationship, can only come into being when the words nation, tribe,religion, have all disappeared. Either the word has depth, significance, or noneat all. For most of us words have very little depth, they have lost theirweight. A river is not a particular river. The rivers of America or England orEurope or India are all rivers, but the moment there is identification through aword, there is division. And this division is an abstraction of the river, thequality of water, the depth of the water, the volume, the flow, the beauty ofthe river."},{"pageContent":"MAY 30, 1983 It has been raining here every day for over a month. When you come from aclimate like California where the rains stopped over a month ago, where thegreen fields were drying up and turning brown and the sun was very hot, it israther startling and surprising to see the green grass, the marvelous greentrees and the copper beeches, which are a spreading, light brown, becominggradually darker and darker. To see them now among the green trees is a delight.They are going to be very dark as the summer comes on. And this earth is verybeautiful. Earth, whether it is desert or filled with orchards and green, brightfields, is always beautiful.To go for a walk in the fields with the cattle and the young lambs, and in thewoods with the song of birds, without a single thought in your mind, onlywatching the earth, the trees, the sheep and hearing the cuckoo calling and thewood pigeons; to walk without any emotion, any sentiment, to watch the trees andall the earth—when you so watch, you learn your own thinking, are aware of yourown reactions and do not allow a single thought to escape you withoutunderstanding why it came, what was the cause of it. If you are watchful, neverletting a thought go by, then the brain becomes very quiet. Then you watch ingreat silence and that silence has immense depth, a lasting incorruptiblebeauty.The boy was good at games, really quite good. He was also good at his studies;he was serious. So one day he came to his teacher and said, “Sir, could I have atalk with you?” The educator said, “Yes, we can have a talk; let us go out for awalk.” So they had a dialogue. It was a conversation between the teacher and thetaught, a conversation in which there was some respect on both sides, and as theeducator was also serious, the conversation was pleasant, friendly, and they hadforgotten that he was a teacher with a student; the rank was forgotten, theimportance of one who knows, the authority, and the other who is curious.“Sir, I wonder if you know what all this is about, why I am getting aneducation, what part will it play when I grow up, what role have I in thisworld, why do I have to study, why do I have to marry and what is my future? Ofcourse, I realize I have to study and pass some sort of exams and I hope I willbe able to pass them. I will probably live for some years, perhaps fifty, sixty,or more, and in all those years to come what will be my life and the life ofthose people around me? What am I going to be and what is the point of theselong hours over books and hearing the teachers? There might be a devastatingwar; we might all be killed. If death is all that lies ahead, then what is thepoint of all this education? Please, I am asking these questions quite seriouslybecause I have heard the other teachers and you too pointing out many of thesethings.”“I would like to take one question at a time. You have asked many questions, youhave put several problems before me, so first let us look at perhaps the mostimportant question: What is the future of mankind and of yourself? As you know,your parents are fairly well-off and of course they want to help you in any waythey can. Perhaps if you get married they might give you a house, buy a housewith all the things necessary in it, and you might have a nice wife—might. Sowhat is it you are going to be? The usual mediocre person? Get a job, settledown with all the problems around you and in you—is that your future? Of coursea war may come, but it may not happen; let us hope it does not happen. Let ushope man may come to realize that wars of any kind will never solve any humanproblem. Men may improve, they may invent better airplanes, and so on, but warshave never solved human problems and they never will. So let us forget for themoment that all of us might be destroyed through the craziness of superpowers,through the craziness of terrorists, or some demagogue in some country wantingto destroy his invented enemies. Let us forget all that for the moment. Let usconsider what is your future, knowing that you are part of the rest of theworld. What is your future? As I asked, to be a mediocre person? Mediocritymeans to go half way up the hill, half way in anything, never going to the verytop of the mountain or demanding all your energy, your capacity, never demandingexcellence.“Of course you must realize also that there will be all the pressures fromoutside—pressures to do this, all the various narrow religious sectarianpressures and propaganda. Propaganda can never tell the truth; truth can neverbe propagated. So I hope you realize the pressure on you—pressure from yourparents, from your society, from the tradition to be a scientist, to be aphilosopher, to be a physicist, a man who undertakes research in any field; orto be a businessman. Realizing all this, which you must do at your age, what waywill you go? We have been talking about all these things for many terms, andprobably, if one may point out, you have applied your mind to all this. So as wehave some time together to go around the hill and come back, I am asking you,not as a teacher but with affection as a friend genuinely concerned, what isyour future? Even if you have already made up your mind to pass some exams andhave a career, a good profession, you still have to ask, is that all? Even ifyou do have a good profession, perhaps a life that is fairly pleasant, you willhave a lot of troubles, problems. If you have a family, what will be the futureof your children? This is a question that you have to answer yourself andperhaps we can talk about it. You have to consider the future of your children,not just your own future, and you have to consider the future of humanity,forgetting that you are German, French, English, or Indian. Let us talk aboutit, but please realize I am not telling you what you should do. Only foolsadvise, so I am not entering into that category. I am just questioning in afriendly manner, which I hope you realize; I am not pushing you, directing you,persuading you. What is your future? Will you mature rapidly or slowly,gracefully, sensitively? Will you be mediocre, though you may be first class inyour profession? You may excel, you may be very, very good at whatever you do,but I am talking of mediocrity of the mind, of the heart, mediocrity of yourentire being.”“Sir, I don’t really know how to answer these questions. I have not given toomuch thought to it, but when you ask this question, whether I am to become likethe rest of the world, mediocre, I certainly don’t want to be that. I alsorealize the attraction of the world. I also see that part of me wants all that.I want to have some fun, some happy times, but the other side of me also seesthe danger of all that, the difficulties, the urges, the temptations. So Ireally don’t know where I will end up. And also, as you pointed out on severaloccasions, I don’t know myself what I am. One thing is definite, I really don’twant to be a mediocre person with a small mind and heart, though with a brainthat may be extraordinarily clever. I may study books and acquire a great dealof knowledge, but I may still be a very limited, narrow person. Mediocrity, sir,is a very good word which you have used and when I look at it I am gettingfrightened—not of the word but of the whole implications of what you have shown.I really don’t know, and perhaps in talking it over with you it may clear thingsup. I can’t so easily talk with my parents. They probably have had the sameproblems as I have; they may be more mature physically but they may be in thesame position as I am. So if I may ask, sir, may I take another occasion, if youare willing, to talk with me? I really feel rather frightened, nervous,apprehensive of my capacity to meet all this, face it, go through it and notbecome a mediocre person.”It was one of those mornings that has never been before: the near meadow, thestill beeches, and the lane that goes into the deeper wood—all was silence.There wasn’t a bird chirping and the nearby horses were standing still. Amorning like this, fresh, tender, is a rare thing. There is peace in this partof the land and everything was very quiet. There was that feeling, that sense ofabsolute silence. It was not a romantic sentimentalism, not poetic imagination.It was and is. A simple thing is all this is. The cop-pet beeches this morningwere full of splendor against the green fields stretching to the distance, and acloud full of that morning light was floating lazily by. The sun was just comingup, there was great peace and a sense of adoration. Not the adoration of somegod or imaginative deity but a reverence that is born of great beauty. Thismorning one could let go of all the things one has gathered and be silent withthe woods and the trees and the quiet lawn. The sky was a pale and tender blueand far away across the fields a cuckoo was calling, the wood pigeons werecooing, and the blackbirds began their morning song. In the distance you couldhear a car going by. Probably when the heavens are so quiet with loveliness itwill rain later on. It always does when the early morning is very clear. Butthis morning it was all very special, something that has never been before andcould never be again.“I am glad you have come of your own accord, without being invited, and perhapsif you are prepared, we can continue with our conversation about mediocrity andthe future of your life. One can be excellent in one’s career; we aren’t sayingthat there is mediocrity in all professions; a good carpenter may not bemediocre in his work but in his daily, inward life, his life with his family, hemay be. We both understand the meaning of that word now and we shouldinvestigate together the depth of that word. We are talking about inwardmediocrity, psychological conflicts, problems and travail. There can be greatscientists who yet inwardly lead a mediocre life. So what is going to be yourlife? In some ways you are a clever student, but for what will you use yourbrain? We are not talking about your career, that will come later; what weshould be concerned about is the way you are going to live. Of course, you arenot going to be a criminal in the ordinary sense of that word. You are not, ifyou are wise, going to be a bully; they are too aggressive. You will probablyget an excellent job, do excellent work in whatever you choose to do. So let usput that aside for a moment; but inside, what is your life? Inwardly, what isthe future? Are you going to be like the rest of the world, always huntingpleasure, always troubled with a dozen psychological problems?”“At present, sir, I have no problems, except the problems of passingexaminations and the weariness of all that. Otherwise I seem to have noproblems. There is a certain freedom. I feel happy, young. When I see all theseold people I ask myself, am I going to end up like that? They seem to have hadgood careers or to have done something they wanted to do but in spite of thatthey become dreary, dull, and they seem never to have excelled in the deeperqualities of the brain. I certainly don’t want to be like that. It is notvanity, but I want to have something different. It is not an ambition. I want tohave a good career and all that business but I certainly in no way want to belike these old people who seem to have lost everything they like.”“You may not want to be like them but life is a very demanding and cruel thing.It won’t let you alone. You will have great pressure from society whether youlive here or in America or in any other part of the world. You will beconstantly urged to become like the rest, to become something of a hypocrite,say things you don’t really mean, and if you do marry that may raise problemstoo. You must understand that life is a very complex affair—not just pursuingwhat you want to do and being pigheaded about it. These young people want tobecome something—lawyers, engineers, politicians, and so on; there is the urge,the drive of, ambition for power, money. That is what those old people whom youtalk about have been through. They are worn out by constant conflict, by theirdesires. Look at it, look at the people around you. They are all in the sameboat. Some leave the boat and wander endlessly and die. Some seek some peacefulcorner of the earth and retire; some join a monastery, become monks of variouskinds, taking desperate vows. The vast majority, millions and millions, lead avery small life, their horizon is very limited. They have their sorrows, theirjoys, and they seem never to escape from them or understand them and go beyond.So again we ask each other, what is our future, specifically, what is yourfuture? Of course you are much too young to go into this question very deeply,for youth has nothing to do with the total comprehension of this question. Youmay be an agnostic; the young do not believe in anything, but as you grow olderthen you turn to some form of religious superstition, religious dogma, religiousconviction. Religion is not an opiate, but man has made religion in his ownimage, blind comfort and, therefore, security. He has made religion intosomething totally unintelligent and impracticable, not something that you canlive with. How old are you?”“I’m going to be nineteen, sir. My grandmother has left me something when I amtwenty-one and perhaps before I go to the university I can travel and lookaround. But I will always carry this question with me wherever I am, whatever myfuture. I may marry, probably I will, and have children, and so the greatquestion arises—what is their future? I am somewhat aware of what thepoliticians are doing throughout the world. It is an ugly business as far as Iam concerned, so I think I won’t be a politician. I’m pretty sure of that but Iwant a good job. I’d like to work with my hands and with my brain but thequestion will be how not to become a mediocre person like ninety-nine percent ofthe world. So, sir, what am I to do? Oh, yes, I am aware of churches and templesand all that; I am not attracted to them. I rather revolt against all that—thepriests and the hierarchy of authority, but how am I going to prevent myselfbecoming an ordinary, average, mediocre person?”“If I may suggest, never under any circumstances ask ‘how.’ When you use theword how you really want someone to tell you what to do, some guide, somesystem, somebody to lead you by the hand so that you lose your freedom, yourcapacity to observe, your own activities, your own thoughts, your own way oflife. When you ask ‘how’ you really become a secondhand human being; you loseintegrity and also the innate honesty to look at yourself, to be what you areand to go beyond and above what you are. Never, never ask the question ‘how.’ Weare talking psychologically, of course. You have to ask ‘how’ when you want toput a motor together or build a computer. You have to learn something about itfrom somebody. But to be psychologically free and original can only come aboutwhen you are aware of your own inward activities, watch what you are thinkingand never let one thought escape without observing the nature of it, the sourceof it. Observing, watching. One learns about oneself much more by watching thanfrom books or from some psychologist or complicated, clever, erudite scholar orprofessor.“It is going to be very difficult, my friend. It can tear you in manydirections. There are a great many so-called temptations—biological, social—andyou can be torn apart by the cruelty of society. Of course, you are going tohave to stand alone but that can come about not through force, determination, ordesire but when you begin to see the false things around you and in yourself:the emotions, the hopes. When you begin to see that which is false, then thereis the beginning of awareness, of intelligence. You have to be a light toyourself and it is one of the most difficult things in life.”“Sir, you have made it all seem so very difficult, so very complex, so veryawesome, frightening.”“I am just pointing all this out to you. It doesn’t mean that facts needfrighten you. Facts are there to observe. It you observe them they neverfrighten you. Facts are not frightening. But if you want to avoid them, turnyour back and run, then that is frightening. To stand, to see that what you havedone may not have been totally correct, to live with the fact and not interpretthe fact according to your pleasure or form of reaction, that is notfrightening. Life isn’t very simple. One can live simply but life itself isvast, complex. It extends from horizon to horizon. You can live with few clothesor with one meal a day, but that is not simplicity. So be simple, don’t live ina complicated way, contradictory, and so on, just be simple inwardly. You playedtennis this morning. I was watching and you seem to be quite good at it. Perhapswe will meet again. That is up to you.”“Thank you, sir.”"},{"pageContent":"KRISHNAMURTI’S JOURNAL [index_split_001.html#filepos4426]"},{"pageContent":"SEPTEMBER 15, 1973 It is good to be alone. To be far away from the world and yet walk its streetsis to be alone. To be alone walking up the path beside the rushing, noisymountain stream full of spring water and melting snows is to be aware of thatsolitary tree, alone in its beauty. The loneliness of a man in the street is thepain of life; he’s never alone, far away, untouched and vulnerable. To be fullof knowledge breeds endless misery. The demand for expression, with itsfrustrations and pains, is that man who walks the streets; he is never alone.Sorrow is the movement of that loneliness.That mountain stream was full and high with the melting snows and the rains ofearly spring. You could hear big boulders being pushed around by the force ofonrushing waters. A tall pine of fifty years or more crashed into the water; theroad was being washed away. The stream was muddy, slate-colored. The fieldsabove it were full of wild flowers. The air was pure and there was enchantment.On the high hills there was still snow, and the glaciers and the great peaksstill held the recent snows; they will still be white all the summer long.It was a marvelous morning and you could have walked on endlessly, never feelingthe steep hills. There was a perfume in the air, clear and strong. There was noone on that path, coming down or going up. You were alone with those dark pinesand the rushing waters. The sky was that astonishing blue that only themountains have. You looked at it through leaves and the straight pines. Therewas no one to talk to and there was no chattering of the mind. A magpie, whiteand black, flew by, disappearing into the woods. The path led away from thenoisy stream and the silence was absolute. It wasn’t the silence after thenoise; it wasn’t the silence that comes with the setting of the sun, nor thatsilence when the mind dies down. It wasn’t the silence of museums and churchesbut something totally unrelated to time and space. It wasn’t the silence thatmind makes for itself. The sun was hot and the shadows were pleasant.He only discovered recently that there was not a single thought during theselong walks, in the crowded streets or on the solitary paths. Ever since he was aboy it had been like that, no thought entered his mind. He was watching andlistening and nothing else. Thought, with its associations, never arose. Therewas no image-making. One day he was suddenly aware how extraordinary it was; heattempted often to think but no thought would come. On these walks, with peopleor without them, any movement of thought was absent. This is to be alone.Over the snow peaks clouds were forming, heavy and dark; probably it would rainlater on but now the shadows were very sharp with the sun bright and clear.There was still that pleasant smell in the air and the rains would bring adifferent smell. It was a long way down to the chalet."},{"pageContent":"SEPTEMBER 17, 1973 That evening, walking through the wood there was a feeling of menace. The sunwas just setting and the palm trees were solitary against the golden westernsky. The monkeys were in the banyan tree, getting ready for the night. Hardlyanyone used that path and rarely you met another human being. There were manydeer, shy and disappearing into the thick growth. Yet the menace was there,heavy and pervading: it was all around you, you looked over your shoulder. Therewere no dangerous animals; they had moved away from there; it was too close tothe spreading town. One was glad to leave and walk back through the lightedstreets. But the next evening the monkeys were still there and so were the deerand the sun was just behind the tallest trees; the menace was gone. On thecontrary, the trees, the bushes and the small plants welcomed you. You wereamong your friends, you felt completely safe and most welcome. The woodsaccepted you and every evening it was a pleasure to walk there.Forests are different. There’s physical danger there, not only from snakes butfrom tigers that were known to be there. As one walked there one afternoon therewas suddenly an abnormal silence; the birds stopped chattering, the monkeys wereabsolutely still and everything seemed to be holding its breath. One stoodstill. And, as suddenly, everything came to life; the monkeys were playing andteasing each other, birds began their evening chatter, and one was aware thedanger had passed.In the woods and groves where man kills rabbits, pheasants, squirrels, there’squite a different atmosphere. You are entering into a world where man has been,with his gun and peculiar violence. Then the woods lose their tenderness, theirwelcome, and here some beauty has been lost and that happy whisper has gone.You have only one head and look after it, for it’s a marvelous thing. Nomachinery, no electronic computers can compare with it. It’s so vast, socomplex, so utterly capable, subtle, and productive. It’s the storehouse ofexperience, knowledge, memory. All thought springs from it. What it has puttogether is quite incredible: the mischief, the confusion, the sorrows, thewars, the corruptions, the illusions, the ideals, the pain and misery, the greatcathedrals, the lovely mosques, and the sacred temples. It is fantastic what ithas done and what it can do. But one thing it apparently cannot do: changecompletely its behavior in its relationship to another head, to another man.Neither punishment nor reward seem to change its behavior; knowledge doesn’tseem to transform its conduct. The me and the you remain. It never realizes thatthe me is the you, that the observer is the observed. Its love is itsdegeneration; its pleasure is its agony; the gods of its ideals are itsdestroyers. Its freedom is its own prison; it is educated to live in thisprison, only making it more comfortable, more pleasurable. You have only onehead, care for it, don’t destroy it. It’s so easy to poison it.He always had this strange lack of distance between himself and the trees,rivers, and mountains. It wasn’t cultivated: you can’t cultivate a thing likethat. There was never a wall between him and another. What they did to him, whatthey said to him never seemed to wound him, nor flattery to touch him. Somehowhe was altogether untouched. He was not withdrawn, aloof, but like the waters ofa river. He had so few thoughts; no thoughts at all when he was alone. His brainwas active when talking or writing but otherwise it was quiet and active withoutmovement. Movement is time and activity is not.This strange activity, without direction, seems to go on, sleeping or waking. Hewakes up often with that activity of meditation; something of this nature isgoing on most of the time. He never rejected it or invited it. The other nighthe woke up, wide awake. He was aware that something like a ball of fire, light,was being put into his head, into the very center of it. He watched itobjectively for a considerable time, as though it were happening to someoneelse. It was not an illusion, something conjured up by the mind. Dawn was comingand through the opening of the curtains he could see the trees."},{"pageContent":"SEPTEMBER 20, 1973 The river was particularly beautiful this morning; the sun was just coming overthe trees and the village hidden among them. The air was very still and therewas not a ripple on the water. It would get quite warm during the day but now itwas rather cool and a solitary monkey was sitting in the sun. It was alwaysthere by itself, big and heavy. During the day it disappeared and turned upearly in the morning on the top of the tamarind tree: when it got warm the treeseemed to swallow it. The golden green flycatchers were sitting on the parapetwith the doves, and the vultures were still on the top branches of anothertamarind. There was immense quietness and one sat on a bench, lost to the world.Coming back from the airport on a shaded road with the parrots, green and red,screeching around the trees, one saw across the road what appeared to be a largebundle. As the car came near, the bundle turned out to be a man lying across theroad, almost naked. The car stopped and we got out. His body was large and hishead very small; he was staring through the leaves at the astonishingly bluesky. We looked up too to see what he was staring at and the sky from the roadwas really blue and the leaves were really green. He was malformed and they saidhe was one of the village idiots. He never moved and the car had to be drivenround him very carefully. The camels with their load and the shouting childrenpassed him without paying the least attention. A dog passed, making a widecircle. The parrots were busy with their noise. The dry fields, the villagers,the trees, the yellow flowers were occupied with their own existence. That partof the world was underdeveloped and there was no one or organization to lookafter such people. There were open gutters, filth and crowding humanity, and thesacred river went on its way. The sadness of life was everywhere, and in theblue sky, high in the air, were the heavy-winged vultures, circling withoutmoving their wings, circling by the hour, waiting and watching.What is sanity and insanity? Who is sane and who is insane? Are the politicianssane? The priests, are they insane? Those who are committed to ideologies, arethey sane? We are controlled, shaped, pushed around by them, and are we sane?What is sanity? To be whole, nonfragmented in action, in life, in every kind ofrelationship, that is the very essence of sanity. Sanity means to be whole,healthy and holy. To be insane, neurotic, psychotic, unbalanced, schizophrenic,whatever name you might give to it, is to be fragmented, broken up in action andin the movement of relationship, which is existence. To breed antagonism anddivision, which is the trade of the politicians who represent you, is tocultivate and sustain insanity, whether they are dictators or those in power inthe name of peace or some form of ideology. And the priest: look at the world ofthe priesthood. He stands between you and what he and you consider truth,savior, God, heaven, hell. He is the interpreter, the representative; he holdsthe keys to heaven; he has conditioned man through belief, dogma, and ritual; heis the real propagandist. He has conditioned you because you want comfort,security, and you dread tomorrow. The artists, the intellectuals, thescientists, admired and flattered so much—are they sane? Or do they live in twodifferent worlds—the world of ideas and imagination with its compulsiveexpression, wholly separate from their daily life of sorrow and pleasure?The world about you is fragmented and so are you and its expression is conflict,confusion, and misery: you are the world and the world is you. Sanity is to livea life of action without conflict. Action and idea are contradictory. Seeing isthe doing and not ideation first and action according to the conclusion. Thisbreeds conflict. The analyzer himself is the analyzed. When the analyzerseparates himself as something different from the analyzed, he begets conflict,and conflict is the area of the unbalanced. The observer is the observed andtherein lies sanity, the whole, and with the holy is love."},{"pageContent":"SEPTEMBER 27, 1973 It was a temple in ruins, with its roofless long corridors, gates, headlessstatues, and deserted courtyards. It had become a sanctuary for birds andmonkeys, parrots and doves. Some of the headless statues were still massive intheir beauty; they had a still dignity. The whole place was surprisingly cleanand one could sit on the ground to watch the monkeys and chattering birds. Once,very long ago, the temple must have been a flourishing place with thousands ofworshipers, with garlands, incense, and prayer. Their atmosphere was stillthere, their hopes, fears, and their reverence. The holy sanctuary was gone longago. Now the monkeys disappeared as it was growing hot, but the parrots anddoves had their nests in the holes and crevices of the high walls. This oldruined temple was too far away for the villagers to further destroy it. Had theycome they would have desecrated the emptiness.Religion has become superstition and image-worship, belief and ritual. It haslost the beauty of truth; incense has taken the place of reality. Instead ofdirect perception there is in its place the image carved by the hand or themind. The only concern of religion is the total transformation of man. And allthe circus that goes on around it is nonsense. That’s why the truth is not to befound in any temple, church, or mosque, however beautiful they are. Beauty oftruth and the beauty of stone are two different things. One opens the door tothe immeasurable and the other to the imprisonment of man; the one to freedomand the other to the bondage of thought. Romanticism and sentimentality deny thevery nature of religion, nor is it a plaything of the intellect. Knowledge inthe area of action is necessary to function efficiently and objectively, butknowledge is not the means of the transformation of man; knowledge is thestructure of thought and thought is the dull repetition of the known, howevermodified and enlarged. There is no freedom through the ways of thought, theknown.The long snake lay very still along the dry ridge of the rice fields, lusciouslygreen and bright in the morning sun. Probably it was resting or waiting for somecareless frog. Frogs were being shipped then to Europe to be eaten as adelicacy. The snake was long and yellowish, and very still; it was almost thecolor of the dry earth, hard to see, but the light of day was in its dark eyes.The only thing that was moving, in and out, was its black tongue. It could nothave been aware of the watcher who was somewhat behind its head. Death waseverywhere that morning. You could hear it in the village; the great sobs as thebody, wrapped in a cloth, was being carried out; a kite was streaking down on abird; some animal was being killed; you heard its agonizing cries. So it went onday after day: death is always everywhere, as sorrow is.The beauty of truth and its subtleties are not in belief and dogma, they neverare where man can find them for there is no path to its beauty; it is not afixed point, a haven of shelter. It has its own tenderness, whose love is not tobe measured; nor can you hold it, experience it. It has no market value to beused and put aside. It is there when the mind and heart are empty of the thingsof thought. The monk or the poor man are not near it, nor the rich; neither theintellectual nor the gifted can touch it. The one who says he knows has nevercome near it. Be far away from the world and yet live it.The parrots were screeching and fluttering around the tamarind tree thatmorning; they begin early their restless activity, with their coming and going.They were bright streaks of green with strong, red, curved beaks. They neverseemed to fly straight but always zigzagging, shrieking as they flew.Occasionally they would come to sit on the parapet of the veranda; then youcould watch them, but not for long; they would be off again with their crazy andnoisy flight. Their only enemy seemed to be man. He puts them in a cage."},{"pageContent":"OCTOBER 4, 1973 As a young boy, he used to sit by himself under a large tree near a pond inwhich lotuses grew; they were pink and had a strong smell. [Krishnamurti isdescribing his own childhood.] From the shade of that spacious tree, he wouldwatch the thin, green snakes and the chameleons, the frogs and the water snakes.His brother, with others, would come to take him home. It was a pleasant placeunder the tree, with the river and the pond. There seemed to be so much space,and in this the tree made its own space. Everything needs space. All those birdson telegraph wires, sitting so equally spaced on a quiet evening, make the spacefor the heavens.The two brothers would sit with many others in the room with pictures; therewould be a chant in Sanskrit and then complete silence; it was the eveningmeditation. The younger brother would go to sleep and roll over and wake up onlywhen the others got up to leave. The room was not too large and within its wallswere the pictures, the images of the sacred. Within the narrow confines of atemple or church, man gives form to the vast movement of space. It is like thiseverywhere; in the mosque it is held in the graceful lines of words. Love needsgreat space.To that pond would come snakes and occasionally people; it had stone stepsleading down to the water where grew the lotus. The space that thought createsis measurable and so is limited; cultures and religions are its product. But themind is filled with thought and is made up of thought; its consciousness is thestructure of thought, having little space within it. But this space is themovement of time, from here to there, from its center toward its outer lines ofconsciousness, narrow or expanding. The space which the center makes for itselfis its own prison. Its relationships are from this narrow space but there mustbe space to live; that of the mind denies living. Living within the narrowconfines of the center is strife, pain, and sorrow and that is not living.The space, the distance between you and the tree, is the word, knowledge, whichis time. Time is the observer who makes the distance between himself and thetrees, between himself and what is. Without the observer, distance ceases.Identification with the trees, with another or with a formula, is the action ofthought in its desire for protection, security. Distance is from one point toanother and to reach that point time is necessary; distance only exists wherethere is direction, inward or outward. The observer makes a separation, adistance between himself and what is; from this grows conflict and sorrow. Thetransformation of what is takes place only when there is no separation, no time,between the seer and the seen. Love has no distance.The brother died and there was no movement in any direction away from sorrow.This nonmovement is the ending of time. It was among the hills and green shadowsthat the river began and with a roar it entered the sea and the endlesshorizons. Man lives in boxes with drawers, acres of them, and they have nospace; they are violent, brutal, aggressive, and mischievous; they separate anddestroy each other. The river is the earth and the earth is the river; eachcannot exist without the other.There are no ends to words but communication is verbal and nonverbal. Thehearing of the word is one thing and the hearing of no word is another; the oneis irrelevant, superficial, leading to inaction; the other is nonfragmentaryaction, the flowering of goodness. Words have given beautiful walls but nospace. Remembrance, imagination, are the pain of pleasure, and love is notpleasure.The long, thin, green snake was there that morning; it was delicate and almostlost among the green leaves; it would be there, motionless, waiting andwatching. The large head of the chameleon was showing; it lay along a branch; itchanged its colors quite often."},{"pageContent":"APRIL 10, 1975 In the silence of deep night and in the quiet still morning when the sun istouching the hills, there is a great mystery. It is there in all living things.If you sit quietly under a tree, you would feel the ancient earth with itsincomprehensible mystery. On a still night when the stars are clear and close,you would be aware of expanding space and the mysterious order of all things, ofthe immeasurable and of nothing, of the movement of the dark hills and the hootof an owl. In that utter silence of the mind this mystery expands without timeand space. There’s mystery in those ancient temples built with infinite care,with attention, which is love. The slender mosques and the great cathedrals losethis shadowy mystery for there is bigotry, dogma, and military pomp. The myththat is concealed in the deep layers of the mind is not mysterious; it isromantic, traditional, and conditioned. In the secret recesses of the mind,truth has been pushed aside by symbols, words, images; in them there is nomystery, they are the churnings of thought. In knowledge and its action there iswonder, appreciation, and delight. But mystery is quite another thing. It is notan experience, to be recognized, stored up, and remembered. Experience is thedeath of that incommunicable mystery; to communicate you need a word, a gesture,a look, but to be in communion with that, the mind, the whole of you, must be atthe same level, at the same time, with the same intensity as that which iscalled mysterious. This is love. With this the whole mystery of the universe isopen.This morning there wasn’t a cloud in the sky; the sun was in the valley and allthings were rejoicing, except man. He looked at this wondrous earth and went onwith his labor, his sorrow and passing pleasures. He had no time to see; he wastoo occupied with his problems, with his agonies, with his violence. He doesn’tsee the tree and so he cannot see his own travail. When he’s forced to look, hetears to pieces what he sees, which he calls analysis, runs away from it ordoesn’t want to see. In the art of seeing lies the miracle of transformation,the transformation of what is. The “what should be” never is. There’s vastmystery in the act of seeing. This needs care, attention, which is love."},{"pageContent":"APRIL 14, 1975 A very large serpent was crossing a wide cart road just ahead of you—fat, heavy,moving lazily; it was coming from a largish pond a little way off. It was almostblack and the light of the evening seen falling on it gave to its skin a highpolish. It moved in a leisurely way with lordly dignity of power. It was unawareof you as you stood quietly watching; you were quite close to it; it must havemeasured well over five feet and it was bulging with what it had eaten. It wentover a mound and you walked toward it, looking down upon it a few inches away,its forked black tongue darting in and out; it was moving toward a large hole.You could have touched it for it had a strange attractive beauty. A villager waspassing by and called out to leave it alone because it was a cobra. The next daythe villagers had put there on the mound a saucer of milk and some hibiscusflowers. On that same road further along there was a bush, high and almostleafless, that had thorns almost two inches long, sharp, grayish, and no animalwould dare to touch its succulent leaves. It was protecting itself and woe toanyone that touched it. There were deer there in those woods, shy but verycurious; they would allow themselves to be approached but not too close and ifyou did they would dart away and disappear among the undergrowth. There was onethat would let you come quite close if you were alone, bright-eyed, with itslarge ears forward. They all had white spots on a russet-brown skin; they wereshy, gentle and ever-watchful, and it was pleasant to be among them. There was acompletely white one, which must have been a freak.The good is not the opposite of the evil. It has never been touched by thatwhich is evil, though it is surrounded by it. Evil cannot hurt the good but thegood may appear to do harm and so evil gets more cunning, more mischievous. Itcan be cultivated, sharpened, expansively violent; it is born within themovement of time, nurtured and skillfully used. But goodness is not of time; itcan in no way be cultivated or nurtured by thought; its action is not visible;it has no cause and so no effect. Evil cannot become good, for that which isgood is not the product of thought; it lies beyond thought, like beauty. Thething that thought produces thought can undo, but it is not the good; as it isnot of time, the good has no abiding place. Where the good is, there is order,not the order of authority, punishment, and reward; this order is essential, forotherwise society destroys itself and man becomes evil, murderous, corrupt, anddegenerate. For man is society; they are inseparable. The law of the good iseverlasting, unchanging and timeless. Stability is its nature and so it isutterly secure. There is no other security."},{"pageContent":"KRISHNAMURTI TO HIMSELF [index_split_001.html#filepos4585]"},{"pageContent":"MARCH 30, 1984 Walking down the straight road on a lovely morning, it was spring, and the skywas extraordinarily blue; there wasn’t a cloud in it, and the sun was just warm,not too hot. It felt nice. And the leaves were shining and a sparkle was in theair. It was really a most extraordinarily beautiful morning. The high mountainwas there, impenetrable, and the hills below were green and lovely. And as youwalked along quietly, without much thought, you saw a dead leaf, yellow andbright red, a leaf from the autumn. How beautiful that leaf was, so simple inits death, so lively, full of the beauty and vitality of the whole tree and thesummer. Strange that it had not withered. Looking at it more closely, one sawall the veins and the stem and the shape of that leaf. That leaf was all thetree.Why do human beings die so miserably, so unhappily, with a disease, old age,senility, the body shrunk, ugly? Why can’t they die naturally and as beautifullyas this leaf? What is wrong with us? In spite of all the doctors, medicines, andhospitals, operations and all the agony of life, and the pleasures too, we don’tseem able to die with dignity, simplicity, and with a smile.Once, walking along a lane, one heard behind one a chant, melodious, rhythmic,with the ancient strength of Sanskrit. One stopped and looked around. An eldestson, naked to his waist, was carrying a terra-cotta pot with a fire burning init. He was holding it in another vessel and behind him were two men carrying hisdead father, covered with a white cloth, and they were all chanting. One knewwhat that chant was, one almost joined in. They went past and one followed them.They were going down the road chanting, and the eldest son was in tears. Theycarried the father to the beach where they had already collected a great pile ofwood and they laid the body on top of that heap of wood and set it on fire. Itwas all so natural, so extraordinarily simple: there were no flowers, there wasno hearse, there were no black carriages with black horses. It was all veryquiet and utterly dignified. And one looked at that leaf, and a thousand leavesof the tree. The winter brought that leaf from its mother on to that path and itwould presently dry out completely and wither, be gone, carried away by thewinds and lost.As you teach children mathematics, writing, reading, and all the business ofacquiring knowledge, they should also be taught the great dignity of death, notas a morbid, unhappy thing that one has to face eventually, but as something ofdaily life—the daily life of looking at the blue sky and the grasshopper on aleaf. It is part of learning, as you grow teeth and have all the discomfort ofchildish illnesses. Children have extraordinary curiosity. If you see the natureof death, you don’t explain that everything dies, dust to dust, and so on, butwithout any fear you explain it to them gently and make them feel that theliving and the dying are one—not at the end of one’s life after fifty, sixty, orninety years, but that death is like that leaf. Look at the old men and women,how decrepit, how lost, how unhappy, and how ugly they look. Is it because theyhave not really understood either the living or the dying? They have used life,they waste away their life with incessant conflict, which only exercises andgives strength to the self, the “me,” the ego. We spend our days in suchvarieties of conflict and unhappiness, with some joy and pleasure, drinking,smoking, late nights, and work, work, work. And at the end of one’s life onefaces that thing called death and is frightened of it. One thinks it can alwaysbe understood, felt deeply. The child with his curiosity can be helped tounderstand that death is not merely the wasting of the body through disease, oldage, and some unexpected accident, but that the ending of every day is also theending of oneself every day.There is no resurrection; that is superstition, a dogmatic belief. Everything onearth, on this beautiful earth, lives, dies, comes into being and withers away.To grasp this whole movement of life requires intelligence, not the intelligenceof thought, or books, or knowledge, but the intelligence of love and compassion,with its sensitivity. One is very certain that if the educator understands thesignificance of death and the dignity of it, the extraordinary simplicity ofdying—understands it not intellectually but deeply—then he may be able to conveyto the student, to the child, that dying, the ending, is not to be avoided, isnot something to be frightened of, for it is part of one’s whole life, so thatas the student, the child, grows up he will never be frightened of the ending.If all the human beings who have lived before us, past generations upongenerations, still lived on this earth, how terrible it would be. The beginningis not the ending.And one would like to help—no, that’s the wrong word—one would like in educationto bring death into some kind of reality, actuality, not of someone else dyingbut of each one of us, however old or young, having inevitably to face thatthing. It is not a sad affair of tears, of loneliness, of separation. We kill soeasily, not only the animals for one’s food but the vast unnecessary killing foramusement, called sport—killing a deer because that is the season. Killing adeer is like killing your neighbor. You kill animals because you have lost touchwith nature, with all the living things on this earth. You kill in wars for somany romantic, nationalistic, political ideologies. In the name of God you havekilled people. Violence and killing go together.As one looked at that dead leaf with all its beauty and color, maybe one wouldvery deeply comprehend, be aware of, what one’s own death must be, not at thevery end but at the very beginning. Death isn’t some horrific thing, somethingto be avoided, something to be postponed, but rather something to be with day inand day out. And out of that comes an extraordinary sense of immensity."},{"pageContent":"PART 3LIFE’S QUESTIONS [index_split_001.html#filepos4727] As well as giving thousands of public talks and having many private discussionswith individuals, Krishnamurti invited questions from those who attended theyearly gatherings in many countries. Even in later years, when the questionswere written, rather than spoken from the audience, these were always exploredafresh, spontaneously, “together as friends” as he often reminded his listeners.He was involved in frequent meetings and seminars with scientists, educators,and the students and staff members of the schools founded by the variousKrishnamurti Foundations. He held dialogues with psychiatrists andpsychologists, professionals of almost every kind, and with the trustees of thefoundations responsible for arranging his talks and travels, disseminating theteachings and maintaining the schools.Krishnamurti considered the proper education of the young to be of crucialconcern for each generation. He inspired the founding of schools which bore hisname in India, England, and the United States. Visiting them often, and sittinginformally with students and teachers, he would talk with them of the need tolearn about themselves. Beyond their becoming academically capable, he stressedthe need to be whole and integrated human beings with a concern for all humanityand the global environment.This part includes questions taken from accounts in The Collected Works,Beginnings of Learning, The Wholeness of Life, forty years of public meetings,as well as dialogues with students and teachers, and trustees of the variousfoundations.

[index_split_001.html#filepos4897] If we can begin by considering what it is to be serious, then perhaps ourinvestigation into the whole process of our thinking and responding to thevarious challenges of life will have deeper significance.What do we mean by being serious? And are we ever really serious? Most of usthink very superficially; we never sustain a particular intention and carry itthrough because we have so many contradictory desires, each desire pulling in adifferent direction. One moment we are serious about something, and the next itis forgotten, and we pursue a different object at a different level. And is itpossible to maintain an integrated outlook toward life? I think this is a fairlyimportant question to consider because I wonder how many of us are serious atall? Or are we serious only about those things which give us satisfaction andhave but a temporary meaning?So I think it would be very interesting not merely to listen to a talk which Ihappen to be giving, but earnestly to try to find out together what it means tobe serious. When a petty mind gives its effort to being serious, its seriousnessis bound to be very shallow because it is without any understanding of thedeeper significance of its own process. One may give one’s energies to aparticular object, spiritual or mundane, but as long as the mind remains petty,complex, without any understanding of itself, its serious activities will havevery little significance. That is why it seems to me very important, especiallyat this time when there are so many complex problems, so many challenges, that afew of us at least should have a sustained interest in trying to find out if itis possible to be earnest or serious without being distracted by the superficialactivities of the mind.I don’t know if you are interested in this problem, but it is surely quiteimportant to find out why most people are not really serious because it is onlya serious mind that can pursue a particular activity to its end and discover itssignificance. If one is to be capable of action which is integral, one mustunderstand the ways of one’s own mind, and without that understanding, merely tobe serious has very little meaning. I wonder if any of you are following allthis, and whether I am explaining myself?We see the disintegrating process that is going on in the world. The old socialorder is breaking down, the various religious organizations, the beliefs, themoral and ethical structures in which we have been brought up, are all failing.Throughout our so-called civilization, whether Indian, European, or whatever itbe, there is corruption, and every form of useless activity is being carried on.So, is it possible for you and me to be aware of this whole process ofdisintegration and, stepping out of it as individuals, be serious in ourintention to create a totally different kind of world, a different kind ofculture, civilization? Do you think we could discuss this instead of my giving atalk?The problem is this: Being caught up in this social, religious, and moraldisintegration, how can we as individuals break away and create a differentworld, a different social order, a different way of looking at life? Is this aproblem to any of you, or are you content merely to observe this disintegrationand respond to it in the habitual manner? Can we this evening discuss thisproblem together, think it right through, and resolve it in ourselves? Do youthink it would be profitable to discuss what we mean by change?QUESTIONER: Let us discuss seriousness.KRISHNAMURTI: What do we mean by seriousness? To be serious, to be earnest,surely implies the capacity to find out what is true. Can I find out what istrue if my mind is tethered to any particular point of view? If it is bound byknowledge, by belief, if it is caught in the conditioning influences that areconstantly impinging upon it, can the mind discover anything new? Does notseriousness imply the total application of one’s mind to any problem of life?Can a mind which is only partially attentive, which is contradictory withinitself, however much it may attempt to be serious, ever respond adequately tothe challenge of life? Is a mind that is torn by innumerable desires, eachpulling in a different direction, capable of discovering what is true, howevermuch it may try? And is it not, therefore, very important to haveself-knowledge, to be serious in the process of understanding the self, with allits contradictions? Can we discuss that?Q: Would you kindly tell us if life and the problems of life are the same?K: Can you separate the problems of life from life itself? Is life differentfrom the problems which life awakens in us? Let us take that one question andfollow it right through.Q: What about the atomic and the hydrogen bombs? Can we discuss that?K: That involves the whole problem of war and how to prevent war, does it not?Can we discuss that so as to clarify our own minds, pursue it seriously,earnestly, to the end and thereby know the truth of the matter completely?What do we mean by peace? Is peace the opposite, the antithesis, of war? Ifthere were no war, would we have peace? Are we pursuing peace, or is what wecall peace merely a space between two contradictory activities? Do we reallywant peace, not only at one level, economic or spiritual, but totally? Or is itthat we are continually at war within ourselves and, therefore, outwardly? If wewish to prevent war, we must obviously take certain steps, which really meanshaving no frontiers of the mind because belief creates enmity. If you believe incommunism and I believe in capitalism, or if you are a Hindu and I am aChristian, obviously there is antagonism between us. So, if you and I desirepeace, must we not abolish all the frontiers of the mind? Or do we merely wantpeace in terms of satisfaction, maintaining the status quo after achieving acertain result?You see, I don’t think it is possible for individuals to stop war. War is like agiant mechanism that, having been set going, has gathered great momentum, andprobably it will go on and we shall be crushed, destroyed in the process. But ifone wishes to step out of that mechanism, the whole machinery of war, what isone to do? That is the problem, is it not? Do we really want to stop war,inwardly as well as outwardly? After all, war is merely the dramatic outwardexpression of our inward struggle, is it not? And can each one of us cease to beambitious? Because as long as we are ambitious, we are ruthless, whichinevitably produces conflict between ourselves and other individuals, as well asbetween one group or nation and another This means, really, that as long as youand I are seeking power in any direction, power being evil, we must producewars. And is it possible for each one of us to investigate the process ofambition, of competition, of wanting to be somebody in the field of power, andput an end to it? It seems to me that only then can we as individuals step outof this culture, this civilization that is producing wars.Let us discuss this. Can we as individuals put an end in ourselves to the causesof war? One of the causes is obviously belief, the division of ourselves asHindus, Buddhists, Christians, communists, or capitalists. Can we put all thataside?Q: All the problems of life are unreal, and there must be something real onwhich we can rely. What is that reality?K: Do you think the real and the unreal can so easily be divided? Or does thereal come into being only when I begin to understand what is unreal? Have youeven considered what the unreal is? Is pain unreal? Is death unreal? If you loseyour bank account, is that unreal? A man who says, “All this is unreal;therefore, let us find the real,” is escaping from reality.Can you and I put an end in ourselves to the factors that contribute to warwithin and without? Let us discuss that, not merely verbally, but reallyinvestigate it, go into it earnestly and see if we can eradicate in ourselvesthe cause of hate, of enmity, this sense of superiority, ambition, and all therest of it. Can we eradicate all this? If we really want peace, it must beeradicated, must it not? If you would find out what is real, what is God, whatis truth, you must have a very quiet mind, and can you have a quiet mind if youare ambitious, envious, if you are greedy for power, position, and all that? So,if you are really earnest, really serious in wanting to understand what is true,must not these things be put away? Does not earnestness, seriousness, consist inunderstanding the process of the mind, of the self, which creates all theseproblems, and dissolving it?Q: How can we uncondition ourselves?K: But I am showing you. What is conditioning? It is the tradition that has beenimposed upon you from childhood, or the beliefs, the experiences, the knowledge,that one has accumulated for oneself. They are all conditioning the mind.Now, before we go into the more complex aspects of the question, can you ceaseto be a Hindu, with all its implications, so that your mind is capable ofthinking, responding, not according to a modified Hinduism, but completely anew?Can there be in you a total revolution so that the mind is fresh, clear, and,therefore, capable of investigation? That is a very simple question. I can givea talk about it, but it will have no meaning if you merely listen and then goaway agreeing or disagreeing, whereas if you and I can discuss this problem andgo through it together to the very end, then perhaps our talking will beworthwhile.So, can you and I who wish to have peace, or who talk about peace, eradicate inourselves the causes of antagonism, of war? Shall we discuss that?Q: Are individuals impotent against the atomic and hydrogen bombs?K: They are going on experimenting with these bombs in America, in Russia, andelsewhere, and what can you and I do about it? So what is the point ofdiscussing this matter? You may try to create public opinion by writing to thepapers about how terrible it is, but will that stop the governments frominvestigating and creating the H-bomb? Are they not going to go on with itanyhow? They may use atomic energy for peaceful as well as destructive purposes,and probably within five or ten years they will have factories running on atomicenergy; but they will also be preparing for war. They may limit the use ofatomic weapons, but the momentum of war is there, and what can we do? Historicalevents are in movement, and I don’t think you and I living here in Banaras canstop that movement. Who is going to care? But what we can do is somethingcompletely different. We can step out of the present machinery of society, whichis constantly preparing for war, and perhaps by our own total inward revolution,we shall be able to contribute to the building of a civilization which isaltogether new.After all, what is civilization? What is the Indian or the Europeancivilization? It is an expression of the collective will, is it not? The will ofthe many has created this present civilization in India, and cannot you and Ibreak away from it and think entirely differently about these matters? Is it notthe responsibility of serious people to do this? Must there not be seriouspeople who see this process of destruction going on in the world, whoinvestigate it, and who step out of it in the sense of not being ambitious andall the rest of it?What else can we do? But, you see, we are not willing to be serious, that is thedifficulty. We don’t want to tackle ourselves, we want to discuss somethingoutside, far away.Q: There must be some people who are very serious, and have they solved theirproblems or the problems of the world?K: That is not a serious question, is it? It is like my saying that others haveeaten when I myself am hungry. If I am hungry I will inquire where food is to behad, and to say that others are well-fed is irrelevant; it indicates that I amnot really hungry. Whether there are serious people who have solved theirproblems is not important. Have you and I solved our problems? That is much moreimportant, is it not? Can a few of us discuss this matter very seriously,earnestly pursue it and see what we can do, not merely intellectually, verbally,but actually?Q: Is it really possible for us to escape the impact of modern civilization?K: What is modern civilization? Here in India it is an ancient culture on whichhave been superimposed certain layers of Western culture like nationalism,science, parliamentarianism, militarism, and so on. Now, either we shall beabsorbed by this civilization, or we must break away and create a differentcivilization altogether. It is an unfortunate thing that we are so eager merelyto listen, because we listen in the most superficial manner, and that seems tobe sufficient for most of us. Why does it seem so extraordinarily difficult forus seriously to discuss and to eradicate in ourselves the things that arecausing antagonism and war?Q: We have to consider the immediate problem.K: But in considering the immediate problem you will find that it has deeproots; it is the result of causes which lie within ourselves. So, to resolve theimmediate problem, should you not investigate the deeper problems?Q: There is only one problem, and that is to find out what is the end of life.K: Can we discuss that really seriously, go into it completely, so that we knowfor ourselves what is the end of life? What is life all about, where is itleading? That is the question, not what is the purpose of life. If we merelyseek a definition of the purpose of life, you will define it in one way and I inanother, and we shall wrangle and choose which is the better definitionaccording to our idiosyncrasies. Surely that is not what the question means. Hewants to know what is the end of all this struggle, this search, this constantbattle, this coming together and parting, birth and death. What is the whole ofexistence leading to? What does it mean?Now, what is this thing which we call life? We know life only throughself-consciousness, do we not? I know I am alive because I speak, I think, Ieat, I have various contradictory desires, conscious and unconscious, variouscompulsions, ambitions, and so on. It is only when I am conscious of these, thatis, as long as I am self-conscious, that I know I am alive. And what do we meanby being self-conscious? Surely, I am self-conscious only when there is somekind of conflict; otherwise I am unconscious of myself. When I am thinking,making effort, arguing, discussing, putting it this way or that, I amself-conscious. The very nature of self-consciousness is contradiction.Consciousness is a total process, it is the hidden as well as the active, theopen. Now, what does this process of consciousness mean, and where is itleading? We know birth and death, belief, struggle, pain, hope, ceaselessconflict. What is the significance of it all? To find out its true significanceis what we are trying to do. And one can find out its true significance onlywhen the mind is capable of investigation; that is, when it is not anchored toany conclusion. Is that not so?Q: Is it investigation, or reinvestigation?K: There is reinvestigation only when the mind is tethered, repetitive and,therefore, constantly reinvestigating itself. But to be free to investigate, tofind out what is true, surely that requires a mind that is not held in thebondage of any conclusion.Now, can you and I find out what is the significance of this whole struggle,with all its ramifications? If that is one’s intention and one is serious,earnest, can one’s mind have any conclusion about it? Must one not be open tothis confusion? Must one not investigate it with a free mind to find out what istrue? So, what is important is not the problem but to see if it is possible forthe mind to be free to investigate and find out the truth of it.Can the mind be free from all conclusions? A conclusion is merely the responseof a particular conditioning, is it not? Take the conclusion of reincarnation.Whether reincarnation is factual or not is irrelevant. Why do you have thatconclusion? Is it because the mind is afraid of death? Such a mind, believing ina certain conclusion which is the result of fear, hope, longing, is obviouslyincapable of discovering what is true with regard to death. So, if we are at allserious, our first problem, even before we ask what this whole process of lifemeans, is to find out whether the mind can be free from all conclusions.Q: Do you mean that for serious thinking the mind must be completely empty?K: What do we mean by freedom? What does it mean to be free? You assume that ifthe mind is free, not tethered to any conclusion, it is in a state of vacuum.But is it? We are trying to find out the truth of what is a free mind. Is a mindfree that has concluded? If I read Shankara, Buddha, Einstein, Marx—it does notmatter who it is—and reach a conclusion or believe in a certain system ofthought, is my mind free to investigate?Q: Has comparison no place in the process of investigation?K: Comparing what? Comparing one conclusion with another, one belief withanother? I want to find out the significance of this whole process of life, withits struggle, its pain, its misery, its wars, its appalling poverty, cruelty,enmity; I want to find out the truth of all that. To do so must I not have amind that is capable of investigation? And can the mind investigate if it has aconclusion, or compares one conclusion with another?Q: Can a mind be called free if it has only a tentative conclusionK: Tentative or permanent, a conclusion is already a bondage, is it not? Do,please, think with me a little. If one wants to find out whether there is such athing as God, what generally happens? By reading certain books or listening tothe arguments of some learned person, one is persuaded that there is God, or onebecomes a communist and is persuaded that there isn’t. But if one wants to findout the truth of the matter, can one belong to either side? Must not one’s mindbe free from all speculation, from all knowledge, all belief?Now, how is the mind to be free? Will the mind ever be free if it follows amethod to be free? Can any method, any practice, any system, however noble,however new or tried out for centuries, make the mind free? Or does the methodmerely condition the mind in a particular way, which we then call freedom? Themethod will produce its own results, will it not? And when the mind seeks aresult through a method, the result being freedom, will such a mind be free?Look, suppose one has a particular belief, a belief in God, or what you will.Must one not find out how that belief has come into being? This does not meanthat you must not believe, but why do you believe? Why does the mind say, “Thisis so”? And can the mind discover how beliefs came into being?You see insecurity in everything about you, and you believe in a Master, inreincarnation, because that belief gives you hope, a sense of security, does itnot? And can a mind that is seeking security ever be free? Do you follow? Themind is seeking security, permanency; it is moved by a desire to be safe, andcan such a mind be free to find out what is true? To find out what is true, mustnot the mind let go of its beliefs, put away its desire to be secure? And isthere a method by which to let go of the beliefs which give you hope, a sense ofsecurity? You see, this is what I mean by being serious.Q: Are there periods of freedom in the conditioned mind?K: Are there periods or gaps of freedom in the conditioned mind? Which is itthat you are aware of, the freedom or the conditioned mind? Please take thisquestion seriously. Our minds are conditioned, that is obvious. One’s mind isconditioned as a Hindu, as a communist, this or that. Now can the conditionedmind ever know freedom, or only what it imagines to be freedom? And can you beaware of how your mind is conditioned? Surely, that is our problem, not whatfreedom is. Can you just be aware of your conditioning, which is to see thatyour mind functions in a particular manner? We are not talking of how to alterit, how to bring about a change; that is not the question. Your mind functionsas a Hindu or a modified Hindu, as a Christian or a communist; it believes insomething. Are you aware of that?Q: Freedom is not an acquisition but a gift.K: That is a supposition. If freedom were a gift it would only be for the chosenfew, and that would be intolerable. Do you mean to say that you and I cannotthink it out and be free? You see, sir, that is what I am saying: we are notserious. To know how one is conditioned is the first step toward freedom. But dowe know how we are conditioned? When you make a red mark on your forehead, whenyou put on the sacred thread, do puja, or follow some leader, are not those theactivities of a conditioned mind? And can you drop all that so that in droppingit you will find out what is true? That is why it is only to the serious thattruth is shown, not to those who are merely seeking security and are caught insome form of conclusion. I am just saying that when the mind is tethered to anyparticular conclusion, whether temporary or permanent, it is incapable ofdiscovering something new.Q: A scientist has data. Is he prepared to give up those data?K: Are you talking as a scientist or as a human being? Even the poor scientist,if he wants to discover anything, has to put aside his knowledge andconclusions, because they will color any discovery. Sir, to find out, we mustdie to the things we know.Q: Can the unconditioning of the mind be done at the conscious or unconsciouslevel, or both?K: Sir, what is the mind? There is the conscious mind and the unconscious mind.The conscious mind is occupied with the everyday duties—it observes, thinks,argues, attends to a job, and so on. But are we aware of the unconscious mind?The unconscious mind is the repository of racial instinct, it is the residue ofthis civilization, of this culture, in which there are certain urges, variousforms of compulsion. And can this whole mind, the unconscious as well as theconscious, uncondition itself?Now, why do we divide the mind as the conscious and the unconscious? Is theresuch a definite barrier between the conscious and the unconscious mind? Or arewe so taken up with the conscious mind that we have never considered or beenopen to the unconscious? And can the conscious mind investigate, probe into theunconscious, or is it only when the conscious mind is quiet that the unconsciouspromptings, hints, urges, compulsions come into being? So, the unconditioning ofthe mind is not a process of the conscious or of the unconscious; it is a totalprocess which comes about with the earnest intention to find out if your mind isconditioned.Please look at this and experiment with it. What is important is the total,earnest intention to find out if your mind is conditioned so that you discoveryour conditioning, and do not just say that your mind is or is not conditioned.When you look into a mirror you see your face as it is; you may wish that someparts of it were different, but the actual fact is shown in the mirror. Now, canyou look at your conditioning in a similar way? Can you be totally aware of yourconditioning without the desire to alter it? You are not aware of it totallywhen you wish to change it, when you condemn it, or compare it with somethingelse. But when you can look at the fact of your conditioning without comparison,without judgment, then you are seeing it as a total thing, and only then isthere a possibility of freeing the mind from that conditioning.You see, when the mind is totally aware of its conditioning, there is only themind: there is no “you” separate from the mind. But when the mind is onlypartially aware of its conditioning, it divides itself, it dislikes itsconditioning or says it is a good thing; and as long as there is condemnation,judgment, or comparison, there is incomplete understanding of conditioning and,therefore, the perpetuation of that conditioning, whereas, if the mind is awareof its conditioning without condemning or judging, but merely watching it, thenthere is a total perception, and you will find, if you so perceive it, that themind frees itself from that conditioning.This is what I mean by being serious. Experiment with this, not just casually,but seriously watch your mind in action all the time—when you are at the dinnertable, when you are talking, when you are walking—so that your mind becomesentirely aware of all its activities. Then only can there be freedom fromconditioning and, therefore, the total stillness of the mind in which alone itis possible to find out what is truth. If there is not that stillness, which isthe outcome of a total understanding of conditioning, your search for truth hasno meaning at all, it is merely a trap.Banaras, India, January 9, 1955"},{"pageContent":"CAN WE CREATE A NEW CULTURE? [index_split_001.html#filepos5052] I think that one of the greatest problems confronting man at this present timeis the question of creativeness, how to bring about the creative release of theindividual, and if we can consider the question, not merely verbally, but gointo it very deeply, perhaps we shall be able to discover the full significanceof that word creativeness. It seems to me that this is the real issue, not whatkind of political reform to work for, or what kind of religion to follow. How isit possible to bring about the creative release of the individual, not only atthe beginning of his existence, but throughout life? That is, how is theindividual to have abundant energy rightly directed so that his life will haveexpansive and profound significance?I feel that revolution is necessary at the most profound level, not fragmentaryrevolution, but integrated revolution, a total revolution starting not from theoutside but from within; and to bring about that total revolution, surely wemust understand the ways of our own thought, the whole process of our thinking,which is self-knowledge. Without the foundation of self-knowledge, what we thinkhas very little meaning. So it is important, is it not, that from the verybeginning we should understand the process of our thinking, the ways of ourmind; and the revolution must take place, not in any given department ofthought, but in the totality of the mind itself. But before we go into that, Ithink it is essential to find out what it means to listen.Very few of us listen directly to what is being said, we always translate orinterpret it according to a particular point of view, whether Hindu, Muslim, orcommunist. We have formulations, opinions, judgments, beliefs through which welisten, so we are actually never listening at all; we are only listening interms of our own particular prejudices, conclusions, or experiences. We arealways interpreting what we hear, and obviously that does not bring aboutunderstanding. What brings about understanding, surely, is to listen without anyanchorage, without any definite conclusion, so that you and I can think out theproblem together, whatever the problem may be. If you know the art of listening,you will not only find out what is true in what is being said, but you will alsosee the false as false and the truth in the false; but if you listenargumentatively, then it is fairly clear that there can be no understanding,because argument is merely your opinion against another opinion, or yourjudgment against another, and that actually prevents the understanding ordiscovery of the truth in what is being said.So, is it possible to listen without any prejudice, without any conclusion,without interpretation? Because it is fairly obvious that our thinking isconditioned, is it not? We are conditioned as Hindus, or communists, orChristians, and whatever we listen to, whether it is new or old, is alwaysapprehended through the screen of this conditioning; therefore, we can neverapproach any problem with a fresh mind. That is why it is very important to knowhow to listen, not only to what is being stated, but to everything. It isclearly necessary that a total revolution should take place in the individual,but such a revolution cannot take place unless there is effortless comprehensionof what is truth. Effort at any level is obviously a form of destruction, and itis only when the mind is very quiet, not making an effort, that understandingtakes place. But with most of us, effort is the primary thing; we think effortis essential, and that very effort to listen, to understand, preventscomprehension, the immediate perception of what is true and what is false.Now, being aware of your conditioning, and yet being free of it, can you listenso as to comprehend what is being said? Can you listen without making an effort,without interpreting, which is to give total attention? For most of us,attention is merely a process of concentration, which is a form ofexclusiveness, and as long as there is the resistance of exclusive thinking, atotal revolution obviously cannot take place, and it is imperative, I feel, thatsuch a revolution should take place in the individual, for only in thatrevolution is there creative release.So, the mind is conditioned by modern education, by society, by religion, and bythe knowledge and the innumerable experiences which we have gathered; it isshaped, put into a mold, not only by our environment, but also by our ownreactions to that environment and to various forms of relationship.Please bear in mind that you are not merely listening to me, but are actuallyobserving the process of your own thinking. What I am saying is only adescription of what is taking place in your own mind. If one is at all aware ofone’s own thinking, one will see that a mind that is conditioned, however muchit may try to change, can only change within the prison of its own conditioning,and such a change is obviously not revolution. I think that is the first thingto understand—that as long as our minds are conditioned as Hindus, Muslims, orwhat not, any revolution is within the pattern of that conditioning and is,therefore, not a fundamental revolution at all. Every challenge must always benew, and as long as the mind is conditioned, it responds to challenge accordingto its conditioning; therefore, there is never an adequate response.Now, we all know that there is a great crisis in the world at the present time;there is enormous poverty and the constant threat of war. That is the challenge,and our problem is to respond adequately, completely, totally to this challenge,which is impossible if we do not understand the process of our own thinking. Ourthinking is obviously conditioned; we always respond to any challenge as Hindus,Muslims, communists, socialists, Christians, and so on, and that response isfundamentally inadequate; hence the conflict, the struggle, not only in theindividual, but between groups, races, and nations. We can respond totally,adequately, fully, only when we understand the process of our thinking and arefree from our conditioning, that is, when we are no longer reacting as Hindus,communists, or what you will, which means that our response to challenge is nolonger based on our previous conditioning. When we have ceased to belong to anyparticular race or religion, when each one of us understands his background,frees himself from it, and pursues what is true, then it is possible to respondfully, and that response is a revolution.It is only the religious man who can bring about a fundamental revolution, butthe man who has a belief, a dogma, who belongs to any particular religion, isnot a religious man. The religious man is he who understands the whole processof so-called religion, the various forms of dogma, the desire to be securethrough certain formulas of ritual and belief. Such an individual breaks awayfrom the framework of organized religion, from all dogma and belief, and seeksthe highest; and it is he who is truly revolutionary because every other form ofrevolution is fragmentary and, therefore, inevitably brings about furtherproblems. But the man who is seeking to find out what is truth, what is God, isthe real revolutionary because the discovery of what is truth is an integratedresponse and not a fragmentary response.Is it possible, then, for the mind to be aware of its own conditioning andthereby bring about freedom from its conditioning? The mind’s conditioning isimposed by society, by the various forms of culture, religion, and education,and also by the whole process of ambition, the effort to become something, whichis itself a pattern imposed on each one of us by society, and there is also thepattern which the individual creates for himself in his response to society.Now, can we as individuals be aware of our conditioning, and is it possible forthe mind to break down all this limitation so that it is free to discover whatis truth? Because it seems to me that unless we do free the mind from itsconditioning, all our social problems, our conflicts in relationship, our warsand other miseries, are bound to increase and multiply, which is exactly what ishappening in the world, not only in our private lives, but in the relationshipbetween individuals and groups of individuals, which we call society.Taking that whole picture into consideration and knowing all the significance ofit, is it possible for the mind to be aware of its conditioning and liberateitself? Because it is only in freedom that there can be creativeness, butfreedom is not a reaction to something. Freedom is not a reaction to the prisonin which the mind is caught; it is not the opposite of slavery. Freedom is not amotive. Surely, the mind that is seeking truth, God, or whatever name you liketo give it, has no motive in itself. Most of us have a motive because all ourlife, in our education and in everything that we do, our action is based on amotive, the motive either of self-expansion or self-destruction. And can themind be aware of and liberate itself from all those bondages which it hasimposed upon itself in order to be secure, to be satisfied, in order to achievea personal or a national result?I think the revolution of which I am talking is possible only when the mind isvery quiet, very still. But that quietness of the mind does not come through anyeffort—it comes naturally, easily, when the mind understands its own process ofaction, which is to understand the whole significance of thinking. So thebeginning of freedom is self-knowledge, and self-knowledge is not in thewithdrawal from life but is to be discovered in the relationships of oureveryday existence. Relationship is the mirror in which we can see ourselvesfactually, without any distortion, and it is only through self-knowledge, seeingourselves exactly as we actually are, undistorted by any interpretation orjudgment, that the mind becomes quiet, still. But that stillness of mind cannotbe sought after, it cannot be pursued; if you pursue and bring about stillnessof mind, it has a motive, and such stillness is never still because it is alwaysa movement toward something and away from something.So there is freedom only through self-knowledge, which is to understand thetotal process of thinking. Our thinking at present is merely a reaction, theresponse of a conditioned mind, and any action based on such thinking is boundto result in catastrophe. To discover what is truth, what is God, there must bea mind that has understood itself, which means going into the whole problem ofself-knowledge. Only then is there the total revolution, which alone bringsabout a creative release, and that creative release is the perception of what istruth, what is God.I think it is always important to ask fundamental questions: but when we do aska fundamental question, most of us are seeking an answer, and then the answer isinvariably superficial, because there is no yes or no answer to life. Life is amovement, an endless movement, and to inquire into this extraordinary thingcalled life, with all its innumerable aspects, one must ask fundamentalquestions and never be satisfied with answers, however satisfactory they may be,because the moment you have an answer, the mind has concluded, and conclusion isnot life—it is merely a static state. So what is important is to ask the rightquestion and never be satisfied with the answer, however clever, howeverlogical, because the truth of the question lies beyond the conclusion, beyondthe answer, beyond the verbal expression. The mind that asks a question and ismerely satisfied with an explanation, a verbal statement, remains superficial.It is only the mind that asks a fundamental question and is capable of pursuingthat question to the end that can find out what is truth.QUESTIONER: In India today we see a growing disregard of all sensitive feelingand expression. Culturally we are a feeble, imitative country; our thinking issmug and superficial. Is there a way to break through and contact the source ofcreativity? Can we create a new culture?KRISHNAMURTI: Sir, this is not only a question for Indians, it is a humanquestion; it is asked in America, in England, and elsewhere. How to bring abouta new culture, a creativity that is explosive, abundant, so that the mind is notimitative? A poet, a painter longs for that, so let us inquire into it.What is civilization, what is culture as we know it now? It is the result of thecollective will, is it not? The culture we know is the expression of manydesires unified through religion, through a traditional moral code, throughvarious forms of sanction. The civilization in which we live is the result ofthe collective will, of many acquisitive desires and, therefore, we have aculture, a civilization, which is also acquisitive. That is fairly clear.Now, within this acquisitive society, which is the result of the collectivewill, we can have many reformations, and we do occasionally bring about a bloodyrevolution, but it is always within the pattern because our response to anychallenge, which is always new, is limited by the culture in which we have beenbrought up. The culture of lndia is obviously imitative, traditional; it is madeup of innumerable superstitions, of belief and dogma, the repetition of words,the worship of images made by the hand and by the mind. That is our culture,that is our society, broken up into various classes, all based onacquisitiveness; and if we do become nonacquisitive in this world, we areacquisitive in some other world, we want to acquire God, and so on. So ourculture is essentially based on acquisitiveness, worldly and spiritual; and whenoccasionally there is an individual who breaks away from all acquisitiveness andknows what it is to be creative, we immediately idolize him, make him into ourspiritual leader or teacher, thereby stifling ourselves.As long as we belong to the collective culture, collective civilization, therecan be no creativeness. It is the man who understands this whole process of thecollective, with all its sanctions and beliefs, and who ceases to be eitherpositively or negatively acquisitive—it is only such a man who knows the meaningof creativeness, not the sannyasi who renounces the world and pursues God, whichis merely his particular form of acquisitiveness. The man who realizes the wholesignificance of the collective, and who breaks away from it because he knowswhat is true religion, is a creative individual, and it is such action thatbrings about a new culture. Surely, that is always the way it happens, is itnot?The truly religious man is not the one who practices so-called religion, whoholds to certain dogmas and beliefs, who performs certain rituals or pursuesknowledge, for he is merely seeking another form of gratification. The man whois truly religious is completely free from society, he has no responsibilitytoward society; he may establish a relationship with society, but society has norelationship with him. Society is organized religion, the economic and socialstructure, the whole environment in which we have been brought up, and does thatsociety help man to find God, truth—it matters little what name you give it—ordoes the individual who is seeking God create a new society? That is, must notthe individual break away from the existing society, culture, or civilization?Surely, in the very breaking away he discovers what is truth, and it is thattruth which creates the new society, the new culture.I think this is an important question to ponder over. Can the man who belongs tosociety—it does not matter what society—ever find truth, God? Can society helpthe individual in that discovery, or must the individual, you and I, break awayfrom society? Surely, it is in the very process of breaking away from societythat there is the understanding of what is truth, and that truth then createsthe ripples which become a new society, a new culture. The sannyasi, the monk,the hermit renounces the world, renounces society, but his whole pattern ofthinking is still conditioned by society; he is still a Christian or a Hindu,pursuing the ideal of Christianity or of Hinduism. His meditations, hissacrifices, his practices, are all essentially conditioned and, therefore, whathe discovers as truth, as God, as the absolute, is really his own conditionedreaction. Hence, society cannot help man to find out what is truth. Society’sfunction is to limit the individual, to hold him within the boundary ofrespectability. Only the man who understands this whole process, whose action isnot a reaction, can find out what is truth, and it is the truth that creates anew culture, not the man who pursues truth.I think this is fairly clear and simple; it sounds complicated, but it is not.Truth brings about its own action. But the man who is seeking truth and acting,however worthy and noble he may be, only creates further confusion and misery.He is like the reformer who is merely concerned with decorating the prisonwalls, with bringing more light, more lavatories, or what you will, into theprison, whereas, if you understand this whole problem of how the mind isconditioned by society, if you allow truth to act and do not act according towhat you think is truth, then you will find that such action brings about itsown culture, its own civilization, a new world which is not based onacquisitiveness, on sorrow, on strife, on belief. It is the truth that willbring about a new society, not the communists, the Christians, the Hindus, theBuddhists, or the Muslims. To respond to any challenge according to one’sconditioning is merely to expand the prison, or to decorate its bars. It is onlywhen the mind understands and is free from the conditioning influences whichhave been imposed upon it, or which it has created for itself, that there is theperception of truth, and it is the action of that truth which brings into beinga new society, a new culture.That is why it is very important for a country like this not to impose uponitself the superficial culture of the West nor, because it is confused, toreturn to the old, to the Puranas, to the Vedas. It is only a confused mind thatwants to return to something dead, and the important thing is to understand whythere is confusion. There is confusion, obviously, when the mind does notunderstand, when it does not respond totally, integrally to something new, toany given fact.Take the fact of war, for example. If you respond to it as a Hindu who believesin ahimsa, you say, “I must practice nonviolence,” and if you happen to be anationalist, your response is nationalistic, whereas the man who sees the truthof war, which is the fact that war is destructive in itself, and who lets thattruth act, does not respond in terms of any society, in terms of any theory orreform. Truth is neither yours nor mine, and as long as the mind interprets ortranslates that truth, we create confusion. That is what the reformers do, whatall the saints have done who have tried to bring about a reformation in acertain social order. Because they translate truth to bring about a givenreform, that reform breeds more misery and hence needs further reform.To perceive what is truth there must be a total freedom from society, whichmeans a complete cessation of acquisitiveness, of ambition, of envy, of thiswhole process of becoming. After all, our culture is based on becoming somebody,it is built on the hierarchical principle—the one who knows and the one who doesnot know, the one who has and the one who has not. The one who has not iseverlastingly struggling to have, and the one who does not know is foreverpushing to acquire more knowledge, whereas the man who does not belong toeither, his mind is very quiet, completely still, and it is only such a mindthat can perceive what is truth and allow that truth to act in its own way. Sucha mind does not act according to a conditioned response; it does not say, “Imust reform society.” The truly religious man is not concerned with socialreform, he is not concerned with improving the old, rotting society because itis truth and not reform that is going to create the new order. I think if onesees this very simply and very clearly, the revolution itself will take place.The difficulty is that we do not see, we do not listen, we do not perceivethings directly and simply as they are. After all, it is the innocentmind—innocent though it may have lived a thousand years and had a multitude ofexperiences—that is creative, not the cunning mind, not the mind that is full ofknowledge and technique. When the mind sees the truth of any fact and lets thattruth act, that truth creates its own technique. Revolution is not withinsociety but outside of it.Q: The fundamental problem that faces every individual is the psychological painwhich corrodes all thinking and feeling. Unless you have an answer and can teachthe ending of pain, all your words have little meaning.K: Sir, what is teaching? Is teaching merely communication, words? Why do youwant to be taught? And can another teach you how to end pain? If you could betaught how to end pain, would pain cease? You may learn a technique for endingpain, physical or psychological, but in the very process of ending oneparticular pain, a new pain comes into being.So what is the problem, sirs? Surely, the problem is not how to end pain. I cantell you not to be greedy, not to be ambitious, not to have beliefs, to free themind from all desire for security, to live in complete uncertainty, and so on,but those are mere words. The problem is to experience directly the state ofcomplete uncertainty, to be without any feeling of security, and that ispossible only if you understand the total process of your own thinking, or ifyou can listen with your whole being, be completely attentive withoutresistance. To end sorrow, pain, either one must understand the ways of themind, of desire, will, choice, going into that completely, or else listen tofind the truth. The truth is that as long as there is a point in the mind whichis moving toward another point, that is, as long as the mind is seeking securityin any form, it will never be free from pain. Security is dependency, and a mindthat depends has no love. Without going through all the process of examination,observation, and awareness, just listen to the fact, let the truth of the factoperate, and then you will see that the mind is free from pain. But we doneither; we neither see, observe to find out what is truth, nor do we listen tothe fact with our whole being, without translating, twisting, interpreting it.That is, we neither pursue self-knowledge, which also brings an end to pain, nordo we merely observe the fact without distortion, as we look at our face in themirror. All that we want is to know how to end pain, we want a ready-madeformula by which to end it, which means, really, that we are lazy, there is notthat extraordinary energy which is necessary to pursue the understanding of theself. It is only when we understand the self—not according to Shankara, Buddha,or Christ, but as it actually is in each one of us in relation to people, toideas, and to things—that there is the cessation of pain.Bombay, February 16, 1955"},{"pageContent":"CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THE FACT OF EMPTINESS? [index_split_001.html#filepos5210] QUESTIONER: Beyond all superficial fears there is a deep anguish, which eludesme. It seems to be the very fear of life—or perhaps of death. Or is it the vastemptiness of life?KRISHNAMURTI: I think most of us feel this; most of us feel a great sense ofemptiness, a great sense of loneliness. We try to avoid it, we try to run awayfrom it, we try to find security, permanency, away from this anguish.Or, we try to be free of it by analyzing the various dreams, the variousreactions. But it is always there, eluding us, and not to be resolved so easilyand so superficially. Most of us are aware of this emptiness, of thisloneliness, of this anguish. And, being afraid of it, we seek security, a senseof permanency, in things or property, in people or relationship, or in ideas,beliefs, dogmas, in name, position, and power. But can this emptiness bebanished by merely running away from ourselves? And is not this running awayfrom ourselves one of the causes of confusion, pain, misery, in ourrelationships and, therefore, in the world?So, this is a question not to be brushed aside as being bourgeois, or stupid, ormerely for those who are not active socially, religiously. We must examine itvery carefully and go into it fully. As I said, most of us are aware of thisemptiness, and we try to run away from it. In running away from it, we establishcertain securities, and then those securities become all-important to us becausethey are the means of escape from our particular loneliness, emptiness, oranguish. Your escape may be a Master, it may be thinking yourself veryimportant, it may be giving all your love, your wealth, jewels, everything, toyour wife, to your family; or it may be social or philanthropic activity. Anyform of escape from this inward emptiness becomes all-important and, therefore,we cling to it desperately. Those who are religiously-minded cling to theirbelief in God, which covers up their emptiness, their anguish; and so theirbelief, their dogma, becomes essential—and for these they are willing to fight,to destroy each other.Obviously, then, any escape from this anguish, from this loneliness, will notsolve the problem. On the contrary, it merely increases the problem and bringsabout further confusion. So, one must first realize the escapes. All escapes areon the same level; there are no superior or inferior escapes, there are nospiritual escapes apart from the mundane. All escapes are essentially similar;and if we recognize that the mind is constantly escaping from the centralproblem of anguish, of emptiness, then we are capable of looking at emptinesswithout condemning it or being afraid of it. As long as I am escaping from afact, I am afraid of that fact, and when there is fear, I can have nocommunication with it. So, to understand the fact of emptiness, there must be nofear. Fear comes only when I am trying to escape from it, because in escaping, Ican never look at it directly. But the moment I cease to escape, I am left withthe fact. I can look at it without fear, and then I am able to deal with thefact.So, that is the first step—to face the fact, which means not to escape throughmoney, through amusement, through the radio, through beliefs, throughassertions, or through any other means, because that emptiness cannot be filledby words, by activities, by beliefs. Do what we will, that anguish cannot bewiped away by any tricks of the mind, and whatever the mind does with regard toit will only be an avoidance. But when there is no avoidance of any kind, thenthe fact is there, and the understanding of the fact does not depend on theinventions or the projections or calculations of the mind. When one isconfronted with the fact of loneliness, with that immense anguish, the vastemptiness of existence, then one will see whether that emptiness is a reality ormerely the result of naming, of terming, of self-projection. Because, by givingit a name, by giving it a term, we have condemned it, have we not? We say it isemptiness, it is loneliness, it is death, and these words, death, loneliness,emptiness, imply a condemnation, a resistance, and through resistance, throughcondemnation, we do not understand the fact.To understand the fact that we call emptiness, there must be no condemnation, nonaming, of the fact. After all, the recognition of the fact creates the centerof the “me,” and the “me” is empty, the “me” is only words. When I do not namethe fact, give it a term, when I do not recognize it as this or that, is thereloneliness? After all, loneliness is a process of isolation, is it not? Surely,in all our relationships, in all our efforts in life, we are always isolatingourselves. That process of isolation must obviously lead to emptiness, andwithout understanding the whole process of isolation, we shall not be able toresolve this emptiness, this loneliness. But when we understand the process ofisolation, we shall see that emptiness is merely a thing of words, mererecognition; and the moment there is no recognition, no naming of it, and henceno fear, emptiness becomes something else, it goes beyond itself. Then it is notemptiness, it is aloneness—something much vaster than the process of isolation.Now, must we not be alone? At present we are not alone—we are merely a bundle ofinfluences. We are the result of all kinds of influences—social, religious,economic, hereditary, climatic. Through all those influences, we try to findsomething beyond, and if we cannot find it, we invent it, and cling to ourinventions. But when we understand the whole process of influence at all thedifferent levels of our consciousness, then, by becoming free of it, there is analoneness which is uninfluenced; that is, the mind and heart are no longershaped by outward events or inward experiences. It is only when there is thisaloneness that there is a possibility of finding the real. But a mind that ismerely isolating itself through fear can have only anguish; and such a mind cannever go beyond itself.With most of us, the difficulty is that we are unaware of our escapes. We are soconditioned, so accustomed to our escapes, that we take them as realities. Butif we will look more deeply into ourselves, we will see how extraordinarilylonely, how extraordinarily empty, we are under the superficial covering of ourescapes. Being aware of that emptiness, we are constantly covering it up withvarious activities, whether artistic, social, religious, or political. Butemptiness can never finally be covered—it must be understood. To understand it,we must be aware of these escapes, and when we understand the escapes, then weshall be able to face our emptiness. Then we shall see that the emptiness is notdifferent from ourselves, that the observer is the observed. In that experience,in that integration of the thinker and the thought, this loneliness, thisanguish, disappears.Paris, May 7, 1950"},{"pageContent":"WHAT IS OUR BASIC PROBLEM? [index_split_001.html#filepos5381] I think most of us are easily satisfied with explanations, and we do not seemable to go beyond mere words and directly experience something original forourselves. We are always repeating like gramophone records, merely followingsome authority who promises a certain result.Now, it seems to me that religion is something entirely different. It is notthis worship of words, nor is it the projection of symbols and the experiencingof those symbols. Religion is the experiencing of that which lies beyond themeasure of the mind; but to experience that state, to realize the immensity ofit, one really has to understand the process of one’s own thinking. Most of usare indifferent to the impressions, to the pressures, to the vitality ofexistence; we are easily satisfied, and some of us dare not even look at theproblems about us and within ourselves.So I think it would be worthwhile if we could look at our problems, nottheoretically or abstractly, but actually, and see what our problems really are.Not that we are going to resolve the problem of war, or put an end to thebutchery that is going on, but we are easily led away by the very enormity ofthese issues, and there is not that clarity of thinking which can come intobeing only when we begin with ourselves, not with somebody or something else.The world problem is our problem because we are the world. What we think doesaffect the world; what we do does affect society. The individual problem isdirectly related to the world problem, and I do not think we are givingsufficient importance to the power of individual thinking and action.Historically I am sure you will find that it is always individuals who producethe great movements that are brought about.So we have to look first and foremost at our own problems because they aredirectly related to world problems, and then perhaps we shall come out of itwith a different outlook, a fresh impulse, an explosive vitality.Now, what is our basic problem? As students, or businessmen, as politicians,engineers, or so-called seekers of the truth, whatever that may be, whatfundamentally is our problem?First of all, it seems to me that the world is rapidly changing and that theWestern civilization, with its mechanization, its industrialization, itsscientific discoveries, its tyranny, parliamentarianism, capital investment, andso on, has left a tremendous imprint on our minds. And we have created throughthe centuries a society of which we are a part and which says that we must bemoral, righteous, virtuous, that we must conduct ourselves in accordance with acertain pattern of thought which promises the eventual achievement of reality,God, or truth.So there is a contradiction in us, is there not? We live in this world of greed,envy, and sexual appetites, of emotional pressures, mechanization, andconformity, with the government efficiently controlling our various demands, andat the same time we want to find something greater than mere physicalsatisfaction. There is an urge to find reality, God, as well as to live in thisworld. We want to bring that reality into this world. We say that to live inthis world we have to earn money, that society demands that we be acquisitive,envious, competitive, ambitious; and yet, living in this world, we want to bringthe other thing into being. We may have all our physical needs provided, thegovernment may bring about a state in which we have a great measure of outwardsecurity, but inwardly we are starving. So we want the state which we callreligion, this reality which brings a new impulse, an explosive vitality toaction.Surely, that is my problem, that is your problem. How are we to live in thisworld, where living implies competition, acquisitiveness, ambition, theaggressive pursuit of our own fulfillment, and also bring into being the perfumeof something which is beyond? Is such a thing possible? Can we live in thisworld and yet have the other? This world is becoming more and more mechanized;the thoughts and actions of the individual are increasingly controlled by theState. The individual is being specialized, educated in a certain pattern tofollow a daily routine. There is compulsion in every direction, and living insuch a world, can we bring into being that which is neither outward nor inward,but which has a movement of its own and requires a mind that is astonishinglyswift, a mind that is capable of intense feeling, intense inquiry? Is thatpossible? Unless we are neurotic, unless we are mentally peculiar, surely thatis our problem.Now, any intelligent man can see that going to temples, doing puja, and all theother nonsense that goes on in the name of religion is not religion at all; itis merely a social convenience, a pattern which we have been taught to follow.Man is educated to conform to a pattern, not to doubt, not to inquire; and ourproblem is how to live in this world of envy, greed, conformity, and the pursuitof personal ambition, and at the same time to experience that which is beyondthe mind, call it God, truth, or what you will. I am not talking about the Godof the temples, of the books, of the gurus, but of something far more intense,vital, immense, something which is immeasurable.So, living in this world with all these problems, how am I to capture the other?Is that possible? Obviously not. I cannot be envious and yet find out what Godor truth is; the two are contradictory, incompatible. But that is what most ofus are trying to do. We are envious, we are carried along by the old momentum,and at the same time we dream of finding out whether there is God, whether thereis love, truth, beauty, a timeless state. If you observe your own thinking, ifyou are at all aware of the operation of your own mind, you will see that youwant to have one foot in this world and one foot in that other world, whateverit may be. But the two are incompatible, they cannot be mixed. Then what is oneto do?Do you understand, sirs? I realize that I cannot mix reality with somethingwhich has no reality. How can a mind that is agitated by envy, that is living inthe field of ambition, greed, understand something which is completely still andwhich has a movement of its own in that stillness? As an intelligent human beingI see the impossibility of such a thing. I also see that my problem is not tofind God because I do not know what that means. I may have read innumerablebooks on the subject, but such books are merely explanations, words, theorieswhich have no actuality for a person who has not experienced that which isbeyond the mind. And the interpreter is always a traitor, it does not matter whothat interpreter is.My problem, then, is not to find truth, God, because my mind is incapable of it.How can a stupid, petty mind find the immeasurable? Such a mind can talk aboutthe immeasurable, write books about it; it can fashion a symbol of truth andgarland the symbol, but that is all on the verbal level. So, being intelligentand aware of this fact, I say, “I must begin with what I actually am, not withwhat I should be. I am envious, that is all I know.”Now, is it possible for me, while living in this society, to be free of envy? Tosay it is or is not possible is an assumption and, therefore, has no value. Tofind out if one can do it requires intensity of inquiry. Most of you will say itis impossible to live in this world without envy, without greed. Our wholesocial structure, our code of morality is based on envy, so you assume it is notpossible and that is the end of it, whereas a man who says, “I don’t know ifthere is a reality or not, but I want to find out; and to find out my mind mustobviously be free of envy, not just in patches, but totally, because envy is amovement of agitation”—it is only such a man who is capable of real inquiry. Weshall go into that presently.So my problem is not to inquire into reality, but to find out whether, living inthis world, I can be free of envy. Envy is not mere jealousy, though jealousy ispart of it, nor is it merely being concerned because someone else has more thanI. Envy is the state of a mind which is demanding more and more all thetime—more power, more position, more money, more experience, more knowledge. Anddemanding the “more” is the activity of a mind which is self-centered.Now, can I live in this world and be free of self-centered activity? Can I ceaseto compare myself with somebody else? Being ugly, I want to be beautiful; beingviolent, I want to be nonviolent. Wanting to be different, to be “more,” is thebeginning of envy—which does not mean that I blindly accept what I am. But thisdesire to be different is always in relation to something which is comparativelygreater, more beautiful, more this or more that, and we are educated to comparein this way. It is our daily craving to compete, to surpass, and we aresatisfied with being envious, not only consciously but also unconsciously.You feel that you must become somebody in this world, a great man or a rich man,and if you are fortunate you say it is because you have done good in thepast—all that nonsense about karma, and so on. Inwardly also you want to becomesomebody—a saint, a virtuous man—and if you observe this whole movement ofbecoming, this pursuit of the “more,” both outwardly and inwardly, you will seethat it is essentially based on envy. In this movement of envy your mind isheld, and with such a mind, can you discover the real? Or is that animpossibility? Surely, to discover the real, your mind must be completely freeof envy; there can be no demand for the “more,” either openly or in the hiddenrecesses of the unconscious. And if you have ever observed it, you will knowthat your mind is always pursuing the “more.” You had a certain experienceyesterday, and you want more of it today; or, being violent, you want to benonviolent, and so on. These are all the activities of a mind which is concernedwith itself.Now, is it possible for the mind to be free from this whole process? That is myinquiry, not whether there is or there is not God. For an envious mind to seekGod is such a waste of time; it has no meaning except theoretically,intellectually, as an amusement. If I really want to find out whether there isGod or not, I must begin with myself; that is, the mind must lie totally freefrom envy, and I can assure you, that is an enormous task. It is not just amatter of playing with words.But you see, most of us are not concerned with that; we do not say, “I will freemy mind from envy.” We are concerned with the world, with what is happening inEurope, with the mechanization of industry—anything to get away from the centralpoint, which is that I cannot help to bring about a different world until I asan individual have changed fundamentally. To see that one must begin withoneself is to realize an enormous truth; but most of us overlook it; we easilybrush it aside because we are concerned with the collective, with changing thesocial order, with trying to bring about peace and harmony in the world.Few people are concerned with themselves except in the sense of achievingsuccess. I do not mean that kind of concern. I mean being concerned with thetransformation of oneself. But first of all, most of us do not see theimportance, the truth, of change; and secondly, we do not know how to change,how to bring about this astonishing, explosive transformation within ourselves.Changing in mediocrity, which is to change from one pattern to another, is nochange at all.This explosive transformation is the result of all one’s energy coming togetherto solve the fundamental problem of envy. I am taking that as the central issue,though there are many other things involved in it. Have I the capacity, theintensity, the intelligence, the swiftness, to pursue the ways of envy, and notjust say, “I must not be envious”? We have been saying that for centuries, andit has no meaning. We have also said, “I must follow the ideal of non-envy,”which is equally absurd, because we project the ideal of non-envy and areenvious in the meantime.Please observe this process. The fact is that you are envious, while the idealis the state of non-envy, and there is a gap between the two that has to befilled through time. You say, “Eventually I shall be free of envy”—which is animpossibility, because it has to happen now or never. You cannot set some futuredate on which you will be non-envious.So, is it possible for me to have the capacity to inquire into and be totallyfree from envy? How does that capacity arise? Does it arise through any methodor practice? Do I become an artist by practicing a particular technique dayafter day? Obviously not. The desire to have that capacity is a selfish movementof the mind, whereas if I do not try to cultivate it, but begin to inquire intothe whole process of envy, then the means of totally dissolving envy is alreadythere.Now, in what manner do I inquire into the process of envy? What is the motivebehind that inquiry? Do I want to be free of envy in order to be a great man, inorder to be like Buddha, Christ, and so on? If I inquire with that intention,with that motive, such inquiry projects its own answer, all of which will onlyperpetuate the monstrous world which we have now. But if I begin to inquire withhumility, that is, not with a desire to achieve success, then an entirelydifferent process is taking place. I realize that I have not got the capacity tobe free of envy, so I say, “I shall find out,” which means that there ishumility from the very beginning. And the moment one is humble, one has thecapacity to be free of envy. But the man who says, “I must have that capacity,and I am going to get it through these methods, through this system”—such a manis lost, and it is such people who have created this ugly, treacherous world.A mind that is really humble has an immense capacity for inquiry, whereas themind that is under the burden of knowledge, that is crippled with experience,with its own conditioning, can never really inquire. A humble mind says, “I donot know, I shall find out”—which means that finding out is never a process ofaccumulation. Not to accumulate you must die every day, and then you will find,because you are fundamentally, deeply, humble, that this capacity to inquirecomes of itself, it is not a thing that you have acquired. Humility cannot bepracticed, but because there is humility, your mind has the capacity to inquireinto envy, and such a mind is no longer envious.A mind which says, “I do not know,” and which does not want to become somethinghas totally ceased to be envious. Then you will find that righteousness hasquite a different meaning. Righteousness is not respectability; it is notconformity; it has nothing to do with social morality, which is mereconvenience, a manner of living made respectable through centuries ofcompulsion, conformity, pressure, and fear. A mind that is really humble, in thesense I have explained, will create its own righteousness, which is not therighteousness of a pattern. It is the righteousness of living from humility anddiscovering from moment to moment what is truth.So your problem is not the world of newspapers, ideas, and politicians, it isthe world within yourself—but you have to realize, to feel the truth of this,and not merely agree because the Gita or some bearded gentleman says it is so.If you are aware of that inner world and are watching yourself withoutcondemnation or justification from day to day, from moment to moment, then inthat awareness you will find there is a tremendous vitality. The mind that isaccumulating is frightened to die, and such a mind can never discover what istruth. But to a mind that is dying every minute to everything that it hasexperienced, there comes an astonishing vitality because every moment is new;and only then is the mind capable of discovery.It is good to be serious, and we are very rarely serious in our life. I do notmean just listening to somebody who is serious, or being serious aboutsomething, but having the feeling of seriousness in ourselves. We know very wellwhat it is to be gay, flippant, but very few of us know the feeling of beingdeeply serious without an object to make us serious—that state in which the mindapproaches every situation, however gay, happy, or exciting, with seriousintent. So it is good to spend an hour together in this way, being serious inour inquiry, because life for most of us is very superficial, a routinerelationship of work, sex, worship, and so on. The mind is always on thesurface, and to go below the surface seems to be an enormously difficult task.What is necessary is this state of explosiveness, which is real revolution inthe religious sense, because it is only when the mind is explosive that it iscapable of discovering or creating something original, new.Bombay, February 10, 1957"},{"pageContent":"HOW DO YOU APPROACH THE PROBLEMS OF LIVING? [index_split_001.html#filepos5537] I think it might be worthwhile if we went into the question of how quickly themind deteriorates and what are the primary factors that make the mind dull,insensitive, quick to respond. I think it would be significant if we could gointo this question of why the mind deteriorates, because perhaps inunderstanding that, we may be able to find out what is really a simple life.We notice as we grow older that the mind—the instrument of understanding, theinstrument with which we probe into any problem, to inquire, to question, todiscover—if misused, deteriorates, disintegrates, and it seems to me that one ofthe major factors of this deterioration of the mind is the process of choice.All our life is based on choice. We choose at different levels of our existence.We choose between white and blue, between one flower and another flower, betweencertain psychological impulses of like and dislike, between certain ideas,beliefs, accepting some and discarding others. So our mental structure is basedon this process of choice, this continuous effort at choosing, distinguishing,discarding, accepting, rejecting. And in that process there is constantstruggle, constant effort. There is never a direct comprehension, but always thetedious process of accumulation, of the capacity to distinguish, which is reallybased on memory, on the accumulation of knowledge and, therefore, there is thisconstant effort made through choice.Now, is not choice ambition? Our life is ambition. We want to be somebody, wewant to be well thought of, want to achieve a result. If I am not wise, I wantto become wise. If I am violent, I want to become nonviolent. The “becoming” isthe process of ambition. Whether I want to become the biggest politician or themost perfect saint, the ambition, the drive, the impulse of becoming is theprocess of choice, is the process of ambition, which is essentially based onchoice.So, our life is a series of struggles, a movement from one ideological concept,formula, desire, to another, and in this process of becoming, in this process ofstruggle, the mind deteriorates. The very nature of this deterioration ischoice, and we think choice is necessary, choice from which springs ambition.Now, can we find a way of life which is not based on ambition, which is not ofchoice, which is a flowering in which the result is not sought? All that we knowof life is a series of struggles ending in result; and those results are beingdiscarded for greater results. That is all we know.In the case of the man who sits alone in a cave, in the very process of makinghimself perfect there is choice, and that choice is ambition. The man who isviolent tries to become nonviolent; that very becoming is ambition. We are nottrying to find out whether ambition is right or wrong, whether it is essentialto life, but whether it is conducive to a life of simplicity. I do not mean thesimplicity of a few clothes; that is not a simple life. The putting on of aloincloth does not indicate a man that is simple; on the contrary, it may bethat by the renunciation of the outer things, the mind becomes more ambitious,for it tries to hold on to its own ideal, which it has projected and which ithas created. So if we observe our own ways of thinking, should we not inquireinto this question of ambition? What do we mean by it, and is it possible tolive without ambition? We see that ambition breeds competition—whether inchildren, in school, or among the big politicians, all the way up. This ambitionproduces certain industrial benefits, but in its wake, obviously there is thedarkening of the mind, the technological conditioning, so that the mind losesits pliability, its simplicity and, therefore, is incapable of directlyexperiencing. Should we not inquire, not as a group but as individuals, you andI, should we not find out what this ambition means, whether we are at all awareof this ambition in our life?When we offer ourselves to serve the country to do noble work, is there not init the fundamental element of ambition, which is the way of choice? And is not,therefore, choice a corruptive influence in our life because it prevents theflowering? The man who flowers is the man who is, who is not becoming.Is there not a difference between the flowering mind and the becoming mind? Thebecoming mind is a mind that is always growing, becoming, enlarging, gatheringexperience as knowledge. We know that process full well in our daily life, withall its results, with all its conflicts, its miseries and strife, but we do notknow the life of flowering. And is there not a difference between the two whichwe have to discover—not by trying to demarcate, to separate, but to discover—inthe process of our living? When we discover this, we may perhaps be able to setaside this ambition, the way of choice, and discover a flowering, which is theway of life, which may be true action.So if we merely say that we must not be ambitious without the discovery of theflowering way of life, the mere killing of ambition destroys the mind alsobecause it is an action of the will, which is the action of choice. So is it notessential for each one of us to find out in our lives the truth of ambition? Weare all encouraged to be ambitious; our society is based on the strength of thedrive toward a result. And in that ambition there are inequalities whichlegislation tries to level out, to alter. Perhaps that way, that approach tolife, is essentially wrong, and there might be another approach, which is theflowering of life, which could express itself without accumulation. After all,we know when we are conscious of striving after something, of becomingsomething; that is ambition, the seeking of a result.But there is an energy, a force in which there is a compulsion without theprocess of accumulation, without the background of the “me,” of the self, of theego; that is the way of creativity. Without understanding that, without actuallyexperiencing that, our life becomes very dull; our life becomes a series ofendless conflicts in which there is no creativity, no happiness. And perhaps ifwe can understand not by discarding ambition but by understanding the ways ofambition—by being open, by comprehending, by listening to the truth ofambition—perhaps we may come upon that creativity in which there is a continuousexpression which is not the expression of self-fulfillment but is the expressionof energy without the limitation of the “me.”QUESTIONER: In the worst of misery, most of us live on hope. Life without hopeseems dreadful and inevitable, and yet very often this hope is nothing butillusion. Can you tell us why hope is so indispensable to life?KRISHNAMURTI: Is it not the very nature of the mind to create illusion? Is notthe very process of thinking the result of memory, of verbalized thought, whichcreates an idea, a symbol, an image to which the mind clings?I am in despair; I am in sorrow; I have no way of resolving it; I do notunderstand how to resolve it. If I understand it, then there is no need forhope. It is only as long as I do not understand how to bring about thedissolution of a particular problem that I depend on a myth, on an idea of hope.If you observe your own mind, you will see that when you are in discomfort, inconflict, in misery, your mind seeks a way away from it. The process of goingaway from the problem is the creation of hope.The mind going away from the problem creates fear; the very movement of goingaway, the flight from the problem, is fear. I am in despair because I have donesomething which is not right, or some misery comes upon me, or I have done aterrible wrong, or my son is dead, or I have very little to eat. My mind, notbeing able to resolve the problem, creates a certainty, something to which itcan cling, an image which it carves by the hand or by the mind. Or the mindclings to a guru, to a book, to an idea which sustains me in my difficulties, inmy miseries, in my despair, and so I say I shall have a better time next life,and so on and on and on.As long as I am not capable of resolving my problem, my sorrow, I depend onhope; it is indispensable. Then I fight for that hope. I do not want anyone todisturb that hope, that belief. I make that belief into an organized belief, andI cling to that because out of that, I derive happiness; because I have not beenable to solve the problem which is confronting me, hope becomes the necessity.Now, can I solve the problem? If I can understand the problem, then hope is notnecessary; then depending on an idea or an image or a person is not necessarybecause dependence implies hope, implies comfort. So the problem is whether hopeis indispensable, whether I can resolve my problem, whether there is a way tofind out how not to be in sorrow—that is my problem, not how to dispense withhope.Now, what is the factor essential to the understanding of a problem? Obviously,if I wish to understand the problem, there must be no formula, there must be noconclusion, there must be no judgment. But if we observe our minds we will seethat we are full of conclusions; we are steeped in formulas with which we hopeto resolve the problem. And so we judge, we condemn. And so, as long as we havea formula, a conclusion, a judgment, a condemnatory attitude, we shall notunderstand the problem.So the problem is not important, but how we approach the problem. The mind thatis wishing to comprehend a problem must not be concerned with the problem, butwith the workings of its own machinery of judgment. Do you follow?I started out with the establishment of a hope, saying that it is essentialbecause without hope I am lost. So my mind is occupied with hope, I occupy itwith hope. But that is not my problem; my problem is the problem of sorrow, ofpain, of mistakes. Is even that my problem, or is my problem how to approach theproblem itself? So what is important is how the mind regards the problem.I have altogether moved away from hope because hope is illusory, it is unreal,it is not factual. I cannot deal with something which is not factual, which hasbeen created by the mind. It is not something real; it is illusory, so I cannotgrapple with it. What is real is my sorrow, my despair, the things that I havedone, the crowded memories, the aches, and the sorrows of my life. How Iapproach the aches and sorrows and miseries in my life is important, not hope,because if I know how I approach them, then I shall be able to deal with them.So what is important is not hope but how I regard my problem. I see that Ialways regard my problem in the light of judgment—either condemning, accepting,or trying to transform it—or looking at it through glasses, through the screenof formulas of what somebody has said in the Bhagavad Gita, what the Buddha orthe Christ has said. So my mind, being crippled by these formulas, judgments,quotations, can never understand the problem, can never look at it. So can themind free itself from these accumulated judgments?Please follow this carefully—not my words, but how you approach your problem.What we are always doing is pursuing the hope and everlastingly beingfrustrated. If I fail with one hope, I substitute another and so I go on and on.And as I do not know how to approach, how to understand the problem itself, Iresort to various escapes. But if I knew how to approach the problem, then thereis no necessity for hope. So what is important is to find out how the mindregards the problem.Your mind looks at a problem. It looks at it, obviously, with a condemnatoryattitude. It condemns it in distinguishing it, in reacting to it, or it wants tochange it into something which it is not. If you are violent, you want to changeinto nonviolence. Nonviolence is unreal, it is not factual; what is real isviolence. Now to see how you approach the problem, with what attitude—whetheryou condemn it, whether you have the memories of what the so-called teachershave said about it—that is what is important.Can the mind eradicate these conditions, free itself from these conditions, andlook at the problem? Can it be unconcerned with how to free itself from theseconditions? If it is concerned with it, then you create another problem out ofit. But if you can see how these conditions prevent you from looking at theproblem, then these conditions have no value because the problem is important,pain is important, sorrow is important. You cannot call sorrow an idea and brushit aside. It is there.So, as long as the mind is incapable of looking at the problem, as long as it isnot capable of resolving the problem, there must be various escapes from theproblem, and the escapes are hopes; they are the defense mechanism.The mind will always create problems. But what is essential is that when we makemistakes, when we are in pain, to meet these mistakes, these pains, withoutjudgment, to look at them without condemnation, to live with them and to letthem go by. And that can only happen when the mind is in the state ofnoncondemnation, without any formula; which means, when the mind is essentiallyquiet, when the mind is fundamentally still; then only is there thecomprehension of the problem.Q: Will you please tell us what you mean by the words our vocation? I gather youmean something different from the ordinary connotation of these words.K: Each one of us pursues some kind of vocation—the lawyer, the soldier, thepoliceman, the businessman, and so on. Obviously, there are certain vocationswhich are detrimental to society—the lawyer, the soldier, the policeman, and theindustrialist who is not making other men equally rich.When we want, when we choose a particular vocation, when we train our childrento follow a particular vocation, are we not creating a conflict within society?You choose one vocation and I choose another, and does that not bring aboutconflict between us? Is that not what is happening in the world because we havenever found out what is our true vocation? We are only being conditioned bysociety, by a particular culture, to accept certain forms of vocations whichbreed competition and hatred between man and man. We know that, we see it.Now, is there any other way of living in which you and I can function in ourtrue vocations? Is there not one vocation for man? Are there different vocationsfor man? We see that there are: you are a clerk, I polish shoes, you are anengineer, and I am a politician. We see innumerable varieties of vocations andwe see they are all in conflict with each other. So man, through his vocation,is in conflict, in hatred, with man. We know that. With that we are familiarevery day.Now let us find out if there is not one vocation for man. If we can all find it,then the expression of different capacities will not bring about conflictbetween man and man. I say there is only one vocation for man. There is only onevocation, not many. The one vocation for man is to find out what is real.If I and you are finding out what is truth, which is our true vocation, then inthe search of that we will not be in competition. I shall not be competing withyou, I shall not fight you, though you may express that truth in a differentway; you may be the Prime Minister; I shall not be ambitious and want to occupyyour place because I am seeking equally with you what is truth. Therefore, aslong as we do not find out that true vocation of man, we must be in competitionwith each other, we must hate each other; and whatever legislation you may pass,on that level you can only produce further chaos.So, is it not possible from childhood, through right education, through theright educator, to help the boy, the student, to be free to find out what is thetruth about everything—not just truth in the abstract, but to find out the truthof all relationships—the boy’s relationship to machinery, his relationship tonature, his relationship to money, to society, to government and so on? Thatrequires, does it not, a different kind of teacher, who is concerned withhelping or giving the boy, the student, freedom—so that he begins to investigatethe cultivation of intelligence, which can never be conditioned by a societywhich is always deteriorating.So, is there not one vocation for man? Man cannot exist in isolation, he existsonly in relationship, and when in that relationship there is no discovery oftruth, the discovery of the truth of relationship, then there is conflict.There is only one vocation for you and me. And in the search of that, we shallfind the expression wherein we shall not come into conflict, we shall notdestroy each other. But it must begin surely through right education, throughthe right educator. The educator also needs education. Fundamentally, theteacher is not merely the giver of information, but brings about, in thestudent, the freedom, the revolt, to discover what is truth.Q: When you answer our questions, what functions—memory or knowledge?K: It is really quite an interesting question, is it not? Let us find out.Knowledge and memory are the same, are they not? Without knowledge, without theaccumulation of knowledge, which is memory, can you reply? The reply is theverbalization of a reaction, is it not? There is this question asked: What isfunctioning, memory or knowledge? I am only saying memory and knowledge are thesame thing essentially, because if you have knowledge but have no memory of it,it will have no value.You are asking what functions when I answer a question. Is knowledgefunctioning? Is memory functioning? Now what is it that is functioning with mostof us? Please fallow this. What is functioning with most of us when you ask aquestion? Obviously knowledge. When I ask you the way to your house, knowledgeis functioning, memory is functioning. And with most of us that is all thatfunctions because we have accumulated knowledge from the Bhagavad Gita or fromthe Upanishads or from Marx or from what Stalin has said or what your pet gurusays or your own experience, your own accumulated reactions, and from thatbackground, you reply. That is all we know. That is the actual fact. In yourbusiness that is what is functioning. When you build a bridge, that is what isfunctioning.When you write a poem, there are two functions going on—the verbalization, thememory; and the creative impulse. The creative impulse is not memory, but whenexpressed it becomes memory.So without memory, verbalization, the verbalizing process, there is nopossibility of communication. If I do not use certain words, English words, Icould not talk to you. The very talking, the verbalization, is the functioningof memory. Now the question is: What is functioning when the speaker isanswering, memory or something else? Memory, obviously, because I am usingwords. But is that all?Am I replying from the accumulated memories of innumerable speeches I have madeduring the last twenty years, which I keep on repeating like a gramophone recordmachine? That is what most of us are. We have certain actions, certain patternsof thought, and we keep on repeating them. But the repetition of words isentirely different to that because that is the way of communication.By the repetition of experience, the experiences are gathered and stored awayand, like a machine, I repeat from that experience, from that storehouse. Hereagain, there is repetition, which is again the memory functioning.So you are asking if it is possible, while I am speaking, that I am reallyexperiencing, not answering from experience? Surely there is a differencebetween the repetition of experience and the freedom of experiencing, which isbeing expressed through memory, which is the verbalization. Please listen. Thisis not difficult to understand.I want to find out what ambition means, all that it implies. Do I really, now asI am speaking, investigate afresh the whole process of ambition? Or do I repeatthe investigation which I have made yesterday about ambition, which is merelyrepetition? Is it not possible to investigate, to experience anew all the time,and not merely rely on a record, on memory, on the experience of yesterday? Isit not possible to flower, to be, all the time, now as I am speaking, withoutthe repetitious experience of yesterday, though I use words to communicate?Your question is: What is functioning when I am speaking? If I am repeatingmerely what I have said ten days ago, then it is of very little value. But if Iam experiencing as I am talking, not an imaginative feeling, but actually, thenwhat is functioning? The flowering is functioning, not through self-expression,not the “me” functioning, which is memory.So it is very important, not for me alone but for all of us, to find out if wecan keep our minds from being this storehouse of the past, and whether the mindcan be stable on the waters of life and let the memories float by withoutclinging to any particular memory, and when necessary to use that memory as wedo use it when we communicate. Which means the mind constantly letting the pastfloat by, never identifying itself with it, never being occupied with it; sothat the mind is firm, not in experience, not in memory, not in knowledge, butfirm, stable in the process, in the way of experiencing continuously.So, that is the factor which brings about no deterioration, so that the mindconstantly renews. A mind that accumulates is already in decay. But the mindthat allows memories to go by and is firm in the way of experiencing—such a mindis always fresh, it is always seeing things anew. That capacity can only comewhen the mind is very quiet. That quietness, that stillness, is not induced,cannot come about through any discipline, through any action of will, but whenthe mind understands the whole process of accumulation of knowledge, memory,experience. Then it establishes itself on the waters of life, which are alwaysmoving, living, vibrant.Q: With what should the mind be occupied? I want to meditate. Would you pleasetell me on what I should meditate?K: Now, let us find out what meditation is. You and I are going to find out. Iam not going to tell you what meditation is. We are both going to discover itafresh.The mind that has learned to meditate, which is to concentrate, the mind thathas learned the technique of shutting out everything and narrowing down to aparticular point—such a mind is incapable of meditation. That is what most of uswant. We want to learn to concentrate, to be occupied with one thought to theexclusion of every other thought, and we call that meditation. But it is notmeditation. Meditation is something entirely different, which we are going tofind out.So our first problem is why does the mind demand that it should be occupied? Doyou understand? My mind says, “I must be occupied with something, with worry,with memory, with a passion, or with how not to be passionate, or how to get ridof something, or to find a technique which will help me to build a bridge.” Sothe mind, if you observe, demands constant occupation, does it not? That is whyyou say, “My mind must be occupied with the word Om.” or you repeat “Ram Ram”;or you are occupied with drinking. The word Om. the words Ram Ram, or drinkingare all the same because the mind wants to be occupied, because it says if it isnot occupied it will do some mischief, if it is not occupied it will drift away.If the mind is not occupied, then what is the purpose of life? So you invent apurpose of life—noble, ignoble, or transcendental—and cling to that, and withthat you are occupied. It is the same whether the mind is occupied with God orwhether it is occupied with business, because the mind says consciously orunconsciously it must be occupied.So, the next thing is to find out why the mind demands occupation. Please followthis. We are meditating now. This is meditation. Meditation is not a state atthe end. Freedom is not to be got at the end; freedom is at the beginning. Ifyou have no freedom in the beginning, you have no freedom at the end. If youhave no love now, you will have no love in ten years. So what we are doing nowis to find out what meditation is. And the very inquiry into what meditation isis to meditate.The mind says, “I must be occupied with God, with virtue, with my worries, orwith my business concern,” so it is incessantly active in its occupation. Themind can only exist as long as it is active, as long as it is conscious ofitself in action, not otherwise. The mind knows itself as being when it isoccupied, when it is acting, when it has results. It knows itself as existingwhen it is in motion. The motion is occupation toward a result, toward an idea,or denial of that idea negatively.I am conscious of myself only when there is motion, in and out. So consciousnessis this motion of action, outward and inward, this breathing out of responses,of reactions, of memories, and then collecting them back again. So my mind is—Iam—only when I am thinking, when I am in conflict with a thing, when there issuffering, when there is occupation, when there is strain, when there is choice.So the mind knows itself as in motion when it is ambitious and drags itselfthere, and seeing that ambition is dull, it says, “I will occupy myself withGod.” The occupation of the mind with God is the same as the occupation of themind with money. We think that the man whose mind is occupied with God is moresacred than the man who is thinking of money, but they are factually both thesame; both want results, both need to be occupied. So, can the mind be withoutoccupation? That is the problem.Can the mind be blank, without comparing, because the “more” is the way of themind knowing that it exists? The mind that knows it exists is never satisfiedwith what is: it is always acquiring, comparing, condemning, demanding more andmore. In the demand for, in the movement of, the “more,” it knows itself asexisting, which is what we call self-consciousness, the conscious on the surfaceand the unconscious. This is our life, this is the way of our everydayexistence.I want to know what meditation is, so I say I want to be occupied withmeditation. I want to find out what meditation is, so my mind is again occupiedwith meditation. So, can the occupied mind ever be capable of meditation?Meditation, surely, is the understanding of the ways of the mind. If I do notknow how my mind operates, functions, works, how can I meditate? How can Ireally find out what is truth? So the mind must find out how it is occupied;then it begins to see with what it is occupied, and then finds that alloccupations are the same because the mind then is filling itself with words,with ideas, with constant movement, so that there is never a quietness.When the mind occupies itself with the discovery of what love is, it is anotherform of occupation, is it not? It is like the man who is occupied with passion.When you say you must find out the truth, will you find truth? Or does truthcome into being only when the mind is not occupied, when the mind is empty toreceive, not to gather, not to accumulate. Because you can only receive once.But if what you have received you make into memory with which you are occupied,then you will never receive again. Because the receiving is from moment tomoment. Therefore, it is of timelessness.So the mind, which is of time, cannot receive the timeless. So the mind must becompletely still, empty, without any movement in any direction. And that canonly take place with a mind that is not occupied—not occupied with the “more,”with a problem, with worry, with escapes; not conditioned in any belief, in anyimage, in any experience. It is only when the mind is totally free, then only isthere a possibility of immense profound stillness; and in that stillness thatwhich is eternal comes into being. That is meditation.Bombay, March 11, 1953"},{"pageContent":"WHAT IS THE CENTRAL CORE OF YOUR THINKING? [index_split_001.html#filepos5710]"},{"pageContent":"1 KRISHNAMURTI: What is the central core of your thinking? You know there isperipheral thinking, which is not really important, but at the center, what isthe momentum, the movement of that thinking? What is that “me” that is soconcerned with itself? I think about myself, that is the core, the heart of mythinking. And on the periphery I think about various things, the people here,the trees, a bird flying by, but these things don’t really very much matterunless there is a crisis on the periphery that affects the “me,” and the “me”reacts. Now what is that center from which you think, which is the “me”? And whyis there this continual occupation about oneself? I am not saying it is right orwrong, but we see that we are occupied with ourselves. Why?STUDENT: Because we think it is important.K: Why do you give it importance?S: When you are a child you have to.K: Why do you think about yourself so much? See what is involved in this.Thinking about oneself isn’t just a very small affair. You think about yourselfin relation to another with like and dislike; and you think about yourself,identifying yourself with another. I think about the person I have just left, orthe person I think I like, or the person with whom I have quarreled, or theperson whom I love. I have identified myself with all those people, haven’t I?S: What do you mean by identify?K: I love you, I have identified myself with you. Or I have hurt her and youidentify yourself with her and get angry with me. See what has happened: I havesaid something to her which is harmful and unpleasant; you are her friend andyou identify yourself with her and get angry with me. So that is part of theself-centered activity, isn’t it? Are you sure?S: But isn’t it the other person who is identifying with you?K: Is it or is it not? Let’s inquire. I like you, I am very fond of you—whatdoes that mean? I like your looks, you are a good companion and so on. It meanswhat?S: It means you are a better companion than other people and so I like beingwith you.K: Go a little deeper. What does it mean?S: You keep that person to yourself and exclude others.K: That is part of it, but go on further.S: It is pleasing to be with that person.K: It is pleasing to be with that person and it is not pleasing with anotherperson. So my relationship with you is based on my pleasure. If I don’t like youI say, “I’ll be off!” My pleasure is my concern, as is my hurt, my anger. Soself-concern isn’t just thinking about myself and identifying with this or thatpossession, person, or book. There is the peripheral occupation, and also I amcomparing myself with you; that is going on all the time, but from a center.S: You read about the refugees in India and you haven’t a personal relationshipwith them but you do identify with them.K: Why do I identify myself with those people who have been killed and chasedout of East Pakistan? I watched them the other day on television. This ishappening everywhere, not only in Pakistan. It is appalling. Now you say youidentify yourself with all those refugees; what do you feel?S: Sympathy.K: Go on, explore it, unravel it.S1: Anger against the people who caused this.S2: Frustration because you can’t do anything about it.K: You get angry with the people who do these things, who kill the young men andchase out old women and children. Is that what you do? You identify with thisand reject that. What is the structure, the analysis, of this identification?S: You don’t feel secure.K: Through identification you feel that you could do something? Move on.S: Even by taking one side you feel that you have a certain chance to dosomething.K: Say I am anti-Catholic; I identify myself with a group who are anti-clerical.Identifying myself with those, I feel I can do something. But go further, it isstill me doing something about it, it is still the occupation with myself. Ihave identified myself with something I consider greater, like India, communism,Catholicism, and so on, or with my family, my God, my belief, my house, you whohave hurt me. What is the reason for this identification?S: I separate myself from the rest of the world and in identifying withsomething bigger, that something becomes my ally.K: Yes, but why do you do this? I identify myself with you because I like you. Idon’t identify myself with him because I don’t like him. And I identify myselfwith my family, with my country, with my God, with my belief. Now why do Iidentify with anything at all? I don’t say it is right or wrong, but what isbehind this identification?S: Inward confusion.K: Is it?S: You are afraid.K: Push further.S: The confusion is caused by the identification.K: Is it? I am questioning you and you must question me too. Don’t accept what Iam saying, inquire. This whole process of identification, why does it happen?And if I don’t identify myself with you, or with something, I feel frustrated.Are you sure?S: You feel unfulfilled, empty.K: Go on. I feel sad, frustrated, not fulfilled, insufficient, empty. Now I wantto know why I identify myself with a group, with a community, with feelings,ideas, ideals, heroes, and all the rest of it. Why?S: I think it is in order to have security.K: Yes. But what do you mean by that word security?S: Alone I am weak.K: Is it because you cannot stand alone?S: It is because you are afraid to stand alone.K: You are frightened of being alone so, therefore, you identify?S: Not always.K: But it is the core, the root of it. Why do I want to identify myself? Becausethen I feel safe. I have pleasant memories of people and places so I identifymyself with that. I see that in identification I am much more secure. Right?S: I don’t know if you want to talk about this particular aspect, but if I seethe killing in Vietnam is wrong, and there is a group of anti-war demonstratorsin Washington, then I go and join them.K: Now wait a minute. There is an anti-war group and I join them. I identifymyself with them because in identifying with a group of people who are doingsomething about it, I am also doing something about it; by myself I cannot doanything. But belonging to a group of people who demonstrate, who writearticles, I am actively taking part in stopping the war, That is theidentification. We are not saying the results of that identification are good orbad, but why does the human mind want to identify itself with something?S: When is it action and when is it identification?K: I am coming to that. First, I want to be clear in myself and in talking itover find out why I should identify. And when necessary I will identify. Thatis, I must first understand what it means to cooperate. Then, when I am reallydeeply cooperating, then I will know when not to cooperate. Not the other wayround. I don’t know if you see this. If I know what is involved in cooperation,which is a tremendous thing—to work together, to live together, to do thingstogether—when I understand that, then I will know when not to cooperate.Now I want to know why I identify myself with anything. Not that I shouldn’tidentify if there is a necessity of identification in action, but before I findout how to act, or with whom I can cooperate, I want to find out why there isthis urge to identify. To have security, is that the reason? Because you are farfrom your country, from your family, you identify with this house, with a group,to be safe, protected. The identification takes place because you feel, Here Iam secure. So is the reason you identify because you are insecure? Is that it?Insecurity means fear, uncertainty, not knowing what to think, being confused.So you need protection; it is good to have protection. Is that the reason thatyou identify?What is the next step? In myself I am uncertain, unclear, confused, frightened,and insufficient; therefore, I identify myself with a belief. Now what happens?S: I find I am still insecure.K: No. I have identified myself with certain ideologies. What happens then?S: You try to make that your security.K: I have given various reasons for this identification—because it is rational,it is workable, all the rest of it. Now what happens when I have identifiedmyself with it?S: You have a conflict.K: Look what happens. I have identified myself with an ideology, with a group ofpeople, or a person; it is part of me. I must protect that, mustn’t I?Therefore, if it is threatened I am lost, I am back again to my insecurity. Sowhat takes place? I am angry with anybody who attacks or doubts it. Then what isthe actual thing that takes place?S: Conflict.K: I have identified myself with an ideology. I must protect it because it is mysecurity and I resist anybody who threatens that with a contradictory ideology.So where I have identified myself with an ideology there must be resistance; Ibuild a wall around what I have identified myself with. Where there is a wall,it must create division. Then there is conflict. I don’t know if you see allthis?Now what is the next step? Go on.S1: What is the difference between identification and cooperation?S2: It seems there has to be more understanding of cooperation.K: You know what it means to cooperate, to work together? Can there becooperation when there is identification? Do you know what we mean byidentification? We have examined the anatomy of it. Cooperation means to worktogether. Can I work with you if I have identified myself with an ideology andyou are identified with another ideology? Obviously not.S: But people have to work together.K: Is that cooperation?S: No.K: See what is involved. Because of our identification with an ideology we worktogether; you protect it and I protect it. It is our security—in the name ofGod, in the name of beauty, in the name of anything. We think that iscooperation. Now what takes place? Can there be cooperation when there isidentification with a group?S: No, because there is division. I find myself in conflict with members of thegroup, because I keep identifying with them.K: Look what is happening. You and I have identified ourselves with thatideology. Our interpretation of that ideology may be—S: Different.K: Of course. If you vary in the interpretation of that ideology, you aredeviating; therefore, we are in conflict. Therefore, we must both agree aboutthat ideology completely. Is that possible?S: That is exactly what happens with a school. Instead of an ideology, youidentify with a school and each person has his own concept.K: Yes, quite right. Why?S: I sense that sometimes there is conflict here for just the reason you weregiving when talking about an ideology. If you and I identify with the school, wethink we are cooperating, but there isn’t that spirit.K: Therefore, I am asking, can there be cooperation when there isidentification?S: No.K: Do you know what you are saying? [Laughter.] That is how everything in thisworld is working. Is that the truth? That where there is identification therecan be no cooperation? It is a marvelous thing to discover the truth of this.Not your opinion, or my opinion, but the truth, the validity of it. Therefore,we have to find out what we mean by cooperation. You see that there can be nocooperation when there is identification with an idea, with a leader, with agroup, and so on. Then what is cooperation in which there is no identification?S: Acting in response to the situation itself.K: I am not saying you are not right, but can we work together when you and Ithink differently? When you are concerned with yourself and I am concerned withmyself? And one of the reasons is that knowing we cannot cooperate when we arethinking of ourselves, we try to identify ourselves with an ideology, hopingthereby to bring about cooperation. But if you don’t identify, what iscooperation?Here we are at Brockwood, in a school. We see there cannot be cooperation whenthere is identification with the school, with an idea, with a program, with aparticular policy of this and that. And also we see that identification is thecause of all division. Then, what is cooperation? To work together—not aboutsomething. Do you see the difference? So before you do something together, whatis the spirit of cooperation—the feeling, the inwardness of it—what is thatfeeling?S: Understanding, being completely open to it.K: Go a little deeper. We said identification is not cooperation. Are you quitesure on that point? And are you quite clear that cooperation cannot exist wheneach of us is concerned with himself? When you are concerned with yourself, youhave no spirit of cooperation, you only cooperate when it pleases you. So whatdoes it mean to cooperate? What does it mean to cooperate when there is no “me”?Otherwise you can’t cooperate. I may try to cooperate around an idea, but thereis always the “me” that is trying to identify itself with the thing that I amdoing. So I must find out why it is that I am thinking about myself all daylong: how I look; that somebody is better than me; why somebody has hurt me, orsomebody has said, “What a nice person you are.” Why am I doing this all daylong? And at night too, when I’m asleep this goes on: “I am better than you”; “Iknow what I am talking about”; “It is my experience”; “You are stupid, I amclever.” Why?S: It seems a lot of it becomes a habit.K: What is habit?S: Not being aware.K: No. What is habit? Not how is it formed.S: Repetition of a movement.K: Right. Why is there a repetition of this movement? Why is habit formed? Youwill see something extraordinary if you go slowly. We have all got short hair orlong hair; why? Because others do it?S: Is that habit or imitation?K: See what takes place. First you imitate others, then you say, “Short hair issquare.”S: Is a custom a habit too?K: Yes. I don’t want to go too quickly into this. Isn’t all thinking habit? Youagree?S: Well, it is something you do over and over again.K: Go on, see what you can discover for yourself when we go into this wholequestion of habit.S: It is really a situation with an old reaction, isn’t it?K: A new situation we meet with old responses. Is not identification a habit?S: Yes.K: Because you are insecure. So do you know the nature of this machinery thatmakes for habit? Are you aware that you are always operating by habit? To get upat six o’clock every day, to believe, to smoke, not to smoke, to take drugs. Youfollow? Everything is reduced to habit—it may be of a week, ten days, or fiftyyears, but the habit is formed. Why does the mind fall into this groove? Haven’tyou asked yourself why you have a habit? Have you watched your mind working inhabit?S1: It is easier.S2: It takes really a lot of energy to live without habit.K: I am coming to that. Don’t jump, move from step to step. I am asking myself:Why does the mind always live in habit? I thought that yesterday, I still thinkthat today, and I will think the same about it tomorrow—with slightmodifications perhaps. Now why does the mind do this?S: One is half asleep.K: We said laziness is part of it. What else? It feels easier with habits.S: One is afraid of the unknown.K: I want to go a little deeper than that.S: The mind is afraid that if it doesn’t maintain thinking in the same way, itwill itself be threatened.K: Which means what?S: It sees a certain kind of order in habit.K: Is habit order?S: You can form a certain structure with habit, but that is not necessarilyorder.K: Which means that the mind functions in habit for various reasons, like amachine. It is easier, it avoids loneliness, fear of the unknown, and it impliesa certain order to say, “I will follow that and nothing else.” Now why does themind function in a groove, which is habit?S: Its nature is that.K: But if you say that, then you stop inquiring. We know the reasons that themind functions in habit; are you actually aware of it? The highly psychopathicperson has a habit which is completely different from others. A neurotic personhas certain habits. We condemn that habit but accept others. So why does themind do this? I want to go into it deeper, I want to see why it does it andwhether the mind can live without habit.S: Because it feels it is the personality.K: We said that the personality, the ego, the “me” which says, “I am frightened,I want order, laziness, all that are different facets of the ‘me.’” Can the mindlive without habit? Except for the biological habits, the regular functioning ofthe body, which has its own mechanism, its own intelligence, its own machinery.Why does the mind accept habit so quickly? The question, “Can it live withouthabit?” is a tremendous question. To say that there is God, that there is asavior, is a habit. And to say there is no savior, but only the State, isanother habit. So the mind lives in habit. Does it feel more secure in habit?S: Yes.K: Go slowly. Which means what? Functioning in the field of the known, it feelssafe. The known is habit, right?S: Even then, we still say we don’t feel safe.K: Because the known may change or may be taken away or get something added toit. But the mind is always functioning in the field of the known because thereit feels secure. So the known is the habit, the known is knowledge—that is,knowledge of science, of technology, and the knowledge of my own experiences.And in that there is mechanical habit. Now I am asking: Can the mind move fromthe known—not into the unknown, I don’t know what that means—but be free andmove away from the borders of the known?Look. If I know everything about the internal combustion engine, I can continueexperimenting in the same direction, but there is a limitation. I must findsomething new, there must be some other way to create energy.S: Would the mind say that if it wanted the security of the known?K: I am not talking about security at the moment.S: Are you saying that there has to be a break in continuity in technology inorder for something new to happen?K: That’s right. That is what takes place. Otherwise man couldn’t have inventedthe jet engine; he had to look at the problem differently.My mind always works in the field of the known, the modified, which is habit. Inrelationship with human beings, in thought—which is the response of memory andalways within the field of the known—I am identifying myself with the unknownthrough the known. The mind must function with the known because otherwise onecouldn’t talk, but I am asking if it can also function without any habit.S: Does the mind ask that question because acting out of habit is unsuccessful?K: I am not thinking of success.S: But what would make the mind ask this?K: My mind says, this isn’t good enough, I want more. It wants to find out more,and it can’t find it within the field of the known, it can only expand thatfield.S: But it has to realize the limitation.K: I realize it, and I say to myself: I can function within the field of theknown, I can always expand it or contract it, horizontally, vertically, in anyway, but it is always within the field of the known. My mind says I understandthat very well. And so, being curious, it says: Can the mind live, can itfunction, without habit?S: Is that a different question?K: Now I am talking psychologically, inwardly. Apparently all life, all themental activity in the psyche, is a continuity of habit.S: Is there really an impetus or something—K: I am creating an impetus. The mind is itself creating the impetus to findout—not because it wants to find something.S: This is a very touchy point. This seems to be the key to some difficulty.Why—if I may just ask the question—does the mind say: I see the need for livingwithout psychological habit?K: I don’t see the need, I am not positing anything. I am only saying I haveseen the mind in operation in the field of the known—contracting, expandinghorizontally or vertically, or reducing it to nothing, but always within thatarea. And my mind asks, if there is a way of living—I don’t know it, I don’teven posit it—in which there is no habit at all.So we come back. Do you know what you are thinking about all day? You say, “Yes,I am thinking about myself, vaguely or concretely, or subtly, or in a mostrefined manner, but always around that.” Can there be love when the mind isoccupied with itself all the time? You say no; why?S: Because if you are thinking about yourself all the time, you can’t—K: Therefore, you can never say, “I love you,” until you stop thinking aboutyourself. When a man feels ambitious, competitive, imitative, which is part ofthinking about oneself, can there be love?So we have to find a way of living in which habit is not. But habit can beused—the known can be used, I won’t call it habit—in a different way, dependingon the circumstances, the situation, and so on. So is love habit? Pleasure ishabit, isn’t it? Is love pleasure?S: What do you mean by love, sir?K: I don’t know. I will tell you what it is not; and when that is not in you,the other is. Listen to this: Where the known is, love is not.S: So one has to find out first what habit is, and then about non-habit.K: We have found it. We have said that habit is the continuation of actionwithin the field of the known. The known is the tomorrow. Tomorrow is Sunday andI am going out for a drive; I know that, I have arranged it. Can I say,“Tomorrow I will love”?S1: No.S2: I do.K: What do you mean, “I will love you tomorrow”?S: We promise that.K: In a church, you mean? That means love is within the field of the known and,therefore, within time.S: But if you love once, can you suddenly stop loving?K: I loved you once; I am bored with you now!S: If you love someone today, you can love him tomorrow.K: How do you know? I love you today, but you want to be sure that I’ll love youtomorrow. Therefore, I say, “I’ll love you, darling, tomorrow.”S: That is something else.K: I am asking: Has love a tomorrow? Habit has a tomorrow because it continues.Is love a continuity? Is love identification?—I love my wife, my son, my God?Therefore, you have to really understand—not just verbally—the whole process,the structure and the nature of the known, the whole field of it inwardly, howyou function always within that field, thinking from that field. The tomorrowyou can grasp because it is projected from the known. To really understand thisyou have to understand all that we have said; you have to know what you thinkand why, and you have to observe it.S: You can know what you think, but you don’t always know why you think it.K: Oh, yes, it is fairly simple. I want to know why I think, why thought comesin. Yesterday I went to the tailor and I forgot my watch there. Last night Ilooked for it and I thought about it and said, “How lazy of me, howinconsiderate on my part to leave it there, giving trouble.” All that wentthrough the mind.S: When you say it was inconsiderate of you, you were identifying yourself.K: No, I forgot the watch. Which means they have to take the trouble to lookafter it, someone might take it, they will be responsible, all that. And Ithought about it, and I know why this whole momentum of thinking arose fromthat. I watched the whole flow of thought. You can know the beginning and theending of thought. You look so mystified! I have thought about it and I can endit. I left the watch there and I thought it might get lost; I have had it for along time, I have cared for it; I would give it away, but not lose it. And if itis lost, finished. I don’t think any more about it.Now, to watch every thought, to be aware of it! Any thought is significant ifyou penetrate it; you can see the origin of it and the ending of it—not go onand on.S: And you say that if you see why the thought originated, you will be able tosee the ending of it?K: No, look. Is there an individual thought separate from another thought? Areall thoughts separate or are they interrelated? What do you say?S: They are interrelated.K: Are you sure?S: Well, they all come from one another.K: If I understand their interrelationship, or if there is an understanding ofthe background from which all thought springs—S: That is the difficult point.K: To watch without any question of wanting an answer means infinitewatchfulness. Not impatience. Watch carefully, then everything comes out. If youand I quarrel, I don’t want to carry it in my mind, in thought, I want to finishit. I’ll come to you and say, “I am sorry, I didn’t mean it”; and it isfinished. But do I do that?Have you learned a lot—not have learned, but are you learning. seeing what itmeans to learn?Brockwood Park, June 19, 1971"},{"pageContent":"2 STUDENT: We were talking about why one can’t say that one loves someone.KRISHNAMURTI: Can we approach it in a different way? Do you know whataggressiveness is? It means opposition, to go against. From that arises thequestion: How are you going to meet life when you have passed through here andare so-called educated? Do you want to be swallowed up by the society, theculture in which you live, or are you going to oppose it, revolt against it,which will be a reaction and not a total action? Are you going to step into theeasy way of life, conform, imitate, adjust to the pattern, whatever that patternbe, whether it be the establishment, or an establishment of a different kind,and so on? Or are you going to be a totally different human being, who is awareand knows he has to meet adversity and opposition and that, therefore, there isno easy way of satisfaction? Because most of us want a life of ease, of comfort,without trouble, which is almost impossible. And if you do meet opposition, willyou run away from it? If you don’t like some place, certain people, a job, willyou move away, run away from it to do something else that will be satisfactory?Do you use others for your own satisfaction? And is love the use of others,either sexually or as companionship, or for one’s own satisfaction—notsuperficially but much more deeply?How are you going to meet all this, which is what life is? The so-callededucated people in the world, who have been to college, to university, have goodjobs, fit into a place and stay there and advance there, have their owntroubles, their own adversities. One may pass some exam and get a job, or onemay have been educated technologically. But psychologically, one doesn’t knowanything about oneself. One is unhappy, miserable because one can’t get this orthat. One quarrels with one’s husband or wife. And they are all very educatedpeople who read books but disregard the whole field of life. And uneducatedpeople do the same.You are going to be educated. I don’t know why, but you are going to be. Andthen what? Lead a comfortable life? Not that one is against comfort, but if oneis seeking comfort in life it becomes rather shoddy, father shallow, and youhave to conform to a tremendous extent to the structure of the culture in whichyou live. And if you revolt against the culture and join a group, which has itsown pattern, you have to fit into that too.Most human beings throughout the world want to be safe, secure, comfortable,lead a life of indulgence, a life in which they do not have too much opposition,where they conform superficially, but revolt against conforming, becomesuperficially respectable but are inwardly rebellious, have a job, get married,have children and responsibility. But because the mind wants something much morethan that, they are discontented, running from one thing to another. Seeing allof this—not just one segment, one fraction of it, but the whole of the map—whatare you all going to do? Or is it a question that you cannot possibly answer atyour age? You are too young, perhaps, with your own occupations, so the othercan wait.S: One knows what one would like to do.K: Do you know what you want to do?S: I know what I’d like to do.K: What would you like to do? Like? I might like to be the Queen of England, orthe greatest something or other, but I can’t, I haven’t got the capacity. Sowhen you say you’d like to do something, that gives you pleasure, that gives yousatisfaction. That is what everybody wants: comfort, pleasure, satisfaction.“This is what I want to do because I feel happy doing it.” And when you findopposition along that path, you don’t know how to meet it and then you try toescape from it.You know, this is really a very difficult question; it is not easy to say whatone would like to do. This is a very complex question. That is why I said, “Isthis asking too much?” Or, at your age, are you already beginning to have aninkling of what you want to do, not only for the next year but for the rest ofyour life?S: We are not too young.K: I don’t know. I don’t know whether you are too old or too young. It is foryou to answer, not for me. I am putting this to you, for you to find out.S: Some of us are already too old. We are already shaped. Already we have hadexperiences that make us all very bored with life.K: You know, the other day we were talking about the fact that we are alwaysthinking about ourselves. And when you are thinking about yourself, isn’t itgenerally around what gives you the greatest pleasure? “I want to do that,because it is going to give me tremendous satisfaction.” So how do you meet allthese things? Shouldn’t you be educated not only in geography, history,mathematics, and all the rest of it, but also in this field, where you have todiscover for yourself how to live in this monstrous world? Isn’t that part ofeducation? Now how could you set about educating yourself to meet this life? Doyou expect somebody else to educate you, as they educate you in mathematics andother subjects?S: No.K: No? You are quite sure? If nobody is going to educate you in thepsychological, inward, way of living, how are you going to do it? How are yougoing to educate yourself? You know what is happening in the world? Apart fromthe monstrosities and wars and butcheries and all the terrible things that aregoing on, people who think they know are trying to educate you—and not just inthe technological world that is clear, simple, and factual.The other day on television some bishop said: “The knowledge of God is love andif you don’t have knowledge of God you can’t live, life becomes meaningless.”Now there is that statement made most emphatically by a well-known bishop, orwhatever he was, and I listened to it and I said: I am learning, I want to findout. I want to be educated. He has reasonable explanations, and you look at hiscollar, or his coat, or his beret, and you say, “Oh, he is a priest, he is anold man, he is repeating old stuff, that is nothing,” and you push him away. Andthen a man comes along and offers you a pattern of living which seemsreasonable, logical; and because of his personality, the way he looks, dresses,walks—you know all the tricks—you say, “Yes, he has got something.” And youlisten to him. And through the very act of listening you are being conditionedby what he says, aren’t you?S: It depends how you listen.K: If you don’t know how to listen to that bishop, you will say, “Howreasonable, he says we have lived this way for two thousand years, this is theright way, with the knowledge of God.” I listen to him and there is somethingthat appeals to me and I accept it. I have been influenced by him. And I am alsoinfluenced by a man who says, “Do this and you will have enlightenment.” So I ambeing influenced all around. What shall I do? I want to educate myself because Isee very well nobody is going to educate me in that field. Because they havenever educated themselves, they have never gone into themselves and examined,explored, searched out, looked and watched; they have always conformed to apattern. And they are trying to teach me how to live within that pattern,whether it is the Zen pattern, or the Christian, or the communist pattern. Theyhave not educated themselves in the sense we are talking about, though they maybe clever in argument and in dialectics.So as nobody is going to help me to educate myself inwardly, how shall I begin?I see that if I don’t do that I will become a lopsided human being. I may bevery good at writing an essay and getting a degree, but then what? And the wholeof the rest of my life is neglected. So how shall I educate myself, becomemature in a field where very few people have taken the trouble to investigate,to inquire? Or they have done it and imposed their thinking on others, nothelped them to find out for themselves.Do you understand what I am talking about? Freud, Jung, Adler, and otheranalysts, who have gone into this and stated some facts, traced all behavior tochildhood conditioning. They have laid down a certain pattern and you caninvestigate in that direction and get more information, but that is not youlearning about yourself; you are learning according to somebody else. Knowingwhat life is, what is happening in the world—wars, antagonism, politicians,priests, hippies with their little bit of philosophy, people who take drugs, themakers of communes, and the hatred between various classes—how will you setabout finding out for yourself? Take all that is there outwardly, and inwardlypeople are ambitious, greedy, envious, brutal, violent, exploiting each other.These are facts, I am not exaggerating.Seeing all this, what shall I do? Shall I conform to some pattern, which iscomforting, which is what I want to do, a fulfillment for myself? Because if youdon’t have a certain spark, a flame in you now at the age of fifteen, sixteen,twenty, or twenty-five, it is going to be very difficult when you are fifty.Then it is much more difficult to change. So, what shall I do? How shall I faceall this, look at it, listen to all the terrible noise in the world—the priests,the technicians, the clever men, the workers, the strikes that are going on?Shall I choose a particular noise that appeals to me and follow that noise forthe rest of my life? What shall I do? This is a tremendous problem, it is not asimple problem.S: I want to experiment.K: Experiment?S: Well, let things come to me.K: Listen to what I am saying. Seeing all this, I don’t know what to do. Notknowing what to do, I am going to find an easy way out as I generally do. Don’tfool yourself. This is a tremendously complex problem.S: But to find the easy way out is still not real.K: Wait, I am not at all sure. I face all this tremendous uproar that is goingon, the shouting, the pushing, and I find there is an easy way out—I become amonk. That is what is happening in certain parts of the world, because peopledon’t trust politicians, scientists, technicians, preachers, anymore. They say,“I am going to withdraw from all this and become a solitary monk with a beggingbowl”; they are doing it in India. Or not knowing what to do, you drift,carrying on from day to day, not bothering. Or if you must find a way out youforce yourself, or you join a group that thinks it is tremendously advanced. Isthat what you are all going to do?If I had a daughter or a son here, that would be my concern as a parent. I wouldfeel tremendously concerned. And Brockwood is concerned; it is tremendouslyimportant. You can all go to colleges and universities and get degrees and jobs,but that is too simple. That is, a way out doesn’t solve anything either. So ifI had a son or a daughter, I would ask how they are going to be educated in thefield where they themselves don’t take an interest, and where others don’t knowhow to help them to understand that enormous field that has been neglected.So I would say to a daughter or son, “Look, listen to all this, listen to allthe noise that is going on in the world. Don’t take sides, don’t jump to anyconclusions, but just listen. Don’t say one noise is better than another noise;they are all noises, so just listen first. And listen also to your own noise,your chattering, your wishes—‘I want to be this and I don’t want to be that’—andfind out what it means to listen. Find out, don’t be told. Discuss it with meand find out what it means first. Find out what it means to think, why youthink, what is the background of your thinking. Watch yourself, but don’t becomeself-centered in that watching. Be tremendously concerned, in watching, aboutfurther enlargement of yourself.” If you watch yourself, there is a tremendousdanger of self-centeredness.If I were a parent I would be tremendously concerned with the problem, thequestion, of how to educate people in this field where there is no realunderstanding or help. I would discuss to find out how you think, why you think,and what you think. Not in order to change it, not to suppress it, not toovercome it, but to find out why you think at all. Question it! I don’t know ifyou have noticed that most books, all the social, religious, moral, ethicalstructure, the relationship between man and man, are based on thinking. “This isright, this is wrong, this should be, this must not be”—it is based on thestructure of thought. I want to find out if that is the way of living, to baseeverything on thought, on what I like and what I don’t like, what I want to do,what I don’t want to do.Brockwood Park, June 24, 1971"},{"pageContent":"WHAT IS THE RELATION BETWEEN KRISHNAMURTI’S TEACHING AND TRUTH?[index_split_001.html#filepos5882]"},{"pageContent":"1 QUESTIONER 1: Can we discuss the relation between Krishnamurti’s teaching andtruth?QUESTIONER2: Is there such a thing as a teaching at all, or is there only truth?KRISHNAMURTI: Is it the expression of truth? There are two things involved. Thespeaker is either talking out of the silence of truth, or he is talking out ofthe noise of an illusion, which he considers to be the truth.Q: That is what most people do.K: So which is it that he is doing?Q: There could be a confusion between the word and truth.K: No, the word is not the truth. That’s why we said either he is talking out ofthe silence of truth or out of the noise of illusion.Q: But because one feels that he is speaking out of the silence of truth, thereis a greater possibility for the word to be taken as truth.K: No, let’s go slowly, for this is interesting. Who is going to judge, who isgoing to see the truth of the matter? The listener, the reader? You who arefamiliar with Indian scriptures, Buddhism, the Upanishads, and know most of thecontents of all that, are you capable of judging? How shall we find out? Youhear him talking about these things and you wonder if he is really speaking outof this extraordinary silence of truth, or as a reaction and from a conditionedchildhood, and so on. That is to say, either he is talking out of hisconditioning or out of the other. How will you find out? How will you approachthis problem?Q: Is it possible for me to find out if what is meeting that teaching is thenoise within myself?K: That’s why I am asking you. What is the criterion, the measure that you applyso you can say, “Yes, that is it”? Or do you say, “I don’t know”? I am askingwhat you do. Or do you not know but are examining, investigating, not whether heis speaking out of silence or conditioning, but watching the truth of what he issaying? I would want to know whether he was speaking out of this or out of that.But as I don’t know, I am going to listen to what he is saying and see if it istrue.Q: But what sees it as true?K: Say one is fairly alive to things. One listens to this man and one wants tofind out whether what he says is mere words or the truth.Q: When I have come to the conclusion that it is the truth, then I am alreadynot listening.K: No, I don’t know. My whole life is concerned with this problem; it is notjust for a few years or a few days. I want to know the truth of this matter. Ishe speaking out of experience or from knowledge, or not out of any of thesethings? Most people speak out of knowledge, so we are asking that question.I don’t know how you would find out. I’ll tell you what I would do. I would puthis personality, his influence, all that, completely aside. Because I don’t wantto be influenced; I am skeptical, doubtful, so I am very careful. I listen tohim, and I don’t say, “I know” or “I don’t know,” but I am skeptical. I want tofind out.Q: Skeptical means you are inclined to doubt it, which is already a bias—K: Oh, no! I am skeptical in the sense that I don’t accept everything that isbeing said.Q: But you lean toward doubting. It’s negation.K: Oh, no. I would rather use the word doubt, in the sense of questioning. Let’sput it that way. I say to myself, “Am I questioning out of my prejudice?” Thisquestion has never been put to me before, I am exploring it. I would puteverything else aside, all the personal reputation, charm, looks. I am not goingto accept or reject, I am going to listen to find out. Am I prejudiced? Am Ilistening to him with all the knowledge I have gathered about religion, of whatthe books have said, what other people have said, or what my own experiencetells me?Q: No. I may be listening to him precisely because I have rejected all that.K: Have I rejected it? Or am I listening to him with all that? If I haverejected that, then I am listening very carefully to what he has to say.Q: Or I am listening with everything that I already know of him?K: I have said that I have put away his reputation. Am I listening to him withthe knowledge that I have acquired through books, through experience and,therefore, I am comparing, judging, evaluating? Then I can’t find out whetherwhat he is saying is the truth. But is it possible for me to put aside all that?I am passionately interested to find out. So for the time being, while I amlistening at least, I will put aside everything I have known. Then I proceed. Iwant to know, but I am not going to be easily persuaded, pulled into somethingby argument, cleverness, logic. Now am I capable of listening to what he issaying with complete abandonment of the past? It comes to that. Are you? Then myrelationship to him is entirely different. Then I am listening out of silence.This is really a very interesting question. I have answered for myself. Thereare a dozen of us here, how would you answer it? How do you know that what he istalking about is the truth?Q: I wouldn’t be concerned with that word truth. When you use the word truth,you indicate you have the ability to judge what is true, or you already have adefinition of truth, or you know what truth is, which means you will not belistening to what somebody is saying.K: Don’t you want to know whether he is speaking falsehood, out of a conditionedmind, from a rejection and, therefore, out of a reaction?Q1: I realize that in order to listen to anybody, I can’t listen with aconditioned mind.Q2: Another question which arises is: I reject all this knowledge and listen insilence. Is truth in that silence?K: I don’t know. That is one of the things I have got to find out. How would youanswer this question?Q: I think first of all you can be sensitive to what is false. In other words,to see if there is something false, something incoherent.K: Logic can be very false.Q: Yes, I don’t mean just logic, but you can be sensitive to the wholecommunication to see if there is some deception. I think one of the questionsimplied here is: Are you deceiving yourself?K: Again, forgive me for asking, but how do you know he is speaking the truth?Or is he deceiving himself and is caught in an illusion which gives him afeeling that he is telling the truth? What do you answer?Q: One goes into it oneself. One cannot accept it without going deeply into it.K: But one can deceive oneself so appallingly.Q: You go through the layers of all those deceptions and beyond them.K: If I were a stranger I might say: You have listened to this man for a longtime, how do you know he is telling the truth? How do you know anything aboutit?Q: I could say that I have looked at what you have said, and each time I wasable to test it to see if it was right. I have not found anything that wascontradictory.K: No. The question was: How do you find out the truth? Not about contradiction,logic, all that. One’s own sensitivity, one’s own investigation, one’s owndelving, is that enough?Q: If one goes all the way, if one goes through all the possible self-deceptionsand then goes so far as to say that in the moments when one is listening onefeels there is a change in oneself, it may not be a total revolution, but thereis a change.K: That can happen when you go for a walk and look at the mountains and arequiet, and when you come back to your home certain things have taken place. Youfollow what I am saying?Q: Yes. We listen to people who speak from knowledge, and we listen to you, andthere is something totally different.K: Have you answered the question?Q: Someone wrote to me and asked if I agreed with everything Krishnamurti said.“Didn’t he tell you that you should doubt everything he said?” The only way Icould answer was to say: “Look, to me it is self-evident.”K: It may be self-evident to you and yet an illusion. It is such a dangerous,delicate thing.Q: I think that for thought it is not at all possible to be sure about thismatter. It is typical of thought that it wants to be sure that it is notdeceiving itself, that it is listening to truth. Thought will never give up thatquestion, and it is right for thought never to give up questioning, but thoughtcannot touch it, cannot know about it.K: Dr. Bohm and I had a discussion of this kind in a different way. If Iremember rightly, we said: Is there such a silence which is not the word, whichis not imagined or induced? Is there such a silence, and is it possible to speakout of that silence?Q: The question was whether the words are coming from perception, from thesilence, or from the memory.K: Yes.Q: The question is whether the words that are used are communicating directlyand are coming out of the emptiness, out of the silence, or not.K: That is the real question.Q: As we used to say, like the drum which vibrates to the emptiness within.K: Yes. Are you satisfied by this answer, by what the others have said?Q: No.K: Then how do you find out?Q: The very words you are using deny the possibility of being satisfied and ofworking at it intellectually. It is something that has nothing to do with thosethings.K: Look, suppose I love you and trust you. Because I trust you and you trust me,whatever you say won’t be a lie and I know you won’t deceive me under anycircumstances. You won’t tell me something which is not actual to you.Q: I might do something out of ignorance.K: But say you trust me and I trust you. There is a relationship of trust,confidence, affection, love; like a man and a woman when they are married, theytrust each other. Now is that possible here? Because, as she points out, I candeceive myself with logic, with reason, with all these things. Millions ofpeople have done it. I can also see the danger of loving the priest: he can playhavoc with me.Q: If one has affection for someone, one projects all kinds of illusions ontohim.Q: I think the trust, the investigation, logic, and all that, go together withlove.K: That is a very dangerous thing too.Q: Isn’t there any way to avoid danger?K: I don’t want to be caught in an illusion.Q: So can we say that truth is in the silence out of which the teaching comes?K: But I want to know how the silence comes! I might invent it. I might haveworked to have a silent mind for years, conditioned it, kept it in a cage, andthen say, “Marvelous, I am silent.” There is that danger. Logic is a danger.Thought is a danger. So I see all the dangers around me. I am caught in allthese dangers and I want to find out if what that man is saying is the truth.Q: Are we saying that perception has to be pure and in the realm of silence—thereal realm of silence, not a fantasy—in order to be able to even come close tothis question?K: Dr. Bohm is a scientist, a physicist; he is clear-thinking, logical. Supposesomeone goes to him and asks, “Is what Krishnamurti says the truth?” How is hegoing to answer?Q: Doesn’t Dr. Bohm, or anybody, have to go beyond the limitations of logic?K: Somebody comes to him and asks, “Tell me, I really want to know from you,please tell me if that man is speaking the truth.”Q: But you are then saying use the instrument of logic to find out?K: No. I am very interested because I have heard so many people who areillogical and careless say he is speaking the truth. But I go to a seriousthinker, careful with the use of words, and ask, “Please tell me if he istelling the truth, not some crooked thing covered up.” How is he going to answerme?Q: The other day when that man said you may be caught in a rut, and you lookedat it, what happened then?K: I looked at it in several different ways and I don’t think I am caught in agroove, but yet I might be. So after examining it very carefully, I left it.Something takes place when you leave it alone after an examination; somethingnew comes into it.Now I am asking you: Please tell me if that man is speaking the truth.Q: For me it is a reality. I can’t communicate it to you. This is what I havefound out and you have to find it out for yourself. You have to test it in yourown mind.K: But you may be leading me up the garden path.Q: That is all I can say. I can’t really communicate it.K: You may be up the garden path yourself.Q: It seems to me I would want to know what he is bringing to bear on the answerto this question. Is it science? Is it logic? Is it his own intelligence? Iwould want to know out of what he was going to answer me.K: How do you in your heart of hearts, as a human being, know that he isspeaking the truth? I want to feel it. I object to logic and all that. I havebeen through that before. Therefore if all that is not the way, then what is?Q: There are people who are very clever, who speak of things which are verysimilar, who have grasped this intellectually very well and say they arespeaking from truth.K: Yes, they are repeating in India now: “You are the world.” That is the latestcatchword!Q: In order to communicate that, I have to speak out of the silence you werereferring to.K: No, please be simple with me. I want to know if Krishnamurti is speaking thetruth. Dr. Bohm has known Krishnamurti for several years. He has a good, trainedmind so I go to him and ask him.Q: All he can say is, “I know this man, this is how he affects me. He haschanged my life.” And suddenly a note may be struck in the other one.K: No. I want it straight from the horse’s mouth!Q: But you said you wanted proof.K: I don’t. It is a very serious question, it isn’t just a dramatic orintellectual question. This is a tremendous question.Q: Can one ever get an answer? Or is that person asking a false question tobegin with?K: Is he?Q: I think I could say to him that when we did discuss these things it was fromthe emptiness, and that I felt it was a direct perception.K: Yes. Is direct perception unrelated to logic?Q: It doesn’t come from logic.K: But you are logical all the same.Q: That may come later, not at that moment.K: So you are telling me: I have found out that man is telling the truth becauseI had a direct perception, an insight into what he is saying.Q: Yes.K: Now, be careful, because I have heard a disciple of some guru saying exactlythe same thing.Q: I have also heard a guru say this but a little later by looking at itlogically I saw the thing was nonsense. When I was looking at the fact and thelogic I saw that it did not fit. So I would say that in addition to directperception I have constantly examined this logically.K: So you are saying that perception has not blinded you and with thatperception goes logic also.Q: Yes, logic and fact.K: So perception first, then logic. Not first logic, then perception.Q: Yes. That is what it always has to be.K: So through perception and then with logic, you see that it is the truth.Hasn’t this been done by the devout Christians?Q: Logic is not enough, because we have to see how people actually behave aswell. I see that Christians say certain things, but when we look at the whole ofwhat they do it doesn’t fit.K: Isn’t there a terrible danger in this?Q: I am sure there is a danger.K: So you are now saying that one has to walk in danger.Q: Yes.K: Now I begin to understand what you are saying. One has to move in a fieldwhich is full of danger, full of snakes and pitfalls.Q: Which means one has to be tremendously awake.K: So I have learned from talking to him that this is a very dangerous thing. Hehas said you can only understand whether Krishnamurti is speaking the truth ifyou are really prepared to walk in a field which is full of pitfalls. Is thatright?Q: Yes.K: It is a field which is full of mines, the razor’s edge path. Are you preparedto do that? One’s whole being says, “Be secure.”Q: That is the only way to do anything.K: I have learned to be aware of the dangers around me and also to face dangerall the time and, therefore, to have no security. The inquirer might say, “Thisis too much,” and go away! So this is what I want to get at. Can the mind, whichhas been conditioned for centuries to be secure, abandon that and say, “I willwalk into danger”? That is what we are saying. It is logical, but in a sense itis illogical.Q: In principle that is the way all science works.K: Yes, that is right. So it also means I don’t trust anybody, any guru, anyprophet. I trust my wife because she loves me and I love her, but that isirrelevant.Q: The word danger has to be explained too. From one point it is dangerous, andfrom another it isn’t. I have to investigate. My conditioning is very dangerous.K: So we’re saying: “I have walked in danger and I have found the logic of thisdanger. Through the perception of the danger I have found the truth of whatKrishnamurti is saying. And there is no security, no safety in this, whereas allthe others give me safety.”Q: Security becomes the ultimate danger.K: Of course.Q: What you have described is actually the scientific approach. They say everystatement must be in danger of being false; it has been put that way.K: That is perfectly right. I have learned a lot. Have you? A man comes fromSeattle or Sheffield or Birmingham and is told, “I have found that what he saysis the truth because I have had a perception and that perception standslogically.” It is not outside of reason. And in that perception I see that whereI walk is full of pitfalls, of danger. Therefore, I have to be tremendouslyaware. Danger exists when there is no security. And the gurus, the priests, alloffer security. Seeing the illogic of it I accept this illogic too.Q: I am not sure that you should call it illogical. It is not illogical but itis the way logic has to work.K: Of course. Are we saying that direct perception, insight, and the working outof it demand great logic, a great capacity to think clearly? But the capacity tothink clearly will not bring about insight.Q: But if the logic does not bring about perception, what does it do exactly?K: It trains, it sharpens the mind. But that certainly won’t bring about aninsight.Q: It is not through the mind that the perception comes.K: That all depends on what you mean by the mind. Logic makes the mind sharp,clear, objective, and sane. But that won’t give you the other. Your question is:How does the other come about?QL: No. That was not my question. Logic clears the mind, but is the mind theinstrument of perception?Q2: Yes, that is what we said, that it clears the mind of contusion, of thedebris.QL: The debris may come if you don’t have logic.K: You might remain in the debris if you don’t have logic.Q: If the perception is a real perception and so the truth, why does it thenneed the discipline of logic to examine it?K: We said perception works out logically. It does not need logic. Whatever itdoes is reasonable, logical, sane, objective.Q: It is logical without an intent to make it so.K: That’s it.Q: It is like saying that if you see what is in this room correctly, you willnot find anything illogical in what you see.K: All right. Will the perception keep the confusion, the debris, away all thetime so that the mind never accumulates it and doesn’t have to keep clearing itaway? That was your question, wasn’t it?Q: I think perception can reach the stage at which it is continually keeping thefield clear. I say that it can reach that stage for a certain moment.K: At a certain moment I have perception. But during the interval between theperceptions there is a lot of debris being gathered. Our question is: Isperception continuous so that there is no collection of the debris? Put it roundthe other way: Does one perception keep the field clear?Q: Can one make a difference between insight and perception?K: Don’t break it up yet. Take those two words as synonymous. We are asking: Isperception from time to time, with intervals? During those intervals a lot ofdebris collects and, therefore, the field has to be swept again. Or doesperception in itself bring about tremendous clarity in which there is no debris?Q: Are you saying that once it happens it will be there forever?K: That is what I am trying to get at. Don’t use the words continuous, neveragain. Keep to the question of whether, once perception has taken place, themind can collect further debris, confusion. It is only when that perceptionbecomes darkened by the debris that the process of getting rid of it begins. Butif there is perception why should there be a collecting, gathering?Ojai, California, 22 March, 1977"},{"pageContent":"2 KRISHNAMURTI: We were asking how one can know that what Krishnamurti is sayingis true. He might be caught in his own conditioning, illusions, and not beingable to free himself from them, have put together a series of observations,words, and calls them truth. How do you know whether what he is saying isactual, truthful, and lasting?Dr. Bohm said that when one has an insight, a direct perception into what isbeing said, then there is no doubt that it is the truth. Having that insight youcan work it out logically to show that the perception is true. But is thatperception brief, only to be had at intervals and, therefore, gathering a lot ofdebris—those things that block perception—or is one perception enough? Does itopen the door so that there is insight all the time?QUESTIONER: Does that mean that you would never have any confusion?K: Yes, we came to that point. One has a perception, an insight, and thatinsight has its own capacity for reason, logic, and action. That action iscomplete, because the perception is complete for the moment. Will further actionconfuse perception? Or, having perception, is there no further confusion?Q: I think we were saying that there is danger in this. If you say, “My actionis always right—”K: Oh, that is dangerous!Q: We also said that logic has its danger. One could think one has an insightwhen one has not.K: Suppose I have the capacity to reason it out and act and then say: That is aperfect, complete action. Some people who read the Gita act according to it andthey call that insight. Their action is patterned after their reading. They saythis action is complete. I have heard many of them say this, as do Catholics andProtestants who are completely immersed in the Bible. So we are treading on verydangerous ground and, therefore, are greatly aware of it.Q: You also said that the mind tries to find security in all this.K: The mind has always been seeking security and when that security isthreatened it tries to find security in insight, in direct perception.Q: In the illusion of insight.K: Yes, but it makes the insight into security. The next question is: Must therebe a constant breaking of perception? That is, one day one sees very clearly,one has direct perception; then that fades away and there is confusion. Thenagain there is a perception and an action, followed by confusion, and so on. Isthat so? Or is there no further confusion after these deep insights?Q: Are we saying this perception is whole?K: Yes, if the perception is complete, whole, then there is no confusion at anytime. Or, one may deceive oneself that it is whole and act upon it, which bringsconfusion.Q: There is also a possible danger that one has a genuine perception, aninsight, and is not fooling oneself, and that out of that comes a certainaction. But then one could fall into making whatever that action was into aformula and stop having the insight. Let’s say that out of an insight which wasreal a certain action came. One then thinks that is the way things should be.K: That is what generally happens.Q: But isn’t that a corruption of the perception, just making a pattern out ofthe action instead of continuing to look? It is like being able to really lookat something; for instance, looking out of the window and seeing something. Butthen you don’t look out again and you think everything is the way it was. It mayhave totally changed. The perception starts out being genuine, but you don’tcontinue to look, have insight.K: Yes. Scientists may have an insight in some specialized field and thatinsight is put into a category of science unrelated to their lives. But we aretalking of a perception that is not only in the field of action but also indaily life.Q: As a whole and so there is a continuity.K: Yes.Q: But I still don’t think we have gone into the question of danger. You saidthat one day a man came to you and said maybe you were stuck in a groove.K: Yes, caught in a rut.Q: You didn’t say immediately, “I know I am not because I have had a perfectinsight.”K: Ah, that would be deadly!Q: But rather, you said you looked at it for several days.K: Of course.Q: I am trying to find out what we are driving at. Perhaps we are saying thatthere may be an insight which never goes back into confusion. But we are notsaying there is one.K: Yes, that’s right. Now would you say that when there is completeperception—not an illusory perception—there is no further confusion?Q: It seems reasonable to say that.K: That means from day to day there is no confusion at all.Q: Then why did you feel it necessary to look into it?K: Because I may deceive myself. Therefore, it is dangerous ground and I must bealert, I must watch it.Q: Are we seeing as an insight now that when there is an insight of that kindthere is no further confusion? But we may deceive ourselves nevertheless.K: Yes. Therefore, we must be watchful.Q: Do you mean after the real insight you could then deceive yourself?K: No. You have a deep insight, complete, whole. Someone comes along and says:“Look, you are deceiving yourself.” Do you instantly say, “No, I am notdeceiving myself because my perception was complete”? Or do you listen and lookat it all afresh? It doesn’t mean that you are denying the complete perception;you are again watching if it is real or illusory.Q: That is not necessarily an intellectual process?K: No, no. I would say both. It is intellectual as well as nonverbal.Q: Is perception something that is always there and it is only that we—K: That leads to dangerous ground. The Hindus say that God is always thereinside you, the abiding deep divinity, or soul, or Atman. and it is covered up.Remove the confusion, the debris, and it is found inside. Most people believethat. I think that is a conclusion. You conclude that there is something divineinside, a soul, the Atman, or whatever you like to call it. And from aconclusion you can never have a total, complete perception.Q: But this leads to another problem, because if you deny that, then what makesone step out of the stream? Does it mean that the stepping out is for certainindividuals only?K: When you say “certain individuals” I think you are putting the wrongquestion, aren’t you?Q: No. If the possibility exists for everyone—K: Yes, the possibility exists for human beings.Q: For the totality?K: For human beings.Q: Then there is some energy, which—K: Which is outside of them or which is in them.Q: Yes. We don’t know.K: Therefore, don’t come to any conclusion. If from a conclusion you think youperceive, then that perception is conditioned; therefore, it is not whole.Q: Does that mean that there would not be the possibility of a deepening ofperception?K: You can’t deepen insight. You can’t deepen perception. You perceive thewhole, that’s all.Q: What do you mean then by saying there was this mind into which you couldcontinually go more deeply?K: That is something else.Q: Are you saying that perception, if it is partial, is not perception?K: Of course, obviously not.Q: You mentioned watchfulness after perception.K: What happened was that a man came up to me and said, “You are getting old,you are stuck in a groove.” And I listened to it. For a couple of days I thoughtabout it. I looked at it and said to myself, “He may be right.”Q: You are almost suggesting that it could be possible.K: No, I wanted to examine it. Not say it could or could not.Q: To be caught in habit after a perception, could that not ever happen again,at certain levels?K: There is partial perception and total perception; let’s divide it into thosetwo. When there is total perception, there is no further confusion.Q: You don’t get caught in habit?K: There is no further confusion. Because it is so.Q: What if something happens to the brain physically?K: Then of course it is gone.Q: So there seems to be a limitation to what you say, because one assumes thatthe brain remains healthy.K: Of course, it assumes that the whole organism is healthy. If there is anaccident, your brain suffers concussion and something is injured, then it isfinished.Q: The major danger is that we would mistake a partial perception for the total.K: One has to go into the question of what perception is. How do you come to it?That is very important, isn’t it? You cannot have perception if your daily lifeis in disorder, confused, contradictory. That is obvious.Q: Doesn’t this perception mean that there is constant renewal?K: No. Is that energy outside or inside? She is asking that question all thetime.Q: Isn’t outside and inside an artificial division? Is that a real thing, or isit just an illusion?K: She said that this perception needs energy. That energy may be an externalenergy, a mechanical energy, or a nonmechanistic energy which may exist deeplyinside you. Both are mental concepts. Would you agree to that? Both areconclusions which one has either accepted because tradition has said so, or onehas come to that conclusion by oneself. Any form of conclusion is detrimental toperception. So what does perception mean? Can I have perception if I am attachedto my position, to my wife, to my property?Q: It colors the act of perceiving.K: Yes, but take the scientists. They have their families, their attachments;they want position, money, and all the rest of it, but they have an insight.Q: It is not total.K: So we are saying that total perception can only take place when in your dailylife there is no confusion.Q: May we look more closely into that, because couldn’t it be that a totalperception can take place in spite of that and wipe it away?K: I can see if the windows are not clean my view is confused.Q: Would that mean that there is a conditioned insight?K: If I am in fear, my perception will be very partial. That is a fact.Q: But don’t you need perception to end fear?K: Ah, but in investigating fear I have a total perception of fear.Q: Surely if there is fear or attachment, even one’s logic would be distorted.K: One is frightened; as we said, that distorts perception. But ininvestigating, observing, going into fear, understanding it profoundly, indelving into it, I have perception.Q: Are you implying that there are certain things you can do which will make forperceptions, which means although you have fear and it distorts, the distortionis not so total that you cannot investigate it. There is still that possibility,although you are distorting through fear?K: I realize that I am distorting perception through fear.Q: That’s right, then I begin to look at fear.K: I investigate it, look into it.Q: In the beginning I am also distorting it.K: Therefore, I am watching every distortion. I am aware of every distortionthat is going on.Q: But you see, I think the difficulty lies there. How can I investigate when Iam distorting?K: Wait, just listen. I am afraid and I see fear has made me do something thatis a distortion.Q: But before I can see that, the fear has to fade away.K: No, I am observing fear.Q: But I cannot observe fear if I am afraid.K: Take a fact—that you are afraid. You are conscious of it. That means that youbecome aware of the fact that there is fear. And you observe also what that fearhas done. Is that clear?Q: Yes.K: And you look more and more into it. In looking very deeply into it you havean insight.Q: I may have an insight.K: No, you will have insight, which is quite different.Q: What you are saying is that this confusion due to fear is not complete, thatit is always open to mankind to have insight.K: To one who is investigating, who is observing.Q: If you try to investigate something else while you are afraid, you get lostin fear. But it is still open to you to investigate fear.K: Yes, quite right. One suffers and sees what it does. In observing it,investigating it, opening it up, in the very unrolling of it you have a certaininsight. That is all we are saying. That insight may be partial. Therefore, onehas to be aware that it is partial. Its action is partial and it may appearcomplete, so watch it.Q: Very often it looks as if it is totally impossible to have an insight, sinceyou say, “If you are distorting how will you look?” But you are also sayingthat, as a matter of fact, when you have a distortion, the one thing you canlook at is the distortion.K: That’s right.Q: That factually you have that capacity.K: One has that capacity.Q: You can look at that. The fear which creates the distortion can be looked at;so you can’t say that no perception whatsoever is possible.K: That’s just it, then you have locked the door.Q: Could one say that the fear can look at itself?K: No, no. One is afraid. In looking at that fear—not having an insight, justwatching it—you see what it does, what its action is.Q: You mean by looking, being aware of it.K: Without any choosing, being aware. And you see what fear does. In looking atit more extensively, deeply, widely, suddenly you have an insight into the wholestructure of fear.Q: But still, in that moment of fear, I am fear.K: How you observe fear matters; whether you observe it as an observer or theobserver is that. You perceive that the observer is the observed, and in thisaction there is distortion, confusion. And you examine that confusion, which isborn of fear, and in the very process of examination you have an insight. Do it,you will see it—if you don’t limit yourself; in saying, “I am too frightened, Ican’t look,” you run away from it.Q: To simplify it perhaps too much, when we said one can’t see through thewindow because it is dirty and it distorts, the action of examining the fear,the distorting factor, is the cleansing of the window.K: How you observe, how you investigate, that is the real thing. That is,perception can take place only when there is no division between the observerand the observed. Perception can take place only in the very act of exploring.To explore implies that there is no division between the observer and theobserved. Therefore, you are watching the movement of fear and in the verywatching of it there is an insight. I think that is clear.And yet you see, Krishnamurti says, “I have never done this.”Q: Never gone through all this? Then how do you know somebody else can?K: That’s just it. Let’s discuss it. Suppose you have not gone through all this,but you see it instantly. Because you see it instantly, your capacity to reasonexplains all this. Another listens and says, “I’d like to get that.” I don’thave to go through that whole process.Q: Are you saying that all we have been discussing just now is merely a pointerto something else? We don’t have to go through all that.K: Yes. I want to get at that.Q: In other words, that helps to clear the ground in some way?K: Yes.Q: It is not really the main point.K: No.Q: Are you saying there is a shortcut?K: No, no shortcut. Must you go through fear, jealousy, anxiety, attachment? Orcan you clear the whole thing instantly? Must one go through all this process?Q: You previously said that you have never done this. And by having thatimmediate total perception you are able to see what those with the dirty windowscan do to clean them. But that isn’t necessary; there is perhaps a direct, animmediate, way for those who haven’t—K: No. First put the question, see what comes out of it. Dr. Bohm says toKrishnamurti, “You have probably not gone through all this. Because you have adirect, a total, insight you can argue with reason, with logic; you can act. Youare always talking from that total perception; therefore, what you say can neverbe distorted.” And another listens to all this and says: “I am frightened, I amjealous, I am this, I am that, and, therefore, I can’t have total perception.”So I observe attachment, or fear, or jealousy, and I have an insight.Is it possible through investigating, through awareness and discovering that theobserver is the observed and that there is no division, in the very process ofinvestigation—in which we are observing without the observer and see thetotality of it—is it possible to free all the rest? I think that is the onlyway.Q: Is it possible not to have certain fears, jealousy, attachment? Could that bepart of one’s conditioning if one were raised in a certain way, or went to acertain school?K: But there may be deeper layers. You may not be totally conscious of them, youmay not be totally aware of the deeper fears. You may say, “Superficially I amall right, I have none of these things.”Q: But if one went to a certain school, would the kind of learning andinvestigation that would take place in such a school clear the way toward thepossibility?K: Obviously. What we are talking about is whether one must go through all thisprocess.Q: Couldn’t we remove from the problem the personal aspect? We are discussingwhat is open to mankind rather than to any individual.K: Yes. Is it open to any human being without going through all this process?Q: By “this process,” do you mean involvement with the fear?K: With fear, sorrow, jealousy, attachment. Must you go through all that, stepby step, or can a human being see the whole thing at a glance? And that veryglance is the investigation and the complete, total perception?Q: Which is what you mean when you say the first step is the last.K: Yes, total perception.Q: Then what would one’s responsibility be toward someone who is in sorrow?K: The response to that human being is the response of compassion. That’s all.Nothing else.Q: For instance, if you see an injured bird, it is very easy to deal with thatbecause it really doesn’t require very much of you. But when you come intocontact with a human being, he has a much more complex set of needs.K: What can you do actually? Somebody comes to you and says, “I am in deepsorrow.” Do you talk to them out of compassion, or from a conclusion, or out ofyour own particular experience of sorrow, which has conditioned you? Do youanswer according to your conditioning? A Hindu who is conditioned in a certainway says, “My dear friend, I am so sorry, but in the next life you will livebetter. You suffered because you did this and that,” and so on. Or a Christianwould respond from some other conclusion. And he takes comfort in it. Because aman who is suffering wants some sort of solace, someone on whose lap he can puthis head. So what he is seeking is comfort and avoidance of this terrible pain.Will you offer him any of those escapes? Whatever comes out of compassion willhelp him.Q: Are you saying that as far as sorrow is concerned you can’t directly helpanyone, but the energy of compassion itself may be of help?K: That’s right; that’s all.Q: But many such wounded spirits will come and I think it is going to be aproblem to know how to deal with them.K: There is no problem if you are compassionate. Compassion doesn’t createproblems. It has no problems; therefore, it is compassionate.Q: You are saying that total compassion is the highest intelligence?K: Of course. If there is compassion, that compassion has its own intelligenceand that intelligence acts. But if you have no compassion and no intelligence,then your conditioning makes you reply according to whatever another wants. Ithink that is fairly simple.To go back to the other question, must a human being go through the wholeprocess? Has no human being said, “I won’t go through all this; I absolutelyrefuse to go through all this”?Q: But on what basis does one refuse? It wouldn’t make sense to refuse to dowhat is necessary.K: Of course. You see, we are such creatures of habit. Because my father isconditioned, generations after generations are conditioned, and I amconditioned. And I accept it; I work in it and I operate with it. But if I say,“I won’t ever operate in my conditioned responses,” something else may takeplace. Then, if I realize I am a bourgeois, I don’t want to become an aristocrator a militant, I refuse to be a bourgeois, which doesn’t mean I become arevolutionary, or join Lenin or Marx; those are all bourgeois to me. Sosomething does take place. I reject the whole thing. You see, a human beingnever says, “I will reject the whole thing.” I want to investigate that.Q: Do you mean that even to say, “I am going to get rid of the whole thing,” isnot necessary?K: Of course. I mean saying, “I won’t be a bourgeois,” is just words.Q: But isn’t the key to this somewhere in desire? There is some sort of desirefor continuity, for security.K: That’s right. Bourgeois implies continuity, security, it implies belonging tosomething, a lack of taste, vulgarity, all that.Q: But Krishnaji, if you are saying that Krishnamurti never said this, never hadthe need to say it, we can only conclude that you are some kind of freak.K: No, no. You can say he is a freak, but it doesn’t answer the question.Krishnamurti says, “I have not touched all this.” Somebody asks, “Why should Igo through all this?” Don’t say Krishnamurti is a freak, but how it happens.Q: In saying, “I won’t be a bourgeois,” you are discovering it in yourself.K: No, no. That is a different matter. If somebody says to you, “I have neverbeen through all this,” what do you do? Do you say he is a freak? Or would yousay, “How extraordinary; is he telling the truth? Has he deceived himself?” Youdiscuss with him. Then your question is, “How does it happen?” You are a humanbeing, he is a human being; you want to find out.Q: You ask in what way we are different. He is a human being that has never beenthrough all that, and yet he points out.K: No, he has never been through it. Don’t say he points out. Don’t you ask thatquestion: “How does it happen; must I go through all this?” Do you ask that?Q: You are taking two widely separate things. One is the uncontaminated personwho never had to go through the process because he was never in the soup.K: Leave out why he didn’t go through it.Q: But most other people, apparently, are in some form of—K: Conditioning—Q: —in some form of contamination—it may be fear or something else. Therefore,the person who has already got this sickness—let’s call it that—says “This manhas never been sick for a day in his life.” What good is it to examine that,because one is already sick in some form.Q: The question is, how can a human being who is sick in some way get out of itdirectly without going through endless self-exploration?K: Can we put the whole thing differently? Do you seek excellence, notexcellence, for instance, in a building, but the essence of excellence? Theneverything falls away, doesn’t it? Or do you seek excellence in a certaindirection and never the essence of excellence? As an artist I seek excellence inmy painting and get caught in that. A scientist gets caught in something else.But an ordinary human being, not a specialist, just an average intelligent humanbeing who does not take drugs, does not smoke, is fairly intelligent and decent;if he sought the essence of excellence, would this happen? The essence wouldmeet all this. I wonder if I am conveying something?Q: Does it exist apart from this manifestation?K: Listen carefully first. Don’t object or reject and say if and but. That verydemand for excellence, how you demand it, brings the essence of it. You demandit passionately. You demand the highest intelligence, the highest excellence,the essence of it, and when fear arises, then you—Q: Where does the demand come from?K: Demand it! Don’t say, “Where does it come from?” There may be a motive, butthe very demand washes it all away. I wonder if I am conveying anything?Q: You are saying to demand this excellence, which we don’t know.K: I don’t know what is beyond it, but I want to be morally excellent.Q: Does that mean goodness?K: I demand the excellence of goodness, I demand the excellent flower ofgoodness. In that very demand there is a demand for the essence.Q: Does perception come from this demand?K: Yes, that’s right.Q: Could you go into what you call this demand?K: It is not a demand which means asking, a demand that means imploring,wanting. Cut out all those.Q: It doesn’t mean those?K: No, no.Q: But then you are back with prayer.K: Oh, no. Leave out all that.Q: YOU are really saying that the impossible is possible to the averageintelligent human being?K: We are saying that, yes, which is not a conclusion, which is not a hope. Isay it is possible for the average human being, who is fairly clean, who isfairly decent, fairly kind, who is not a bourgeois.Q: Traditionally we are conditioned to believe that there are special peoplewith no conscious content of consciousness, so it is very difficult for someonelike me to feel that one could really be completely free of it.K: You see, you have not listened. I says to you, please listen first, don’tbring in all these objections. Just listen to what he is saying. That is, whatis important in life is the supreme excellence, which has its own essence.That’s all. And to demand does not mean begging or praying, getting somethingfrom somebody.Q: The point is, we find we confuse demand with desire.K: Of course.Q: There must be no beliefs.K: No beliefs, no desire.Q: You see, when people feel that they want to give up desire then there is adanger of giving up this demand as well.K: How can we put this? Let’s find a good word for it. Would the word passion besuitable? There is passion for this, passion for excellence.Q: Does it imply that this passion has no object?K: You see how you immediately form a conclusion. Burning passion, not forsomething. The communists are passionate about their ideas. That passion isvery, very petty and limited. The Christians have passion for missionary work;that passion is born of the love of Jesus. That again is not passion, it is verynarrow. Putting all that aside, I say, “Passion!”Q: As you were just saying, people have had some vision, or a dream ofsomething, and that has developed a great energy. But you are saying it is not adream, it is not a vision, but it is nevertheless some perception of thisexcellence.K: All those passions feed the ego, feed the “me,” make “me” important,consciously or unconsciously. We are cutting out all that. There is a young boywho has a passion to grow up into an extraordinary human being, into somethingoriginal.Q: He sees that it is possible.K: Yes.Q: And, therefore, he has the passion.K: Yes, that’s right. It is possible. Is that what is missing in most humanbeings? Not passion, but the welling up of … I don’t know how to put it. Thereis this passion in a human being who demands the supreme excellence, not in whathe writes in his books, but the feeling of it. You know this, don’t you? Thatmay shatter everything else. Again, that human being didn’t demand it. He says,“I never even asked for it.”Q: Perhaps that is due to conditioning. We are conditioned to mediocrity, not tomake this demand. That is what you mean by mediocrity.K: Yes, of course. Mediocrity is lack of great passion—not for Jesus, or forMarx, or whatever it is.Q: We are not only conditioned to mediocrity but to direction, so the demand isalways to have some direction.K: The demand is a direction, quite right.Q: To have a demand without any direction—K: That’s right. I like the word demand because it is a challenge.Q: Doesn’t a demand without direction imply that it is not in time?K: Of course. It demands no direction, no time, no person. So, does totalinsight bring this passion? Total insight is the passion.Q: They can’t be separate.K: Total insight is the flame of passion that wipes away all confusion. It burnsaway everything else. Don’t you then act as a magnet? The bees go toward thenectar. In the same way don’t you act as a magnet when you are passionate tocreate? Is it that there is this lack of fire? That may be the thing that ismissing. If there is something missing, I would ask for it.Q1: Could we talk about the relationship between the conditioned and theunconditioned mind, and whether it is only possible to ask for small things, orcan we somehow leap beyond that into something bigger?Q2: Whatever the “me” asks for, the asking in a direction is the small thing.K: Quite right.Q: We have to ask for the unlimited, for the unconditioned.K: She is really asking what the relationship is between the conditioned and theunconditioned. Also, what is the relationship between two human beings when oneis unconditioned and the other is not? There is no relationship.Q: How can you say that there is no relationship between the unconditioned andthe conditioned human being?K: There is no relationship from the conditioned to the unconditioned. But theunconditioned has a relationship to the other.Q: But logically one could ask if there is an essential difference between theunconditioned and the conditioned. Because if you say there is, then there isduality.K: What do you mean by essential difference?Q: Let’s say difference in kind. If there is an essential difference between theconditioned and the unconditioned there is duality.K: I see what you mean. X is conditioned, Y is not conditioned. X thinks interms of duality, his very conditioning is duality. But duality has norelationship with Y, yet Y has a relationship with X.Q: Because there is no duality.K: Yes. Y has no duality; therefore, there is a relationship. You also askedanother question: Essentially, deeply, is there a difference? Are not both thesame?Q: Could one ask the question in another way? Is the conditioning onlysuperficial?K: No. Then we are lost.Q: The world couldn’t be unconditioned, could it?K: The world is “me” and “I” am the world.Q: That is an absolute fact only to the unconditioned.K: Oh, not at all. Be careful, it is so. It is an obvious fact.Q: You mean that only the unconditioned can perceive that?K: I am refuting it. I say it isn’t quite like that.Q: I mean it in the sense that I may say, “I am the world, the world is me,” butI revert to an action that is a contradiction to that. Therefore, it is not anabsolute fact for me. There may be moments when the fact of it is seen by me.K: Yes. Do you mean: I say to myself very clearly, “I am the world and the worldis me”?Q: I see it.K: I feel it.Q: I feel it, yes.K: And I act contrary to that, which is, I act personally, selfishly—”my,” “me.”That is a contradiction to the fact that the world is me and I am the world. Aperson can say this merely as an intellectual conclusion, or a momentaryfeeling.Q: It is not an intellectual conclusion, because I am stating my position, but Iaccept that for you the position is totally different.K: No, you don’t even have to accept that. See the fact, which is, when onesays, “I am the world and the world is me,” there is no me. But one’s house hasto be insured; I may have children; I have to earn a living. But there is no me.See the importance of it. There is no me all the time. I function, but there isno me which is seeking a higher position and all that. Though I am married, I amnot attached, I don’t depend on a wife or husband. The appearances may give youthe impression that the me is operating, but actually, to a man who feels, “Theworld is me and I am the world,” to him there is no me. To you, looking at him,there is. That human being lives in this world, he must have food, clothes andshelter, a job, transportation, all that, yet there is no me.So when the world is me and I am the world, there is no me. Can that state, thatquality operate in all directions? It must operate in all directions. When yousay, “I am the world and the world is me,” and there is no me, there is noconditioning. Then I don’t put the question: In that unconditioned state doesthe conditioned exist? When a human being says, “I am the world and the world isme,” there is no I.Q: Therefore, the other person also is not there. There is no you.K: There is no me, there is no you. When you ask if the conditioned exists inthis state you are asking a wrong question. That is what I was getting at.Because when there is no I there is no you.Q: The question is: How does that person see the kind of confusion that arisesaround “I” and “you”? He sees what is going on in the world, that people aregenerally confused about this.K: I exist; there is you and me. And you also think the same thing. So we keepthis division everlastingly. But when you and I really realize, have profoundinsight, that the world is me and I am the world, there is no me.Q: There is no me and no you. No means everything.K: The world of living, everything.Q: Then the question whether there is an essential difference between this andthat, the unconditioned and the conditioned, doesn’t arise because there is no“between.”K: Yes, that’s right. There is no “you,” there is no “I” in that state, whichdoesn’t include the conditioned state. Is this too abstract?Q: Why do you have to say, “I am the world” first, and then deny this?K: Because it is an actuality.Q: But then you imply that the “I” is still there if I say, “I am the world.”K: That is merely a statement. It is an actual fact that I am the world.Q: Whatever I mean by the word I, I also mean by the word world.K: Yes.Q: So we don’t need those two words.K: Yes, you and I, remove that.Q: There is just everything.K: No, this is very dangerous. If you say I am everything—Q: I am trying to find out what you mean by “the world.”K: If you say, “I am everything,” then the murderer, the assassin, is part ofme.Q: Suppose I say, “I am the world” instead, does that change it?K: [laughing] All right. I see the actual fact that I am the result of theworld. The world means killing, wars, the whole of society. I am the result ofthat.Q: And I see everybody is the result of that.K: Yes. I am saying the result is “I” and “you.”Q: And that separation.K: When I say, “I am the world,” I am saying all that.Q: You mean to say I am generated by the world, I am identified with everything.K: Yes. I am the product of the world.Q: The world is the essence of what I am.K: Yes. I am the essence of the world. It is the same thing. When there is adeep perception of that, not verbal, not intellectual, not emotional, notromantic, but profound, there is no you or me. I think that holds logically. Butthere is a danger. If I say, “The world is me, I am everything,” I’ll accepteverything.Q: You are really saying that one is the product of the whole of society.K: Yes.Q: But I am also of the essence of the whole of society.K: Yes. I am really the essential result of all this.Q: Does it help to use the word ego?K: It is the same thing, it doesn’t matter. You see, when you say “me,” or“ego,” there is a possibility of deception that the “I” is the very essence ofGod. You know about that superstition.Q: The Atman.K: Yes.Q: But there is still another question. Is the unconditioned mind also a productof all this? Then we come to a contradiction.K: No, there is no contradiction. Without using the word I, it can be said theresult of the world is this. The result of the world is that also. We are twohuman beings, which means the result has created the “I” and the “you.” Whenthere is an insight into the result there is no “result.”Q: The result changes and vanishes when we see it.K: That means there is no result. Therefore, “you” and “I” don’t exist. That isan actual fact for a man who says, “I am not the result.” You see what it means?There is no causation in the mind and, therefore, there is no effect. Therefore,it is whole, and any action born of it is causeless and without effect.Q: You have to make that clear, in the sense that you still use cause and effectconcerning ordinary, mechanical things.K: Quite. This human being, X, is a result. And Y is a result. X says, “I,” andY says, “I”; therefore, there is “you” and “I.” X says, “I see this,” andinvestigates, goes into it, and he has an insight. In that insight the tworesults cease. Therefore, in that state there is no cause.Q: There is no cause and no effect although it may leave a residue in the mind.K: Let’s go into it. In that state there is no result, no cause, no effect. Thatmind acts out of compassion. Therefore, there is no result.Q: But in some sense it would look as if there were a result.K: But compassion has no result. A is suffering; he says to X, “Please help meto get out of my suffering.” If X really has compassion his words have noresult.Q: Something happens, but there is no result.K: That’s it.Q: But I think people generally are seeking a result.K: Yes. Let’s put it another way. Does compassion have a result? When there isresult there is cause. When compassion has a cause then you are no longercompassionate.Q: But compassion also acts.K: Compassion is compassion, it doesn’t act. If it acts because there is a causeand an effect, then it is not compassion: it wants a result.Q: It acts purely.K: It wants a result.Q: What makes it want a result is the idea of separation. Somebody says, “Thereis a person suffering, I would like to produce the result that he is notsuffering.” But that is based on the idea that there is “me” and “he.”K: That’s it.Q: There is no “he” and no “I.” There is no room, no place, to have this result.K: It is a tremendous thing! One has to look at it very, very carefully. Look,the world is me and I am the world. When I say “me,” “you” exist; both of us arethere. The “you” and the “I” are the results of man’s misery, of selfishness,and so on; it is a result. When one looks into the result, goes into it very,very deeply, the insight brings about a quality in which “you” and “I”—who arethe result—don’t exist. This is easy to agree to verbally, but when you see itdeeply there is no “you” and no “me.” Therefore, there is no result; which meanscompassion. The person upon whom that compassion acts wants a result. We say,“Sorry, there is no result.” But the man who suffers says, “Help me to get outof this,” or, “Help me to bring back my son, my wife.” He is demanding a result.This thing has no result. The result is the world.Q: Does compassion affect the consciousness of man?K: Yes. It affects the deep layers of consciousness. The “I” is the result ofthe world; the “you” is the result of the world. And to the man who sees thisdeeply, with a profound insight, there is no “you” or “I.” Therefore, thatprofound insight is compassion, which is intelligence. And the intelligencesays, if you want a result I can’t give it to you, I am not the product of aresult. Compassion says, this state is not a result; therefore, there is nocause.Q: Does that mean there is no time either?K: No cause, no result, no time.Ojai, California, March 24, 1977"},{"pageContent":"PART 4YOU ARE THE WORLD [index_split_001.html#filepos6071] In the last two decades of his life, Krishnamurti continued to divide his timebetween India, Europe, and the United States, giving public talks, holdingdialogues with small groups, and meeting with individuals. An extremelyimportant feature of this period were the gatherings at Saanen, in Switzerland.Held for twenty-five consecutive years, these were perhaps the strongestinternational focus of his work.Krishnamurti’s life for over sixty years was always public; except for briefperiods of illness and withdrawal for rest, his talks and meetings continueduntil his death in Ojai, California, in February 1986. In all that time themessage of his talks was in essence as it had been in the early years: Truth isa pathless land; each of us represents all humanity and one needs to be a lightto oneself, free of all authority. In conveying these teachings, Krishnamurtiexplored the abiding themes of thought, time, suffering, death, space, silence,and the sacred. In his talks and writings too, he touched, sometimes almostreluctantly because it might become stimulation or escape, on the innerwellspring of his life’s work.Krishnamurti provided a religious language that was extremely appropriate forthe twentieth century. Ranging from the poetic to the meticulously precise, thislanguage conveys nuances and insights for which previously accepted “mystical”language was frequently inadequate. From the beginning of his life until theend, his talks—remarkable in their range and universality—were always a processof joint exploration.When Mary Lutyens, one of Krishnamurti’s biographers, asked him to convey thecore of his message, he did so, and this one page summation, The Core ofKrishnamurti’s Teaching, begins the final part of the book. It is followed byselections from public talks given in Ojai, California; Saanen, Switzerland;Brockwood Park, England; New Delhi; and Washington, D.C.This part of the book expresses the work of the final decade of his long life.The themes are quintessentially what they have been since the outset; there is,however, an evolution of expression, which underpins the relevance ofKrishnamurti’s teachings for all time."},{"pageContent":"THE CORE OF KRISHNAMURTI’S TEACHING [index_split_001.html#filepos6235] The core of Krishnamurti’s teaching is contained in the statement he made in1929 when he said “Truth is a pathless land.” Man cannot come to it through anyorganization, through any creed, through any dogma, priest, or ritual, northrough any philosophical knowledge or psychological technique. He has to findit through the mirror of relationship, through the understanding of the contentsof his own mind, through observation, and not through intellectual analysis orintrospective dissection. Man has built in himself images as a sense ofsecurity—religious, political, personal. These manifest as symbols, ideas,beliefs. The burden of these dominates man’s thinking, relationships, and dailylife. These are the causes of our problems, for they divide man from man inevery relationship. His perception of life is shaped by the concepts alreadyestablished in his mind. The content of his consciousness is this consciousness.This content is common to all humanity. The individuality is the name, the form,and superficial culture he acquires from his environment. The uniqueness of theindividual does not lie in the superficial but in the total freedom from thecontent of consciousness.Freedom is not a reaction; freedom is not choice. It is man’s pretense thatbecause he has choice he is free. Freedom is pure observation without motive;freedom is not at the end of the evolution of man, but lies in the first step ofhis existence. In observation one begins to discover the lack of freedom.Freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence.Thought is time. Thought is born of experience, of knowledge, which areinseparable from time. Time is the psychological enemy of man. Our action isbased on knowledge and, therefore, time, so man is always a slave to the past.When man becomes aware of the movement of his own consciousness he will see thedivision between the thinker and the thought, the observer and the observed, theexperiencer and the experience. He will discover that this division is anillusion. Then only is there pure observation, which is insight without anyshadow of the past. This timeless insight brings about a deep radical change inthe mind.Total negation is the essence of the positive. When there is negation of allthose things which are not love—desire, pleasure—then love is, with itscompassion and intelligence.London, October 21, 1980"},{"pageContent":"TOTAL ACTION WITHOUT REGRET [index_split_001.html#filepos6407]"},{"pageContent":"1 Thought has created this world, the world of politics, the world of economics,the world of business, of social morality and all the religious structures. Allour problems and all our desires to find answers to problems are within thatconsciousness, within the field that thought has created. So thought is tryingto find answers to the mess it has made in our personal relationships, in ourrelationship with the community. Even your meditations, even your gods, yourChrists, and your Buddhas are the creations of thought, which is matter, whichcan only operate within the field of time. We think that through thought,through will, through ambition, through drive and aggression, throughsubstituting new religions for the old traditions, we can solve all the problemsof personal relationship.Is there an answer to all the problems through the operation of thought? Ifthought will give no answer to all the problems, then what will?What is consciousness? What is the operation of thought? All your meditationsare in that area; all your pursuits of pleasure, fear, greed, envy, brutality,violence, are within that field. And thought is always endeavoring to go beyondthat, asserting the ineffable, the unnamable, unknowable. The content ofconsciousness is consciousness. Your consciousness or another’s consciousness isits content. If it is born in India, then all the traditions, superstitions,hopes, fears, sorrows, anxieties, violence, sexual demands, aggression, thebeliefs, dogmas, and creeds of that country are the content of itsconsciousness. Yet the content of consciousness is extraordinarily similar,whether one is born in the East or in the West.Look at your own consciousness, if you can. If you are brought up in a religiousculture as a Christian, you believe in saviors, rituals, creeds, and dogmas onone side and, on the other side, you accept social immorality, wars,nationalities and their divisions that restrict economic expansion and denyconsideration for others. The content of your consciousness is your personalunhappiness, your ambitions, your fears, your greeds, your aggressiveness, yourdemands, your loneliness, your sorrow, your lack of relationship with another,the isolation, frustration, confusion, misery. All that is consciousness whetheryou are of the East or the West—with variations, with joys, with more knowledgeor less knowledge. Without that content, there is no consciousness as we knowit.All education is based on the acquiring of more knowledge, more information, butfunctioning always within this area. Any political reformation based on a newphilosophy is an invention still within that area. And so man goes on suffering,unhappy, lonely, fearful of death and of living, hoping for some great leader tocome and take him out of his misery, a new savior, a new politician. In thisconfusion we are so irresponsible that out of our own disorder we are going tocreate tyrants, hoping they will create order within this area. This is what ishappening outside of us and inside. Any leader we choose will be like us; wewill not choose a leader who is totally different from us. That is the actualpicture of our life: conflict inside and outside, struggle, opposition to oneanother, appalling selfishness.When there is so much sorrow in the world it is necessary to find out foroneself—through careful, slow, patient, hesitating investigation—if there is anyother way of solving all these problems other than through the operation ofthought. Is there an action which is not based on thought? Is there anintelligence which is not the function or the result of thought, which is notput together by thought, which does not come about through cunning, throughfriction and struggle, something entirely different?To communicate one has to listen not just to the speaker but to the very actionof listening. How does one listen? Does one ever really listen at all? Is onefree to listen, or does one always listen with the cunning operations ofthought, with interpretation or prejudice? One has to listen, if one is free, tothe content of one’s consciousness, to listen not only to what is at thesurface, which is fairly simple, but to the deeper layers of it. That means tolisten to the totality of consciousness.How does one listen to and look at one’s consciousness?The speaker was born in a certain country where he absorbed all the prejudices,the irrationalities and the superstitions, the beliefs, the class differences,as a Brahmin. There the young mind absorbed the tradition, the rituals, theextraordinary orthodoxy, and the tremendous discipline imposed by that groupupon itself. And then he moves to the West; and again he absorbs from all thatis there. The content of his consciousness is what has been put into it, what hehas learned, what his thoughts are, and its own emotions, which thoughtrecognizes. That is the content and the consciousness of this person. Withinthat area he has all the political, religious, personal, communal problems. Allthe problems are there. And not being able to solve them himself, he looks tobooks, to others, asking what to do, how to meditate, what to do about personalrelationship with his wife, or his girlfriend, his parents. Should he believe inJesus or in Buddha or the new guru who comes along with a lot of nonsense? He issearching for a new philosophy of life, a new philosophy of politics, and so on,all within this area.Man has done this from time immemorial, but there is no answer within that area.You may meditate for hours, sitting in a certain posture, breathing in a specialway, but it is still within that area because you want something out of yourmeditation.So there is this content of consciousness: dull, stupid, traditional thought,recognizing all its emotions—otherwise they are not emotions. Always it isthought, which is the response of memory, knowledge, and experience operating.Now, can the mind look at it? Can you look at the operation of thought?When you look, who is the observer who is looking at the content? Is itdifferent from the content? This is really a very important question to ask, andto which to find an answer. Is the observer different from the content and,therefore, capable of changing it and going beyond it? Or is the observer thesame as the content? First, look. If the observer—the “I” that looks, the “me”that looks—is different from the observed, then there is a division between theobserver and the observed and, therefore, conflict: “I must not do this; Ishould do that”; “I must get rid of my particular prejudice,” and I adopt a newprejudice; “I must get rid of my old gods,” and I take on new gods. So whenthere is a division between the observer and the observed, there must beconflict. That is a principle, that is a law. So, do I observe the content of myconsciousness as it I were an outsider looking in, altering the pieces andmoving the pieces to different places? Or am I the observer, the thinker, theexperiencer, the same as that which is observed, experienced, thought?If I look at the content of my consciousness as an outsider observing, thenthere must be conflict between what is observed and the observer. There must beconflict, and in that conflict we live: the “me” and the “not me,” “we” and“they.” If “I,” the observer, am different from anger, I try to control it,suppress it, dominate it, overcome it, and there is conflict. But is theobserver different at all? Or is he essentially the same as the observed? If heis the same, then there is no conflict, is there? The understanding of that isintelligence. Then intelligence operates and not conflict.It would be a thousand pities if you did not understand this simple thing. Manhas lived in conflict. He wants peace through conflict. And there can never bepeace through conflict; however many armaments you may have against another’sequally strong armaments, there will never be peace. Only when intelligenceoperates will there be peace, the intelligence that comes when one understandsthat there is no division between the observer and the observed. The insightinto that very fact, that very truth, brings this intelligence.This is a very serious thing, for then you will see that you have nonationality; you may have a passport but you have no nationality. You have nogods. There is no outside authority, nor inward authority. The only authoritythen is intelligence. It is not the cunning intelligence of thought, which ismere knowledge operating within a certain area, and that is not intelligence.So this is the first thing to understand when you look at your consciousness:the division between the thinker and the thought, between the observer and theobserved, between the experiencer and the experienced is false, for they areone. There is no thinker if you do not think. Thought has created the thinker.That is the first thing to understand, to have an insight into the truth of, thefact of, as palpable as you sitting there, so that there is no conflict betweenthe observer and the observed.So, what is the content of your consciousness, the hidden as well as the open?Can you look at it—and not make an effort?You can find this out, not just sitting there, but in your relationships. Thatis the mirror in which you will see, not by closing your eyes, or by going offinto the woods and thinking up some dreams. In the actual fact of yourrelationship with man, woman, your neighbor, your politician, your gods, yourgurus, you will observe your reactions, your attitudes, your prejudices, yourimages, your constant groping. The content is in that. What you are doing now ismerely ploughing, and you can only sow when you observe your relationships andsee what actually is taking place. You can look as much as you like and begin todistinguish various qualities and tendencies, but if you look as an observerdifferent from the observed then you are bound to create conflict and,therefore, further suffering. When you have an insight, see the truth that theobserver is the observed, then conflict ceases altogether. Then a totallydifferent kind of energy comes into operation.There are different kinds of energy. There is physical energy from good food;there may be energy created by emotionalism, sentimentality; there is energycreated by thought through various conflicts and tensions. Within that field ofenergy we have lived, and we are still trying to find greater energy within thatfield to solve our problems. There is a different kind of energy, or thecontinuation of this energy in a totally different form, when the mind isoperating completely, not in the field of thought but intelligently.Can the mind observe its content without any choice as to the content, notchoosing any part of the content, any part of the piece, but observing totally?Now, how is it possible to observe totally? When I look at a map of France, as Icome from England and cross the Channel, I see the road leading to Gstaad. I cantell the mileage, I can see the direction. All that is very simple because it ismarked on the map and I follow it. In doing that, I do not look at any otherpart of the map; I know the direction in which I want to go and that directionexcludes all others. In the same way, a mind that is seeking in a givendirection does not see the whole. If I want to find something that I think isreal, then the direction is set and I follow that direction and my mind isincapable of seeing the totality. Now, when I look at the content of myconsciousness, which is the same as yours, I have set a direction—to go beyondit. A movement in a particular direction, seeking a certain pleasure, notwanting to do this or that, makes one incapable of seeing the whole. If I am ascientist, I see only in a certain direction. If I am an artist, there again. IfI have a certain talent or gift, I see only a certain direction. So the mind isincapable of seeing the totality and the immensity of that totality if there isa movement in a particular direction. So can the mind have no direction at all?This is a difficult question. Please listen to it. Of course, the mind has tohave direction when I go from here to the house, or when I have to drive a car,when I have to perform some technical function; but I am talking of a mind thatunderstands the nature of direction and, therefore, is capable of seeing thewhole. When it sees the whole, it can then also operate in direction. If I havethe whole picture in mind, then I can take in the detail; but if my mind onlyoperates in details, then I cannot take in the whole. If I am concerned with myopinions, with my anxieties, with what I want to do, with what I must do, Icannot see the whole. Obviously. If I come from India with my prejudices,superstitions, and traditions, I cannot see the whole. So can the mind be freeof direction? Which does not mean that it is without direction. When it operatesfrom the whole, the direction becomes clear, very strong and effective; but whenthe mind only operates in a direction according to the pattern it has set foritself, then it cannot see the whole.There is the content of my consciousness. The content makes my consciousness.Now, can the mind look at it as a whole? Can it just look without any direction,without any judgment, without any choice? That implies no observer at all, forthe observer is the past. Can it look with that intelligence which is not puttogether by thought? For thought is the past. Do it. It requires tremendousdiscipline; not the discipline of suppression, control, imitation, orconformity, but a discipline that is an act in which the truth is seen. Theoperation of truth creates its own action, which is discipline.Can your mind look at its content when you talk to another, in your gestures, inthe way you walk, in the way you sit and eat, in the way you behave? Behaviorindicates the content of your consciousness, whether you are behaving accordingto pleasure, reward, or pain, which are part of your consciousness. Thepsychologists say that, so far, man has been educated on the principle ofpunishment and reward, hell and heaven. Now, they say that we must be educatedonly on the principle of reward, that we must not punish but reward—which is thesame thing. To see the absurdity of punishment and reward is to see the whole.When you see the whole, intelligence functions when you act, and you are notthen behaving according to reward or punishment.Behavior exposes the content of your consciousness. You may hide yourself behinda polished behavior, a behavior that is very carefully drilled, but suchbehavior is merely mechanical. From that arises another question: Is the mindentirely mechanical, or is there any portion of the brain that is not mechanicalat all?To go over what has been said: Outside of us, in the political world, in theeconomic world, in the religious world, in the social world, and so on, mankindis searching. There are gods, new gurus, new leaders. And when you observe allthis very clearly you see that man is functioning within the field of thought.Thought, essentially, is never free. Thought is always old because thought isthe response of memory as knowledge and experience. Thought is matter. It is ofthe material world, and thought is trying to escape from that material worldinto a nonmaterial world. But trying to escape into the nonmaterial world bythought is still material. We have all the moral, social, and economic problemsof the individual and the collective. The individual is essentially,intrinsically, part of the collective. The individual is not different from thecollective; he may have different tendencies, different occupations, differentmoods, and so on, but he is intrinsically part of the culture, which is society.Now, those are facts as to what is going on about us. The facts as to what isgoing on inside us are very much the same. We are trying to find an answer tothe major problems of our human life through the operation of thought—thoughtwhich the Greeks imposed upon the West, with their political philosophy, withtheir mathematics, and so on. Thought has not found an answer and it never will.So we must go then into the whole structure of thought and the content that ithas created as consciousness. We must observe the operation of thought inrelationship, in our daily life. That observation implies having an insight asto whether it is a fact that the observer is different from the observed, for ifthere is a difference there must inevitably be conflict, just as there isbetween two ideologies. Ideologies are the inventions of thought, conditioned bythe culture in which they have developed.Now, can you, in your daily life, observe this? In such observation you willfind out what your behavior is, whether it is based on the principle of rewardand punishment—as most of our behavior is, however polished and refined. Fromthat observation one begins to learn what real intelligence is. Not theintelligence that is obtained from a book, or out of experience; that is notintelligence at all. Intelligence has nothing whatsoever to do with thought.Intelligence operates when the mind sees the whole, the endless whole—not mycountry, my problems, my little gods, my meditations. It sees the wholeimplication of living. And this quality of intelligence has its own tremendousenergy.Saanen, July 14, 1974"},{"pageContent":"2 We were saying that the world outside us and inside us is in a chaotic conditionand that the politicians, the leaders, the priests, are all trying to solve ourproblems in the field of thought. This has been so for centuries upon centuries.But one sees that suffering still goes on: there are endless wars, governmentsare more or less corrupt, politicians play a crooked game, and ideologies andsystems have taken the place of morality and intelligence. Seeing all this,objectively, without any prejudice, without being dedicated to any particularideology or any system, one observes that thought is divisive and thatexcellence in thought is not necessarily excellence in conduct.We are concerned with something that one has to go through, investigate deeply,as deeply as one can, verbally and nonverbally. That demands a great deal ofcare, affection and consideration, a sense of intimate communication with eachother. It demands that you and I share the thing together. You share it not byjust listening to a series of words or ideas or concepts—because they are notideas or concepts with which to agree or disagree—but rather, by really takingpart in it with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your energy. Suchserious concern and commitment do reveal a great deal, not only the source ofour thought and its mischief, but also the source of action.We live by action; we cannot possibly avoid action. You may withdraw from theworld into a monastery, take vows, but that is still action. You may specializein a particular field which gives you an opportunity for your talent and acareer—that is action. Action is also in relationship between you and another.The movement of life is action.Thought, in civilizations so far, has produced actions which are conflicting,contradictory, opposing; therefore, breeding great mischief and misery. Isexcellence in thought and, therefore, action, possible? Or is there alwaysconflict when thought produces action? This is your life, and if you wouldunderstand your life, your behavior, your conduct, your relationship, yourconfusion, to find out what to do so that action is excellent at all levels,then you must ask if there is an action that is not fragmented by thought.Thought is fragmentary in its very nature and yet through thought you are tryingto find at all levels an action which will not be contradictory, which will notbe regretful, which will be whole, total, complete. Is there an action that issupremely excellent yet is not based on the movement of thought?Why is thought—upon which we live, upon which our whole social morality isdependent—divisive? Thought is matter. It is the response of the past. Itcreates the movement of time as yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Thought has itssource and root in the past and, having its root in the past, it must createtime as movement. One sees that by its very nature, by its very function andstructure, thought has its being essentially in the past. It lives in tradition,in the accumulated knowledge that society has acquired, and in the greataccumulation of scientific knowledge, all of which is in the past. Thought isessentially a movement from the past. Therefore, it must be divisive. It canpretend, or speculate, or conceive, that it is beyond time; it can imagine atimeless state, but it is still thought. It can pretend that it is going beyondits own limits, but it is still thought. So thought creates a boundary of timearound itself, and that is the factor of division.We are all reared in the field of thought. Education is a movement in thought,the getting of more and more knowledge, the refinement of thought. Thought,being divisive, whatever action it creates must be fragmented, which thereforegives rise to conflict. This is a principle. Man has lived, historically as weknow it, in a series of crises and responses, which inevitably breed moreconflict. One sees it in the modern world. There is a crisis: thought tries toanswer it and, in the very answering of it, more problems are created. Onecountry supplies arms to another knowing well that that is going to create moretrouble, and so on, and so on.So can thought ever bring about an action that is total, whole, sane, notcontradictory? Our life is contradictory: we live at different levels—at thebusiness level, the family level, the scientific level, the religious level, orat the artistic level—each opposing the other, each specializing in his owndepartment. Specialization becomes exclusive and, therefore, contradictory and,therefore, destructive. Thought, trying to be excellent in its action,specializes and brings about more conflict, more division. Each specializationhas its own ambitious end; each career has its own reward, which iscontradictory, opposed to affection, care, consideration, and love. Looking atit, one asks if there is an action that is whole, not fragmentary, an action inwhich there is no regret, no sense of fulfillment, no sense of frustration.Is there such an action? That is what we are asking all our life, for whateverwe do brings a certain pain, a certain confusion, or a certain reward in thepursuit of which we create more division. It is inevitable and natural andlogical to ask if there is an action that is not born out of the movement ofthought.I will go into something which may appear to be different, but which is not. Weneed energy. We have physical energy, emotional energy, the energy of hate, theenergy of lust, the energy of great passion, and the energy of great tensionthat is brought about through the sense of frustration, division, and lack offulfillment. As one gets older, the body becomes rather worn out, disease andpain come, and energy wastes away. Most of our energy is the product ofconflict—I am this, I should be that—or of fright and the aggressive desire tocontinue in a given direction. There is the energy that is brought about throughcommitment to an ideal—the whole communist world is based on that, from Leninuntil now, destroying people by the millions to get what it thinks is right.That gives one tremendous energy. The saint, dedicated to an ideal, to apicture, to an imagination, to a formula, has an extraordinary energy. Theidealists have an extraordinary energy. In any form of specialization, energy isrequired. The more you specialize, the more energy you have. This is what onesees not only in oneself but also outside.Thought creates its own energy. To produce such a marvelous machine as asubmarine, one must have tremendous energy and cooperation, energy that isbrought about through an idea, through organized thought. And this kind ofenergy is always—in the deep sense of that word—destructive, because it isdivisive.Now, is there an energy that is not destructive, that is not divisive, that isnot mechanical, not based on idea or a commitment to an ideology? Is there anenergy that is not in any way involved in the field of time as thought,movement?Life is action. In the very living, all relationship is action, movement inaction. And that movement, that action, is based on thought. At present, allpolitical, religious, social, and economic life, and moral relativism, are basedon thought, which is divisive, contradictory, and breeding misery. Is there anaction totally unrelated to all that? To find out, one must have energy. It isnot mere intellectual energy, with all its accumulated knowledge, nor emotionalenergy, which is recognizable by thought and, therefore, still part of thought,but an energy that can bring about a total transformation in the very process ofthe mind. To inquire very deeply into whether there is an action that is notbased on the movement of thought, you need a great deal of energy, not theenergy of trying to find an end, not the energy that you have when you aremoving in a particular direction, but the energy that can change the content ofconsciousness.To put it differently, one knows what the content of one’s consciousness is—ifone is at all awake and aware, attending to one’s behavior, watching, listening.The desire to change that content is a movement in a particular direction. Thatdoes give energy but it is divisive. Yet one realizes that the content must betotally changed because we cannot go on as we are unless we want to destroy thewhole of humanity. The content makes consciousness. Therefore, when there istotal transformation of the content there is a different kind of—I won’t call itconsciousness—a different level altogether. To bring about that change, oneneeds tremendous energy.So there must be freedom from direction. Please see the logic of it, the sanityof it. There must be freedom from a conclusion. Although a conclusion may giveone a great deal of energy, it is a kind of energy that is wasteful. The mindmust be free of the response of thought. It must be free of ideals because theyagain have direction. The mind must be free of all the divisive movements ofthought, as nationality, as race, as religion.Now, can your mind be free of all that? If it cannot, then do what youwill—stand on your head for ten thousand years, or meditate sitting in a posturebreathing rightly for another ten thousand years—you will never find the other.So, can the mind see how stupid, how unintelligent, ideals are? Can it see thetruth of it, not just say that they are wrong and put them away? For when yousee the truth of it, you are free of it—not as when you logically orhistorically examine something, but as when you see something poisonous and youdrop it. There is no conflict because intelligence sees that it is stupid to gothe way of ideals. Can you free your mind from all this?Do you free it one thing at a time, or do you free it totally? If you free itone thing at a time, that takes energy—looking at how stupid nationality is anddropping it; looking at ideals and seeing that they do not lead anywhere, thatthey breed conflict, and dropping them. Will you free the mind layer by layer,which will take time, which will take analysis? Traditionally it is said thatyou must go step by step, that first you must get rid of this, control yourbody, breathe rightly. Not only traditional but modern psychology says to gostep by step, analyze, tear away layer by layer. You can spend years until youdie doing that. Will you go through that process taking long years? Now, is thatnot a wastage of energy? If it is, then how shall the mind empty itself of itscontent so that it has a totally different kind of energy, a totally differentexistence? Is there a way of looking at all this totally and, therefore, beingtotally free of it?The content of my mind is the content of your mind. The content of yourconsciousness is the content of my consciousness, slightly modified, with alittle more or a little less color, a little more or a little less elaboration,more artistry and less something else, but more or less the same. The mindbecomes aware of this and it says, “How can I be aware of the totality of it,not only of the conscious but the unconscious?” I know I can strip layer afterlayer, both of the conscious as well as of the unconscious; I know I can gothrough that process, taking time, analyzing, knowing the danger of analysis. Ican do that. That is the traditional, accepted way to do this. And I see thatthat takes infinite time, because every step in analysis must be accurate,otherwise the next step will be corrupted by the previous analysis. So, eachanalysis must be complete, true, and final, otherwise I am lost. And who is theanalyzer? Is not the analyzer the analyzed? So I see that that is not going todo a thing.So what am I to do? What is my mind to do when it has seen the absurdity ofthis?Now, has it actually seen the absurdity of it, or does it imagine it has seen itbecause somebody has said that it is absurd? We are secondhand people, so am Iaccepting the authority of another when I say it is absurd? That is a verbalassertion without any reality. That acceptance has no validity; it does notproduce results. So the mind discards authority, whether it is traditional orthe authority I have cultivated out of my own desires and selfishness, myauthority which asserts that I know. The mind totally discards authority. Notthe authority of law, obviously, but the psychological authority of someone whotells you what to do because you are in confusion and look to somebody who willfree you from that confusion, out of your disorder creating the authority. It ishistorically so. Wherever there is disorder, a man springs up and tyrannicallybrings about some kind of order, which is total disorder. So, can the mind putaway authority because it sees the truth about it, the significance of it, thenature of it? Not just as a reaction against authority, as we do, because whenyou react against authority you are creating another authority. That is obvious.Can the mind, your mind, be free of the traditional approach of analysis,introspectively trying to improve? Because you see the truth of being free ofauthority; therefore, there is no guru, no savior, there are no steps throughmeditation to come upon something extraordinary. There is somethingextraordinary, but not through this way. Can the mind put away all this, denyall this, without any resistance? To do that you must look. You must lookoutwardly and inwardly; hear the music of the world and the discord of the worldand the music inwardly and the discord outwardly, because both are the same. Weare an intrinsic part of the world. To do this we require energy and this energyis not brought about by concepts, by words. This energy comes when you haveinsight into the disorder of a mind that functions mechanically in the movementof thought. So, no belief, no idea, no concept, no ideal, no commitment of anykind in that field. Then, through negation of what is false—not throughresistance or reaction to the false—through choiceless rejection of what isfalse, you have a different kind of energy.It is simple enough. If you climb a mountain you must discard all the thingsthat you have been carrying on the plain, you must put them all aside. It is farmore important to understand attachment and the corrupting factors ofthought—which are attachment and power, domination in different forms, thecorruption of property and possessions—than to search, or to take vows.Most of us are attached to possessions, whether it is an antique table, whichyou look after and polish very carefully, or a house, or a person, a group, anidea, or a particular form of experience. Why is the mind attached—to our looks,our hair, our worries? There are so many things we are attached to. Why? Andthen, knowing that possessions in any form are one of the major corruptingfactors in life we say, “Do not possess, have a few clothes that are necessary,but do not possess, take a vow of nonpossession.” In that there is a lot oftravail: “I want that; I must give it up, I have taken a vow.” Possessionscorrupt, and we say we must be detached from possessions, so then there is allthe conflict involved in that. Understanding attachment is much more importantthan detachment.Why is there attachment? Not how to be detached, but why is the mind attached?Why are you attached to your house, to your wife, to your girl, to your ideas,to your meditations, to your systems? Why? What would happen if you were notattached?Attachment gives a certain occupation to the mind; you constantly think aboutsomething. The brain and the mind say, “I must be occupied with something”—withmy god, with my sex, with my drink; “I must be occupied”—with the kitchen, orwith some social order, or commune, or whatever it is. Out of this demand foroccupation there is attachment, holding on to something. Why must the mind be sooccupied? What would happen if it were not so occupied? Would it go astray?Would it disintegrate? Would it feel utterly naked, empty? Does the fear of thatemptiness demand occupation and, therefore, give importance to the furniture,the book, the idea, and so on? It is out of the empty feeling and loneliness,from not being totally whole, that the mind is attached. Can the mind live, bevital, energetic, full of depth, without attachment? Of course it can.Is love attachment? Not that love is detachment. When love is attached ordetached then it is painful, which we all know; we go through that ugly state.Power is another form of corruption—political power, religious power, power inthe business world, power in the exercise of a certain talent that one has. Whenyou dominate somebody, your cook or your servant, your wife or your husband,there is tremendous pleasure. That is another factor of corruption. That energy,which is so necessary to bring about a transformation in the content ofconsciousness, is dissipated in all these ways. Can you see all this as fact, asa dangerous fact? Not a relative danger, but a total danger for human beings.Now, if you see that as real danger, as you would see the danger of a fallingrock, you move away from it instantly and you are free of it. To observe this,you need a certain sensitivity, physical as well as psychological, and youcannot have this sensitivity if you are indulging in all kinds of things—drink,sex, overworking. So, if you are at all serious, if you give your attention,your care, your affection to this, then you will see for yourself that out ofthis freedom from the division that thought has created, there is another kindof energy, which is intelligence. That intelligence is not put together bythought. It is not the cunning intelligence of a politician or a priest or abusinessman. It comes out of the freedom that is perceiving the falseness, theunreality of all that. Can your mind see it totally? It cannot see it totally ifit has any direction at all.An intelligent mind acts in the field of thought intelligently, sanely, withoutresistance. It is free from the structure and implications of attachment, fromthe action of attachment, from the pursuit of power with all its complications,the ruthlessness of it. It sees the dividing process of thought, and seeing thatclearly, totally, it has energy. That energy is intelligence. Having thatenergy, that intelligence, it can operate in the field of thought, not the otherway round.One can see that there is no division between the outside and the inside, it isan interrelationship. One sees that, and one also sees that one needs energy totransform the mind. So one discards everything that is wasteful, everything thatis psychological, everything that breeds division and conflict within the mind.It can be done only when there is an observation of it, not a resistance to it.There is such observation only when the observer is the observed. The observeris the past, put together by thought in terms of experience, knowledge, memory,tradition; they are the essence of the observer. What it observes, which is theresult of thought, is still thought. The chaos in the world, the misery, thestarvation, the poverty, the brutality, the violence, the mess that is going on,the madness that is going on, is created by thought. And it is the observer whosays, “I must change all that”—if he is at all intelligent, if he is at allawake and not concerned with his own little pattern of life. But is the observerdifferent from what he observes? He is put together by thought also, so he isthe observed. Now when the understanding of that takes place, not as a verbalstatement but as a reality, conflict ceases and the mind goes beyond thelimitations that thought has imposed on action.Now can you do this? If you cannot, why not? Is it because you are indolent,lazy, indifferent, not only to your own sorrow, to your own suffering, to yourown misery, but to the misery of millions of people, to what is going on inRussia, in India, and elsewhere? Are you totally indifferent to all that,because you want to find God, you want to meditate, you want to learn how tobreathe properly, how to have the right kind of sexual relationship, and so on?If you are concerned with the whole of humanity, not just your neighbor or yourwife but with the whole of humanity, then when you see that whole you can putthe detail in order. But without the perception of the whole you cannot put thedetail in order. The politicians, the analysts, the priests, fail to see this.It is only you and I, if we are utterly responsible, concerned, serious,committed, who will be able to meet these problems because we have seen thewhole and, therefore, are extraordinarily alive and intelligent and yet able tofunction in detail.Saanen, July 16, 1974"},{"pageContent":"3 We have talked of understanding our actions, of our behavior and the content ofconsciousness. Unless we understand the nature and the structure of thisconsciousness in which we act, through which all our behavior and all ourthinking takes place, it seems to me we shall always be floundering, confused,always living in constant battle within ourselves and outside. We shall never beable to find peace, a sense of deep inward tranquility. In a world that isgetting madder and madder every day, where there is so much brutality, violence,deception, and chicanery, it is so necessary that all of us should understandthis immense problem of living.We are going to concern ourselves now with what is called materialism.Materialism means evaluating life as matter, matter in its movement andmodification, also matter as consciousness and will. We have to go into it tofind out if there is anything more than matter and if we can go beyond it. Thisis not merely an intellectual amusement and investigation but rather a deepinquiry as to whether our minds and our whole social, economic, and religiouslife is entirely material. Is all existence, including consciousness and will,the movement and modification of matter?We are ruled by our senses—taste, smell, touch, and so on; they play a greatpart in our life. The brain, if you examine it, if you are rather aware of itsactivities, holds in its cells memory as experience and knowledge. What thesecells hold is material; so thought, the capacity to think, is matter. And youcan imagine, or construct through thought, as thought, “otherness”; that is tosay, other than matter—but it is still matter as imagination. We know that welive in a material world, based on our sensations, desires, and emotions, and weconstruct a content of consciousness that is essentially the product of thought.We know that, if we do not just romanticize but go into it very deeply andseriously; yet, knowing that, we say there must be “otherness,” something beyondthat. So thought begins to investigate “the other.” But when thoughtinvestigates “the other,” it is still material. It is important to understandthis because we are all so romantically minded; all our religions aresentimental and romantic. Living in this very small field of materialism, wewant to have something much greater beyond. That is a natural desire. So thoughtconstructs a verbal or nonverbal structure of God, otherness, immensity,timelessness, and so on. But it is still the product of thought, so it is stillmaterial.So thought creates the form outside, thinking that that form, that image, thatprototype, is not material. But that form is the product of thought; the idealis still the product of thought, so it is still material. If you go to India orelsewhere in the East, they will tell you they accept that, but they say thereis a higher self, there is a superconsciousness, which dominates the material,or encloses the material—as in the West you have the soul. They call it by aSanskrit word, Atman. But the Atman. the superconsciousness, the soul, is stillthe product of thought. Thought is matter; whatever its movements, inside,outside, in trying to go beyond itself, it is still material.So the question arises: Is the mind mechanical? That is, in your mind, are yourthoughts, your feelings, your reactions, your responsibilities, yourrelationships, your ways, your opinions, and so on, merely mechanical; that is,responding according to conditioning, according to environmental influence? Ifthat is the totality of the mind, then we live in a tremendous, inescapableprison.This has been the problem of man right through the ages. He knows he lives bythe senses, by his desires, by touch, by appetites—sexual, intellectual, andotherwise—and he questions: “Is that all?” Then he begins to invent the gods,the supergods, superconsciousness, and so on and so on. Having invented andprojected a form, he pursues it, thinking he is tremendously idealistic ortremendously religious. But his pursuit of what he calls “God” or truth is stillthe pursuit of the product of thought, which is material. See what he has beendoing. See what his churches, temples, and the mosques have done to him, to eachone of us. Sense this great deception on which he has been fed, which he thinksis extraordinarily idealistic. When one realizes that, in seriousness, it israther a shock, because one is stripped of all illusion.If one has gone that far, one then begins to ask if there is a movement otherthan the movement of thought. How does one find out? If one is trying to findout if there is something beyond the material, then one must examine what is thecause of one’s search. Is the cause of one’s search an escape from this? Causemeans motive. Is all one’s inquiry motivated? Because if it is, the root of thatis either the seeking of pleasure or the escape from fear. Or, if it is fromtotal dissatisfaction with what is. then it projects its own answer. Therefore,to inquire into “the other,” my mind must be without cause.We said, and we are saying again, that there must be a transformation in themind, not peripheral reformation but a revolution deep in the mind, to solve theproblems that thought has created, whether they are religious, economic, social,or moral. If one is really serious, not flippant, not merely amused byintellectual theories or philosophies that are invented by thought, then onemust be concerned and totally committed to this question of transforming thecontent of consciousness. For it is the content that makes up consciousness, aswe said. And we asked who the entity is that is to change it. We said that theobserver is the observed and that when there is a division between the observerand the observed, the “me” and the “not me,” then there is conflict. Thatconflict is essentially a waste of energy. And when you look into it and findthat the observer is the observed, you remove conflict altogether and you haveenormous energy because it is no longer wasted in conflict.Now this energy is either in the field of thought or it is an energy totallydifferent from thought. For a mind that is burdened, conditioned, and shaped bymaterialistic thought, is there a movement other than that of thought? To findthat out, we must look into the cause of this search. Where there is a causethere is time. The cause produces an effect and that effect again becomes acause. It is not really difficult because this is our life; it becomes difficultwhen you treat it, or look at it, as something apart from our daily life.Put it differently. What is virtue, morality? Is morality transient? Is moralityrelative? Or is it absolute? For us, in the modern world, morality is relative,and that relativism is nearly destroying us. So one asks: What is virtue? Isthere an absolute virtue, a sense of no hate under any circumstances? Is there acomplete peace, an absolute peace, which can never be disturbed? Can one livewithout any sense of violence? Or is violence relative, hate modified, and soon? So what is virtue? If you hit me and I hit you back and apologize for itlater, that becomes relative. If I have a cause for hating you, or dislikingyou, or being violent, that cause makes my action not complete and, therefore,relative. Is there a way of living which has no cause? Because the moment youhave a cause, living becomes relative. If I have cause to love you—because yougive me comfort, psychologically, physically, sexually, morally—it is not love.So where there is a cause, action must be relative. But when there is no cause,action will be absolute.See what takes place in your life, not in the explanation I am giving. If Idepend on you, if I am attached to you, that dependence and attachment have acause. It is because I am lonely, or I am unhappy, or I want companionship; Iwant your love, your affection, your care, and so I am attached to you. Fromthat attachment there is great sorrow, there is pain. Because you do not loveme, or you only tolerate me, or give me a little of your affection and turn tosomebody else, there is jealousy, antagonism, hate, and all the rest thatfollows. Where there is a cause, then action, morality, must be relative.Can the mind be free of form, free of the ideal, of form as a cause, so that themind is capable of going beyond itself? It is very simple really; words make itso difficult. Words are necessary in order to communicate, but if you merelylive at the verbal level they are absolutely useless. It is like ploughing,ploughing, ploughing—and you destroy the earth by merely ploughing.We have this problem, which man right from the beginning has sought to solve,which is: Is all life mechanical? Is all life material? Is all existence,including mind and consciousness and will, matter? Is your whole life that? Youmay pretend it is not, but actually it is that. Being enclosed in that, thoughtcreates a form, the ideal of the supreme, the highest form of excellence, greatnobility, the gods, as well as all the other things that thought has puttogether in the world, the immense technological movement. It is all matter. Andliving on this shore as we are, with our wars, our hatreds, our appallingpolitics—living on this side of the river, which is matter, the mind says, “Iwant to go across; there must be something there because this life is toostupid.” And it is stupid: just to go to the office, to earn money, to takeresponsibility, to struggle, compete, worry, to despair, to have anxieties,immense sorrows, and then die. We say that is not good enough. We may put itmore philosophically, in more extravagant or romantic language, but we see it isstupid and we want something more.Then we say: “How are we to cross this river to the other shore?” We ask, “Whowill take us across?” When we ask that question, there is the priest, the guru,the man who knows, and he says, “Follow me”—and then we are done, because he isexactly like us, because he still functions within the field of thought. He hascreated the gods, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna. He has created the form and that formis as materialistic as your sensations; it is the product of thought. Now, ifthat is absolutely clear and there is no romantic escape, no ideological washingof the hands, no seeking comfort and all the other things that lead toillusions, if it is absolutely clear that any modification within the field ofconsciousness is merely moving from one object to another within the field ofthought, then what is the mind to do? Or not to do?First, such a mind must be in total order, material order, because if it is indisorder it cannot go away from itself. Thought is matter and all its activitywithin consciousness has created extraordinary confusion and disorder.Politically, religiously, socially, morally, in relationships, in everydirection it has created disorder. And that is your life. Unless there isabsolute order—and I am using the word absolute not relative—unless there isabsolute order within that area, any cause to move away from that area is stillthe product of disorder. So there must be order.Now, how does this order come about politically, religiously, intellectually,morally, physically, in relationships—an absolute order, not a convenient order,not a relative order? How is the mind, which has been trained, educated,conditioned, to live in disorder and to accept disorder, to bring order initself? Bear in mind, that if you say there is an outside agency which willbring order, then that outside agency is the product of thought and, therefore,it will create contradiction—and, therefore, disorder. If you say the action ofwill will bring about order, then what is will? “I will do that”—look at it,find out. When you are aggressive, when you say, “I must do that,” what is thatwill that is in action? Is it not desire, a projected end to be achieved, theachieving of an end projected by thought as an ideal, as a form, as an originalpattern? Can thought bring order? That is the way the politicians and thepriests and all the so-called reformers are trying to achieve it. Thought hascreated disorder. So what is one to do?Can the mind, your mind, observe, see, this disorder? One is in disorder. Onesees that the exercise of will, the following of another, having desire toovercome disorder, is still within the field of disorder. So one says tooneself, “What am I to do; what is the mind to do?” First of all, does one knowdisorder? Does the mind see disorder, or does it know only the description ofdisorder? You describe to me a mountain, its beauty, its snow, its lines againstthe blue sky, the depth of shadows in the forest, the running waters, the murmurof trees, the beauty of it all. You describe it to me and the descriptioncatches my mind and I live with that description. But the description is notthat which is described. So one asks oneself, “Am I caught in the description,or am I actually seeing disorder?” One is intellectual, the other is factual.Now, is the mind observing its disorder, which means no word, not being caughtin the description, but merely observing this enormous disorder? Can the mind soobserve? And in observing its own disorder, is there an “observer” looking atit, or is there no observer at all, but merely the observing?I observe you, I see you. I met you last year; you were pleasant or unpleasantto me; you flattered or insulted me, or neglected me. The memory of thatremains. This year I meet you and the memory responds. That memory is the pastand also that memory is the observer. Of course. Can the mind observe all thedisorder, social and moral and so on, which is created by thought, in which Iam, which is part of me? Can it observe this disorder without the observer? Ifthe observer is there looking at disorder, then there is a division between theobserver and the observed. In that division, conflict takes place: “I mustcontrol it, I must change it, I must suppress it, I must overcome it,” and soon. Now when the observer is not, and there is only observation, then there isno conflict, there is merely observing. Then there is energy to go beyonddisorder.Where there is division, there must be disorder. The observer, rooted in thepast, is essentially the factor of division. Now can the mind see the truth ofthat and observe the actual disorder of your life, not the description? Can itobserve your disorder, your confusion, your anxieties, your contradictions, yourselfish demands, all that? Observe. And if it observes without the observerthere is then the going beyond it, which means total order, not relative orderbut mathematical order that is essential before you can go any further. Withoutorder in the material world, in the world of matter, in the world of thought,the mind has no basis, no foundation on which to move.Therefore, there must be observation of behavior. Do I behave according to amotive, according to circumstances? Is my behavior pragmatic, or is it under allcircumstances the same? Not the same in the sense of copying a pattern; is it abehavior that is never relative, that is not based on reward and punishment?Inquire into it, observe it and you will find how terrible your behavior is, howyou look to a superior and inferior and all the other things you do. There isnever a constant movement free of the motive of reward and punishment.Then also you have to inquire into relationship in the material world.Relationship is of the highest importance, because life is relationship. What isyour relationship? Have you any relationship? Relationship means to respondadequately to any challenge. As I inquire into relationship, is my relationshipwith another personal and intimate, or not so intimate? Is it based on myopinions, my memories, my hurts, my demands, my sexual appetites? If myrelationship to you is relative, it changes: I am moody one day, not moody thenext day, the next day I am affectionate, and the third day I hate you, and thefourth day I love you, and so on, and so on. If that relationship is notsatisfactory, I will go to somebody else. This is the game that we have beenplaying for centuries. Now it is more open, more extravagant, more vulgar, thatis all.So my mind has to find out what its relationships actually are. Unless there iscomplete harmony in the material world in which I live, which is part of me, inme, which is my consciousness, the mind cannot possibly go beyond itself. Thatis why your meditations, your postures, your breathing exercises, your going toIndia and searching, are so utterly meaningless.So, is my relationship relative? Is all relationship relative? Or is there norelationship at all except when the division as the “me” and the “you” does notexist? I am related to you because I love you, because you give me food,clothes, shelter, you give me sex, you give me companionship. I have built amarvelous image about you; we may get annoyed with each other, irritated, butthat is trivial. And I hold on to you; I am attached to you, and in thatattachment there is great pain, there is great sorrow, suffering, torture,jealousy, antagonism. And then I say to myself, “I must be free of that.” And infreeing myself from that I attach myself to somebody else. And the game beginsagain. So I say to myself, “What is this relationship? Is there a relationship?Can there ever be a relationship?” There is the “me” that is pursuing myappetites, my ambitions, my greed, my fears, my wanting to have more prestige,greater position, and so on; and there is the other also pursuing his or her owndemands. Is there any relationship possible at all between two human beings,each functioning with and pursuing his own exclusive, selfish, demands?There may be no relationship in that direction, but there may be relationshipwhen there is no “me” at all. When the “me,” as thought, is nonexistent, I amrelated; then I am related to you, the trees, the mountains, to the rivers, tohuman beings. That means love—does it not?—which has no cause.Consciousness, with its content, is within the field of matter. The mind cannotpossibly go beyond that unless it has complete order within itself and conflictin relationship has come totally to an end—which means a relationship in whichthere is no “me.”This is not just a verbal explanation: the speaker is telling you what he lives,not what he talks about; if he does not live it, it is hypocrisy, a dirty thingto do.When the mind has order and the sense of total relationship, then what takesplace? Then the mind is not seeking at all, it is not capable of any kind ofillusion. That is absolutely necessary, because thought can invent anyexperience, any kind of vision, any kind of superconsciousness and all the restof it. There is no ideal, there is no form, there is only behavior, which isorder and the sense of relationship for the whole of man. There you have thefoundation.Now another question arises from this: Is the brain totally conditioned? Thisbrain of mankind has had thousands and thousands of experiences; it is educatedwith a great deal of accumulated knowledge from books and elsewhere, and that isthere in the brain. And thought operates only within that field of the known. Itcan invent a field that says, “Apart from knowing, I am there,” but that is toosilly. So my mind is asking: Is the whole brain conditioned by the economic,social, environmental, religious, culture it has lived in? Is the mind, in whichis included the brain, totally conditioned within the borders of time? Is themind a complete slave?Do not say yes or no, for then you have settled it, then there is nothing moreinto which to inquire. But a mind that is asking, groping, looking, without anymotive, without any direction, says, “Is the mind totally conditioned and,therefore, mechanical?” And you see that it is mechanical when it is functioningin the field of knowledge, whether scientific, technological, or the priestlytradition. It is mechanical; there is repetition, repetition, repetition. Thatis what is going on—the repetition of desire, sexual or otherwise, repeating,repeating, repeating. Therefore, the mind asks itself, “Is the totality of thisthing mechanical, or is there, in this field of the mind, an area that is notmechanical?” Can the mind be free of causation, for where there is causation,all movement as thought must be mechanical.Saanen, July 18, 1974"},{"pageContent":"4 Our chief concern is the transformation, the radical change, of the human mind.The human mind includes the brain, the heart, the organism as a whole, the mindthat has created this world around us, the world of corruption, violence,brutality, vanity, and all the structures that bring about war. We are concernedwith the change of the content of consciousness because the content makesconsciousness. Unless that radical revolution, that psychological change, comesabout, there will be no end to conflict, no end to suffering and all theviolence that is going on throughout the world.This change cannot possibly be brought about without knowing oneself,self-knowledge. This is not knowledge of the “higher self or knowledge of some“supreme consciousness,” for they are still within the field of thought. Unlessone understands one’s self, the self of every day—what it thinks, what it does,its devotions, its deceptions, its ambitions, all its self-centered activities,its identification with something noble or ignoble, the state or some ideal—oneis still within the field of the “me.” Unless one understands that narrowingfield, of which one is so little aware—the field in which there is theunconscious as well as the conscious, which is concerned with the individualego, its individual ambitions and reactions, which are essentially a part of thewhole, part of the community, part of the culture in which it lives—unless weunderstand that radically, the content of consciousness cannot possibly betransformed.“Understanding” is not an intellectual, an emotional, or a passing, thing. It issomething that comes with action and, therefore, it is a complete understandingand not a partial understanding. In understanding oneself, one’s consciousnessand its content—for there is no consciousness without content—one sees there aretwo principal factors, pleasure and fear. They cannot be separated. Where thereis the pursuit, the insistence on, and the demand for pleasure, there must be inits wake fear. In understanding fear, one must not disregard the fact ofpleasure.Thought is the measure of fear. Thought is the response of memory, which isexperience and knowledge stored up in the brain cells and tissues. Thought ismatter. The whole world is constructed from thought, is based in its very natureand substance and activity on thought. One has to find out whether it is thoughtthat has bred fear. Not how to be free of fear; freedom from fear willinevitably come about when one understands the structure, the nature, and thefunctioning of thought.When one observes the whole process of thought—which has created the world withall its religions, with all its gods, with its saviors, which has created thematerialistic world in which we live—one sees that, as long as we function thereand remain there, fear must continue. Fear is the cause of loneliness, ofdeprivation, both physical and psychological; it is the cause of attachment toproperty, to people, ideas, concepts, nationalities, families. As long as thereis this functioning of thought within the material world—and it has to functionin that world—fear must remain. What else has one if one lives in that world,for there one must seek security, physical or psychological! As long as the mindseeks material security, as long as the mind asserts a permanency, there must befear. Yet the brain can only function effectively, objectively, rationally, ifit has complete security. That is obvious. When it has no security, it seekssecurity in belief in gods, in symbols, in ideologies, in nationalities, whichleads to neurotic action. As long as I call myself a nationalist of a particularcountry, I am behaving neurotically; I bring about conflict and division betweenpeople. That is one of the causes of fear. When you realize that, when you areaware of its whole nature, are you still a nationalist? If you are, there mustbe the continuance of pleasure and of fear.If the mind lives totally in the material world, then nothing exists but matter,which is thought, consciousness and will. If the mind lives there, fear will goon, because there, there is nothing else but the demand for material securityand permanency. Where there is that demand, there must be fear.There are all the various fears concealed in the very recesses of one’sconsciousness: racial, collective, the fear of famine, and so on. There arehidden fears and extraordinarily subtle forms of pleasure. There is fear, bothconscious and unconscious, the fear of death, of loneliness, of losing a job,the fear of what people will say, the fear of your own attachments and of losingthem, the fear of not succeeding, not becoming great. Can they all beexposed—and without analysis? We have seen the futility of analysis, how theanalyzer and the analyzed are the same. So, what is a mind to do when itrealizes the absurdity, the falseness, of analysis or introspective examination?To understand what the mind is to do, we must go into the question ofmeditation. When we use the word meditation, hear it as though you have neverheard the word before. What is meditation? Not how to meditate; that isirrelevant, because the moment you understand what meditation is, it happensnaturally, like breathing. To find out what meditation is, the real meaning, canyou learn from another? Volumes have been written about it. People havemeditated according to a particular system—Zen or the many, many varieties andmethods of the Hindu systems. They all imply an end to be achieved throughcontrol. Control implies a controller. And is the controller different from thecontrolled? The meditative groups, with their systems and their philosophies,say, “Control your thought!” Thought wanders about and that wandering about is awastage of energy; therefore, they say thought must be absolutely held,disciplined, subjugated in the pursuit of that thing called enlightenment, God,truth, what you will, the nameless. That implies a controller, obviously. Andwho is the controller? Is he different in quality, in nature, from that which hesays he is going to control? This is very important to understand.The speaker wants to point out that one can live completely in daily life,without any control, against all the traditions, against all your education,your social and moral behaviors. To live a life absolutely without any controlsmeans you have to understand very, very deeply who is the controller and what isthe controlled, for this is part of meditation. Is the controller different fromthat which he is controlling, which is thought? Some say the controller isdifferent, that he is the higher self, that he is part of the higherconsciousness, that he is the essence of understanding or the essence of thepast, which has accumulated so much knowledge. But the controller is stillwithin the field of thought; and however much that thought may be elevated, itis still within the area of time and measure.Do you see the truth of this? Not the verbal acceptance of it, or theintellectual comprehension of it, but the truth that all the gods, Christian orHindu, all of them, are the invention of thought. Thought can project itselfinto all kinds of states, into all kinds of illusions, and when thought saysthere is the higher self, it is still within the field of thought and,therefore, that higher self is still matter.When you see that the controller is the controlled, the whole aspect ofmeditation changes. Meditation means the emptying of consciousness of itscontent. Then only can the mind and the brain be absolutely quiet. Thatabsolute—not relative—that absolute quietness is necessary to observe. Not toexperience! Experiences we have had, of every kind, and thought desires moreexperience, including the experience of another state, another dimension. We arefed up with this world and its experiences; they are boring, they are limited,confined, narrow, and we want an experience which is totally different. Now, toexperience involves recognition. If I do not recognize, is there an experience?I have had the experience of looking at a mountain, the beauty of it, theshadow, the lovely deep blue of an early morning, the whole sense of somethingextraordinary and magnificent. That experience cannot exist if there is norelationship to the past. And so experience implies recognition from the past.And the mind wants to experience something supreme. But to recognize it. it mustalready have had it. Therefore, it is not the supreme, it is still theprojection of thought.Meditation is that in which there is no experience. In that there is no elementof time, which implies movement and direction. Direction implies will. Can themind empty itself of time, direction, and movement, which implies the ending ofthought? That is the whole problem.We need knowledge to function; to speak any language, we need knowledge; todrive a car, we need knowledge; to do anything, we need knowledge. What placehas knowledge in meditation? Or has it no place at all? It has no place becauseknowledge is merely a continuation of the past, it is still the movement oftime. So can the mind empty itself of the past and come upon that area of itselfthat is not touched by thought? We have only operated, so far, within the areaof thought as knowledge. Is there any other part, any other area of the mind,which includes the brain, which is not touched by human struggle, pain, anxiety,fear and all the violence, all the things that man has made through thought? Thediscovery of that area is meditation.That implies the discovery of whether thought can come to an end yet stilloperate when necessary in the field of knowledge. We need knowledge, otherwisewe cannot function, we would not be able to speak, nor be able to write, and soon. Knowledge is necessary to function and its functioning becomes neurotic whenstatus becomes all important, which is the entering of thought as the “me.” Soknowledge is necessary and yet meditation is to discover, or come upon, or toobserve, an area in which there is no movement of thought. Can the two livetogether, harmoniously, daily?Yoga exercises are excellent to keep the body healthy, and so on. But throughthem you can never come upon the other, never! Because if you give them allimportance, you are not giving importance to the understanding of yourself,which is to be watchful, to be aware, to give attention to what you are doing,every day of your life. That is, to give attention to how you speak and what yousay, to what you think, how you behave, whether you are attached, whether youare frightened, whether you are pursuing pleasure, and so on, to be aware of thewhole movement of thought. If you are and you are really serious about it, thenyou will have established right relationship. Obviously. When all things aboutus are chaotic, when the world is going to pieces, as it is, relationshipbecomes extraordinarily important. When there is the establishing of totalrelationship, whole relationship—not between you and me, but human relationshipwith the whole of the world—then you have the basis for meditation.From there you can go on to behavior, how you behave. If your behavior is basedon pleasure or on reward, it is not behavior. It is merely the pursuit ofpleasure, and from that fear arises. Relationship, behavior, and order areabsolutely essential if you want to go into the question of meditation. If youhave not laid this foundation, then do what you like, stand on your head andbreathe in and out for the next ten thousand years and repeat words, words, butthere will be no meditation. If you have the money, you can go to India. But Ido not know why you go, you will find no enlightenment there. Enlightenment iswhere you are. And where you are, you have to understand yourself. Havingestablished that, laid the foundation there of order—not mechanical order butorder which is virtue from moment to moment, which is not following a pattern,not the order of the establishment, not the order or the virtue of society,which is immoral—then you can go into the question of finding out whatmeditation is.Meditation implies a quality of mind that is absolutely silent. Not madesilence, not a contrived act brought about through will, but a silence thatcomes naturally when you have established order, relationship, and behavior.Silence is necessary. If my mind is chattering, as most minds are, in thatchatter there may be a period of silence. Between two chatterings there may be aperiod of silence. But that is not silence. Silence is not the absence of noise;it is not the absence of conflict. Silence comes only when the content ofconsciousness has been completely understood and gone beyond, which means theobserver and the observed are one and there is no controller. When there is nocontroller—which does not mean that you live a life of nondiscipline—when thereis no controller, no observer, then action is instantaneous and it brings agreat deal of energy.Meditation means the emptying of consciousness of its content and that happensonly when you observe your consciousness and its content without the observer.Can you look at your wife, your husband, your girl, your boy, or the mountain,without the observer? The observer is the past. As long as there is theobserver, he will inevitably translate everything he observes in terms of thepast; therefore, he is the maker of time. He divides the observed and theobserver. In that there is conflict. When there is observation without theobserver, there is no conflict, no past; there is only the fact and you have theenergy to go beyond it. Do it and you will find out.Meditation implies a gathering of all energy. You have established order,relationship, behavior; therefore, you are not dissipating energy in that field.That energy is necessary to look without the observer and you have the energy togo beyond. With that energy, which has not been dissipated, the mind sees thatthere is an area which is not touched by thought. But all this requirestremendous attention and discipline. It is not just a plaything for immaturepeople. Meditation requires tremendous discipline. The word discipline means tolearn—not control, subjugate, imitate, and conform. Discipline means to learn.From the word discipline comes “disciple,” one who is willing to learn from themaster, to learn. But here there is neither a disciple nor a master but only theact of learning, all the time. And that requires a great deal of attention, agreat deal of energy, so that you are watching and thus, you create noillusions. It is so easy to create illusions; they come when you are pursuing,demanding, wanting, an experience. Desire creates illusions.All this implies a mind that is very, very serious and a heart that is of love,that has never been hurt. We human beings, from childhood on, are hurt. Ourparents hurt us, and in the business world we are hurt. We are hurt in everydirection, and when we are hurt we cannot possibly love. So is it possible for amind that has been hurt to be free of all that hurt, which is part ofconsciousness? You will find, when you look at it, that it is utterly andirrevocably possible to empty all hurts and, therefore, to love, to havecompassion. To have compassion means to have passion for all things, not justbetween two people, but for all human beings, for all things of the earth, theanimals, the trees, everything the earth contains. When we have such comparisonwe will not despoil the earth as we are doing now, and we will have no wars.To a mind that is serious, totally dedicated, concerned, meditation meanssomething extraordinary, something immense. In meditation, mind discovers space.Space is held within a room and there is space outside it. Thought as the “me”creates the narrow space in which it acts; it has created, through hurt, throughall kinds of reasons, walls within which it lives. There is that narrow spaceand the space which thought has created outside of itself. Is there a spacewhich has no frontiers, which has no boundaries and, therefore, no center? Thisis meditation, to find out.As long as there is a center, the “me” or the idea of the “me,” with all itsattachments, that very center creates a space around itself. Where there is acenter, there must be a border. The border may be extended, but it is stilllimited by the space that the center has created. Meditation means to come uponthat space in which there is no center; therefore, no direction; therefore, notime. Without meditation and the coming upon that thing which is not able to beexperienced, which is not to be put into words, which has no time, which has nocontinuity, life has very little meaning. You may have a lot of money, or nomoney; you may be attached to your property, to your wife, to your friend, oryou may worship your particular little god, which thought has invented, but aslong as you live there, there will be suffering, pain, anxiety, and violence.And that has no meaning in itself, obviously. Only when you come upon thisspace—not invent it, not project it, not bring it about through any system—thenonly does life have an extraordinary sense of beauty and meaning.Saanen, July 28, 1974"},{"pageContent":"A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD [index_split_001.html#filepos6564]"},{"pageContent":"1 We are the world. The world is you and me, the world is not separate from youand me. We have created this world—the world of violence, the world of wars, theworld of religious divisions, sex, anxieties, the utter lack of communicationwith each other, with no sense of compassion, consideration for another.Wherever one goes in any country throughout the world, human beings, that is,you and another, suffer; we are anxious, we are uncertain, we don’t know what isgoing to happen. Everything has become uncertain. Right through the world ashuman beings we are in sorrow, fear, anxiety, violence, uncertain of everything,insecure. There is a common relationship between us all. We are the worldessentially, basically, fundamentally. The world is you, and you are the world.Realizing that fundamentally, deeply, not romantically, not intellectually butactually, then we see that our problem is a global problem. It is not my problemor your particular problem, it is a human problem.So we are dealing with the human, global problem, which is that you as a humanbeing are living in a disintegrating world. So when we talk about relationship,we are talking about the relationship of man to man. When you understand thatrelationship, then you can come very much closer, which is the relationshipbetween you and your neighbor, you and your wife, you and your son, and so on.Unless you have a global, universal, sense of the whole human being, you willlive merely in fragments, as an American, or a European, a communist, asocialist, a Hindu, or a Buddhist—and all the rest of the divisions that man hasmade. We are concerned with mankind, which is you. Wherever you go, man issuffering, man is afraid, man wants to find out if there is some truthanywhere—if there is any god, if there is anything sacred, whether there is aneternity or only the ending of life and whether man can ever be free from fear,find an end to sorrow.When we say man we mean woman also; let us not quarrel about words, it becomesrather childish.In our examination together, there is no authority, there is no teacher and thetaught, there is no guru and the disciple; therefore, there is no authority. Inthe psychological world, in the world of the spirit, there is no authority. Youare not following the speaker or accepting what he is saying. It is good to havea great deal of skepticism, but that skepticism must be kept on a leash, and youmust know when to let it go and when to hold it. In examining this vast problemof existence, both of us must be very clear and understand that there is noauthority, the one who knows and the other who does not know. Together we arelooking into this. Whether you are capable of looking is a different matter.Whether you are intensely, consistently, pursuing the investigation depends onyou. If you do not have the energy, the intention, the necessary persistence,then you make authority. If you are lazy, indolent, then you give authority toanother. Or if you are disorderly in your life and you see orderliness inanother then you make him into an authority. So, please, we are going togetherto examine without any sense of authority, which means there is freedom to look.Because one of the causes of this disintegrating society in which we live isthat we are followers; we accept spiritual authority, the intermediary, thepriest, the analyst, as our guide in matters of the spirit. We become incapablewhen we give ourselves over to another to find out about ourselves. We don’tseem to be able to look into ourselves and examine very closely the whole ofhuman existence—which is yourself. If we are examining, investigating together,and there is no authority, only freedom to examine, see the beauty of it: thenyou and I have a relationship.In the human being and in the society in which he lives, one of the basic causesof this disintegration, this breaking up, is the utter lack of religious spirit.Religion means accumulating all your energy to investigate truth; to find out,to come upon that state of mind or consciousness in which there is truth that isnot invented by thought. One of the factors of disintegration is the utter lackof the religious mind, and another is the lack of morality—not a Christianmorality, or Hindu morality, or the morality of permissiveness; morality impliesorderliness, basic order. It is not order according to a pattern, according tothe convenience of environment, but an order that comes when you understand thenature of disorder, and that morality is a thing that is living.This disintegrating world is your mind. You are the essence of society, you arethe basis of society in your relationships. And when there is no relationshipthen there is disintegration. So what is relationship? Relationship is the basisof our existence, the basis of our society, and unless there is deepunderstanding of that and a transformation in that relationship, we cannot gofurther into the question of meditation, what is religion, what is truth, and soon. So that is the bedrock upon which we must stand clearly.We must find out what it means to have right relationship, accuraterelationship. The word accurate means factually correct. What is relationship?What does it mean to be related to another—at the physical level, sexual level,psychological level, emotional level, intellectual level, and at the level ofwhat one calls love? If that whole nature and structure of relationship is notunderstood clearly and lived daily, to go to meditate is utterly infantile, hasno meaning, because then meditation becomes merely a futile escape. Unless youestablish right relationship between you and another, that being the very basisof existence, trying to meditate becomes an evasion of the actual that leads toall kinds of neurotic, destructive results.So what is actual relationship in our daily life with each other? If you examineit very closely, and are not afraid, see what is taking place. You have an imageabout yourself, don’t you? You have a picture, an idea, a concept of yourself,and the person you are related to has his or her concept, her image, her pictureabout herself. Please, you are looking at yourself, you are not merely listeningto these words. Words are a mirror, and the mirror becomes useless when you arelooking at yourself actually. So you and the other, man and woman, boy or girl,or husband and wife, and so on, each human being, has a picture, an image, aconclusion, an idea about herself or himself.If you have lived with another for a week, or a hundred weeks, you have made apicture of the other, and the other has made a picture of you. That is a fact,isn’t it? Are you afraid to look at that picture? That picture has been builtthrough many days, many years, many incidents: nagging, pleasure, comfort, fear,domination, possession, attachment, and so on and so on and so on. Each personhas an image of the other. That is an actuality, isn’t it? And you call thatrelationship. That is a relationship between two pictures, between two images.Right? You are not agreeing with the speaker, you are looking at the fact. Thesepictures or images or conclusions are memories, which each has put together,stored up in the brain. And they are reacting to each other according to thoseimages. You have been hurt, and that hurt is a memory, stored up in the brain,and that reacts. So our relationship is not actual but from memories. If you aremarried, you have built a picture about your wife, and the wife has built apicture, an image about you. Those pictures, those images are the nagging, thecasual remarks, the hurts, the pleasures, the comforts, the sexual memories, allthat. And the relationship is between these two verbal pictures in memory; it isnot actual; and, therefore, there is always division and conflict. When you havebeen hurt in that relationship, it is the image you have built about yourselfthat has been hurt.I wonder if you are actually observing it in yourself, or listening to thespeaker and agreeing with the speaker. They are two different facts. If you areagreeing with the speaker, that has very little significance. Do you actuallysee that you have built an image about yourself and that hurt exists because ofthat image?So in this relationship of human beings, hurt has taken place. The image hasbeen hurt. Unless you heal that image totally there must always be conflict.There are past hurts and you may receive further hurts. You have been hurt inthe past; unfortunately this happens from childhood—in school, in college, athome. Right throughout life one is hurt, and because one is hurt, one builds awall around oneself to resist, not to be hurt anymore. And when one builds awall around oneself, division takes place. You may say, “I love you,” but it isjust words, because a division exists.Is it possible not to be hurt at all? Which doesn’t mean build a wall ofresistance so that nothing can touch you, but to live without resistance, whichmeans never to be hurt.Do you know what it means to be hurt? When a child is compared with another,that is a hurt. Any form of comparison hurts. Any form of imitation, conformity,hurts, not only verbally but deeply. And when one is hurt, out of that hurtthere is violence. So is it possible never to be hurt? How are we to deal withpast hurts and prevent future hurts? We will find out.When you say, “I am hurt,” what is this “I” that is hurt? You say, “You havehurt me”—by your word, by a gesture, by discourtesy, and so on and so on—what ishurt? Is it not the image that you have built about yourself? Please, do look atit. That image is one of the factors that society, education, and environmenthave built in you. “You” are that picture, that image, the name, the form, thecharacteristics, the idiosyncrasies, and so on. All that is you, the picture,the image which you are. And that image has been hurt. You have a conclusionabout yourself, that you are this or that, and when that conclusion is disturbedyou are hurt. So can you live without a conclusion, without a picture, withoutan image about yourself? As long as you have an image about yourself, you areeverlastingly hurt. You may resist it, you may build a wall around yourself, butwhen there is a wall around yourself, when you withdraw, there is a division,and where there is a division there must be conflict—as with the Arab and theJew, the Hindu and the Muslim, the communist and the noncommunist. Where thereis a division, it is the law that there must be conflict.So is it possible not to be hurt at all? That is, to have an innocent mind, amind that is incapable of being hurt. It is very important to find out if onecan live that in daily life. Not go off to some monastery or some communitywhere you all agree together, becoming mushy and sentimental, but actually indaily life to find out if you can live without an image and, therefore, never behurt, which means never to have conflict, never to have psychological division.We are going to find out. We are going to examine whether it is possible to livethat way.First be aware that one has this image. When I have an image about myself andthat is hurt, and my wife has an image about herself and she is hurt, how can wehave any kind of relationship? So is it possible not to have an image, whichmeans not to be hurt? One has been hurt in the past, and one has resisted it,built a wall around oneself, is frightened of being hurt more; therefore,withdraws, becomes isolated. Now how will you deal with the past hurts? Will youanalyze why you have been hurt, the causes of your hurt. Will you go into itanalytically?Look at the analytical tradition. We have accepted analysis as part of our life.If you cannot analyze yourself you go to the professional. What is the processof analysis? There is the analyzer and the analyzed. See the division already.But is not the analyzer the analyzed? So you have created an artificial divisionbetween the analyzer and the analyzed, but in actuality the analyzer is theanalyzed. So there is a fundamental error in the process of analysis. And in theprocess of analysis you take time—days, months, years—playing the game andenriching each other in your own peculiar ways, financially and emotionally, andall the rest of it. So, realizing that fundamental error in the process ofanalysis, how is one to be free of all the past hurts, and any hurts that maycome in the future?The speaker and you are sharing this question, to find out actually, in dailylife, whether it is possible to live without a single hurt, because then youwill know what love is.Hurt and flattery are the same, aren’t they? Both are different forms of hurts.You are flattered, and you like it, and the flatterer becomes your friend. Sothat also is another form of encouraging the image. The one you want, the otheryou don’t want. We are now dealing only with what we don’t want, which is not tobe hurt; but we want the other, which is pleasurable, which is comforting,pleasing to the images that we have. So both are the same. Now how am I, how isa human being, to be free of hurt? So we have to go into the question of what itis to be attentive.What does it mean to attend? If you know what it means to attend, it may solvethe problem. Have you ever given total attention to anything? Complete attentionin which there is no center from which you attend? When there is a center fromwhich you attend then there is a division. Let’s put it differently. You knowwhat it is to be aware. One is aware of the trees under which we are sitting,aware of the branches, the color of the branches and their thickness, of theleaves, the shadows, aware of all the nature, the beauty of it. [The Ojai talkstook place in the open in a grove of oaks.] Then you are also aware of sittingon the ground, the color of the carpet, the microphone. And can you be aware ofall this, the microphone, the carpet, the earth, the color of the leaves, and soon, the blue shirt, be aware of all that without any choice? To look at itwithout any choice, judgment, just to look.If you can look without any judgment, without any choice, just observe, in thatobservation there is no observer. The moment the observer comes in prejudicebegins, the like and the dislike, “I prefer this, I don’t prefer that,” divisiontakes place. So there is attention only when there is no entity who says, “I amattending.” Please, it is important to understand this. Because if there isattention, when there is an awareness in which there is no choice, no judgment,merely observation, then you will see you will never be hurt again, and the pasthurts are wiped away. But the moment the observer comes in then the observergets hurt.So, when there is complete attention, there is no hurt. If someone says thespeaker is a fool or arrogant; in listening to the word and giving completeattention to it, there is no past hurt or future hurt because there is no entitywho is observing. Please, this is very important, because as long as there is adivision there must be conflict. It is very important, in dealing with fear,with pleasure, with sorrow, with death, to see that as long as there is adivision between the observer, the experiencer, the thinker and the thought,there must inevitably be conflict, division, fragmentation and, therefore,disintegration. So can you observe the tree, yourself, your neighbor, observelife completely attentively? Then can you observe with total attention thepicture that you have about yourself? And when you give that complete attentionis there a picture at all?When there is no image, no picture, no conclusion, then what is the relationshipbetween two human beings? Now our relationship is based on division, which is anobvious fact. The man goes to the office where he is brutal and ambitious,greedy; then he comes home and he says, “Darling, how lovely you are.” So thereis contradiction in our life and, therefore, our life is a constant battle and,therefore, there is no relationship. To have real human relationship is to haveno image whatsoever, no picture, no conclusion. And it is quite complex, becauseyou have memories. Can you be free of memories of yesterday’s incidents? Allthat is implied. Then what is the relationship between two human beings who haveno images? You will find out if you have no image. That may be love.So can one live, actually in daily life, without division; which means withoutwar, without conflict?Ojai, April 3, 1976"},{"pageContent":"2 All our life is based on thinking. All our actions are the result of thought,either from the deep past, or from immediate necessities according toenvironment. Thought guides our whole life. Thought has divided us into nations,classes, into religious sects, beliefs—with their dogmas, rituals. Thought hasbuilt the churches—Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, and the various Easternreligious structures and propaganda. I think this is irrefutable fact.What is thought? Why has it become such an extraordinarily important factor inour life? Our education, our relationship is based on thought, on image, verbalstructure. It is all put together by thought. Why is it that thought has becomeso persistent, continuous, and divisive?In examining why thought has become so extraordinarily important, we have alsoto go into the question of consciousness. Consciousness is filled with thoughtand the things of thought. Whether it is conscious or unconscious, deep down itis still the movement of thought, from the past, meeting the present, andcreating the future. All that is the movement of thought. Movement implies time.Thought implies measurement. So thought is a movement, time and measure. What isthe process of thought? What is the nature and the structure of thought? That isour life: we act, we live according to certain patterns laid down by thought,consciously or unconsciously, deep down. It seems extraordinarily important tounderstand thought because thought has divided people, nationally,geographically, according to their beliefs, according to their dogmas. Thoughthas built up the whole memorial structure as the “me” and the “you,” the ego,the personality, and so on.We are trying to find out if there is another consciousness that is not puttogether by thought and, therefore, we must examine this consciousness as weknow it, which is filled with the things of thought. What is the source ofthinking? Why is thinking, thought, fragmentary? From where does thought come?What is the nature of consciousness, and why is that consciousness filled withall this movement of thought? One must discover for oneself what is thebeginning of thought.Isn’t thought a reaction of memory? Memory is knowledge stored up as experience.There is an experience, knowledge of that experience as memory, and the responseof that memory is thinking. So the source of thinking is in the past. So thoughtsprings from the past. If you examine it, all our lives are based in the past,our roots are in the past. Knowledge is the past, there is no knowledge of thefuture, or of the present. There is knowledge of the present only when there isa complete understanding of what the structure and the nature of the past is—andending it.So thought is the response of the movement from the past. The past is stored upin the brain as experience and knowledge. And why is thought fragmentary? Whyhas thought built divisions between people—as Christians, Buddhists, communists,socialists, capitalists, believers and nonbelievers, and so on? Is there anaction that is not based on thought, that is not divisive, that is notfragmentary, in which there is no regret, pain, sorrow? The fragmentary processis seen in our daily life as the “me” and the “you,” “we” and “they,” theChristian, the non-Christian, and so on and so on and so on. That fragment ofthought may think there is God, but God then is still the product of a fragment.Thought has filled our consciousness with its own fragments, and then thoughtsays, “I must go beyond this fragment, I must find enlightenment, I must findGod, I must find truth, I must find Nirvana,” whatever you like to call it. Afragment is trying to understand that which is whole—that which is sane,healthy, holy—the word whole implies all that. So the fragment has been tryingto grasp or come upon that which is whole. So it meditates, it controls, ittries to follow a system in order to arrive at that, but it is still themovement of time as a fragment in measure.So why is thought a fragment? Why has it become a fragment? Why has thoughtdivided you and me, we and they, the Buddhist, communist, socialist? Can thoughtsee the whole? Can thought see itself as a fragment? Or can it never see itself,see its own limitation, see its own fragmentary movement and, therefore, neversee the whole.Now leave it there for the moment and we will come to it in a different way.Does one realize, see that one’s consciousness is its content? The content ofconsciousness makes consciousness. If you are a Christian, the content of yourconsciousness, all the beliefs, the dogmas, the rituals, the reactions, theattachments, the anxieties, the fears, the sorrows, the aspirations, the imageswhich you have built about yourself and about others, all your conclusions, yourprejudices, all that is the content of your consciousness. It is so. So yourconsciousness is made up of the things it contains. And the content ofconsciousness is filled by the things of thought—your scholastic knowledge, theknowledge of your own experiences, prejudices, and so on. So your consciousnessis fragmentary. And within that area we are trying to find reality, truth, byexpanding it, trying to go beyond it.Are you just accepting my words or are you observing for yourself, watching thecontent of your own consciousness, and seeing that it is filled with all thethings that you have accumulated? Not only the things you have accumulated, butwhat the past generations have accumulated—the traditions, the manner ofbehaving. All that is your consciousness, and because it is fragmentary and,therefore, divisive, it must always be in conflict. Thought realizes this andthen says to itself, “I must go beyond it”—through meditation, through control,through suppression, through various forms of enlarging consciousness. This isthe game we are playing all the time, holding on to our content, and trying togo beyond it.So thought cannot see the whole, because it is fragmentary. If thought could seethe whole it would be the whole, it would not make an effort to be the whole—thewhole being healthy, not divisive, sane, and holy. But it is not. Now, theobserver is fragmentary; it says, “I am conscious of the limitations of mythought.” That observer is the past and the past, which is fragmentary, makesevery action fragmentary. The past is the knowledge, experience, all the thingsthat human beings have gathered together for centuries and centuries. And wethink the ascent of man lies through knowledge. One questions whether knowledgeis the instrument of ascent, although various professors and experts sayknowledge is the way because knowledge is the past. The movement of thought istime, and we think time will make us progress, evolve, grow, but time is alsofragmentary.There are two kinds of time: physical, chronological time by thewatch—yesterday, today, and tomorrow—and the psychological time of “I will be,”a psychological tomorrow, where I shall be able to achieve enlightenment, whereI will be perfect. But is there psychological time at all, or is it still theinvention of thought? We are trying to find out if there is an action that isnot based on the past and, therefore, divisive. Is there an action that iscomplete, whole, not caught in the net of time?After seeing the action, the movement that is going on in the world—and inourselves, which is the world—one wants to find out if there is an action notbased on a conclusion—because conclusion is the movement of thought—action thatis not based on an ideal, which is again fragmentary, action not based on aprejudice, an action that is every moment whole, complete, so that in thataction there are no regrets, no sorrows, no pain. Don’t you want to find such anaction? We live with action that is painful, in which there is alwaysuncertainty, regrets—”I wish I hadn’t done that.” One knows the action thatbrings regret, pain, sorrow, confusion, and so on, and one wants to find out ifthere is an action that is whole and, therefore, complete; into which none ofthe regrets, or the poisonous movements, enter. I think this is what whatever isintelligent in a human being demands, and not being able to find it one inventsan outside agency—if I can reach God, then I will know complete action. He willnever reach God because God is his own invention! So we are going to find out ifthere is an action that is whole, sane, healthy, rational and, therefore, holy.Why has thought invented an ideal? The ideal is the opposite of what is. Theideal is in the future, and what is is actual. One does not know how to dealwith the actual, how to understand it, how to go beyond it and, therefore, notbeing able to understand it, one projects an ideal, which is fictitious, whichis not actual. So there is the division between what is and the ideal and,hence, conflict. Thought, being fragmentary, is not capable of understandingwhat is actually in the present. It thinks it will understand by creating anideal and trying to follow that ideal and, therefore, it brings more and moreconflict. But if one is capable of looking at the present, the actual, the whatis. without the principle, without the ideal, without the observer, who is thepast, then one meets the actual.Can one look at what is without a prejudice, without prejudgment? Can you lookat what is without the observer, who is the past? Say you are envious of people,how do you look at that envy? Are you looking at it as an observer who isdifferent from envy? You look at it as though you are separate from envy, butthe fact is that you are envy. You are not the observer who is different; theobserver himself is that. So the observer is the observed. Please, this isreally very important to understand. When you have grasped the truth that theobserver is the observed, then that which is observed undergoes radical change.What prevents a radical change of what is is the interference of the observer,who is the past. To understand this removes all conflict.We are educated to conform to the division of the observer and the observed, andthe observer is always trying to do something about the observed. He says, “I amenvious; I will find it reasonable to be envious; if I am not envious what willhappen in society?”; I suppress it, rationalize it, or justify it, which are alla process of conflict. Out of that conflict we have all kinds of violence. Butthe actual fact is that the observer is the observed. And, therefore, thedivision ends. When there is only observation of the fact, the fact undergoesradical transformation. So can one live a life in which there is no conflictwhatsoever? That is to be perfectly sane. It is the unbalanced, the insane, whoare always in conflict.So one wants to find a way of living in which there is no conflict, in whichthought, which is the movement in time as measure, which creates division, canrealize its own limitation and function where it is absolutely necessary, andnot enter into the psychological field at all. Thought has built the psyche, thepsychological states, which is me, my ego. And thought is fragmentary;therefore, what it has created, the “me,” is fragmentary. Then thought says, “Imust integrate with the whole”—which is an impossibility. So can thoughtrealize, itself, that it is a fragment, and that whatever movement it makes mustbe fragmentary? Can it realize that there is an action that is not fragmentary,which can only take place when the observer is the observed, and that in that,that which is undergoes a radical change.Our consciousness is filled with the things of thought and, therefore, ourconsciousness is fragmentary. Is there a consciousness that is not fragmentary,and can thought find it? Is there a consciousness that is not put together bythought? We have divided the universe as the “me” and the “you,” “we” and“they,” good and evil. We have divided it, that is, thought has divided it. Andthen thought says to itself, “Is there a consciousness that is not put togetherby me?” Now how are you, a human being, going to find out if there is aconsciousness that is not put together by thought? Man has tried this formillennia. It isn’t just now that we are trying it. He has said there must beanother consciousness that is not this kind of consciousness. And so he says, “Imust control thought; there must be a system by which thought can be controlled,and then when thought is controlled, held, perhaps I will know what the otheris.” And this is the whole basis of meditation: control thought. But he doesn’task who the controller is. The controller is still thought.So, to find out, to come upon that which is not put together by thought, we haveto understand the place of thought as knowledge and where thought has no placewhatsoever, without suppressing it. Thought has a place as knowledge in ourdaily, superficial activities: driving a car, working in a factory, writing. Itis only possible to give knowledge its right place when you have understood thewhole nature of thinking. The psyche, the “me,” has been put together bythought—my virtue, my temperament, my desires, my ambitions, my peculiaridiosyncrasies, my experience as opposed to your experience. Those are all theresult of thought. Thought as knowledge has its right place, but it has no placein the psyche. That means, can the mind, can this whole structure of the psychecease to be? Then only is there a totally different kind of consciousness—whichyou will never find through meditation.All the things that thought has put together is reality. But thought has not puttogether the mountain or the tree, and that is also a reality. All the gods, allthe rituals, all the mischief that is being made in the world by thought, is areality—war is a reality, killing people is a reality, the violence, thebrutality, the callousness, the destruction, is a reality made by thought, puttogether by thought. The mountains, the trees, the rivers, the beauty of thesky, is a reality but it is not put together by thought. Belief is a reality puttogether by thought but it is neurotic. The neuroticism is a reality. And truthis not reality. Thought can never touch truth. Then what is the relationshipbetween truth and reality?We have examined the nature of thought. We said thought is a material process,matter, because it is stored up in the brain, part of the cell, which is matter.So thought is a material process in time, in movement. And whatever thatmovement creates is reality—the neurotic as well as the so-called fragmentaryare realities. The actual is a reality, like the microphone. And nature is alsoa reality. So what is truth? Can thought, which is fragmentary, which is caughtup in time, mischievous, violent, find truth, truth being the whole, that whichis sacred, holy? And if it cannot find it, then what is the relationship ofthought, of reality, to that which is absolute?You know, all this demands meditation. This is real meditation, not the thingsimported into this country by the gurus. Can consciousness, which is itscontent, ever expand to include consciousness of truth? Or does thisconsciousness of the psyche, the “me” with all its content, have to end beforethe perception of what is truth. One has to find out what is the nature of thepsyche, which has been put together by thought. What is “me”—the vanity, thearrogance, the desire to achieve, to become successful—to which one clings sodesperately? What is the nature of it? How has it come about? Because if thatexists, the other cannot be. If I am egotistic, as long as that psychic centerexists, truth cannot possibly be, because truth is the whole.So how is the mind—the mind being all the senses, the emotions, the memories,the prejudices, the principles, the ideals, memories, experiences, the totalityof that, which is the psyche, which is the me—how is that to end and yet act inthis world? Is that possible?To find that out one must go very deeply into the question of fear, the verycomplex problem of pleasure, and the question of sorrow and whether sorrow canever end. Man has lived with sorrow for millennia upon millennia. He hasn’t beenable to end it. And one must also go into the question of what is death andlove. Because all that is the matrix of the me. So this is a very, very seriousaffair, it is not just a thing to be played with. One must give one’s whole lifeto understand this. To live in this world completely, sanely, without thepsyche; not escape, not go off into some monastery or commune, but to live here,in this mad, insane, and murderous world where there is so much corruption,where politics are divorced from ethics. To live in this world sanely, withoutthe psyche, the “me,” is a tremendous challenge. That requires a mind that canthink meticulously, correctly, objectively, having all the senses fullyawakened, not drugged by alcohol, speed, and all the rest of it. You must have avery healthy mind, and when it is drugged or smoking, drinking, you do not havea healthy mind; all that destroys the mind, makes the mind dull.Ojai, April 4, 1976"},{"pageContent":"3 If one single human being understands radically the problem of fear and resolvesit, not tomorrow or some other day but instantly, he affects the wholeconsciousness of mankind. That is a fact. As we have said, your consciousness isnot your private property, it is the result of time, of thousands of incidents,experiences, that are put together by thought. That consciousness is in constantmovement. It is like a stream, a vast river of which you are a part. So there isno particularization; and if you go into it very deeply, there is noindividuality. You may not like that, but look at it. Individual means an entitywho is undivided, indivisible, who is not fragmented, who is not broken up butis a whole being. But most of us, unfortunately, are fragmented, broken up,divided, like the rest of the world—unhappy, concerned, confused, miserable,aching, frightened.So we are going together to explore the question of fear and whether it can end.We are sharing it together. Fear can be very little or an enormous burden. Thereis fear of losing a job, fear of not being successful, fear of death, fear ofnot being loved, fear of loneliness, isolation, fear of deep insecurity, thefear of being dependent, fear of not doing the right thing, or the fear offollowing the rest of the crowd, or being left behind. You know what fears are.Man has never been able psychologically to be free of fears. Fear has burdenedhis mind, darkened his outlook. He does not know how to deal with these fears;therefore, he escapes from them into violence, brutality, arrogance, bitterness.What is the root cause of fear? Please look into yourself. Use the words as amirror to discover your own fear and as you observe find out the root of it; notthe branches, the leaves, the trivialities of fear, but the fundamental cause offear. Because if there is fear psychologically, inwardly, every action becomesdistorted, and there is no meticulous, clear observation.What is the root of fear? Is it not being able to find complete security,psychologically, inwardly? Complete, total certainty, security Is it that we areseeking permanency, something that will endure, that will last, that is final?Is there the uncertainty of not being? First let us see if there is securitypsychologically; because we may be seeking psychological security and,therefore, creating insecurity in the outward world. What is security,psychologically, inwardly? What do we mean by being secure, having firm,certain, enduring, unshakable, immovable, security so that nothing can shake it,break it down? Is that what you are seeking in relationship between each other?Having complete knowledge and depending on that knowledge to give us stability?That means seeking permanency, something that nothing can change and, therefore,eternity in the sense of putting an end to time.So, is time one of the factors of fear? There is time by the watch, time asyesterday, today, and tomorrow. Chronological time is necessary, it is there. Isthere psychological time? Is there for me, for you, psychologically, tomorrow?If there is not, there is immense fear. If you are confronted with the fact thatthere is no tomorrow psychologically, your whole foundation is shaken; becausetomorrow you are going to have greater pleasure, tomorrow you will be better,tomorrow you will achieve, tomorrow you will get rid of your fear. Sopsychologically is there tomorrow?Tomorrow means time. Tomorrow implies thought, which is in itself fragmentary;it has created psychological time, in which you will move from what is to “whatshould be.” So is time a factor of fear? Time exists, but is there time at allpsychologically: to make an effort to be something? Or, is fear of not being?What is this everlasting demand for self-expression, the “me” expressing itself,the “me” and the “you,” the “I,” the ego? Tackle this, because it is your life,and if you understand this and are free of fear, you open the door to heaven.What is this “me” that says, “I must be,” “I must meditate,” “I must find God,”“I must realize,” “I must be happy,” “I am lonely,” “I must be successful,” “Iam frightened,” “I must be told”? Is it not the name, Mr. So-and-so, the form,the form being the body that you see in the mirror, and all the associatedmemories, all the concepts about yourself, the image about yourself, the imagethat says, “I am much better than you are”? Are they not all put together bythought? Thought itself is a fragment, and the activity of that fragment is notonly the “me,” but the fragments it has created all round you—separate nations,separate classes, wars, the whole of that. And thought is a material process intime. Thought is the response of memory, experience, knowledge, stored up in thebrain.So the “me” to which we cling is fictitious. That may be the root cause of fear,clinging to something that is nonexistent. So, there is the fictitious, imaginedme, a picture, a symbol, an idea, an image, put together by thought in time,which is a material process, measurement. And that “me,” being uncertain of itsvery existence, deeply, in the very depths of one’s being, may be the deepfundamental cause of fear. That doesn’t mean that if you have no “me” you cannotlive in this world. On the contrary.Now can you look at the movement of time? Time is movement. The ending of thatmovement is putting a stop to time. That is one of the major factors ofmeditation, so that time comes to an end, psychologically. So deep rooted fearis the movement of thought in time, which is a material process, which hascreated an artificial structure called the “me,” and having created it clings toit. Thought clings to a fragment that it has created, and thought itself is afragment. There is fear in relationship, because in relationship we have createdthe image of you and me. The man and the woman each has an image of the other, apicture, a symbol, put together by time, of many days, many years, or an hour.And their relationship is between these two images. Look into it and you willsee the actuality of it. We cling to the picture, to the image, and we arefrightened of losing that image. So we are forced to look at each other totallydifferently if there is no image.We have described in words the nature, the quality, the structure, of this thingcalled fear. Now, knowing that the description is not the described, can youlook not at the description but at the fact? Can you look at it? That is, canyou observe it?It is very important to learn how to observe. There is an art in observation.“Art” means putting things in their proper place, putting everything where itbelongs. Can you observe this thing called fear? Are you, the observer,different from the thing observed? When you are angry, or envious, or jealous,or whatever it is, are you different from that feeling which we have named as“jealousy”? Or you are jealousy? So the observer is the observed. To put itdifferently, is the thinker different from his thought? Or again differently, isthe experiencer different from the experience? If he is not different, then whydo you seek experiences? If there is no difference between the observer and theobserved, then there is only the observed. Then there is only thinking, not thethinker different from thought.You want experiences. You are bored with the experiences that you have hadalready, the daily experiences of sex, this, that, and the other, so you wantother experiences—experience of god, experience of enlightenment, experience ofJesus, experience of Krishna consciousness. And you have never asked who theexperiencer is, and whether he is different from the experienced. You want toexperience Krishna consciousness, or the consciousness of Jesus, or somethingelse, but to experience that, you must recognize it, mustn’t you? That means youhave already known it. Therefore, the experiencer is the experienced.So can you look at fear without the observer? Because you are the fear, fearisn’t different from you. When you are angry, is that anger different from you?If you say it is different, then you try to control it, then you try torationalize it, then you try to do something about it. But if the observer isthe observed, you can’t do anything about it, you are that. So observe fearwithout the observer.One realizes in observing that fear is not different from the observer. When theobserver is the observed there is fundamental change in that which is observed.When there is division between the observer and the observed, in that divisionthere is conflict. I say I must get rid of it, I must control it, or ask whyshould I not have fear, why should I not have neurotic actions out of thosefears. There is always contradiction, division, and, therefore, conflict—whichis a wastage of energy. It is a wastage of energy when there is conflict, tryingto control, running away, going to somebody to tell me how to get rid of fear.All those are factors of wasting energy. If you don’t waste energy—and that onlytakes place when the observer is the observed—then you have that immense energyto transform what is. The very observation is the energy which transforms “thatwhich is.” Get this, and then you will see that you are completely free frompsychological fears.If you have listened with all your heart and your mind, then when you get up youare free of fear. That means you have listened. That means it is your problemand it is absolutely necessary to solve it, not tomorrow, but instantly. Thatis, when you perceive something, then you act instantly, and that perception isonly possible when the perceiver is the perceived, because there you have totalenergy. Total observation is only possible when there is no observer—theobserver being the past. When there is that total attention given toobservation, that which is observed undergoes a fundamental transformation. Gotit? Do it!Ojai, April 10, 1976"},{"pageContent":"4 Why does the human mind pursue pleasure? We are not saying that there should notbe pleasure, but we are going to investigate into the nature of pleasure becauseapparently human beings are everlastingly committed to pleasure. Why is therethis great demand for pleasure, the easiest way of action, the most comfortableway of living, the pursuit not only of physical, sensory pleasures, butpsychological pleasures? And the ultimate pleasure is God, enlightenment. Whatis pleasure? It may be the other side of the coin of fear. Most human beingsdisregard fear, do not know how to deal with fear, and pursue pleasureconstantly.Through culture, through tradition, through our habits, the environment, and soon, part of our brain has become mechanistic. Is pleasure mechanistic? Is it therepetition of a certain delight of yesterday, either sexual or otherwise, whichbecomes a memory, and we pursue the memory as pleasure? We are concerned withthe transformation of the human mind. We cannot live as we are living. Theremust be a radical change in our minds, in our hearts, in our whole way ofliving, and so it is very important to find out why we human beings have beencaught in this everlasting pursuit of pleasure.Now look at it. Yesterday there were some delightful incidents, something thatyou liked immensely happened. That is registered in the brain, it becomes amemory. Then thought says, “I must have more of that.” It is the repetition ofan incident which is over, which was considered pleasure by thought, the pursuitof it today and tomorrow. That is mechanistic, mechanical, obviously.What is the difference between pleasure, enjoyment, and joy? There are threethings: pleasure, enjoyment, and joy. You can cultivate pleasure—taste, allsensory activities. Can you cultivate enjoyment? Or can you cultivate joy? Joycomes uninvited, by some curious chance. You find yourself suddenly,extraordinarily, unspeakably happy. Then thought takes it over and says, “I musthave more of it.” So the moment thought interferes with that thing called joy,which is uninvited, it becomes pleasure. Therefore, it becomes mechanistic.So that is our life, a way of living, that is constantly repetitive, constantlygoing over something that was, that is already dead, making it live throughthought and pursuing that as pleasure. You can look at something beautiful, thetrees and the clouds and the light. But when thought comes in and says, “Thatwas a most lovely thing,” it is already finished. So can you watch the beauty ofnature, the beauty of this world, with all your senses and not let thought comein? Then enjoyment is completely for the moment, but when thought takes it over,it becomes pleasure and it becomes mechanistic. Please, this requires a mindwith a tremendous sense of alertness, watchfulness, awareness. Experiment withit now as we are talking. Look at the trees, the sunlight, the beauty of thehills, the shadows, the playing of those shadows among the hills, the valleys.It is a delight. Can you watch it without thought coming into it, and end itthere, not wanting to continue it? What has continuity becomes mechanistic. Inthat which has an ending, there is a new beginning. Got it?Now, you had an insight into this, didn’t you? Please, watch it carefully. Youhad an insight; is that insight the product of thought? So you have foundsomething. That is, when there is an insight and action through insight, it isnot mechanistic. Insight or intelligence is not the product of thought; it isnonmechanistic action. Whenever thought takes over the moment of delight, itbecomes mechanistic. You saw that. The perception of that is intelligence, isn’tit? Can you act always according to that intelligence, not according to therepetitive movement of thought? Do you see the difference?So we see the movement of pleasure, based upon desire, desire being sensation.To watch the trees, the clouds, the heavens and the stars and the moon, is atremendous sensation if you watch it with all your senses. Then thought comesin. So where there is sensation plus thought there is a desire. That is, thesensations, the activity of the senses at their highest, plus thought, isdesire. Do you see that? How do you see it? You see it because your intelligenceis observing it. That intelligence is not the product of thought.Have you considered why human beings suffer, both biologically as well asinwardly, why there are tears? What is this suffering, this sorrow? Can it everend, or is it an everlasting movement from the beginning of mankind to our end?Must man put up with it, live with it?Organized religions, based on authority and belief, have never solved thisproblem. Christianity says somebody suffered for you, and you carry on. Hindusand the Buddhists have their own explanations. So man has lived with sorrow fromthe most ancient days. Can sorrow end? If there is no ending to sorrow, there isno compassion, there is no love. We think suffering is necessary, or we thinkthere is no solution to suffering; therefore, we must escape from it. And wehave developed a marvelous network of escapes.What is sorrow? There is this thing called sorrow, which is pain, grief,loneliness, a sense of total isolation, no hope, no sense of relationship orcommunication, total isolation. Mankind has lived with this great thing andperhaps cultivated it because he does not know how to resolve it. We are goingto find out if there is an end to sorrow, because without the ending of sorrowthere is no love. When there is love will you suffer for another? When there islove will there be sorrow? You might have sympathy, kindliness, generosity,sharing, but love is something totally different, a different dimension, whichone can come upon only when sorrow ends.There is sorrow when someone dies whom you “love.” You feel utterly lonely whenyou have lost someone upon whom you have depended. When you feel that you cannotclimb the ladder of success, when someone whom you think you love does notreturn it, when your beliefs, in which you have false security, are shattered;when your mother or father dies, or son or brother dies, there is sorrow.What actually takes place when you suffer? Not biologically, physiologically,but psychologically, which is much more penetrating, much deeper, much moreexcruciating. You may shed tears, escape from it, never look at it, but it isalways there. Sorrow is the lot of human beings, everyone knows it. We escapefrom it, rationalize it, justify it, or say that every human being suffers so Imust suffer. Or if you are prejudiced religiously, you say it is the work ofGod. Now all those are ways and means of escaping from the fact of what is.which is sorrow. Now if you don’t escape, that is, if there is no rationalizing,no avoiding, no justifying, just remaining with that totality of suffering,without the movement of thought, then you have all that energy to comprehend thething that you call sorrow.If you remain without a single movement of thought, with that which you havecalled sorrow, there comes a transformation in that which you have calledsorrow. That becomes passion. The root meaning of sorrow is passion. When youescape from it, you lose that quality which comes from sorrow, which is completepassion, which is totally different from lust and desire. When you have aninsight into sorrow and remain with that thing completely, without a singlemovement of thought, out of that comes this strange flame of passion. And youmust have passion, otherwise you can’t create anything.Out of passion comes compassion. Compassion means passion for all things, forall human beings. So there is an ending to sorrow, and only then you will beginto understand what it means to love.So one has to have an insight into fear, insight into relationship, insight intothe whole structure and nature of thought, thought that breeds fear, thatpursues pleasure, and into the ending of sorrow. If you have an insight into allthat, you have that intelligence that transforms your mechanistic activity intosomething totally nonmechanistic. Don’t go away and think about it! You have notime. When you think about what has been said, then your thinking becomestraditional, mechanistic, and empty, but as you are sitting there, sharing thisthing, it is happening now. It must happen now, otherwise it will not everhappen, because thought will prevent it. Thought has no insight. Have an insightinto what we have pointed out, knowing the description is not the described, andit must take place instantly, now. Thinking about it is just a waste of time.When you are sharing something, you are sharing it now.Ojai, April 11, 1976"},{"pageContent":"5 We have loaded the word love with so much meaning, mostly sensual. Using thatword, knowing all the complications of that word, the meaning of that word, wemust explore together the structure and the nature of that thing called love.Is love desire or pleasure? What is desire and how does it arise? How does itflower? What is the root of it? How does it come into being? Apparently for mostof us love is intimately connected with desire—sexually, psychologically,biologically, and spiritually. The objects of desire vary, but the root ofdesire is the same. So how does desire come into being in each one of us?Religions based on belief, religions of authority, which are not religion atall, have said that to serve God you must be free of desire. So the monks, theIndian sannyasis, try to suppress desire, and in the process of repressionidentify themselves with an image, with a name, and thereby think they havesolved the problem. They are burning inside with desire but they suppress itthrough rituals, through discipline, through every form of conformity, effort.This has been a great problem for human beings who are very serious to find outif there is truth, because desire breeds illusion. Desire breeds experiences,and when you cling to an experience, that becomes an illusion. We haveidentified love with desire.Is not desire sensation—that is, the activity of the senses, plus thought?Sensations plus thought is desire. Is that fact or just a statement of an idea?Can you look at something with all your senses completely? And in that lookingend it and not let thought come into the activity of sensation? That is, whenyou look at the trees, the mountains, the face of a human being, the endlessmovement of the sea, with all your senses, all your eyes and ears and nerves,can you look at it completely and not allow thought to come in, to interferewith it? Then your perception is whole, whereas when thought interferes withthat perception, it becomes fragmentary. So desire is fragmentary.Unfortunately, or fortunately—it is up to you—we have identified desire withthat thing called love. Is love desire? Is love attachment? When you areattached to something you are that. When you have totally identified withsomething, you are that. Why is there this urge to identify, to be attached? Whyis one human being attached to another? Does not attachment breed fear, fear oflosing what one is attached to? Being attached, you may become jealous,frightened, anxious, which are obvious phenomena. You are attached because ofyour own insufficiency, loneliness. And so out of your own insufficiency,loneliness, a sense of lacking, you cling to another. So is attachment love?Where there is attachment there must be exploitation. And we use that word loveto cover up all this. And is love jealousy?None of these things exist as attachment when you have understood that thatemptiness in yourself can never be filled by something else. You have to look atit. You have to not escape from it, observe it totally. Then you will see thatloneliness goes completely away. Then there is not that lonely attachment. Thenperhaps one will know what love is. In attachment there is fear, there isanxiety, there is hate, all the conflicts in relationship; and where there isconflict can there be love? Where there is ambition, can there be love? When youstrip yourself of ambition, anxiety, attachment, and understand deeply themeaning and the significance of pleasure and desire, then you perhaps come uponthat strange thing called love. And out of that comes compassion. Compassion isthe highest form of intelligence. When you have compassion and, therefore,intelligence, you will do the right thing at the right moment. I hope you arefollowing, not verbally, but actually in your hearts, in your minds, doing it.And there is the question of what death is. It is rather strange to talk aboutit on a lovely morning, but it is part of life. Not to go into the full meaningof that word, and know what it implies, to shut ourselves away from it, toescape from it, to avoid it, not to talk about it, is to divide life, which is atotal movement. We must go into this question. Not only for the aged, but alsofor the young; we are all involved in this. So what does living mean, and whatdoes dying mean? What do we mean by living, our daily living? An effort, astruggle, a conflict, pleasure, anxiety, uncertainty, fear of losing a job, orhaving a job, trying to get a better job, and so on, constant struggle, constanteffort, fear, anxiety, with occasional joy—this is our life, if you are honestabout it. This is our everyday existence. To that endless struggle we cling, andsay that is living.And what then is dying? The ending of this so-called living? Is it a biologicalending? Or the ending of this immense stream which man has created of conflict,sorrow, pain, anxiety? Please, it is your life we are talking about, not adescription of the speaker’s life, or somebody else’s life. It is your life,your daily life with which we are concerned. Unless there is a radicaltransformation in that daily life we are going to create more and more miseryfor ourselves and for other human beings, which is actually what is going on. Sowhat is dying?There is a biological death through accident, through disease. And the body, theorganism, wears itself out and comes to an end. The body has its ownintelligence, but we have destroyed that intelligence through drink, throughdrugs, through constant effort, battle. Through various drugs and chemicals,medicines, we have destroyed that innate intelligence of the organism, and sothe body dies by constant strain, usage.Is it possible for the organism, this biological instrument with its brain,never to deteriorate? Our brain as it gets older deteriorates. Can the brain beyoung all the time and not deteriorate? When there is constant friction,constant effort, constant struggle, biologically as well as psychologically, thebrain must deteriorate. Is there a way of living without effort and so the brainis always young, fresh, active, decisive. It is possible. Is one aware daily ofthe constant battle in oneself—trying to be something, trying to imitate, tryingto conform, becoming the ideal, which is the mechanical process? Do you know,are you conscious that you are doing this? Don’t ask how to stop it, how tobreak the mechanical routine, but be aware of it without any choice, just lookat it, because if you introduce an effort you have already destroyed it. Can youobserve without any choice the mechanical movement of the brain, or rather onepart of the brain that has been cultivated for centuries upon centuries to actmechanically? Just be aware of it, not try to correct it, not try to alter it,because from trying to alter it comes conflict. As we said, where there isduality, difference between the observer and the observed, there must beconflict. When there is no observer but merely observation then there is noconflict.If you are totally aware during the day of all the mechanical movement, the waysof your thinking, desire, then you will find at night when you go to sleep, inspite of what all the scientists say, there are no dreams. The mind, the brainis quiet because all your problems, all your activities have been dissolvedduring the day, if you are attentive, are watchful, aware. Then when you go tosleep there is peace; the brain may be in movement but it is a quiet movement,it is not an agitated, anxious movement. Therefore, the brain brings order initself, so the brain becomes young, fresh. It cannot be young and fresh anddecisive if there is any form of hurt. When it is free of hurt, the brain has noresistance.Apart from the biological ending of the organism, what is death? What is it thatyou are so frightened of? Is it the ending of your experiences? The ending ofyour knowledge? The ending of all the things that you are attached to,psychologically? Biologically, when death takes place, whatever you are attachedto does end. You are not going to carry your house, your furniture, your booksand even your gurus—the Catholic guru, or the Protestant guru, or the Indianguru—with you. So what is it that human beings are so dreadfully frightened of?They are frightened of something ending, of ending psychologically, inwardly.And knowing it is going to end we want comfort, so we say there must be acontinuity. The ancient Hindus said there is a continuity, which is calledreincarnation. They said you will be reborn next life according to what you havedone in this life. If you have behaved properly, decently, morally, in the nextlife you are going to be better, and through a series of incarnations, anddepending on your behavior, you will ultimately come to the highest principle.That is a very comforting theory, and millions believe in that. The Buddhistattitude is that life is a constant flux, a constant movement and when thatmanifests, an enclosure takes place which becomes the “you,” the “me,” whichthrough time, through constant movement, undergoes change. And of course theChristians have their own belief in the resurrection; they believe that theirown deity woke up from death physically.We are saying something entirely different. Please listen because you will see,if you really understand this thing, that there is a timeless movement, atimeless state. First, we said, the world is you, and you are the world. Allhuman beings, radically, basically, are afraid, anxious, in sorrow, confused,unhappy, with occasional joy; psychologically it is a constant movement,wherever human beings are it is the same stream. It is the same stream;therefore, you are the world and the world is you. That is a fact. You may havedifferent temperament, different gifts, capacities, idiosyncrasies, but thoseare the responses of the culture in which you have lived. But the basic streamis the same.Therefore, there is no individuality. Individuality implies a wholeness, anindivisible entity, and you are not that indivisible entity. You are divided,broken up; therefore, you are not actually an individual, indivisible. Youbecome totally individual in the complete sense of that word when you are whole,in which there is no fragmentary action. The word whole means healthy, sane,holy. You are the world and the world is you, and you are caught in thatconstant stream. But sorrow can be ended, fear can be ended—not tomorrow,actually now; then you are out of that stream—not you, there is a manifestation,which is out of that stream or freed from that stream, because that stream istime.That stream is time. So you have to find out whether time has a stop. Time has astop when there is no longer the movement of that stream. That stream is fear,that stream is conflict, that stream is sorrow, and all the confusion man hasbuilt through thought. So that is the stream of time. When there is an ending tothat stream, time has stopped; therefore, there is a totally differentdimension.So the thing that we are afraid of losing when death takes place is thestructure that thought has built as “me,” the form, the name, and the attachmentto the form and to that name, which are pain, pleasure, anxiety. All that is the“me,” the “you.” You can say there is a higher me, but that is still the productof thought. So that movement in which human beings are caught is the movement oftime, driven by thought. The greater the volume of that stream the greater isthe volume of thought. And when that stream, which is our consciousness with allits content, comes to an end, then time has a stop and, therefore, there is atotally different dimension. And when you understand this, not verbally, butdeeply, and live it daily—and it can be done—then you will see that death has atotally different significance.Ojai, April 17. 1976"},{"pageContent":"6 One has been talking for the last fifty years and more, seeing a lot of people,talking over not only their personal problems, but the global problems of humanbeings, the vast confusion, the misery, the extraordinary lack of clarity. Andthrough all these days and years it becomes more and more clear that unlesshuman beings radically transform themselves, we may destroy not only ourselvesbut the earth. So it seems to us that there must be a group of people who areutterly serious, who are concerned, not superficially, not adjusting themselvesto environment and circumstances, but deeply, and who will live a life that iswhole, complete, noble, full of intensity and clarity. Otherwise we waste theshort years we have.So we have talked about various things, like the utter lack of relationshipbetween human beings; we have talked about the process of thought as a materialmovement in time and said that thought is totally inadequate to solve our humanproblems because thought has created them. Thought cannot solve them becausethought is a fragment, a material process and a movement of measure. We alsotalked about fear and the ending of it, about understanding the whole complexproblem of pleasure and of the ending of sorrow, and we talked about love anddeath.As we are concerned with the very deep problem of existence, we must not putaside the whole question of religion, meditation, and whether there is anythingsacred, holy.To hear correctly is an art. To see things as they are is also an art. And tolearn, not from others, the whole content of one’s human consciousness, which isthe result of millennia of human endeavor, human sorrow, human agony, anxiety.It is all there in us. In learning to look at, to listen to all the content ofthat consciousness, in the observation of that consciousness, is action.We are going to discuss religion together, because religion is the creativefactor of a new culture. If there is no religion then the culture dies,civilization goes to pieces. Considering what the world is like, with all itsbrutality, violence, wars, divisions, class hatreds, and so on, which allindicate degeneration of the human mind, it behooves us to discover forourselves what religion is. Is it a gathering of beliefs? Is it performingrituals, repeating endless words which have really no meaning at all? Is itgoing on Sunday morning to a church, or to a temple, or to a mosque, andrepeating some chant, some words. If one asks oneself seriously, what is thenecessity of any belief, of any conclusion? Beliefs, conclusions, divide people.In this little village there are five or six divisions of Christianity. Andthroughout the world there is much division brought about by so-calledreligions—the Hindu, the Buddhist, the Muslim, and the Christian, and theirinnumerable sects. So what is the importance of any belief at all? Or doesbelief prevent the understanding of what truth is?Is religion divorced from daily life, or is religion a movement that bringsorder in our life? If religion is divorced from our daily life it can onlycreate further confusion, further conflict.To find out the meaning of religion, one must have order in one’s life. Our lifeis confused, contradictory, disorderly, fragmented, broken up; how can such alife have order? Order is not the acceptance of a blueprint. Order comes onlywhen one realizes, is aware fully, without any choice, of one’s own confusion,one’s own daily disordered life. From awareness without any choice of disordercomes order; that is, from the understanding, from the observation of our dailylife, which is disorderly. Such observation is not based on condemnation,rationalization, judgment. From that choiceless awareness comes order and thisorder is a living thing; therefore, it is constantly moving. Although to themodern generation, morality means nothing, morality in essence is order. Andwithout order how can there be clarity?Part of this touches the question of meditation; without order in one’s life,without being totally moral in one’s daily activity, how can you even think ofmeditating? You may sit cross-legged for the rest of your life, for the next tenincarnations or a million incarnations, breathe in a certain way that you havelearned in India, but you will never come upon that which is truth because yourlife is disorderly. Therefore, you must bring order into that life before youeven think of meditating; if you “meditate” without having order, it is amarvelous escape and, therefore, without any significance, without any meaning.Please do realize this. Meditation is the most marvelous thing, but not yourkind of meditation. There must be order in our relationship, and that can onlyexist when there is no fear. Order is not put together by thought. If it is puttogether by thought then it will create further disorder.To find, or come upon, that which is most sacred, most holy, there must be alife based solidly on order. And the importance of all meditations is to comeupon that silence. Even biologically, physiologically, to see anything clearly,to look at the trees, the light on the leaves, the green grass, and the hillsand to see them clearly your mind must be quiet, mustn’t it. It is so simple, wemake it so complex. To see anything clearly, to observe clearly, you must have aquiet mind, mustn’t you? If you are chattering, chattering, you won’t see thetree, you won’t see the depth of the shadow, the beauty of a trunk or a limb.You can only see it when your mind is quiet.See the fact of it, the reason of it, the logic of it, that you can seesomething clearly only when your mind is silent. You cannot hear what somebodyelse is saying if you are talking to yourself all the time. So if you want tohear somebody clearly you must be quiet. So silence is absolutely necessary toperceive outwardly and inwardly. The outward and the inward are the samemovement, they are not different. It is one unitary movement, but we havedivided it as the inner and the outer. By observing the outer clearly, you thendiscover the inner, and then see that it is one movement. To see this clearlyyou must look, observe silently.We are investigating together the meaning and the depth of that thing calledreligion, to find out if there is anything incorruptible, untouched by thought,which is not an illusion, which is not the projection of one’s own desire, or anexperience, but something that has never been touched by thought, somethingtotally original. And to come upon that we said there must be order in dailylife, which is the essence of virtue.There are different kinds of silence, aren’t there? There is the silence betweentwo noises—is that silence? There is silence between two thoughts—is thatsilence? There is so-called peace between two wars—is that peace? So what issilence? Is it put together by thought? Is it contrived? Is it something that ismanufactured because you understand that if you want to see “heaven” you must besilent? Then you say, “How am I to be silent? Teach me how to be silent.” Out ofthe desire to find out what silence is, people begin to invent systems, methods,ways to come upon that.Now if once you understand this you will never touch any system; because what isimplied in a system and a practice? Repetition, practice, practice, practice,control, make an effort, which is, become mechanical. As we have said, part ofour brain has become mechanical. We said thought in its essence is mechanical,because thought is the repetition, or the reaction, of memory. And when youalready live a life that is mechanical and try to go beyond that mechanical lifeby introducing another mechanical process, which is systems, methods, practices,you are still mechanical. So when once you see the truth of this, the logic, thereason of this, you will never touch systems, methods, practices. Anything thatis contrived, put together by thought—however beautiful, however logical,however ancient, traditional—makes the mind more mechanical and eventually dull.The very seeing of the truth of that ends the demand for systems, methods.If silence is not put together by thought, then what is it? To see clearly youmust be silent, to hear clearly the mind must not be chattering. If you see thetruth of it, then it happens. You do not have to make an effort to be silent.So what is that which is silent? We will look at it by examining awareness. Whatis awareness, to be aware? When you are sitting there you are aware of thetrees, the shadows, the light on the leaves, the movement of the leaves. [Thetalk is taking place in the open in an oak grove.] If you are looking at thetree you are aware of it. Can you look at it without verbalization? Just lookwithout naming it, without giving it a quality, or description, just observe.We never just observe: we look and say, “How beautiful,” “How ugly,” “Howuseful,” depending on our conditioning. So we never observe things as they ate.Now can you observe, see the beauty of this whole land, all the hills, theirquietness, their shadows, just observe without any reaction of thought, withoutany reaction of like and dislike? Just to observe, that is awareness. Be awareof the universe around you, then be aware of the universe inside. The universeinside is much more complex. The universe inside is our whole consciousness. Andthe consciousness is its content. The universe inside is much more complex, muchmore subtle, and if one has the energy, the capacity, the intensity, and theclarity, to go into it, there is a tremendous depth in that. So, be aware firstof the outer, look at it, and be aware of all your reactions to it, and then gobeyond your reactions and observe. Now in the same way go into the universe ofyourself, which is your consciousness, with all its content, with itsexperiences, with its knowledge, with its likes, with its fears, anxieties,sorrow, pain. Be conscious of that enormous content that man has added to forthousands of years, be aware of that.Can one be aware totally? Or must one take one segment after another, one layerafter another, one fragment after another? The content of consciousness makes upconsciousness; if there is no content there is no consciousness, as we know it.Will you understand the content of consciousness bit by bit? Or is there anunderstanding of it totally? The content of your consciousness is yourconditioning—as a Christian, as a socialist, by the climate, by the food, by allthe things that man has done to himself and to others, his identifications, hisbeliefs. All that is consciousness. To understand that consciousness, will youexamine it portion by portion? Or is there a way of looking at it wholly, sothat you don’t have to take time?There is a way of looking at it wholly, not fragment by fragment. And that isonly possible if you understand awareness. So there is awareness of the worldoutside you, watching your reactions to the world outside you, and observingwithout reactions the world outside you. And move from the outer to the innerwith all the content, which is your consciousness, to observe it. First you willreact to it, naturally: “I don’t like,” “I like,” “How beautiful this is,” “Howpleasurable that was,” “I wish I could keep a little bit of this,” and so on andso on and so on. Watch that reaction and then go beyond it. If you go beyond itthen, you see the whole content instantly.This is part of meditation: to see the outer actually as it is, not what youwish it to be, the wars, the antagonisms, the hatreds, the innumerable insultsand hurts that human beings receive, the sorrow, the pain, the anxiety, theloneliness, lack of love, to observe all that. Then what takes place? Then youwill see that energy is being gathered, because there is order and, therefore,there is no wastage of energy. When there is mathematical order in your dailylife, there is no wastage of energy. It is only when there is no order thatthere is wastage of energy. When there is order, there is the accumulation ofenergy. And with that energy observe the world and yourself, and realize theworld out there and here are the same movement. There is the accumulation ofenergy when there is an observation without the observer. The observer is thepast, the past being all your prejudices, your opinions, your conclusions, yourtraditional responses. The observer is the past and the observer meets thepresent, the what is, and tries to translate it according to his pastconclusions. Right? That gives to the past further movement in time as thefuture. You are the result of the past. That is a fact. Part of your brain isthe result of a series of adventures, happenings, incidents, experiences, asknowledge, and knowledge is always the past. That movement of the past meets thepresent and translates the present, or modifies the present according to thepast and so gives a further movement into the future. The past meeting thepresent is a movement; the present is also a movement; if the past meeting thepresent ends there, which means no movement, then time has a stop.So meditation then is bringing about order in life, and thereby gathering greatenergy, and ending conflict between the observer and the observed, which addsfurther energy. When there is a division between the observer and the observedthere must be conflict. When you are angry, at the moment of anger, at thesecond of anger, there is no division; but a second later a division takesplace: “I must not be angry,” or, “Why shouldn’t I be angry?” Where there is adivision, there must be conflict. Conflict with all its violence is a wastage ofenergy. The gathering of total energy is the beginning of silence.We live confused lives, our consciousness is in turmoil, constantly in battle,constantly choosing, denying, asserting, dominating, being attached. It is inconstant struggle, boiling all the time; and that boiling is a wastage ofenergy. For that turmoil to come to an end is part of meditation. Not bycontrol. The moment you control, who is the controller? Please, go into thisyourself. The controller is part of thought. When the controller tries tocontrol thought that is a wastage of energy. But if you see the truth, that thecontroller is the controlled, then the conflict comes to an end. That means youhave further energy, and this energy is necessary, this complete energy, whichis not put together by friction. Friction has its own energy, but this energythat we are talking about is not put together by thought and, therefore, it isnot the result of friction. This energy is necessary to come upon that which issacred, which is the religious mind.Meditation then is the emptying of the content of consciousness—which means thefears, the anxieties, the conflicts in relationship—the ending of sorrow and,therefore, compassion. The ending of the content of consciousness is completesilence. Then that silence is full of energy. It is not vacant silence. It isnot a silence that wants something more.So meditation is not the repetition of mantras, not merely sitting downbreathing carefully. Meditation must be totally uninvited, not contrived, notput together. Which means there is no measurement. If one has gone that far—no,it is not far or near—if one has done this, then there is that emptiness.Now wait a minute. Scientists say in this emptiness there is energy. We aresaying that when there is this meditative process, movement, there is a totallydifferent kind of consciousness of a dimension in which there is all this energywhich has been gathered through meditation, order in life. You have totalenergy—there is total energy. And in that emptiness there is not a thing. Thereis nothing. Nothing means not a thing. Thing means thought. Thought is amaterial process. So in that emptiness thought does not exist at all. And,therefore, there is no experiencer who is experiencing this total nothingness.What is beauty? That is also part of our life. Is it the shadow? The line of anarchitectural building? The painting? The marvelous cultures that exist in theworld? The mountains? The running waters? The beautiful face? What is beauty?Does not beauty exist when there is not a center of conflict? When you say, “Howbeautiful it is,” what is the feeling behind that? What is the nature, thequality of emotion, the surging of something? Is that beauty? Or is beauty thetotal absence of the observer? When there is only complete observation, in whichthere is no choice, no division, there must be this sense of beauty. That may bethat which is sacred. Not the beauty of form of a woman or a man. There is thebeauty of woman and man, the beauty of a tree, the beauty of a line, of a sheetof water, the running sea, but to find out, or come upon that sense of totalabsence of anything that is contradictory, something that is whole, complete,sane, rational. Such a mind is a beautiful mind, which is the religious mind.Because there you have total energy embodied.So there is such a thing as something sacred that is not touched by thought,that is not touched or made corrupt by human beings, with their desires andfrights and quarrels and mischief. And to come upon that is not only part ofmeditation, but the ending of sorrow, which is the beginning of wisdom. Sowisdom is not learning from books or going to a school. When there is an endingof sorrow in yourself as a human being, then out of that comes wisdom.And when a human being transforms himself, when you transform yourselfradically, you are affecting the whole consciousness of mankind. You aremankind, you are the movement of mankind. This is a fact, this is actual. If youchange, you affect the world. So it is your tremendous responsibility. We mustbe very skeptical of all psychological experiences, subjective experiences,because they are most destructive.So meditation implies a life of great order and, therefore, great virtue,morality. And it implies the understanding and the depth of beauty. And itimplies the emptying of that consciousness which is you, with all yourattachments, fears, hopes, despairs, the emptying of all that by observing.Then you have energy which alone can discover that which is eternal, which hasno beginning and no ending.Ojai, April 18, 1976"},{"pageContent":"THE WHOLENESS OF LIFE [index_split_001.html#filepos6723] One wonders, observing what is going on in the world, why there is so muchdisorder, why man is destroying man. Why is there such enormous expenditure onarmaments? Why have people divided themselves into tribal romanticnationalities? Why have the organized religions, the accepted religions,throughout the world, divided themselves? Why is there such division in theworld? We are inclined to think that an outside agency has created all thismess, that “God,” or some other supreme entity, having created man, has let himloose on the earth. What mankind has done is quite incredible and shocking, notonly toward other human beings, but also in himself. Why in the world are thereare so many neurotic people? Why is there this constant battle between man andwoman? Why is there this inward disorder, which naturally must express itself inoutward disorder?Our lives have produced the society in which we live. Society is not created bysome extraordinary events but by the extraordinary lives we lead, not only we,but also past generations. Could we go together into it, think it out together,not only think it out but also go beyond the realm of thought? We have pointedout over and over again that thought is born of memory, memory is the result ofknowledge and experience. And thought, therefore, is always limited, forknowledge is everlastingly limited because there can be no complete knowledgeabout anything. And thought born out of that must also be very, very limited.And the world in which we live, our daily life, our careers, our anxieties,fears, and sorrows, are the result of our thinking, are the product of our dailyactivity.Could we together look at life as a whole, our education, our occupations, ourhobbies, work, and all the travail that exists inwardly, the psychologicalconflicts, the anxieties, the fears, the pleasures, the sorrows? Could we takeall that as a whole and not let thought occupy itself with one particular part,with one particular pattern, or cling to one particular experience, looking atlife from only that point of view? Why do we live the way we are living? Why isthere so much disorder in the world and in ourselves? Is the world disorderdifferent from our disorder?Why is there disorder outwardly and disorder inwardly? Are they two separatedisorders? Or are they one unitary process? The disorder out there is notdifferent from the disorder in me, but rather this disorder is a movement whichgoes outward and comes inward. It is like a tide going back and forth endlessly.Can we begin to bring about order in our life? Because without order there is nofreedom. Complete order, not occasionally or once a week, but in our daily life,not only brings freedom; there is then in that order love. A disordered,confused, mind that is in conflict cannot have or be aware of what love is.Can there be absolute order? We are using the word absolute in its right sense,complete, total, not an order that is intellectually brought about, an orderthat is based on values, not order that is the outcome of environmentalpressures, or adaptation to a certain norm, a certain pattern. We are talkingabout absolute total order in which there is no division as disorder at all. Weare asking whether there is an order in which there can never be disorder.Why does our mind, which includes the brain, our emotional responses, sensoryresponses, and so on, accept and live in disorder? If you observe your own mind,that is, your own life, which is based on your mind, your thoughts, youremotions, your experiences, your memories, regrets, apprehensions, why does thatmind, which has all this in its consciousness, accept disorder? Not only theneurotic disorder, the acceptance of disorder and living with disorder, gettingused to disorder, but why does the mind have this sense of division, this senseof order and disorder, this constant adjustment? Is this inevitable? Is this ournatural state? If it is natural then one must live with this conflict, in thisdisorder, from the moment you are born until you die. And if it is unnatural,which obviously it is, what is the cause of it? What is the basis of it, what isthe root of all this? Does the basis depend on our particular attitudes, on ourparticular desires?One wants to find out what is the basis of this disorder, the root of it. Tofind out, how do we approach it? How do we approach the problem of disorder inorder to resolve it totally? What is your approach? Are you approaching to findorder out of disorder and, therefore, your approach is already directed? SupposeI am in disorder and I have the desire to bring about order. That very desiredictates what the order must be, whereas if I approach the problem of disorderas though I want to find the root of it, then my direction is not diverted,wasted in various intellectual, verbal, and emotional directions, but my wholeattention is directed to the cause of it. So how do you, as a human being,living in this world, both outwardly and inwardly in disorder, approach this? Wemust be very clear what our approach is.If it is clear then let us find out together what is the root of disorder. Is itself-contradiction? Is it desire that has created this division in us? Whereverthere is division there must be conflict, and conflict means disorder. Conflictis disorder, whether it is minor, or conflict that brings about a great crisis.So is our conflict self-contradiction, saying one thing, doing another, havingideals and always trying to accommodate ourselves to those ideals? Is it ourdesire to become something? Or is this conflict created by thought? Becausethought in itself, as we said, is limited and, therefore, it divides as theouter and the inner, the “you” and the “me.” Thought struggles to becomesomething which it is not. Are these constant divisions, becoming,contradicting, conforming, comparing, imitating psychologically, the variousexpressions of a central cause?So what is the central cause, the root of all this? You are exercising yourmind; therefore, you are aware of how you approach the problem, you are aware ofyour own contradictions, your own conflicts, your own divisions, your ownapprehensions. Is one aware of all that? Or is one aware only of a fragment ofit, a fragment that demands an immediate response? If I am concerned about mylivelihood, I am not concerned about anything else because that is an immediatedemand. I need money, food; I have children, responsibility; therefore, myapproach to this whole problem will be directed by my desire to have a job. Orif I have been thinking along a certain pattern, along a certain direction, andI am unaware that I am caught in that pattern, then when I approach thisquestion I am always approaching it according to the pattern that my mind hasestablished. Or if I am emotional, romantic, then my approach will be sloppy,not precise, not exact.So one must be very clear for oneself how one approaches this problem, becauseif we approach it with any pattern at all we shall not be able to solve it.Therefore, is our mind free from patterns? From ideals? From a direction? Areyou aware of the confusion of the world, which is becoming worse every day? Andof the confusion in us which we have inherited, to which we have added? Of thesociety in which we live, which is so utterly confused, where there is suchgreat injustice: millions starving and the affluent society; tyranny anddemocratic freedom to think what you like, to express what you like?Our mind and our consciousness is the consciousness and the mind of the world.Wherever you go man is suffering, anxious, uncertain, lonely, desperate in hisloneliness, burdened with sorrow, insecure. Psychologically, you are thehumanity, you are not separate from the rest of mankind. The idea that you arean individual with a mind that is specially yours is an absurdity because thisbrain has evolved through time. It is the brain of mankind, and that brain ispart of mankind, genetically, and so on, and so on. So you are the world and theworld is you. It is not an idea or a concept, a Utopian nonsense; it is a fact.And that mind is utterly confused. And we are trying to discover for ourselvesthe root of it.What is the cause of these divisions between man and woman, between nation andnation, between one group and another group, these divisions of belief, ideals,concepts, historical conclusions, and materialistic attitudes? Division mustinevitably create conflict. That is a fact. Through division we think that therecan be security; where there is division as British, French, German, each groupholding together as an idea, as a concept, under a flag, they think there issecurity. And this isolation must inevitably create division. So do weunderstand very deeply the truth that as long as there is division there must beconflict? Obviously there is no security in this isolation, this seclusion. Youcan build a wall around yourself as a nation but that wall is going to be brokendown.So what is the cause, the root, of this division? Each human being in the worldthinks, lives according to the pattern, that he is separate from another, withhis problems, his anxieties, his neurosis, his particular way of thinking. Thecenter of this is the idea that I am separate from you. Now, is that a fact? Isit a fact that we are separate individuals, totally different from another? Youmay be tall, you may be short, have black hair, white hair, but inwardly are wedifferent? Inwardly we all go through the same, or similar, things. So there isno division psychologically. And as long as we accept that idea that we areseparate you must have conflict and, therefore, division and confusion.You hear a statement like this, that as long as you think you are separate fromanother human being psychologically, there must be conflict and disorder. Thatis a fact. When you hear that, do you make an abstraction of it as an idea andthen see how that idea can be carried out? Or it is a fact? If it is a fact,then you can do something about it. But if you are merely making an abstractionof that fact into an idea then we are getting lost, because you have your ideaand I have my idea. But it is a common fact upon which we stand as human beings,that as long as there is division inside me and you, there must be conflict anddisorder and confusion. But our minds are so conditioned; for thousands of yearswe have been conditioned by what other people have said to think that we areseparate. Religions have said that we are separate, that each individual mustsave himself; that whole pattern is repeated over and over and over again. Beingso conditioned it is very difficult to accept something which perhaps is true. Iam using the word perhaps because I am not being dogmatic; but it is a fact.Going into it analytically with you, if you are willing, with argument,intellectually, reasoning, at the end of it, we come to the same fact.If we want to understand the nature of confusion and the ending ofconfusion—completely, not relatively—are we aware of this fact? If we are aware,then the question arises: What shall I do? I know I am divided, now how am I toput away this division?Is the fact of this division different from the observer who is observing thefact? I will explain a little. I observe greed. I am greedy. Is that greed whichI observe different from me, from the observer who says, “I am greedy”? Or greedis the observer? Right? So there is no division between the observer who says,“I am greedy” and who acts upon greed, saying, “I must not be greedy. I mustcontrol it. I must suppress it. I must go beyond it.” So there is a division,and that division is conflict and, therefore disorder. But the fact is, that theobserver who says “I am greedy,’ that observer is greed himself. Have you gonethat far? If you have gone that far, then I am asking: Is this confusion, thisdivision, different from the observer who is me observing it? Or is thisconfusion, this division, me? My whole being is that, right? I wonder if youcome to that point, otherwise you can’t go much further. Please come! This isreally important if you can really understand this once and for all as a fact.If you understand it, it will make life totally different, because in that thereis no conflict. I will point it out.Suppose I am attached to a person. In that attachment and in the consequences ofthat attachment are innumerable pains, jealousy, anxiety, dependency, the wholeconsequence of attachment. In that attachment to the person there is divisionimmediately. Now is that attachment, the feeling of dependence, clinging,holding on to somebody, different from me? Or I am that? I am attachment. If onerealizes that, conflict ends. It is so. Not that I must get rid of it, not thatI must be independent, detached; detachment is attachment; if I try to becomedetached I am attached to that detachment.So now am I very clear that there is no division: When I say I am attached, I amattachment, I am the state of attachment. Therefore, I have removed completelyall conflict, haven’t I? Do you realize that? I am that.So I, me, is confusion. It is not that I realize I am confusion, or that I havebeen told that I am confusion, but the fact is that I, as a human being, am in astate of confusion. Any action I do will bring more confusion. So I am in astate of total confusion. And all the struggle to overcome it, suppress it, tobe detached, all that is gone, all movement of escape has completely come to anend. If it has not, don’t move from there. Be free first of all escapes, of allverbal, symbolic escapes, and remain totally with the fact that you are, as ahuman being, in a state of confusion. Then what has taken place?We are two friends talking this over, this is not therapy or any of thatnonsense, or psychological analysis. We are two people talking this overtogether, saying how we have come to that point, logically, rationally,unemotionally, and, therefore, sanely. Because to be sane is the most difficultthing. So we have come to that point: that is, I am that. What has taken placein the mind?Before, I wasted energy in suppressing, trying to find how not to be confused,going to some guru or someone else. All that I have done is a wastage of energy.Now when there is the realization that I am confused, what has happened? Comewith me! My mind then is completely attentive to confusion. My mind is in astate of complete attention with regard to confusion. Right? Therefore, whattakes place? When there is complete attention, there is no confusion. It is onlywhen there is no attention that confusion arises. Confusion arises when there isdivision, which is inattention.Where there is total attention there is no dissipation of energy. When I amsaying, “How am I to get this total attention?” that is a wastage of energy.When you see that where there is confusion it is brought about by inattention,then that very inattention is attention.Now with that attention we are going to examine fear, pleasure, suffering. It isimportant to be free of fear. The mind has never been free of fear. You maycover it, you may suppress it, you may be unaware of it, you may be so enchantedby the world outside that you are never aware of your own deep-rooted fears.Where there is fear there is no freedom, there is no love, there is discontent.To see this, you must have the capacity to run—not physically but inwardly run,jump—not go step by step like a snail.One sees what fear does in our life. Fear brings darkness to the mind. We arenot talking of a particular neurotic fear, but about fear itself. When weunderstand the root of fear, fear about something particular disappears. If I amafraid of the dark, that is my particular fear and I want that particular fearto be resolved; I am not concerned with the whole field of fear. But if Iunderstand the whole field of fear, the other thing doesn’t exist. We areconcerned with the whole field of fear. Can that fear be dissolved completely,so that the physical fear and the complex fears of the psyche, the inward fears,dissolver? The physical fears one can deal with fairly simply, but if you areattached to physical fears and are concerned only with resolving the physicalfears then you are attached to that which will then create division and,therefore, conflict. If we understand first the psychological fears, then youcan deal with the physical fears, not the other way round. First deal with thewider fear, the depth and the nature and the darkness of fear, then you willyourself resolve the particular physical fears. Don’t start the other way, withthe physical fear, which is what we all want to do.The psychological fears are far more important; they make us such ugly humanbeings. When there is fear, we become violent, we want to destroy in the name ofGod, in the name of religion, in the name of social revolution, and so on, andso on. Now, can we as human beings, who have lived with this fear forimmeasurable time, be free of it? We have asked that question; now how do youapproach the problem of fear? Do you approach it with the desire to resolve it?If you do, you are again separating yourself from the fact of fear. So are youapproaching it as an observer who is afraid and wants to resolve it, or do yourealize that you are fear?Have you given your total attention to this fact? That you, as a human being,who is the rest of humanity, are frightened, live in fear, consciously orunconsciously, with superficial fears or deep hidden fears? The hidden fearbecomes completely open when you are attentive.You are investigating, you are looking at yourself, not agreeing with thespeaker, the speaker is not important. And I mean it, he is not important. Whatis important is that you walk away without a single shadow of fear. So when youbecome aware of fear, do you escape from it? Do you try to find an answer forit? Do you try to overcome it? If you do, you are dissipating energy; therefore,you are dividing and, therefore, there is conflict about fear and how to be freeof it. All that arises. But if you realize that fear is you, there is nomovement to be made. There is no movement to be made, you are that and,therefore, all your attention is directed, is that; in that attention fear isheld.It is up to you. You see, as long as we try to overcome, the very overcoming hasto be overcome. But if you say, “Yes, it is a fact and I won’t move from that,”then the thing dissolves—completely, not relatively, not gone one day and thenthe next day is full of fears. It is gone when you have given complete attentionto it.It is similar with regard to pleasure. Be careful now! We have to be verycareful here.I don’t know if you have noticed that right from the earliest time of man, onething that has driven him everlastingly forward is pleasure, the pursuit ofpleasure and the avoidance of sorrow. You can see it in the pictures, thepaintings, the ancient writings, the symbols. Everything says, Pursue this,avoid that. Thought can divide life into fear, pleasure, sorrow, job; but theyare all one, aren’t they? See what we have done: our mind has been conditioned,accepting, living in this norm of constant pursuit of pleasure. God, if you havethat image, is the essence of pleasure. You name it differently but your urge isto attain that ultimate sublime pleasure so that you will never be disturbed,you will never be in conflict, and so on, and so on, and so on. And we mustunderstand it, not suppress it, not run away from it.Why has pleasure, like sorrow, like fear, become so all important in life? Doyou understand the word sorrow, the suffering of man, the suffering ofcenturies, war after war, destroying human beings, destroying nature, destroyinganimals, whales, everything. Man not only suffers but causes suffering. That ispart of us, part of our consciousness. And we try to avoid that because we havenot solved it. We think the pursuit of pleasure is the main thing, that in thatat least we can have something accurate, something real that will go on. So thatbecomes dominant, and fear, sorrow, anxiety, are all in the background—not onlysexual pleasures, but the remembrances, the pictures, and all the rest that goeson in the mind. If you watch it, you see what is happening, that your own mindsbecome full of that. Not the actual act but the whole build-up, and thatbuilding-up is called love. So pleasure, love, suffering, fear are allentangled, all interrelated.So will you take tear, pleasure, sorrow, separately, one by one? Or will youhave the capacity to deal with the whole of it? Our minds are being broken up,so we take one by one, hoping to resolve one by one and come to the end of thebreaking up, the fragments. Now how will you deal with the whole of it? Dealwith your disorder, pleasure, fear, sorrow as a total movement of life? Not assomething separate, but as a whole. Can you do it? That is, can you look atyourself as though it were in a mirror, psychologically, as a whole being? Orcan you only look at a part?How do you look at yourself Can you take your job, your wife and children, yourreligion, your particular way of thinking, your experiences, your ideas, yourintentions, your ambitions, as one unitary movement? That is the only way tosolve the whole thing, not through fragments.Now how will a mind, the brain, the emotions, that have been broken up forgenerations upon generations, approach or realize the totality? Will youapproach the whole of life fragmentarily, business first, money first, housefirst, wife, children, sex, bit by bit? Or can your mind see the whole ofexistence? Is it capable of that? Or are you striving to see the whole of it? Ifyou are striving to see the whole of it, it is finished, you will never have it,because then you create a division, conflict, confusion. To see that life is onemovement, you need really to learn. Learn—not from me! Learn from yourself byobserving. Learn to observe the division and see the futility of approachingthat; see the obvious fact that you can’t through one fragment approach thewhole universe. You must have a mind that is capable of receiving the wholeuniverse, and that is possible only when the mind is clear of confusion, fear.Then there is no shadow of division, as the “me” and “you,” my country, yourcountry, my dogma, and so on. That means, when there is complete freedom thenthere is the perception of the whole. And from that comprehension, from thatintelligence, one can act in the world, to get a job, to get no job, to doanything. But now we approach it as parts and we are creating havoc in theworld.[images/00003.jpg]Why does the mind live in time? It has evolved in time. The present mind that wehave has evolved through thousands of years. And that is normal and healthy,obviously. But we are asking why time has become so important psychologically,inwardly. Please ask yourself. Is it because we are always avoiding what is inorder to become something else, moving from this to that? Psychologically I amthis, but I should not be this but that. Psychologically I am unhappy, but Imust be happy. The “must” or “will” or “shall be” is the movement of time. Sothe mind is caught in time because it is always moving away from this, from whatis. It will change in time: “I will be good, give me time.” That is likedeveloping a muscle. Your muscle may not be sufficiently strong but if you keepon doing something to strengthen it, it will become strong. With the samementality we say, “I am this, I will be that, so give me time.” But will what isbe changed through time? When I have great anxiety, can that anxiety be changedthrough time? That is, will I become, or be in, a state where I have no anxiety?See what I have done? I have anxiety; I have projected a state of not beinganxious; and to arrive at that state I must have time. But I never ask if thisanxiety I have can be changed immediately without allowing time. See whathappens: I am anxious; I hope to be not anxious; there is a time interval, alag, and in that lag of time all other activities are going on, other pressures,negligence; so anxiety is never solved. I think I will come to a state when Ihave no anxiety, so I am struggling, struggling. It is like a man who isviolent. He has invented nonviolence, but in that time interval he is violent,so he never reaches nonviolence.So the question is then: Can what is be transformed immediately, which meansnever allowing time to interfere? Listen to this, you will find out, it isreally simple. If we apply our mind we can solve anything. They have been to themoon, built marvelous submarines, done incredible things. Here, psychologically,we are so reluctant, so incapable, or have made ourselves incapable. If you donot allow time, or never think in terms of time, then the fact is not. Becausewe allow time the fact becomes important. If there is no time it is resolved.Suppose I died this second, there is no problem. When I allow time, I am afraidof death. If I live completely without psychological time, it is anextraordinary thing. Time means accumulation. Time means remembrance. Time meansaccumulating knowledge about oneself. But when there is no time at all,psychologically, there is nothing.Because we have allowed time as a factor to intervene between living and dying,fear arises. The nature of dying can be found in the living. That is, death isthe ending, the ending of my possessions, my wife, my children, my house, mybank account. In that ending there is no argument. I don’t say to death, “Pleasehold on a minute.” So where there is ending, there is a beginning. I will gointo it.When there is an ending to attachment—completely, not just to persons and ideasbut the whole process of attachment, with all the consequences of that—there isa totally different state of mind. Isn’t there? I have been attached to myfurniture and that attachment has been a burden. With the ending of that burdenthere is freedom. So ending is more important than beginning. So can I, living,end? End my anxiety, end my feats. End, not the bank account, I am not talkingof that, but ending psychologically. Ending my uncertainty. When I am confused,to end it, not say, “I must find out why I am confused, what is the cause ofconfusion, and I must be free from confusion.” All that is time. That isnegligence, whereas diligence is to be aware of the whole movement of time andto end anxiety immediately. Therefore, there is no accumulation psychologicallyas knowledge.Now death is ending. Ending of everything. Death is an ending and I am living.We are living, active. Can we psychologically end everything? Can you end yourattachment instantly, immediately—your anger, your violence, your greed, yourthis and that, end while living? Then living is dying. Not living and ultimatelydying. Living means the dying, otherwise you are not alive. And most of us arefrightened of dying because we have never been able to live properly, we havenever lived. We have lived in conflict, in struggle, in pain, in anxiety, and wecall that living. Living is not all that. If all that can be ended, then thereis living. So you are then living and dying. They go together, like a flowerwith perfume; the perfume is not apart from the flower, it is there.This is the actual ending of senility, if you go into it very deeply, so themind never gets old like a machine that is always wearing itself out because offriction. But it is not your mind, it is the human mind. The mind is the resultof a million years, it is the mind of the Indian, of the Chinese, the Russians,all other human beings, because they go through similar pain, anxiety, sorrow,pleasures, occasional joys and occasional love. So our brain, our mind, is themind of humanity. If you can understand that one real fact then we will livewithout any division, which is causing such disaster in the world.Because their minds are everlastingly chattering, everlastingly moving from onething to another, driven by desire, driven by seeking reward and avoiding pain,human beings have always sought some kind of quietness, some kind of peace inwhich at least for ten minutes it can be quiet. Man has sought this. Go to thechurch, sit there quietly. Go to a marvelous cathedral, when there is no circusgoing on, and be quiet. And it is a strange fact that in all these churchesthere is never a moment of quietness, except when it is empty. Because if youare quiet, you might inquire. If you are quiet, you might begin to doubt. But ifyou are occupied all the time, you never have time to look around, to question,to doubt, to ask. That may be one of the great tricks of the human mind.What is meditation and why should one meditate? Is it natural? Like breathing,like seeing, like hearing, is it natural? And why have we made it so unnatural?Taking postures, following systems of Buddhist meditation, Tibetan meditation,Christian meditation, Tantric meditations, and the meditations set by yourfavorite guru. Aren’t all those really abnormal? Why should I take a certainposition to meditate? Why should I practice, practice, practice? To arrivewhere? Can I follow a system—twenty minutes in the morning, twenty minutes inthe evening—to have a quiet mind? Having achieved a little quiet mind I can gooff and do other mischief all day long.Is there a way of meditating that is none of these things? People say meditationis to quiet the mind, to have a mind that is capable of observation, to have amind that is completely centered, completely concentrated, so that there is nothought except one thought, one picture, one image, one center upon which youare looking. Right? I don’t know if you have gone through all this? The speakerhas played with them for half an hour for each of these meditations, for tenminutes, five minutes, and they meant nothing.You have to go into the question of who is the controller and who is thecontrolled. Our whole life, if you observe, is this: controlling and notcontrolling: I must control my emotions; I must control my thinking; I can onlycontrol my thinking by constant practice; and to practice I must have a system.A system implies a mechanical process, making the mind more and more mechanical.It is already mechanical now but we want to make it much more dull. Why do we gothrough all this? You want to have an experience, and you know drugs do youharm; therefore, you put them aside, but hope that by practicing something youwill experience something else.Why do human beings demand experience? Is the mind asleep, and experience meansa challenge? Or is the mind awake and so does not need an experience. You haveto find out if your mind is asleep, or bored with the experiences that you havehad: sex, drugs, and all the rest. You want something far beyond all that; youare always craving for more delightful, more extravagant, experience. Why doesthe mind demand experience? Ask yourself, please.There is only one thing. A mind that is very clear is free from allentanglements of attachment. Such a mind is a light to itself. Therefore, itdoes not want an experience, there is nothing to experience. You cannotexperience enlightenment. The very idea of experiencing it is a stupid thing tosay; to say, “I have achieved enlightenment,” is really dishonest. You cannotexperience truth because there must be an experiencer to experience. If there isno experiencer, there is no experience at all. But we are attached to ourexperiencer and, therefore, we are always asking for more and more and more.Meditation generally as it is accepted now is the practice of a system,breathing properly, sitting in the right position, wanting or craving greaterexperience, or the ultimate experience. This is what we are doing. And all thatis a constant struggle, a never-ending struggle. This is a never-endingstruggle, which is hoping to end all struggles! See what we have done. I amstruggling, struggling, struggling to end struggling sometime in the future. Seewhat tricks I have played on myself. I am caught in time. I don’t say, “Whyshould I struggle at all?” If I can end this struggle that is enlightenment. Tohave no shadow of conflict. But we do not want to give up all those efforts; weare caught in time. And to be free of time is to be free to have pureobservation, and then the mind becomes extraordinarily quiet. You don’t have tomake the mind quiet. If you end all conflict, the mind naturally becomes quiet.And when the mind is absolutely silent, without any movement of thought, thenperhaps you will see something, perhaps there is something sacred beyond allwords. And this man has sought everlastingly, something that is beyond measure,beyond thought, which is incorruptible, unnameable, eternal. That can only takeplace when the mind is absolutely free and completely silent.So one must begin very near, very near. And when you begin very near, there isno far. When you begin near, there is no distance and, therefore, there is notime. And it is only then that that which is most holy can be.Brockwood Park, September 6 and September 7, 1980"},{"pageContent":"THE ENDING OF SORROW [index_split_001.html#filepos6874] My friends, if you have listened to yourself, the speaker is only a mirror inwhich you see yourself as you are. If you see yourself as you are, then you canthrow away the mirror, break it. The mirror is not important. It has no value.What has value is that you see clearly in that mirror yourself as you are, thepettiness, the narrowness, the brutality, the anxieties, the fears. When youbegin to understand yourself then you go profoundly into something that isbeyond all measure. But you must take the first step. And nobody is going tohelp you to take that first step.We are thinking together, walking down a lane full of quietness and a greatsense of beauty. One wonders what beauty is. You may see some statue or pictureor a lovely head of the Buddha in a museum, or in a house, and you say howmarvelous it is; but behind the words, behind the structure of a painting, theshadows, the proportions, what is beauty? Is it in the way you look at it? Is itin the picture? Is it in the face of a person? When you see a marvelous mountainagainst a blue sky, with the great depth of a valley and snowcapped peaks, whenyou look at all that great beauty, for a moment you have forgotten yourself. Themountain is so vast, so extraordinarily lighted by the morning sun catching thehighest peaks, and your whole brain is struck by the grandeur, by the greatnessof that sight, and for a second you forget all about yourself, forget all aboutyour worries; you forget your wife, your husband, your children, your country.And you look at that with all your being, and have no sense of contradiction,duality. Its splendor is there and the self, the “me” is for a second put asideby the greatness of that beauty.As one came in, one looked at the moon, very young, new, extraordinarily simple.And, therefore, one thought, what is the point of talking at all? What is thepoint of reading books, attending meetings, what is the point of all thisexistence when one cannot look at this simple thing clearly, with great love andaffection, a simple thing, to approach life with all its complexity, simply,without all the accumulated knowledge of our past, our traditions? Just to lookat this vast movement of life, simply, with a brain that is not burdened, abrain that is active, alive, full of energy, with clarity, simplicity.Having said that, let us proceed together. We human beings have suffered a greatdeal. There have been incessant wars. For the last five thousand years there hasbeen a war practically every year, human beings killing each other, destroyingwhat they have built, great monuments being destroyed overnight. This has beenthe history of man, perpetual conflict, war. And through wars man has sufferedenormously. How many people have shed tears—for their sons, their husbands leftmaimed for life, one arm, no legs, blind. Mankind has shed tears endlessly. Andwe too are shedding tears, because our life is rather empty, lonely. And wesuffer too, all of us, not only watching the suffering of others but also thegrief, the pain, the anxiety, of our own life, the poverty of people, not thepoverty of the poor only but also the poverty of our own minds and hearts. Andwhen we begin to discover this enormous poverty, in spite of our vastinformation and knowledge, that breeds also great sorrow.There is the sorrow of loneliness, the sorrow brought about by man’s inhumanityto man, the sorrow of losing your friend, your son, your brother, your mother,and so on. We have carried this sorrow throughout our lives for centuries uponcenturies. And we have never asked if that sorrow can ever end. We are askingnow, together, looking at this sorrow of the world and the sorrow in which onelives, in your own heart, in your own mind, in your own brain. We are askingwhether that sorrow can ever end, or must men and women always carry itthroughout the future from the past. Can that sorrow ever end?As there is an art in love and so on, there is also an art in questioning,doubting; doubting one’s own conclusions, one’s own opinions, to question why wetolerate this vast burden of sorrow. Sorrow is also self-pity, the feeling ofutter loneliness, and the sorrow that is brought about through great failures,through comparison, through the whole movement of feeling a sense of lack ofrelationship to anybody. But we never go to the very end of it. We would ratherescape from it, seek some form of comfort, some form of drug that gives ussolace.So, could we not try to find an answer, not ask whether sorrow can be conquered,but be aware to see the full meaning of that word sorrow. Sorrow also means,etymologically, passion—not lust, passion. Without passion, life becomes ratherdull, meaningless. And the ending of sorrow brings about passion. So together weare looking at this word, the content of that word, the significance of thatthing called sorrow, which man has carried throughout his life—looking at it,not explaining it away, not finding the cause. There are many causes ofsorrow—the death of a son, the failure of not being successful, not being ableto fulfill, having no identification, and so on and so on—but if you areinquiring into the causes of sorrow then you are also preventing yourself fromlooking at the word, the beauty, the strength of that word.Sorrow means grief, pain, anxiety, desperate loneliness, the meaninglessness ofthis existence. All that and more is contained in that word. Can you look at itwholly, as you would hold a precious jewel, a marvelous piece of sculpture? Holdit, remain with it, and not in any way allow thought to come and interfere withthat actuality. If you can so remain with that, then that very word, thesignificance of that word, is totally ended. But we never stay with anything. Wealways want to find an end, and so we are always moving away from that veryjewel that would give us great vitality, great strength, great passion.Are we walking together, or are you merely listening to these words and gettingemotional, romantic and, therefore, never looking at that thing, the pain of it,the grief, the emptiness of one’s own being? If one can really completely holdthat jewel, it is a great jewel, but man has tried to do everything he can toescape from it; volumes have been written about it. But the books, theexplanations, the words, are not the actual. Remain with the actual, then thatvery attention brings an end to that thing that we call sorrow.Where there is sorrow there cannot be love. Love is not related to any activityof the human brain. Love is something that comes into being when there is nofear, when there is an end to sorrow. Then that very love becomes compassion,which is passion, with its immense intelligence.We are all going to die, but we human beings put that as far away as possiblefrom us; and so there is duality: living and dying. Have you ever consideredwhat duality is and whether duality, the opposite, exists at all? We have beenbrought up by tradition, by education, by the books, to think that there isduality, contradiction, man and woman, anger and not being angry, violence andnonviolence, and so on. So we have divided the whole of life into duality. Isthere such a thing as duality, is there an opposite, psychologically? Of course,there is an opposite between man and woman, between daylight and darkness,sunrise and sunset. You are taller than another, someone is fairer than another,one person is more learned than another; there is that physical duality, theopposites, dark hair, fair hair, the beautiful and the ugly.Now, psychologically, inwardly, is there an opposite? Your tradition says thereis. Books have been written about it saying that it is only the liberated whoare free from duality—which is such utter nonsense. Sorry. You and I can look atthis problem very simply—simply, not with all the complications of philosophers.There is duality outwardly, but inwardly, psychologically, inside the skin thereis only one thing. There is anger, for example, and when you say, “I must not beangry,” it becomes duality, the ideal which thought has projected, hasstructured from the pain it has. So there is only that fact. Violence is a fact,nonviolence is nonfact. So why do we give such importance to the nonfact, whichthen becomes the opposite? We are caught in this ugly business of duality, whichmeans choice, to choose.Is there an opposite, psychologically, in anything at all? There is violence,anger, hatred, dislike. Those are facts. But to invent a nonfact likenonviolence, that you must like people, and so on and so on, is just unreal.Therefore, there is only the fact. And a fact has no opposite. When we live withfact, then there is no conflict involved. Have you understood anything of this?But our whole condition is based on duality: I am this, I must not be that; I ama coward, I must be brave; I am ignorant about myself, so I must learn that. Weare caught up in this. And we are saying there is no opposite psychologically atall actually. The opposite is structured, or put together, by thought to escapefrom the actual. I am violent, that’s actual; but there are a great many peopletelling me that I must be nonviolent. The nonviolence is totally unreal, becauseI am violent. But if I remain with the actuality then I can do something aboutit, or not do anything about it, not pretend. To pursue the ideal of nonviolenceis just playing games with yourself. While you are pursuing nonviolence, you areactually violent. So we are saying there is no psychological opposite, there isonly what is. And if you understand that, then does the conflict of dualityexist at all?With that quality of brain that has understood this question of duality, let uslook at what is called living and dying. We are trying to eliminate altogetherthis conflict between what is and “what should be.” Then the brain is free andfull of energy to face things as they are. So there is the living and the dyingas two opposites. To understand both, the living and the dying, one mustapproach this nondualistically. What is living, what do you call living? Goingto the office from nine o’clock in the morning to six o’clock in the eveningevery day of your life for the next sixty years, being bossed, being bullied,and you bullying somebody else? Or you are a businessman always wanting more andmore money, more power, better position, and then go home and quarrel with yourwife, sleep with her, and beat her up verbally, or actually. And this constantstruggle, constant conflict, the utter despair, hopelessness, goes on. This iswhat we call living. And in your heart of hearts there is fear, despair,anxiety, grief. This is actuality, isn’t it? And you are frightened to leavethat, because death is coming. One is deeply identified with this so-calledliving, has taken roots in that, and is frightened to end all that.And so you say there will be a next life. Next life is the continuity of thesame old pattern, only perhaps in a different environment. If you believe in thenext life, then you must live rightly now—morally, ethically, have some sense ofhumility. But you really do not believe in the next life, you talk about it, youwrite volumes about it. If you actually believe, then you must live now rightly,because what you are now, your future will be the same. If you do not change nowyour future will be the same. This is logical. This is sane.For us, death is total ending, the ending of your attachment, ending all thatyou have collected. You cannot take it with you. You may like to have it untilthe last minute, but you cannot possibly take it with you. We have divided lifeinto dying and living, and this division has brought about great fear. Out ofthat fear we invent all kinds of theories that are very comforting; they may beillusory, but they are very comforting. Illusions are comfortably neurotic. Butis it possible, as we live, to die to things that we are attached to? If I amattached to my reputation, and death is coming along, I am getting older and Iam frightened, because I am going to lose everything. So can I be totally freeof the image, of the reputation, that people have given me? So that I am dyingas I am living. So the division between the living and dying is not miles apart,it is together. Do you understand the great beauty that each day, or eachsecond, there is no accumulation, no psychological accumulation? You have toaccumulate clothes, money, and so on, that’s a different matter, butpsychologically there is no accumulation as knowledge, as attachment, saying,“It’s mine.”Will you do it? Will you actually do this thing so that this conflict betweendeath and living, with all its pain and fear and anxiety, comes totally to anend? So that you are—the brain is—incarnated. Then the brain is being rebornafresh, so that it has tremendous freedom. So, when living, be with death, sothat you are a guest in this world, so that you have no roots anywhere, so thatyou have a brain that is amazingly alive. Because if you carry all the burdensof yesterday, your brain becomes mechanical, dull. If you leave all thepsychological memories, hurts, pains, behind, every day, then it means dying andliving are together. In that there is no fear.What happens to the person who does not do any of this? Please, this is beingsaid with great humility, with great compassion and affection. I hear from youof a totally different way of living. I see the logic of it, the sanity of it,the clarity of it. I see it intellectually, verbally I have accepted it. But Ipursue my old ways, the ways of my life, to which I am accustomed. And I amgoing to die and I am frightened, as most people are frightened. So I ask whatis going to happen? Will I be reborn?My consciousness accepts this old way of life and hopes that perhaps next lifeit will have a better chance. But is that consciousness, which I have said is“mine,” my consciousness at all? That consciousness is the consciousness ofhumanity. Each one of us shares this consciousness, so it is not mine. Please,you must question whether your consciousness is your individual consciousness oris shared by all humanity. All humanity goes through what you are going through,in a different environment, in a different ambiance. So you are not actually anindividual. You may have a different body from another, you may have a betterbank account. One may be lame, one may be healthy, but inwardly your being isshared by all the rest of humanity. Therefore, you are humanity. So as long asyou think you are an individual, you are living in illusion, because yourconsciousness, your life, is shared by everybody on this earth. So when you die,your consciousness, which is shared by all humanity, will continue. And thatconsciousness manifests itself, through someone, and then he says. “It is mine,”“I am an individual,” “Atman,” “soul,” and so on.So there is a way of living that is totally different. Then you are no longerconcerned with dying, but with living—living which contains, which moves with,death. I leave it to you. If you don’t understand, please don’t deny it, findout, question, doubt your own individuality. It is possible to live a lifepsychologically in which there is never a continual recording, there is theending of recording. Say you are flattered, or insulted, that is recorded. Now,not to record flattery or insult is to have a brain that is free, not burdenedby a thousand records of a thousand yesterdays.The religions which exist throughout the world accept dogmas, some fantasticbeliefs, some meaningless rituals. To find out what religion is, one must doubtthe accepted thing, have the vitality, the strength, to wipe it out. One mustquestion, doubt, wipe away all the structure put together by thought. When youquestion all this, to find out the nature of a religious brain, religious mind,there must be freedom to inquire. If you have a hypothesis, it must be provedunder a microscope, or under the clarity of your own attention. If a humanbeing, you, has the intention, the drive, the energy, the passion to find out ifthere is something sacred, holy, to do that there must be no fear, there must beno sense of anxiety, there must be complete freedom. And that is meditation.Meditation can only be actual, truthful, honest, when there is no fear, no hurt,no anxiety, no sorrow. Meditation can only take place when there is no consciouseffort made to meditate. I am afraid it goes against everything you believe.How do you come upon that which is sacred? Is there anything sacred? Man hassought throughout the ages something beyond. From the times of the ancientSumerians, the Egyptians, Romans, people have sought. And they worshiped light,worshiped the sun, worshiped the tree, worshiped the mother, never findinganything. So can we together discover or rather, come upon, that thing which ismost holy?That can only take place when there is absolute silence, when the brain isabsolutely quiet. You can discover for yourself—if you are attentive, watchful,watchful of your words, the meaning of the words, never saying one thing anddoing anther, if you are watchful all the time—that the brain has its ownnatural rhythm. But upon that natural rhythm thought has placed all kinds ofthings. For us, knowledge is tremendously important. To do anything physicalrequires knowledge, but psychological knowledge, the knowledge you haveaccumulated about your hurts, about your vanity, your arrogance, your ambition,all that knowledge is you. And with that knowledge we try to find out if thereis anything most holy. You can never find out through knowledge, becauseknowledge is limited, and it will always be—physically, technologically, andpsychologically.So the brain must be absolutely quiet, not through control, not throughfollowing some method, system, not by cultivating silence. Silence impliesspace. Have you noticed how little space we have in our brain? It is clutteredup, full with so many thousands of things; it has very little space. And forsilence there must be space because that which is immeasurable, that which isunnameable, cannot exist or be perceived or seen by a narrow little brain. Ifyou take a journey into yourself, empty all the content that you have collectedand go very, very deeply, then there is that vast space, that so-calledemptiness, that is full of energy.And in that state alone there is that which is most sacred, most holy.New Delhi, November 13, 1983"},{"pageContent":"TRUTH MOST HOLY [index_split_001.html#filepos7024]"},{"pageContent":"1 We are going to talk together about the whole of our existence—from the momentwe are born until we die. In that period of time, whether it be fifty years,ninety years, or a hundred years, we go through all kinds of problems anddifficulties. We have economic, social, and religious problems, problems ofpersonal relationship, problems of individual fulfillment, wanting to find rootsin some place or other. We have innumerable psychological wounds, fears,pleasures, sensations. There is a great deal of fear in all human beings, agreat deal of anxiety, uncertainty; and there is the pursuit of pleasure. Allhuman beings on this beautiful earth suffer a great deal of pain, loneliness. Weare going to talk about all that together, and about what place religion has inmodern life. We are also going to talk over together the question of death, whatis a religious mind, and what is meditation. Is there anything that is beyondthought and is there anything sacred in life, or is everything matter, so thatwe lead only a materialistic life?This is a conversation between you and the speaker in which there is noimplication of conversion, or propaganda, or of introducing new theories, ideas,and exotic nonsense. That would be too terrible. We are going to, if you willkindly, talk over together our problems as two friends. Though we don’t knoweach other, we are going to talk, discuss, have a conversation—which is muchmore important than being lectured at or being told what to do, what to believe,what to have faith in, and so on. On the contrary, we are going to observedispassionately, impersonally, not anchored to any particular problem or theory,what mankind has done to the world and what we have done to each other. We aregoing to take a very long, complex journey together, and it is yourresponsibility, as well as that of the speaker, that we walk together,investigate together, look together at the world we have created.The society in which we live is put together by man. Each one of us hascontributed to it. Life is very complex. We like to look at complexity and getmore and more complex. We never look at anything simply, with our brains, withour hearts, with our whole being. We have lived on this earth for manymillennia, and during those long periods of time mankind has sufferedloneliness, despair, uncertainty, confusion, multiple choices and, therefore,multiple complexities. There have been wars—not only physical bloody wars butalso psychological wars. And mankind has asked if there can be peace on earth.But apparently this has not been possible. There are about forty wars going onat the present time, ideological, theoretical, economic, social. Duringhistorical times, perhaps about five thousand to six thousand years, there havebeen wars practically every year. We are preparing for wars now. Two ideologies,the communist and the so-called democratic, are at war over what kind ofimplements we should use, control of armaments. War seems to be the common lotof mankind. One observes all over the world the piling up of armaments, from thetiny little nation or tribe to the highly sophisticated affluent society likeyours. How can we have peace on earth? Is it at all possible?It has been said that there is no peace on earth, only in heaven. This isrepeated in different ways, both in the East and the West. Christians havekilled more than anybody else on earth. We are observing these facts, theseactualities, not taking sides. And then there are the different religions. InBuddhism there is no god; in Hinduism somebody calculated that there are aboutthree hundred thousand gods—that’s rather fun, you can choose whichever god youlike. In Christianity and Islam there is only one god, based on two books, theBible and the Koran. So religions have divided man. Just as nationalism, whichis a glorified form of tribalism, has divided man, so has religious ardor.Fundamentalists in India, here, and in Europe, are reviving their religioustraditions. I wonder if you have ever looked at the word reviving? You can onlyrevive something that is dead or dying. You can’t revive a living thing.Man has always been in conflict. Everyone in this world goes through all kindsof misery, all kinds of sorrow, pain, desperate loneliness; and we long toescape from all that. We are observing together this extraordinary phenomenon:how man, after these thousands of years, still remains a barbarian—cruel,vulgar, full of anxiety and hatred. Violence is increasing in the world, so oneasks if there can be peace on this earth, because without peace, inwardly,psychologically, the brain cannot flower; human beings cannot live completely,holistically.Why are we human beings, after this long evolution in which we have gatheredimmense experience, knowledge, a great deal of information, still perpetually inconflict? That’s the real question. Because when there is no conflict there isnaturally peace. Without getting angry or irritated with what we areinvestigating together it is the responsibility of men and women to inquire, notmerely intellectually, verbally, but with your hearts, with your brains, withall your being, and find out why we are what we are.We have tried various religions, various economic and social systems, and yet welive in conflict. Can this conflict in each one of us end—completely, notpartially, not occasionally? It’s a very serious question. It demands a seriousanswer. Why do human beings, including you, and the speaker perhaps, live inperpetual conflict, with problems and divisions? Why have we divided the worldinto nationalities, religious groups, social behaviors? Can we seriously inquireinto whether it is possible to end conflict? First psychologically, inwardly,because if there is a certain quality of freedom inwardly, then we shall producea society in which there will be no conflict. It is our responsibility as humanbeings, as so-called individuals, seriously to put our brains, our energy, ourpassion, into discovering for ourselves—not according to any philosopher orpsychiatrist, but find out for ourselves—whether this conflict between humanbeings can end.What is conflict? Why have we lived with conflict? Why have we problems? Pleaseinquire with the speaker into these questions. What is a problem? Theetymological meaning of that word is “something thrown at you,” a challenge,something you have to answer. When you are a child, you are sent to school,where you have the problems of writing, mathematics, history, science,chemistry, and so on. So from childhood you are trained to have problems. Lookat it carefully. Your brain is conditioned, trained, educated to have problems.Observe it for yourself. We are together investigating, looking into theproblems that we have. From childhood we are trained, educated, conditioned tohave problems. And when new problems arise, as they inevitably do, it is ourbrains, full of problems, that try to solve them and thereby increase them,which is what is happening in the world. The politicians all over the world areincreasing problem after problem. And they have found no answers.Is it possible to have a brain that is free, so that you can solve problems,instead of a brain cluttered with problems? Is that possible? If you say it isor is not possible, you have stopped investigating. What is important in thisinquiry is that one must have a great deal of doubt, skepticism, never acceptinganything at its face value or according to pleasure or gratification. Life ismuch too serious.We should inquire not only into the nature of conflict and problems, but alsoperhaps into something which may be much more important: all over the world, gowhere you will, every human being on this earth goes through all kinds ofsorrow. Millions have had tears, and occasional laughter. Like you, every humanbeing on this earth has had great loneliness, despair, anxiety, has beenconfused, uncertain. Psychologically, this is a fact, an actuality. This isobservable; you can see it on every face on this earth. And so psychologicallyyou are the rest of mankind. You may be tall, short, black, or white, butpsychologically you are mankind. Please understand this—not intellectually orideologically or as a hypothesis, but as an actuality, a burning reality—thatyou psychologically are the rest of mankind. Therefore, psychologically you arenot individuals. Although religions, except perhaps parts of Hinduism andBuddhism, have entertained, encouraged, the sense of individual growth, ofsaving individual souls and all that business, in actuality your consciousnessis not yours. It is the rest of mankind’s, because we all go through the samemill, the same endless conflict. When you realize this, not emotionally, not asan intellectual concept but as something actual, real, true, then you will notkill another human being. You will never kill another, either verbally orintellectually, ideologically or physically, because then you are killingyourself.But individuality has been encouraged all over the world. Each one is strugglingfor himself, his success, his fulfillment, his achievement, pursuing his desiresand creating havoc in the world. Please understand this very carefully. We arenot saying that each individual is not important; on the contrary, if you arereally concerned with peace—globally, not just in your own little backyard—asmost serious people must be concerned, as you are the rest of humanity, that isa great responsibility.So we must find out for ourselves why human beings have reduced the world towhat it is now. What is the cause of all this? Why have we made such a mess ofeverything we touch? Why is there conflict in our personal relationships? Why isthere conflict between your god and the other’s god? We must inquire togetherinto whether it is possible to end conflict. Otherwise we will never have peacein this world. Peace on earth was talked about long before Christianity. Longbefore Christianity, people worshiped trees, stones, animals, lightning, thesun; there was no sense of “God” because they considered the earth as the motherto be worshiped, to be preserved, spared, not destroyed as we are doing now.Without agreeing or disagreeing, can all of us look at things as they are; notas you think they are, not from your idea or concept of what is, but just look?Look nonverbally, if that’s possible; that’s much more difficult.First of all, this is the actual world we live in. You cannot possibly escapefrom it through monasteries, through religious experiences. One must doubt allone’s experiences. Man has done everything on earth possible to run away fromthe actuality of daily living with all its complexities. Why do we have conflictin relationship between man and woman, sexual division? In this peculiarrelationship, the man is pursuing his own ambition, his own greed, his owndesires, his own fulfillment, and the woman is doing the same. So there are twoambitious, driving beings, driven by desire, two parallel lines never meeting,except perhaps sexually. How can there be a relationship between two people wheneach one is pursuing his own desires, ambitions, greeds? In this relationship,because there is this division, there is no love. That word love is spoiled,spat upon, degraded; it has become merely sensuous, pleasurable. Love is notpleasure. Love is not something put together by thought. It is not somethingdependent on sensation. So how can there be right, true relationship between twopeople when each one considers his own importance? Self-interest is thebeginning of corruption, destruction, whether it be in the politician or thereligious man. Self-interest dominates the world and, therefore, there isconflict.There is separation, as the Jew and the Arab, as the Christian who believes insome savior and the Hindu who doesn’t. There is national division, religiousdivision, individual divisions. Where there is division there must be conflict.That is a law. So we live our daily life in a little circumscribed self, alimited self. Self is always limited and that is the cause of conflict. That isthe central core of our struggle, pain, anxiety.One becomes aware of it, as most people must naturally, not because you’re toldto or because you read some book of philosophy or psychology, but because it’san actual fact. Each one is concerned with himself. He lives in a separate worldall to himself. And, therefore, there is division between you and another,between you and your religion, between you and your god, between you and yourideologies. So is it possible to understand, not intellectually but deeply, thatyou are the rest of mankind? Whatever you do, good or bad, affects the rest ofmankind because you are mankind.Your consciousness is not yours. Your consciousness is made up of its content.Without the content there is no consciousness. Your consciousness, like that ofthe rest of humanity, is made up of beliefs, fears, faith, gods, personalambitions. Your whole consciousness is made up of all this, put together bythought.One hopes that we have taken the journey together, that together we are walkingthe same road, not that you are listening to a series of ideas. We are notpursuing ideas or ideologies, but facing actuality, because in actuality andgoing beyond that actuality is the truth. And when there is truth it is the mostdangerous thing. Truth is very dangerous because it brings a revolution inoneself.Have you ever gone into the question of why we ask questions? Not that youshould not, but we are inquiring. Suppose you ask the speaker a question and heanswers it; either you accept it or deny it. If it is satisfactory to youaccording to your conditioning or your background, then you say, “Yes, I agreewith you entirely.” Or if you don’t agree, you say, “What nonsense.” But if youbegin to inquire into the question itself, is the answer separate from thequestion? Or does the answer lie in the question itself? The perfume of a floweris the flower. The very flower is the essence of that perfume. But we depend onothers so much to be helped, to be encouraged, to solve our problems; therefore,out of our confusion we create authority, the gurus, the priests.It is good to ask questions. You know, we have lost the art of investigation,discussion, not taking sides but looking at things. It is very complex.We should also ask why, from childhood, we are hurt psychologically. Most of usare wounded psychologically, and from that wound, whether one is conscious of itor not, many of our problems arise. A child is wounded by a scolding, by hearingsomething ugly, brutal, violent. When you say “I am wounded,” who is it that iswounded? Is it the image that you have built about yourself that is wounded, thepsyche? The psyche is the “me” and the me is the image I have built aboutmyself. There is nothing spiritual about it. That’s another ugly word,spiritual. So that image gets hurt and we carry that image right through ourlife. If one image is not pleasant, we put together another image which ispleasant, encouraging it as worthwhile, significant, giving intellectual meaningto our life.Is it possible to live on this earth not having a single image aboutanybody—including god, if there is such an entity—no image about your wife andyour children and your husband, or anyone? Not to have a single image? Then itis possible never to be hurt.Just to observe without any distortion is entirely different from analysis, asyou observe your neighbor’s dress, face, how he talks; just to observe, not tocriticize, not to evaluate, judge, but to observe. Observe a tree, observe themoon and the swift-running waters. When you so observe then you ask yourself,what is beauty?They talk a great deal about beauty in the magazines: how you must be beautiful,your face, your hair, your complexion. What is beauty? Is beauty in the picture,in the painting, in the strange modern structure? Is beauty in a poem? Is beautymerely in the physical face and body? Have you ever asked this question? If youare an artist or a poet or a literary person, you may describe something verybeautiful, paint something that is lovely, write a poem that really stirs yourvery being. So what is beauty? Have you ever noticed that when you give a nicetoy, a complicated toy, to a child who is being naughty, he gets completelyabsorbed in it and all his naughtiness stops because he is absorbed? Is beingabsorbed in a poem, in a face, in a picture, beauty? When you look at amarvelous mountain with a cap of eternal snows, its line against the blue sky,for a second the immensity of that mountain drives away the self, the “me,” withall my problems, all my anxiety. In seeing the majesty of the great rocks andthe lovely valleys and the rivers, at that moment, that second, the self is not.So the mountain has driven away the self, as the toy quiets the child. Thatmountain, that river, the depth of the blue valleys, dispel for a second allyour problems, all your vanities and anxieties. Then you say, “How beautifulthat is.” But is there beauty without being absorbed by something outside? Thatis, beauty is where the self is not.So beauty is when the self is not. That requires great meditation, greatinquiry, a tremendous sense of discipline. The word discipline means thedisciple who is learning from the master; learning, not disciplining as inconforming, imitating, adjusting. Learning brings its own tremendous discipline,and for an inward sense of austerity discipline is necessary.We must also inquire carefully into whether it is possible to be free of fear.This is really an important question to ask. I am not asking it for you, but youare asking this of yourself. Is it possible, living in modern society with allthe brutality, with all the tremendous violence that is on the increase, to havefreedom from fear? What is fear? Humanity has put up with fear, has never beenable to solve fear. Never. There are various forms of fear. You may have yourown particular fear: fear of death, fear of gods, fear of the devil, fear ofyour wife, fear of your husband, fear of the politicians. God knows how manyfears humanity has. What is fear? Not the mere experience of fear in itsmultiple forms, but the reality, the actuality, of fear? How is it broughtabout? Why has humanity, which is each one of us, accepted fear as a way oflife—violence on television, violence in our daily life, and the ultimateviolence of organized killing, which is called war? Is not fear related toviolence? We are inquiring into fear, the actual truth of fear, not the idea offear. The idea of fear is different from the actuality of fear.So what is fear? How has it come about? What is the relationship of fear totime, to thought? One may be frightened of tomorrow, or of many tomorrows, orhave fear of what has happened before, in the past, or be in fear of what isactually going on now. And the fear of death is the ultimate fear. Is fearbrought about by time? Someone has done something in the past to hurt you, andthe past is time. The future is time. The present is time. So we are asking, istime a central factor of fear? Fear has many, many branches, many leaves, butit’s no good trimming the branches. We are asking what the root of fear is; notthe multiple forms of fear, because fear is fear. Out of fear you have inventedgods, saviors. If you have absolutely no fear psychologically, then there istremendous relief, a great sense of freedom. You have dropped all the burdens oflife.So we must inquire very seriously, closely, hesitantly, into this question: Istime a factor? Obviously. I have a good job now; I may lose it tomorrow, so I’mfrightened. When there is fear, there is jealousy, anxiety, hatred, violence. Sotime is a factor of fear. Time is a factor and thought is a factor, thinkingabout what has happened, what might happen. Isn’t thinking a factor in fear? Hasthinking brought about fear? One sees that time has brought fear. Time is notonly time by the clock, but psychological time, the inward time: “I am going tobe—”; “I am not good, but I will be”; “I will get rid of my violence,” which isagain the future. All that implies time.Are you prepared for all this? Do you want to go into all this? If you do, I’mrather surprised, because you have all been instructed, informed, you have beentold what to do by the psychologists, by the priests, by your leaders; you arealways seeking help and finding new ways of being helped. So one has become aslave to others. One is never free to inquire, to stand psychologicallycompletely by oneself.We are now going to inquire into time. What is time? Apart from the clock, apartfrom the sunrise and the sunset, apart from the light and the dark, what istime? Please, if you really understand the nature of time inwardly, you willfind for yourself an extraordinary sense of having no time at all.Time is the past, time is the future, and time is the present. The whole cycleis time. The past is your background, what you have thought, what you have livedthrough, your experiences, your conditioning as a Christian, a Hindu, aBuddhist. Without the past you wouldn’t be here. You have been programmed like acomputer, repeating, repeating, repeating, for two thousand years, and theHindus for three to five thousand years. So the past is the present; what youare now is the result of the past. And tomorrow, or a thousand tomorrows, iswhat you are now, so the future is now. In the now, all time is contained. Thisis a fact too, an actuality, not a theory. What you are is the result of thepast and what you will be tomorrow is what you are now. If I am violent now,tomorrow I will be violent. So tomorrow is in the now, in the present, unless Iradically, fundamentally, bring about a mutation. Otherwise I will be what Ihave been. We have had a long evolution, evolving to what we are now. And if wecarry on that game, we will be violent, we will be barbarous the next day. So asall time is contained in the now—which is a fact, an actuality—can there betotal mutation now in all our behavior and our way of living, thinking, feeling?Because if we don’t radically, psychologically bring about a mutation, then wewill be exactly what we have been in the past. Is it possible to bring aboutthis psychological mutation at all?You know, when you have been going north all your life, following a particulardirection, or no direction, just wobbling as most people do, if somebody comesalong and tells you most seriously that going north leads nowhere, there isnothing at the end of it, you listen seriously, not only with the hearing of theear but deeply. “Go east or south,” you are told, and you say, “I will do it.”At that moment you have taken a new turn and there is a mutation. The speaker ismaking it very simple, but it is a very complex problem: to realize deeply thatwe have been going on this way for centuries and we have not changed at all. Weare still violent, brutal, and all the rest of it. If we actually perceive that,not intellectually or verbally but deeply, then we turn in another direction. Atthat second there is the mutation in the very brain cells themselves.We said time is important because we live by time, but we don’t live time as awhole, which is the present. In the present all time is contained, the futureand the past. If I am violent today, I will be violent tomorrow. But can I endthat violence today completely, not partially? I can. And is fear brought aboutby thought? Of course it is. Don’t accept the speaker’s word for it, look at it.I am secure today, but I am frightened of what might happen tomorrow: theremight be war, there might be some other catastrophe. So time and thought are theroot of fear.Now what is thinking? If time and thought are the root of fear—which they are inactuality—what is thinking? Why do we live, act, do everything, on the basis ofthought? The marvelous cathedrals of Europe, their beauty, structure,architecture, have been put together by thought. All religions and theirparaphernalia, their medieval robes, are put together by thought. All therituals are contrived, arranged, by thought. And our relationship with eachother, man and woman, is based on thought. When you drive a car, it is based onthought. Recognition is thought. So one has to inquire into what thinking is.Probably very few people have asked this question. The speaker has been askingthis question for sixty years. What is thought? If you can find out what is theorigin, the beginning of thought, why thought has become so extraordinarilyimportant in our life, there may be in that very inquiry a mutation takingplace. So we are asking what is thought, what is thinking? Don’t wait for me toanswer. Look at it, observe it.Thinking is the word. The word is important, the sound of the word, the qualityof the word, the depth, the beauty of a word. Especially the sound. Thinking ispart of memory, isn’t it? If we had no memory at all, would we be able to think?We wouldn’t. Our brain is the instrument of memory—memory of things that havehappened, experience, and so on, the whole background of memory. Memory arisesfrom knowledge, from experience. So experience, knowledge, memory, and theresponse of memory, is thought. This whole process of experiencing,recollecting, holding, becomes our knowledge. Experience is always limited,naturally. Is experience different from the experiencer? Give your brain tothis, find out! If there is no experiencer, is there an experience? Of coursenot. So the experience and the experiencer are the same, like the observer andthe observed. The thinker is not separate from his thoughts. The thinker is thethought.So experience is limited, as you can observe in the scientific world or anyother field. They are adding more and more and more every day to their knowledgethrough experience, through experiments on animals and all that horror that isgoing on. And that knowledge is limited because it can be added to. So memory islimited. And from that memory thought is limited. So thought, being limited,must invariably bring about conflict. Just see the pattern of it; don’t acceptwhat the speaker is saying. That’s absurd; he is not an authority, he is not aguru. We can observe this fact together, that thought and time are the root offear. Time and thought are the same, they are not two separate movements. Seethis fact, this actuality, that time and thought, time-thought, are the root offear. Just observe it in yourself. Don’t move away from the reality, from thetruth that fear is caused by time and thought. Hold it, remain with it, don’trun away from it. It is so. Then it is like holding a precious jewel in yourhand. You see all the beauty of that jewel. Then you will see for yourself thatfear psychologically completely ends. And when there is no fear you are free.And when there is that total freedom you don’t have gods, rituals, you are afree man.When you yourself become both the teacher and the disciple—disciple being a manwho is learning, learning, learning, not accumulating knowledge—then you are anextraordinary human being.Washington. D.C., April 20, 1985"},{"pageContent":"2 We are going to face the truth of things, not live in delusions. With delusionsit is very difficult to observe. If you are deluding yourself and not facingactualities, then it becomes impossible to look at oneself as one is. But welike delusions, illusions, every form of deception, because we are frightened tolook at ourselves. To look at ourselves very clearly, accurately, precisely, isonly possible in the mirror of relationship; that is the only mirror we have. Inthe mirror of relationship you see what you are, if you allow yourself to seewhat you are.We want everlasting pleasure in different ways: sexual, sensory, intellectual,the pleasure of possession, the pleasure of acquiring a great skill, thepleasure one derives from having a great deal of information, knowledge, and theultimate gratification of what we call “God.” Man has pursued pleasureendlessly, in the name of God, in the name of peace, in the name of ideology.And then there is the pleasure of power, having power over others, politicalpower. Have you noticed that power is an ugly thing, when one dominates anotherin any form? Power is one of the evil things in life. And pleasure is the otherside of the coin of fear. When one understands deeply, profoundly, seriously,the nature of fear, then pleasure is delight, seeing something beautiful, seeingthe sunset or the morning light, the dawn, the marvelous colors, the reflectionof the sun on the waters. That is delight; but we cultivate that memory aspleasure.What is action? We are all so active from morning till night, not onlyphysically but psychologically, the brain everlastingly chattering, going fromone thing to another endlessly. During the day and during the night in dreamsthe brain is never at rest, it is perpetually in motion. What is action, thedoing? The very word doing is in the present, it is not having done or “I willdo.” Action means the doing now, accurately, completely, holistically, if I canuse that word, action that is whole, complete, not partial. When action is basedon some ideology, it is not action, is it? It is conformity to a certain patternthat you have established and, therefore, it is incomplete, action according tosome memory, some conclusion. If you act according to a certain ideology,pattern, or conclusion, it is incomplete; there is a contradiction in it.Is action related to disorder or to order? We live in disorder, our life isdisorderly, confused, contradictory—saying one thing, doing another; thinkingone thing and doing quite the opposite. What is order and what is disorder andwhat is the relationship of action to order and disorder?What is disorder? Look at the world, if you will; the world is in disorder.Terrible things are happening. Very few of us know actually what is happening inthe scientific world, in the world of the art of war, all the terrible thingsthat are going on in other countries; the poverty in all countries, the rich andthe terribly poor, always the threat of war, one political group against anotherpolitical group. So there is this tremendous disorder. That is an actuality, notan invention or an illusion. We have created this disorder, because our veryliving is disorderly. And we are trying to bring about order through the socialreforms. Without understanding and bringing about the end of disorder, we try tofind order. It is like a confused mind trying to find clarity. A confused mindis a confused mind; it can never find clarity. So can there be an end todisorder in our life, our daily life? Not order in heaven or in another place,but in our daily life can there be order? Can there be the end of disorder? Whenthere is the end of disorder there is naturally order. That order is living thatis not according to a pattern or mold.We are investigating, looking at ourselves and learning about ourselves.Learning is different from acquiring knowledge. If you will please kindly giveyour attention to this a little bit, learning is an infinite process, alimitless process, whereas knowledge is always limited. And learning implies notonly observing visually, optically, but also observing without any distortion,seeing things exactly as they are. That requires the discipline of one who islearning, not the terrible discipline of orthodoxy, tradition, or followingcertain rules, dictates. It is learning through clear observation, hearingexactly what the other fellow is saying without any distortion. And learning isnot accumulative because you are moving. In learning what disorder is inourselves, order comes about very naturally, easily, unexpectedly. And whenthere is order, order is virtue. There is no other virtue except complete order;that is complete morality, not some imposed or dictated morality.Every human being, whether rich or poor, intellectual or just ordinary laymenlike us, goes through every form of suffering. Have you ever looked at peoplewho have cried through centuries? Through thousands of wars? There is immensesorrow in the world. Not that there is not also pleasure, joy, and so on, but inunderstanding and perhaps ending sorrow we will find something much greater. Cansorrow ever end or is mankind doomed forever to suffer, to suffer not onlyphysically but psychologically? Inwardly we have suffered enormously withoutperhaps saying a word about it, or crying our hearts out. During all this longevolution of man from the beginning of time until now, every human being on thisearth has suffered. Suffering is not merely the loss of someone you think youlike or love, but also the suffering of the very poor, the illiterate. If you goto India or other parts of the world, you see people walking miles and miles togo to a school, little girls and little boys. They will never be rich, they willnever ride in a car, probably never have a hot bath. They have one sari and thatis all. And that is sorrow. And the man who goes by in a car, who looks at this,is in sorrow, if he is at all sensitive, aware. And there is the sorrow ofignorance; not ignorance of writing and literature, and so on, but the sorrow ofa man who does not know himself. There are multiple ways of sorrow.Can this sorrow end for each one? There is the sorrow in oneself and the sorrowof the world. There have been thousands of wars, people maimed, appallingcruelty. Every nation on earth has committed cruelties. It is appalling andwe’re still perpetuating that cruelty. Cruelty brings enormous sorrow. As humanbeings, just observing, being aware sensitively of all this, we see sorrow is aterrible thing, and ask if that sorrow can end. Please ask yourself whethersorrow can ever end? Because, as with hatred, when there is sorrow there is nolove. When you are suffering, concerned with your own suffering, how can therebe love? So one must ask this question, however difficult it is, to find not theanswer but the ending of sorrow.What is sorrow? Is sorrow self-pity? Please, investigate. We’re not saying it isor it is not, we are asking. Is sorrow brought about by self-pity? Is that oneof the factors? Is sorrow brought about by loneliness, feeling desperatelyisolated, and in that isolation having no relationship with anything?Is sorrow merely an intellectual affair to be rationalized, explained away? Orcan one live with it without any desire for comfort? That is, to live withsorrow, not escape from it, not rationalize it, not find some exclusive comfort,some religious or illusory romantic escape, but to live with something that hastremendous significance. Sorrow is not only a physical shock; when one losesone’s son or husband, wife or girl, that is a tremendous biological shock; oneis almost paralyzed with it. Can we look at sorrow as it actually is in us, andremain with it, hold it, and not move away from it? Sorrow is not different fromthe one who suffers. The person who suffers wants to run away, escape, do allkinds of things. But to look at it as you look at a beautiful child, to hold it,never escape from it, then you will see for yourself, if you really look deeply,that there is an end to sorrow. And when there is an end to sorrow, there ispassion. Not lust, not sensory stimulation, but passion. Very few have thispassion, because we are so consumed with our own griefs, with our own pains,with our own pity and vanity. We have tremendous energy, but we dissipate it byconflict, through fear, through endless chattering about nothing. And passionhas tremendous energy. That passion is not stimulated. It doesn’t seekstimulation; it is there, like a burning fire. It only comes when there is theend of sorrow.When you have the ending of this sorrow, it is not personal, because you are therest of humanity. We all suffer; we all go through loneliness; every human beingon this earth, rich or poor, learned or ignorant, goes through tremendousanxieties, conscious or unconscious. Your consciousness is not yours, it ishuman consciousness. In the content of that consciousness are all your beliefs,your sorrows, your pities, your vanities, your arrogance, your search for power,position. All that is your consciousness, which is shared by all human beings.Therefore, it is not your particular consciousness. And when you really realizethat—not verbally or intellectually or theoretically or as a concept, but as anactuality—then you’ll not kill another, hurt another. You will have some otherthing which is totally different, of a different dimension altogether.What is love? We use the word love so loosely. It has become merely sensuous,sexual; love is identified with pleasure. And to find that perfume one must gointo what is not love. Through negation you come to the positive, not the otherway round. Through negation of what is not love you come to that which isimmensely true, which is love.Love is not hate, that is obvious. Love is not vanity, arrogance. Love is not inthe hand of power: wanting power, whether over a small child or over a group ofpeople or a nation, surely is not love. Love is not pleasure. Love is notdesire. Love is certainly not thought. When you are ambitious, aggressive—as youare all brought up to be successful, to be famous, to be known, which is all soutterly childish—how can there be love?So love is something that cannot be invited or cultivated. It comes aboutnaturally, easily, when the other things are not. And in learning about oneself,one comes upon this. Where there is love, there is compassion; and compassionhas its own intelligence. That is the supreme form of intelligence, not theintelligence of thought, of cunning and deception. It is only when there iscomplete love and compassion that there is that excellence of intelligence thatis not mechanical.Shall we talk about death? Are you interested in finding out what death is? Whatis the meaning of that word death, the dying, the ending? Not only the endingbut what happens after death? Does one carry the memories of one’s own life? Thewhole Asiatic world believes in reincarnation; that is, I die, having led amiserable life, perhaps done a little good here and there, and next life I willbe better, I will do more good. It is based on reward and punishment, likeeverything else in life. And in Christianity there is resurrection, and so on.If we put all that aside for the moment, really put it aside, not cling to onething or the other, then what is death? What does it mean to die? Not onlybiologically, physically, but also psychologically. You have acquired all theaccumulation of memories, one’s tendencies, skills, idiosyncrasies, the thingsthat one has gathered, whether it be money, knowledge, friendship; and deathcomes and says, “Sorry, you can’t take anything with you.” What does it mean todie? What is death? How do we inquire into it? I am living, I go along everyday; it is routine, mechanical, miserable, happy, unhappy. And death comes,through accident, through disease, through old age, senility. We are frightenedof death, we never see the greatness of this extraordinary thing. A child isborn, a new human being comes into being. That is an extraordinary event. Andthat child grows and becomes whatever you have all become, and then dies. Deathis also something most extraordinary; it must be; and you won’t see the depthand the greatness of it if you are frightened.Death means surely the ending of everything, the ending of my relationships, theending of all the things I have put together in my life, all the knowledge, allthe experience. I’ve led an idiotic life, a meaningless life, or I have tried tofind intellectually a meaning to life; then death comes and says, “That’s theend.” But I am frightened, it can’t be the end. I’ve got so much, I’ve collectedso much, not only furniture or pictures. I identify myself with the furniture orthe pictures or the bank account so I am the bank account, the pictures, thefurniture. When you identify with something so completely, you are that. I haveestablished roots. I have established a great many things round me. And deathcomes and makes a clean sweep of all that. So I ask myself, is it possible tolive with death all the time? Not at the end of ninety or a hundred years, notat the end of my life but with all my energy, vitality, and all the things thatgo on, can I live with death all the time? Not commit suicide, I don’t meanthat, that’s too silly, but live with death, which means the ending every day ofevery thing I’ve collected. The ending.Have you gone into the question of what continuity is and what ending is? Thatwhich continues can never renew itself, be reborn. So can I live with death,which means that everything that I have done and collected ends? Ending is moreimportant than continuity. The ending means the beginning of something new. Ifyou merely continue, it is the same pattern being repeated in a different mold.So can I live with death? That means freedom, complete, total, holistic freedom.And in that freedom there is great love and compassion, and that intelligencewhich has not an end, which is immense.Man has always sought something beyond all this pain, anxiety, and sorrow. Isthere something that is sacred, eternal, that is beyond all the reaches ofthought? This has been a question from the most ancient of times. What issacred? What is that which has no time, that which is incorruptible, that whichis nameless, that which has no quality, no limitation, the timeless, theeternal? Is there such a thing? Man has asked this for thousands and thousandsof years. So he has worshiped the sun, the earth, nature, the trees, the birds;everything that’s living on this earth man has worshiped since ancient times.The Vedas and the Upanishads never mention God. That which is supreme, theysaid, is not manifested.So are you asking that question too? Are you asking if there is somethingsacred? Is there something that is not put together by thought, as all organizedreligions are? What is religion? Not only what is religion, but what is thereligious brain, religious mind? To inquire into that deeply, not superficially,there must be total freedom. Not freedom from one thing or the other, butfreedom as a whole, per se. Is it possible, living in this ugly world, to befree from pain, sorrow, anxiety, loneliness?If there is order in one’s life, real order, then what is meditation? Is itfollowing certain systems, methods: the Zen method, the Buddhist meditation, theHindu meditation, and the methods of the latest gurus? If meditation isdetermined, if it is following a system, a method, practiced day after day, whathappens to the human brain? It becomes more and more dull. Is meditationsomething entirely different? It has nothing whatever to do with method, system,practices; therefore, it can never be mechanical. It can never be consciousmeditation. It is like a man consciously wanting money and pursuing money:consciously you meditate, wanting to achieve peace, silence. The man who pursuesmoney, success, power, and the man who pursues so-called spirituality are boththe same.Is there a meditation which is not determined, practiced? There is, but thatrequires enormous attention. That attention is a flame and that attention is notsomething that you come to; it is attention now to everything, every word, everygesture, every thought; it is to pay complete attention, not partial. If you arelistening partially now, you are not giving complete attention. When you arecompletely attentive there is no self, there is no limitation.The brain now is full of information, cluttered up, there is no space in it, andone must have space. Space means energy. When there is no space, your energy isvery limited. The brain is now so heavily laden with knowledge, with theories,with power, position, so everlastingly in conflict and cluttered up, that it hasno space. And freedom, complete freedom, is to have that limitless space. Thebrain is extraordinarily capable, has infinite capacity, but we have made itsmall and petty. When there is that space and emptiness and, therefore, immenseenergy—energy is passion, love and compassion and intelligence—then there isthat truth which is most holy, most sacred, that which man has sought from timeimmemorial. That truth does not lie in any temple, in any mosque, in any church.And it has no path to it except through one’s own understanding of oneself,inquiring, studying, learning. Then there is that which is eternal.Washington.
