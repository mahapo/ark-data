[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM by Michael Bakunin This pamphlet is an excerpt from The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution and included in The Complete Wor ks of Michael Bakunin under the title \"Fragment.\" Parts of the text were originally translated into English by G.P. M aximoff for his anthology of Bakunin's writings, w ith missing paragraphs translated by Jeff Stein from the Spanish edition, Diego Abad de Santillan, trans. (Buenos Aires 1926) vol. III, p p. 181- 196. Is it necessary to repeat here the irrefutable argum ents of S ocialism which no bourge ois econom ist has yet succeeded in disprovi ng? What is prope rty, what is capital in their pre sent form ? For the capitalist and the prope rty ow ner they mean the pow er and the right, gua ranteed by t he State, to live without working. A nd since neither prope rty nor c apital produc es anything w hen not fertilized by l abor - t hat means the pow er and the right to live by e xploiting the work of s omeone else, the right to exploit the work of t hose who pos sess neither prope rty nor c apital and w ho thus are forced to sell their produc tive pow er to the lucky ow ners of bot h. Note that I ha ve left out of account altogether the following que stion: In w hat way did prope rty and capital ever fall into the hands of their pre sent owners? This is a question w hich, when envisaged from the points of vi ew of history, l ogic, and justice, cannot be answered in any ot her way but one which would serve as an indictment against the present owners. I shall therefore confine myself here to the statement that prope rty ow ners and capitalists, inasmuch as they live not by t heir ow n produc tive labor but by getting land re nt, hous e rent, interest upon t heir capital, or by s peculation on l and, bui ldings, and capital, or by t he commercial and indus trial exploitation of t he manual labor of t he prol etariat, all live at the expense of the prol etariat. (Speculation and exploitation no doubt also constitute a sort of labor, but altogether non-produc tive labor.) I know only too w ell that this mode of life is highly esteemed in all civilized count ries, that it is expre ssly and tenderly prot ected by a ll the States, and that the States, religions, and all the juridical laws, bot h criminal and civil, and all the political gove rnments, monarchies and re publ ican - w ith their immense judicial and pol ice apparatuses and their standing armies - ha ve no ot her mission but to consecrate and prot ect such pra ctices. In t he presence of these pow erful and re spectable authorities I cannot even permit myself to ask whether this mode of life is legitimate from the point of vi ew of hum an justice, liberty, hum an equality, and fra ternity. I s imply ask myself: Under such condi tions, are fraternity and equality pos sible between the exploiter and the exploited, are justice and fre edom possible for t he exploited? Let us even suppos e, as it is being m aintained by t he bourge ois econom ists and w ith them all the lawyers, all the worshippers and be lievers in the juridical right, all the priests of the civil and criminal code - let us suppos e that this econom ic relationship between the exploiter and the exploited is altogether legitimate, that it is the inevitable consequence, the produc t of a n eternal, indestructible social law, yet still it will always be true that exploitation pre cludes brot herhood a nd equality. It goes without saying that it precludes econom ic equality. Suppos e I am your w orke r and you a re my employer. If I offe r my labor a t the lowest price, if I consent to have you l ive off m y labor, i t is certainly not because of de votion or brot herly love for you. A nd no bourge ois econom ist would dare to say that it was, how ever idyllic and na ive their reasoning be comes when they begin to speak about reciproc al affections and m utual relations which shoul d exist between employers and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"employees. No, I do i t because my family and I w ould starve to death if I di d not work for a n employer. Thus I am forc ed to sell you m y labor a t the lowest possible price, and I a m forc ed to do it by t he threat of hunge r. But - the econom ists tell us - the prope rty ow ners, the capitalists, the employers, are likewise forced to seek out and purc hase the labor of t he prol etariat. Yes, it is true, they are forc ed to do i t, but not in the same measure. Had there been equality between those who offe r their labor a nd those who purc hase it, between the necessity of s elling one 's labor a nd the necessity of buyi ng it, the slavery and m isery of t he prol etariat would not exist. But then there would be neither capitalists, nor prope rty ow ners, nor t he prol etariat, nor ri ch, nor poor: there would onl y be worke rs. It is precisely because such equality doe s not exist that we have and are bound t o have exploiters. This equality doe s not exist because in modern society where wealth is produc ed by t he intervention of c apital paying w ages to labor, t he grow th of t he popul ation out strips the grow th of produc tion, w hich results in the suppl y of l abor ne cessarily surpa ssing the demand and leading to a relative sinking of t he level of w ages. Produc tion thus constituted, m onopol ized, exploited by bourge ois capital, is pushed on t he one hand by t he mutual competition of t he capitalists to concentrate evermore in the hands of a n ever diminishing num ber of pow erful capitalists, or i n the hands of joint-stock companies which, ow ing to the merging of t heir capital, are more pow erful than the biggest isolated capitalists. (And the small and m edium-sized capitalists, not being able to produc e at the same price as the big capitalists, naturally succumb in the deadly struggl e.) On the other hand, a ll enterprises are forc ed by t he same competition to sell their produc ts at the lowest possible price. It [capitalist monopol y] can attain this two-fol d result only by forc ing out an ever- grow ing num ber of s mall or m edium-sized capitalists, speculators, merchants, or i ndus trialists, from the world of e xploiters into the world of t he exploited prol etariat, and at the same time squeezing out ever gre ater savings from the wages of the same prol etariat. On the other hand, t he mass of the prol etariat, grow ing as a result of the general increase of the popul ation - w hich, as we know , not even pove rty can stop effectively - a nd through t he increasing proletarianization of t he petty-bourge oisie, ex-ow ners, capitalists, merchants, and indus trialists - grow ing, a s I ha ve said, at a much more rapid rate than the produc tive capacities of a n econom y that is exploited by bourge ois capital - this grow ing m ass of the prol etariat is placed in a condi tion wherein the worke rs are forc ed into disastrous competition against one another. For since they pos sess no ot her means of e xistence but their ow n manual labor, t hey are driven, by the fear of s eeing themselves replaced by ot hers, to sell it at the lowest price. This tendency of the worke rs, or ra ther the necessity to which they are conde mned by t heir ow n pove rty, combined with the tendency of t he employers to sell the produc ts of their worke rs, and consequently buy t heir labor, a t the lowest price, constantly reproduc es and consolidates the pove rty of t he prol etariat. Since he finds himself in a state of pove rty, the worke r is compelled to sell his labor for a lmost nothing, a nd be cause he sells that produc t for a lmost nothing, he sinks into ever gre ater pove rty. Yes, gre ater misery, indeed! For in this galley-slave labor t he produc tive forc e of the worke rs, abused, rut hlessly exploited, excessively wasted and unde rfed, is rapidly used up. A nd onc e used up, w hat can be its value on t he market, of w hat worth is this sole commodity which he possesses and upon t he daily sale of w hich he depends for a livelihood? Nothing! A nd then? Then not hing is left for t he worke r but to die. What, in a given count ry, is the lowest possible wage? It is the price of that which is considered by the prol etarians of that count ry as absolutely necessary to keep one self alive. All the bourge ois econom ists are in agreement on t his point. Turgot , who saw fit to call himself the `virtuous minister' of Louis XVI, and re ally was an hone st man, said: \"The simple worke r who ow ns nothing m ore than his hands, has nothing else to sell than his labor. H e sells it more or less expensively; but its price whether high or l ow, doe s not depend on him alone: it depends on a n agreement with whoever will pay for hi s labor. T he employer pays as"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"little as possible; when given the choice between a great num ber of w orke rs, the employer pre fers the one who w orks cheap. The worke rs are, then, forc ed to lower their price in competition each against the other. In a ll types of labor, i t necessarily fol lows that the salary of t he worke r is limited to what is necessary for s urvival.\" (Re flexions sur la form ation et la distribution de s richesses) J.B. S ay, the true father of bourge ois econom ists in France also said: \"Wages are much higher when more demand exists for l abor a nd less if offe red, and are lowered accordingly when more labor i s offe red and less demanded. It is the relation be tween suppl y and de mand w hich regulates the price of this merchandise called the worke rs' labor, a s are regulated all other publ ic services. When wages rise a little higher than the price necessary for t he worke rs' families to maintain themselves, their children multiply and a larger suppl y soon de velops in proport ion w ith the greater demand. W hen, on t he contrary, the demand for w orke rs is less than the quantity of pe ople offe ring to work, t heir gains decline back to the price necessary for t he class to maintain itself at the same num ber. The families more burde ned with children disappear; from them forw ard the suppl y of labor de clines, and w ith less labor be ing offe red, the price rises... In s uch a way it is difficult for t he wages of the labore r to rise above or fa ll below the price necessary to maintain the class (the worke rs, the prol etariat) in the num ber required.\" (Cours complet d' econom ie politique) After citing T urgot and J.B. S ay, Proudhon c ries: \"The price, as compared to the value (in real social econom y) is something essentially mobile, consequently, essentially variable, and that in its variations, it is not regulated more than by t he concurrence, concurrence, let us not forge t, that as Turgot and S ay agree, has the necessary effect not to give to wages to the worke r more than enough to barely pre vent death by s tarvation, a nd m aintain the class in the num bers needed.\"1 The current price of pri mary ne cessities constitutes the prevailing constant level above which worke rs' wages can never rise for a very long t ime, but beneath which they drop ve ry oft en, which constantly results in inanition, s ickness, and de ath, unt il a sufficient num ber of w orke rs disappear to equalize again the suppl y of a nd de mand for l abor. W hat the econom ists call equalized suppl y and demand doe s not constitute real equality between those who offe r their labor for s ale and those who purc hase it. Suppos e that I, a manufa cturer, ne ed a hundre d worke rs and that exactly a hundre d worke rs present themselves in the market - onl y one hundre d, for i f more came, the suppl y would exceed demand, re sulting in lowered wages. But since only one hundre d appear, and since I, the manufa cturer, ne ed onl y that num ber - ne ither more nor l ess - it would seem at first that complete equality was established; that suppl y and de mand be ing equal in num ber, they shoul d likewise be equal in other respects. Does it follow that the worke rs can demand from me a wage and condi tions of w ork a ssuring them of a truly fre e, dignified, and hum an existence? Not at all! If I gra nt them those condi tions and those wages, I, the capitalist, shall not gain thereby any m ore than they will. But then, why shoul d I ha ve to plague myself and be come ruined by offe ring them the profi ts of m y capital? If I w ant to work m yself as worke rs do, I w ill invest my capital somewhere else, wherever I can get the highest interest, and w ill offe r my labor for s ale to some capitalist just as my worke rs do. If, profi ting by t he pow erful initiative afforde d me by m y capital, I ask those hundre d worke rs to fertilize that capital with their labor, i t is not because of m y sympathy for t heir sufferings, nor because of a spirit of justice, nor be cause of love for hum anity. The capitalists are by no m eans philanthropi sts; they would be ruined if they pra cticed phi lanthropy. It is because I hope to dra w from the labor of t he worke rs sufficient profi t to be able to live comfortably, even richly, while at the same time increasing m y capital - and all that without having to work m yself. Of course I shall work t oo, but my work w ill be of a n altogether different kind and I w ill be remunerated at a much higher rate than the worke rs. It will not be the work of produc tion but that of a dministration and exploitation. But isn't administrative work a lso produc tive work? No doubt it is, for l acking a good a nd an intelligent administration, m anual labor w ill not produc e anything or i t will produc e very little and very ba dly. But from the point of vi ew of justice and the needs of produc tion itself, it is not at all"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"necessary that this work s houl d be monopol ized in my hands, nor, a bove all, that I shoul d be compensated at a rate so much higher than manual labor. T he co-ope rative associations already have prove n that worke rs are quite capable of a dministering indus trial enterprises, that it can be done by w orke rs elected from their midst and w ho re ceive the same wage. Therefore if I concentrate in my hands the administrative pow er, it is not because the interests of produc tion demand it, but in orde r to serve my ow n ends, the ends of e xploitation. A s the absolute boss of m y establishment I ge t for m y labor t en or t wenty times more than my worke rs get for t heirs, and this is true despite the fact that my labor i s incomparably less painful than theirs. But the capitalist, the business owner, runs risks, they say, while the worke r risks nothing. T his is not true, because when seen from his side, all the disadvantages are on t he part of the worke r. The business owner can conduc t his affairs poorl y, he can be wiped out in a bad deal, or be a victim of a commercial crisis, or by a n unfore seen catastrophe ; in a word he can rui n himself. This is true. But does ruin mean from the bourge ois point of vi ew to be reduced to the same level of m isery as those who di e of hunge r, or t o be forc ed among t he ranks of the common labore rs? This so rarely happens, that we might as well say never. Afterwards it is rare that the capitalist does not retain something, de spite the appearance of rui n. Nowadays all bankrupt cies are more or less fraudul ent. But if absolutely not hing is saved, there are always family ties, and social relations, who, w ith help from the business skills learned which they pass to their children, pe rmit them to get positions for themselves and their children in the higher ranks of labor, i n management; to be a state func tionary, to be an executive in a commercial or indus trial business, to end up, a lthough de pendent, with an income superior to what they paid their form er worke rs. The risks of the worke r are infinitely gre ater. After all, if the establishment in which he is employed goe s bankrupt , he must go s everal days and sometimes several weeks without work, a nd for hi m it is more than rui n, it is death; because he eats everyda y what he earns. The savings of worke rs are fairy tales invented by bourge ois econom ists to lull their weak sentiment of justice, the remorse that is awakened by c hance in the bosom of their class. This ridiculous and ha teful myth will never soothe the angui sh of t he worke r. He know s the expense of satisfying the daily needs of his large family. If he had savings, he would not send hi s poor c hildren, from the age of six, to wither away, to grow weak, to be murde red phys ically and m orally in the factories, where they are forced to work ni ght and da y, a working da y of t welve and fourt een hours . If it happens sometimes that the worke r makes a small savings, it is quickly consumed by t he inevitable periods of une mploym ent which oft en cruelly interrupt his work, a s well as by t he unfore seen accidents and illnesses which befall his family. The accidents and illnesses that can overtake him constitute a risk that makes all the risks of the employer not hing in comparison: because for t he worke r debilitating illness can destroy hi s produc tive ability, hi s labor pow er. Over all, prol onge d illness is the most terrible bankrupt cy, a bankrupt cy that means for hi m and hi s children, hunge r and de ath. I know full well that unde r these condi tions that if I w ere a capitalist, who ne eds a hundre d worke rs to fertilize my capital, that on e mploying these worke rs, all the advantages are for m e, all the disadvantages for t hem. I propos e nothing m ore nor l ess than to exploit them, and if you w ish me to be sincere about it, and prom ise to gua rd m e well, I w ill tell them: \"Look, m y children, I ha ve some capital which by i tself cannot produc e anything, be cause a dead thing cannot produc e anything. I ha ve nothing produc tive without labor. A s it goes, I cannot benefit from consuming it unproduc tively, since having consumed it, I w ould be left with not hing. But thanks to the social and pol itical institutions which rul e over us and are all in my favor, i n the existing econom y my capital is suppos ed to be a produc er as well: it earns me interest. From whom this interest must be taken - a nd it must be from someone, since in reality by i tself it produc es absolutely not hing - t his does not concern you. It is enough for you t o know that it renders interest. Alone this interest is insufficient to cover my expenses. I am not an ordi nary m an as you. I c annot be, nor do I w ant to be, content with little. I w ant to live, to inhabit a beautiful hous e, to eat and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"drink w ell, to ride in a carriage, to maintain a good a ppearance, in short, to have all the good t hings in life. I also want to give a good e ducation to my children, to make them into gentlemen, and send them away to study, a nd afterwards, having be come much more educated than you, t hey can dom inate you one day as I dom inate you t oday. And as education alone is not enough, I w ant to give them a grand inheritance, so that divided between them they will be left almost as rich as I. Cons equently, be sides all the good t hings in life I want to give myself, I a lso want to increase my capital. How will I achieve this goal? Armed with this capital I propos e to exploit you, a nd I propos e that you pe rmit me to exploit you. Y ou w ill work a nd I w ill collect and appropri ate and sell for m y ow n behalf the produc t of your l abor, w ithout giving you m ore than a port ion w hich is absolutely necessary to keep you from dying of hunge r today, so that at the end of t omorrow you will still work for m e in the same condi tions; and w hen you ha ve been exhausted, I w ill throw you out, and re place you w ith others. Know it well, I w ill pay you a salary as small, and impose on you a working da y as long, w orking condi tions as severe, as despotic, as harsh as possible; not from wickedness - not from a motive of ha tred towards you, nor a n intent to do you ha rm - but from the love of w ealth and to get rich qui ck; because the less I pa y you a nd the more you w ork, t he more I will gain.\" This is what is said implicitly by e very capitalist, every indus trialist, every bus iness owner, every employer who de mands the labor pow er of t he worke rs they hire. But since suppl y and de mand are equal, why do t he worke rs accept the condi tions laid dow n by the employer? If the capitalist stands in just as great a need of e mploying the worke rs as the one hundre d worke rs do of be ing employed by hi m, doe s it not follow that both sides are in an equal position? Do not both meet at the market as two equal merchants - from the juridical point of vi ew at least - one bringing a commodity called a daily wage, to be exchanged for t he daily labor of t he worke r on t he basis of so many hours per day; and the other bringing hi s own labor a s his commodity to be exchanged for t he wage offe red by t he capitalist? Since, in our s uppos ition, t he demand is for a hundre d worke rs and the suppl y is likewise that of a hundre d persons, it may seem that both sides are in an equal position. Of course nothing of t he kind is true. What is it that brings the capitalist to the market? It is the urge to get rich, to increase his capital, to gra tify hi s ambitions and social vanities, to be able to indul ge in all conceivable pleasures. And w hat brings the worke r to the market? Hunge r, the necessity of e ating today and tomorrow . Thus, while being equal from the point of juridical fiction, the capitalist and the worke r are anything but equal from the point of vi ew of the econom ic situation, w hich is the real situation. T he capitalist is not threatened with hunge r when he comes to the market; he know s very w ell that if he does not find today the worke rs for w hom he is looki ng, he will still have enough t o eat for qui te a long t ime, owing to the capital of w hich he is the happy possessor. If t he worke rs whom he meets in the market present demands which seem excessive to him, because, far from enabling hi m to increase his wealth and improve even more his econom ic position, t hose propos als and condi tions might, I do not say equalize, but bring the econom ic position of t he worke rs somewhat close to his own - w hat does he do i n that case? He turns dow n those propos als and w aits. After all, he was not impelled by a n urge nt necessity, but by a desire to improve his position, w hich, compared to that of the worke rs, is already qui te comfortable, and so he can wait. And he will wait, for hi s business experience has taught him that the resistance of worke rs who, pos sessing ne ither capital, nor c omfort, nor a ny savings to speak of, a re pressed by a relentless necessity, by hunge r, that this resistance cannot last very long, a nd that finally he will be able to find the hundre d worke rs for w hom he is looki ng - for t hey will be forc ed to accept the condi tions which he finds it profi table to impose upon t hem. If they refuse, others will come who will be only too ha ppy t o accept such condi tions. That is how things are done daily with the know ledge and in ful l view of e veryone . If, a s a consequence of the particular circumstances that constantly influence the market, the branch of i ndus try in which he planned at first to employ hi s capital does not offe r all the advantages that he had hope d, then he will shift his capital elsewhere; thus the bourge ois capitalist"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"is not tied by na ture to any specific indus try, but tends to invest (as it is called by t he econom ists - exploit is what we say) indifferently in all possible indus tries. Let's suppos e, finally, that learning of some indus trial incapacity or m isfortune, he decides not to invest in any indus try; well, he will buy stocks and annui ties; and if the interest and di vidends seem insufficient, then he will engage in some occupation, or s hall we say, sell his labor for a time, but in condi tions much more lucrative than he had offe red to his own worke rs. The capitalist then comes to the market in the capacity, if not of a n absolutely fre e agent, at least that of a n infinitely fre er agent than the worke r. W hat happens in the market is a meeting be tween a drive for l ucre and starvation, be tween master and slave. Juridically they are both equal; but econom ically the worke r is the serf of t he capitalist, even before the market transaction ha s been concluded whereby the worke r sells his person and hi s liberty for a given time. The worke r is in the position of a serf be cause this terrible threat of starvation w hich daily hangs over his head and ove r his family, will forc e him to accept any condi tions imposed by t he gainful calculations of the capitalist, the indus trialist, the employer. And onc e the contract has been negotiated, the serfdom of the worke rs is doubl y increased; or to put it better, be fore the contract has been negotiated, goa ded by hunge r, he is only pot entially a serf; after it is negotiated he becomes a serf in fact. Because what merchandise has he sold to his employer? It is his labor, hi s personal services, the produc tive forc es of hi s body, m ind, a nd spirit that are found i n him and are inseparable from his person - i t is therefore himself. From then on, t he employer will watch ove r him, either directly or by m eans of ove rseers; everyda y duri ng w orking hours and unde r controlled condi tions, the employer will be the owner of hi s actions and movements. When he is told: \"Do this,\" the worke r is obligated to do i t; or he is told: \"Go there,\" he must go. Is this not what is called a serf? M. Karl Marx, the illustrious leader of G erman Com munism, justly obs erved in his magnificent work D as Kapital2 that if the contract freely entered into by t he vendors of m oney -in the form of wages - and the vendors of their ow n labor -t hat is, between the employer and the worke rs - were concluded not for a definite and limited term only, but for one 's whole life, it would constitute real slavery. Conc luded for a term only and re serving to the worke r the right to qui t his employer, this contract constitutes a sort of vol untary and transitory s erfdom . Yes, transitory a nd vol untary from the juridical point of vi ew, but now ise from the point of vi ew of e conom ic possibility. The worke r always has the right to leave his employer, but has he the means to do s o? And if he does quit him, is it in orde r to lead a free existence, in which he will have no m aster but himself? No, he does it in orde r to sell himself to another employer. He is driven to it by t he same hunge r which forc ed him to sell himself to the first employer. Thus the worke r's liberty, so much exalted by t he econom ists, jurists, and bourge ois republ icans, is only a theoretical freedom , lacking any m eans for i ts possible realization, a nd consequently it is only a fictitious liberty, an utter falsehood. T he truth is that the whole life of the worke r is simply a continuous and di smaying succession of t erms of serfdom -voluntary from the juridical point of vi ew but compulsory i n the econom ic sense - broke n up by momentarily bri ef interludes of fre edom accompanied by s tarvation; in other words, it is real slavery. This slavery m anifests itself daily in all kinds of w ays. Apart from the vexations and oppre ssive condi tions of the contract which turn t he worke r into a subordi nate, a passive and obe dient servant, and the employer into a nearly absolute master - apart from all that, it is well know n that there is hardly an indus trial enterprise wherein the owner, impelled on t he one hand by t he two-fol d instinct of an una ppeasable lust for profi ts and absolute pow er, and on t he other hand, profi ting by t he econom ic dependence of the worke r, doe s not set aside the terms stipulated in the contract and wring some additional concessions in his own favor. N ow he will demand m ore hours of w ork, t hat is, ove r and above those stipulated in the contract; now he will cut dow n wages on s ome pretext; now he will impose arbitrary fines, or he will treat the worke rs harshly, rude ly, and insolently. But, one may say, in that case the worke r can qui t. Easier said than done . At times the worke r"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"receives part of hi s wages in advance, or hi s wife or c hildren may be sick, or pe rhaps his work i s poorl y paid throughout this particular indus try.

N ot having to hand the works mentioned, I t ook t hese quot es from la Histoire de la Revolution de 1848, by L ouis Blanc. Mr. Bl anc continues with these words: \"We have been well alerted. Now we know , without room for doubt , that according to all the doctrines of the old pol itical econom y, wages cannot have any ot her basis than the regulation be tween suppl y and de mand, a lthough t he result is that the remuneration of l abor i s reduced to what is strictly necessary to not perish by starvation.

D as Kapital, Kritik der pol itischen Oekonom ie, by K arl Marx; Erster Band. T his work w ill need to be translated into French, be cause nothing, t hat I know of, c ontains an analysis so profound, so luminous , so scientific, so decisive, and if I can expre ss it thus, so merciless an expos e of the form ation of bourge ois capital and the systematic and cruel exploitation that capital continues exercising ove r the work of t he prol etariat. The only defect of this work... pos itivist in direction, based on a profound s tudy of e conom ic works, without admitting any logic other than the logic of the facts - the only defect, say, is that it has been written, in part, but only in part, in a style excessively metaphys ical and abstract... which makes it difficult to explain and ne arly unapproa chable for t he majority of w orke rs, and it is principally the worke rs who m ust read it nevertheless. The bourge ois will never read it or, i f they read it, they will never want to comprehend it, and if they comprehend it they will never say anything about it; this work be ing not hing ot her than a sentence of de ath, scientifically motivated and irrevocably pronounc ed, not against them as individuals, but against their class.
