Who a re the real idealists -- the idealists not of abstraction, but of life, not of heaven,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"but of earth -- and w ho a re the materialists? It is evident that the essential condi tion of theoretical or divine idealism is the sacrifice of logic, of hum an reason, t he renunc iation of science. W e see, further, that in de fending t he doc trines of idealism one finds hi mself enlisted pe rforce in the ranks of the oppr essor s and e xploiters of the masses. The se are two gr eat reasons w hich, it would se em, shoul d be suf ficient to dr ive every gr eat mind, e very gr eat heart, from idealism.

No m ore can it be persona l interests, si nce these men are infinitely above everything of that sor t. It must, then, be a pow erful moral motive. W hich? The re can be but one . The se illustrious m en think, no doubt , that idealistic theories or beliefs are essentially necessary to the moral dignity and gr ande ur of man, a nd t hat materialistic theories, on the contrary, reduc e him to the level of the beasts. And i f the truth w ere just the opposi te! Eve ry de velopm ent, I have said, implies the negation of its poi nt of departure. The basis or poi nt of departure, according t o the materialistic school , be ing m aterial, the negation m ust be necessarily ideal. Starting f rom the totality of the real world, or from what is abstractly called m atter, it logically arrives at the real idealisation - - that is, a t the hum anisation, a t the full and c omplete emancipation of soc iety. Per contra and f or the same reason, t he basis and poi nt of departure of the idealistic school being ideal, it arrives ne cessarily at the materialisation of soc iety, a t the organization of a brutal despot ism and a n iniquitous a nd i gnobl e exploitation, unde r the form of Church and S tate. The historical developm ent of man according t o the materialistic school , is a progr essive ascension; in the idealistic syst em it can be not hing but a continuous f all. Whatever hum an que stion w e may de sire to consi der, we always f ind t his sa me essential contradiction be tween the two sc hool s. Thus, a s I have already obse rved, materialism starts from animality to establish hum anity; idealism starts from divinity to establish sl avery and c onde mn the masses to an endless a nimality. Ma terialism denies free will and e nds i n the establishm ent of liberty; idealism, in the name of hum an di gnity, pr oclaims free will, and on t he ruins of every liberty founds a uthor ity. Ma terialism rejects the principle of authority, be cause it rightly consi ders it as the corollary of animality, a nd be cause, on t he contrary, the triumph of hum anity, the object and c hief significance of history, c an be realised onl y through l iberty.

The difficult step in the historical developm ent of this terrible religious i nsanity w hich continue s to obse ss a nd c rush us was to posi t a divine world as suc h, out side the world.

V ery num erous, they ne cessarily retained a more or less m aterial character, or, rather, they w ere so num erous be cause they w ere material, diversity be ing one of the principal attributes of the real world. The pagan gods w ere not yet strictly the negation of real things; they w ere onl y a fantastic exagge ration of them. We have seen how much this transition c ost the Jewish pe ople, const ituting, so t o spe ak, its entire history.

To- day it is no l onge r difficult to unde rstand how the divine ideas w ere bor n, how they w ere created in suc cession by t he abstractive faculty of man. Ma n m ade the gods. B ut in the time of Plato this know ledge was impossi ble. The collective mind, and c onse que ntly the individua l mind a s w ell, even that of the greatest genius, w as not ripe for that.

He was the first to study, l ike the analyst and e xpe rimenter that he was, logic, the laws of hum an thought , and a t the same time the physi cal world, not in its ideal, illusor y essence, but in its real aspect. After him the Greeks of Alexandr ia establishe d the first school of the posi tive scientists. The y w ere atheists. B ut their atheism left no m ark on t heir contempor aries.

After Plato, di vine ideas w ere rejected in m etaphysi cs themselves; this w as done by t he Epi cureans a nd S ceptics, two se cts w ho c ontributed m uch to the degradation of hum an aristocracy, but they ha d no e ffect upon t he masses. Another school , infinitely m ore influential, was formed at Alexandria. Thi s w as the school of neo-Platonists. The se, conf oundi ng i n an impure mixture the monst rous imaginations of the Orient with the ideas of Plato, w ere the true originators, a nd l ater the elaborators, of the Christian dogm as. Thus t he persona l and gr oss e goism of Jehova h, the not less br utal and gr oss R oman conque st, and t he metaphysi cal ideal spe culation of the Greeks, m aterialised by contact with the Orient, were the three historical elements w hich m ade up t he spiritualistic religion of the Christians.

It is, then, e stablished that the profe ssors of t he Chri stian vi rtues, cons ecrated by t he Churc h, the pri ests, in the immense majority of cases, have pra ctised qui te the contrary of w hat they ha ve preached.

T he pos ition of t he Chri stian pri est invol ves a doubl e contradiction. In the first place, that between the doc trine of a bstinence and re nunc iation a nd t he pos itive tende ncies and ne eds of hum an na ture -- t ende ncies and ne eds which, in some individua l cases, always very rare, may inde ed be continua lly he ld ba ck, s uppre ssed, a nd e ven entirely annihilated by t he cons tant influence of s ome pot ent intellectual and m oral passion; which at certain m oments of c ollective exaltation, m ay be forgot ten and ne glected for s ome time by a large mass of m en at onc e; but which are so funda mentally inhe rent in our na ture that soone r or l ater they always resume their rights: so that, when they are not satisfied in a regular and norm al way, they are always replaced at last by unw holesome and m ons trous satisfaction. T his is a natural and c ons eque ntly fa tal and i rresistible law, unde r the disastrous action of w hich inevitably fa ll all Chri stian pri ests and e specially thos e of the Rom an Ca tholic Churc h. It cannot apply to the profe ssors, that is to the pri ests of t he mode rn Churc h, unl ess they are also obl iged to pre ach Chri stian abstinence and re nunc iation. But there is another contradiction c ommon t o the pri ests of bot h sects. This contradiction grow s out of t he very t itle and pos ition of m aster. A master who c ommands , oppre sses, and e xploits is a wholly logical and qui te natural persona ge. But a master who s acrifices himself to thos e who a re subordi nated to hi m by hi s divine or hum an pri vilege is a contradictory a nd qui te impos sible being. This is the very c ons titution of hypoc risy, s o w ell personified by t he Pope , who, w hile calling himself the lowe st servant of the servants of God -- i n toke n w hereof, fol lowing t he example of Chri st, he even w ashes onc e a year the feet of t welve Rom an be gga rs -- proc laims himself at the same time vicar of G od, a bsolute and i nfallible master of t he world.
