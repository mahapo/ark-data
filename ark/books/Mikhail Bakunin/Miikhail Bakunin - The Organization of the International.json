[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"T h e O r gan i z at i on of t h e In t e r n at i on al ( 1869) b y M i c h ae l B ak u n i n The masses are the social pow er, or, a t least, the essence of t hat pow er. But they lack two things in orde r to fre e themselves from the hateful condi tions which oppre ss them: educ ation, a nd orga nization. T hese two things represent: toda y, the real founda tions of pow er of a ll gove rnm ent. To abolish the military a nd gove rning pow er of t he State, the prol etariat must orga nize. But since orga nization c annot exist without know ledge , it is necessary t o spread among t he masses real social educ ation. To spread this real social educ ation i s the aim of t he Int ernationa l. Cons eque ntly, the day on w hich the internationa l succeeds in uni ting i n its ranks a half, a fourt h, or e ven a tenth pa rt of t he worke rs of E urope , the State or S tates will cease to exist. The orga nization of t he Int ernationa l will be altoge ther di fferent from the orga nization of t he State, since its aim is not to create new States but to destroy a ll existing gove rnm ent systems. The more artificial, brut al, and a uthori tarian is the pow er of t he State, the more indifferent and hos tile it is to the natural developm ents, interests and de sires of t he people, the fre er and m ore natural must be the orga nization of t he Int ernationa l. It must try a ll the more to accommoda te itself to the natural instincts and i deals of t he people. But what do w e mean by t he natural orga nization of t he masses? We mean the orga nization w hich is founde d upon t he expe rience and re sults of t heir everyda y life and t he difference of t heir occupa tions , i.e., their indus trial orga nization. T he moment all bra nches of i ndus try a re represented in their Int ernationa l, the orga nization of t he masses will be complete. But it might be said that, since we exist, the Int ernationa l, orga nized influence ove r the masses: we are aiming a t new pow er equa lly w ith the pol iticians of t he old State systems. This change is a gre at mistake. The influences of t he Int ernationa l ove r the masses differs from all gove rnm ent pow er in that, it is no m ore than a natural, unoffi cial influence of ordi nary i deas, without authori ty. The State is the authori ty, the rul e, and orga nized pow er of t he pos sessing c lass, and t he make- believe expe rts ove r the life and l iberty of m asses. The State doe s not want anything ot her than the servility of t he masses. At onc e it demands their subm ission. The Int ernationa l, on t he other ha nd, ha s no ot her obj ect then the absolute fre edom of t he masses. Cons eque ntly, it appe als to the rebel instinct. In orde r that this rebel instinct shoul d be strong a nd pow erful enough t o ove rthrow the rul e of t he State and t he pri vileged class, the Int ernationa l must orga nize. To re alize this goa l, it has to employ t wo qui te just weapons : 1. T he propa gation of i ts ideas. 2. T he natural orga nization of i ts pow er or a uthori ty, through t he influence of i ts adhe rents on t he masses. A person w ho c an assert that, orga nized activity is an attack on t ine fre edom of t he masses, or a n attempt to create a new rul e, is either a sophi st or a fool . It is sad enough for t hese who don' t know the rul es of hum an solidarity, to think t hat complete individua l inde pende nce is pos sible, or desirable. Such a condi tion w ould m ean the dissolution of a ll hum an society, s ince the entire social existence of m an de pends on t he interdepende nce of i ndividua ls and t he masses. Every pe rson, e ven the cleverest and s tronge st-nay, e specially the clever and s trong--a re at all times, the creatures as also the creators of t his influence. The fre edom of e ach individua l is the direct out come of t hese"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"material mental and m oral influences, of a ll individua ls surroundi ng hi m in that society in w hich he lives, de velops , and di es. A person w ho s eeks to fre e himself from that influence in the name of a metaphys ical, supe rhum an, a nd pe rfectly egotistical \"fre edom \" aims at his ow n extermination a s a hum an be ing. A nd t hese who re fuse to us e that influence on ot hers, withdra w from all activity of social life, and by not passing on t heir thought s and fe elings , work for t heir ow n de struction. Therefore , this so-called \"i nde pende nce,\" w hich is pre ached so oft en by t he idealists and metaphys icians: this so-called individua l liberty is onl y the destruction of e xistence. In na ture, as well as in hum an society, w hich is never anything e lse than pa rt of t hat same nature, every c reature exists on c ondi tion t hat he tries, as much as his individua lity w ill permit, to influence the lives of ot hers. The destruction of t hat indirect influence would m ean de ath. A nd w hen w e desire the fre edom of t he masses, we by no m eans want to de stroy t his natural influence, which individua ls or groups of i ndividua ls, create through t heir ow n contract. What we seek is the abolition of t he artificial, pri vileged, lawful, and offi cial influence. If t he Churc h and S tate wore pri vate institutions , we shoul d be , even then, I s uppos e their oppone nts. W e shoul d not have prot ested against their right to exist. True, in a sense, they are, toda y, pri vate institutions , as they exit exclusively to cons erve the interests of t he pri vileged classes. Still, we oppos e them, be cause they us e all the pow er of t he masses to forc e their rul e upon t he latter in an authori tarian, offi cial, and brut al manne r. If t he Int ernationa l could ha ve orga nized itself in the State manne r, w e, its most enthus iastic friends , would ha ve become its bitterest enemies. But it cannot pos sibly orga nize itself in such a form . The Int ernationa l cannot recogni ze limits to hum an fellowship and, w hilst the State cannot exist unl ess it limits, by t erritorial pre tensions , such fellowship and e qua lity, H istory ha s show n us that the realization of a league of a ll the States of t he world, a bout which all the despots have dre amt, is impos sible. Hence these who s peak of t he State, necessarily think a nd s peak of a world di vided into di fferent States, who a re internally oppre ssors and out wardly de spoilers, i.e., enemies to each ot her. T he State, since it invol ves this division, oppre ssion, a nd de spoliation of hum anity, m ust represent the negation of hum anity and t he destruction of hum an society. There would not have been any s ense in the orga nization of t he worke rs at al!, if they ha d not aimed at the ove rthrow of t he State. The Int ernationa l orga nizes the masses with this obj ect in vi ew, to the end t hat they m ight recall this goa l. And how doe s it orga nize them? Not from the top t o the bot tom, by i mpos ing a seeming uni ty and orde r on hum an society, a s the state attempts, without regards to the differences of i nterest arising from differences of oc cupa tion. On the contrary, t he Int ernationa l orga nizes the masses from the bot tom up w ards, taking t he social life of t he masses, their re al aspirations as a starting poi nt, and e ncoura ging t hem to uni te in groups accordi ng t o their re al interests in society. T he Int ernationa l evolves a uni ty of purpos e and c reates a real equilibrium of a im and w ell-being out of t heir na tural difference in life and oc cupa tion. Just because the Int ernationa l is orga nized in this way, it develops a real pow er. H ence it is essential that every m ember of e very group s houl d be acqua inted thoroughl y w ith all its pri nciples. Only by these means will he make a good propa gandist in time of pe ace and re al revolutionist in time of war. We all know that our progra m is just. It expre sses in a few nobl e words the just and hum ane demands of t he prol etariat. Just because it is an absolutely hum ane progra m, it contains all the symptoms of t he social revolution. It proc laims the destruction of t he old and t he creation of t he new world. This is the main poi nt which w e must explain to all members of t he Int ernationa l. This progra m subs titutes a new science, a new phi losophy for t he old re ligion. A nd i t defines a new internationa l policy, in pl ace of t he old di plomacy. It has no ot her obj ect than the ove rthrow of t he States. In orde r that the members of t he Int ernationa l scientifically fi ll their pos ts, as revolutiona ry propa gandists, it is necessary for e very one to be imbue d w ith the new science, phi losophy, a nd"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"policy: the new spirit of t he Int ernationa l.

It might be answered that not all worke rs, even w hen they are members of t he Int ernationa l, can be educ ated. It is not enough, t hen, that there are in the orga nization, a group of pe ople, who--a s far as pos sible--re acqua inted w ith the science, phi losophy, a nd pol icy of S ocialism? Ca nnot the wide mass fol low their \"brot herly advice \"not to turn from the right path, that leads ultimately to the freedom of t he prol etariat?

The educ ated and c apable minori ty w ould, toge ther with its respons ibilities, de mand t he rights of a gove rning body.

The Int ernationa l onl y then can be come a weapon for l iberating t he people, when it fre es itself; when it doe s not permit itself to be divided into two groups --a big m ajority, the blind t ool of a n educ ated m inori ty.
