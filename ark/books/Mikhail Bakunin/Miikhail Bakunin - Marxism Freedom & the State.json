The pol icy of Bi smarck i s that of t he pre sent; the pol icy of M arx, w ho c ons iders hi mself a t least as his successor, a nd hi s cont inua tor, i s that of t he fut ure . A nd w hen I s ay t hat M arx c ons iders hi mself the cont inua tor of Bi smarck, I a m fa r from calum niating M arx. If he di d not cons ider hi mself a s such, he woul d not ha ve pe rm itted E nge ls, the confi dant of a ll hi s thought s, to w rite that Bi smarck serve s the cause of S ocial Re vol ution.

T hat is the sense in w hich he will be later, t he cont inua tor, a s to-da y he is the adm irer of t he pol icy of Bi smarck. Now let us examine the pa rticular c haracter of M arx' s pol icy, l et us ascertain t he essential poi nts on which i t is to be separated from the Bi smarckian pol icy. T he pri ncipal poi nt, and, one m ight say, t he onl y one , is this: M arx i s a de mocrat, an A uthori tarian S ocialist, and a Re publ ican; Bi smarck i s an out and out Pom eranian, a ristocratic, m ona rchical Junke r. T he di ffe rence is therefore ve ry gre at, very s erious , and bot h s ides are sincere in t his di ffe rence. O n t his poi nt, there is no pos sible unde rstandi ng or re conc iliation pos sible be tween Bi smarck a nd M arx. E ven a part from the num erous irre voc able pl edge s that M arx t hroughout hi s life, ha s gi ven t o t he cause of S ocialist democracy, hi s ve ry pos ition a nd hi s ambitions gi ve a pos itive gua rantee on t his issue. In a mona rchy, how ever L iberal it m ight be , or e ven c annot be any pl ace, any rol e for M arx, a nd s o much t he m ore so i n t he Prus sian G erm anic Empire founde d by Bi smarck, w ith a bugbe ar of a n Emperor, m ilitarist and bi got ed, a s chief a nd w ith a ll the ba rons and bure aucrats of G erm any for gua rdi ans. Be fore he can a rrive at pow er, M arx w ill ha ve to s weep a ll that away. Therefore he is forc ed t o be Re vol utiona ry. T hat is what separates M arx from Bi smarck---t he form and t he condi tions of G ove rnm ent. O ne is an out and out aristocrat and m ona rchist; and i n a Cons erva tive Re publ ic like that of F rance unde r T hiers[11], t here the ot her is an out and out democrat and re publ ican, a nd, i nto t he ba rga in, a Socialist de mocrat and a Socialist re publ ican. Let us see now what uni tes them. It is the out and out cult of t he State. I ha ve no ne ed t o prove it in the case of Bi smarck, t he proofs are there. F rom he ad t o foot he is a State's m an a nd not hing but a State's m an. But ne ither do I be lieve that I s hall ha ve ne ed of t oo gre at effort s to prove that it is the same with M arx. H e love s gove rnm ent to s uch a de gre e that he even w anted t o i nstitute one in t he Int erna tiona l W orki ngm en's Association; and he wors hips pow er so m uch t hat he wanted t o i mpos e and s till m eans to-da y t o i mpos e hi s di ctators hip on us .

This idea of a pol itical re vol ution pre ceding a social re vol ution ha s ope ned w ide the doors of t he Social Democratic Party t o a ll the Ra dical de mocrats; who a re ve ry l ittle Socialists.
