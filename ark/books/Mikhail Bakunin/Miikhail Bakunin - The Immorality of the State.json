Hence hum an liberty produc es not good but evil, m an be ing ba d by na ture . H ow did he be com e bad? That is for t heology t o e xpl ain. T he fact is that the State, w hen it came into e xistence, found man a lready i n that state and i t set for i tself the task of m aking hi m good; that is to s ay, of transform ing t he na tura l man into a citizen.

As for us , w e are ha rdl y s urpri sed a t it, for w e are convi nced that pol itics and theology a re bot h c losely re lated, s temming from the same ori gin a nd purs uing t he same aim unde r two di ffe rent na mes; we are convi nced that every S tate is a terre strial Churc h, j ust as every Churc h with its Heaven the abode of t he blessed a nd t he immort al gods - i s not hing but a celestial State. The Similarity of the Ethical Premises of Theology an d Pol itics.

And i s not this just the cont rary of w hat is now taking pl ace in our e xemplary S tates? Likewise the State pos its as a pri nciple the fol low ing t enet: In orde r to e stablish publ ic orde r it is necessary t o ha ve a supe rior a uthori ty; in orde r to gui de men a nd re pre ss their w icked pa ssions , it is necessary t o ha ve a leader, a nd a lso to impos e a curb upon t he pe opl e, but this authori ty m ust be vested in a man of vi rtuous ge nius, a legislator for hi s pe opl e, like M oses, L ycurgus , or S olon - a nd that leader and t hat curb w ill embody t he wisdom and t he repre ssive pow er of t he State. Society not a Pr oduct of a C ontract. The State is a transitory hi stori c form , a pa ssing form of s ociety - l ike the Churc h, of w hich it is a younge r brot her - but it lacks the ne cessary a nd i mmutable character of s ociety w hich is anterior t o all de velopm ent of hum anity a nd w hich, pa rtaking ful ly of t he almight y pow er of na tura l laws, acts, and m anifestations , cons titutes the ve ry ba sis of hum an e xistence. M an is born i nto s ociety just as an a nt is born i nto its ant-hi ll or a be e into its hive; man is born i nto s ociety from the ve ry m om ent that he takes his first step tow ard hum anity, from the mom ent that he be com es a hum an be ing t hat is, a be ing pos sessing t o a gre ater or l esser extent the pow er of t hought and s peech.

Revolt Against Society In conceivab le. Society a ntedates and a t the same time survi ves every hum an indi vidua l, be ing i n this respect like Nature itself. It is eterna l like Nature , or ra ther, ha ving be en born upon our e arth it will last as long as the earth. A radical revol t against society w oul d therefore be just as impos sible for m an a s a revol t against Nature , hum an s ociety be ing not hing e lse but the last gre at manifestation or c reation of N ature upon t his earth. A nd a n indi vidua l who w oul d w ant to re bel a ga inst s city that is, against Nature in ge neral and hi s ow n na ture in pa rticular - w oul d pl ace himself be yond t he pa le of re al existence, w oul d pl unge into not hingne ss, into a n a bsolute voi d, i nto lifeless abstraction, i nto G od. So it fol low s that it is just as impos sible to a sk w hether society is good or e vil as it is to a sk w hether Nature - t he uni versal, m aterial, re al, absolute, soul and s upre me be ing - i s good or e vil. It is much more than that: it is an immense, pos itive, and pri mitive fact, ha ving ha d e xistence pri or t o a ll cons cious ness, to a ll ideas, to a ll intellectual and m ora l discernm ent; it is the ve ry ba sis, it is the worl d in w hich, i nevitably a nd a t a much later stage, there be gan to de velop t hat which w e call good and e vil. The State a H istorically Necessar y Evil. It is not so w ith the State. A nd I do not he sitate to s ay that the State is an e vil but a histori cally necessary e vil, as ne cessary i n the pa st as its com plete extinction w ill be ne cessary s oone r or l ater, just as ne cessary a s pri mitive be stiality a nd t heologi cal divigations were ne cessary i n the pa st. T he State is not society; it is onl y one of i ts its histori cal form s, as brut al as it is abstract in c haracter. Histori cally, i t aros e in a ll count ries out of t he marriage of vi olence, ra pine, and pi llage - i n a word, of w ar and c onque st - w ith the Gods created in s uccession by t he theologi cal fancies of t he na tions .

Revolt Against the State. Re vol t against the State is much e asier be cause there is som ething i n the na ture of t he State which provoke s rebellion.
