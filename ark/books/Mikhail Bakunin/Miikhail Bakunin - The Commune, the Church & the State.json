I am a passionate seeker for t ruth and just as strong a n oppone nt of the corrupt ing lies, through which the party of orde r-this privileged, offi cial, and interested representative of a ll religions, philosophi cal political, legal econom ical, and s ocial outrage in the past and pre sent-has tried to ke ep the world in ignora nce. I love freedom with all my he art. It is the only condi tion unde r which the intelligence, the manliness, and ha ppiness of the people, can de velop a nd e xpand. By fre edom , how ever, I na turally unde rstand not its mere form , forc ed dow n as from above , measured and controlled by t he state, this eternal lie which in reality, is nothing but the privilege of the few founde d upon t he slavery of a ll. Nor do I m ean that \"individualistic,\" selfish, pe tty, and m ock freedom , which is propa gated by J .J. Rous seau and a ll other school s of bourge ois liberalism. The mock fre edom which is limited by t he suppos ed right of a ll, and de fended by t he state, and leads inevitably to the destruction of t he rights of the individual. No: I mean the only true freedom , that worthy of t he name; the liberty which consists therein for e veryone to de velop a ll the material, intellectual, and m oral faculties which lie dorm ant in him; the liberty which know s and re cogni zes no limitations beyond t hose which na ture decrees. In t his sense, there are no l imitations, for t he laws of our ow n na ture are not forc ed upon us by a law-giver who, be side or a bove us, sits on a throne . They are in us , the real basis of our bodi ly and intellectual existence. Ins tead of l imiting them, we must know that they are the real condi tion a nd fi rst cause of our l iberty. I mean that liberty of e ach which is not limited or re strained or c urtailed by t he liberty of a nother, but is strengthened and e nlarged through i t: the unlimited liberty of e ach through t he liberty of a ll, liberty through s olidarity, liberty in equality. (P olitical, & econom ical and s ocial.) The liberty which has conque red brut e forc e and va nqui shed the principle of a uthority, w hich is, always, onl y the expre ssion of t hat forc e. The liberty, w hich will abolish all heavenly and e arthly idols, and e rect a new world of fe llowship and hum an solidarity on t he ruins of a ll states and c hurc hes. I am a confirmed disciple of e conom ic and s ocial equality. O utside of this, I know , freedom , justice, manliness, morality, and the welfare of the individual as well as that of the community, can onl y be a hollow lie, an empty phra se. This equality must realise itself through t he free orga nisation of labour a nd the voluntary coope rative ownership of t he means of produc tion, t hrough t he combination of t he produc tive worke rs into fre ely orga nised communes, and the free federation of the communes. There must be no c ontrolling intervention of t he state. This is the point which separates, especially, the revolutionary socialists from the authoritarian i. e. marxian socialists. Bot h work for t he same end. Bot h are out to create a new society. Bot h agree that the only ba sis of this new society shall be: the orga nisation of l abour w hich each and a ll will have to pe rform unde r equal econom ic condi tions, following the demands of na ture; and the common ow nership of, e verything that is necessary to pe rform that labour, l ands, tools, machinery, etc. But , where as, the revolutionary socialists believe in the direct initiative of the worke rs themselves through t heir indus trial combinations, this is anarchist stand poi nt in contradiction to marxian or a s it claims to be scientific. The authoritarians believe in the direct initiative of the state. They imagine they can reach their goa l with the help of t he radical parties (now it shoul d be unde rstood a s communist) through t he developm ent and orga nisation of t he political pow er of t he working-c lass, especially the prol etariat of the big towns, due to concentration of l arge indus tries employing large mass of prol etariat. But the revolutionary socialists oppos e all these comprom ising and c onfus ing a lliances. They are convi nced that the goa l of a free society can onl y be reached through t he developm ent and orga nisation of t he non-pol itical, but social pow er of t he working class of bot h town and c ount ry, w ith the fusion of forge s of a ll those members of the uppe r class who a re willing to de class themselves and re ady to bre ak with the past, and to combine together for"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the same demands. The revolutionary socialists are oppos ed, therefore, to all politics. Thus we have two methods : 1) T he orga nisation of t he representative or pol itical strength of t he prol etariat for t he purpos e of capturing pol itical pow er in the state in orde r to transform society. 2) T he orga nisation of t he direct strength, the social and indus trial solidarity of t he prol etariat for the purpos e of a bolishing a ll political pow er and the state. The advoc ates of bot h methods believe in science which is out to slay superstition, a nd w hich shall take the place of re ligious churc h be lief. But the form er propos e to forc e it into hum anity, w hilst the latter seek to convi nce the people of its truth, to educate them everywhere, so that they shall voluntarily orga nise and c ombine-freely, from the bottom upw ards through i ndividual initiative and according to their true interests, but never according to a plan dra wn up be fore hand for t he \"ignora nt masses\" by a few intellectually superior pe rsons. Revolutionary-now know n as libertarian socialists believe that, in the instinctive yearnings and true wants of the masses, is to be found m uch sound re ason a nd logic than in the deep wisdom of a ll the doctors, servants, and teachers of hum anity who, a fter many di sastrous attempts, still dabble in the probl em of m aking the people happy. H umanity, think they, ha s been rul ed and gove rned much too long a nd s o they think this state of the affairs shoul d continue. Inde ed the sourc e of pe ople's troubl e, lies not in this or that form of gove rnment, but in the existence and m anifestation of G overnment itself, whatever form it may assume. This is the historical difference between the authoritarian communist ideas, scientifically de veloped through t he German M arxist school and pa rtly adopt ed by E nglish and A merican Socialists, on one hand a nd the Anarchist ideas of J oseph P ierre Proudhon w hich ha ve educated the prol etariat of the Latin count ries and led them intellectually to the last consequences of P roudhon' s teachings This latter revolutionary or l ibertarian socialism has now for t he first time, attempted to put its ideas into practice in the Paris Com mune. I am a follower of t he Paris Com mune, which, though da stardly murde red and drow ned in blood by the assassins of the clerical and m onarchial reaction, ye t lives, more than ever, in the imagination and he arts of the Europe an prol etariat. I am its follower, especially be cause of the feet that it was a coura geous, determined, ne gation of t he state. It is a fact of e norm ous significance, that this shoul d have happened in France, hitherto the land of s tronge st political centralisation; that it was Paris, the head and c reator of t his great centralisation, w hich made the start- thus destroying itself and proc laiming w ith joy its fall, in orde r to give life to France, to Europe , to the whole world; thus revealing to all enslaved pe ople-and w ho a re the people who a re not slaves-the only way to liberty and ha ppiness; delivering a deathly stroke against the political traditions of bourge ois liberalism, and gi ving a sound ba sis to revolutionary socialism. Paris thus earned for i tself the curses of the reactionaries of F rance and E urope . It inaugura ted the new era, that of the final and e ntire liberation of t he people,and their truly realised solidarity, above and in spite of a ll limitations of the State. Proclaimed the religion of hum anity. M ade manifest its hum anism and a theism, and s ubstituted the great truths of s ocial life and s cience for godl y lies. Paris, heroic, sane, unfl inching, a sserted its strong be lief in the future of hum anity. It substituted liberty, justice, and fra ternity for t he falsehood a nd injustice of re ligious and pol itical morality. Paris, choke d in the blood of i ts children, symbolised hum anity crucified by t he international united reaction of E urope at the direct inspiration of t he churc hes and the high pri ests (Politicians) of injustice. The next international uphe aval of hum anity will be the resurrection of P aris. Such is the true meaning a nd the beneficial and immeasurably important results of the two-months' existence and m emorable fall of the Paris Com mune. It lasted onl y a short time. It was hampered too m uch by t he deadly war it had to wage against the Versailles reaction a nd H oly Alliance. Cons equently, it was una ble to work out its Socialist progra mme, even theoretically, m uch less"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"practically. The majority of t he members of the Com mune, even, w ere not Socialists in the real sense of the word. A nd if they acted as Socialists, it was only be cause they were irresistibly carried away by t he nature of their surroundi ngs, the necessity of t heir pos ition, a nd not by t heir ow n innermost convi ctions. The Socialists, led by our fri end V arlin, form ed in the Com mune only a disappearingly small minority say fourt een or fi fteen members. The rest consisted of J acobins. But we must discriminate between Jacobins and J acobins. There are doc trinaire Jacobins like Gambetta whose, oppre ssing lust for pow er and form al republ icanism has lost the old revolutionary fi re, and pre served onl y a respect for c entralised uni ty and a uthority. This was the Jacobinism that betrayed the France of the people to the Prussian conque rors, and then to the native reaction. But there were hone st revolutionary Jacobins also, the last heroic decendants of the democratic impulse of 1793, m en and w omen who c ould sacrifice their centralised uni ty and w ell-armed authority to the needs of the revolution ra ther than be nd their conscience before the obnoxi ous reaction. In t he vangua rd of t hese great-hearted jacobins we see Delecluse, a great and nobl e figure . Before everything he desired the triumph of t he revolution; and as, without the people, no re volution is pos sible, as the people are Socialistically inclined, and c ould not be won for a ny ot her revolution than a social or e conom ic one , Delecluse and hi s fellow hone st Jacobins allowed themselves to be carried away by t he logic of the revolutionary m ovement. Without desiring it, they be came revolutionary S ocialists, and s igned proc lamations and a ppeals whose general spirit was of a decidedly Socialist nature. But, in spite of their hone sty and goodw ill, their Socialism was the produc t of e xternal circumstances rather than inner convi ction. T hey ha d ne ither the time nor t he ability to ove rcome bourge ois prejudices diametrically oppos ed to their newly acquired Socialism. This internal conflict of opi nion w eakened them in action. T hey ne ver got beyond funda mental theories, and w ere una ble to come to de cisive conclusions such as would ha ve severed their conne ction w ith bourge ois society once and for a ll. This was a great calamity for t he Com mune and for t he men themselves. It paralysed them, and they paralysed the Com mune. But we must not reproa ch them on t hat account . Man doe s not change in a day, and w e cannot change our na tures and c ustoms ove rnight. The Jacobins of the commune have show n their hone sty by s uffering themselves to be murde red for i t. Who c an expect more of them? Even the people of P aris, unde r whose influence they thought and a cted, w ere Socialists more by instinct than by w ell-balanced convi ction. A ll their yearnings were in the highest degree entirely Socialistic. But their thought s were expre ssed in traditional form s for re moved from this height. Among t he prol etariat of the French towns, and e ven of P aris, many J acobins prejudices still remain. M any fa lse ideas about the necessity of di ctatorship and gove rnment still flourish. The worship of a uthority-the inevitable result of re ligious education, t hat eternal sourc e of a ll evil, all degradation, a ll enslavement of pe oples-has not yet been entirely removed from its midst. So much is this the case that even the most intelligent sons of the people, the self-conscious Socialists of that time, have not yet been able to fre e themselves from this superstition. W ere one to dissect their minds, one would find the Jacobin, the believer in gove rnment, huddl ed together in a little corne r, forsaken and a lmost lifeless, but not quite dead. Besides, the pos ition of t he small minority of c lass conscious and re volutionary S ocialists in the Com mune was very di fficult. They felt that they lacked the support of the mass of the Paris popul ation. T he orga nisation of t he International Worke rs' Association w as very imperfect, and it only ha d a few thous and m embers. With this backing, t hey ha d to fight daily against a Jacobin majority. A nd unde r what circumstances! Daily they ha d to find w ork a nd bre ad for s everal hundre d thous and w orke rs, to orga nize and a rm them, and to gua rd against reactionary conspiracies. All in a town like Paris, beleaguered, m enaced with starvation, a nd e xpos ed to all unde rhand a ttacks of the reaction w hich ha d established itself in Versailles by ki nd pe rmission of t he Prussian Conque ror.

It is obvi ous that, unde r these circumstances, the Jacobins were the stronge r party. They were in a majority and pos sessed superior pol itical cunni ng. T heir traditions and gre ater experience in the orga nisation of gove rnment gave them a gigantic advantage ove r the few genuine Socialists. But the Jacobins took l ittle advantage of this fact; they -di d not strive to give to the upri sing of P aris a distinctive Jacobin character, but allowed themselves to dri ft into a social revolution. Many S ocialists, very consequential in their theory, re proa ch our P aris comrades with not having acted sufficiently Socialistic, whilst the barkers of the bourge ois forc es accused them of ha ving been too loyal to the Socialist progra mme. We will leave the latter gentry on one side now , and endeavour t o convi nce the stern theorists of the liberation of l abour t hat they are unjust to our P aris brethren. Be tween the best theories and their pra ctical realisation is a gigantic difference, which cannot be covered in a few days. Those of us who kne w for i nstance, our fri end V arlin-to mention only him whose death was certain-how strong, w ell considered, and de ep-root ed were the convi ctions of S ocialism in him and hi s friends. They were men whose enthusiasm, hone sty, and self-sacrifice nobody c ould doubt . Their very hone sty make them suspicious of themselves, and they unde restimated their strength and c haracter in face of the titanic labour t o which they were consecrating their life and thought . Besides, they ha d the right convi ction that, in the social revolution-w hich in this, as in every ot her respect, is the direct oppos ite of pol itical revolution-the deeds of the single leading pe rsonality ne arly disappear, and the independent, direct reaction of t he masses count as everything. T he only thing w hich the more advanced can do i s to work out , spread, and e xplain the ideas which suit the requirements and ideals of the people, and c ontribute to the national strength of t he latter by w orking unt iringly on t he task of re volutionary orga nisation- nothing m ore. Everything e lse can and m ust be accomplished by t he people themselves. Otherwise we would arrive at political dictatorship; that is, a re-instatement of the State, privilege, inequality, persecution; a re-establishment, by a long a nd rounda bout way, of pol itical, social, and e conom ic slavery. Varlin and a ll his friends; like all true Socialists, and like the average worke r who is born a nd bre d amongs t the people, experienced in highest degree this well justified fear of t he continued initiative of the same men, this distrust of the rule of di stingui shed pe rsonalities. Their upri ghtness caused them to turn t his fear and s uspicion a s much against themselves as against others. In oppos ition to the, in my opi nion, e ntirely errone ous idea of S tate Socialists, that a dictatorship or a constitutional assembly-that has emerged from a political revolution-c an proc laim and orga nise the social revolution by l aws and de grees, our P aris friends were convi nced that it could onl y be brought about and de veloped through t he independent and unc easing e ffort s of the masses and the groups . They were a thous and times right. Where is the head, how ever genial, or-i f one speaks of the collective dictatorship of a n elected assembly, even if it consists of s everal hundre d uncommonly well educated pe ople-where is the brain that is mighty and gra sping e nough t o gra sp the une nding num ber and m ultitude of true interests, yearnings, wills, and re quirements, the sum total of w hich constitute the collective will of the people? And w ho c ould invent a social orga nisation w hich would satisfy every w ant-- such an orga nisation w ould be nothing less than a torture-chamber, into which the more or less aggre ssive State would put unha ppy s ociety. This has always happened up t o now . But the social revolution m ust make an end of t his antiquated system of orga nisation. It must give back to the masses, the groups , communes, societies, even to every man and w oman, their ful l and unre stricted liberty. It must abolish, onc e and for a ll, pol itical pow er. The State must go. W ith its fall must disappear all legal rights, all the lies of va rious religions. For law and re ligion w ere always only the forge d justification for pri vilege outrages and e stablished aggre ssion."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It is clear that liberty can onl y be restored to mankind, a nd that the true interests of s ociety, of a ll groups , all local orga nisations, as well as every single, being c an be entirely satisfied entirely onl y when all States have been abolished. All the so-called \"common interests of s ociety\" w hich are suppos ed to be represented by t he State, are in reality not hing e lse than the entire and c ontinued suppre ssion of t he true interests of the districts, communes, societies, and individuals which are subservient to the State. They are an imagination, a n abstract idea, a lie. Under the guise of this idea of re presenting c ommon interests, the State becomes a vast slaught er-hous e or c emetery, w herein is slain all the living e nergy of t he people. But an abstract idea can ne ver exist for i tself and through i tself. It has no fe et with which to walk, no a rms with which to work, no s tomach in which to digest its slaught ered victims. The religious idea, God, re presents, in reality, the self-evident and re al interests of a privileged class, the clergy, who re present the earthly ha lf of t he God idea. The State, the political abstraction, re presents as real and s elf evident interests of the bourge oisie. Today, that class is the most important and pra ctically only exploiting c lass, which is threatening to swallow up a ll other classes, Priesthood i s developing gradually into a very ri ch and m ighty minority, but is rather relegated and w ith poor m ajority. The same is true of the bourge oisie. Its political and s ocial orga nisations are every da y making for a real ruling ol igarchy, t o whom a majority of m ore or less conceited and impove rished bourge ois creatures who a re obliged to serve the almighty oligarchy a s blind tools. This majority lives in a continuous illusion, a nd is, through t he irresistible pow er of e conom ic developm ent, una voidably and e ver more pulled dow n to the ranks of the prol etariat. The abolition of Churc h and S tate must be the first and e ssential condi tion for t he true liberation of society. O nly afterwards can and m ust society orga nise itself on a new basis. But not from the top dow nwards, after a more or less beautiful plan of a few experts or theorists, or on t he Strength of decrees of a ruling pow er, or t hrough a universal-suffra ge-elected Parliament. Such a proc eeding would lead inevitably to the creation of a new ruling a ristocracy, i.e., a class who ha ve nothing in common w ith the people. This class would exploit and bl eed the people unde r the presence of the common w elfare. Or in orde r to pre serve the new State. The orga nisation of t he society of t he future must and c an be accomplished onl y from the bottom upw ards, through t he free federation a nd uni on of t he worke rs into groups , uni ons, and s ocieties, which will unite again into districts, communes, national communes, and fi nally form a great international federation. O nly thus can be evolved the true vital orde r of l iberty and ha ppiness for all, the orde r which is not oppos ed to the interests of the individual or of s ociety, but on t he contrary strengthens the same and bri ngs them into ha rmony. It is said that the harmony a nd the solidarity be tween the interests of the individual and s ociety can never be effected, be cause of a n inherent antagoni sm. But if these interests never and now here did harmonise, up t o now , it has been the fault of the State in sacrificing the interests of the majority of the people to the gain of a small privileged minority. This oft-mentioned oppos ition of pe rsonal and social interests is only a swindle and pol itical lie, which ori ginated through t he religious and theological lie of the Fall-a dogm a which was invented to de grade man and de stroy hi s consciousness of hi s own va lue. Support was lent to this false idea of a ntagoni sm of interests by little speculation of t he metaphys ical philosophi es. These are closely related to theology. Metaphys ics ove r-look t he fact that man is a social animal, how ever, and vi ew society as a mechanical and w holly artificial congl omeration of i ndividuals, who s udde nly orga nise themselves on the basis of a secret or s acred compact out of their fre e will or a t the dictation of a higher pow er. Before coming together in this fashion, t hese individuals had boa sted an eternal soul and lived in alleged unl imited liberty! But when the metaphys icians, especially those who be lieve in the immortality of t he soul, assert that men, out side society, are free beings, they maintain that men can enter into society onl y by denying their fre edom and na tural independence, and s acrificing bot h their personal and local"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"interests. This denial and s acrifice of the ego be comes greater the more developed the society and the more complicated ,its orga nisation. F rom this viewpoint the State becomes the expre ssion of individual sacrifice, which all have to bri ng to its altar. In t he name of the abstract and out rageous lie called \"the common good,\" a nd \"l aw and orde r\" it imperils increasingly all personal liberty, in the interests of the gove rning c lass it exclusively represents. Hence the State appears to us as an inevitable negation a nd de struction of a ll liberty, all personal, individual, and c ommon interests. Everything in the metaphys ical and theological system follows and s olves itself. Therefore the uphol ders of these systems are obliged to exploit the masses through t he medium of Churc h and State. Whilst filling their poc kets and s atisfying a ll their filthy de sires, they tell themselves that they work for t he honour of G od, t he triumph of c ivilisation, a nd the eternal welfare of the prol etariat. But we revolutionary S ocialists, who be lieve neither in God, nor ye t in (absolute or unqua lified) free will, nor ye t in the immortality of t he soul, we say that liberty, in its fullest sense, must be the goal of hum an progre ss. Our idealistic oppone nts, the theologian and m etaphys icians, take the abstract \"liberty\" as the founda tion of t heir theories. It is then qui te easy for t hem to dra w the conclusion that slavery is the indisputable condi tion of hum an existence, who a re in our e mpirical scientific theory, m aterialists, strive in pra ctice for t he triumph of a sane and nobl e idealism. We are convi nced that the whole wealth of t he intellectual, moral and m aterial developm ent of hum anity, as well as its seeming independence, is due to the fact that man lives in society. O utside of s ociety man would not only not have been fre e. He would not even ha ve been capable of be coming a man, i. e., a self-conscious being, c apable of thought and s peech. Thinking a nd w orking together lifted man out of hi s animal condi tion. W e are absolutely convi nced that the whole life of m an is a social produc t. His interests, yearnings, needs, dre ams, and e ven his fool ishness, as well as his brut ality, injustice, and a ctions, depending, s eemingly, on fre e will, are only the inevitable results of forc es at work i n our s ocial life. Men are not independent of e ach other, but each influences the other. W e are all in continual co-relation w ith our ne ighbours and s urroundi ng na ture. In na ture itself this wonde rful co-working a nd fi tting together of e vents doe s not take place without a struggl e On the contrary, the harmony of t he elements is but the result of this continual struggl e, which is the condi tion of a ll life and of m ovement. Bot h in na ture and s ociety orde r without struggl e is the equivalent of de ath. Order is pos sible and na tural in world system only when the latter is a previously thought out arrangement imposed upon m ankind from above . The Jewish religious imagination of a godl y law- giver makes for unpa ralleled nons ense, and the negation not only of a ll orde r, but of na ture itself. '`The laws of na ture\" relate only to the goa l of na ture itself. The phra se is not true if used to mean laws decreed by a n out side authority. For these \"laws\" are nothing e lse than the continual adaptation which is part of the evolution of t hings, of t he working together of va stly different passing but real facts. The sum total of a ll action a nd interaction is what we call \"nature.\" The thought s and s cience of m an obs erve these phe nom ena, controlled and e xperimented with them and fi nally uni ted them into a system, the single parts of w hich are called \"laws.\" But nature itself know s no l aws. Nature acts unc onsciously. In i tself it demonstrates the une nding di fference of its necessarily appearing a nd self repeating phe nom ena. This is how , thanks to the inevitableness of a ctivity, the common orde r can and doe s exist. So with hum an society, w hich apparently de velops against nature, but in reality goe s hand in ha nd with the natural and inevitable developm ent of things. Only the superiority of m an ove r the rest of the animals and hi s highly de veloped thinking a bility brought a special feature into his evolution- also, by t he way, qui te natural since man, like everything e lse, is the material result of the working together and uni on of na tural forc es. This special feature is the calculating, t hinking a bility, the pow er of i nduc tion a nd a bstraction. T hrough t his man ha s been able to carry hi s thought s outside himself, and s o obs erve and c riticism himself as a thing a part, some strange or fore ign obj ect.

But this represents nothing be yond man's own ability to abstract thought , which looks dow n on a ll that is and fi nds peace in the entire negation of a ll that is. This is the very limit of the highest abstraction of t hought : this is God. Herein is to be found t he spirit and hi storical proof of e very theological and re ligious doc trine. Man did not unde rstand na ture and the material founda tion of hi s own thought s. He was unc onscious of the natural circumstances and pow ers which were characteristic of them. So he failed to realise that his abstract ideas only expre ssed his own ability to abstract thought .

But it became necessary to imagine more clearly and to make unde rstood s omehow this Goal, this supre me nothingne ss which seemed to contain all things in essence but not in fact. So primitive man enlarged his idea of G od. G radually he bestowed on t he deity all the pow ers which existed in hum an society, good a nd ba d, vi rtuous and vi cious. Such was the beginning of a ll religions, such their evolution from fetish worship to Chri stianity.

M an be comes more And more used to this belief. Finally it seeks to crush and to kill every effort towards any hi gher developm ent. The mad de sire to rul e or to gove rn, fi rst on t he part of a few men, then of a certain class, demanded that slavery and c onque st shoul d be accepted as the unde rlying pri nciples of s ociety. This, more than anything e lse, strengthened the terrible belief in a God a bove . Cons equently, no s ocial orde r could exist without being founde d on t he Churc h and S tate. All doc trinaires defend bot h of t hese outrageous institutions. With their developm ent increased the pow er of t he ruling c lass, of t he priests and a ristocrats. Their first concern w as to inoculate the enslaved pe oples with the idea of the necessity, the benefit, and the sacredness of Churc h and S tate. And the purpos e of a ll this was to change brut al and vi olent slavery into legal, divinely pre orda ined and s anctified slavery. Did the priests and a ristocrats really and truly be lieve in these institutions which they were endeavoring to uphol d with all their pow er, and to their ow n be nefit Or were they onl y lairs and hypoc rites? In m y opi nion the, were hone st believers and di shone st deceivers simultaneously. They themselves believe , since they pa rticipated, na turally, in the errors of the masses. Only later,at the time the old world de clined-that is, in the Middle Ages did they be come unbe lievers and shameless liars. The founde rs of s tates can be regarded also as hone st men. M an readily be lieves that which he desires and that which is not detrimental to his own interests. It makes no di fference if he is intelligent and e ducated. Through hi s egotism and hi s desire to live with his neighbours and to profi t by t heir estimation he will believe always only in that which is useful and de sirable to him. I am convi nced, for i nstance, that Thiers and the Versailles gove rnment were trying to convi nce themselves, violently, that they were saving F rance by m urde ring s everal thous and m en, w omen, and c hildren. Even if the priests, prophe ts, aristocrats, and bourge ois of a ll times were hone st believers, in spite of all, they were parasites. One cannot suppos e that they be lieved every bi t of nons ense in religion a nd politics which they taught the masses. I w ill not go s o far back as to the time when two Augurs in Rom e were una ble to look i nto each others face without smiling. It is hard to be lieve that even in the time of m ental darkne ss and s uperstition the inventors of m iracles were convi nced of t heir truth."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The same may be said of pol itics, where the motto is: \"One must unde rstand how to gove rn and rob a people so that they do not complain too m uch or forge t to be subservient, so that they ge t no chance to think of re sentment and re volt.\" How can one pos sibly be lieve after this that the men who m ake a bus iness out of pol itics, and whose goa l is injustice, violence, lies, treason, s ingle, and w holesale murde r, hone stly be lieve that the wisdom and a rt of rul ing the State make for t he common w ealth? In s pite of a ll their brut ality they are not so stupid as to think this. Churc h and S tate were in all times the school s of vi ce. History t estifies to their crimes. Ever and a lways were priest and pol itician the conscious, systematic, unyi elding, bl oodt hirsty enemies and e xecutioners of the people. But how can we reconcile two seemingly oppos ed things like cheater and c heated, liar and be liever? In thought it looks difficult, but in life we find the two oft en together. The great bulk of m ankind live in a continual qua rrel and a pathetic misunde rstanding w ith themselves, they remain unc onscious of this, as a rule, unt il some unc ommon oc currence wakes them up out of their sleep, and forc es them to reflect on t hemselves and their surroundi ngs. In pol itics, as well as in religion, m an is only a machine in the hands of hi s oppre ssors. But robbe r and robbe d, oppre ssor and oppre ssed live side by s ide, ruled by a handful of pe ople, in whom one recogni ses the real oppre ssors. It is always the same type of m en, w ho, fre e of a ll political and religious prejudice, consciously torture and oppre ss the rest of the people. In t he 17th and 18t h century, unt il the advent of the great revolution, t hey rul ed Europe and di d as they liked. They do the same today. But we have reason to hope that their rul e will be ove r soon. History t eaches us that the chief pri ests of Churc h and S tate or a lso the sworn s ervants and c reatures of these damnable institutions. Whilst consciously de ceiving the people and leading them into disaster, these persons are concerned to uphol d zealously the sanctity and una pproa chability of bot h establishments. The Churc h, on t he authority of a ll priests and m ost politicians, is essential to the prope r care of the people's souls; and the State is indispensable, in their opi nion, for t he prope r maintenance of pe ace, orde r, and justice. And the doc trinaires of a ll school s exclaim in chorus : \"Without Churc h or gove rnment progre ss and c ivilisation is impossible.\" We make no c omment on t he heavenly he reafter, since we do not believe in an immortal soul. But we are convi nced that nothing offe rs a greater menace to truth and the progre ss of hum anity than the Churc h. H ow else could it be ? Is it not the task of t he Churc h to chloroform the women and children . D oes she not kill all sound re ason e nd s cience with he r dogm as, and de grade the self- respect of m an by c onfus ing hi s ideas of ri ght and justice ? Does she not preach eternal slavery to the masses in the interest of the ruling a nd oppre ssing c lass ? And is she not determined to perpetuate the present reign of da rkne ss, ignora nce, misery, a nd c rime ? For the progre ss of our a ge not to be an empty dre am, it must first sweep the Churc h out of its path."}]
