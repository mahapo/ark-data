Anarchists, he insists, must seek equality and, therefore, integral education same education available for e veryone . ' It is to the interest of bot h labour a nd science there must no longer be this division into workers and scholars - henceforth there must only be men. The first topic for c onsideration today is this will it be feasible for the working m asses to know complete emancipation as long a s the education available to those masses continues to be inferior to that bestowed upon t he bourge ois, or, i n more general terms, as long a s there exists any class, be it numerous or ot herwise, which, by vi rtue of bi rth, is entitled to a superior education and a more complete instruction? Does not the question answer itself? Is it not self-evident that of any two persons endow ed by na ture with roughl y equivalent intelligence, one will have the edge - the one whose mind will have been broa dened by l earning and who, ha ving the better grasped the inter- relationships of na tural and social phenomena (what we might term the laws of na ture and of society) will the more readily and m ore fully gra sp the nature of hi s surroundi ngs? And that this one will feel, let us say, a greater liberty and, in pra ctical terms, show a greater aptitude and capability than his fellow? It is natural that he who know s more will dom inate him who know s less. And were this disparity of e ducation and education and learning the only one to exist between two classes, would not all the others swiftly follow until the world of m en itself in its present circumstances, that is, until it was again divided into a mass of slaves and a tiny num ber of rul ers, the form er labouri ng away as they do t oday, to the advantage of the latter? Now we see why the bourge ois socialists demand onl y a little education for t he people, a soupcon more than they currently receive; whereas we socialist democrats demand, on t he people's behalf, complete and integral education, an education as full as the power of intellect today permits, So that, henceforth, there may not be any class over the workers by vi rtue of superior education and therefore able to dom inate and exploit them. The bourge ois socialists want to see the retention of the class system each class, they contend, ful filling a specific social func tion; one specialising, say, in learning, and the other in manual labour. W e, on t he other hand, seek the final and the utter abolition of c lasses; we seek a unification of s ociety and equality of s ocial and econom ic provi sion for every individual on this earth. The bourge ois socialists, whilst retaining the historic bases of the society of t oday, would like to see them become less stark, less harsh and m ore prettified. Whereas we should like to see their destruction. F rom which it follows that there can be no truce or comprom ise, let alone any coalition be tween the bourge ois socialists and us socialist democrats. But, I ha ve heard it said and this is the argum ent most frequently raised against us and an argum ent which the dogm atists of every shade regard as irrefutable - it is impossible that the whole of mankind should devote itself to learning, for w e should all die of starvation. Cons equently while some study ot hers must labour s o that they can produc e what we need to live - not just produc ing for their own needs, but also for t hose men who de vote themselves exclusively to intellectual pursuits; aside from expanding the horizons of hum an know ledge, the discoveries of these intellectuals improve the condition of a ll hum an beings, without exception, w hen applied to industry, agriculture and, ge nerally, to pol itical and social life; agreed? And do not their artistic creations enhance the lives of every one of us ? No, not at all. And the greatest reproach which we can level against science and the arts is precisely"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"that they do not distribute their favours and do not exercise their influence, except upon a tiny fragment of society, to the exclusion and, thus, to the detriment of the vast majority. Today one might say of t he advances of science and of t he arts, just what has already and so prope rly been said of the prodi gious progre ss of industry, trade, credit, and, in a word, of t he wealth of s ociety in the most civilised countries of the modern world. That wealth is quite exclusive, and the tendency is for it to become more so each day, as it becomes concentrated into an ever shrinking num ber of ha nds, shunni ng the lower echelons of the middle class and the petite bourge oisie, depressing them into the proletariat, so that the grow th of t his wealth is the direct cause behind the grow ing m isery of t he labouri ng m asses. Thus the outcome is that the gulf which yawns between the privileged, contented minority and m illions of w orkers who earn their keep by t he strength of t heir arm yawns ever wider and that the happier the contented - w ho -e xploit the people's labour be come the more unha ppy t he workers become. One has only to look a t the fabulous opul ence of the aristocratic, financier, commercial and industrial clique in England and compare it with the miserable condition of t he workers of the same country; one has only to re-read the so naive and he artrending letter lately penned by a n intelligent and upri ght goldsmith of L ondon, one Walter Dugan, who ha s just voluntarily taken poi son along w ith his wife and their six children, simply as a means of escape from the degradation's of pove rty and the torments of hunge r (1) - a nd one will find one self obliged to concede that the much vaunted civilisation m eans, in material terms, to the people, only oppre ssion and rui nation. A nd the same holds true for the modern advances of science and the arts. Huge strides, indeed, it is true But the greater the advances, the more they foster intellectual servitude and thus, in material terms, foster misery and inferiority as the lot of the people; for these advances merely widen the gulf which already separates the people's level of unde rstanding from the levels of the privileged classes. From the point of vi ew of na tural capacity, the intelligence of the form er is, today, obvi ously less stunted, less exercised, less sophisticated and less corrupt ed by the need to defend unj ust interests, and is, consequently, naturally of gre ater potency than the brain power of the bourge oisie: but, then again, the brain pow er of the bourge ois does have at its disposal the complete arsenal of science filled with weapons that are indeed form idable. It is very oft en the case that a highly intelligent worker is obliged to hol d his tongue when confront ed by a learned fool who de feats him, not by di nt of intellect (of w hich he has none ) but by di nt of hi s education, an education de nied the workingman but granted the fool because, while the fool was able to develop his foolishness scientifically in schools, the working m an's labours were clothing, hous ing, fe eding him and supplying hi s every ne ed, his teachers and hi s books , everything ne cessary to his education. Even within the bourge ois class, as we know only too well, the degree of learning imparted to each individual is not the same. There, too, there is a scale which is determined, not by the potential of the individual but by the amount of w ealth of t he social stratum to which he belongs by bi rth; for example, the instruction m ade available to the children of t he lower petite bourge oisie, whilst itself scarcely superior to that which workers manage to obt ain for t hemselves, is next to not hing by comparison with the education that society makes readily available to the uppe r and m iddle bourge oisie. What, then, do w e find? The petite bourge oisie, whose only attachment to the middle class is through a ridiculous vanity on t he one hand, and its dependence upon t he big capitalists on the other, finds itself most often in circumstances even more miserable and even more hum iliating than those which afflict the proletariat. So when we talk of pri vileged classes, we never have in mind this poor pe tite bourge oisie which, if it did but have a little more spirit and gum ption, w ould not delay in joining forc es with us to combat the big and m edium bourge oisie who crush it today no less than they crush the proletariat. And should society's current econom ic trends continue in the same direction for a further ten years (which we do, how ever, regard as impossible) we may yet see the bulk of t he medium bourge oisie tumble first of all into the current circumstances of the petite bourge oisie only to slip a little later into the proletariat - as a result, of c ourse, of this inevitable concentration of ow nership into an ever smaller num ber of ha nds - the ineluctable consequences of which would be to partition society onc e and for a ll into a tiny, ove rweaningly opul ent, educated, ruling m inority and a vast majority of i mpoverished, ignora nt, enslaved prol etarians."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"There is one fact which should make an impression upon e very pe rson of c onscience, upon a ll who have at heart a concern for hum an dignity and justice; that is, for t he liberty of e ach individual amid and through a setting of e quality for a ll. That is the fact that all of the intelligentsia, all of the great applications of science to the purpos e of industry, trade and to the life of society in general have thus far profi ted no one , save the privileged classes and the power of the State, that timeless champion of a ll political and social iniquity. Never, not once, have they brought any be nefit to the masses of the people. We need onl y list the machines and every workingman and hone st advocate of the emancipation of l abour w ould accept the justice of w hat we say. By w hat power do t he privileged classes maintain themselves today, with all their insolent smugness and iniquitous pleasures, in defiance of the all too legitimate outrage felt by the masses of the people? Is it by some power inherent in their persons? No - it is solely through t he power of the State, in whose apparatus today their offs pring hol d, always, every ke y pos ition (a nd even every lower and m iddle range position) e xcepting that of soldier and worker. And in this day and age what is it that constitutes the principle unde rlying the power of the State? Why, it is science. Yes, science - Science of government, science of administration and financial science; the science of fleecing the flocks of the people without their bleating too loudly and, w hen they start to bleat, the science of urgi ng silence, patience and obe dience upon t hem by m eans of a scientifically orga nised forc e: the science of de ceiving and di viding the masses of the people and ke eping them allays in a salutary ignora nce lest they ever become able, by he lping one another and pool ing their efforts, to conjure up a power capable of ove rturning States; and, above all, military science with all its tried and tested weaponry, these form idable instruments of de struction which 'work w onders' (2): and lastly, the science of genius which has conjured up s teamships, railways and telegraphy w hich, by t urning every government into a hundre d armed, a thousand armed Bri areos (3), gi ving it the power to be, act and arrest everywhere at once - has brought about the most form idable political centralisation the world has ever witnessed. Who, then, will deny that, without exception, all of the advances made by science have thus far brought nothing, save a boos ting of t he wealth of t he privileged classes and of t he power of the State, to the detriment of the well-being and liberty of t he masses of the people, of the proletariat? But, we will hear the objection, do not the masses of the people profi t by this also? Are they not much more civilised in this society of ours than they were in the societies of bye gone centuries? We shall reply to that with an obs ervation borrow ed from the noted German socialist, Lassalle. In measuring the progre ss made by the working m asses, in terms of their political and social emancipation, one should not compare their intellectual state in this century w ith what it may have been in centuries gone by. Ins tead, one ought to consider whether, by c omparison with some given time, the gap which then existed between the working m asses and the privileged classes having been not ed, the masses have progre ssed to the same extent as these privileged classes. For, if the progre ss made by bot h has been roughl y equivalent, the intellectual gap which separates the masses from the privileged in today's world will be the same as it ever was; but if the proletariat has progre ssed furt her and m ore rapidly than the privileged, then the gap must necessarily have narrowed; but if, on t he other hand, the worker's rate of progre ss has been slower and, consequently, less than that of a representative of the ruling classes over the same period, then that gap will have grow n. The gulf which separates them will have increased and the man of pri vilege grow n more powerful and the worker's circumstances more abject, more slave like than at the date one chose as the point of de parture. If the two of us set off from two different points at the same time and you have a lead of one hundre d paces over me and you m ove at a rate of sixty paces per minute, and I a t only thirty paces per minute, then after one hour t he distance which separates us will not be just over one hundre d paces, but just over one thousand ni ne hundre d paces. That example gives a roughl y accurate notion of t he respective advances made by the bourge oisie and the proletariat. Thus far the bourge oisie has raced along t he track of c ivilisation at a quicker rate than the proletariat, not because they are intellectually more powerful than the latter indeed one might prope rly argue the contrary case - but because the political and econom ic orga nisation of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"society has been such that, hitherto, the bourge oisie alone have enjoyed access to learning and science has existed onl y for t hem, and the proletariat has found i tself doom ed to a forced ignora nce, so that if the proletariat has, nevertheless, made progre ss (and there is no de nying it has) then that progre ss was made not thanks to society, but rather in spite of it. To sum up. In s ociety as presently constituted, the advances of science have been at the root of the relative ignora nce of the proletariat, just as the progre ss of industry and commerce have been at the root of its relative impoverishment. Thus, intellectual progre ss and m aterial progre ss have contributed in equal measure towards the exacerbation of t he slavery of t he proletariat. Meaning what? Meaning that we have a duty to reject and re sist that bourge ois science, just as we have a duty to reject and re sist bourge ois wealth. And reject and re sist them in this sense - that in destroying the social orde r which turns it into the preserve of one or of s everal classes, we must lay claim to it as the common inheritance of all the world.
