The question that divides us is, whether it is crazy enough. \" Nils Bohr to Werner Heisenberg Even now, at the conclusion of this work, as I sit to write the preface to it, I am confident of partial failure. When I first completed the draft of this book, little did I know that I would be embarking on a journey of discoveries more often than not frightening and terrible in their imp lications. The odyssey was initiated by my guess that the Great Pyramid coupled and oscillated gravitational and electromagnetic energy with acoustic en ergy and a superluminal wave form called a \"pilot\" or \"scalar\" wave. In that draft, I predicted that some redundant harmonics of Planck's constant, i.e., n ear-whole number mul tiples of it, would be discovered in the very areas wher e I hypothesized such engineering and coupling would occur: the Grand Gallery, the Antechamber, the King's Chamber, and the Queen's Chamber. Shortly after completing the book and ru shing it off to a publisher, I sat down with a calculator and began crunching numbers, and within two hours had found three close multiples of Planck 's constant to within one decimal place. Excited by this discovery and my curiosity piqued, I spent the better part of two weeks crunching more num bers, and to my horrified delight, found not only the original three but se veral such redundancies right where I had originally hypothesized they would be. And not only was Planck's constant found, but the other \"Planck un its\": the Planck length and mass, so essential to the Grand Unified Theo ries and String Theory of modern theoretical physics. These results intrigued me, not only b ecause they appeared to corroborate my hypothesis that the Great Pyramid wa s some paleoancient weapon of mass destruction employing an extremely sophisticated unified physics, but also because the basis of that i"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Preface unification appeared to lie not in any theoretical mode l, but in the engineering itself. It is rare for an author to be gratef ul that a publisher rejects a manuscript, but in this instance, I was appreciative because it allowed me the opportunity to incorporate my subsequent researches into the manuscript, which is presented here. All that said, I remain confident of at least partial failure. How does one adequately describe such a complex hypothesis about such a complex and baffling subject as the Great Pyramid? How does one describe adequately the most mysterious object on earth? Or the other mysterious objects around it? Or the mysterious ge ometric and astronomical arrangement in which they are all placed? And what is a large statue of a half-man half lion doing in the middle of it all, slouchi ng to the east, gazing perpetually into space and time. And why is the Sphinx known in the Arabic tradition as \"the father of terrors?\" But I am confident of failure for yet another reason. How does one survey, with adequate technical detail, such a complex hypothesis, and yet do so for a general audience? So I must wa rn the reader, here and now, that this is not a work for the faint hearted. It does not proceed in sound bites. It does not shun technical jargon, for any attempt to understand the Great Pyramid - on any hypothesis - that presumes to do so with sound bites or without technical jargon is doomed. So what does the technical jargon of the weapon hypothesis have to say? It says that the Great Pyramid was a phase conjugate mirror and howitzer, utilizing Bohm's \"pilot wave\" as a superluminal carrier wave to accelerate cohered electromagnetic and gravito-ac oustic waves to a target via harmonic interferometry. That rather tangled idea leads to a set of putative principles of its engineering. Since so many of its dimensional measures appear to be harmonically resonant to each other, the Pyramid, as a coupled harmonic oscillator, seems constructed of several oscillators nested within the structure in such a fashion as to suggest a set of feedback loops being used to amplify that oscillated energy. ii"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star That being said, the technical jargon is there not for a technical reason, but for a \"mystical\" one, as it were. It is there, like the Pyramid itself, to initiate into a mystery. And initiation always implies some degree of mental retraining, of modifying existing con cepts by rearrang ing them in new relationships, and of reexamining and revitalizing older \"outmoded\" notions. This was, accordingly, a difficult book to arrange or to \"sequence\" properly. For example, which should be treated first? The principl es and outlines of modern theoretical physics and some of its more esoteric pursuits? Or the principles of the ancient \"paleophysi cs\" embodied in obscure ancient texts with ties to Egypt? Should one lay it out like a mathematics, physics, or engineering textbook, with every term nea tly defined, and in its precise place, and thereby risk losing the reader in a blizzard of clarit y of equations and diagrams? Or should one simply lay the terms out there and peal off the onion skins of meaning with ever more precise definitions, and thereby run the risk of losing the reader in the transparency of confusion? I chose a middle course, and consequently, chapter two, \"An Archaeology of Mass Destruction,\" and chapter three, \"The Paleography of Paleophysics\" simply discuss the evidences for a sophisticated and weaponized ancient technology, and the more abstruse notions of physics to be found in ancient texts, without much definition or clarif ication of terms. A certain degree of familiarity with contemporary physics is required, particularly with String theory and more importantly, with the much more satisfying Plasma Cosmology of Swedish physicist Hannes Alfven. In chapter four, \"De Physica Esoteri ca\" terms receive greater definition - for a more general audience - through a discussion of some of the stranger areas of contemporary th eoretical physics, includi ng some of the more startling and recent developments. Chapter five outlines in very cursory fashion the almost infinite and infi nitely astonishing mathematical and physical properties of the Pyramid. Chapter six surveys Christopher Dunn's crucially important \"machine hypothesis\" . Chapter Seven, \"Planck in the Pyramid,\" surveys the various harmonic multiples of the Planck iii"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Preface numbers found in various dimensional meas ures of the structure. In chapter eight, the whole is gathered into an exploration of the possible ways the Pyramid functioned as a weapons system of mass destruction. I have thus aimed for a \"cumulative effect\" that only begins to make sense, perhaps, in this chapter. Finally, in chapter nine, I explore various speculations of the type of society that could have bui lt such an awesome and dreadful weapon, and then actually apparently used it. I have chosen the title, The Giza Death Star, deliberately. At one level, it is an obvious resonance to Dunn's magisterial look at the machine hypothesis, The Giza Power Plant. At still another le vel, it is meant to conjure the well- known stellar alignments of the Pyramid to Orion a nd Sirius and the zodiacal associations with death that these cons tellations held for the Egyptians and for subsequent cultures. At a still deep er level, the title resonates to the appropriate images that Hollywood ha s conjured: planet busting moon-sized \"Death Stars\" from Star Wars or city -cracking electromagnetic pulse weapons from Independence Day. And that is precisely the image I wish the title to conjure, for if the physics embodied in the ancient texts is what I think it is, and if its purpose was what the ancient texts suggest it was, then it was indeed a potential planet buster without parallel in the annals of military engineering. The physics embodied in it seems to touch upon every possible well-known aspect of contemporary theory, such as Bell's non-locality theorem and the various quantum states of the electron, to mo re esoteric subjects such as phase conjugation, non-equilibrium therm odynamics, harmonic oscillators, coherence, stealth technology, the Philadelphia Experiment , Montauk and all the other \"fringe\" areas of \"pseudo-science\" that squat like black beasts in the bowels of secret governme nt research bunkers and prowl through the rumor mills of \"alternative research\" journals and books.

I have never felt anything \" good\" about it. I long held the notion that the architecture of Giza as a whole had about it the disquieting feel of a military compound. If one factored out the Sphinx for the purpose of a physical comparison, the resemblance between it and a modern military phased array radar seemed all too palpable. So when I first read the texts reproduced by Zechariah Sitchin in his The Wars of Gods and Men I experienced th at sickly sense that my worst fears might just be true. And when I read Dunn's work, those fears were confirmed, and I resolved to discover what principles, if any, might have made it work. What follows is therefore not a completed theoretical model, replete with equations and schematics and diagrams and so on. It is more like a preliminary field report, outlining re search that remains to be done... ...or is perhaps already being done. I co me away from this project with a feeling of profound disqui et that someone, somewhere, has been doing the type of \"paleophysical\" research this book implies. The litany of experimental and theoretical physicists i nvolved with such esoter ic research is known to anyone familiar with the literature. The names of Thomas Townsend Brown, Hal Puthoff, Oppenheimer, Tesla, Sagnac, von Neumann, DiPalma, Philo Farnsworth and many others fill the page s of literature th at would never be found in most physics departments or laboratories, and yet, their preoccupations are there for all to see who would bother to look. And that is the most disquieting resu lt of all. The notion that there has existed - for millennia perhaps - an unde rground or esoteric tradition of research alongside the exoteric science one learns about in universities is a radical one. It implies the existence of a body of scientific knowledge that has been deliberately manipulated and s uppressed.

Introduction: Arcanum Organon \"You shall understand (that which perhaps you will scarce think credible) that about three thousand years ago, or somewhat more, th e navigation of the world (especially for remote voyages) was greater than at this day. \" Sir Francis Bacon, The New Atlantis 1 The Great Pyramid is the most studied and surveyed building in the world, and for good reason. It is the la rgest, and most mysterious, human monument on the earth, an arcanum organon, a strange, arcane work. No other structure has so engaged the im agination nor evaded the efforts of scholars to explain. First, while it re mains true that great strides in pyramidology have been made by those outside the myopic box of the paradigms of \"orthodox history\" and \"E gyptology\" - by engineers, physicists, geologists, astronomers, investigative j ournalists, or even fundamentalists of every stripe from \"Christian\" to \"New Age\" -in the final analysis each perspective sees mostly what it has b een trained to see. Second, all these approaches seem to see in the Great Pyramid something beautiful and benignly wonderful, a triumph of geometry, astronomy, physics and engineering of some past and glorious golden age speaking its pacifistic wisdom in the mute silence of its stones down to our own time. Many have stood at the base of that massive structure and marveled, with an understandable and overwhelming awe, at the civilization that could have built such a tomb, or observatory, or machine, or \"prophecy in stone.\" I stand with them, looking up in awe and wonde r, at the massive structure, and shudder at any civilization that could have built such a weapon, such a monument 1 Sir Francis Bacon, The Advancement of Learning and the New Atlantis (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), p. 271. 1"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction: Arcanum Organon to the perversity, of mass de struction. So in that sens e, yes, I agree with the \"prophecy in stone\" hypothesis, for that civilization was far too much like our own: capable of technological wonders, capable of mass destruction, and like our own, in almost complete moral decay. In that most profound sense, the Great Pyramid is a prophecy, and a warning. This study is therefore a radical departure from previous attempts to explain the structures at Giza and thei r ultimate purpose. I do agree with some aspects of previous explanations. For example, I assume: (1) that the \"orthodox historiography \" and conventional \"Egyptological\" explanations are simply incorrect in the extreme, and therefore: (a) that the structures are the traces of some \"paleoancient\" Very High Civilization; 2 (b) that humanity is therefore of far greater antiquity than is assumed by orthodox paradigms of history; (c) that the structures embody a physics and technology of a civilization at least as advanced as our own if not much more so. (d) that insofar as the current study agrees with orthodox Egyptology's religious interpretatio n of the function of the Giza structures, it maintains that those interpretations were not original to the civilization that built th em, but were forced upon them subsequently by the legacy civilization that came ultimately to occupy them, namely ancient Egypt. Even then, as will be seen, these interpretations are partly the result of circumstances, and partly the result of a concerted e ffort and covert design on the part of that Paleoancient Very High Civilization to preserve the physical, geometric, and mathema tical knowledge - and therefore the power - embodied in the structures. 2 I use the rather redundant term \"paleoancient\" simply to designate a Civilization that once existed long before the \"ancient civilizations\" of standardized cultural history. 2"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star (2) that the various celestial, solar, and terrestrial relationships embodied in the Pyramid are really there, and thus that the Pyramid's subsidiary functions were indeed those of an astronomic and tem poral observatory and \"time capsule.\" But these were not the ultimate functions nor in tentions of its origin al builders. They did not intend to c onvey some message or \"wisdom\" or \"prophecy\" to some future age, at least, not initiall y. The ultimate purpose of these complex mathematical and physical embeddings was far from the benign astrological or prophetic vagaries later civilizations and interp reters would place upon them. They were, moreover, required by the kind of physic s that I believe made the Giza Death Star possible. Reconstruction of at least parts of that physics is the task of this study. Insofar then as I disagree with other non- orthodox interpretations, I disagree only in that the technology of the civilization that built Giza, and the use to which it was ultimately put, was far from benign. But before examining all that, we s hould first dispense with the obvious absurdity, the sheer idiocy, of the standa rd explanation of Egyptology that these massive structures - especially the Great Pyramid and its almost infinitely anomalous engineering and mathematical pr operties - are pharaonic tombs. No one is more eloquent, impassioned, nor as on target in summarizing the \"tomb\" hypothesis and its manifestly nonsensical natu re than is Peter Lemesurier, himself an exponent of the Pyramid-as-prophecy or \"time capsule\" hypothesis. But how - and why (was it built)? The logic of the thing seems to defy all analysis. And so the historians.... Know ing precisely nothing about the project's origin...have naturally fa llen back on a process of wild extrapolation from their only sligh tly less scratchy knowledge of later dynastic times. The Egyptians, it has been established, were obsessed with death and immortality, with the embalming of the dead, with preparations for life in the nether-world. Therefore the Great Pyramid Project represents the same obs ession magnified to the Nth degree. And so the scene described for us is a kind of gothic melodrama 3"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction: Arcanum Organon unequalled in its sheer antedil uvian lunacy.

To satisfy this man's me re superstitious whim, thousands of slaves toil day after day to drag gigantic blocks of masonry up mighty ramps with the aid of nothing better than primitive sleds, levers, ropes and rollers. Overseers drawn from the serried ranks of Hollywood extras bark crude orders, wave cruder charts.... And the result? The Great Pyramid - a building so perf ect and yet so enormous that its constr uction would tax the skills and resources even of today's technology almost to the breaking point.... 3 And not only would it tax the skills and resources of our technology, but suffice it to say that a project of this sc ope would literally \"tax\" the economies of today's most powerful nations. So what then does one make of the \"pharaonic tomb\" hypothesis still found in every college textbo ok of the western world? The sober truth is, of course, that no historian has yet advanced any explanation of the Great Pyramid' s construction that is at all convincing. Nobody alive today knows for certain how the Pyramid was erected, how long it was in the buildi ng, how its near perfect alignments were achieved before the invention of the compass, or how its outer casing was joined and polished with such unsurpassed accuracy. Nor have historians produced any convincing theo ry as to why such an enormous undertaking, combined with such incr edible accuracy, should have been deemed necessary for the construction of a mere tomb and funery monument to a dead king who in any case apparently never occupied it. 4 In view of all the vast mathematics and physics embodied in this engineering feat, \"We have no choice but to look at th e questions of how and why afresh. The accepted answers just will no longe r do.\" 5 And looking at such problems afresh implies that one look at the persistent paleographic traditions of all the world's oldest 3 Peter Lemesurier, The Great Pyramid Decoded (Avon Books: 1977), pp. 8-9. 4 Ibid., p. 6. 5 Ibid., p. 11. 4"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star civilizations that imply a \"cataclysmic destruction of an earlier world whose knowledge and technical achievements were far in advance of anything so far attributed by history to so-called earl y man, and may have indeed rivaled or even surpassed our own.\" 6 So one is left with the three basic implied assumptions of any non- orthodox explanation of the structure: (1) It was built by humans 7 of a paleoancient Very high Civilization for a purpose whic h can best be ascertained: (a) by a careful analysis of relevant ancient texts, and (b) by comparison of those texts with an analysis of the structure itself on the basis of the latest physical theories and so lid scientific hypothesis and conjecture; (2) the human civilization that built the Pyramid was of a particular type possibly capable of interplanetary travel; and, (3) Subsequent civilization, representi ng a decline in scientific and technological sophistication from the civilization which built it, placed interpretations upon it in the most technical language available to them, namely, the religio-astrological explanations common to ancient priest-craft. A. An Old Turkish Map The idea that there was once a paleoancient Very High Civilization of great scientific and technologi cal sophistication is central to the thesis that the Great Pyramid was some sort of weapon and that some of the older structures of the Giza compound constituted a military complex. Most researchers, except of course the Egyptologists and historians in the universities, are agreed on the existence of some such paleoancient Very high Civilization.

But what are these treasured notions? At some risk of over-simplification, the academic consensus is broadly: â€¢ Civilization first developed in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East â€¢ This development began after 4000 BC, and culminated in the emergence of the earliest true civilizations (Sumer and Egypt) around 3000 BC, soon followed by the Indus Valley and China. â€¢ About 1500 years later, civiliza tion took off spontaneously and independently in the Americas. â€¢ Since 3000 BC in the Old World (a nd about 1500 BC in the New) civilization has steadily \"evolved\" in the direction of ever more refined, complex and productive forms. â€¢ In consequence, and particularly by comparison with ourselves, all ancient civilizations (and all thei r works) are to be understood as essentially primitive (the Sumerian astronomers regarded the heavens with unscientific awe, and even the pyramids of Egypt were bu ilt by 'technological primitives'). 8 One of the anomalies that threw all this in to a cocked hat was the discovery of the map of the Turkish admiral Piri Reis in the 16 th century. Drawn from earlier exemplars, this map was remarkable in that it detailed the southern Atlantic coastline of South America, but also the co astline of Antarctica. Perhaps that would not be remarkable in and of itself, save for the amazing accuracy the map displays of coastline submerged beneath tons of ice, and only recently discovered in the technologically sophisticated 19 th and 20 th centuries. 9 Even this, perhaps, would not be significant in and of itself, save for the fact that the Turkish admiral's map is not the only such map in existence detai ling geographical knowledge of the New World, long before its \"discovery\" by Columbus. 8 Graham Hancock, Fingerprints of the Gods (New York: Three Rivers Press, 1995), pp. 11-12. 9 For the best, and the classic, treatment of this strange anomaly, cf.

Whatever the mechanism, the fact is that a number of other cartographers seem to have been privy to the same curious secrets. Is it possible that all these mapmakers could have partaken, perhaps unknowingly, in the bountiful scientific legacy of a vanished civilization? 10 But what civilization? And more importantly, what sort of \"bountiful scientific legacy\" did it actually posses? B. \"Curiouser and Curiouser \": Anomalous Monuments and Artifacts Whether or not his interpretations were valid, whether or not his argumentation was sound, whether or not his hypothesis exceeded the evidence adduced for it, Erik von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods did serve to illuminate the problem of ancient anomalous monoliths clearly. From the massive earthen pyramids in China and the vitrified cities of the Indus Valley civilization, to the massive structures of Chichen Itza, Ston ehenge, Easter Island, and a host of places in Central and South America, the world is dotted with anomalous, inexplicable structures and artifacts of bygone civilizations. But perhaps the strangest anomaly of all is the existence of such civilizations. Why, out of nowhere, did huma nity leap from hunter-gathering tribal societies to the glories of Egypt, Sumer, the Incas, the Olmecs, and the Chinese?

Despite these inhibitions, the records, monoliths, and artifacts speak clearly enough: these ci vilizations, withou t exception, all considered themselves to be the leg acies of an older, and much more sophisticated culture. That culture, located in the mists of th e distant past, was a golden age, when \"gods\" mingled with men and directed their affairs, when great technological wonders were wrought , when basic morality and decency were in collapse, when tremendous wars were fought with horrific weapons, and when a cataclysm - the judgement of the \"gods\" or of God - overtook mankind. But what are some of these artifacts and monoliths and records? Graham Hancock has artfully catalogued many of them in his Fingerprints of the Gods. While it is impossible to enumerat e them all here, nevertheless some of them deserve mention, as some of the ou tlines of that paleoancient Very High Civilization and its tec hnological sophistication em erge. And there is one artifact not mentioned by Hancock that is also worth looking into, by way of introduction into his own astoni shing catalogue of mysteries. That artifact is the Mitchell-Hedge s Crystal Skull. This solid quartz crystal skull, discovered by the daughter of the British archaeologist F.A. Mitchel-Hedges while both were on an archaeological dig in the British Honduras in the 1920s, is like the Great Pyramid at Giza one of the world's most ancient, perfect, and anomalous artifacts. It was discovered at Lubaantum, a massive Mayan cen ter built sometime around the 8 th or 9 th centuries A.D. 11 But what is so anomalous about a so lid quartz crystal model of a human skull, beyond its recovery at an ancient Mayan archaeological site? 11 Alice Bryan, Phyllis Galde, The Message of the Crystal Skull: From Atlantis to the New Age (St. Paul, Minnesota: Llewellyn Publications, 1991), p. 18. 8"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star In the 1960s, Anna Mitchell-Hedges brought the skull to the attention of the noted art conservator Frank Dorland, who was instrumental in the authentication of the Icon of the Black Virgin of Kazan. Unlike most works of art, Dorland immediately recognized one problem: \"there was no legend, no myth, no record, no reference to go on.\" 12 In other words, the Mayans were unusually quiet about this most remarkable work of art, if indee d, that is what it was intended to be, for the skull began to divulge some very peculiar properties to the mystified Dorland. Underneath his microscope, Dorland began to discover incredible optics of a very sophisticated nature. Halfwa y back in the roof of the mouth of the Skull there is a broad, flat plane similar to a 45 degree prism. This surface can direct light from beneath the Skull into the eye sockets If the Skull were placed on a stone altar having a concealed interior firebox and a light hole up through the stone to where the Skull was sitting, the flickering flames could be reproduced visually as being alive in the eye sockets. There is also a thin ribbon-like surface carved next to this flat plane that could act as a ma gnifying reading glass. Next to the 45 degree prism there is a natural ribbon prism. Extending thr ough the more than six inches of solid quartz crys tal, this channel is free from veils and inclusions. Print viewed through this is not only legible, but also undistorted and only slightly magnified. Behind the intentionally carved prism, mere is a concave and convex surface that acts as a light gatherer to bounce the light to the 45 degree prism and out to the eye sockets. The back of the Skull is formed as a beautiful camera lens, garnering light anywhere from the rear and reflecting it into the eye sockets. 13 The sophisticated optics are our primary interest here, as they bear directly on the possible technology th at built the Pyramid. Up against such a daunting display of optics in what presumably was only an artifact of religious art, Dorland decided to take the skull to the Hewlet t-Packard Laboratories in Sant a Clara, California to be tested. 14 12 Ibid., p. 36. 13 Bryant and Galde, op. cit., p. 36. 14 Ibid., p. 42. 9"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction: Arcanum Organon There the mysterious nature of the anomaly only grew. The technicians at Hewlett-Packard performed two significant tests on the Cr ystal Skull.

The orientation of the X-Y axis and the \"veils\" revealed by the polarized light showed mat the jawbone, now a completely separate piece, had originally come from the same piece of crystal.... One worker said, 'There is no way of proving its age....' Even among people familiar with crysta l and its properties, it raised as many questions as were answered. The exquisite workmanship and high gloss of the finish cause it to appear brand new, but it was the consensus of the lab experts mat, given a crystal of the same size, these foremost producers of crystal components in the world today could not possibly produce a skull of comparable quality. 15 So there it is: a non-dateable solid quart z crystal human skull, with prisms and ribbons \"carved\" on the inside of the s kull, which in turn is \"carved\" from a single piece of quartz with a lapidary skill not possessed today, found in an ancient Mayan site, for which no explanation exists coming from that society. But the mysteries of pre-Columbian Central and South America do not stop there. A site that figured prominently both in von Daniken's and Hancock's study is Nazca, in southern Peru. Th ere on the plain one may find enormous drawings of spiders, monkeys, and \"hum mingbirds\", but they are so large that they can only be seen from the air. Of particular interest is the Nazca \"spider\": Recent research by Dr Phillis Pitluga, a senior astronomer with Chicago's Adler Planetarium, has demonstrated that the spider, like the Great Pyramids at Giza in Egypt... was designed as a terre strial image of the constellation of Orion. Is it pos sible that the incorporation of a 'celestial plan' in ancient and mysterious monuments from many different parts of the world, and a particular focus on the three stars of Orion's Belt (represented at Nazca by the narrow waist of the spider), 15 Ibid., pp. 42, 44. 10"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star could be parts of a global scientific legacy passed on by a lost civilization of very remote times? 16 But the Nazca spider is not the only myst erious site in the \"new\" world. Further north, northeast of Mexico City, lie s the ancient city of Teotihuacan. Here, as in Giza, the astronomical know ledge springs from nowhere, fully- fledged. Hancock notes that Stansbury Hagar believes the street of the city to represent the Milky Way. Indeed Hagar went further than this, seeing the portrayal of specific planets and stars in many of the pyrami ds, mounds, and other structures that hovered like fixed satellites around the axis of the Street of the dead. His complete thesis was that Teotihuacan had been designed as a kind of 'map of heaven:' 'It re produced on earth a supposed celestial plan of the sky- world where dwelt the deitie s and spirits of the dead.' 17 Anxious to test this theory, an American engineer named Hugh Harleston Jr. journeyed to Teotihuacan. Surveying the grounds carefully, he came to an even more astonishing conclusion: What Harleston's investigations had shown was that a complex mathematical relations hip appeared to exist among the principal structures lined up along the street of the dead (and indeed beyond it). This relationship suggested something extr aordinary, namely, that Teotihuacan might originally have been designed as a precise scale-model of the solar system. At any rate, if the centre line of the Temple of Quetzacoatl were taken as denoting the position of the sun, markers laid out northwards from it along the axis of the Street of the dead seemed to indicate the correct orbital distances of the inner planets, the asteroid belt, Jupiter, Saturn (represented by the so-called 'Sun' Pyramid), Uranus (by the 'Moon' Pyramid), and Neptune and Pl uto by as yet unexcavated mounds some kilometers farther north. 18 But why is this unusual? 16 Hancock, op. cit., plate 1 caption. 17 Ibid., p. 166. 18 Hancock, op. cit., p. 167, emphasis added. 11"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction: Arcanum Organon If these correlations were more than coincidental, th en, at the very least, they indicated the presence at Teotih uacan of an advanced observational astronomy, one not surpassed by modern science until a relatively late date.

Even the most conservative estimate of Teotiheacan's antiquity, by contrast, suggested that the principal ingredients of the site-plan... must date back at least to the time of Christ. No known civilization of that epoch, eith er in the Old Worl d or in the New, is supposed to have had any knowledge at all of the outer planets - let alone to have possessed accurate information concerning their orbital distances from each other an d from the sun. 19 Perhaps, given the sophistication of this knowledge at Giza and Teotihuacan, it is more accurate to speak of the rediscoveries of modern science. But there is more by way of anomal ous parallels between the Old and New Worlds' ancient civilizations. C. An Algorithmic Language, Cuneiform Mathematics, and the Curious Geometry of Ancient Hebrew Close to Lake Tiahuanaco in South America there is an ancient Indian tribe known as the Aymara, who sp eak a language ''regarded by some specialists as the oldest in the world.\" 20 This language has some peculiar properties indeed: In the 1980s Ivan Guzman de Rojas, a Bolivian computer scientist, accidentally demonstrated that Aymara might be not only very ancient but, significantly, that it might be a 'made-up' language - something deliberately and skilfully (sic.) designed Of particular note was the seemingly artificial character of its syntax, which was rigidly structured and unambiguous to an extent thought inconceivable in normal 'organic' speech. This synthetic and highly orga nized structure meant mat Aymara could easily be transformed into a computer algorithm to be used to translate one language into anot her: \"The Aymara Algorithm 19 Ibid., emphasis in the original. 20 Hancock, op. cit., p. 91. 12"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star is used as a bridge la nguage. The language of an original document is translated into Aymara and then into any numbe r of other languages.' 21 A designed algorithmic human language? Curious, indeed, but surely only coincidence. But this is not the case. A similar math ematical property also exists in the ancient cuneiform of Sumeria, thousands of miles away. Mathematicians, especially those dealing with graph theory - the study of points joined by lines - are familiar w ith the Ramsey Graph Theory, named for Frank P. Ramsey, a British mathem atician who, in a paper read to the London Mathematical society in 1928, suggested a method for calculating the number of various ways in whic h points can be connected and the shapes resulting therefrom.... The Theory offered by Ramsey made it possible to show, for example, that wh en six points repres enting six people are joined by either re d lines (connecting any tw o who know each other) or blue lines (connecting any two who ar e strangers), the result will always be either a red or a blue triangle. The results of calculating the possibilities for joining (or not joining) points can best be illustrated by some examples. Underlying the resulting graphics (i.e., shapes) are the so-called Ramsey Numbers, which can be co nverted to graphs connecting a certain number of dots. I find that this results in dozens of \"graphs\" whose similarity to the Mesopotamia cuneiform signs is undeniable.\" 22 Yet another Semitic language has oddly, and hugely, mathematical properties. The mathematician Stan Tene n has computer modeled the characters of the Hebrew alphabet, demonstrating not only rotational symmetries and torus knots, but that An extraordinary and unexpected geomet ric metaphor (exists) in the letter sequence of the Hebrew text of Genesis that underlies and is held in common by the spiritual traditions of the ancient world.

And that, of course, only increases the mystery. D. Strange Religions Parallel s: Virachocha and Osiris It is reasonable to assume that if there are such strong scientific correlations between the ancient civili zations of the Old and New Worlds, that there might also be correlations in their religions as well. The ancient Incan Creator God, Viracocha, for ex ample, possesses some interesting parallels with the Egyptian myth of Osiris. Although there are huge difference between the traditions it is bizarre hat Osiris in Egypt and Thunapa-Viracocha in South America should have had all of the followi ng points in common: â€¢ both were great civilizers; â€¢ both were conspired against; â€¢ both were struck down; â€¢ both were sealed inside a container or vessel of some kind; â€¢ both were then cast into a river; â€¢ both eventually reached the sea. Are such parallels to be dismissed as coincidences or could there be some underlying connection? 24 The difficulty in establishing this connection is almost insurmountable. 23 www.meru.org.

Olmec carvings depict a racial class not indigenous to the area at all. 25 One might refer to this as the \"Synoptic Problem\" of ancient civ ilizations: why do so many emerge in such widely disparate places and so fully formed? Hancock's answer to this question is intriguing: It occurred to me that one plausible e xplanation might lie in a variant of the 'hypothetical third party' theory originally put forward by a number of leading Egyptologists to ex plain one of the great puzzles of Egyptian history and chronology. The archaeological evidence suggested that rather than developing slowly and painfully, as is normal with human societies, the civilization of Ancient Egypt, like that of the Olmecs, emerged all at once and fully formed. Indeed, the period of transition from primitive to advanced society appears to have been so short mat it makes no kind of historical sense. Technological skills that should have taken hundreds of ev en thousands of years to evolve were brought into use almost overnight -and with no apparent antecedents whatever. 26 The ultimate question boils down to \"what was that 'common but exceedingly ancient source?'\" It makes no rational se nse to \"argue\" merely that civilization \"took off\" much later in Mexico than in Egypt and Mesopotamia. 27 Indeed, that is not an argument at all, merely avoidance of the issue. But having pointed out the fallaci ousness of that line of reasoning, Hancock then proceeds to elaborate a different hypothesis, and it is worth quoting him extensively at this point: Finally, let us turn again to Egypt of the Pyramid Age and the privileged status of pharaoh, which enabled him to circumvent the trials of the underworld and to be reborn as a star. Ritual in cantations were part of the process. Equally impor tant was a mysterious ceremony known as 'the opening of the mouth', always conducted after the death of the pharaoh and believed by archaeologists to date back to pre-dynastic times.

This was used 'to open the mouth' of the deceased God-King, an action thought necessary to ensure his resurrection in the heavens. Surviving reliefs and vignettes showing this ceremony leave no doubt that the mummified corpse was struck a hard physical blow with the peshe nkhef. In addition, evidence has recently emerged which indicates that one of the chambers within the great Pyramid at Giza may have served as the location for this ceremony. All this finds a strange, distorted twin in Mexico. We have seen the prevalence of human sacrifice there in pre-conquest times. Is it coincidental that the sacrificial venue was a pyramid, that the ceremony was conducted by a high priest and four assistants, that a cutting instrument, the sacrificial knife, was used to strike a hard physical blow to the body of the victim, and that the victim's soul was believed to ascend directly to the heavens, sidestepping the perils of the underworld.... Could it be, therefore, that what confronts us he re, in widely separated geographical areas, and at diffe rent periods of history, is not just a series of startling coincidences but some faint and garbled common memory originating in the most distan t antiquity? It doesn't seem that the Egyptian ceremony of the opening of he mouth influenced directly the Mexican ceremony of the same name (o r vice versa for that matter). The fundamental differences between the two cases rule that out. What does seem possible, however, is that their similarities may be the remnants of a shared legacy received from a comm on ancestor. The peoples of Central America did one thing with that leg acy and the Egyptians another, but some common symbolism and nomenclature was retained by both. 28 We are now in a position to trace the outlines of the paleoancient Very High Civilization. There is one important distinction that must be pointed out. In Hancock's version of this thesis, Egypt and Mesopotamia are the legacies of that civilization, and Giza itself, in th at model, is to some extent a part of that legacy, a part of Egypt. Bu t in the version I am proposing, the 28 Hancock, op. cit., pp. 142-143.

What are the common outlines of this Very High Civilization that emerge from this cursory survey? If we assume that these artifacts are all the result of having sprung from some common source, then those outlines become rather clear: â€¢ It was a civilization preoccupied w ith death, or ra ther, death was a theme that the legacy civilizations retained from the more ancient precursor, and this theme may have been distorted in transmission. â€¢ It was also a civilization possesse d, apparently, of sophisticated physical (including optical), as tronomical, and mathematical science. â€¢ It was also a civilization that possessed some form of advanced computational technology and the knowledge of algorithms that goes with it. â€¢ The paleoancient Very High Civi lization that built the Great Pyramid and perhaps some of the other monuments at Giza was based very likely in North Afri ca and in Mesopotamia, since the legacy civilizations spring up there first. â€¢ The paleoancient Very High Civ ilization was possibly global in extent, a fact that may account for the \"simultaneous\" emergence of civilizations in Egypt and the Americas. This is not to say that there were not several societies within that global culture, for indeed, the records indicate that this culture ripped itself apart in a series of devastating wars, to be finally buried in a cataclysm of environmental disasters. â€¢ A certain amount of evidence exists to suggest that one element or society within that culture was strongly possessed by an ideology that applied its technology and s ophisticated science in the pursuit of vastly evil goals, perhaps atte mpting to dominate other societies within it.

E. The Wrong Paradigm? Hancock and Bauvall indicate that the \"wrong paradigm\" or \"program\" has been used when interpreting the ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts. The attempt to understand the Pyramids, and the Pyramid Texts, in any other way than the way indicated by the religion of the Egyptians themselves is, for them, precisely the wrong paradigm. 30 But this appears to be too conventional, for neither the science, nor the technology, nor even the religion embedded in the Pyramid by its builders, was in any way conventional. But for all that, we shall discover in the next chapter that the Pyramid's builders' religion was based primarily in the physics, and not vice versa. 29 From the Bible to the Aztec myths of Quet zocoatl, the image of a serpent bringing enlightenment, as well as the demand for blood, is persistent and pervasive. 30 Cf.

An Archaeology of Mass Destruction From the sands of Egypt to the I ndian subcontinent to the vitrified fortifications of northern Scotland, th ere are anomalous evidences that point not only to an enormous catastrophe that once beset the earth, but to a global war fought with weapons of mass destru ction that may have triggered it. These anomalies form the scenery in which to view the workings and deployment of the Giza Death Star. Th ey constitute compelling corroborative evidence that the Great Pyramid may once have been one of the weapons, perhaps the \"Great Weapon\" and \"Gre at Affliction,\" whose deployment wrought such destruction and initiated such disasters. 1 In this chapter we will sketch this sc enery in very broad strokes. First, we will discover evidence of a pale oancient global war, fought with thermonuclear weapons and demonstrate that evidence exists that weaponry even more powerful and destructive may have been deployed. Then we will survey the very suggestive - and hi ghly speculative hypothesis - that much ancient art and occult symbolism cont ains detailed schematics of very sophisticated technological devices, including, among othe r things, a three stage fission-fusion-fission hydrogen bomb.

A. Evidence of a Paleoancient War Utilizing Weapons of Mass Destruction In an excellent study called Technol ogy of the Gods: the Incredible Sciences of the Ancients, author David Hatcher Childress explores the evidence that exists for an \"Ancient Atomic Warfare.\" 2 On February 16, 1947, the New York Herald Tribune ran an article about an unusual set of archaeological anomalies. 1 Zechariah Sitchin, The Wars of G ods and Men (Avon, 1985), p. 174. 19"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"An Archaeology of Mass Destruction The article stated, rather matter of factly and without much reflection on its significance, that When the first atomic bomb exploded in New Mexico, the desert sand turned to fused green glass. This fact, according to the magazine Fr ee World, has given certain archaeologists a turn. They have been digging in th e ancient Euphrates Valley and have uncovered a la yer of agrarian culture 8000 years old, and a layer of herdsman culture much older, and a still older caveman culture. Recently, they reached another layer...of fused green glass. 2 The next statement is the only indication that the newspaper gave of its real significance: \"Think it over, brother.\" 3 Of course, such fused glass can be caused by powerful lightening strikes during thunderstorms. There are, in fact, a class of archaeological and geological curiosities calle d fulgurites. These are br anched, tubular globs of fused green glass caused by such light ening strikes. The trouble is, such strikes do not explain whole areas of dese rt of a more or less uniformly and circularly distributed pattern of gr een glass. Many researches into the hypothesis of a paleoancient Very Hi gh Civilization have concluded that these blasts were caused by nuclear a nd thermonuclear detonations in a long- since fought atomic war. Standard academic theory is quick to dismiss this idea, pointing out that meteors of sufficient size impacting th e desert would generate sufficient mechanical energy to fuse the glass. The trouble with this view is that meteor impacts leave craters, whereas atomic explosions are normally air bursts whose tremendous heat fuses the silica of desert sand and dirt. And this is precisely what one encounters in the \"green glass\" layer: no craters, and vast areas of fused green glass. 2 David Hatcher Childress, Technology of th e Gods: The Incredible Sciences of the Ancients (Kempton, Illinois: Adventures Unlimited Press, 2000), pp. 211-257. 3 Childress, op. cit., p. 211. 4 Ibid., p. 212. 20"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star Researchers into the paleoancient Very High Civilization hypothesis point out that there were at least three known societies within this civilization: â€¢ The Rama Empire, based in the Indian subcontinent; â€¢ The \"Osirian\" society, based in North Africa and the Mediterranean; and, â€¢ Atlantis, based either in the Atlantic or Antarctica. Other variations of the hypothesis include \"Lemuria\", a lost continent connecting Indochina, Burma, and Malays ia with Australia, and \"Mu\", a lost civilization buried under the waters of the Pacific. Four our purposes we will note th at in most versions, the Osirian civilization that once occupied the Ea stern Mediterranean basin and North Africa - and therefore Egypt - was, al ong with Rama, a relatively peaceful and benign society. In all versions of the hypothesis, Atlantis was the warlike society. However, as noted in his book The Wars of Gods and Men, Zechariah Sitchin believes that the war which erupted between the various societies within this paleoancient global civili zation was largely f ought to destroy the \"Great Weapon\", the Giza Death Star, the Great Pyramid at Giza. I concur with that analysis. But this means th at a reconstruction of the hypothesis is necessary, for it is evident that the society that built the Giza Death Star was hardly the peaceful and benign \"Osirian\" society. Accordingly, I believe that the \"Atlantean\" society extended itself to North Africa, and specifically to Egypt. The later civilization of Egypt itself was theref ore most likely a blending of Atlantean and Orisirian elements. The war would have been fought, therefore, between elements of the Osirian society - based in the Eastern Mediterranean, Anat olia, the fertile crescent - and Rama, based in the Indian Subcontinent on the one hand, and the Antlantean civilization. Supporting this hypothesis, one finds curious, if not horrifying, evidence that atomic weapons were deployed ag ainst Egypt, the Near East, and the Indian sub-continent. In the southwes t Egyptian desert, near the borders of Libya, Chad, and Sudan, there is a vast 21"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"An Archaeology of Mass Destruction sea of such fused green glass known si mply as \"The Libyan Desert Glass.\" 5 In India, of course, whole cities have been \"vitrified\" by intense heat.

No trace of any me teoric, etc., material has been found at the site or in the vicinity, while it is the world's only known 'impact' crater in basalt. Indications of great shock (from a pressure exceeding six hundred thousand atmospheres) and intense abrupt heat (indicated by basalt glass spherules) can be ascertained at the site. 7 If the crater was caused by a weapon, then it may not have been by a nuclear weapon, since nuclear weapons are not impact weapons. As Childress points out Vitrification of brick, rock and sand may ha ve been caused by any number of high-tech means. New Zeal and author Robin Collyns suggests in his book Ancient Astronauts: A Time Reversal? That there are five methods by which the ancients or \"anc ient astronauts\" might have waged war on various societies on planet Ea rth. He outlines how these methods are again on the rise in modern society. The five methods are: plasma guns , fusion torches, holes punched in the ozone layer, manipulation of weat her processes, and the release of immense energy such as an atomic blast.... Explaining the plasma gun, Collyns says, \"the plasma gun has already been developed experimentally for peaceful purposes: Ukrainian scientists from the Geotechnical Mech anics Institute have experimentally drilled tunnels in iron ore mines by us ing a plasmatron, i.e., a plasma gas jet which delivers a temperature of 6,000Â°C.\" 5 Childress, op. cit., p. 214. 6 Childress, Vimana Aircraft of Ancien t India and Atlantis (Kempton, Illinois: Adventures Unlimited Press, ), p. . 7 Childress, Technology of the Gods, p. 239. 22"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star A plasma, in this case, is an electrified gas... Collyns goes on to describe a fusion torch: \"This is still another possible method of warfare used by spacemen, or ancient advanced civilizations on Earth. Perhaps the sola r mirrors of antiquity really were fusion torches? The fusion torch is basically a further development of the plasma jet. In 1970 a theory to develop a fusion torch was presented at the New York aerospace science meeting by Drs. Bernard J. Eastlund and W illiam C. Cough. The basic idea is to generate a fantastic heat of at least fifty million degrees Celsius which could be contained and controlled. 8 In later chapters I outline my hypot hesis that the nuclear energy of the hydrogen plasma in the Great Pyramid wa s coupled to a superluminal \"pilot wave\" along with acous tic and electromagnetic energy and guided via harmonic interferometry to a target. The result, I indicated, would be an enormous thermonuclear and nuclear reac tion in the target, regardless of the elements which composed the target. Finally, there is corroborating evidence in ancient Chinese legends that refer to a monstrous weapon known as a \"yin-yang mirror.\" Collyns observes that \"It is not technically impossible for the solar mirrors to have reflected light and heat (and electromagnetic?) ra diation from a central radiant core, e.g., a plasma radiation energy sour ce positioned in the center of a crystalline/metallic alloyed mirro r, and held by a magnetic field.\" 9 As will be seen subsequently, the Great Pyramid was designed not only as a crystal and a mirror, but employed preci sely such a plasma, drawing upon the energy of the sun, the solar system, and galaxy itself, as well as upon the energy that propels the sun: thermonuclear fusion.

Evidence of Sophisticated Paleoa ncient Engineering: Allusions of Circuitry and Schematics in Ancien t Art, Language, and Pictographs Ancient art, language and pictographs contain allusions and resemblances to sophisticated circuitry and other schematics. Moreover, occult systems such as Rosicrucianism, masonry, the Qabala and Alchemy, not to mention ancient classical systems such as Pythagoreanism, contain a great deal of sophistication in the display of co mplex, and apparently meaningless geometrical patterns.

This is because the pictographs of m odern circuitry schematics and that of the paleophysics - if it existed at al l - may have been entirely different. We have no way of knowing for certain that such ancient art and artifacts were intended to encode or disguise such schematics. â€¢ Secondly, any simple comparison doe s not account for the historical origins of our own schematic pictogra phs.

However, the fact remains that the resemblances are there, and it must therefore be conceded that such diagrams might be construed as technological information. 1. Two Faces of Viracocha In the ancient ruins at Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, the famous \"Sun Gate\" contains a mural, the central figure of which most scholars agree to be the Creator-God Viracocha. 10 The unusual feature of this mural, besides its astonishing workmanship and precise sy mmetry, is the ease with which it bears an analog to certain t echnical devices found only in the latter half of the twentieth century. If one understands the mural to be a schematic, and retains the same rotational plane, the mural could just as likely be depicting a vacuum tube of some sort, complete with electrodes, plugs, and circuitry. More suggestive, however, is its over-all resemblance to a bomb, complete with fins, altimeter, firing circuitry, and implos ion devices surrounding a cr itical mass of fissile material divided into three parts, with possible shields of neutron initiators (polonium and so on), according to the following schematic. In other words, on one view, one has here a very simple schematic for a workable three stage fission-fusion-fission bomb, complete with implosion detonator and surrounding casing of fissile material. An atomic bomb is needed to generate the necessary heat to initiate a hydrogen fission reaction, which in turn generates enough energy to cause further fission in the outer casing of the bomb. 10 Zecharia Sitchin, The Lost Realms, Book IV of The Earth Chronicles (Avon, 1990), p. 218. 25"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" Figure 2: Viracocha: \"A Hydrogen Bomb?\" The symmetry of the schematic along its central axis also suggests that this was intended to be the diagram of a three dimensional object that was round along the vertical axis. The analysis of the mural in terms of nuclear bomb engineering would suggest an aesth etic corroboration to Sitchin's thesis that the paleoancient Very High Civ ilization possessed nuclear weapons and used them in wars. It would also app ear to corroborate th e strong resemblance between passages in the Hindu epics and actual nuclear and thermonuclear detonations. 11 2.

Even in the relatively sophisticated mathematical culture of the Renaissance this is the case, and so it appears reasonable to conclude that the mathematics and geometries themselves were not actually the secrets that were so zealously guarded, but what that geometry and mathematics actually meant. Since the occult meanings of such symbolism is fairly easy to come by and hence no great secret at a ll, perhaps the \"secret\" may be explained as the rudiments of an encoded science all but forgotten. The answer to the second heading li es once again in the supposition of a paleoancient Very High Civ ilization, for which these geometries constituted a \"key\" not only to unlock th eir unified physics but also to engineer it.

There is, however, a certain body of ev idence that suggest s that research into paleophysics has been and is being conducted in secret, both by governments, and by secret societies. A pattern -small though persistent - does emerge of secret society interest in such esoteric physics, dating back to the Pythagoreans and Platonists (as we shall see) and winding its way through the Rosicrucians and other such societies down to our own day. In particular, it would appear that some Freemasons have made such research an ongoing component of their studies. With respect to ancient megaliths and monuments such as the Great Pyramid or Stonehenge, John Mitchell, in City of Revelation, comments that 'the traditions relating to these monument s are unanimous in claiming that they are relics of a former elemental science, founded upon principles of which we are now ignorant.' Among Masons the search for these lost principles has become an essential feature of their secret society. In November 1752, when George Washington became a Mason in Fredericksonburg, he heard the following words: \"The proper business of a Mason is astronomical, chemical, geological and moral science, and more particularly that of the ancients, with all the mysteries and fables founded upon it. \"Let us endeavor to turn the stream; to go from priest-craft to science, from mystery to knowledge, from allegory to real history.\" 15 Of course, the capstone of the Great Py ramid, \"said to have been made of pure crystal\" and \"believed to have attracted and transmitted cosmic rays,\" 16 is a favorite symbol of Masonry, being 15 Colin Wilson and Rand Flem-Ath, The Atlantis Blueprint: unlocking the Ancient Mysteries of a Long-Lost Civilization (New York: Delacorte, 2000), pp. xiii-xiv, emphasis added by Wilson and Flem-Ath.

What must be mentioned here is the amazing consistency of these four talismans not only across ancient cultural traditions but also through history. For example, the symbolism app ears in the four minor suits of the typical Tarot deck as Cups, Swords, Wands, and Pentacles, or our modern playing card deck as Hearts, Spades, Clubs, and Diamonds.

In 1981, just five years after the publication of his first book, The Twelfth Planet, astronomers from NASA (among whose founding members were prominent former German scientists) and the US Marine Observatory in Washington D.C. were actively searching for this mysterious planet An (and presumably her alleged inhabitants). Simultaneously, geneticists backed by billions of dollars in public research money began decoding the Book of Life, our DNA, possibly in search of Enki's, the genetic artist's, \"signature.\"... In 1982, the space telescope IRAS (infrared astronomical station) saw what had not been seen for perhaps two thousa nd years. On December 30, 1983, the world press reported that the advanced space telescope: \"Discovered a celestial body in the di rection of the constellation Orion, which possibly is as big as the gigantic Jupiter and perhaps so close to the earth that it could beglong to our solar system.... When IRAS researcheers saw the mysterious celestial body an d calculated that it was possibly eighty billion kilo meters away from earth, they speculated that it is moving towards earth.\" In 1987, NASA confirmed what the ancient Sumerians knew: \"an eccentric tenth planet orbits the Sun.\" 23 Recently of course geneticists have confirmed another of Sitchin's hypotheses, namely, by demonstrating fr om human DNA material that we all stem from a common mother. But more intriguing is what is not mentioned by Henry: How did NASA know where to look, and why were they looking for it? The detection of a planetary b ody, especially one orbiting our own sun, is a long and time-consuming process.

The notion of a \"NASA within NASA\" is not new to Hoagland, however. Indeed, with Hoagland, one has an i ndividual who was once on the \"inside\" at NASA, and who came to this interpre tation of events rather late in the game, and for very specific reasons. But the idea is not a new one. Ever since the assassination of President Kenne dy, there has been in circulation a curious, and detailed, document known to most assassination researchers known as \"the Torbitt Document,\" comp iled by a Texas attorney with good political connections in Texas polit ics.

According to the document President Kennedy's attempt to interfere, curtail and acquire information from this project played a primary, if not the primary, factor in his assassination. While none of these isolated cases of facts are significant enough proof in and of themselves, I do believe that taken together they constitute a significant enough body of evidence to suggest a pattern of ongoing secret society and/or governmental research into paleophysical matters.

New Interpretive Principles: The Paradigm of Systems Entanglement Physics If the Great Pyramid was a weapon of mass destruct ion it stands to reason that it employed principles of ph ysics and engineering unknown to, or inadequately appreciated or ignore d by contemporary physics. The method employed in this book is to extrapol ate those physics principles based on what is already known in phys ics, either in currently accepted theory or past - and now rejected - ideas. Thus, our extrapolation will proceed along two tracks, one, the track of current theory and research, and the other, the track of ancient texts and the type of phys ics that might be implied by them. This method is obviously not without its problems, for it is possible that the physics represented by the Pyramid was so advanced that a radical restructuring of our own theoretical mode ls may be required to apprehend it. Likewise it is entirely possible that some new discovery may yet be found that would require the modification of part or all of the hypothetical reconstruction of that physics presented here.

However, it must be understood that this chapter is not to be constr ued as the primary evidence on which that physics is postulated, nor as the ulti mate foundation on which the pyramid weapons hypothesis rests. Physicist Paul A. LaViolette states the case for this \"principle of paleophysical interpre tation\" as follows: A thorough study of the va rious myths and lore carrying this science of creation indicates that it probabl y was not devel oped through loose analogy and speculative ph ilosophy. Rather, its orig inators seem to have known precisely what they were doing. Available evidence shows the existence in ancient times of a quantitative science at least as s ophisticated as our own, one that provided the basis for a relatively in-depth understanding of reaction system behavior and microphysical phenomena. 2 The reason that these myths can only recently be understood as embodying a sophisticated physics is that \"only recen tly has modern science formulated the theoretical foundations necessary ... w ith the emergence of the physics and chemistry subdiscipline known as nonequilibrium thermodynamics....\" 3 Essentially this discipline, in LaViolette 's hands, is used to explain how wave phenomena might account for fast-than-li ght transference of information between non-local systems.

With that in mind, we may now cite LaViolette on the necessary criteria for examining such paleographic evidence as may exist to discover the sophisticated paleophysics version of th e cosmological model LaViolette and others believe to have been at work in those myths: In determining whether a given myth or lore shows a strong correlation with a modern creation physics paradigm, 4 the following three criteria should be applied. First, there shou ld be some indication that the ancient myth or esoteric lore attempts to describe the origin of the universe or the process of physical creation. Second, the myth or lore must metaphorically express, through the described personality traits of its gods or characters, several specific concepts or principles corresponding to concepts or principles in the modern creation physics paradigm . Third, the myth or lore should present these metaphorical traits or actions in a sequential order that corresponds to the logical order of events inherent in the creation physics paradigm. 5 The only problematical requirement that w ould seem to be in evidence here is the third, for if these myths and lore are indeed the products of any given \"legacy\" civilization trying to understa nd the more advanced physics of its more sophisticated predecessor, then it is likely that the texts themselves may not be exact in their preservation of th is sequential order, a fact compounded if one takes into consideration the normal and natural corruption of textual transmission. 6 LaViolette's third requirement would 4 By \"creation physics paradigm\" LaViolette means precisely the nonequilibirum thermodynamics.

B. Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts and Sirius As a tantalizing way to afford entry into an examination of the paleography of paleophysics, many have pointed out the connection between the Great Pyramid's celestial alignment with and duplication of the constellation Orion (and in particular the star Sirius) in the ground plan of Giza itself. Those correlations are also reproduced in ancient Egypt's pharaonic death-resurrection religion. 7 This correspondence of celestial alignment and terrestrial religion, plus th e corroborative ev idence of the ancient Egyptian \"Pyramid Texts\" themselv es, is some of the most persuasive evidence marshaled in favor of the various versions of the Pyramid functioning as some sort of observator y, the \"Observatory Hypothesis.\" Yet I am bold to suggest that perhaps two of the most obvious facts about that correspondence have been overlooked (not to mention the suggestive paleographic evidence assembled by S itchin that the Great Pyramid was indeed a weapon): (1) the association of Giza, celestially , with a Zodiacal constellation whose primary metaphorical and religious significance was death; and , (2) the embodiment of that associatio n in the \"as above, so below\" principle of systems entanglement in so much evidence at Giza. 7 Cf.

This conclusion would seem to be finall y persuasive when the parameters of that physics are considered by a direct analysis of the Pyramid and the Giza complex. C. Zechariah Sitchin and th e Great Pyramid as a Weapon Zechariah Sitchin is a researcher who, like Immanuel Velichkovsky, hovers on the fringes of science in some pseudo-scientific territory, proposing, on the basis of a detailed lingu istic analysis of ancient texts, a rather far reaching hypothet ical reconstruction of th e history of the ancient High Precursor Civilization, includi ng, among other things, its extra- terrestrial origins! This does not, however, invalidate the individual and oftentimes unique insights that go to comprise the individual components of his total hypothesis, one of the most compelling of which is his examination of texts that suggest that the Great Pyramid's primary function was as some sort of weapons platform of mass destru ction. This would imply two things, both of which, 8 This of course requires the non-orthodox Very Early Dating for the Great Pyramid and some other structures of the complex (i.e., that none of the main structures of Giza were built by any of the Pharaohs), but much, much earlier by the \"precursor\" civilization so often alluded to by other ancient civilizations such as Sumer, the Indus valley civilization, and, not surprisingly, Egypt itself. \"Orthodox Egyptology\" consistently ignores the fact that the ancient Egyptians viewed themselves as a legacy, and ascribed a state of extreme scientific and technological advancement to their ancestors. 42"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star as will be shown, corroborate Sitchin' s \"weapons texts\", for if the Pyramid was a weapon, then: (1) it was, by definition, some sort of machine, a fact which can be verified by careful consideration of its (remaining) components and construction, a task best exemplified in the work of Christopher Dunn; and, (2) other texts not examined by Sitc hin should indicate a similar purpose or function of the Giza complex. Failing that, they should corroborate it is a general fashi on by indicating in some fashion that there once existed sophisticat ed weapons of mass destruction in ancient times. Thus, the methodology being adopted here does not require commitment to Sitchin's overall model. Rather, taking the texts cited by Sitchin as the indicator of the Weapon Hypothesis, we seek to corrobor ate that hypothesis by discovering: (1) whether or not advanced physics an d/or engineering principles are alluded to in other ancient texts; (2) whether or not those principles are consistent across several cultural contexts; 9 and, 9 This requires some additional comment. The legacy civilizations of Indus, Sumer, and Central and South America, not to mention some North American native Indian traditions, African tribal tradition, and Polynesian and Oriental traditions, all bear witness to some more advanced precursor Ancient High Civilization which preceded them.

This would consequently imply that the paleophysics itself was embodi ed in similar fashion and detail, hence the examination in this chapter of Egyptia n, Sumerian, Greek and Sanskrit texts.

Sitchin's texts relate to the final even ts of a paleo-global war, apparently fought, according to him, with nuclear and other more terrifying weapons of mass destruction, a war simila r in this respect to similar wars recounted in the ancient Hindu epics, the Ramayana a nd the Mahabharatra. Sitchin call this war ''the Second Pyramid War\". The focal point of this war is for control of the Great Pyramid, which is the ultimate weapon. This in itself suggests that its destructive power was far in excess of that imaginable with nuclear weapons, since such weapons were, according to Sitchin, deployed in that war and used in a subsequent war after the Pyramid's destruction. The outlines of that struggle go something like this. The gods of Mesopotamia, eventually victorious over Marduk, who was besieged within the Pyramid itself, dispatch a team to enter the structure, inventory its contents, and designate which components should be destroyed and which should be waved for utilization in other devices. Thus, if the Pyramid was a weapon, then (adding to our previous list of verifiable tests): examination is entirely my own, though suggested by Bauvall and Hancock's work. 10 Zechariah Sitchin, The Wars of Gods and Men, Book III of The Earth Chronicles (New York, Avon Books: 1985), pp. 163-174. 44"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star (1) it was, by definition, some sort of machine, a fact which can be verified by careful c onsideration of its (remaining) components and construction; and, (2) other texts not examined by Sitchin should indicate a similar purpose or function of the Giza complex; and, (3) some of its components are missing from the structure, a fact which should be in evidence by a careful consideration of the contemporary shell now remaining at Giza. This list constitutes the first series of Sitchin's \"pyramid hypotheses,\" and it must be carefully considered before proceeding. First, the texts imply that the stru cture was conceived and built as a machine, in this case, a weapon of extraordinary power. As such, the verification of this hypothesis will lie in part in an examination of the form and of the materials used in it s construction. Given the number of mathematical and harmonic relationships alone that are embodied within it, I postulate that the simplest structure that could be built embodying all these relationships in precisely the manner th at they were embodied was precisely the form of a pyramid and no other. 11 Second, Sitchin's texts indicate that the structure was subsequently entered after its completion for the purpos e of an inventory and destruction of some of its contents and removal of other components. The verification of this hypothesis will lie in any trace ev idence that the pyramid was entered prior to its \"modern\" forced entry by th e Moslem caliph in the ninth century. As will subsequently be seen, Sitchin's texts moreover imply the manner of this entry, and thereby the manner of its verification. Third, the very suggestion of missing components means the modern structure is but a shell of its true, former, self.

Sitichin's texts do provide an important clue as to what those missing components may have been. His texts i ndicate that the Great Pyramid's primary function was th at of a weapons platform. Moreover, they indicate that it was a weapon of such destructive power as it exceeded the power of nuclear weapons. They indi cate that its destructive power was so extraordinary that the \"victors\" in the \"Second Pyramid War\" ordered its permanent incapacitation, then this means that the shell that remains at Giza is the secondary structure. The primary components are missing. Consequently, any theory that attempts to reconstruct its function solely on the basis of \"reverse engineering\" its remaining shell without consulting those texts, and therefore without due consideration of what those missing components might have been, is an in adequate theory. In this respect, Baauvall, Hancock, and others are corre ct. The ancient religious texts are crucial to a proper understanding of the Pyramid's ultimate purpose and function. Sitchin's texts and his analysis are now reproduced here in the order of his presentation. (1) General Weapons Properties of the Great Pyramid: We learn more of the last phases of this Pyramid War from yet another text, first pieced together by George A Barton (Miscellaneous Babylonian Texts) from fragments of an inscribed clay cylinder found in the ruins of Enlil's temple in Ni ppur. As Nergal joined the defenders of the Great Pyramid (\"the Formidible House which is Ra ised Up Like a Heap\"), he 46"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star strengthened its defenses through various ray emitting crystals (mineral \"stones\") positi oned within the Pyramid. \"The Water-stone, the Apex-stone, the...-stone, the... ...The Lord Nergal increased its strength. The door for protection he... to Heaven its Eye he raised, Dug deep that which gives life... ...in the house he fed them food.\" 12 It should be noted that the interpretation of these magic \"stones\" as \"ray- emitting crystals\" is Sitchin's own. We shall encounter a different understanding of what these stones may have been with Christopher Dunn's version of the Machine H ypothesis in chapter five. (2) Its Apparently Radioactive or Strong Electromagnetic Field Properties: Ninurta was at first astounded by her decision to \"enter alone the enemyland\"; but since her mind wa s made up, he provided her with \"clothes which should make her unafr aid\" (of the raditation left by the beams?). As she neared the Pyrami d, she addressed Enki: \"She shouts to him... she beseeches him.\" The exchanges are lost by breaks in the tablet; but Enki agreed to surrender the Pyramid to her: \"The House that is Like a Heap, That which I have as a Pile Raised Up - Its mistress you may be.\" There was, however, a condition: the surrender was subject to a final resolution of the conflict until \"the destiny-determining time\" shall come. Promising to relay Enki's conditions, Ninhursag went to address Enlil. 12 Sitchin, op. cit, pp. 163-164, emphasis added. 13 Ibid., p. 165, emphasis added. 47"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Paleography of Paleophysics Again, the conclusion that Ninhursag wore radioactive protective clothing is a conclusion that Sitchin himself makes, based upon his examination of this and numerous other texts. As will be discovered in examining Dunn's Machine Hypothesis, it is a conclusi on warranted by some of the likely purposes of the structure itself. (3) The Motivation of the War: Nowadays the visitor to the Great Pyramid finds its passages and chambers bare and empty, its comp lex inner construction apparently purposeless, its niches and nooks meaningless. It has been so ever since the first men had entered the Pyramid. But it was not so when Ninurta entered it - circa 8670 B.C. according to our calculations. \"Unto the radian t place,\" yielded by its defenders, Ninurta had entered, the Sumerian te xt relates. And what he had done after he entered changed not only th e Great pyramid from within and without but also the cour se of human affairs. When, for the first time ever, Ninurta went into the \"House which is Like a Mountain,\" he must have w ondered what he would find inside. Conceived by Enki/Ptah, pla nned by Ra/Marduk, built by Geb, equipped by Thoth, defended by Nergal, what mysteries of space guidance, what secrets of impregnable defense did it hold?\" 14 14 Ibid. It should be noted that one component of Sitchin's wider \"extraterrestrial Model\" now intrudes. For Sitchin, the Pyramid also functioned as some sort of communications device guiding \"anc ient astronauts\" to a spaceport in Sumeria. He wavers back and forth between these two functions, though his texts clearly indicate its primary function as a weapon. Sitchin of fers no explanation of how it might possibly have done both. Both are possible, particularly if it was a certain type of weapon embodying a certain type of physics. 48"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star (4) The Focus of Nersal 's Interest A straight descending passage le d to the lower service chambers where Ninurta could see a shaft dug by defenders in search for subterranean water. 15 But his interest focused on the upper passages and chambers; there, the magical \"stones\" were arrayed - minerals and crystals; some earthly, some heavenly, some the likes of which he had never seen. From them there were emitted the beamed pulsations for the guidance of the astronauts and th e radiations for the defense of the structure. Escorted by the Chief mineralmaster, Ninurta inspected the array of \"stones\" and instruments. As he stopped by each of them, he determined its destiny - to be smashed up and destroyed, to be taken away for display, or to be intalled as instruments elsewhere. We know of these \"destinies\", and of the order in which Ninurta stopped by the stones, from the text inscribed on tablets 10-13 of the epic poem Lugale-e. It is by following and correctly interpreting this text that the mystery of the purpose and function of many features of the pyramid's inner structure can be finally understood. 16 Having stated this, Sitchin then fails to list the names of the very stones he cites as being so crucial to an unde rstanding of its purpose and function! 15 This requires some comment. Sitchin is doubtless referring to the so-called \"Well Shaft\" leading from the Grand Gallery. This notion strains credibility, because the inside chambers of the Pyramid, during its operation in the relatively \"benign\" function Dunn ascribes to it, would have been uninhabitable, nor in its Weapon mode would it have been necessary for defenders\" to be located physically within it, any more than humans live inside the nuclear reactors. However, there is some merit to Sitchin's suggestion in that if the Weapon Hypothesis is true, the likelihood does exist of yet undiscovered (or undisclosed) chambers and passages far beneath the Giza complex. This idea is strengthened by the allegations of some that not only do such passages exist. 16 Sitchin, op. cit., pp. 167-168, emphasis added. 49"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Paleography of Paleophysics (5) The Textual Evidence Concerning the \"Queen's Chamber \": Going up the ascending passage, Ninurta reached its junction with the imposing Grand Gallery and a horiz ontal passage. Ninurta followed the horizontal passage first, reaching a large chamber with a corbelled roof. Called the \"Vulva\" in the Ninh arsag poem, this chamber's axis lay exactly on the east-west (axis) of the pyramid. Its emissions (\"an outpouring like a lion whom no one da res attack\") came from a stone fitted into a niche that was hollowed out in the east wall. It was the SHAM (\"Destiny\") stone. Emitting a red radiance which Ninurta \"saw in the darkness, \" it was the pulsating heart of the pyramid. But it was anathema to Ninurta, for during the battle, when he was aloft, this stone's \"strong power\" was used \"to grab to pull me, with a tracking which kills to seize me. \" He orde red it \"pulled out... to be taken apart...and to obliteration be destroyed.\" 17 If Sitchin is correct that the \"stones\" were some sort of crystals, then it is likely that they were artificial crystals since: (1) they fit precisely into ce rtain spaces made for them; (2) and apparently could be \"taken apart\" before their final destruction, presumably so they could be phys ically removed from the structure, taken elsewhere, and their destruction completed under supervision. We will return to this point in chapter six. The other alternative interpretation is that \"stones\" represents a more corrupted attempt by the legacy civilizat ion to describe some machinery of a complicated nature that perhaps involve d \"stones\" or \"cry stals\" in some fashion. As will be seen, Dunn inadvertently corroborates Sitchin's \"crystals\" reading of \"stones\" in his own versi on of the Machine Hypothesis. In any case, it is apparent that Sitchin's text s indicate that the missing components in the interior 17 Ibid., p. 168, emphasis added. 50"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star of the Pyramid involved some sort of function necessitating the use of crystals and possibly of an optical cav ity. Both strongly suggest its function involved harmonics to a high degree. (6) The \"Grand Gallery \" and Ninurta 's Ascent: Returning to the junction of the passage, Ninurta looked around him in the Grand Gallery.... Compared to the low and narrow passages, it rose high (some twenty-eight feet) .... Whereas in the narrow passages only \"a dim green light glowed,\" 18 the Gallery glittered in multi- colored lightsâ€”\"to vault is like a rainbow, the darkness ends there. \" The many-hued glows were emitted by twenty-seven pairs of diverse crystal stones that were evenly spac ed along the whole length of each side of the Gallery. These glowing stones were placed in cavities that were precisely cut into the ramps th at ran the length of both sides of the Gallery on both sides of its floo r. Firmly held into place by an elaborate niche in the wall, each crystal stone emitted a different radiance, giving the place its rainbo w effect. For the moment Ninurta passed by them on his way up; His priority was the uppermost chamber and its pulsating stone. 19 As will be seen, Dunn comes to a rather different conclusion as to what fit in the niches cut into the ramps, based so lely on an engineer's examination of the pyramid. He believes that these slot s or niches held banks of Helmholtz resonators. As will be argued in chapter six, in order to function effectively as a Weapon, the Grand Gallery would have had to incorporate some version both of Dunn's and Sitchin's apparatuses: artificial crystalline Helmholtz resonators that were both optic ally and acoustically resonant. 18 Ionized atmosphere gives off such a glow. And as we shall see, the Pyramid was filled with ionized hydrogen plasma. 19 Ibid., p. 168, emphasis added. 51"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Paleography of Paleophysics (7) The \"King's Chamber and its \"Coffer: The \"Net\" of Ce lestial Coupling: He was now in the Pyramid's most restricted (\"sacred\") chamber, from which the guiding \"net\" radar?) was \"spread out\" to \"survey heaven and earth.\" The delicate mechanis m was housed in a hollowed out stone chest; 20 placed precisely on the north-south axis of the pyramid, it responded to vibrations with bell- like resonance. The heart of the guidance unit was the GUG(\"direction determine\") stone; its emissions, amplified by five follow compartments 21 constructed above the chamber, were beamed out and up through two sloping channels leading to the north and south face s of the Pyramid. Ninurta ordered this stone destroyed: \"Then by th e fate-determining Ninurta, on that day was the GUG stone from its hollow taken out and smashed. \" 22 (8) Commentary: The Parabolic Reflecting Faces of the Great Pyramid and a Common Mistake: At this juncture, it is necessary to interrupt the presentation of Sitchin's textual data to focus on wh at is a common mi sperception, and that is that the \"air shafts\" leading from the \"King's Chamber\" (and by implication, the similar shafts leading from the \"Queen's Chamber\") served the function - for those who accept any version of th e Machine Hypothesis (Weapon, Observatory, Communication or otherwise) - of emitting beams from the Pyramid outward. There is a property of the Great Py ramid, unique to it alone of all the Pyramidal monoliths on the earth, and that is that each of its 20 I.e., the \"coffer\". 21 Again, as will be shown, this is only partially correct, as the amplification effect was actually achieved by the huge granite stones th at comprise the roofs of those chambers, and not by the hollow chambers themselves. 22 Sitchin, op. cit., p. 169, emphasis added. 52"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star four faces is indented slightly at the center; each face, in effect, constitutes a parabolic reflector much like a modern satellite dish. As will be shown, only Christopher Dunn has correctly perceived that at leas t one of these shafts must be for the purpose of signal or energy input. This fact has a profound implication for the Weapon Hypothesis and to the interpretati on of the rest of the Giza complex: (1) parabolic reflectors ar e designed primary to receive, collect, and amplify signal input, not to send to transmit signals. This implies that one primary function of the Great Pyramid is as a collector and amplifier. The question is, wh at kind of si gnals are being collected and amplified, and for what purpose? 23 (2) Satellite dishes and radio telescope s have an amplifier fixed at the focal center of the reflector which collect and amplify the reflected signals. This has further implications: (a) part of the missing structural components of the pyramid either at one time resided outside the structure at some focal point in front of one, (or most likely, all) of its faces in a manner to a signal collector on a satellite dish. This would imply that some trace of such external structures as once may have existed should be eviden t, or may once have been evident, in the complex; or, (b) those missing structural components still exist in the other structures of the complex, but their function has not yet been adequately perceived; or, (c) the four faces of the Pyramid reflect an advanced engineering principle making the Pyramid itself that \"collector and amplifier\" - the view that will be 23 Needless to say, the \"extra-terrestrial\" hypothesis is totally unnecessary here, since its could have simply been coll ecting and amplifying the signal of the background radiation of space itself, much as would a large modern radio telescope.

(9) The \"Grand Gallery \" and Ninurta 's Descent: Now came the turn of the mineral stones and crystals positioned around the ramps in the Grand Gallery. As he walked down Ninurta stopped by each one to declare its fate . Were it not for breaks in the clay tablets on which the text wa s written we would have had the names of all twenty-seven of them; as it is only twenty-two names are legible. Several of them Ninurta or dered to be crushed or pulverized; others, which could be used...were or dered given to Shamash; and the rest were carried off to Mesopotam ia, to be displayed in Ninurta's temple in Nippur, and elsewhere, as constant evidence of the great victory.... All this, Ninurta announced, he was doing not only for his sake, but for future generations, too: \"Let the fear ot thee\" - the Great Pyramid - \"be removed from my descendents; let their peace be ordained. \" 25 24 A common question that is asked me whenever I have talked publicly about the Pyramid as a weapon is where its \"signal\" was emitted or \"How was it aimed?\" This involves a massive misperception of the ty pe of weaponry and physics involved, for it assumes that the Pyramid was some sort of \"d irected energy\" weapon, like a particle beam or a laser, a view strengthened by Dunn's very cogent and persuasive argument that the \"King's Chamber\" employed a maser in its construction. This was not, however, the type of weaponry or physics ultimately involved, since the directed energy component was only utilized to access the far mo re powerful potentials latent in the energy potential of the geometry of space itself. This means that its primary energy output came in the form of now-linear directed energy. 25 Sitchin, op. cit, p. 171, emphasis added. 54"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star (10) The Capstone: Finally there was the Apex Stone of the Pyramid, the UL (\"High as the Sky\") stone: \"Let the mother's offsprin g see it no more,\" he ordered.

The \"stones,\" which were anathema to Ninurta, were no more. 26 This is an important piece of information, for it indicates that whatever else the missing Apex \"stone\" may have been, it was crucial to the function of the Pyramid as a Weapon. This constitutes, in my opinion, the strongest reason to speculate that it involv ed non-linear directed en ergy, and that its main \"output\" was through, and possibly in part directed by, the missing Apex. 27 (11) The Victory Commemoration Seal: The Second Pyramid War was over; but its ferocity and feats, and Ninurta's final victory at the Pyrami ds of Giza, were remembered long thereafter in epic and song - an d in a remarkable drawing on a cylinder seal, showing Ninurta's Divine Bird within a victory wreath, soaring in triumph above the two Great Pyramids. 28 (Figure One) Figure One: The Victory Seal 26 Ibid. 27 Cf. chapter six. 28 Sitchin, op. cit., pp. 171-172. 55"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Paleography of Paleophysics (12) The Destruction of \"the Great Weapon \": After Ninhursag had finished her oracle of peace, Enlil was the first one to speak. \"Removed is the Affliction fr om the face of the earth,\" Enlil declared to Enki; \"the Great Weapon is lifted up.\" 29 D. LaViolette and Plato: The \" Reacti on-Diffusion Wave\" of \"Atlantis\" Physicist Paul A. LaViolette presen ts yet another convincing case for the paleographic encryption of an ancient pale ophysics, in this case, in the Critias and Timaeus dialogues of Plato. In this instance, however, we will present a case that goes beyond LaViolette's an alysis, and indeed that of most conventional academic philosophy, by arguing that the \"Atlantis \" sections of these two dialogues may constitute a central core of the Platonic theory of universals or ideal forms, and not ju st an interesting tangential story. 30 That case, however, most be und erstood against the background of LaViolette's \"systems kinetics\" (examine d in the next chapter) as also against the backdrop of his wider criteria for examining paleographic evidence for this ancient paleophysics. But we may outline his presentation as follows. As recounted in those two dialogues, Atlant is flourished until it came to its catastrophic end ca. 11,600 y ears ago. \"The tale, related by Socrates' elder student Critias, was originally told to Solon, ruler 29 Ibid., p. 174, emphasis added. 30 The most breathtaking example of an encoded paleophysics in Plato is the extraordinarily erudite academic study by Ernest G. McClain entitled The Pythagorean Plato: Prelude to the Song Itself (York Beach, Maine: Nicolas-Hays, Inc., 1984). I cannot recommend this highly detailed study enough. Suffice it to say that McClain presents all but overwhelming evidence that something like our modern western musical system of \"tempering\" the musical scale was known by someone in very ancient times. 56"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star of Athens, by priests he met in the Egyptian city of Sais.\" 31 At this point it is necessary to cite LaViolette himself at length: Any attempt to decipher the symbolic meaning of the Atlantis myth must explain why Plato's dialogues divide the myth into two portions. The first part is in the dialogue Critias, which relates the story of how Atlantis was created and gives a detailed desc ription of the physical layout and commercial activities of this metropo lis. The second part, given in the Timaeus dialogue, describes how the people of Atlantis waged war on the antediluvian Hellene civ ilization and were finally destroyed in a worldwide flood. It is here that reference is made to the \"sinking\" of Atlantis. Of the two narratives, the story in the Critias proves to be of particular interest from the perspective of systems science and the ancient ether physics. Like the creation myths ... the legend of Atlantis's creation encodes a sophisticated open-system ether physics that describes how the first particle of matter came into being from the etheric sea. It even encodes a diagram showing how the primordial particle's energy field intensities vary as a function of distance from the particle's center. In some ways, the Atlantean creation myth presents one of the most sophisticated and graphic portrayals of this ancient creation science. 32 More will be stated momentarily about the connection of this encoded ether paleophysics and its connecti on to the Platonic \"Alle gory of the Cave\". For the moment, attention must be focu sed on LaViolette's summary of the Atlantean material of the Criti as and its meaning for physics: When (the gods) portioned out the earth, Poseidon r eceived for his lot an island in the middle of the ocean. This was Atlantis. It had a diameter of roughly one hundred stadia (one hundr ed furlongs, or about twenty kilometers) and consisted for the most part of a very fertile plain in the center of which was a mountain of modest hieght. In this mountain lived two mortals, Evenor and his wife, Leucippe, both offspring of Poseidon. These two mortals had a daughter named Clito. One day Clito's father and mother died, leaving her alone when she had barely reached womanhood. Poseidon, desiring this maiden, made love with her in her mountain abode . Thereupon he fortified the 31 LaViolette, op. cit., p. 220. 32 Ibid., p. 221, emphasis added. 57"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Paleography of Paleophysics surrounding territory by re-forming the gr ound so that alternating rings of sea and land enclosed the central hi ll where she dwelt. There were two rings of earth separated by three rings of sea, all concentric with one another so as to form a bull's-eye pattern. 33 LaViolette then cites the Critias direct ly for the exact dimensions of this pattern: The breadth of the larges t ring of water... was thr ee stadia and a half, and that of the contiguous ring of land the same. Of the second pair, the ring of water had a breadth of two stadia and that of land was once more equal in breadth to the water outside it; the one which immediately surrounded the central iselt was in brea dth one stadium; the islet on which the palace stood had a diameter of five stadia. 34 He the produces the following diagram of \"Atlantis\": Viewed as an encoded principle of an ancient paleophysics, the meaning is plain, but only to a scientifically and technologically soph isticated society: \"In the context of the ancient ether physics, Atlantis's land contour wave pattern charts the electric field poten tial that would compose the stationary wave profile of a proton.\" 35 34 Plato, Critias 115e-l16a, in Collected Dialogues of Plato, ed.

Poseidon's breaking of the land contour symmetry to form alternating concentric rings of land and water (elevated land versus depressed land) illustrates how the X and Y ethers depart from their initial steady-state concentrations to form a wavelike co ncentration pattern configured as a series of concentric shells. 36 A somewhat radical interpretation of th e whole platonic system of universal forms emerges from this, since pale ophysics and the Atlantean allegory are taken as the central core elem ents of the platonic system. This radical reinterpretation may be st be approached by exhibiting how the platonic \"Allegory of the Cave\" and its related doctrine of the soul and its faculties and objects of intellection are entirely recast. The famous Roman Catholic schola r of philosophy Frederick Copleston reproduces the following tabular summary of Plato's doctrine of the soul, its faculties, and its objects of knowledge. 37 36 Ibid., p. 222. 37 Frederick Copleston, S.J., A History of Philosophy, Vol. I, Part I, Greece and Rome (Garden City, N.Y.: Image Doubleday, 1962), p. 176. 59"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Paleography of Paleophysics The compelling thing suggested by this table are the scientific and physics principles embodied in the top two laye rs, for as the diagram indicates, the \"Platonic turn\" ( ) consists in turning from the lower soul and its objects, up through \"Living Things\" through \"Mathematicals\" and finally to arrive at the Sources or Principles u nderlying things. That is to say, a truly scientific understa nding of physical mechanics (the underlying \"universal principles \" of things) requires a methodology of three basic st eps, (1) the turn from mere icons to (2) a perception of \"living things\" (open, entangled systems), to (3) \"mathematicals \", the mathematical modeling of the principles underlying the invisibles (the quantum and sub-quantum) world.

And a very sophisticated physics it is, as we shall discover. The implication is that the Platonic system is exactly what the Neoplatonists actually insisted it was, a deliberately encoded system containing hidden or occu lt truths. But those truths were not what the Neoplatonists, or for that matter Aristotl e, took them to be. They were not truths of a primarily religious or me taphysical nature, but encoded physics. That being said, the implication is enormous, for the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic understanding of Plato - and most academic philosophy since then - may be the most egregious case of misunderstanding in history.

E. The \"Hermetica \" and Hancock Authors Graham Hancock and Robert Bauvall are two other investigators who maintain that ancient texts, partic ularly those regarding Egypt and/or the Giza Pyramid, should be investigated to ascertain the remnants of a sophisticated, ancient, and antediluvian, \"paleophysics. \" As an entrance into a discussion of these ancient texts, known as the Hermetica of Hermes Trismegistus, the following questions are posed: \"But why should the ancients have sought to create a sim ilacrum of the skies on the ground at Giza? Or, to put the question anothe r way, why should they have sought 61"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Paleography of Paleophysics to bring down to earth an image of the heavens?\" 39 Their book, The Message of the Sphinx, largely written to answ er these questions, is yet another variation â€” and a well-argued one - on the Giza complex as-ancient- observatory, with a modestly stated extraterrestrial theme. Yet the texts they immediately adduce suggest a more sinist er purpose behind the construction of the Giza complex: There exists an ancient body of wr itings, compiled in Greek in the Egyptian city of Alexandria in the ea rly centuries of the Christian era, in which sky-ground dualisms form a predominant theme, liked in numerous convoluted ways to the issue of resurrection and immortality of the soul. These writings, the \"Hermetic texts\", were believed to have been the work of the ancient Egyp tian wisdom god Thoth (known to the Greeks as Hermes), who in one representative passage makes the following remarks to his disciple Asclepius: \"Do you not know, Asclepius, that Egypt is an image of heaven? Or to speak more exactly, in Egypt all the operations of the powers which rule and work in heaven have been transferred down to earth below?\" 40 The purpose to which these powers were harnessed, in the Hermetic view, was to facilitate th e initiate's quest for immortality. Curiously, precisely such a quest for precisely such a goal - \"a life of millions of years\" - is spelled out in ancient Egyptian funery texts which supposedly pre-date the Hermetic writings by thousands of years. In one of these texts, Shot Ent Am Dual - the Book of What is in the Dual - we find what appears to be an explicit instruction to the initiate to build a replica on the ground of a special area of the sky known as the \"hidden circle of the Duat\": \"Whosoever shall make an exact copy of these forms... and shall know it, shall be a spirit and well equipped both in heaven and earth, unfailingly, and regularly and eternally.\" 41 Elsewhere in the same text we hear again of \"the hidden circle in the Duat.. in the body of the Nut(the sky)\": \"Whosoever shall make a 39 Robert Bauvall and Graham Hancock, The Message of the Sphinx (New York: Three Rivers Press, 1996), p. 78. 40 Ibid., p. 78, citing Hermetica, transl.

Hence this view, as expressed by the \"legacy civilizations\" has been prof oundly misinterpreted: such civilizations understood the me taphor literally: the universe becomes a living entity, suffused with \"soul\" to account for the phenomenon of systems entanglement.

One may think of it simply as the spatial arrangement of the components of the system, as its geometry. (b) \"Motion\" thus gives rise to differentiated systems; 52 \"soul\" as ''the information in the field\" can thus also be viewed as the underlying substrate or sub-quantum fluctations in the aether, the stressing of which produces non-local entangled systems. They are entangled because they arise by similar processes from the same Urstoff, or \"early stuff\", the \"stuff that existed before matter 52 In one respect, at least, even the legacy civilizations were considerably more sophisticated than modern theoretical physics in their insistence that everything is in motion. Much of modern pre-relativistic physics assumed that local spacetime is flat and not curved, which to the ancients, par ticularly when stellar or celestial motions were in view, would have appeared to be so much nonsense since the theoretical model was in flat contradiction - to coin a pun -to observation. 67"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Paleography of Paleophysics gathered into atoms, stars, solar systems, galaxies, and galactic clusters and so on.

A physicist will perhaps appreciate the significance of this more readily than a layman. A modern physic ist tends to think of reality in terms of a series of physical laws that only apply to items of a certain size. For example, the laws of quantum mech anics work very well with atomic and subatomic particles, but at the s cale of planets and stars and galaxies, not so well.

When formulated in three di mensions, mathematical physics possesses many unique properties that are necessary prerequisites for the existence of rational inform ation-processing and 'observers' similar to ourselves.

Thus the type persists unchanged, but genera tes at successive instants copies of itself as numerous and different as are the moments in the revolution of the sphere of heaven.... 72 That is to say, given two systems that in all other respects are identical, and that arise at different \"base times \" (and therefore places), the \"time differential\" between them suffices to distinguish them. One may even speculate what this may mean. If one envisions two identical life forms existing in widely separated planetary sy stems, it is probable that the average life spans of these forms will vary as a function of the various motions of those systems relative to the larger galactic system in which the planetary systems exist, even if they share a common galactic system. Something like this, of course, is predicted by General Relativity for systems approaching the velocity of light. But what is being specifically maintained by the ancient paleophysics -albeit in as trological form handed down by the legacy civilizations - is that these effect s occur in and are significant for non- relativistic velocities as a consequence not of the motion of such individual systems as such, but as a consequen ce of motions of systems in certain (harmonic) relationships to other systems. A further consideration emerges from these speculations. There is a minor \"discussion\" of sorts occurring in curr ent cosmology.

A Type I civilization is one that controls the energy resources of an entire planet. This civilization can control the weather, prevent earthquakes, mine deep in the earth's crust, and harvest the oceans. This civilization has already completed the expl oration of its solar system. A Type II civilization is one that contro ls the power of the sun itself. This does not mean passively harnessing sola r energy; this civilization mines the sun. The energy needs of this civiliza tion are so large that it directly consumes the power of the sun to drive its machines. This civilization will begin the colonization of local star systems. A Type HI civilization is one that controls the power of an entire galaxy. For power sources, it harnesses the power of billions of star systems. It has probably mastered Einstein's equations and can manipulate space-time as well. The basis of this classification is rather simple: Each level is categorized on the basis of the po wer source that energizes the civilization. 73 It will be noted th at this model of ci vilization types is de pendent upon several implicit assumptions necessary to th e cosmology and physics assumed in the scheme.

But if one can imagine an intelligent species of life with an average life span of one thousand of our years, then the amount of knowledge will accumulate and transmit from generation to generation at a much more rapid rate. Indeed, something like the second proposition is implied by most paleographic evidence regarding the ancient Very High Civilization. Most ancient legacy ci vilizations preserve some form of tradition that indicates that the averag e life span of the members of that civilization was much longer, and this would permit the rapid accumulation of knowledge.

The principle, however, may still be abstracted from the text: (1) the Kosmos is a \"body\", i.e., a complex system of motion composed of several sub-systems of motion, and reacts to local disturbances much as a living organism; (2) motion is change, a temporal proc ess of \"growth\" from chaos to the order implied by a \"system\", and of decay to disorder from that system; (3) the larger the system, the \"larger\" the time gauge of growth and decay for that system; \"Orders of magnitude\" are thus orders of (1) complexity (2) time, and (3) physical scale, or \"size\".

The Kosmos produces life in all things by its movement.... 94 The theme of \"seminal reasons\" or seed s of reason is a persistent one in ancient Greek and Hellenistic philo sophy, finding further extension and revision in the hands of ancient Chri stian writers such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and At henagoras, and in the works of Church Fathers such as St. Justin Martyr, St. Basil of Caesarea, St. Augustine of Hippo, and St. Maximus the Confessor. However, w ith the advent of genetic science and technology, the meaning of the metaphor achie ves perhaps its final, or at least penultimate, clarity. The essence of th e metaphor, if interpreted from the vantage of this scientific and technol ogical plateau, consists of the implanting of specific information, \"seeds\", in the field, \"Kosmos\", highlighting yet again the profound connection between biology and physics within the ancient paleophysics. 93 For other reasons, it is my opinion that th e imagery was original to the posited paleoancient Very High Civilizat ion and not to the subsequent legacy civilizations. It is perhaps significant in this regard that so much biblical injunction against idolatry was precisely directed at those practices that took the sexual and biological image in a literal sense that gave rise to the idolatry of fertility cults and so on. The injunction, in addition to its purely spiritual Purpose, may have also had a mundane one, i.e., to learn to interpret such imagery properly when the right socio-scientific conditions prevailed for doing so, a difficult proposition if one is sacrificing babies and virgins to appease the bloodlust of the gods and ensure a good harvest! Of course, such a position more or less posits that the Biblical God was more or less the God of the putative ancient Very High Civilization.

So, while one encounters the following claim of an interplanetary travel capability - \"And Vishwambhara says: 'Experts say that that which can fly through air from one country to another country, from one island to another island, and from one world to another world, is a 'Vimana'\" 122 â€” this is followed by a \"plausible context\" that suggests not only very unconventional vehicle \"airframes\" but a range of \"stealth technology,\" and the possible atmospheric ionization effects that would result from the use of strong electromagnetic fields, all in a culture that had never even heard of Maxwell's equations: The pilot should have had training in maantrica and taantrica, and antaraalaka, goodha or hidden, drishya and adrishya, or seen and unseen, proksha and aparoksha, contraction a nd expansion, changing shape, look frightening, look pleasing, become lu minous or enveloped in darkness... stun by thunderous din, jump, move zig-zag like serpent, ...face all sides...paralyse... or exercise magnet pull. 123 It gets worse.

The standard atmospheric layers are the tropos phere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. If one includes the ozone layer between the stratosphere and mesosphere, that give s six \"layers\". The clue to the two \"missing\" layers is provided by the passage itself, since it suggest the manipulation of solar radiation in conjunction with electromagnetic phenomena. The Van Allen radiation belts , an inner belt approximately 1000 to 5000 kilometers about the equator, and an outer belt at approximately 15,000 to 25,000 kilometers, consist of prot ons and electrons captured by the earth's magnetic field from the solar wi nd or produced as products of cosmic ray bombardment. Once captured, thes e particles oscillate between the magnetic poles, spiraling around the field lines and emitting radiation as they do. 125 Other texts suggest deliberate knowledge of the relationships of the solar wind, the magnetosphere, and the elec tro-dynamics of plasma phenomena such as the Aurora Borealis: Drishya: by collision of the elect ric power and wi nd power in the atmosphere, a glow is created, whose reflection is to be caught in the vishwa-kriyaa-drapana or mirror at the front of the vimana, and by its manipulation produce a maaya-vimana or camouflaged vimana. 126 It is important to recall that si milar plasma phenomena were observed by Tesla in his later experiments, as well as alleged in connection to the Philadelphia experiment. 125 The text suggests that a component of 'stealth technology\" is thus precise knowledge and manipulation of magnetos pheric and Van Allen-solar wind phenomena, i.e., suggests a very precise knowledge of the magnetic field lines of each point in the earth's surface is required in order for stealth technology to work. 126 Ibid., p. 4. 127 The principle of magnetic image resonance might be modified or configured in such a fashion to duplicate or manipulate such phenomena.

This inference is based on the recent disclosure that the B-2 char ges both its wing leading edge and jet exhaust stream to a high voltage. Positive ions emitted from its wing leading edge would produce a positively charged parabolic ion sheath ahead of the craft while negativ e ions injected into its exhaust stream would set up a trailing nega tive space charge with a potential difference in excess of 15 million volts. According to electrogravitic research carried out by physic ist T. Townsend Brown, such a differential space charge would induce a reactionless force on the aircraft in the direction of the positive pole. An electrogravitic drive of this sort could allow the B-2 to function with over-unity propulsion efficiency when cruising at supersonic velocities. 130 The similarity of LaViolette's article abstract to the Sanskrit text is both suggestive and provocative, not the least because it suggests that one \"source for suggestions\" for such black projects is the \"paleophysical \" investigation of such texts. 131 130 Paul A LaViolette, \"the U.S. Anti gravity Squadron,\" cited in Thomas Valone Electrogravitics Systems: reports on a New Propulsion Methodology (Integrity Research Institute Publishers, 2 nd edition, 1995), p. 82, emphasis added.

The team from the Royal Institute rapidly located the problem: the pressure of the mercury vapor in the rectifiers was too low. As a result, at high currents nearly all the electrons carried the electrical flow, creating an unstable situation in which the plasma started to slosh about within the rectifier. At low current, this sloshing was not serious. If too many ions (the positive charges) piled up on one side, the electrons would be attracted to them, neutralizing them. But at high current something else happened. If the ions accidentally spilled out of a region, the electrons would rush at them with such mome ntum that their collision push ed the ions farther out of the region. This accelerated the electr ons more, and so on. However, a few ions would break away a nd accelerate toward the electrons, pushing most of them back. An ever-widening tear in the plasma would open up, with electrons bunching up on one side and ions on the other. As the gap widened, fewer electrons could pass, so the current... would drop. This is like suddenly unplugging an appliance. The drop in current pr oduces a sudden drop in the magnetic field create d by the current, and the changing magnetic field creates a powerful electr ical force that further accelerates the electrons. In the case of an unplug ged appliance, the voltage becomes high enough to make a spark jump from the socket to the pl ug. In the case of the rectifier, th e voltage builds and builds until the electrons heat the rectifier plasma so hot that an explosion ensues, a nd gigantic sparks jump through the air in the station. 143 In other words, in terms of the sy stems analysis and entanglement being proposed to understand the paleophysics, the rectifier becomes an over-untity device curling energy back into a system that becomes closed (i.e., non- entangled), compelling more energy to be curled back into the system, until a threshold is crossed and it self-destructs. 143 Lerner, op. cit., p. 197.

Man now flies at speeds well above the speed of sound. Scientists said we'd never reach the moon, and we did. If anything emerges from this, it is that science is ever-cha nging, and that change is driven by the all too human desire to find some way to accomplish what some say cannot be accomplished. At one time, science said that everything was harmonically related to everything else. The whole Universe was a dance to the \"cosmic harmony of the spheres.\" That doctrine is now held by mainstream science to be naive \"Pyt hagorean\" notion of a by-gone age of Greek metaphysics. And a little more than one hundred years ago, scienc e believed in a super- fine matter called \"aether lumeniferous\", literally \"light bearing stuff\", as the carrier medium for light and other elect romagnetic waves. No less a scientist than James Clerk Maxwell believed in the idea. That notion, too, was exploded in a famous experiment by two American physicists named Michelson and Morley, and an even mo re famous theory by a German-Jewish scientist working as a clerk in a Swi ss patent office named Einstein. Out of that paradigm-shattering experiment and the equally revolutionary theory that followed were erected two of the stable paradigms of modern physics: there is no aether, and nothing can travel fast er than the velocity of light. So let us examine each of these thr ee things - the \"cosmic harmony\" or \"symphony,\" the aether lumeniferous, and the shattering experiment and theory - as a way of entering the discu ssion of the more esoteric notions of contemporary experimental and theoretical physics. 112"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star A. The Cosmic Harmony: The Harm onic Series and Coupled Oscillators Anyone remotely familiar with music, and particularly keyboard music, already knows about the harmonic, or overtone, series. Even though they may not know the term, they know the phenomenon. It may be easily demonstrated by sitting at an acoustic piano. 3 Imagine you are sitting at a piano. Now, press down the note middle c silently, and hold the key down, allowing the string inside the sound box to vibrate. Then, strike another note c, an octave or two lower. What you w ill hear is the no te you are pressing down silently vibrating sympathe tically with the note you struck. The reason for this is simple. The length of the piano string of the struck note vibrates not only in wa ves the exact length of th e string, but in fractions of that length, in halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, and so on. To see that this is true, repeat the experiment, only this time, press down the note g and hold it silently, and again strike the note c somewhere below it. Again you will hear the note g, a bit fainter than the silently pressed c earlier, but you will hear it none the less. In fact, you can press a ny note silently, and strike any other note, and you will hear the silently presse d note. All the silently pressed notes on the keyboard are thus said to be ove rtones or harmonics of the struck note, which is the fundamental. When they vibrate along with the fundamental, they are said to be sympathetic or resonant with the fundamental. When we press the note silently, we have cr eated what physicists call a \"coupled harmonic oscillator,\" because the silen tly pressed note oscillates to the note that is struck; it is coupled with it. Put in this way, a keyboard instrument such as a piano or a pipe organ is nothing but a collection of coupled harmonic oscillators designed to harness the vibratory energy of strings or columns of air in order to produce th e regular waves that we call musical tones. 3 An acoustic piano, rather than a digital or electric one, is necessary in order to demonstrate the overtone series. 113"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica Once the ancients had discovered this principle, and the mathematical properties governing it were underst ood, it was a natural conclusion to speculate that everything that was in motion was somehow coupled with everything else in motion. In short, the universe itself was but a collection of coupled harmonic oscillators. So what went wrong? Very simply, sound could not travel where there was no medium of propagation, whether it is ai r, strings, stretched anim al hides, or whatever. And once vacuum space was discovered, the \"cosmic harmony\" as a way of looking at the universe in a unified fa shion was on the way out. The paradigm had shifted. B. The Aether Lumeniferous Old ideas have a strange was of coming back to life, and the notion of the cosmic harmony was no different. Once light and other electromagnetic phenomena were discovered to travel in waves just like the acoustic phenomena of sound, science appeared to be confronted with a dilemma. Every wave phenomenon known to science appeared to require some medium of propagation, some form of matter to which the wave could \"attach\" or on which the wave could \"ride.\" But science knew that light traveled through space, which was a vacuum, and apparently devoid of matter such as we know it. Thus came the apparently rational conclusion: there had to be some form of matter, a superfine matter or \"stuff', existing in the vacuum as well as within the \"pores\" of matter such as glass or water, that acted as the propagation medium for light and othe r electromagnetic waves. This was called, appropriately enough, the \"aether lumeniferous \", or \"light-bearing stuff.\" The mistake is easy enough to see now: scientists were merely extending their understanding of acousti c wave phenomena to light itself. They were thinking of light as if it were sound. On that basis, a rather logical chain of reasoning was erected. Imagine one is in a train, and that the train is tr aveling at x miles per hour. If one stood and then walked in the same direction as the train is traveling, i.e., toward the front of the train, at the speed n, 114"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star then one would be traveling at x + n m iles per hour. By the same token, if one walked toward the rear of the train, one would still be traveling in the same overall direction as the train, but at x - n miles per hour. This process is known to the physicist as \"vector additi on\". A vector is used to measure velocity, and a word is necessary about this. To the physicist, velocity is not the same thing as speed. Speed is simply \"how fast\", but velocity is not only \"how fast\" but also \"which direction.\" Thus, when our walking passenger is trav eling the same direction as the train, his velocity is added to the velocity of the train to obtain his true speed. But when walking in the opposite direction, his velocity is subtracted from the train's velocity to obtain his true speed. A \"vector\" is therefore, for our purposes, almost synonymous with velocity. C. The Shattering Experiment and the Revolutionary Theory To appreciate what all this means for the theory of an aether lumeniferous, we now have to go back to the fact that scientists were thinking of light like they were thinking of any other conventional system where vectors may be added or s ubtracted. Scientists reasoned that if they could split a beam of light, and send one part of th e beam traveling in the same direction as the earth's rotation and the other part counter to it, they should be able to detect this aether by the simp le process of vector addition. Why this is so takes a li ttle explaining. The aether itself was understood to be of such very fine structure that it remained stationary in space. Thus, when a beam of light was shot in the same direction as the earth's rotation, they reasoned that the aether would \"blow\" pa st the earth's surface. This blowing they called the \"aether wind\". As it bl ew, it would slow th e beam traveling against it down, and speed up the beam traveling in the same direction. A measurable difference in the velocity of light between these two beams, however small, would verify the existence of the aether. 115"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica And so two American physicists designed what is probably the most famous experiment in twentieth ce ntury physics, the Michelson-Morley experiment. To understand it adequately, we must also recall another fact about pre-relativistic physics: scientists thought of light as if it were sound. While most people may not know the term , most are again familiar with the phenomenon known as the Doppler Effect. Imagine you're standing beside a railr oad track, and a fast-moving express train is approaching you, blowing its horn continuously. Since the vectors of the speed of the train and the speed of the sound waves of the horn are added, the sound waves themselves are more compressed, and the pitch of the sound is appropriately higher. At the inst ant the train passes you, the vectors are subtracted, the waves are stretched, and the pitch falls. The frequency of the sound waves - at least for the observer on the ground - shifts. This is called \"phase shift.\" We are now in a position to unde rstand the Michelson-Morley experiment. Diagram one, from Stan Deyo's The Cosmic Conspiracy, is a schematic of the experiment. Deyo comments as follows: It was reasoned that by splitting a beam of light (F) into two parts; (sic .) sending one out and back in-line with the direction of the earth 's orbital path, (t o mirror A) from half-silvered mirror (G); send the other at right angles to the direction of earth's orbital path (to mirror B) through half-sil vered mirror (G) and glass plate (D); and recombining the two beams in the interf erometer (E) one sh ould be able to detect a shift in the phases of th e two beams relative to one another. 4 Note how diagram one and the way the experiment was configured conform to the understanding of vector addition and the Doppler Effect.

To understand what happened, the math ematics are less important than the assumptions that undergirded them. The reader who is bewildered, or at the least, distressed by the mathematical presentation is advised to realize that the interpretation of the equations, whic h itself is not mathematical but of a deeper philosophical nature, is where th e real importance of the experiment and Einstein's theory lie. 5 When the results of the experiment violated the theoretical expectation dictated by the aether paradigm, two physicists, Lorentz and Fitzgerald designed a series of equations known as the Lorentz Transforms designed to bring the test results and the hypothe tical expectation into agreement. 6 What these equations did, in effect, was to say \"that length shortened, mass flattened, and time dilated as a body moved through the ether; hence it was possible to detect the ether (Sic.)\" by these means. 7 The transform equations of Lorentz made their way into Einstein's theory of Special Relativity.

Moreover, the transforms were essential to Einstein's derivation of the now famous equation E=Mc 2 . 8 Deyo's commentary at this point is breathtaking: (Einstein's) failing was in declaring the velocity of light an observable limit to the velocity of any mass when it should only have been the limit to any observable electromagnetic wave velocity in the ether (sic). The velocity of light is only a limit velocity in the fluid of space where it is being observed. If the energy-density of space is greater or less in another part of space, then the relativistic velocity of light will pass up and down through the reference light wave ve locity limit - if such exists. ...When a fixed-density fl uid is set in harmonic motion about a point or centre (sic), the number of masses passing a fixed reference point per unit time can be observed as increased mass (or concentrated energy). Although the density (mass per volume ) is constant, the mass-velocity product yields the illusion of mo re mass per volume per time. 9 In other words, in the very act of using transforms that were themselves the product of the paradigm of belief in th e aether, Einstein did not remove the notion; he relied upon it but fo rgot that he was doing so. The error lay not in the mathematics, but in his interpretive l ogic. As a result, the velocity of light was misinterpreted as a constant \"uppe r boundary limit\" on velocity for all masses, rather than as a boundary condition between different types of fluid spaces coexisting in the same system. 8 Ibid., p. 172. 9 Ibid., p. 174. 119"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica D.

The error of the M-M experi ment is the test results are also valid for the case where there is an ether (sic.) a nd it, too, is moving along with the same relative velocity and orbit as Earth maintains around the Sun. The tea cup analogy can be used to explain the error. If one stirs a cup of tea (preferably white) which has some small tea leaves floating on its surface, one notices some of these tea leaves orbiting the vor tex in the centre (s ic, et passim) of the cup. The leaves closer to the centre travel faster than those farther from the centre (both in linear and angular velocity). Now, one must imagine himself great ly reduced in size and sitting upon one of these orbiting leaves. If one were to put his hands over the edge of his tealeaf on any side, would he feel a ny tea moving past? .... No. The reason is that the motion of the tea is the force that has caused the velocity of the leaf. One could not detect any motion if both he and the tea were travelling in the same direction and at the same velocity. However, if one had arms long enough to stick a hand in the tea closer to either the centre or the rim of the cup where the veloci ties were different to his own, then he would feel tea moving faster or slower than himself (respectively). Also, if one were to spin his tea leaf at the same time as it orbits about the centre, placing his hands into the tea immediately surrounding his leaf would show inertial resistance ag ainst the spin moment of his leaf. 10 That, essentially, is the reasoning Sagnac used to set up his rotational version of the Michelson-Morley experiment. And the result was exactly what the aether paradigm predicted.

The effect of Sagnac's experiment on theoretical physics is difficult to assess. On the one hand, Einstein most certainly probably formulated General Relativity in part to address its results. This is evident in the conclusion that local space-time around rotati ng large masses is curve d, and can in turn bend light. However, some of the mistaken assumptions drawn from the linear version of the Michelson-Morley expe riment were not discarded, and their effects persist. For example, In the preceding analogy, the centre of the spinning tea (or vortex centre) represented the Sun, leaf: th e earth; the tea: the ether; and the rider's hands: the light beams of the M-M test. In essence, what Michelson, Morley, Einstein and many other scientists have said is that the M-M test showed the velocity of light was not affected by the Earth's orbital motion. \"Therefore, \" they have said, \"we have one of two conclusions to draw \": 1) The Earth is orbiting the Sun and there is no ether, or, 2) The Earth is not orbiting the Sun and there is an ether but since the earth is not moving through the ether, the ether \"wind\" ca nnot be detected.

Einstein's special theory of relativi ty specifically requires that the oneway velocity of light be a constant. If that turns out not to be so, special relativity falls. The Michelson-Morley experiment, however, demonstrated only that the two-way, over-and-back average velocity of light was constant. It did not necessarily prove that the one-way velocity of light in any direction was also constant. Consequently, special relativity is founded on a tentative extrapolation that goes far beyond the experimental results of the Michelson-Morley experiment. 14 Silvertooth's experiment demonstrated that the wavelength of a one-way beam of light varies with the dir ection of propagation, which strongly suggests that the one-way ve locity of light can also 14 Paul A.

Now the transforms are being used for the exact opposite purpose, to demonstrate that there is not an aether and to maintain the validity of the theory in the face of results to the contrary! In 1938 Ives published a paper demolishing Langevin's local time argument. And in 1951, he went further, demonstrating that \"the one-way velocity of light, as defined by Einstein for a relatively moving frame, is not equal to a constant c as Einstein had clamed.

But what of General Relativity, which seems to work so well with its geometric notion of the bending of space by large masses, and verified by the observation of the predicted bendi ng of light around the sun? While the notion seems to be correct, its truth is perhaps less the result of observation than it is of repetitious incantation: repeat the paradigm often enough, and one will come to believe it and interpret observations on th at basis. But the plain fact of the matter is that Genera l Relativity does not explain how a large mass warps space; it only asserts that it does.

Let us begin with a simple question, the question, in fact, that sired the birth of quantum mechanics. Why does hot iron glow red? How would one calculate the glow of a body heat ed to different temperatures? In 1900, as the new century began, Ma x Planck, who against his teacher's advice had earned a degree in physics, not music, took up this black body puzzle. As a simplifying assumption he decided not to let the matter particles vibrate any way they pleased; instead he artific ially constrained them to frequencies that follow this simple rule: E=nhf Where E is the particle's energy, n is a ny integer, f is the frequency of the particle's vibration, and h is a consta nt to be chosen by Planck. Planck's rule restricts the particles to energies that are certain multiples of their vibration frequency, as though en ergy only came in \"coins\" of denomination hf. Planck's constant h would later be called the \"quantum of action\" beca use it has the dimensions of energy times time, a quantity known as \"action\" in classical physics. .... Planck discovered that he got the same blue glow as everybody else when h went to zero. However, much to his surprise, if he set h to one particular value, his calculation matched the experiment exactly...-Physicists politely ignored Planck's work because although it gave the right answer, it did not play fair. Funny restriction on energy was 20 LaViolette, op. cit., p. 291. 126"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star totally alien to classical physics. Newton's laws permitted particles to have any energy they pleased. 21 The next step came with a paper by Albert Einstein on the photoelectric effect. 22 The photoelectric effect is a simple phenomenon that is exhibited when light strikes a very thin sheet of metal: when the light strikes the metal, it knocks electrons off of the metal. Eins tein demonstrated that the electrons were knocked out of the metal by the light in discrete quanta that corresponded with Planck's constant. And this now meant that, in addition to light's wavelike properties, it also had characteristics of particles. For light of a given freq uency, the ejected electron's energy is always the same for the weakest light as well as for the strongest beam. When the beam is intense, more electrons come out but they all have the same energy.... If you want light to give more of its energy to the ejected electron, increasing the light's intensity is not the way to do it. Instead you must increase its frequency. Light's energy evidently de pends on its color, not its intensity. Blue light (high-frequenc y) kicks electrons harder than red light (low-frequency). 23 These particles of light were appropr iately called \"photons\". Thus, a new paradox was born: in some situations, li ght acted as a wave, and in others, like particles. 24 The next piece of the puzzle was discovered by DeBroglie. DeBroglie essentially argued that just as light appeared to ha ve particle properties, particles of matter \"might al so have wave properties.\" 25 Herbert's assessment of this stage of the 21 Nick Herbert, Quantum Reality (New York: Anchor Books, 1985), pp. 34- 22 It was for this paper, in fact, and not Special or General Relativity, that Einstein won the Nobel Prize. 23 Herbert, op. cit., p. 37. 24 Ibid., p. 38. 25 Ibid., p. 40. 127"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica development of the theory goes directly to the heart of the question of the underlying reality of quantum mechanics. It's beginning to look as if everythi ng is made of one substance - call it \"quantumstuff\" - which combines particle and wave at once in a peculiar quantum style all its ow n. By dissolving the matter/field distinction, quantum physicists realized a dream of the ancient Greeks who speculated that beneath its varied appearances the world was ultimately composed of a single substance. 26 But the mystery of quantum mechanic s only deepens when one considers whether or not there is in fact such an underlying reality. This is evident when one considers the relationship between the mathematical model of the theory and the reality that it models itself. Quantum theory is a method of representing quantumstuff mathematically: a model of the world executed in symbols. Whatever the math does on paper, the quantumstuff does in the outside world. Quantum theory must contain at least: 1. Some mathematical quantity that stands for quantumstuff; 2. A low that describe s how this quantity goes through its changes; 3. A rule of correspondence that tells how to translate the theory's symbols into activities in the world. 27 The first scientist out of the gate with such a theory was the German physicist Werner Heisenberg. In his theory, a system of quantumstuff is represented by what is called a matrix, an example of which follows. There are special rules for adding, s ubtracting, multiplying and dividing such matrices, the study of which is the discipline of linear algebra, an essential mathematics for so much modern 26 Ibid. 27 Ibid., p. 41. 128"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star physics. Within each matrix, there are obviously rows and columns, and each number is called an \"entry\". Thus, He isenberg models quantumsuff by a set of such matrices, and thus his version of quantum theory is often called \"matrix mechanics.\" A matrix is a square array of numbers like a mileage table on a road map which (sic.) lists the distances between various ci ties. Each Heisenberg matrix represents a different attribute, such as energy or momentum, with the mileage chart's cities replaced by particular values of that attribute. The matrix's diagonal entries represent the probability that the system has that particul ar attribute value, and the off-diagonal elements represent the strength of non-classical connections between possible values of that attribute. Thus momentum p of an electron is not represented by a number as in classical physics, but by one of these square arrays. 28 Bear in mind this summing of entrie s on the diagonal, for it have great importance when we turn to a discu ssion of how the chosen mathematical model can greatly influence, and distor t, the interpretation of the underlying reality. The Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodi nger, who modeled it as a wave form, proposed a second mathematical model of quantumstuff. 29 And finally, Paul Dirac symbolized \"quantumstuff as an arrow (or vector) pointing in a certain direction in an abstract space of many dimensions.... A big part of Dirac's theory concerns how to change from one coordinate system to another, how to transform between seem ingly different desc riptions of the same rotating arrow.\" It is this aspect of quantum mechanics that explains its great success and flexibility in mode ling the subatomic world. It has a \"multilingual facility\" that allows physicists to choose the mathematical model most appropriate to the situati on or problem they wish to explore. 31 At this point, however, an important thing occurred in the history of science, for the theory diverged into two paths.

If one reflects for a moment on Heise nberg's matrix mechanics version of the theory, wherein various attributes of a sub-atomic particle such as an electron are modeled by a set of matrices , then the reality question comes into focus. Any particle of quantumstuff doe s not possess certain of its attributes innately. These attributes are called the dynamic attributes since they are subject to change, such as position or momentum. They seem to be \"created by the measurement context itself,\" 32 that is to say, by the mere act of observing them. And this raises the obvious question. If they are created by observation, or in any degree influenced by it, what then is the reality of the stuff itself? Is it real in and of itself? Or does observing it, so to speak, create reality? The mathematician John von Neumann, about whom we will have much more to say, posed the question in his famous \"proof: What von Neumann showed was that if you assu me that electrons are ordinary objects or are constructed of ordinary objects - entities with innate dynamic attributes - then the behavior of these objects must contradict the predictions of quantum theory.... Thus, according to the quantum bible, electrons cannot be ordinary objects, nor can they be constructed of (presently unobservable) ordinary objects. From its mathematical form alone, von Neumann proved that quantum theory is incompatible with the real existence of entities that possess attributes of their own. 33 But almost as soon as von Neumann ha d proven this, physicist David Bohm proved the opposite. Bohm constructed a model of the electron, possessing innate dynamic attributes, which conformed to the predic tions of the theory. This he did by connecting the electron to a new fiel d, which he called a pilot wave, and which is invisible, \"observable only indire ctly via its effects on its electron.

For Bohm's theo ry to work \"whenever something changes anywhere the pilot wave has to inform the electron instantly of this change, which necessitates faster-tha n-light signaling. The fact that superluminal signals are forbidden by Ei nstein's special theory of relativity counts heavily against Bohm's model, but he was never able to rid it of this distressing feature.\" 35 Distressing only if, of course, one totally ignores Sagnac's rotational version of th e Michelson-Morley experiment. Bohm's model provoked yet another re volutionary paradigm shift in twentieth century theoretical physics, Bell's Non-Locality Interconnectedness Theorem. In 1964, John Stewart Bell was an Irish physicist working at the European Economic Community's accelerator in Geneva, when he decided to go on sabbatical to explore th e quantum reality question. The first question Bell asked was: how was Bohm able to construct an ordinary reality model of the electron when von Neumann had proved that nobody could ever do such a thing? Bohm's model actually did what it claimed: it duplicated the results of qu antum theory using a reality made of nothing but ordinary objects. So the fault must lie not in Bohm's model but in von Neumann's proof. .... As he examined von Neumann's proof, Bell wondered whether a truly ironclad argument could be constructed which would set firm limits on the sorts of realities that could underlie the quantum facts. ....Arguing from quantum theory plus a bit of arithmetic, bell was able to show that any model of reality whatsoever - whether ordinary or contextual - must be non-local. Bell' s theorem reads: the quantum facts plus a bit or arithmetic require that reality be non-local. In a local reality, influences cannot travel faster than light.

Bell's theorem requires for such entities that the context which (sic, et passim) determines their attributes must include regions beyond light-speed range of the actual measurement site. In other words, only contextual realities that are non-local can explain the facts. 36 This non-locality interconnectedness theo rem is yet another vital component of the physics embodied at Giza, for there two nonlocal systems - the solar system and the Milky Way galaxy - are quite obviously ha rmonically coupled in such a fashion as to s uggest that inertial energy is being drawn from them. If such energy is being drawn, then it must rely on the instantaneous transfer of information (inertial energy) from the geometrical configuration of the three systems (earth, the solar system, the galactic system). The idea that reality is a non-local subs trate of quantumstuff or aether has already been encountered in the previous chapter. So what, then, is being measured in quantum mechanics? This question leads to the heart of the issue, the \"Quantum Measurement Problem.\" If there is one universal force to which all obj ects quantum or otherwise, are subject, it is gravity. \"Every object we see is continually pulsing to the gravitational rhythm of distant stars.\" 37 As we shall see, the Great Pyramid pulses to a great many planetary and celestial rhythms. In order to understand this problem, we need to go back to the photoelectric effect and to yet a fourth version of quantum mechanics theor y, the \"sum-over-histories\" or \"path integral\" approach of American physicist Rich ard Feynmann.

If we modify the experiment still further, and pla ce two slits or aper tures through which each photon of light passes, then we will see on the screen or metal (the interferometer) behind it a classical in terference pattern. The problem now is which path did the photon take? Feynmann answered this question by saying essentially that while one may not be ab le to state which path an individual photon took, one may be able to \"avera ge\" the paths of se veral photons to derive a sort of \"statistical histor y\" of the path most likely chosen. But this idea of a statistical averag e does not dispense with the problem, but only sharpens it. In one version of the problem, it means that physicists cannot represent any quantum system's physical state in cl assical terms but rather as a \"wave of possibility.\" But the description of th e possibility must still be couched, like any other aspect of human experience, in terms of a classical, concrete reality. So where does the boundary between our \"classical\", \"real\" world and the quantum world lie? 38 Now note in the two-slit experiment yet another difficulty. If we are beaming photons at the slits, the pres umably, according to quantum theory, any given photon goes through one, or the other, or even both, slits. So why should identical quantum entities develop any differences? 39 The Great Pyramid itself suggests one possible answer to this problem: quantum reactions are responses via Bell's non-locality theorem to quantum states in the measuring device itself. It is important to understand what is being said here.

In this new view, however, it is the other way around. At oms and sub-atomic particles are explained in terms of the macrosc opic context in which they occur. 41 Now we take a final step. Recall that Feynmann's \"path integral\" or \"sum- over-histories\" approach to the two slit problem ultimately means that a photon takes all possible paths simultane ously towards its target. Re-enter John von Neumann, who posited this view as the only possible view of the world.

The fact that most of these paths are obliterated by destructive interference in no way alters a (particle's) primal orders: fill the Earth with your essence!\" 42 In other words, objects such as planets or stars or atoms in the classical sense arise as a result of the canceling out of all other alternatives. It follows then, that the proper type of interference w ith the waveform of those objects, i.e., with the proper harmonics, a destructiv e interference can be established that will simply \"cancel out\" or nullify the objects themselves. That is, interference can be estab lished in an object causing al l its particles to again take all paths; the object will simply appear to disintegrate in a violent cataclysm of all forms of energy. For Bohr, this meant that an electron' s attributes were relations between the electron and its measuring device. \"These so-called attributes are not intrinsic properties of quantum systems but 40 Ibid., p. 144. 41 Ibid. 42 Ibid., p. 145, emphasis added. 134"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star manifestations of 'the entir e experimental situation.'\" 43 That is, one may view all reality, regardless of scale, as existing in some quantum state. F. Plasma Cosmology We have already encountered the electromagnetic plasma cosmology of the Swedish physicist Hannes Alfv en in the prev ious chapter. 44 Lerner summarizes this new cosmology as follows: Starting in 1936 Alfven outlined, in a se ries of highly original papers, the fundamentals of what he would late r term cosmic electrodynamics - the science of the plasma universe. Convi nced that electr ical forces are involved in the generation of cosmic ra ys, Alfven pursued ...(a) method of extending laboratory models to th e heavens.... He knew how high-energy particles are created in the laborator y - the cyclotron, in vented six years earlier, uses electrical fields to acce lerate particles and magnetic fields to guide their paths. How, Alfven aske d, would a cosmic, natural cyclotron be possible? ....But what about the conductor? Space was supposed to be a vacuum, thus incapable of carrying electrical curr ents. Here, Alfven again boldly extrapolated from the lab. On earth ev en extremely rarified gases can carry a current if they have been ionized - that is, if the electrons have been stripped from the atoms....Alfven reasoned that su ch plasma should exist in space as well. 45 This may not sound too revolutionary, unt il one notices what is unique about this theory: \"certain key variable do not change with s cale - electrical resistance, velocity, and energy all re mained the same. Other quantities do change: for example, time is scaled as 43 Ibid., p. 161. The idea of relational attributes is not new to Bohr, incidentally, but is to be found also in Thomas Aquinas, once again highlighting the deep and profound connection between religion, metaphysics, and physics. Cf. Aquinas, Summa Contra Gentiles, Pt. 4, Question 2, Art. 5. 44 For a lucid and provocative account of this cosmology and the issue of the relationship between theory, observation, and experiment that it raises, cf. Eric J. Lerner, The big Bang Never Happened (New York:Vintage Books, 1992). 45 Lerner, op. cit., p. 181. 135"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica size, so if a process is a million times smaller, it occurs a million times faster.\" 46 In other words, the whole difficulty of post-relativistic physics, that of reconciling relativity with quantum mechanics is avoided entirely. And notice what the principle differential is . The principle differential is exactly what the examination of paleophysics in the previous chapte r said it would be, time. But the other laws operate no matter what the scale. 47 Since time is scale-sensitive, and othe r electromagnetic forces are not, the implication is revolutionary. Equally important, though, is the converse use of these scaling rules. When the magnetic fields and currents of these objects are scaled down, they become incredibly intense - millions of gauss, millions of amperes, well beyond levels achievable in the laboratory. However, by studying cosmic phenomena, Alfven shows, scientists can learn about how fusion devices more powerful than those now in existence will operate. In fact, they might learn how to design such devices from the lessons in the heavens. 48 Notice the coupling of elect romagnetic vorticular proc esses with fusion itself, a process duplicated in the work of Philo Farnsworth's plasmator patent (cf. below), which uses virtual electric fiel ds to establish a stable fusion reaction in a cloud of plasma or ions. But notice something else. Lerner clearly implies that if the inertial and electromagnetic processes of the heav ens are somehow captured, i.e., if one can couple to them, \"fusion devices 46 Ibid., p. 192, emphasis added. 47 Lerner, op. cit., p. 193: \"In the reedition of Cosmic Electrodynamics, written with Falthammer in 1963, Alfven gives fi lamentation a central role in pr oducing homogeneities in plasma, on scaled from laboratory up to stellar nebulae - the vast clouds of glowing gass surrounding many star clusters in a galaxy. Wh en a current flows through a plasma, Alfven shows, it must assume the form of a filament in order to move along magnetic field lines.\" This is to say that it is possible to produced spiral filamentary patterns in highly rarified plasma in the laboratory. This has not only been done, but the spiral patterns exhibited almost exactly duplicate the patterns of vari ous galaxies that have been observed. \"As above, so below.\" 48 Ibid., pp. 192-193. 136"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star more powerful than those now in exis tence will operate. \" What fusion devices could he be talking about? No tokamak magnetic bottle has ever achieved a stable controlled fusion r eaction, and it is unlik ely that Lerner knows about Farnsworth's plasmator, since he nowhere mentions it (even though it would appear to be based upon the same theoretical assumptions). The only thing left, then, are the city-busting super bombs that fill French, American, and Russian arsenals. The coupling to the heavens is, of cour se, what one finds in the structures at Giza, and in the Great Pyramid itself. And as will be seen in the final chapter, there is very good reason to a ssume that it utilized precisely the electromagnetic properties of plasma in exactly this fashion. Alfven suggested other aspects of plasma cosmology in an article published in 1942. If a conducting liquid is placed in a constant magnetic field, every motion of the liquid gives rise to an (electromagnetic field) which produces electric currents. Owing to the ma gnetic field, these currents give mechanical forces which (Sic.) change the state of motion of the liquid. Thus a kind of combined electromagn etic-hydrodynamic wave is produced which, so far as 1 know, has as yet attracted no attention. 49 This, as we shall see in the next chapter, sounds ve ry much like the electro- acoustic waves discovered by Tesla in his high frequency direct current impulse experiments. But there are even more profound re semblances between the aether of paleophysics and the modern plasma cosm ology, not the least of which is the concept that the universe exhibits a f ilamentary and cellular structure. Not only does the universe exhibit \"electric layers\" of various densities like a fluid, but Cosmic plasmas are often not homogeneous, but exhibit filamentary structures which are likely to be associated with currents parallel to the magnetic field.... In the magnetosphe res there are thin, rather stable 49 Hannes Alfven, \"Existence of Electromagnetic-Hydrodynamic Waves,\" Nature, No. 3805, October 3, 1942, pp. 405-406. 137"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoteric a current layers which separate regions of different magnetization, density, temperature, etc. It is necessary that similar phenomena exist also in more distant regions. This is bound to give space a cellular structure (or more correctly, a cell wall structure). 50 In this article, Alfven makes his case for an unequal (inhomogeneous) distribution of matter in the universe by pointing out that there is also an upward limit for the size of things in the universe, a limit called the Laplace- Schwarzschild limit, representing an \"instability limit.\" 51 His comment on this limitation is worth citing: \"\"his instability cannot be due to a release of nuclear energy - as in stars - because for the large structures we consider this to be insufficient. Hence, if we do no t want to introduce ne w laws of nature, there are only two energy sources av ailable: gravitation and annihilation.\" 52 As we shall also see, there is the possibility that gravitational force was somehow also being accessed and ma nipulated in the Great Pyramid. The regions of the universe devoid of matter suggested to scientists that it was \"clumpy.\" And this may be one of the most profound insights of plasma cosmology. Alfven's comm ent must be cited, for it deserves extensive commentary. This means that stars should be organized in galaxies G 1 , a large number of these galaxies form a larger 'galaxy of type G 2 - we would today prefer to speak of a 'cluster' - a large number of these a still larger structure G 3 , and so on to infinity. Chartier showed that the mean density of a structure of size R must obey the relation p ~ R -x with x > 2. This leads to an infinite universe with infinite mass but with an average density zero. 53 50 Hannes Alfven, \"On Hierarchical Cosmol ogy,\" Atsrophysics and Space Science, Vol. 89, (Boston: D Reidel, 1983), 313-324, p. 314. 51 Ibid., p. 318. 52 Ibid., p. 319, emphasis in the original. 53 Ibid., p. 316. 138"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star What does this mean? Recall that our discussion of matrix algebra indicated that there were special rules for adding, subtracting, mu ltiplying and dividing such matrices. Imagine now that one is representing the average mean density of matter in the universe by such a matrix. It w ould, of course, be a very complex procedure, but nonetheless, if one summed a ll the entries in the matrix, one would end up with a sum of zero. This is called a \"zero-summed\" matrix, and it would represent what an observer ex ternal to the universe - God - would see in terms of its mean density. Now, we know from simple arithmetic that any number times zero equals zero. And the same holds true in linear or matrix algebra, where such a number is called a \"scalar\" , representing in physics a pure \"magnitude of fo rce\" but without any direction. This is a very important consideration, because one can also represent any point in vacuum space by a similar su ch matrix. Imagine you are holding a rubber ball in your hand, squeezing it. Ther e is force inside the ball, but none observable externally to the observer. Now imagine you have mathematically modeled that squeezed rubber ball by a zero-summed matrix. The force you are loading into the ball - the squeezing - is the scalar. But since modern physics uses this matrix mathematics to model so much, it will tell you that there is no force present at the point. However, when Maxwell first modeled the equations of electromagnetism, he did not use this t ype of mathematics. Rather, he used a form of mathematics called \"quaterni ons\" which said that a scalar - the squeezing of the ball - times a zero-summ ed matrix returned not zero, but the scalar. This meant he employed a form of mathematics that looked at the energy locked up inside a system, rather than outside. Notice also that Alfven, in our rather crude analo gy, is saying almost the same thing. The implication is clear; for plasma cosmology, there is a uniform way of looking both at micro-sized and macro-sized objects in the universe. \"The same general laws of plasma physics hold from laborator y and magnetospheric and heliospheric plasmas out to interstellar and 139"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica intergalactic plasmas.\" We shall have more to say about this \"scalar\" physics in a later section. The cellular structure of the cosmos suggested by plasma cosmology strongly parallels the paleophysical vi ew of the universe as a \"living\" organism: when something happens in one place, the whole reacts. But how is this possible? Bell's theorem demonstr ated that reality is non-local. Thus, if one assumes the existence of an aether, as a \"field of information\", it is rather easy to see how what happens in one \"cell\" of the uni verse is quickly transmitted to another, for all the cells are \"entangl ed\" or \"coupled\" to each other. G. Scalar Interferometry and Nonlinear Optical Phase Conjugation Scalar interferometry and phase conjugate waves, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and sub-quantum kine tics are the next components of physics that are needed to underst and the Great Pyramid's possible functioning as a weapon. These areas ha ve been developed only in the last few years, and one can only speculate on what research is being done largely in secret. But what has been publishe d is tantalizing enough. Let us begin with phase conjugate waves and scalar interferometry. In our squeezed rubber ball analogy, we discovere d how it was possible to lock energy inside of something that would still look to an external observer as if there was no energy inside it. Now imagine alternatively squeezing and releasing the rubber ball, or \"pulsing \" it. This would produce a wave moving back and forth inside the ball. 55 If one now imagines that the ball is the universe itself, then it would seem to follow that all parts of the ball, the \"cells\", react to the pulsing immediately. This would imply that the \"wave\" inside the ball is somehow faster than light. 54 Hannes Alfven, \"Cosmology in the Plasma Universe,\" Laser and Particle Beams (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983) 389-398, p. 389. 55 Cf. V.K. Ignatovich, \"The Remarkable Capabilities of Recursive Realtions,\" American Journal of Physics, Vol. 57, No. 10, 873-878, p. 874. 140"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star But is such faster-than-light transfer ence of information possible? Indeed it is. The French physicist Alain Aspect performed yet another version of the light-beam splitting experiment designed to test Bell's Non-Locality theorem in which photons of light were given certain wavelength characteristics called \"polarization\", and then the split beams of light were then m easured at various places and distances. Remarkably, the phot ons continued to show evidence of their original coupling, and distance was not a factor. 56 This implies that the split photons somehow reacted to each other by some \"non-linear\" means. This means would appear to have something to do with \"nonlinear optical phase conjugation.\" 57 This rather difficult sounding phrase is really rather simple to unders tand. If one shines a flashlight at an ordinary mirror at an angle of 45 degrees from its surface, we know that the beam will be reflected from the mirror at the same angle away from the mirror, giving a ninety degree angle between the incoming and outgoing beams. But the reflected beam will s catter and widen, not only according to the normal inverse square law of li ght propagation, but also because the mirror is an irregular surface. It is not \"in phase\" with the wavelength of the light, so to speak. But imagine that one could construc t a mirror that was so harmonically attuned to the incoming beam of light that it reflected the light back in the same direction it came, perfectly, and without any scattering. The reflected beam not only would not obey the inverse square law, but it would in effect be a ''time-reversed\" light wave, the exact opposite of the incoming beam. David M. Pepper comments on one possi ble use of such \"phase conjugate mirrors\" that are able to adjust the wavelength and time of split light beams: 56 Alain Aspect, Philippe Grangier, and Ge rard Roger, \"Experimental Tests of Realistic Local Theories via Bell's Theore m,\" Physical Review Letters, Volume 47, Number 7 (17 August 1981), 460-463. \"No effect of the distance between measurements on the correlations was observed.\" (p. 463) 57 Cf.

A fusion pellet is illuminated by a pulsed low-po wer laser... Pulses scattered from the pellet pass through the three parallel laser amplifiers ... The intensity of the individual pulses is increased, but at the expense of introducing distortions. The pulses are then di rected to a fou r-wave-mixing phase- conjugate mirror. By the time they r each the mirror they are out of step because they have traveled differen t distances. When all the pulses are inside the mirror, it is turned on, conj ugating each pulse and reversing their temporal order with resp ect to one another... On the return trip the distortions are removed and the pulses become synchronized, so that an intense pulse of radiation hits the pellet. 58 There are some features here that are quite crucial to understanding how the Great Pyramid might have functioned as a weapon. First, there is a coherent energy output (the laser). A beam of laser light is called \"coherent\" because all its photons march in lock step or \"in phase\", like a troop of solders. This gives lase r light its extraordinary power. When soldiers march across a bridge, they in tentionally break step, since if they continued to march in phase with each other, they would set up a vibration in the bridge that could - an d often did - collapse the bridge because energy was loaded into the bridge before it could dissipate. Second, there is a target, in this case , a \"pellet\" of material capable of undergoing a thermonuclear fusion reaction, in this case perhaps it would be a capsule of lithium deuteride. As we know by now, however, every object has a frequency that it vibrates or resona tes to. Thus, if one knew the frequency of any material, with proper \"phase conjugation\" of energy, one could conceivably initiate a nu clear reaction by lo ading enough vibrations into it, by causing it, in other words, to vibr ate or \"cavitate\" vi olently enough to explode. 58 David M.

Finally, there is the phase -conjugate mirror, which collects the split beams and fires them on to the target in such a way that all beams are not only time- reversed but so that they arrive at targ et at the same time and exactly in phase with each other. The time-reversed com ponent is essential because, it will be recalled, it means that the beams do not su ffer the effect of dissipation due to the inverse square law. These waves w ould arrive at the target and set up a \"standing wave\" inside it, rather like a sound wave, causing it to vibrate in lock step with the incoming pulses of energy. Eventually, the energy locked inside the target would cross a threshol d of stability, and it would blow itself apart in a nuclear reaction regardless of the material that comprised the target. That such electromagnetic induction of thermonuclear reactions - the same reactions that power the sun and hydrogen \"super-bombs\" - is possible will be explored in the section on cold fusion. Of course, such engineering capabilities are beyond our current technology, but it takes little imagination to envision a very large-scale applicati on of Pepper's idea. As we shall see in chapter five, there is very strong ev idence that the Great Pyramid employed a large maser as one component of its energy output. 59 And there is one more consideration. Since every object has its ow n resonance, and yet is part of the same universe, this means to some extent that it is vibrating sympathetically with every other object in it, particular ly with those objects in its immediate location - star systems, galactic system , and so on. To initiate the type of nuclear reaction in such an obj ect, one would perforce have 59 A \"maser\" is exactly like a laser, only using the invisible microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum rather than vi sible light.

This, of course, is exactly what one discovers in the Great Pyramid. In this respect, it constitutes a gigantic and super-sophisticated \"phase conjugate mirror,\" picking up the incoming inertial vi brations of the aeth er as they have been \"split\" into the acoustic, elec tromagnetic, nuclear and gravitational vibrations of the earth, the solar system, and the Milky Way Galaxy, and modulating its output energy by the same vi brations in a deadly carrier wave of unheard of destructive pot ential. In chapters five and six, we will present evidence that suggests that this type of phase conjugation may very well have been the function of three of its better-known internal chambers. H. And Some Very Strange Ideas, Patents, and Experiments Physics, besides suffering these internecine conflicts within its \"orthodox\" confines, also possesses persistent stories and allegations of even more bizarre experiments that s eem to run counter to received theory. Here we shall quickly summarize some of them that I believe to be relevant to the weaponization of the hyperdimensional paleophysics in the Great Pyramid. (1) Endothermic, or \"Cold\" Fusion In March of 1989, two physicists at the University of Utah held a press conference to announce a discovery that shook the edifice of theoretical and experimental physics to its very foundati ons. \"It proclaimed that Professors Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons had discovered that practical nuclear fusion could be carried out with relati vely simple laboratory equipment at near room temperature - called the Flei shmann-Pons Effect (FPE). The great news was that the experiment could produce more energy output than was required as input.\" 60 Pons and Fleischmann achieved 60 Hal Fox, Cold Fusion Impact in the Enhanced Energy Age (Salt Lake City, Utah: Fusion Information Center, 1992), p. 1-1, emphasis in the original. 144"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star their result by modifying the simple a nd well-known process of electrolysis. Gone were the multi-million dollar Tokamak wiggler magnets, gone the unstable hot plasmas. Yet, despite numerous successful redup lications of their experiment, there was a problem. Some experiments failed to reduplicate their results. There seemed to be no predictability or regul arity - at least none known or presently quantifiable - to the result. As a consequence, both scientists were literally hounded out of the country by a more \"o rthodox\" scientific establishment. But we perhaps already have a clue: inadequate attention was paid to the overall geometrical and therefore harmoni c configuration of the experiments. This has an important, and often ove r-looked, corollary. During the first hydrogen bomb tests, the actual energy yield of the bombs far exceeded those initially calculated. There was an \"x \" factor, an unknown source of surplus energy that was being tapped. Sin ce hydrogen bombs unleash enormous amounts of destructive energy at the very sub-atomic level of the nucleus of atoms, we may also surmise, in part, where that energy came from and why, for such weapons literally cause a viol ent local disturban ce in the geometry and fabric of space-time. In short, so me as yet inadequately understood laws of harmonics produced the excess energy. But the results of Pons' and Fleischmann's experiment are sufficiently credible to state the relevance of th eir discovery for our purposes. It is possible to induce stable endothermic or cold fusion reactions at much lower levels of energy input than previously thought possible and it is possible to do so by ordinary electromagnetic means. It is a short step to the conclusion that it is also possible to induce unstable thermonuclear reactions by a similar method. 61 We may speculate further that this idea is one of the most closely held secrets of the nuclear powers, and may explain wh y recent additions to the \"nuclear club\" such as France, China, and India insist on continued testing of their weapons; they are trying to discover what those laws are. 145"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica (2) Farnsworth 's Plasmator Long before Pons and Fleischmann performed their experiments, however, another scientist may have b eaten them to the punch by pursuing an entirely different methodology. His name was Dr. Philo Farnsworth. Most people are unfamiliar with his name, and yet they spend many hours every day sitting before his most famous i nvention being entert ained: television. Farnsworth almost single-handedly conceived of the idea of television, and then proceeded to invent every compone nt that made it possible. A glance at his many elegant patents in the U.S. Patent Office will convince one, if nothing else, that Farnsworth was an experimental and applied scientist and engineer of the highest calib er. By the end of his life it is safe to say that no one had a more thorough knowledge of what could and could not be accomplished with vacuum tubes. After all, he had designed and patented almost every tube that made television possible. It was that knowledge that led him, toward the end of his life, into a different area of research: the contro l of thermonuclear fusion reactions. In two breathtaking patents he outlined a method for controlled hot fusion: patent number 3,258,402, entitled \"Electri c Discharge Device for Producing Interactions Between Nuclei,\" an d patent number 3,386,883, \"Method and Apparatus for Producing Nuclear-Fusion R eactions.\" The last patent is the culmination of his life's work.

Using electron optical focussing to concentrate ions in what he called a \"fusor\" tube, comprising a spherical anode surrounding a cathode. On the anode portion of the electron tube, ion cannons were mounted so that their beams would intersect in the center of the cathode. This established \"in the ca thode interior a series of concentric spherical sheaths of altern ating maxima and minima potentials,\" or, in effect, virtual electrodes. As a resu lt, the ions that were captured \"in the center-most virtual electrode have fusi on energies and are contained at a density sufficient to produce fusion reactions.\" 63 By 1965 Farnsworth had tested and achieved stable reactions fo r over thirty seconds, in a design of an electron tube no larger than a softball and that solved simultaneously both the conversion and containment problems that have dogged the multi-million dollar failures of official research. What happened to Farnsworth's de vice and patents? ITT, which had helped to fund the research, bought the patents outright, and suppressed any further development along the lines of c ontainment via virtual electrodes. The line of research pioneered by Farnswort h, as far as we know, was allowed to fade away from view.

Only in this case, we have clear evidence that the \"s huffle\" took the resear ch straight into the labyrinth of the bizarre and very secret wartime research of the Third Reich. These scientists discovered that sound waves traveling in water could produce bubbles, and could then be used to vibrate or cavitate the bubbles to the point that they suddenly burst into miniature explosions of blue light. They called the phenomenon \"sonoluminesence\". The phenomenon was not fully explai ned until the 1990s when American physicists theorized that the burst of blue light was caused by a sonic boom taking place inside the region of the bubbles. Once again, we are back at the analogy of the squeezed r ubber ball. What produced the light was compressed air as it was heated to more than several hundred thousand degrees, a temperature hotter than the sun's surface. The heat produced a plasma, in other words, the intense temperatures of which tore electrons loose from their atoms and producing billions of charged particles and giving off electromagnetic radiation in the form of the blue light. These scientists made a startling conc lusion - startling to modern science, but not, perhaps, to the paleophysics al ready encountered - that there was a relationship between acoustic and elect romagnetic energy that was more intimate than previously thought to be the case. This leads to a bold conjecture on the possible w eaponization of such a phenomenon. (1) Every object or material substa nce has a resonant frequency.

The purpose of this vast phased antenna array is to beam billions of watts of power up into the ionopshere of the earth, thus \"heating\" a portion of the atmosphere and lifting\" it, creating an area of low pressure. To understand the relevance of this frightening project to the Great Pyramid weapons system, we need only understand two things about it.

Second, and much more important, are the original patents by American physicist Bernard Eastland on which the pr oject is based, U.S. Patent number 5,038,662, \"Method for Producing a Shell of relativistic Particles at an Altitude Above the Earth's Surface,\" patent number 4,712,155, \"Method and Apparatus for Creating an Artificial El ectron Cyclotron Region of Plasma.\" But 149"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica patent number 4,686,605 interests us most.

The region is excited by electron cyclotron resonance heating to thereby in crease its charged particle density. In one embodiment, circularly-polarized el ectromagnetic radiat ion is transmitted upward in a direction substantially parallel to and along a field line which extends through the region of plasma to be altered.... This increase in energy can cause ionization of neutral particles which are men absorbed as part of the region, thereby increasing the charged pa rticle density of the region. 64 But what practical application would such heating accomplish? The patent speaks for itself: disrupti on of land, airborne, sea a nd surface and sub-surface communications, missile or aircraft de struction, deflectio n, or confusion, weather modification, and, since HAARP broadcasts within the frequency of the human brain, behavior modification. 65 By heating a portion of the earth's ionosphere and building up a massive charge above a certain region, a threshold of instability would be obtained, an electrical potential differe ntial between the region of particles above the earth, and the earth's surface itself.

A weaponized technology is being created that is substantially unified That is, one inst allation can be used for a variety of communications, defensive, or offensive military purposes. The hardware of the installation does not change. Rather, its harmonics are adjusted to accomplish whatever purpose is desired at the moment. (5) The Philadelphia Experiment The Philadelphia Experiment has about it the stuff of legends. Four prominent American physicists were said to be involved: Thomas Townsend Brown, John von Neumann, Albert Einste in, and Nikola Tesla. Allegedly, the experiment took place in 1943 on the DE (destroyer es cort) USS Eldridge in the Philadelphia navy yard. To understand it, we need to recall that at the beginning of World War Two, the Germ an navy used underwater magnetic mines and torpedoes that were attract ed to the magnetic field generated by large metal ships. The mines would literally be attracted to the hulls of Allied ships, explode, and sink them. The Allies quickly learned how to counter these devices through a technique called \"degaussing.\" A large el ectrical coil began to be fitted around the outside hull of ships, through which a current was passed that was exactly out of phase with the magnetic re sonance of the ship. But here is the clincher. Since the ships themselves moved through and in the earth's magnetic field, and this varied minut ely from place to place, the harmonic resonance of any individual ship also va ried as it moved from one place to another. Thus, the resonan ce in the degaussing coils on the ships had to be monitored and constantly adjusted at all times to make sure that the ship was not \"magnetically visible\" to the Germ an mines and torpedoes. The slightest imperfection in this resonance would leave a large magnetic signature, and the ship would be \"visible.\" The experience with degaussing suggested a bolder defense. Einstein had already published his theory of Genera l Relativity, which maintained light could be bent in a strong gravitational field, 151"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica and he was working on a \"Unified Fi eld Theory\" which would explain both electromagnetic and gravitational energy. If ships could be made magnetically invisible, could they not also be made invisible to radar? Thus was born the Philadelphia Expe riment. Using not one, but three coils around each axis of the ship, and adjusted to be in phase with one another, the idea was to create a ro tating electromagnetic field around the ship that would l iterally bend a radar signal around the sh ip altogether. The signal would flash by the ship without a return to the German radar sets, and the German operators would conclude no ship was there. The experiment makes rational sense in wartime America, with the invasion of Europe impending. What is actually alleged to have happened, however, was more than the scientists bargained for, regardless of which versi on of the story one reads. When the coils were turned on and the field was established, immediately there was a loud electrostat ic \"buzz\" in the air, and a green mist soon surrounded the ship. This point actually se rves to substantiate what happened next, for this green mist many will recognize as simply the ionization of normal air that takes place in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. Anyone familiar with tornadic thundersto rms in the American midwest will recognize this peculiar green color of ionized atmosphere that precedes a violent storm. Once the green mist lifted, however, th e ship was not just invisible to American radar operators, it was invisible to the naked eye. In one version of the story, all that one could see was th e outline of the hull in the water. In another version, the ship was simply to tally gone, having reappeared some hundreds of miles away in a cloud of gr een mist before the confused British captain of an aircraft carrier, who made a note of it in his log. The story takes an even stranger tu rn when the field was turned off. Nearly every account of the experiment st ates that the crew of the ship who were outside on the decks felt an overwhelming electrostatic pressure pressing against them, a phenomenon similar to what Tesla recorded in his high frequency direct current impulse 152"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star experiments. But more importantly, several crewmembers were embedded in bulkheads and various surfaces of the sh ip, their bodies parts inexplicably fused with the metal of the ship in some grizzly sort of organo-metallic nightmare. Some crewmembers simply had to be put out of their misery, and others lost limbs. This led the project's alleged superv isor, John von Neumann, back to the drawing boards to figure out what went wrong. Before turning to that, we note another important set of clues: i onized plasma, electrostatic pressure fields, and a \"bubble\" of invisibility. (6) Montauk and von Neumann's Time Locks John von Neumann, so the story goes, we nt back to the drawing board to figure out why the Philadelphia Experiment was simultaneously to stupendously successful and such a colo ssal failure. Von Neumann allegedly concluded that by utilizing such massive rotating electrostatic fields that the ship and its crew had somehow been \"t eleported\" into an alternative space- time and come back again, with the result that some of the men did not come back as \"in phase\" as they had left, hence their embedding in bulkheads and decks. The version of the Philadelphia E xperiment that interests us here is that given by \"Commander X\": Four (of the crew) who had moved from their original position wound up in the steel deck. While the ship's fields were up there was no problem. When the fields collapsed and their time lo cks were gone, if they ha d, unfortunately, changed position, drifted and rematerializ ed in our dimension...at a slightly different place or were unfortunate enough to be where the steel deck was, the steel of the deck literally melded with the molecules of their body.... Now, the question was, what do you do to prevent it? The problem entailed understanding, which von Neumann had to go back and do, basic meta physics. Can you imagine a hardheaded Dutchman 66 steeped in mathematics and with a particularly tough materialistic mind 66 Von Neumann was actually Hungarian. 153"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica suddenly having to approach metaphys ics? ... Nevertheless he did his homework. And he found the problem. 67 What was this solution? \"Commander X\" calls them \"time locks.\" Every human being that is born on this pl anet, actually from the time of conception on, has what is called a set of time locks. The soul is lo cked to that point in the stream of time...so everything flows forwar d at a normal rate of flow at the time function.... These locks stay with you your entire life. 68 While \"Commander X\" is not very clea r, he seems to be saying that the geometrical configuration of the system into which one is born - a by-gone age would have called it your Zodiaca l \"sun sign\" - somehow creates a \"temporal harmonic\" within each pe rson with that configuration, an interpretation that would seem to be born out by his suggestion that the crew of the Eldridge that had moved out of their original position were in danger once the field was turned off. A field th at literally bends light sufficiently to make an entire ship invisible can be looked at another wa y, since it might equally have been intense enough to send the ship into a space not in phase with our own. If one moves as it is coming back into our own space, one might, indeed, find oneself embedded in a bulkhead. But for all that, if this was von Neumann's actual solution to the problem, then it has all the hallmarks of astr ology. However, so did an RCA study of sunspots in the 1950s. 67 Commander X, The Philadelphia Experiment Chronicles: Exploring the Strange Case of Alfred Bielek and Dr. M.K.

And what he discovered astonished both the RCA company and the scientific world. In an article entitled \"Planetary Position Effects on Short-Wave Signal Quality,\" Nelson released the results of his study. To his surprise Nelson soon specifically correlated this rising and falling radio interference with not only (Sic.) sunspot cycle, but with the solar system: he found, to his increasing asto nishment, a very repeatable - in essence, astrological correlation - be tween the inexorable orbits of all the planets (but especially Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - which, remember, hold essentially all the solar's (Sic.) system's known angular momentum)...and major radio-disturbing eruptions on the Sun! ...In essence what John Nelson had rediscovered was nothing short of ...the ultimate, very ancient, now highly demonstrable andular momentum foundations behind the real influences of the Son and planets on our lives. 69 I. Some Conclusions: Gathering all these th oughts together, one can glean some of the speculative principles on which the Great Pyramid might have functioned as a weapon. (1) With the proper type of interference with the waveform of those objects, i.e., with the proper harmon ics, a destructive interference can be established that will simply \"cancel out\" or nullify the objects themselves. That is, on one view of quantum mechanics, interference can be established in 69 Richard C. Hoagland, \"Hubble's New Runaway Planet-Part III,' (www.enterprisemission.com), July 18, 1999, p.2. 155"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica an object causing all its particles to again take all paths; the object will simply appear to disintegrate in a violent cataclysm of all forms of energy. (2) If the inertial and electromagnetic processes of the heavens are somehow captured, i.e., if one can couple to them, then as Lerner stated, \"fusion devices more powerful than those now in existence will operate.\" (3) The cellular structure of the cosmos suggested by plasma cosmology and by the \"living\" universe of pa leophysics suggests when something happens in one locality, the whole reacts but means of some mechanism not yet adequately comprehended. But how is this possible? Bell's theorem demonstrated that reality is non-local. If one assumes the existence of an aether, as a \"field of information\", it is rather easy to see how what happens in one \"cell\" of th e universe is quickly transmitted to another, for all the cells are \"entangled \" or \"coupled\" to each other. There as thus as yet inadequately compre hended laws of harmonics that would appear to be scale invariant, and these laws would seem to indicate a unification of the various fields of physics. (4) As we know by now, however, every object has a frequency that it vibrates or resonates to. Thus, if one knew th e frequency of any material, with proper \"phase conjugation\" of energy, one could conceivably initiate a nuclear reaction by loading enough vibrations into it, by causing it, in other words, to vibrate or \"cav itate\" violently enough to explode. (5) Finally, we encountered the idea of the phase-conjugate mirror, which collects the split beams and fires them on to the target in such a way that all beams are not only time-reversed but so that they arrive at target at the same time and exactly in phase with each other. The time-reversed component is essential because, it will be recalled, it mean s that the beams do not suffer the effect of dissipation due to the inverse square law. These waves would arrive at the target an d set up a \"standing wave\" inside it, rather like a 156"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star sound wave, causing it to vibrate in lo ck step with the incoming pulses of energy. Eventually, the energy locked inside the target would cross a threshold of stability, and it would bl ow itself apart in a nuclear reaction regardless of the material that comprised the target. In this respect, the Great Pyramid might have constituted a gigantic and super-sophisticated \"phase conjugate mirror,\" picking up the incoming inertial vibrations of the aether as they have been \"split\" into the acoustic, electromagnetic, nuclear and gravitationa l vibrations of the earth, the solar system, and the Milky Way Galaxy, and modulating its output energy by the same vibrations in a deadly carrier wa ve of unheard of destructive potential. In chapters five and six, we will presen t evidence that suggests that this type of phase conjugation may very well have been the function of three of its better-known internal chambers. As we also discovered, this idea ha s an important, and often over-looked, corollary. During the first hydrogen bomb tests, the actual energy yield of the bombs far exceeded those initially calcu lated. There was an \"x\" factor, an unknown source of surplus energy that was being tapped. Since hydrogen bombs unleash enormous amounts of de structive energy at the very sub- atomic level of the nucleus of atoms, we may also surmise, in part, where that energy came from and why, for such w eapons literally cause a violent local disturbance in the geometry and fabric of space-time. In short, some as yet inadequately understood laws of ha rmonics produced the excess energy. Thus, it might be possible to indu ce stable endothermic or cold fusion reactions at much lower levels of energy input than previously thought possible dnd it is possible to do so by ordinary elect romagnetic means. It is a short step to the conclusion that it is also possible to induce unstable thermonuclear reactions by a similar method. 157"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica This led us to a bold conjecture on the possible weaponization of such a phenomenon. â€¢ Every object or material substa nce has a resonant frequency. â€¢ Sound waves that are resonant to that frequency can be amplified. â€¢ Once amplified, they can be projected and accelerated to that object by electromagnetic forces - rather like a radio wave carries, or is \"modulated\" by acoustic information. â€¢ Once the carrier electromagnetic wave reaches the target, the acoustic energy enters inside of the target, resonating harmonically with it, and loading energy into it. â€¢ The threshold of instability is reached and the target is disrupted at the sub-atomic level by breaking down the bond between the sub-atomic particles. â€¢ It is most effective if th e carrier beam as well as its acoustic modulation is itself resonant with the target. If one now recalls all th at has been said thus far about phase conjugate mirrors, the coupling of non-local system s and the various forms of energy - gravitational, acoustic, electromagne tic - as well as time-reversed phase conjugation, and engineers these compone nts together, one comes very close to an understanding of the awesome weapon the Great Pyramid was, and how it worked, for as we shall discover in chapter five, not only did it have an electromagnetic cohered output in the form of a maser, but also very likely an acoustic amplification and modulation of that output. One may speak of it as being a phase-conjugate elec tro-acoustic \"howitzer.\" Selecting the region is simple: one merely configures the antennae to be sufficiently out of phase to guide the interference signal to the point above the planet's surface one wishes to \"heat \".

Certainly the oldest re ligious traditions all bear witness to a catastrophic inundation of the world that was due to the wickedness of humanity. So what remains is to discover whether or not the Pyramid coupled such energies together via the principle of a coupled harmonic oscillator. If so, then one should expect to encounter, at some point or points in its design, the following features: â€¢ A coupling to inertial or gravit ational phenomena, such as the wobbling of the earth via the pr ecession of the equinoxes, the center of galactic mass, and so on. â€¢ A coupling to electromagnetic phenomena, such as the mean temperature of the earth, the velocity of light, and so on. â€¢ A coupling to the fundamental mathematical and physical constants. â€¢ A coupling to fundamental ac oustical energy, such as the Schumann resonance of the, earth, and so on. â€¢ Evidence of a coupling to, or use of, cohered electromagnetic energy (lasers, masers, etc). â€¢ Evidence of a coupling to, or use of, nuclear energy. 159"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"De Physica Esoterica â€¢ Evidence of coupling to the primary differential of paleophysics, time, in such a way as to indicate a fundamental reference time, or \"base time\" or \"time lock.

Notice the fragment of what most archaeologists call a \"causeway\" leading away to the east-northeast. Note that if one extends the causeway to the Great Pyramid itself, it appears to intersect at the center or just to the south of the center of th e eastern parabolic face. Below and to the left of the Great Pyramid we find the second Pyramid, the other dominant structure at Giza. Notably, in Piazzi Smith's drawing which is reproduced here, it too appears to have slightly parabolic faces, though not as pronounced as the Great Pyra mid. This may or may not be an inaccuracy in the drawing; neverthele ss, it is good to point it out, as some researcher may undertake to survey that pyramid as accurately as the Great pyramid. Notice that to th e right of the Second Pyramid one finds a \"temple\", with the traces of yet another \"causeway\" extending to the east southeast past the Sphinx to a granite 'temple.\" Finally, in the lower left-hand corner of the diagram, one finds the Third Pyramid, the smallest of the three large pyramids at Giza. Again, one notes the peculiar feature in Piazzi Smith's drawing that it too appears to have \"parabolic\" faces, and, like the other two pyramids, a \"causeway\" leading almost due east. Immediately south of the Third Pyramid are the fourth, fifth, and sixth pyramids, structures of ev idently inferior construction when compared with the first three. Now let us note one feature unique to the Great Pyramid. In thousands of years, this massive building has settled less than half an inch, in spite of numerous earthquakes in the region. Sin ce Petrie's comprehensive survey of Giza, engineers have known 162"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star why. Beneath the Great Pyramid there are five massive stones or \"sockets\", four at each corner of the structure, and a fifth on the diagonal above the southeast corner (Cf. Figure Two).

This is the surest evidence, in and of itself, that the Great Pyramid is a coupled oscillat or, for this feature is analogous to pressing down a key of a piano silently while striking another key to make it resonate freely. The Pyramid, in short, was designed to move. Figure Two: The Five Sockets of the Base of the Great Pyramid If one now looks at a North-South cr oss section of the Great Pyramid, one is immediately confronted by an anomal y, as far as the pyramids at Giza go, for alone of all the pyramids there, the Great Pyramid has internal chambers above the ground line in addition to a subt erranean chamber (Figure Three).

Yet another anomalous feature. Note also the layers or stone courses of the Pyramid, an important feature that we will discuss in more detail in chapter six. Now let us look a little closer at each of these chambers, beginning with the Grand Gallery. In terms of sheer size, this is the largest of the interior chambers of the Great Pyramid, and it has a number of unusual features (cf. Figure Three). Along each side of the Ga llery, there is a narrow flat section, into which twenty-seven notches are cut at equal distances on each side.

Figure Four: The End of the Grand Gallery, The Antechamber, King's Chamber, and Coffer. Before we enter the King's Chamber, there are a number of peculiar things we must observe in the Antechamber.

L ooking again at Figures Four and Five, you will also note, on each side of the Antechamber behind the slab, three large slots, at the top of which are th ree semi-circular notches. This feature has led some to speculate that at one time there were three movable slabs of rock set into these notches which could be raised or lowered rather like a portcullis. As we shall see, Christopher Dunn has a most ingenious explanation of what purpose these notc hes and the portcullis may once have served. Continuing our journey into the King's Chamber itself, we find the Coffer with its \"melted\" corner lying toward the western wall of the Chamber (cf. Figures Eight and Nine). Looking at the north-south cross section of the King's Chamber (Figure Nine), we discove r five layers of very large granite slabs, with flat bottoms but very roughly carved tops, ye t another seeming anomaly in a structure so perfectly constructed. Looking for a moment longer, we discover in the three upperm ost chambers the only hieroglyphics ever found inside the Great Pyramid, and found in a most unlikely place, namely, not in the chamber that is supposed to contain the actual sarcophagus, the Coffer. 2 If one looks at the east-west cross section (Figure Eight), one notes that the large granite stones comprising the roofs of the five chambers above the King's Chamber are all vertically cant ilevered.

A Mathematical and Physical Survey (1) Universal Geometric, Mathematical, and Physical Properties Now let us leave aside, until the next chapter, our physical journey, and note some of the more prominent math ematical and physical facts about the Great Pyramid. The first, and perhaps most unusual, feature of the structure is that it appears to embody a system of measure very much like our English system of measurement. The so-called \"pyramid inch\" or PI is equal to 1.0011 of our present American in ches and 1.0010846752 British inches. 3 Equally as strange is the man who is credited with this discovery. It was Sir Isaac Newton who found that \"many of the measurements of the pyramid would be in whole numbers if th is unit (or measure) were used.\" 4 It becomes much more anomalous. For example, if one measures the perimeter of the base of the Pyramid and divides it by twice the height, one will get a result approximating the value of PI to five decimal places. 5 This is significant, for it means that long before the Greeks \"discovered\" PI, the paleoancient builders of the Pyramid already knew about it. Perhaps the Greeks merely rediscovered it, or perhaps were allowed to publicize it. The high strangeness of it all only accumulates. For example, if one computes the ratio of the apothem (the face slant to height) to half the length of a base of the Pyramid, one obtains ye t another mathematical constant, that of PHI, which has a theoretical value of 1.61818.... PHI, as mathematicians and physicists know, has some rather remarkable properties of its own. If one adds 1 to PHI, on e will discover that l+PHI = PHI 2 . Likewise, 1+1/PHI=PHI. PHI is also the basis for 3 Rodolfo Benavides, Dramatic Prophecies in the Great Pyramid (1974), p. 2. The best compilation of the mathematical and physical properties is that of Mr. Tim G.

But it doesn't stop there. The Pythagorean relationship represented by a 3- 4-5 right triangle can be found in the di mensions of the King's Chamber. The east wall's diagonal is 309\", its length is 412\", and its long central diagonal is 515\". Here again, whoever built the Great Pyramid anticipated the Greeks by several thousands of years, for the Pythagoreans are not credited with the discovery until about 495 BC. 8 The most extraordinary mathematical and physical constant of them all, however, is the fact that Gaussian c onstant of gravitation (k) is expressed trigonometrically as ''the reciprocal of the distance between the Coffer and the north or south wall of the King's Chambe r, minus one ten-billionth the bottom perimeter of the Coffer....

We simply do not know. The point is that alignments at certain periods with certain featur es of the Pyramid are an insufficient basis to date its building. However, we may point out that such a celestial and zodiacal alignment does link the Pyramid with a c onstellation subsequent astrological lore associates with death. In that sense, too, it is a death st ar, for it is aligned with the death star, Orion. The length of a base side of the Pyramid is 9131 pyramid inches. But expressed in yet another peculiar \"pyr amid\" unit of measure, the \"pyramid cubit\", the length is exactly 365.24 cubits, exactly the numbe r of days in a terrestrial year. 11 Each base side of the Pyrami d, in other words, is an exact temporal measure coupling to the time it takes for the earth to complete one revolution in its orbit around the sun. This isn't all, for it was also built to indicate exactly when the earth would pass through its solstices and equinoxes, 12 and, at exactly noon during the spring equinox, due to the precise angles of its faces, it ca sts no shadow whatsoever. 13 It is also built in a ratio of the mean distance of the earth to the sun, for its height times 10 9 equals the mean radius of the earth's orbit of the earth around the sun, the basic astronomi cal unit. Likewise, if one doubles the perimeter of the bottom of the Coffer, and multiplies it by 10 8 , one obtains the mean distance to the moon. 15 One may also find the ratio of the sun's radius expressed as a function of the measure of the perimeter of the Coffer, as well as another peculiar ratio. \"The pyramid embodies a scale ratio of 1/43200.

The e xposure curve of radiation for the stones would, in that case, make sense. Moreover, exposure to such intense radiation would in fact dist ort carbon-14 dating of the Pyramid's mortar, making it appear far younger than it in fact may be. 18 Benavides, op. cit., p. 22. 19 Bauvall and Gilbert, op. cit., p. 124. 177"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"A Quick Tour (3) Terrestrial Properties and Alignments The mean density of the earth is approximately 5.7 times that of water at 68 degrees Fahrenheit at a barometric pressure of 30 pounds per inch.

The Machine Hypothesis \"A credible theory woul d have to explain... \" Christopher Dunn, The Giza Power Plant A. A Credible Theory Author and engineer Christopher Dunn proposes the most lucid account of the machine hypothesis in his book The Giza Power Plant. This crucial book in the growing literature on the Gr eat Pyramid can only be summarized here, but every effort will be made to cite Dunn's actual words. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that this is only a summary of his work, and no summary can substitute for a careful study of his illuminating and important analysis. For Dunn, any credible theory about the Great Pyramid would have to account for the following anomalous facts: â€¢ The selection of granite as the building material for the King's Chamber. It is evident that in choosing granite, the builders took upon themselves an extremely difficult task. â€¢ The presence of four superfl uous chambers above the King's Chamber. â€¢ The characteristics of the giant gran ite monoliths that were used to separate these so-called \"construction chambers.\" â€¢ The presence of exuviae, or the cast-o ff shells of insects, that coated the chamber above the King's Chamber, turning those who entered black. â€¢ The violent disturbance in the King's Chamber that expanded its walls and cracked the beams in its ceilin g but left the rest of the Great Pyramid seemingly undisturbed. â€¢ The fact that the guardians were able to detect the di sturbance inside the King's Chamber, when there was little or no exterior evidence of it. â€¢ The reason the guardians thought it necessary to smear the cracks in the ceiling of the King's Chamber with cement. â€¢ The fact that two shafts connect the King's Chamber to the outside. 180"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star â€¢ The design logic for these two sh afts - their func tion, dimensions, features, and so forth. Any theory offered for serious co nsideration concerning the Great Pyramid also would have to provide logical reasons for all the anomalies we have already discussed and several we soon will examine, including: â€¢ The antechamber â€¢ The Grand Gallery, with its corbeled walls and steep incline. â€¢ The Ascending Passage, with its enigmatic granite barriers. â€¢ The Well Shaft down to the Subterranean Pit. â€¢ The salt encrustations on the walls of the Queen's Chamber. â€¢ The rough, unfinished floor inside the Queen's Chamber. â€¢ The corbeled niche cut into the east wall of the Queen's Chamber. â€¢ The shafts that originally were not fully connect to the Queen's Chamber. â€¢ The copper fittings discovered by Rudolph Gantenbrink in 1993. â€¢ The green stone ball, grapnel hook, and cedar-like wood found in the Queens' Chamber shafts. â€¢ The plaster of paris that oozed ou t of the joints made inside the shafts. â€¢ The repugnant odor that assailed early explorers.' While Dunn's work admirably fulfills these criteria, there are nevertheless some omissions from this list that must be accounted for as well. What was all this engineering designed to do? Dunn' s answer is obvious from the title of his work: it was to produ ce power. But power for what? As has been demonstrated, there are several facts maintained in ancient texts and traditions that are immediatel y relevant to a proper understanding of the machine hypothesis, all of them mo re or less answering \"What kind of machine was it?\" Any credible theory must therefore also explain the following additional factors, explored in chapters two, three, and four, in addition to Mr. Dunn's list: 1 Christopher Dunn, The Giza Power Plant: T echnologies of Ancient Egypt (Santa Fe, New Mexico: Bear and Company Publishing, 1998), pp. 46-47. 181"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Machine Hypothesis â€¢ The consistent and pervasive religi ous tradition in Egypt associating the compound with Zodiacal symbols associated with death and immortality. â€¢ The ancient texts, traditions, and archaeological sites consistent with the use of advanced weapons system s of mass destruction that were mentioned in chapters 2, 3, and 4. â€¢ The ancient texts and traditions that indicated the one-time existence of a very advanced theoretical physics. â€¢ The ancient texts that indicate the Great Pyramid was a weapon. â€¢ The possible relationship of the Grea t Pyramid to the other structures of Giza in the performance of that function. 2 Since so much of the weapons hypothes is is related to Dunn's work, the basic functions of the physical features of the Great Pyramid in his model will be summarized here before exploring how they may or may not relate to the weapon hypothesis in chapter six. Dunn's hypothesis will be summarized here in more or less the order he himself develops it. B. Extremely Close Tolerances and Some Provocative Questions Engineers who have studied the Great Pyramid consistently come away amazed, and utterly baffled by its unusua lly close tolerances. Indeed, notes Dunn, it was this factor that compelle d his interest in the structure. Here was a prehistoric monument that was constructed with such precision that you could not find a comparable modern building. More remarkable to me was that the builders evidently found it necessary to 2 As we shall discover, Dunn alone, of all the literature on the subject, proposes a purely functional purpose to some of the other pyramids at Giza. 182"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star maintain a standard of precision that can be found today in machine s hops, but certainly not on building sites. 3 But why were such tolerances necessa ry for a building that was designed principally as a religious tomb and/or astronomical observatory? Why have such tolerances at all? And how were they achieved? 4 Dunn's answer does not require the reader to subscribe to th e dubious notion that the whole structure was built to such tolerances to ensure the Pharaoh's immortality. I consider two possible alternative answers. First, the building was for some reason required to conform to precise specifications regarding its dimensions, geometric proportions, and its mass. As with a modern optician's product, any variation from these specifications would severely diminish its primary function In order to comply with these specifications, therefore, greater care than usual was taken in manufacturing and constructing this edifice. Second, th e builders of the Great Pyramid were highly evolved in their building sk ills and possessed greatly advanced instruments and tools. The accuracy of the pyramid was normal to them, and perhaps their tools were not capable of producing anything less than this superb accuracy, which ha s astounded many over the years. Consider, for example, that the mo dern machines th at produce many of the components that support out civilization are so finely engineered that the most inferior piece they could turn out is more accurate than what was the norm for those produ ced one hundred years ago. In engineering, the state of the art inevitably moves forward. 5 These two provocative observations requi re some comment, beginning with Dunn's idea that the extreme tolerances may just be th e coincidental effect of a society possessed of a highly de veloped skill in engineering. And that is the point. If such skills exceed the capacity of our own most advanced construction capab ilities, then one is dealing with a civilization more advanced than our own. And as will be seen in chapter six, the most pervasive employment of such 3 Dunn, op. cit. p. 51. 4 Dunn, op. cit., p. 56. 5 Ibid., p. 64, emphasis added. 183"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Machine Hypothesis construction tolerances in our own so ciety is often in connection with military projects or extremely advanced optics, often both. The second point is this: if thes e extremely close tolerances were necessary to the pr oper functioning of the structur e, then one is faced with something of an anomaly for which no contemporary analogy actually exists, and so one is left to make educat ed conjectures. Our own contemporary notions of power and energy would not seem to require such close tolerances for the construction of a mere power pl ant, unless the paleoancient notion of power and energy was fundamentally diffe rent than our own, based on a kind of unified field physics that was practical and testable, a goal that we have not yet achieved. Indeed, Dunn never satisf actorily explicitly explains the necessity for such close tolerances in a mere \"power plant.\" However, this is not a deficit to his work, as he is concerned not so much with conjecture, but merely the evidence that the Pyramid was a type of machine involving enormous power output. C. Advanced Machining and Ultra-Sonic Drilling One of the most provoca tive and most thorough c onsiderations of the advanced technology used in the Great Pyramid is Dunn's discussion of the evidence of advanced machining in the building. 6 In this respect, his analysis of the Coffer in the King's Chamber is the most anomalous of all the evidence for a sophisticated technology exceedi ng our own contemporary abilities. Along with the evidence on the outside of the King' s Chamber coffer, we find further evidence of the use of high-speed machine tools on the inside of the granite coffer. The methods that were evidently used by the pyramid builders to hollow out the inside of the granite coffers are simi lar to the methods that would be used to machine out the inside of components to day. Tool marks on the coffer's inside indicate that when the gr anite was hollow out, worker s made preliminary roughing cuts by drilling holes into th e granite around the area that was to be removed. 7 6 Dunn, op. cit., pp. 67-91. 7 Ibid., pp. 79-80. 184"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star 185"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" The fact that the inside of the Coffer appears to have been drilled was one of the most anomalous facts noted by the famous nineteenth century pyramidologist, Sir William Flinders Petrie. To an engineer in the 1880s, what Petrie was looking at was an anomaly. The characteristics of the holes , the cores that came out of them, and the tools marks would be an impo ssibility according to any conventional theory of ancient Egyptian craftsma nship, even with the technology available in Petrie's da y. Three distinct characteristics of the hole and core...make the artifacts extremely remarkable: â€¢ A taper on both the hole and the core. â€¢ A symmetrical helical groove following these tapers showing that the drill advanced into the granite at a feedrate of .10 inch per revolution of the drill. â€¢ The confounding fact that the spir al groove cut deeper through the quartz than through the softer feldspar. 8 But in 100 years, as technology has advanced, the anomaly has deepened: In conventional machining the revers e would be the case. In 1983 Donald Rahn of Rahn Granite Surface plate Co. told me that diamond drills, rotating at nine hundred revolutions per minute, penetrate granite 8 Dunn, op. cit., p. 84. 186 The Machine H yp othesis Dunn then reproduces the following figure:"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star at the rate f one inch in five minute s. In 1996, Eric Leither of Tru-Stone Corp. told me that these parameters have not changed since then. The feedrate of modem drills, therefore, calculates to be .0002 inch per revolution, indicating that the ancien t Egyptians drilled into granite with a feedrate that was five hundred times grea ter or deeper per revolution of the drill than modern dril ls! The other characteristic s of the artifacts also pose a problem for modern drills. Somehow the Egyptians made a tapered hole with a spiral groove that was cut deeper through the harder constituent of the granite. If conventional machining methods cannot answer just one of these questions, how do we answer all three? 9 Dunn's answer explains the advanced drilling technique used to hollow out the Coffer, but in the process, only va lidates the existence of an extremely sophisticated technology in paleoancient times. In contrast, ultrasonic drilling fully explains how the hole s and cores found in Valley Temple at Giza could ha ve been cut, and it is capable of creating all the details that Petrie and I puzzled over. Unfortunately for Petrie, ultrasonic drilling was unknown at th e time he made his studies, so it is not surprising that he could not find satisfactory answers to his queries. In my opinion, the application of ultrasonic machining is the only method that completely satisfies l ogic, from a technical viewpoint. Ultrasonic machining is the oscillatory motion of a tool that chips away material, like a jackhammer chipping away at a piece of concrete pavement, except much fester and not as measurable in its reciprocation. The ultrasonic tool bit, vibrating at 19,000- to 25,000-cycles-per-second (hertz), has found unique applica tion in the precision machining of odd-shaped holes in hard, brittle material such as hardened steels, carbides, ceramics, and semiconductors. An abrasive slurry or paste is used to accelerate the cutting action. The most significant detail of the drilled holes and cores studied by Petrie was that the groove was cut deeper through the quartz than through the feldspar. Quartz crystals are employed in the production of ultrasonic sound and, conversely, are re sponsive to the influence of vibration in the ultrasonic ranges and can be induced to vibrate at high frequency. When machining granite using u ltrasonics, the harder ma terial (quartz) would not necessarily offer more resistance, as it 9 Dunn, op. cit., p. 84. 187"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Machine Hypothesis would during conventional machini ng practices. An ultrasonically vibrating tool bit w ould find numerous sympathetic partners, while cutting through granite, embedded right in the granite itself. Instead of resisting the cutting action, the quartz would be induced to respond and vibrate in sympathy with the high- frequency waves and amplify the abrasive action as th e tool cut through it. 10 An amazing anomaly indeed, for if ultrasonic drilling is a machining technique found only at the end of the twentieth century, then this would seem to imply that the palaeoancient Very High Civilization achieved at least a similar level of technological and sc ientific sophistication to our own. Finally, there are two othe r facts about the Coffer that must be mentioned. First, the Coffer is one solid block of granite that has been hollowed out, probably either with ultrasonic drilling or with some technique as yet still unknown to us. And this raises a question: why, if the Coffer was meant to be a sarcophagus, why was it necessary for its builders to go through the extra complication of machining it in this fashion? Why not build it out of several pieces, as the Egyptians were known to do in other instances? 11 Second, the Coffer is a precisely machined object, not showing the slightest imperfection, which means that it was constructed in side the King's Chamber. Its builders intended for it to be precise for some as yet unknown reason. They had gone to the trouble to take the unfinished product into the tunnel and finish it underground fo r a good reason. It is th e logical thing to do if you require a high degree of precision in the piece that you (Sic.) are working. To finish it with such precision at a site that maintained a different atmosphere and a different temperatur e, such as in th e open under the hot sun, would mean that when it was finally installed in the cool, cavelike temperatures of the tunnel, the workpiece would lose precision. Tne solution then as now, of course, was to prepare precision objects in a location that had the same heat and humidity in which they were going to be housed. 12 10 Dunn, op. cit., p. 87. 11 Ibid., p. 95. 12 Ibid., p. 97. 188"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star As has been seen, the Great Pyramid' s builders so constructed the Pyramid that the King's Chamber maintains a te mperature that is very close to the mean thermal gradient of the earth. D. How it Worked Dunn's analysis of the chambers a nd passages of the Great Pyramid and their possible functions simply cannot be bested. It is the most comprehensive survey of their potentialities based upon known science and currently existing technology, and therefore what follows is but a crude summary of Dunn's excellent work. It is crucial to the basis of our speculations in the next chapter, so some detailed understandi ng of Dunn's hypothesis is essential. 1. Missing Components a nd Many Possible Solutions In addition to the advanced machining that so mystified Petrie, Dunn points out that the de sign of the inner chambers and passageways of the Great Pyramid seem to connote some purely functional purpose ha ving little to do with the death-resurrection-Osiris mythology of ancient Egypt. \"I became convinced that I was looking at the prin ts for an extremely large machine, except this machine had been relieve d of its inner components for some inexplicable reason.\" 13 This remark is truly as tonishing, for nowhere in Dunn's work is any reference made to the ancient texts cited by Zechariah Sitchin that indicate that components were indeed removed from the Great Pyramid - some to be forever dest royed - by the victors in the \"Second Pyramid War.\" Indeed, nowhere does Dunn re fer to Sitchin's work at all. His approach, as an engineer simply examining the evidence the Pyramid presents, is to extrapolate from th at evidence and known engineering and scientific principles the possible functi on of the Pyramid. On that basis, he concluded, \"something is missing,\" corr oborating apparently independently the ancient texts cited by Sitchin. 13 Dunn, op. cit, p. 122, emphasis added. 189"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Machine Hypothesis But what kind of machine? Dunn ma intains an open mind: \"In proposing my theory that the Great Pyramid is a power plant, I am not adamantly adhering to any one proposition. The possibilities may be numerous. However, the main facts ar e inescapable, for they were noted many years ago, and it would be impossible for an open-minded, logically thinking person to disregard them.\" 14 If Dunn does not go all the way to the weapon hypothesis, he does allude to a potentially destru ctive use of the technology behind the Great Pyramid if not of the structure itself. 15 2. Some Elementary Physics: Coup led Harmonic Oscillators and Damping The principle of a coupled harmonic oscillator in resonance to some fundamental \"can unleash an awesome and destructive power.\" 16 The earth, as any college general science textbook will explain, is both a source of tremendous mechanical energy as well as of electro-magnetic energy, witness the enormous power unleashed in an earthquake or a thunder storm. Normally, mechanical and electromagnetic energy propagates in two kinds of waves, transverse \"S\" waves and longitudinal \"P\" waves. \"Primary or compressional waves (P waves) send particles osci llating back and forth in the same direction 17 as the waves are travelling. Sec ondary or transverse shear waves (S Waves) oscillate perpe ndicular to their direction of travel. P waves always travel at higher velocities than S waves and are the first to be recorded by a seismograph.\" 14 Dunn, op. cit., p. 123. 15 Ibid., pp. 243-245. 16 Ibid., p. 136. It should go without saying that the basic principle of resonance, as stated here, implies a potential for weaponization. 17 The term \"direction\" may be misleading to some. What Dunn meant to say is \"the same axis\". 18 Dunn, op. cit., p. 126. The \"wave- particle\" duality of current quantum mechanics and light theory is well known, but perhaps the \"duality\" is itself not properly understood, or at least, referred to in the scientific literature. Perhaps the duality is best expressed as the transverse-longitudinal wave duality. This 190"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" Transverse (S) Wave and Longitudinal (P) Wave This relationship between mechanical , or acoustic types of waves, and electromagnetic waves, is deeply myst erious, but yet, is a commonplace that most people are familiar w ith. Dunn puts it this way: Turn on any motor or generator and yo u can hear the energy at work: the motor/generator will hum as it revolves. This hum is associated with the energy itself and not so much the move ments of the rotor through the air. This phenomenon is evident when a moto r stalls when the power is still turned on. When too great a load is put on a motor, and the motor stalls, the hum will become louder. The electrical and ma gnetic forces in the motor generate the sound waves. The earth itself, as a giant dynamo, produces similar sound waves.... Collectively form of stating the duality would thus seem to issue in a paradox: a photon of light would arrive at an observer before its detection ;or measurement by that obse rver. This would seem to suggest that recent experi ments in \"superluminal\" phenom ena might be being improperly interpreted: electromagnetic phenomena are \"superluminal\" but the observable phenomena are luminal and their wave characteristics are dependent upon the geometric configurations of the total system. 191 The Giza Death Sta r"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The Machine Hypothesis known as an electromagnetic 'cavity,' the elements that make it up are the Earth, the ionosphere, the troposphere, and the magnetosphere. The fundamental frequency of the vibrations is calculated to be 7.83 hertz, with overlaying frequencies of 14, 20, 26, 32, 37, and 43 hertz.... The Earth's energy includes mechanical, thermal, electrical, magnetic, nuclear, and chemical action, each a source for sound. It would follow, therefore, that the energy at work in the Earth would generate sound waves that would be related to the particular vibration of the energy creating it and the material through which it passes. 19 3. Piezo-Electric Effect But why use granite, one of the most difficult materials to work with, in constructing the Pyramid? Very simple, says Dunn. Granite is composed of billions of tiny quartz crystals suspended in the surrounding rock. Thus, if one stresses the granite, by pulsing it, each tiny quartz crystal would produce electrical output. This e ffect is known in physics as the piezoelectric effect. 20 Any electrical stimulation within the Earth of piezoelectrical materials - such as quartz - would generate sound waves above the range of human hearing. Materials undergoing stress within the earth can emit bursts of ultrasonic radiation. Materials undergoing plastic deformation emit a signal of lower amplitude than when the deformation is such as to pr oduce cracks. Ball lightening has been speculated to be gas ionized by electricity from quartz-bearing rocks, such as granite, that is subject to stress. 21 Dunn produces the following diagram to accompany this comment. 19 Dunn, op. cit., pp. 127-129. 20 Piezo, meaning \"stone\". It is curious that the electrogravitics researcher and physicist Thomas Townsend Brown, whose othe r interests were known to have included UFOs, and who was alleged to have taken part in the design of the Philadelphia experiment, spent much of his last research investigating the electrical, magnetic, and acoustic properties of rocks. 21 Dunn, op. cit., p. 129 192"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" The Piezoelectric Effect So the choice of granite is now rath er obvious, for the weight of the Pyramid itself, pressing millions of tons of granite down through its stone courses, already places each tiny crystal under constant stress. Add to this the fact that the Pyramid's ball-and-socket construction allows it to move as a coupled harmonic oscillator means that a ll those quartz crystals are constantly being pulsed in resonance to the Schumann vibration of the earth itself. But note also, that this stress may also generate a cloud of ball lightening, an ionized plasma of gas that itself contains energy. When we question why there is a correlation between the earth's dimensions and the Great Pyramid, we come up with three logical alternatives. One is that the build ers wished to demonstrate their knowledge of the dimensions of the planet. They felt it necessary to encapsulate this knowledge in an indestructible structure so that future generations, thousands of years in the future, would know of their presence in the world and their knowledge of it. 22 The second possible answer could be that the Earth affected the function of the Great Pyramid. By incorporating the same basic measurements in the pyramid that were found on the planet, the efficiency of the pyramid was improved and, in effect, it could be a harmonic integer of the planet. A third alternative may involve both the first and second answers. The dimensions incorporated in the Great Pyramid may have been included to demonstrate the builders' knowledge or more importantly, 22 In other words, the \"time capsule\" hypothesis. 193 The Giza Death Sta r"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The Machine Hypothesis to symbolize the relationship between the Great Pyramid's true purpose and the Earth itself. 23 For reasons discussed in the next ch apter, I favor the second of these alternatives. 4. The Grand Gallery: An Acoustic Amplification Chamber and Helmholtz Resonators Dunn is at his most brilliant when he analyzes the Grand Gallery and what its missing components may once have been. Noting that the ceiling tiles in the gallery tilt at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, 24 he observes that the Gallery is so constructed to be a massive acoustic amplification chamber, designed to amplify and re flect acoustic waves up the Gallery toward the Antechamber. The mystery of the twenty-s even pairs of slots in the side ramps is logically explained if we theorize that each pair of slots contained a resonator assembly and the slots served to lock these assemblies into place. The original design of the resonators will always be open to question; however, if their function was to efficiently re spond (sic.) to the Earth's vibration, then we can surmise that they might be similar to a device we know of today that has a similar function - a Helmholtz resonator. 25 A classic Helmholtz resonator is a ho llow sphere, with an opening of 1/10 th to 175 th of the diameter of the sphere, us ually made from metal but possibly from other materials. 26 Its size determines the frequency at which it resonates. Dunn then builds his theory of wh at once existed inside the Grand Gallery. 23 Dunn, op. cit., p. 134. 24 Ibid., p. 164. 25 Ibid., p. 165. 26 Ibid. 194"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star To extrapolate further we could say th at each resonator assembly that was installed in the Grand Ga llery was equipped with several Helmholtz-type resonators that were tuned to different harmonic frequencies. In a series of harmonic steps, each resonator in the series responded at a higher frequency than the previous one....To increase the resonators' frequency, the ancient scientists would have made the dimensions smaller, and correspondingly reduced the distance be tween the two walls adjacent to each resonator. In fact, the wa lls of the Grand Gallery actually step inward seven times in their height and most probably the resonators' supports reached almost to the ceiling. At th eir base, the resonators we re anchored in the ramp slots. 27 He then produces the following diagrams of the resonator assemblies arrayed in the Grand Gallery. Let us pause at this juncture to obser ve some important points. First, note that Dunn has independently corroborated what Sitchin's texts indicate: that certain components, crucial to the f unctioning of the Pyramid, once existed inside the Grand Gallery itself. Ho wever, note also that there is a contradiction between what Sitchin's texts state and what Dunn hypothesizes once existed in the Grand Gallery. Sitchin's texts refer to the Gallery as having 27 Ibid., p. 166. 195"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The Machine Hypothesis been bathed in multi-colored light from several \"magic stones\" or crystals arrayed in the notches on the side ramps. Dunn, conversely, and on the basis of sound engineering principles, concl udes that the primary function of the Grand Gallery was as an acoustic harmonic amplification chamber. In the next chapter, we will present a speculative resolution of this contradiction. 5. The Antechamber: Sound Baffle With this very sound hypothesis in hand, Dunn next tackles the Antechamber. Drawing on Borchardt's hypothesis that the three slots did indeed once contain slabs that were lo wered like a portcullis, he presents a credible theory of why such a mach ine would have been necessary. His solution is elegant. Whatever was rais ed or lowered in the slots in the antechamber functioned to block out sound waves coming from the Grand Gallery harmonic amplification chambe r that were not of the desired frequency. By raising or lowering th ese objects, \"sound waves with an incorrect frequency have wavelengths th at do not coincide with the distance between the baffles and are filtered out.\" 28 Only the desired frequencies actually reach the King's Chamber. 6. The Air Shafts: Microwave Input and Output When turning to the King's Chamber, there are three features that are the central focus of Dunn's atte ntion. First, that the chamber itself resonates to the note f# on our own musical scale, a not e that is a harmonic overtone of the earth's own Schumann resonance. Second that the airshafts are not for the purpose of emitting air at all. And finally, the Coffer serves the purpose of coupling the input from the \"air sh afts\" with the acoustical harmonic amplification coming from the Grand Gallery.

Moreover, its presence there would explain the obvious melted look to the Coffer if at some point an accident or deliberate destruction occurred inside the chamber. As to how it all worked, Dunn puts it this way. Based on the previous evidence, sou nd must have been focused into the King's Chamber to force oscillations of the granite, creating in effect a vibrating mass of thousands of tons of granite. The freque ncies inside this chamber, then, would rise above the low frequency of the Earth -through a scale of harmonic steps - to a level mat would excite the hydrogen gas to higher energy levels. The King's Chamber is a technical wonder. It is where the Earth's mechanical energy was converted, or transduced, into usable power. It is a resonant cavity in which sound was focused. Sound roaring through the passageway at the resonant frequency of this chamber - or its harmonic - at sufficient amplitude would drive these granite beams to vibrate in resonance. Sound wave s not of the correct frequency would be filtered in the acoustic filte r, more commonly known as the Antechamber. 30 Thus the hydrogen gas would be both acousti cally and electrical ly stressed or pulsed. As the hydrogen atoms absorbed this energy, their electrons would be pumped to a higher state, and undergo qua ntum jumps until they fell back to their ground state.

The Coffer: The Optical Cavity of a Maser Dunn notes that one of the peculiar f eatures of the Coffer, itself an object with so many dimensional ra tios to the earth, the so lar system, and the galaxy, is also an optical cavity with concav e surfaces at each end. Since the electrons of the hydrogen atoms can be stimulated to fall back to their ground state by an input signal of the same frequenc y, one has here all the makings of a maser: signal input, an optical cavity to cohere the emission of photons as electrons jump out of and back to thei r ground state, and, in the southern \"air shaft\" leading from the King's Chamber back to the face of the Pyramid, a horn antenna used to collect microwav e beams. Thus the airshafts are not airshafts at all, but waveguides for microwave signal input and output. Dunn thus reasonably assumes, on sound scientific principles, that the Coffer was once correctly positioned exact ly between the two shafts. 31 \"The (originally smooth) surfaces on the outside of the Great Pyramid are 'dish-shaped' and may have been treated to serve as a co llector of radio waves in the microwave region that are constantly bombard ing the Earth from the universe.

Other chemical processes may have been used incorporating hydrogen sulfide, which would account for the odor. 34 9. Meltdown, or Deliberate Destruction? Having constructed this complex theo ry, Dunn then proceeds to account for the apparent violent disruption and dislocation evident in the King's Chamber: the slanted cracked walls, the melting of the Coffer, and the blackened limestone face on the surface of the interior of the Grand Gallery. These things he attributes to a \"mal function\" that led to the hydrogen, \"for some inexplicable reason,\" exploding in a ball of fire. 35 Having undergone this accident, he theorizes that the Pyramid's builders then tunneled up to the Grand Gallery in order to make repairs, the occasion of cutting the much- debated \"well shaft.\" Here again, however, Dunn's theory c ontradicts the paleographic evidence marshaled by Sitchin.

By applying Teste's technology in the Great Pyramid, using alternating timed pulses at the apex of the pyramid and in the Subterranean Chamber - a feature, by the way, that all the Egyptian pyramids have -we may be able to set into motion 5,273,834 tons of stone! If we have troubl e getting the Great Pyramid going, there are three small pyramids near by that we can start firs t to get things moving. 36 These pyramids, he hypothesizes, may ha ve been employed \"to assist the Great Pyramid in achieving resonance.\" 37 But these insights, made almost in passing, raise as many questions as they answer, and in doing so, point out the relatively few weaknesses in Dunn's brilliant analysis. Once having mentioned Tesla, Dunn does not really go into any significant detail about how Tesla's work may have been utilized in the Great Pyramid other than to set up vibrations. And if the other pyramidal structures at Giza were designed to help the Great Pyramid \"achieve resonance\", one must ask, res onance with what? It was, after all, already resonant to the earth.

By the beginning of the Christian era, mu ch of Plato's mathematics had become a riddle....

Why go to such lengths mere ly to encode \"equal tempering\" unless that system had something to do with something far more profound than merely a musical system? The last question suggests that something much more important, a tremendous secret of the ancient unified paleophysics, was at stake. In this section we shall summarize McClain's presentation in an attempt to uncover that secret. Briefly stated, that secret is: â€¢ That the \"equal tempering\" musical harmonic code encrypted in the Platonic mathematical allegories is only the first layer of a much more complex physics found encoded in Plat o. McClain has explored only that first layer; â€¢ That harmonic multiples of Planck's constant, the Planck length, and the Planck mass are expressed as acoustic information; â€¢ That this information occurs in some cases precisely at the tetrahedral hyperdimensional angles of ~ 19.5Â° Â±1Â°; and, â€¢ That these insights allow the broad outlines of a tetrahedral hyperdimensional physics model of system s kinetics to be reconstructed. Once these components of the ancient pa leophysics are recovered, one is then in a position to speculate on the engineering of the components of the Giza Death Star, including the missing com ponents and their possible functions. McClain observes that the Plat onic scholar Robert Brumbaugh Noted that the principled of 'aesth etic economy' in Pythagorean use of smallest integers - for examples of general relations in number theory -is itself a purely logical device in an age which (sic.) had not yet developed a general notation for al gebraic variables.

The gro up structure enters into the study by allowing the consideration of the tran slates of the obj ect under st udy, that is, by placing the object in a translation invariant space. The study consists of two steps. First: finding the 'elementary components' of the object, that is, objects of the same or similar class, which exhibit the simplest behavior under translation and which 'belong' to the object under study (harmonic or spectral analysis); and second, finding a way in which the object can be construed as a combination of its elementary components (harmonic or spectral synthesis). 4 One notes that the Platonic \"arithmetical analysis of harmonics\" is intended to be \"translation invariant\" because: â€¢ Plato claims for it that harmonics are the basis of planetary motions; â€¢ Because he uses it in connection with the much smaller motions of music; and, â€¢ Because these arithmetic laws al so embody motion and action at the quantum scale. The result of a careful analysis of th is \"arithmetized harm onics\" is a system that None of us could have anticipated: not only are all of Plato's mathematical allegories capable of a musical analysis - one which (sic.) makes sense out of every step in his arithmetic - but all of his allegories taken together prove to be a unified treatise on the musical scale so that each one throws light on the others. 5 3 Ibid., p. 2. 4 Yitzhak Katznelson, An Introduction to Harmonic Analysis (Dover, 1976), p. vii. 5 McClain, op. cit., p. 3. 204"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star That the ancient paleophys ics should have placed such emphasis on acoustic phenomena and harmonics is not surprisi ng, since they are the first physical laws besides astronomy to have been mathematically modeled. 6 As we shall discover in the next chapter, however, there is a more profound connection between acoustics and gravity. The problem of equal tempering is basic to this physics and to the engineering of it. Today we divide the musical octave into twelve equal parts with the value of This equal tempering gi ves the following scale: 7 Figure 1: The Equal Tempered Scal e However, musicians know that an octave of the ratio 1:2 is not di visible by ratios of pure rational numbers, because the powers of even numbers ( 2,4,8...etc) that define octaves are never coincident with powers of 3(9,27,81, etc.) that define intervals of fifths and fourths. Additionally, neither of these overtone series are coincident with the powers of 5 that define th e intervals of thirds.

It is to be noted that such unification is achieved by engineering, i.e., by the deliberate distortion and close approximation of the \"pure\" relationships of absolute mathematical and physical theory. Not to approximate th ese relationships would lead to the \"harmonic chaos\" of an infinite number of overtones to a fundamental. 8 And that in turn provides a clue as to how the paleoancient Very High Civilization may have achieved a unified physics. The basis of this encoded Platonic equal tempering is the harmonic ratio that Pythagoras allegedly brought to Greece from Babylon. The implications of this allegation should be obvious, for it tends to corroborate the supposition of a paleoancient Very High Civiliza tion of which Sumeria and Greece are the considerably declined legacies. The musical ratios that Pythagoras brought is the ratio 6:8::9:12.

Thus physics may be arithmetically and mathematically modeled, a model determined by arithmetic, harmonic, and geometric means.

This is the necessary mathematical constant upon which the development of quantum physics rests. The Pyramid's analogue approximations of PI are well known. In fact, most of the physical constants or geom etrical properties both of solar and of local terrestrial space find some expr ession in the Pyramid in terms of redundant approximations. It stands to reason that one may expect similar approximations of this crucial physical constant if in fact the Pyramid was engineered on the basis of a sophisticat ed unified physics.

And this indicates the \"adumbration\" may be something more. 10h would equal 662600, and subtracting the distance measure of the Great Step to the Antechamber of 616266 gives 46334, which is approximately the value of 7h (46383). Why is this significant? Firs t, because it gives another redundancy. And second, because the measures are al l approximations of the neutral point between the moon's and the earth's grav ity. But one can only have this mean point if the gravitational attraction of the moon is significantly larger than the 176 th gravitational attraction usually as cribed to the moon. A discrepancy exists between published figures for th e moon's gravity and the mean point between the earth and the m oon's gravitational fields. 21 Based on calculations for the mean point based on Newtonian mechanics and the idea of the moon having 176 th the gravity of the 1 Cf.

This error may have led to early disasters in sending probes into lunar orbit, since miscalculation of this mean point meant th at orbital insertions occurred at the wrong point and velocities. A higher gr avitational acceleration on the moon's surface would therefore also imply that far more rocket fuel would have been needed on the LEM when blasting off fr om the moon than it actually carried. Some other additional means of propulsion must therefore have been required to return the LEM from the moon's surface to the orbiting Command Module. And all of this means two things. First, that there are discrepancies in the moon landing and published facts that suggest a cover-up is taking place. 22 Second, and more importantly, the Pyra mid's builders not only knew a great deal about the local gravity of the l una-terra planetary system but were expressing it in terms of two different ha rmonics of Planck's constant, set to a theoretical value of 6626. In short, they were expre ssing a planetary system configuration as a harmonic of a quantum state. An even more interesting embedding of Planck's constant of action is discovered in the measure mentioned by \"prophecy-in-stone\" exponent Adam Rutherford, who noted that the \"Royal C ubit\" unit of measure was equivalent to 4y/10 3 âˆš PI sacred cubits, or 0.8242637 Sacred cubits.

Unexpected Redundant Approximations and Harmonics of Planck's Constant In Significant Functional St ructures of the Great Pyramid. In the next chapter I hypothesize that the basic unified physics that was weaponized in the Great Pyramid utilized some engineered version of Bohm's \"pilot wave\" 23 acting as a carrier wave for harmonically coupled and cohered acoustic and electromagnetic energy. Ca rried by such a superluminal pilot wave, energy travels in non-linear, time-reversed fashion di rectly into the nuclei of targets, pulsing energy past the threshold of stability and initiating nuclear reactions. Direction of such pulsed \"pilot waves\" would seem to occur by dint of some form of harmoni c interferometry, which, I suggest in the next chapter, was the possible function of some of the other structures at Giza. Given this basic hypothesis, and relia nt upon the careful analysis of Dunn and Sitchin, the four principle internal chambers within the Great Pyramid - the Queen's Chamber, the Grand Galle ry, the Antechamber, and the King's Chamber - and their missing components should exhibit re dundant harmonic approximations or multiples of these Planck units. A word is necessary as to why this is so. The Great Pyramid itself is not only a harmonic oscillator (Dunn's hypothesis), and 23 One may, perhaps, speculate that this notion to maintain that Bohm's \"pilot wave,\" Tesla's \"standing wave\" and Bearde n's \"scalar waves,\" the probability wave in the phase space of quantum mechanics bel ong to the same family of wave forms. 221"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The Paleography of Paleophysics, Part Two: Pythagoras, Plato, Planck, and the Pyramid not only a radiation collector and reflector (its parabolic polished faces), but a huge crystal. Careful study of the dimens ions of its internal chambers reveals that it is also a harmonic oscillat or composed of several other harmonic oscillators, each focusing and amplif ying their energies into the King's Chamber. In short, the Pyramid is constr ucted as a series of nested feedback loops. The functions of these four chambers that then suggest themselves - and anticipating somewhat the results of the next chapter are these: (1) The Queen's Chamber was understood to have housed some mechanism for the induction of chem ical reactions to create hydrogen gas, and possibly to initiate some e ndothermic plasma state in that gas pace Dunn. (2) The Grand Gallery is a gravito-acoustic amplification chamber, filled (perhaps) with artificial (possi bly liquid) crystals resonant acoustically and gravitationally with the earth and other celestial systems in a manner similar to Dunn' s Helmholtz resonator arrays. On this analysis, we accept Dunn's conclusion that the chamber was filled with hydrogen, and in our view, with an endothermic hydrogen plasma that provided most of th e nuclear and electromagnetic energy being coupled and amplified in the chamber. (3) The Antechamber - again following Dunn - is understood to be a baffle chamber filtering non-resonant wavelengths, i.e., wavelengths not resonant with the target, from entering the King's Chamber. (4) The King's Chamber is understood to be a complicated phase conjugate mirror and howitzer, rely ing upon the principle of harmonic coupling of all known forms of en ergy and cohering that coupled energy to the superluminal pilot wave.

Approximations Necessary to En gineer and Weaponize the Physics Why only approximations, howeve r? If the paleophysics was sophisticated enough to be genuinely unified and engin eerable then one answer - albeit a highly speculative one - suggests itself. The approximations, expressed in terms of the units of m easure unique to the Pyramid itself i.e., the \"Pyramid inch\" and so on, may have been necessary to achieve an engineerable unification of physics utiliz ing standard dimensional analysis. If the Observer - in this case the Pyrami d itself - imposed upon the systems it is observing or \"harmonically entangling\" un its of measure arbitrarily selected with no relationship to those systems, th en it would not have been possible to \"observe,\" that is, to couple them ha rmonically.

Time Differentials In Chapter Three The Paleography of Paleophysics I stated that time was the primary differential of the ancien t paleophysics, given its preoccupation with harmonics at all scales of size, from the motions of planets to sub- atomic particles. Because of this, I posited a \"systems\" approach to the Pyramid, since three different systems were coupled and oscillated in it. I call these systems the Base Planetary, Base St ellar or Solar, and Base Celestial or Galactic Systems, designating the eart h, the solar system, and the Milky Way galaxy respectively. The motions of these systems, and of the gravitational, electromagnetic, and acoustic forces of planetary and atom ic sized bodies may be expressed as \"time differentials \" in the relative rates of change between each of these systems, since the only way of measuring time is precisely by the relative motions of bodies, whether planetary or atomic. This leads to a conclusion about one putative principle of paleophysics: the forces and energies of physics may be modeled or expressed by equations where time is the primary differential, and this in turn may lead to the formulation of a rigorously unified field theory on that basis.

This view corroborates the Sanskrit vimana text s as well as the unified field view evident in the physics behind the Pyramid. (8) Missing Components Sitchin and Dunn, on the basis of entirely different t ypes of evidence, each conclude - apparently independently - that the Great Pyramid is missing its most vital components. â€¢ For Dunn, these missing components consist of banks of Helmholtz resonators, resonant to th e various harmonics of the 238"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star earth, arrayed inside the acoustic amplification chamber, the Grand Gallery. â€¢ Dunn also indicates that some sort of machine to establish vibrations to \"prime\" the Pyramid might once have existed in the subterranean chamber, and possibly in the underground chambers of the other Pyramids of Giza as well. â€¢ For Sitchin, however, the missing components consist of \"ray-emitting crystals\" inside the Grand Gallery, giving off a multicolored rainbow of dazzling light in the chamber. Othe r \"magic stones\" determined the \"destiny\" and \"guidance\" of the weapon. B. How it All Worked: The Background Physics, Part One: Since this unified physics and co rrespondingly unified technology made use of the above principles, it is no acci dent that the Pyramid made use of celestial and terrestrial relationships and that th ese relationships have been misinterpreted by the \"time capsule\" a nd \"observatory\" hypotheses and totally overlooked by the \"machine\" hypothe sis of Dunn. All other hypotheses overlook the only paleographic evidence th at clearly specifies a function for the Pyramid, namely, that it was a weapon utilizing these principles. However, it should be noted that the \" time capsule\" and \"observatory\" aspects of the Pyramid are essential to its function as a weapon. The weapon hypothesis must therefore explain the basic functions of purposes of: (1) the celestial relationships embedded within the structure; (2) the same mathematical relationships found in discrete or separated parts of the Pyramid and how the possible internal relationships between them contributed to its function. As Dunn repeatedly notes, the terrestrial geometries are found in the Pyramid to \"increase its efficiency\" as a machine. By th e same token then, the solar and galactic geometries present in it must be for a similar purpose. 239"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"The Weapon Hypothesis (3) The functions of the inner ch ambers of the Great Pyramid (4) The possible functions of the other structures at Giza. Let us now recall the implications of th e texts examined in chapter two, and particularly the texts examined by Zechar iah Sitchin, in a series of postulates: These considerations rise to a peculi ar answer to the question raised by the \"time capsule\" hypothesis. Briefly, this hypothesis maintains that the Pyramid was built as a monument to \"preserve the knowledge\" that the paleoancient Very High Civilization had acquired for posterity. In some versions this hypothesis is maintained because that civilization presumably faced some great cataclysm. In other versions it assumes the form of the \"prophecy-in-stone\" hypothesis, that its builders po ssessed some divinely inspired prophetic knowledge of future ev ents that they then encoded in the mathematical dimensions of the structure. However, since the Pyramid could very easily have been destroyed by any civilization that purported ly possessed nuclear weapons, then question then becomes one of why it was left standi ng after its internal components were removed upon the order to destroy the w eapon, especially since that weapon was so greatly feared. Clear ly then, the internal components were crucial to its functioning as a weapon since thei r removal rendered it non-operational. Presumably such components could, however, have been rebuilt and the weapon again made operational. So why wa s the structure left standing? This is an important clue. Apparently there was no fear that such components could be easily reconstructed. Two basi c explanations present themselves as to why this is so: â€¢ They were too expensive to produce in the aftermath of a major war. But this alternative should be disc ounted, for the mere potential of their reproduction would seem to be unacceptable to the victors of Sitchin's \"Second Pyramid War,\" si nce it had been fought for the purpose of destroying the weapon. 240"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star â€¢ The society that built th e Pyramid was considerably more advanced that those of the victors in that war, and its technological infrastructure was decimated to th e point that the knowledge and/or infrastructure know longer existed to produce its missing components. In short, the Very High Civilizati on had begun its long decline to the levels of \"civilization\" of the anci ent worlds of Egypt, Sumer, and the Indus Valley. This would appear to be the more likely explanation. It is therefore reasonable to assume that it was left standing as a memorial or monument of that war and as a warning against the misuses of the technology that enabled its design and constructi on, much like the Nazi death camps are left as memorials, not only tocommemora te the victory over an evil regime, but also to commemorate its victims a nd the evil uses to which technology was put. On this basis the Pyramid is indeed a \"time capsule\" containing a message and \"lost knowledge \" (literally in the form of its missing internal components). However, the message and knowledge that time capsule were meant to preserve have been grossly misinterpreted by current advocates of the \"time caps ule\" hypothesis. The message it was intended to convey after its destruction was a moral one, no t a scientific or prophetic one. Sitchin's texts attribute to this weapon, and particularly to its missing components, the necessary parts of a sophisticated weapons system: a tracking and targeting system, and a \"pul sed\" beam. Thus if the Pyramid was a weapon, then one should expect a \"military\" look not only to its but the surrounding architecture.

We are now in a position to extrapolate the principles of this weaponized paleophysics upon the following foundations: â€¢ a comparison of the Pyramid's known mathematical and physical properties; â€¢ the relevant ancient texts, â€¢ anomalous phenomena within modern physical science; â€¢ current theory within modern physics; â€¢ an extrapolation of theoretical pr inciples from the Pyramid itself. 6 Given the implications of this physics for limitless energy as well as its potential for military uses, however, one must also acknowledge the strong possibility that such research ma y already have been undertaken by institutions or parties interested in 5 Some of the so-called \"temples\" at Giza display remarkably similar and precise engineering and are of similar antiquity. Could these \"temples\" at one time been used for such purposes? 6 This is the most problematical, though nonetheless necessary, component of the methodology. Problematical, in that rather than explaining the Pyramid by the known principles of physics, it departs from a strictly scientific method at this precise juncture. Necessary, however, in that all known and accep ted principles of contemporary standard theoretical physics can take one only so far but no farther. To a great extent, the paleographical evidence demands such speculation. Since ther e is abundant evidence that the physics and engineering involved in the Pyrami d was at least as advanced as our own, we are justified in using the Pyramid itself as a basis from which to extrapolate the principles of a new theoretical construction. 243"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"The Weapon Hypothesis monopolizing and deploying such tec hnology to secure their own power. 7 The basic principle of the paleophysic s of the \"Giza Death Star\" may now be clearly stated: Any technological utilization of a theoretically unified physics for weaponized purposes must employ an e ngineered systems state harmonically coupled to all the systems to be oscillated in such a way as to amplify all of them, i.e., it must couple to the \"base\" or \"fundament al\" terrestrial system, as well as to the base solar and celestial sy stems to be oscillat ed and amplified. This obviously implies that there is a physical and theoretical basis to the astrological doctrine that \"destiny\" is an effect of the geometric configuration of the heavens (the base solar and celestial systems) in relation to the earth (the base terrestrial system). These considerations suggest the following physical a nd terminological model lies behind the Giza Death Star: (1) The harmonic fundamentals and re sonances, that is to say, the cyclotronic and Schumann resonances, of the base and target systems must be reproduced in the coupled oscillator (the weapon itself), where \"base system\" or \"base terrestrial system\" or \"base planetary system\" are synonymous, and define d as the inertial frame of reference for a planetary observer - i.e., the weapon itself - in that system; (2) The coupling of the oscillator to the base or fundamental planetary system may or may not have to occur by actual physical contact with the base system, though this is the case with the Pyramid itself. 8 This suggests that the key to such technology lies not along di gital, but along analog, 7 It is reported that the Schorr expediti on's results have been sealed by the Egyptian government, which may or may not have been acting on its own, or which may or may not have been the ultimate source of the sealing order. 8 That is to say, at the current stage of research, one cannot say with certainty what the principle of the paleophysics was, i.e., whether or not it required such local physical contact with the base planetary system. My intuition, however, tells me that it did. 244"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star harmonic coupling. Any digital elem ent would have been primarily utilized in the design, information transcription, and \"tuning\" (targeting) of the weapon. Since the Pyramid and the Giza complex as a whole are also analogically coupled to the base solar and celestial systems, this suggests that non-local systems may be harmonically coupled by analogs of those systems. This in turn implies that the basis of such coupling is on some practical application of Bell' s non-locality theorem in order to transfer the energies of thos e systems at any given moment; (3) The coupled oscillator-amplifier (the Pyramid itself) must employ several \"nested\" layers of these harmonic re lationships to amplify the harmonics of the geometry of the total acoustic, inertial, and electromagnetic energy of the base planetary, solar, and cele stial systems. Moreover, the careful placement of those dimensions within the structure will direct the various forms of energy to the proper place for coupling to each other. This would have required computer-aided designing; (4) The primary acoustic energy input of the coupled oscillator-amplifier derives from the base terrestrial system; (5) The coupled oscillator-amp lifier must have an ac oustically and optically resonant amplification chamber resona nt to the base planetary system's Schumann resonance (Grand Gallery); (6) It must likewise be resonant to the thermal and mass gradients of the base terrestrial system; (7) The tracking and targeting of the wea pon occurs as a result of a harmonic interferometry, which indicates one possible function of the other Giza structures as well as the possible function of some of the Pyramid's missing components; (8) Thus, the Great Pyramid, and the Gi za complex as a whole, gives a comprehensive - though due to the absence of some internal components, not a complete - list of the required mathematical and physical properties of such a weapon. 245"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"The Weapon Hypothesis The use of such a weapon, while fa r more horrific than the use of thermonuclear weapons in the targeted area, would not necessarily involve collateral damage to the society po ssessing and deploy ing it. However, theoretically, such a wea pon would be capable of a \"one shot planetary destruction.\" Some means of calibrati ng and damping the energy output of the weapon would therefore also have to be incorporated in the original design. (1) Definitions: These principles require some definition of the types of systems utilized in drawing and directing the energy of the weapon. (a) of Systems: Base Planetary System, Fundamental Sy stem, and Base Terrestrial System: These terms are synonymous and define the planetary system to be harmonically oscillated and amplified, in this case, the earth. It is the inertial frame of reference of the os cillator - weapon, wh ich is in turn defined as the observer. Base Solar, or Base Stellar, System: These terms are synonymous and define the solar system, including the stellar center of that system, in which the base planetary system exists. It is in clusive of the stellar mass, the total planetary mass, and any and all possibl e geometric configurations of the elements of that system, including any significant planetary bodies possessing angular momentum relative to its stellar center. Base Celestial, or Base Galactic, System: These phrases are synonymous and indicates the galactic system in which the base planetary and solar systems exist and possess angular mome ntum relative to the galactic center of mass. It is evident from these considerations that the primary form of energy being accessed by the Great Pyramid is inertial, i.e., the very energy that results from a particular configuration of space. 246"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star Accordingly, its builders also had to presuppose that the energy of a non-local system, for example, the galactic center, was transmitted via the superluminal transcription of information in the aether hyperspace. They are relying, in other words, on some paleophysical ve rsion of Bohm's notion of a \"pilot wave\" and Bell's non-locality theorem to draw energy from these distant sources. From these considerations it is further evident that any fundamental planetary system to be oscillated and amplified must be harmonically coupled to certain fundamental physical geometries: (1) the precession of the base pl anetary system's equinoxes; (2) the precession of the base ste llar system's equinoxes; and to (3) the base celestial system's equator. In other words, the paleoancient Very High Civilization that built the Great Pyramid was at the minimum a Type II civilization. The purpose of the analogical or harm onic coupling to thes e geometries is clear, and has nothing whatsoever to do with any metaphysical or religious explanations subsequently fasten ed by Egyptian society upon them. The coupling was solely to access the enorm ous energy latent in these physical configurations via Bell's principle of non-locality. The energy potential of the total system is thus dependent upon the info rmation in the field, that is to say, the geometric configuration of these interlocked systems at any given moment. And thus one may draw a final corollary by means of the verification of the theoretical construc t: the energy yield of any nuclear or thermonuclear device is dependent upon th e geometry, that is, the harmonics, of any given time and place that it is utilized. 10 The geometric configuration of systems is thus the 9 Cf.

(b) Of Base Time, or the Primary Differential The Base Time of the Total System: If the \"total system\" is defined as the base planetary, solar, a nd celestial systems, as well as the coupled harmonic oscillator and amplifier itself locally grounded to the base planetary system (i.e., the Pyramid itself ), then the \"base time\" of the total system denotes the geometric configur ation of the base planetary, solar, and celestial systems at the moment the coupled oscillator and amplifier becomes fully operational. It is to be noted that this putative pr inciple of the paleophys ics of the Pyramid also requires careful design modeling of the weapon before the construction was actually begun, so that the oscillator would begin to function fully at the precise moment when the chosen geomet ric configurations of those systems aligned with the oscillator and allowed it to be primed to peak efficiency. Thus not only did the structure have to be computer-designed, so did the timing and process of construction, since the purpose of the device itself is precisely to engineer local spac e-time for destructive purposes. Artificial Harmonic Entanglement: Once the locally grounded oscillator and amplifier is so coupled to the three systems and fully functional, the systems are said to be artificially harmonically entangled and will continue to be entangle d so long as the geometri c analogy of the oscillator- interferometer is not significantly alte red. As long as it is an analog of those systems, the systems remain entangled in and by the oscillator.

This may explain why attempts to repeat experi ments in endothermic fusion or zero- point energy powerplants sometimes fail. T.E. Bearden comments as follows: For example, Frank Gordon once developed an electric motor which (Sic.) after several years produced an output power which was 1.67 times greater the input power. What we did not know was that his years of operation and struggle with the moto r and its structure had gradually deterministically charged-up (activated) the local atomic nuclei and activated the local vacuum potential. Thus the motor gradually \"grew\" its increase in power, seemingly violating the conservation of energy if one tried to regard the moto r as a closed system.

In other words, Frank had formed a stru ctured quatum potential in the local area, coupled to the machine.) 11 These are the exact principles in opera tion at Giza, since the mathematical relationships of the Giza complex and its entangled systems also structure the local base planetary potential of the vacuum by drawing on the already structured potential of all three systems.

(3) Base Planetary System Geographic A lignment: The harmonic oscillator and amplifier should be al igned to the true north- south axis of the base planetary system. 13 Its faces should be parabolic, aligned to the four cardinal compass points of the base planetary system.

Again, these are but the extrapolations of the principles of physics and technology that the Pyramid itself suggests. Now we must pause a moment to sa y a few more words about Christopher Dunn's ingenious power plant hypothe sis once again. Suppose that the paleoancient Very high Civ ilization really did build th e Pyramid as some sort of power plant to provide wireless elec trical power, along similar lines that Nichola Tesla once indicated that he c ould provide wireless electrical power all over the face of the eart h with a very few \"transmitters.\" Indeed, Tesla also indicated that the same t echnology could deliver a \"d eath ray\" of enormous destructive power to a target. To do so would require but a simple \"retuning\" - to use Tesla's word - of the power pl ant to focus its el ectrical transmission, from a diffuse earth-enshrouding field to a concentrated bolt pinpointed on a target. In other words, the unified physics being postulated for the paleoancient Very High Civilization allows the same device to function in both roles by simple reconfiguration of the system. However, certain aspects of the power plant version of the machine hypothesis now fail, and fail in the light of Mr. Dunn's own analysis. For example: (1) He assumes the existence of \"extra-terrestrials\" that would require a microwave signal output. In other wo rds, the microwaves are cohered and enormous power output is required for interstellar communication. The problem is that the suggested physics embodied in the Pyramid exceeds our contemporary principles of physics, and this would in turn seem to make such slow methods of 17 Cf. the discussion of the use of hydrogen in the previous chapter. 253"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"The Weapon Hypothesis communication between star system s rather inefficient. So the purpose of the microwave output of the Pyramid does not appear to be for the purposes of communication primarily. Why put such extraordinary effort and expense into an interstellar long distance phone call, since the whole princi ple of non-locality would have made microwave communications as e fficient to that society as the Pony Express is to our own? (2) Dunn also emphasizes the piezo-electric effect is being utilized for electrical output. But again, the prin ciples of physic s embodied in the Great Pyramid suggest a physics beyond our own. If Tesla could claim to transmit wireless power wit hout millions of tons of granite, then the granite that constitu tes the overwhelming bulk of the Pyramid's must have served some ot her function that required such an enormous mass. 18 In other words, if one accepts, as both Dunn and this author do, the hypothesis of a technologically sophisticated very ancient culture, then the biggest anomaly of all still remains. Why build such an expensive and enormous pile of rocks just to have a maser and electricity, or just to \"talk to the stars\" in some paleoancient SETI project? The anomaly of the size, purpose, and expense still remains. Military projects, however, are well-known for both size and expense, and human na ture being what it is, I see no reason why the same should not ha ve been true in ancient times. (3) Finally, there is the question of the Grand Gallery -Dunn's resonance chamber - itself. What power plant employs banks of Helmholtz resonators in an amplification 18 Another point must be stressed here, and that is the expense of building such a structure. Presumably a paleoancient Very high Civilization would have had the technology to build power plants without the expense of quarrying and moving tons of granite, so some functional purpose is left unexplained, a purpose justifying the enormous outlay of financial resources to c onstruct such a labor-intensive structure. The only analog to such expenses in our own culture is sophisticated military systems. 254"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star chamber?

Why build an e normous pile of precisely tooled granite, weighing millions of t ons, align it precisely to every conceivable principle of celestial and terrestrial mechanics, and fill it with Helmholtz resonators, just to \"phone home?\" Clearly something more than just \"power output\" or communications would seem to be implied, given the enormous energies that are being coupled. In short, Dunn's bold and ingenious explan ation is indeed bri lliant, but raises as many questions as it answers since he limits himself to e xplanations guided by current paradigms of orthodox scien ce and technology. In fairness to him, it should be noted that one senses much perplexity on his part in the final pages of his book as he wrestles precis ely with these types of questions. Of course, use of the putative princi ples of paleophysics to build power plants is possible, but in that case, one would expect several much smaller, less expensive installations, perhaps one in each paleoancient household, drawing energy from the heavens. The e normity of the Giza Death Star, and the principles it embodies, were, as Sitchin's texts indicate, for but one purpose. C. How it all Worked: The Background Physics, Part Two: Tesla 's High Frequency Direct Current \"Impulse \" Technology The vast influence of the electrical work of Nichola Tesla is known to most informed people. Less well-known are the directions that Tesla's experimental research took from the close of the 19 th century to the end of his life.

Whether those stories are true - and I am inclined to believe that they are - the work of the last period of his life, incorporating some of Tesla's most brilliant experimental insights, affords a crucial look into the nature of physical reality as well as an understanding of the conflict between physics as an experimental science and as a theo retical and mathematical discipline. Moreover, Tesla's late work, and its s ubsequent profound misi nterpretation by theoretical physics' orthodoxy, demonstrat e the degree to which the received theories and paradigms of \"normal scienc e\" can inhibit scientific insight, and be manipulated by vested power elit es to close down lines of inquiry threatening to their own basis of power. The author and science researcher Ge rry Vassilatos has long investigated the \"forgotten\" highways of the physical sciences, and of th e peculiarities of Tesla's last lines of research and his ow n extraordinary claims with regard to its positive and negative potentialities. Vassilatos' work, Secrets of Cole War Technology: Project HAARP and Beyond, c ontains the clearest account in public literature of the \"electrical impul se\" investigations that so consumed Tesla in his later life. In this sect ion we rely upon Vassi latos' account to summarize the experiment that led Tesla to investigate a whole new electromagnetic phenomenon, as well as the subsequent experiments he devised to confirm and expand his knowle dge of it. These were precisely the experiments upon which Tesla based so many of his extravagant claims for a new source of limitless energy, as well as his seemingly fantastic claims for a weapon of mass destruction of planetary-busting power. Vassilatos begins his account as follows: But while endeavoring toward his own means for identifying electrical waves, Tesla was blesse d with an accidental observation which forever changed the course of his experimental investigations.... Part of this apparatus (was) ... a very powerful capacitor bank. This capacitor \"battery\" was charged to very high voltages, and subsequently discharged through short copper bus-bars. The explosive bursts thus obtained pr oduced several co incident phenomena which (sic, et 256"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star passim) deeply impressed Tesla, far exceeding the power of any electrical display he had ever seen. These proved to hold an essential secret which he was determined to uncover. The abrupt sparks, which he termed 'disruptive discharg es', were found capable of exploding wires into vapo r. They propelled the very sharp Shockwaves which struck him with great force across the whole front of his body. Of this surprising physic al effect, Tesla was exceedingly intrigued. Rather like gunshots of extraordinary power than electrical sparks, Tesla was completely absorbed in this new study. Electrical impulses produced effects commonly associated only with lightening. The explosive effects reminded him of similar occurrences observed with high voltage DC generators. A familiar experience among workers and engineers, the simple closing of a switch on a high voltage dynamo often brought a stinging shock, the assumed result of residual static charging. 19 This phenomenon led both power compa ny engineers and Tesla to speculate on the reasons for this strange discharg e. It should also be noted that the effect Tesla was obtaining bears some resemblance to the \"electro-hydro- dynamic\" phenomena being observed by Hannes Alfven mentioned in chapter three. The theoretical and metaphorical framework in which Tesla framed his explanatory hypothesis for his next series of experiments points to a profound and persistent problem in theoretical physics, from relativity to quantum mechanics. At this juncture, it is impor tant to recall that Tesla formulated his explanation before either of these theoretical bulwarks of modern physics were formulated. Tesla knew that the strange supercharg ing effect was only observed at the very instant in which dynamos were a pplied to wire lines, just as in his explosive capacitor discharges. Though the two instances were completely different, they both produced the very same effects. The instantaneous surge supplied by dynamos briefly appeared superconcentrated in l ong (power) lines.

So also it was with the electrical force, charges meeting up against a seemingly solid wa ll. But the effect lasted only as long as the impact. Until current carriers had actually 'caught up' with the applied electrical field, the charges sprang from the line in all directions.... (Tesla) began wondering why it was possible for electrostatic fields to move more quickly than the actual charges themselves, a perplexing mystery. 21 That is, Tesla knew that the electrical current moved at approximately the speed of light. But this in turn meant that the electrostatic field itself was moving at a superluminal velocity. The careful reader will now recall that this is almost exactly the same position as quantum physicist David Bohm's supposition of a superluminal \"pilot wave\" guiding the slower luminal velocity electrons along their paths. 22 As Tesla saw it, the problem was that the brief, almost instantaneous application or \"impulse\" of electrical power impacti ng against the resistance barrier brought on an abnormally \"electro-densified condition.\" 23 Through experimentation, Tesla determined \"that he could literally shape the resultant discharge, by modifying circuit paramete rs. Time, force, and resistance were (the) variables necessary to producing (sic.) the phenomenon.\" 24 At this juncture, recall that Alfven likewise maintains more or less the same thing, time, force, and resistance were variables that appeared to follow laws that were scale invariant from la boratory sized experi ments to galactic superclusters.

Finally, an analogy may be helpful to explain the phenomenon. Tesla's reasoning behind the discharge was essen tially this. At the very moment that the electrons of the current spark struck the wire or bus-bar, the geometry and density of the atoms in the bar effectivel y raised the resistance of the wire to infinity. No matter how high the current of the spark, the discharge still occurred. Electrons hit the resistance ba rrier, and splattered out from the surface of the bar in all directions perpendicularly. We're all familiar with another form of this phenomenon. We've all climbed a diving board and jumped into a swimming pool, only to \"belly-flop\" and smack against the resistance of the surface of the water. At that very instant, no matter how fast we jump or how much we weigh, we hit up against that momentarily \"infinite\" resistance of the water's surf ace, and send water splashing out in all directions around us. What Tesla did was to break the current at the very moment the electrons hit the surface of the wire, much like if we could, at the very instant we hit the water, \"run the film backwards\" and do it over and over again in quick succession. With th is simple analogy in mind, let us continue with Tesla. In order to test the phenomenon furt her, Tesla resolved to repeat the experiments with direct current to e liminate the \"backrush\" to the dynamo caused by alternating current. The result this time was even more astonishing: The sudden quick closure of the switch now brought a penetrating shock wave throughout the laboratory, one which could be felt both as a sharp pressure and a penetrating electrical irri tation. A 'sting'. Face and hands were especially sensitive to the explosive Shockwaves, which also produced a curious 'stinging' effect at close range. Tesla believed that material particles approaching the vapor state were literally thrust out of the wires in all directions. 25 In order to better study (sic.) these effects, he poi sed himself behind a glass shield and 25 What Tesla meant by \"the vapor state\" would be approximately what a quantum physicist would mean by quantum or sub-quantum particles, what we have called alternatively \"quantumstuff\" or aether. 259"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"The Weapon Hypothesis resumed the study. Despite the shield, bo th Shockwaves and stinging effects were felt by the now mystified Tesla. This anomaly provoked a curiosity of the very deepest kind, for such a thing was never before observed. More powerful and penetrating than the mere electrostatic charging of metals, this phenomenon literally propelled high voltage out into the surrounding space where it was felt as a stinging sensation. 26 Throughout these experiments, in othe r words, Tesla was not only observing over-unity energy output - getting more energy out than he was putting in - but feeling Shockwaves apparently obliv ious to the normal shielding effects of matter. He was getting more energy out of the system than he was putting into it, and feeling waves that travel ed clean through solid objects like they were so much air. No wonder he was my stified! But he made the appropriate conclusion; his system was not a closed system, but an open system, and he was somehow accessing a source of energy outside the system by dint of some inherent properties of the configuration of the system itself. In 1892, Tesla published a lecture in whic h he detailed these experiments. Titled \"The Dissipation of Electricity,\" th is lecture marks the point in Tesla's career where he abandoned research in to high frequency alternating current for good in order to conduct a new line of experiments to describe the phenomenon of high energy direct current impulses and the resulting \"shockwaves.\" 27 He now prepared an extensive series of tests in order to determine the true cause and nature of these shocki ng air pulses. In his article, Tesla describes the shield-permeating shocks as 'soundwaves (sic.) of electrified air.' Nevertheless, he makes a remarkable statement concerning the sound, heat, light, pressure, and shock which he sensed passing directly through copper plates. Collectively, they 'imply the presence of a medium of gaseous structure, that is, one c onsisting of independe nt carriers capable of free motion.' Since air was obviously not mis 'medium', to what then was he referring? Further in the article he clearly states that 'besides the air, another medium is present.' 26 Ibid., p. 29. 27 Vassilatos, op. cit., p. 31. 260"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star Through successive experimental arrangements, Tesla discovered several facts concerning the production of this effect. First, the cause was undoubtedly found in the abruptness of the charging. It was in the switch closure, the very instant of 'closure and break,' which thrust the effect out into space. The effect was definitely related to time, impulse time. Second, Tesla found that it was imperative that the charging process occurred in a single impulse. No reversal of curren t was permissible, else the effect would not manifest. In this, Tesla made succinct remarks describing the role of capacity in the spark-radiative circuit. He found that the effect was powerfully strengthened by placing a capacity between the disruptor and the dynamo. While providing a tremendous power to the effect, the dielectric of the capacitor also served to prot ect the dynamo windin gs.... The effect could also be greatly in tensified to new and more powerful levels by raising the voltage, quickening the switch 'make-break' rate, and shortening the actual time of switch closure. 28 It is now to be noted that the gran ite core of the Great Pyramid would function like a giant capacitor in Tesla' s experiment, since its piezo-electric properties, under constant stress both from the mass of the structure as well as its resonance to the Schumann resona nce would so stress the core as to build up a phenomenal charge. In othe r words, the Pyramid utilized some form of the same impulse energy discovered by Tesla. Tesla's experiments also reveal more properties relevant to the Pyramid's function as a weapon. He discovered that it was possible to amplify the Shockwave effect of the impulse by an asymmetrical geometric arrangement of the system's components. 29 \"By placing the magnetic discharger closer to one or the other side of the discharg ing dynamo, either force positive or force negative vectors could be selected and projected.\" 30 That is, the power output of the system varied as a function of the geometrical configuration of its components, exactly what our model of the hyperdimensional physics predicts.

More importantly, \"Tesla found it im possible to measure a diminution in radiant force at several hundred yards. In comparison, he recalled that Hertz found it relatively easy to measure notable inverse square diminutions.... Tesla suspected that these effects were coherent, not subject to inverse laws other than those due to ray divergence.\" 31 We have already discovered that Dunn convincingly argues that a cohe red microwave output was involved in the Great Pyramid. But Tesla's discovery interests us for an other reason, and that is the reliance of his open system upon geometric configuration to tap some unknown source of energy not subject to normal inverse square relations. And that energy was some sort of electro-acoustic cohered longitudinal wave. It remains to be shown how cohered microwaves and electrical impulses might be connected and might have been weaponized in the Great Pyramid. But Tesla's most astonishing hypothetic al model concerns the actual over- unity energies he claimed to observe in his experiments. Actual calculation of these disc harge ratios proved impossible. Implementing the standard magneto-inductive transformer rule, Tesla was unable to account for the enormous voltage multiplication effect. Conventional relationships failing, Tesla hypothesized that the effect was due entirely to radiant transformation rules, obviously requiring empirical demonstration. Subsequent measurements of discharge lengths and helix attributes provided the necessary new mathematical relationship. He had discovered a new induction law, one whose radiant Shockwaves actually auto-intensified when encountering segmented objects. The segmentation was the key to intensifying the action Radiant Shockwaves encountered an helix (sic.) and 'flashed over' the outer skin, from end to end. This Shockwave did not pass through the windings of the coil at all, treating the coil su rface as an aerodynamic plane.

Let us see how they closely correlate to what is found in the Great Pyramid. Viewed in one sense, the granite co re of the Pyramid, its vast stone courses and the geometric shape of the Pyramid itself as a \"squared circle\" would function as a capacito r reliant upon the piezo-electric properties of the granite itself. However, viewed in yet another sense, The Pyramid, precisely as a squared circle, is an electrical coil that is segmented - exactly in accordance with the principles discovered by Tesla - not only into separate \"windings \" in the stone courses, but each of these \"windings\" in turn is segmented into a discrete number of stones. 33 The pyramidal form itself gives the distinctive geometry and properties of a Tesla impulse coil (cf. figure 3).

Another important distinction is to be made between this genuine Tesla impulse coil and the coils commonly called Tesla coils and found in so many high schools and college physics laborato ries, but having nothing to do with this sort of electrical impulse technology. Tesla transformers are not magnetoelectri c devices, they use radiant Shockwaves, and produce pure voltage with out current. No un iversity high frequency coil must ever be called a 'Tesla coil', since the devices usually employed in demonstration halls are the direct result of apparatus perfected by Sir Oliver Lodge and not by Nikola Tesla....

In this hypothetical inte rpretation, observe how each aspect of the Tesla impulse technology finds an an alog in the basic structure of the Pyramid. â€¢ The granite stone courses function as the coil windings of the system, their resistance multiplying the voltage of the impulse output; â€¢ The granite stone blocks function as the segments of the system, multiplying the voltage of the impulse output; â€¢ The shape or geometric configuration of the system is a coil (a \"squared circle\" much like a Platonic solid) in a harmonic relationship to the system or systems to be pulsed or targeted; â€¢ The mass of the system is the mass of the granite, which is in turn a harmonic of the mass of th e base planetary system; â€¢ This mass stresses the piezo-electric properties of the granite, pulsing in resonance to the Schumann resonance of the earth 34 Vassilatos, op. cit., p. 37. 264"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star and simultaneously functioning as a capacitor building up charge when not in \"use.\" On this model, a number of pulse s would be directed by a harmonic interferometry to target, which migh t indicate the possible function of the other pyramids or some of the missing internal components of the Great Pyramid itself. When being discharg ed or \"firing,\" the Pyramid would possibly have been sheathed in a moment ary pale blue light, a plasma moving from the base of the structure to its apex, where it would simply have disappeared, reappearing as a bolt of lightening on the target, as Tesla's \"electrified air\" Shockwave, inducing an acoustic cavitation in the nuclei of the target causing a nuclear \"meltdown\" ev en in ordinary stable elements until the force of the \"acoustical Shockwave\" was dissipated. 35 But there are other peculia rities of the Great Pyra mid that Tesla's impulse technology, taken alone , cannot explain. D. Bell's Non-Locality Theorem, a nd Zero-Point Energy Engineering When one turns on a radio, one is listening to two types of energy that have become entangled: (1) a carrier wave, the radio wave itself, and (2) acoustic information encoded or modulat ed into the carrier wave. A radio transmitter combines the two types of information and a receiver disentangles them. How then would the Pyramid have di rected such energy to a target? Recall that Bell's theorem states that at the deepest level, reality is non-local, and that Bohm's version of quantum mechanics posits the existence in non- local reality of a \"pilot wave\" transcribing information to an electron at superluminal speeds. 35 I have not experimented with Tesla's impulse technology, though am aware that the engineer and inventor Eric Dollard has done so. 265"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"The Weapon Hypothesis Thus it seems reasonable to conclude that the builders of the Great Pyramid had to have known about, and moreover knew how to engineer, some version of Bell's non-locality theorem and Bohm's \"pilot wave\", because the utilization of the inertial energies of the solar system, and more importantly, the galactic system could be accessed in no other way. If those systems were harmonically coupled in the Pyramid, as all the physical evidence suggests, then the informa tion in those systems could only be accessed at superluminal speeds. Non- locality is the very basis on which those energies were not only accessed via coupled harmonic oscillation but directed to target. So in this sense the Pyramid is a great collector (hence the parabolic faces?) of this information, as well as a phase conjugator of that information. The energy of those systems does not \"t ravel\" to the Pyramid as much as the information of that energy is transcribed to it. In this sense, it is a \"mirror\" or \"receiver\". But additionally, utiliz ing the same princi ple of non-locality, the same \"aether wave\" or \"pilot wave\" most likely was used as a carrier wave for the acoustic, microwave, a nd electrical impulse output of the Pyramid. For this reason, one must not imagine that when the Pyramid was \"firing\" that bolts of energy beamed up into space, and boun ced off satellites or curled around the earth's magnetic field lines to target. Rather, the bolts of energy, if visible at all, rotated in a vortex upward over the structure, disappeared, and reappeared over the targ et, or better, inside the target. And how were these discharges directed? Harmonically, of course, by tuning or geometrically configuring the missing components - perhaps in conjunction with other structures of the compound - to guide the pilot wave to the target. Theoretically, then, any target in nearby space could have been selected, from the Indian sub-continent, to the moon, or Mars. E. The Sonoluminesence 'Effect.

(l)The Gravito-Acoustic Oscillat or and Amplification Chamber (The Grand Gallery): Its F unction and Missing Components So what might the Great Pyramid's missing components have been? What was, in fact, once inside the Grand Galle ry? I believe that Dunn is essentially correct. They were some sort of acoustic resonators, arrayed in banks that fit into the slots on the side ramps. But as Sitchin's texts indicate, they were also much more than these. I believe they were artificial crystals whose crystalline structure as well as their overall geomet ric configuration were carefully - and at great expense - engineered to be bot h optically and acoustically resonant to the three systems - terrestrial, solar, and galactic - that the Pyramid was coupled to. The Mitchell-Hedges crysta l skull is evidence that there once existed a very sophisticated knowledge of crystals. 36 This solution seems to fit the evidence adduced by Dunn and Sitchin. But this may seem rather fanciful . What could the function of such crystals possibly have been? The soluti on is simple, but breathtaking: they may have been to resonate to the acoustic harmonics of gravity itself 36 And I can now state why I always said qualified the word \"carved\" when I referred to it in chapter one, since I believe it was not carved at all, at least, not in any standard sense of bulk technology. It was more likely grown from the inside out by some process of nanotechnology. Such a technology would have allowed the construction of the types of acoustically and optically resonant crystals I am talking about here. 267"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The Weapon Hypothesis At Moscow University, Vladimir Br aginski is looking for gravity waves by monitoring tiny changes in the shape of a 200-pound sapphire crystal cylinder.

To isolate it from terrestrial noise, the Soviet sapphire is suspended by wires in a vacuum chamber and cooled to near absolute zero.... The first accurate position measurement induces via the uncertainty principle a large momentum spread. For the same reason a collection of particles with different momenta will quickly drift apart, this induced spread in the bar's momentum soon resu lts in a spread in the bar's position. Momentum just happens to be an attribute whose uncertainty feeds back into the position attribute. Braginski calls such a situation - where accurate measurement of one attribute is spoiled by the back-reaction of the Heisenberg spread in its conjugate attribute - a quantum demolition measurement. 37 The function of the Gravito-Acoustic Oscillation and Amplification Chamber (Grand Gallery) was to oscilla te and cohere, ther eby amplifying, the electromagnetic, acoustic, and inertial harmonics of the base systems and to tune them to the target to establish a resonant and cohered standing wave within the target disrupting its nuclei and destroying it.

Thus the crystal arrays are under constant stress from these three sources. Damping mechanisms attached to each of the arrays and each individual crystal would allow the chamber to be tuned to the electrom agnetic, acoustic, and gravitational properties of the target. The gravito-acoustic properties are accessed via two means: (1) the quantum scattering effects of each of the crystals, and (2) the difference in height from the center of the earth and corresponding slight variation in the acceleration of gravity at th e varying heights of each of the crystal arrays. Once the scalar potential of the target has been stru ctured in the Chamber, its gravito-acoustic and electroma gnetic output is conveyed to the Amplification Chamber for fine tuning and thence to the King's Chamber.

Their names, now of course corrupted in transmi ssion, perhaps originally designated the harmonic and physical action or energy to be oscillated. 38 That is, the names of the arrays pr eserved in paleographic texts cited by Sitchin would be the names ascribed to the functions of the arrays by less 269"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"The Weapon Hypothesis These resonators were artificial crystals - perhaps in liquid form - constructed to be resonant to the co rresponding gravity or pilot wave of any quantum interaction and any configuration of the base systems.

The st ones in each array in between these two poles may have oscillated other colors of the visible light spectrum, since Sitchin's texts indicate that the interior of the chamber was once bathed in \"a rainbow of colors.\" Given this statement, one has a basis on which to speculate about what other crystals might have been included in these arrays. The inclusion of ruby and sapphire (possibly in PHI \"Dark Crystal\" form, cf. below, section 3, \"the PHI Crystals') poses an interesting problem touching both upon the principles of the unified paleophysics and upon the quest for unification in modern physics.

The function of the lattice structure is therefore apparent: It also serves as an amp lification device for the acoustic energy down to the molecular, atomic, and quantum levels. The connection between gravity and electromagnetism is assumed throughout the unified quaternion phys ics of Maxwell. The connection between gravity and acoustics, however, is a fundamental supposition of the paleophysics examined in The Giza D eath Star, with its emphasis on harmonics. Besides being well documented in esot eric traditions, th is connection is currently a matter of serious scientific investigation. \"Acoustic levitation\" is the technique used to levitate an object by high-powered sounds, being used and proposed as a means of fueling ta rgets in thermal nuclear reactions. 45 The use of piezoelectric effect in the Gravito-acoustic crystal arrays of the Chamber are explainable in terms of contemporary theory. One example of \"physical\" acoustic study is about phonons, or the quanta of mechanic energy in a crystal lattice.... To my knowledge, crysta l acoustics, as the acoustical study of phonons is called, uses excitation methods that are not \"useful\" in (a) conventional sense.... A crysta l acoustician expects to introduce synchronized or coherent phonons by mechanical or photonic means. 46 Several points emerge from careful consideration of Dr. Liu's remarks: 45 Y. Liu, \"Acoustics, an Unofficial Introduction, <www.stemnet.nf.ca/~yliu/acoustics.html>, p. 5. 46 Ibid., p. 5, emphasis added . 276"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star â€¢ The conventional \"non-usefulness\" strongly suggests that a military application is being sought.

The piezoelectric effect is being employed to access the poten tial gravito-ac oustic energy. The connection betwee n acoustics and gravity 47 is stressed by Dr. Liu as follows (the numbered points do not occu r in his text, but are provided in order to facilitate the commentary that follows): (1) Acoustic levitation has many ad vantages including its high controllability and good manipulation capabilities. (2) Acoustic levitation was fi rst experimentally veri fied in the 40s, but received intensive study only since Dr. T.G. Wang proposed its application in space material processing in 1979.

According to the formation of the field, there are uniaxial, triaxial, and focused field technique. The following implications occur with each enumerated point: 47 It bears reapeating that noted electro-gravitics research physicist Thomas Townsend Brown also spent time researching the acoustic properties of rocks. 48 Ibid., p. 6. 277"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"The Weapon Hypothesis â€¢ The phenomenon is targetable, i.e., targeting occurs through harmonic interferometry, tending to confirm the hypothesis being advanced here. â€¢ It is used to engineer materials not possible in terrestrial gravity. â€¢ The involvement of the Jet Propul sion Laboratory, the Marshal Space Center, Lawrence-Livermore Laboratory as well as two major defense contractors (General Electric and Westinghouse), and two academic institutions with strong defense a nd intelligence connections suggests the militarization of the phenomenon for: â€¢ Kontrabaric (anti-grav ity) Propulsion (NASA) â€¢ Materials engineering â€¢ Weaponization. So one may be permitted to hypothesize that the missing components, the \"magic stones\" or \"crystals\" of Sitchin' s texts, were some very sophisticated gravito-acoustic resonator assembly co mprised of artific ially engineered crystals designed to resonate to the harmonics of gravity. 49 And another word is necessary. Recall that in Sitchin's texts the \"Destiny\" stone emitted a red radiance that Ninurta recorded as ha ving a \"strong power\" that was used \"to grab to pull me, with a trac king which kill s to seize me.\" 50 Such a function would be fulfilled by sapphires or rubies. And there is something else that must be noted. In Dunn's version of the machine hypothesis, the inte rnal temperatures of the Pyramid would have been great, but not so great that the gr anite would have melted, as indicated by the melted Coffer and scorched limestone in the Grand Gallery. Cold fusion can take place at room temperatures. Pe rhaps the Pyramid's, more or less constant 49 Needless to say, our current physics does not yet have an experimentally validated and fully developed knowledge of the harmonics of gravity.

Not only was the design acoustically necessary as an amplification chamber, but gravitically necessary for accurate measures at different harmonically determined lengths from the center of the earth's mass. If this is so, then it stands to reason that at least some of these crystals were artificial sapphires and rubies. Needless to say, the discovery of any such crystalline artifacts of precise cons truction, resonance and appropriate age would constitute an extremely important archaeological find and a corroboration of this hypothesis. (2) The Coffer: Sitchin's texts also indicate components are missing from the inside of the Coffer. Perhaps, in addition to cohering the microwave input as an optical cavity, there were further devices inside of it that aided in the guidance or phasing of the output beam to couple it with the impulse discharge of the Pyramid-coil itself. (3) The Subterranean Chamber(s): Devices may have been placed here to \"prime\" the Pyramid, as Dunn suggests. Moreover, it is possible that some sort of instrumentation and machinery was placed here in order to \"tune\" and target the weapon properly and accurately. 279"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"The Weapon Hypothesis (4) The Other Two Large Pyramids, The \"Causeways\", and the \"Temples\" As Dunn indicates, the other structures at Giza may have been used to \"prime\" the Pyramid, and perhaps to ai m it. It may be significant that the \"causeways\" leading to the three large pyramids, and the \"temples\" may have housed the necessary machinery to ac quire a target and \"aim\" the weapon itself. G. A Phase Conjugate Howitzer So, what kind of weapon, after all, was the Great Pyramid, and how did it work? It was an extremely sophisticated \" phase conjugate mirror\" and \"phase conjugate howitzer\" designed to colle ct, amplify, and cohere the acoustic, electromagnetic, nuclear, and \"aetheri c\" or gravitational energy of sub- quantum local (i.e. terrestrial, solar, and galactic) space-time to a target in such a fashion that each of these severa l different types of energy arrived at the target at the same time and exactly in phase, harmonically, with the target. The \"aetheric\" energy, since it is the en ergy of non-local real ity, functioned as the carrier wave or beam for the othe r forms of energy, guiding them to the target through hyperspace. With proper \"tuning\" of the weapon, any target, anywhere on earth or nearby space, could be selected. This superluminal carrier wave accelerated the electrom agnetic, acoustic, and gravitational energy to the target. Once the target had been selected and its harmonics were known, the weapon would have been tuned to hit it by properly tuning and configuring its missing internal components in conjunc tion with the other structures. Depending on what effect was desired in the target, one of two things could be done. A point in local space-time n ear or around the target would have been pulsed, releasing a violent discha rge of electro-acoustical energy to the target. Accelerating the acoustical wave via this aetheric and electromagnetic discharge, a violent acous tic cavitation would be 280"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star induced within the nuclei of its atoms until the target consumed itself in a violent nuclear reaction. And becaus e of the nature of the weapon, any material would do to set off that reacti on. Wood, steel, or plastic would have been just as violently blown ap art as uranium 235 or Plutonium. Alternatively, the target could simply have been \"slowly cooked\", ionizing it altogether, a result no less violent, but c onsiderably \"cleaner\". In either case, the pilot wave carries the electromagnetic and acoustic energy effortlessly into the nucleus, where those energies are accelerated to induce the cavitation. The horror of such a weapon cannot be imagined. There would have been no radar warnings of incoming bomb s, no tracks of blinking lights on oscilloscopes to watch. There would be little change in weather or atmospheric conditions to warn th e victims of impending doom - save enormous electrical discharges paling the largest thunders torms - unless its commanders wished to give it. Ther e would be no infrared or other electromagnetic signature until it was almo st too late. There would have been no moon-sized objects appearing in the sky over the target blasting it apart with enormous lasers; no saucers with gaping maws charging up capacitors and firing bolts of plasma at some an cient Empire State Building. And most importantly, after its use - always deadly, and always efficient - there would have been no more target, for it would have become the nuclear fuel, the critical mass, of its own consumption and ripped itself apart in a nuclear paroxysm of such violence that we can only imagine. Within certain limits, such a weapon could be calibrated to produce now a smaller, and now a much larger, blast, depending on how wide an area destruction was sought.

Who Built It? \"We may well discover that we are the Martians. \" Richard C. Hoagland A. Specialized Knowledge One thing that is persistent in almo st any ancient mythological text or tradition is the universal belief in \"gods\" each possessed of specific and precisely delineated \"powers.\" From Australia to North and South America to the Near and Far East, the \"gods\" are gods \"of the air\", \"of the sea\", \"of the spirits,\" \"of oak\" or \"of trees\" or \"o f light\" and so on. There are gods of wisdom, gods of rivers, forests, winds, seas, oceans, fire, cold and virtually every other physical process or object we can think of. The normal response is to dismiss these traditions as eith er religiously or morally backward examples of primitive polytheism or pantheism, or the scientific illiteracy of primitive and backward cultures. But I believe that there is nothing about our most ancient myths and traditions that is as it seems on the surface. Indeed, if there once existed a paleoancient Very High Civilization, as I believe the physics of the Great Pyramid demonstrates, then almost not hing about human history from the period of the demise of that Civiliza tion to the appearance of the ancient civilizations of classical history can be taken for granted. And the poly- or pantheistic mythologies are no exception. That being said, what do such myths in fact preserve from that paleoancient Very high Civilization? The answer may be discovered by extending the principle of paleographic interpretation of ancient texts that were employed in our examination of paleophysics and the archaeological evidence for a sophisticated ancient technology. If there was once a sophisticated \"paleophysics\", then one may assume that this paleophysics was as equally specialized into various sub-disciplines as our own, if not 282"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star more so. And by extension of that id ea, one may assume that all of its science, art, and religion were similarly sophisticated, and compartmentalized. Specialists would therefore have ex isted within each department of knowledge. A \"wisdom-god\" such as th e Egyptian god Thoth might very well have been nothing more than a \"minister of the department of research and development.\" An \"ocean-god\" a h ead of oceanography, and so on. The myths, after all, describe beings e ither superintending physical processes, specialized (meaning perh aps theoretical) knowledge, or human affairs, and sometimes mixtures of the three. And this suggests a putative history, al beit a simplistic one, as to why the collective human memory of that period should have gone from humans in an advanced society, to \"gods.\" The first step would have been taken in the period immediately after the demise of the paleoancient Very High Civilization. The men who ran, coordinated, and ultimately presided over the demise of the Civilization may have been referred to as being \"men like as gods\". The simile is remarkably preserve d in the story of the fall of man in Genesis, for example. The second step, as humanity slid further into backwardness as the infrastructure of the old civilization collapsed, would have been simply to transform the simile into a metaphor: \"Men were gods.\" And the final step would be simply to drop the metaphor altogether: \"There were once gods.\" The historical progression was thus the converse of the three-step program of French sociologist Auguste Comte. Comt e, looking at the historical progress of man from the classical to the modern age, characterized the movement in terms of three broad epochs defined by the prevailing method employed to view the universe. These stages we re the \"religious, metaphysical, and scientific\" ages. So the converse broa d historical outline seems to have occurred some time in the remote pa st of human antiquity, in a movement from the scientific, to the metaphysical, to the religious age. This seems to be vindicated by the fact that here and th ere, in certain texts such as the Hermetica, the Hindu Epics, or the Sanskrit \"vimana\" texts, 283"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Who Built It? the outlines of vast technological and scientific sophistication are clearly preserved in spite of an evident overgro wth of the other two ages. But there is another aspect of those ancient myths and traditions that must also be accounted for. B. Long A verage Life Spans Virtually every religious tradition from the ancient Near East has some tradition that mankind once lived much longer on average than he does now. The Babylonian texts, for example, attribute life spans of hundreds of thousands of years to man or the \"gods\", and the Old Testament, as is well known, also ascribes much longer life spans to humans. In some cases, life- spans of almost a millenium are reported. Typically, the response of mainstream research is to regard thes e reports as fanciful, as some kind of allegorical device to record the power of the gods or the venerable wisdom of ancestral forefathers. But what if these reports, too, are the legacy of some paleoancient Very High Civilization? What if they in fact are true? It takes no great imagination to see how this might be possible. Al ready our own scientists are talking about the potentials of nano-technology 1 to repair the human body at the cellular level, cell by individual cell. Othe rs refer to the st unning advances in genetics and the new and extremely powerful genetically based drugs and therapies for battling - and probably curing - diseases such as AIDS or cancer or even diabetes. Still others speak of \"combinational\" technologies that combine biological and mechanical tec hniques to open up a whole new vista for prosthetics. And just around the corner, one can e nvision the cu lturing and growth of genetically compatible organs for transplant when old organs \"wear out.\" Man's technological quest 1 i.e., the ability to manipulate and engineer reality at a molecular and atomic level by the construction of very tiny molecular-sized machines preprogrammed to perform certain functions, like tiny robots. Already scientists at AT&T have constructed the first artificial atom. 284"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star for virtual immortality appears poised on the cusp of stunning achievements. So it is not difficult to imagine that our paleoancient Very High Civilization might have possessed the end results of technolo gies we are only just beginning to develop. And the imp lications of their possession of such technologies would have had a prof ound influence on the shape of their society and its cultural values. (1) Rapid Scientific and Technological Progress Obviously, the first important area wh ere greatly expanded average life spans - in the hundreds or perhaps thous ands of years - would have had a tremendous impact would be in the rapid accumulation and growth of knowledge. Once a civilization had mastered the techniques of nanotechnology and advanced genetic pharmacology and therapy, life spans would have increased, and with them, the accumulation of knowledge by individual members in a society would have grown exponentially. No longer would education have had the same \"life and death\" importance that it has for us. Consider that every seventy years or so, all of humanity has to recycle all of its accumulated knowledge and pass it on to succeeding generations, and do so in a way that allows continued scientific and tec hnological progress. Accordingly, our advancement in sc ience and technology has proceeded at what amounts to a cultural snail's p ace. Our most famous scientists, for example, are known for one or two majo r discoveries or accomplishments in their lives. Then, they die. Consider also that with much longer life spans, scientists would perhaps be famous for vast, encyclopedic accumu lations of discoveries. A culture and society in such a position would therefore be a societ y awash in the luxury of the leisure of being able to absorb such discoveries a nd progress within a single generation, and to press forward fr om them dramatically. It would be a society and culture whose knowledge is simultaneously very specialized and compartmentalized, much like our own. But unlike 285"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Who Built It? our own, the scientific breadth and de pth of knowledge available to the non- specialist would be exponentially larger. Scientific literacy would be as much a staple to it as politic al, economic, or artistic literacy are to our own. (2) Lower Population Density With longer life spans, however, co mes a cultural and perhaps even evolutionary consequence. On the one si de, the human libido being what it is, one may speculate that strict measur es would have been implemented to control population. Of course, if a so ciety were as advanced as our paleoancient Very High Civilization, then this problem might not be all that serious. For example, as we have seen it doubtless relied on entirely different understandings of energy. It would not ha ve been necessary for it to deplete the earth of various resources in order to fuel its en ergy needs, which, in any case, were probably too large for any am ount of merely terrestrial resources to meet. Secondly, a such a highly adva nced technological society would also imply a commensurately greater agricultural a nd food technology. But all that being said, however, one is still left with human urges and libido, and so population density would have been a problem that it would have dealt with. What such measures would have been established one can only guess at. Perhaps some so rt of program of enforced family sizes such as exists in modern China would have been mandated. We simply do not know. But there is also anothe r possibility at the oppos ite end of the spectrum that should not be overlooked. With greatly expanded life spans, the biological necessity for procreation might have produced some sort of evolutionary response within the human species. In short, humanity might have suffered a commensurate loss of sex drive. Either way, what all this adds up to is that the paleoancient Very High Civilization was a society with a populat ion density that was probably much less than our own. Large cities there probably 286"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"The Giza Death Star were, but with the type of science and technology available to it, the need for them would have been correspondingly diminished. (3) Its Global Extent and the Absence of a \"Third World\" Its population density was probably ther efore not only less than our own, but far more uniformly di stributed. The distinction between rural and urban populations and classes would probably not have been as great nor as perceptible. And needless to say, the type of technology and science implied also means that there would have been no geopolitical distinction between the First, Second, or Third Worlds. There would have been but First World. This has a profound moral consequence that will be examined below. C. The Civilization Types The brilliant American theoretical physicist Michio Kaku reproduces an intriguing classification of civilizat ions based upon the types of physical forces they can access, control, and manipulate. It might be expected that only a more advanced civilization, with cast resources at its disposal, would have been capable of discovering the unified field theory. The astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, for example, has ranked advanced civilizations into three types: Type I civilizations, which control the resources of an entire planet; type II civilizations, which control the resources of a star; and type II civilizations, which control the resources of an entire galaxy. On this scale, technologically we are still on the threshold of achieving type 1 status. A true type 1 civiliza tion would be able to perform feats far beyond the scope of present-day technology. For example, a type I civilization could not only predict the weather but control it. A type I civilization could make the Sahara desert bloom, harness the power of hurricanes for energy, change the course of rivers, harvest crops form the oceans... A type I civilization would be able to peer into the earth, predict of create earthq uakes, and extract rare minerals and oil from inside the earth.... 287"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Who Built It? The transition to a type II civilizati on, which can utilize and manipulate the power of the sun, may take several thousan d years... a type II civilization could colonize the solar system and perhaps a few neighboring ones...and begin to build gigantic machines that can manipulate the greatest energy source in the solar system: the sun... The transition to a type III civilizati on, which can harness the resources of a galaxy, stretches our im agination to the limit. 2 Based on these criteria, one can only conc lude that the type of civilization that built the Great Pyramid was at the very least a type II, if not a type III, civilization, for the energy being manipulat ed in the Pyramid is precisely the energy of the sun, and even of the ga laxy. That civilization was manifestly not the civilization of ancient Egypt, but something that must of necessity have predated it. Kardashev's classification scheme and Kaku's interpretation of it is suggestive for another reason as well. Di d the civilization that built the Great Pyramid have the capacity for interplanetary travel? The physics postulated for the Giza Death Star certainly seems to suggest that it did. But is there corroborative evidence? I believe there is, and it is on Mars, where a Sphinx-like face and pyramidal structures peer up at us from the surface of our nearest neighbor. Richard C. Hoagland, who has done so much to advance the hypothesis of a once-civilized Mars and the physics of the society that existed there, 3 said it best. \"We may well discover th at we are the Martians.\" This suggests another interesting me thod for verification of the weapon hypothesis, should we ever make a ma nned landing on the red planet. If the Mars-Cydonia monuments are the product of the same civilization that built the Great Pyramid, we should expect to find internal chambe rs to the D & M Pyramid and/or other pyramids on Mars to serve some similar machine-like or weapon function. Moreover, those stru ctures may well have their internal 2 Michio Kaku and Jennifer Thompson, Beyond Einstein: the Cosmic Quest for the Theory of the Universe (New York: Anchor Books, 1987), pp. 198-199. 3 Cf.

That, of course , would be the ultimate verification, for it would tell us, once a nd for all, what type of machine and/or weapon the Great Pyramid was. Suffice it to say, how ever, that Hoagland and others have presented ample evidence that a sophisti cated new physics of energy is at the very minimum being encoded in the m onuments of Mars, if not manipulated and controlled. The evidence at Giza, of course, would indicate control and manipulation. D. The Moral Condition The most interesting aspect of this type of civilization and the most deep- seated impact of its scientific and te chnological prowess would have been on its moral condition. That it would have been a culture of great leisure seems rather obvious from the previous considerations. However, there is a much more serious moral consequence stemming directly from a greatly expanded life spa n. The fourth century Christian father and bishop of Constantinople, St. John Chrysostom, once remarked that death was not only a punishment for sin but a remedy for it. And what he meant was simply that death was what set ma n apart from the angels and daemons because it cut off any further progress in evil. His observation seems much more timely now than it did then, for a greatly expanded life span w ould mean one of two things for an individual in such a society. Either it would permit great moral progress in and toward the good, or great moral decay and \"progre ss\" in evil. Imagine an Albert Schweitzer or a Mother Teresa having t housands of years to do their work, or, conversely, an Adolf Hitler or a Joseph Stalin, and one has a picture of the moral condition that such a society might be in. The contrasts between good and evil both on an individual and on a societal basis woul d be very acute. There are, however, other moral cond itions to consider. A civilization possessed of very long average life spans would be, as has been said, a civilization of leisure. In a certain sense perhaps, 289"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Who Built It? it would be a civilization easily bored, w ith its constituent societies quick to take offense at minor insults or faults , or indeed, quick to find offense when none was intended. It would be, perhaps, a civilization of societies awash in petty jealousies and rivalries that could erupt, via their technological sophistication, with genocidal ferocity. It is this aspect that I find so unsettling, beyond the implications of the Giza Death Star itself. Read a certain wa y, the ancient mythologies seem to us to be inexplicable. The gods of the myths more often than not display a pettiness, jealousy, and superficiality of moral vision that, even to our own culture's morally decayed standards, seems totally disproportionate to the power that they wield. But viewed another way, of course, th e \"gods\" were not go ds at all, but men, and seen against the context of th is hypothetical reconstruction of their civilization, their acti ons seem all too typical. A nd from what we have said throughout this book, we can see at least one monument on earth remains from a period when there was great pr ogress in evil. The technology that made that civilization - and its mainte nance - possible was twisted and turned against it in a breathtaking military application and a spasm of global destruction that - if one is to take se riously other ancient traditions - spilled over into environmental catastrophe. It is chilling indeed to contemplate that the name of the supremely fallen one in the Judeo-Christia n tradition is Lucifer, the \"light-bearer,\" the preternaturally intellig ent being whose special knowledge and \"expertise\" lies, after all, in electromagnetic phenomena. 290"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" King's Chamber."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" The Giza Pyramid Complex from 4,000 Feet.
