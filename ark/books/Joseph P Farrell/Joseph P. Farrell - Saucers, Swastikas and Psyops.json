It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources intothe building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military,diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Itspreparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, notheadlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure isquestioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.

In it, we will entera Hall of Mirrors filled with fog, for unlike all of my other books, this is noteven a case of argued speculation; it is rather more like the Cliff Notesversion of a very complicated story, told with footnotes. Imagine a world inchaos; there is economic displacement; the richer get richer, more idle, andmore corrupt, insane with the lust for power and yet, addle-minded and scarcelyable to coordinate the grand schemes by which they presume to enslave the world.There is rising resentment against them. Violence against the old order stepsinto the streets. Chaos reigns and there is a growing longing and yearning for areturn to order, peace, and stability. Now imagine that, into this picture,steps a break-away civilization, propelled by ancient doctrines and an advancedand almost magical technology. This underground, breakaway civilization stepsinto the previously described chaotic condition, promising brotherhood, peace,prosperity, and to share its advanced and almost magical technologies; all ofthis, it says, can be ours, if we but trust its peaceful intentions andleadership, and abandon our warlike ways.No. I am not talking about our “space brothers” here, nor about our situation atthe beginning of the second decade of the twenty-first century of the thirdmillennium, but about the Nazis, the world’s first “breakaway” civilization,representing an underground stream from which it emerged, and to which, upon theconclusion of the world’s biggest and bloodiest war, it returned again. In that,there lies a tale, the tale contained, in part, in this book.You are about to embark on reading a book populated by a whole host of bizarrecharacters, strange concepts, and sources that are of dubious standing, fromNeo-Nazis, to famous early UFO “contactees,” to more reputable sources such asengineers in the loftiest reaches of the military-industrial complex, tenuredhistorians in academia, UFO logists, and the even stranger relationships betweenall of them. For the past few years now, I have written a series of booksexploring exotic Nazi technology and have attempted to rationalize itsachievements on the basis of terrestrial science and engineering principles thatwere known at the time. In pursuing this story, I have also attempted to surveyin many previous books the implications of this technology for history.In presenting the conclusions of this research throughout those books,1 and thenas a guest speaker at some conferences, I have invariably been asked by acertain type of what may best be called “UFO-ET religionist” if all thisexplosion of technology during the Nazi era was not best explained by themhaving recovered a crashed UFO and reverse-engineered it. Needless to say, afterhaving written several books on the Nazi Bell story and attempting torationalize its various details as best as I can, I find such questionsirritating at one level and—to be honest—insulting at another, for why bother toresearch the subject at all if any claims for the existence of an exotictechnology, Nazi or otherwise, is to be explained by such a procedure?Yet, the questions did raise to my mind a disturbing possibility concerning thestatements of the Nazi scientists made after the war, when they were pressed toaccount for the extraordinary development of technology during the Third Reich’sthankfully short twelve-year existence, statements quickly pointed out to me bythe faithful apologists of the extraterrestrial hypothesis of UFOs. One such UFOfundamentalist, indignant that I should question the Roswell extraterrestrialdogma and the self-appointed magisterium defending it, confronted me with thereverse-engineering hypothesis, i.e., that the Nazis had recovered a crashedextraterrestrial UFO and had reverse engineered it. When I responded that Isimply did not accept that explanation, he then pointed out that both Drs. VonBraun and Oberth indicated that the Nazis had “had help” from “out there.” Thishe did as if playing a high trump card that would carry the day and end anydiscussion of entirely terrestrial explanations for Nazi technologicalachievements. To my rejoinder—that I did not see how Von Braun’s and Oberth’srockets could possibly represent advanced reversed engineered extraterrestrialsaucer technology recovered from a crashed UFO (for which there is butthreadbare evidence to begin with), and to my rejoinder that why should we trustNazis or anything they said after the war when we did not trust them before orduring it—he had no response, other than to say “Well, then, why did they makethat statement?”The question hovered over the end of our conversation as we explored variousideas, and indeed, the question has long bothered me as well, and my suspicionhas always been, that the answers of the postwar Paperclip Nazis weredeliberately disingenuous—not entirely false, but not entirely true—and thatthey may have been made in the service of some hidden agenda, an agenda that canonly be qualified as a psychological operation and disinformation campaign.That, in part, is what this book is about.Anyone familiar with the subject of UFOlogy from the immediate postwar periodinto the early and mid-1950s, will at once be aware of some peculiar things, notthe least of which is the curious resemblance between the “spaceships” 1950scontactee George Adamski, and the alleged Nazi saucer called the “Hannebu.” Ihave long maintained, in numerous interviews and in private conversations, thatthe latter is, at best, a bit of misdirection and at worst, disinformation forwhich there is no clear chain of evidence for the documents that purport tocertify it. But the question remains: why the resemblance in the first place?Other questions only heighten the dilemma.For example, why are Adamski’s “extraterrestrials” entirely human in appearance?Why are a small number of other early UFO contactee reports explicit in theirclaims that their occupants spoke German?2 What is the nature of the “message”these occupants are communicating to the contactees? And why pick thoseparticular contactees to begin with? And who are their associates?And most importantly, why—if the stories of the Nazi Bell device and otheradvanced aerodyne technologies emanating from the Third Reich are true—did thatnation pursue both technologies: the obsolescent rocket technology of VonBraun’s V-2s, and the exotic technologies represented by the alleged Nazisaucers and, more importantly, the Bell device?As I concluded in my previous book The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, these twovery disparate types of technologies seemed to resemble the outlines of twonascent space programs, one, a “secret” one employing rockets and otherconventional technologies, and another, a genuinely secret one, one lying intruly abyssal black depths of classification, employing much more exotictechnologies with, perhaps, an entirely different agenda. So, why assert thatall the public technology, came from “ETs” after the war? We are dealing with atwo track space program, and an extraterrestrial mythology. The question is:why?The answer to that question is also, in part, what this book is about.But if there is such a two-track program, the question is why? Why go to suchlengths and expenditure? What is the agenda?Part of the answer is contained in the title of this work itself: Saucers,Swastikas, Psyops: A History of a Breakaway Civilization: Hidden AerospaceTechnologies and Psychological Operations. For our purposes here, the two keywords in the title are “hidden technologies” and “psychological warfare.” In themain text of this work, I mean “psychological warfare” to encompass all thetechniques employed by intelligence agencies (and for that matter, advertizingagencies and corporations) to manage perceptions. But as the psychologicaloperations component of the title also suggests, we are here concerned with theactivities of that breakaway civilization as well.In the case of perception management our principal foci in the coming pages willbe twofold, as we shall discover a certain amount of evidence that suggests thatperceptions are being managed for two purposes: > 1) a “narrow” purpose of the concealment of various technologies being tested> in public, or being accidentally seen by the public, and to manage the> interpretation of what it is seeing. In this case, there are two types of> technologies possibly being seen, implying that two possible “programs” are> being tested or deployed in closely-held circumstances:> a) technologies implying advanced physics principles, whether those> principles have to deal with aerospace, aerodynamic, or other fields of> physics and technical applications;> b) technologies implying a biological or even genetic program (which> unfortunately is beyond the immediate scope of this book); and,> c) this concealment may also be for the purpose of hiding an actual covert> war being waged in part by means of these programs by, and against,> “whomever”;> 2) a much broader “cultural” purpose of the implanting of certain “memes” in> society at large, memes inclusive of extraterrestrials, invasions, abductions,> apocalyptic scenarios, revelations (or, to call it by its popular term within> ufology, “disclosure”).Others have written about various aspects of these problems, but the only oneswho have attempted to combine them into a large and coherent picture ofscholarly examinations of the record are the seminal and critically importantworks of Richard Dolan and Dr. Jacques Vallee. It seems to me, therefore, that a fresh approach was warranted, taking intoaccount the possible Nazi component of this breakaway ci civilization, not somuch to displace the works of these scholars and researchers, but rather, tosupplement them with more information, and with the exposition of thepossibilities of new connections between already well-known dots, and by delvingeven deeper into the mystery of why so many of these possibilities andconnections seem to originate in the dark and terrible time and place of theThird Reich.As always, my thanks to my dear friend George Ann Hughes of The Byte Show forendless prayers and encouragement.

Stranges in a self-published pamphletentitled Nazi UFO Secrets and Bases Exposed (I.E.C. Publishing Company: 1982).While Stranges’ work must be evaluated against its non-critical repetition ofthe whole Hannebu-Vril Nazi flying saucer legend, it is worth nothing what herecords of another alleged UFO contact event involving German-speakingoccupants:> “The following event took place in Reno, Nevada, during a UFO Convention, July> 1966, at the Centennial Coliseum.> “This ‘Amalgamated Flying Saucer Clubs of America’ Convention included leading> researchers: Wayne Aho, Orfeo Angelucci, Dr. Dan Fry, Carl Anderson, George> Van Tassel, Gabriel Green, and myself, Dr. Frank E.

The alleged Hannebu-Vril field propulsionsaucers were the core of the story. Resuming: > “He then requested that I brief him on the ‘German UFO Crash’ that took place> in Helgoland, West Germany.

But if true (andit’s a mighty big if), a question immediately occurs: why do we not hear of suchreports in the UFOlogy community?

Kennedy1Imagine a civilization here on earth that exists covertly inside and alongsideof those we know about, with access to the most advanced technologies,technologies straight off the drawing boards of Hollywood production companiesand special effects artists, a civilization with nearly bottomless sources offunding, staging events for the gullible, torturing others and driving them intomental and emotional breakdown, and waging a covert war with its own membersusing its own “apocalyptic technologies,” and masking that war behind theperfect plausible deniability: mother nature. This breakaway civilization,moreover, has its own ideology, and its own dubious “morality”, as was evidencedby its first real incarnation: Nazi Germany. Unlike Nazi Germany, or for thatmatter, civilizations in general, it has no “core area” where it is centered; itcomprises not one nation, but many; its peoples are drawn from all groups andlanguages, for it speaks but one language, the language of power. It is, inpart, the resurrection of Atlantis, and in part, like a bad nightmare version ofsuperhero comic books, with the villains, and not the superheroes, possessingall the superhuman powers and technologies.If the idea of such a breakaway civilization sounds fanciful or even absurd,then hold on, because this book attempts to outline its components, structure,and initial postwar history.The concept of such a breakaway civilization is intimately tied, moreover, tothe subject of UFOs, for it was first propounded by the well-known and scholarlyufologist Richard M. Dolan, in his landmark documents study UFOs and theNational Security State.A. The Breakaway Civilization Concept of Richard M. Dolan Dolan first mentions the idea of a breakaway civilization with implied access toadvanced aerospace technologies in connection with the well-known phenomenon ofUFOs “buzzing” the various defense installations of the U.S.A. and othercountries, and with it, he begins to suspect, and then to dismiss, a Naziconnection: > Is one to believe that this was a demonstration of secret Nazi power emanating> from Antarctica? No tangible evidence has ever emerged to support this thesis.> Or, were all the early UFOs manufactured by the Americans and Soviets? If so,> who was buzzing the American military pilots and bases with such regularity?> Since there is no evidence that it was the Soviets, does this mean that a> secret American flying saucer program was charged with provoking an> unsuspecting American defense establishment? For more than fifty years? No> proponent of the man-made UFO thesis has been able to come to terms with this> issue, although one could do it by postulating the existence of a completely> separate breakaway civilization. 2Dolan is, of course, entirely correct: no evidence of any secret Nazi flyingsaucer research base has ever been forthcoming from Antarctica, or, for thatmatter, anywhere else. Indeed, as this author has observed on numerousoccasions, such a base would have required enormous electrical power, if theNazi Bell project is any measure, for that project required an entire electricalpower plant to be built close to its test installations,3 a fact ruling outAntarctica as a source for such craft. Additionally, construction of such aresearch center would have taxed the German Navy—or any other navy for thatmatter—beyond its operational and logistical resources during World War Two, andwould have required a large logistical effort to support it after the war,resources that the postwar Nazi organization did not have.These caveats notwithstanding, Dolan speculates further on the parameters thatsuch a conception implies: > If we also consider the possibility of covert breakthroughs in propulsion> technology, and the “off the grid” nature of the deep-black world itself, we> come to the possibility that we are dealing with, in effect, a “breakaway> civilization.” One with loose connections at various points to the open> civilization of humanity, but, with great independence, secrecy, and a> monopoly of certain key scientific secrets. The history of the Cold War showed> that separate infrastructures could, to some extent, evolve. Western politics,> economy, science, and culture developed along paths that were very different> from those in the Soviet Union or China. Important breakthroughs occurred in> secrecy—stealth being a prominent example. Granted, the level of separation> implied for a breakaway civilization would be vastly greater than any Cold War> examples. In principle, however, such a development is possible, and> responsible research must consider the strength of the supporting evidence and> clues.4Note the things that Dolan implies are clear markers of such a civilization: > 1) It has “loose connections at various points” to the open civilization(s) of> humanity;> 2) It possesses “great independence” from them;> 3) It is secret, that is to say, its structure, components, and activities are> largely hidden from the open civilizations of humanity; and finally and most> importantly,> 4) It holds a monopoly over certain scientific concepts and the technologies> that result from them.These points form the structural outline of this book, for we will investigatethe points of overlap or contact between this “breakaway civilization”, itsputative structure, components, or factions, and activities, and the impliedscientific concepts and technologies, with a view to arguing a prima facie casethat such a breakaway civilization indeed exists. Additionally, our contentionwill be that this civilization is fundamentally Fascist in its outlook andideology.For Dolan, the concept of a breakaway civilization is intimately connected tothe subject of UFOs and, moreover, the persistent stories and evidence that atleast some UFO artifacts were recovered. It is worth citing Dolan’s remarks hereat length: > It looks as though the UFO secret involved more than mere knowledge of the> presence of aliens of some sort. During the 1970s and 1980s, researchers made> a strong case that alien artifacts were recovered and studied by the U.S.> military. Conceding that such exotic technology would be vastly ahead of> anything developed by human civilization, how long would it take before some> clever team of (human) scientists developed major new insights that might> transform existing technologies, or even create new fields of study> altogether? It is not evident that all black world developments would> eventually become public. On the contrary, it is entirely feasible that some> breakthroughs would in turn lead to other breakthroughs, and so on in the> manner very typical of science, in which successes build upon each other with> ever greater speed and effectiveness.> Thus, there exists the possibility of what I have come to call a “breakaway> civilization.” This would entail a situation in which black world science and> technology has reached a sufficient level beyond the “official” world, in> which its foundational areas of knowledge are so different (understanding of> non-terrestrial intelligences, spacetime, dimensionality, etc), that it can> fairly be called a separate civilization. Throughout human history, multiple> civilizations often existed simultaneously, possessing disparate levels of> technology and operating on vastly different assumptions of the world. There> is no inherent reason to doubt that something like this can happen again—or> has already happened.5Dolan is clearly implying here that his “breakaway civilization” also possessesa completely different physics—and a technology based upon it—than the publiccivilization with its known physics models and technologies. So we may add toDolan’s checklist of “indicators” of such a civilization a fifth marker: > 5) It possesses a different, and perhaps even a radically different physics> than the standard models of “public consumption” physics, and thus, possesses> different principles of engineering and technology.1. The 1988 Affair of the “Alien Reproduction Vehicle” Dolan then mentions the case of the so-called “Alien Reproduction Vehicle,” avehicle that, according to whistleblower testimony, was back-engineered fromoff-the-shelf terrestrial components to emulate the performance of an allegedcaptured alien flying saucer: > Indeed, the 1988 demonstration of the “Alien Reproduction Vehicle” (ARV)> points to the existence of such a major breakthrough. Supporting this even> further is the complete absence, even two decades later, of anything like the> ARV in the arsenal of the U.S. military. The object was reportedly described> as having gone into space on many occasions, and even to have explored the> solar system. The person who carefully observed it and described it to friends> noted that it looked as though it had been in service for a long time. This> would indicate that the ARV had nothing at all to do with U.S. military> mandates, at least not in any conventional geopolitical sense. Just as> clearly, its mission would logically have something to do with the presence of> nonhuman intelligences.6The story of the “Alien Reproduction Vehicle” or ARV was first reported by MarkMcCandlish in 1988.According to McCandlish, on November 12, 1988 a major open house and air showwas held at Norton Air Force Base in California, while at nearby Palmdale, atLockheed’s celebrated “Skunk Works” facility, three of the ARVs were on display.McCandlish, who had worked in aerospace as a conceptual artist, holding severalsecurity clearances, planned to attend but was unable to do so. The story anddescription of the ARVs was related to him by his friend Brad Sorenson, whoattended the show and saw the ARVs in Lockheed’s Skunk Works hanger because heattended the show with a high ranking Defense department personage, probably asecretary or under-secretary. Sorensen gained access by accompanying thispersonage.7McCandlish was subsequently able to verify the description of these ARVs byhearing similar and independent descriptions of a vehicle from yet anothercontact within the aerospace world, Kent Sellen.8 Sorensen, who had seen threesuch vehicles hovering above the ground, also heard a general—the rank andservice branch are unclear but it is assumed an U.S. Air Force general—speakingto a group of people. According to what Sorensen told McCandlish, the general > (Referred) to the vehicles as “Alien Reproduction Vehicles,” also as the Flux> Liner (because they used high voltage electricity). He mentioned several> fascinating features of the ARV. One was that it could perform at “light speed> or better.” Another was that it ran on energy obtained through the> vacuum—presumably the zero point energy field, better described scientifically> as the “quantum zero point fluctuations of the vacuum.” It had extraordinary> acceleration and maneuverability, able to move from a ground-level hovering> position to 80,000 feet within 2.5 seconds. It was also apparently stated that> the ARV had by this time already performed a general reconnaissance of all the> planets of the solar system in a search for life, and that no life was found.> Sorensen noted that the ARV looked “ancient” and as though it had been used> extensively.9Dolan notes that if this story is true, then it has certain implications for thehypothesis of a breakaway civilization, for “it would mean that ‘black world’science had achieved a substantial, revolutionary breakthrough on this matterwell ahead of ‘white world’ science.”10Dolan is correct, but the story also carries further implications. First, thescience behind the alleged craft use of the vacuum flux or zero point energy asan energy source—is entirely terrestrial, in other words, it is not the conceptsthat are advanced, since the idea of the zero point energy stems from work ofthe physicists in the 1930s. As I have also pointed out elsewhere, thisconception was made the central area of inquiry for a postwar Nazi fusionresearch project in Argentina in the 1950s, headed by the scientist Dr. RonaldRichter.11 Thus, we may be dealing, even with the story itself, with a layer ofdisinformation or obfuscation, for by that time, the word “alien” had come tomean, within the wider culture, “extraterrestrial,” with its original meaning,“foreign,” being left far behind.More importantly, it is to be noted that there are two things that wouldindicate, as Dolan rightly points out, that if the story is true then twobreakthroughs have occurred: (1) the “relativistic speed limit” of the velocityof light has been overcome, and (2) the craft, if it were manned (asMcCandlish’s drawings clearly show), then it would have had to generate its owngravitational field, otherwise the occupants would have been crushed to death bythe severe accelerations reported for it. The story, in other words, isconsistent with the markers of a breakaway civilization that Dolan has laiddown, whether or not the ultimate source of the technology was human orextraterrestrial.Finally, it is to be noted that the technology in question was employed for ahidden purpose, namely, the covert manned exploration of space. If so, thiswould rationalize rather well why the U.S.A. has recently sworn off any furthermanned exploration of space by means of conventional rockets; if elements withinthe U.S.A. did possess such technology, rockets are as obsolete as the PonyExpress. We thus have two more markers of a “breakaway civilization,” and these,I think, are Dolan’s real points in mentioning the story: > 6) A breakaway civilization, having monopolies over advanced technologies and> theoretical science, will likely employ that technology in covert activities;> 7) It will seek to cloak those activities, if discovered, behind stories and> fabrications of a different origin for the technologies, lest the knowledge> become accessible publicly, and end the monopoly of the breakaway> civilization.image [images/00004.jpg] Cutaway of the Alleged Alien Reproduction Vehicle Based on McCandlish’sDrawings. Note the Chairs in the Top2. How A Breakaway Civilization Might Evolve By pinpointing the world of “black projects,” Dolan is putting his finger on aunique feature of Western civilization that would allow such a breakawaycivilization to arise with comparative ease, as compared to a similardevelopment in a nation comprising a non-Western civilization. That feature isthe fact that most of the western world’s “black projects” occur in nations with(1) a broad revenue- gathering tax base, (2) a government military, asdistinguished from private or mercenary militaries, and most importantly (3)corporations contracted to do the actual research and development of thetechnologies. It is this public-private mixture that is a crucial component ofthe possibility of a breakaway civilization as we shall see.There is, however, another component, equally crucial to the development of abreakaway civilization: compartmentalization. Black projects are so tightlyorganized and compartmentalized that a low level technician, working on aparticular piece or component of a project, may not even know what thatcomponent is ultimately for, nor what others involved in the project are workingon. Only senior level managers will know the larger picture. This fact allowsthe possibility that any given project can be infiltrated or co-opted from anoutside source, infiltrating personnel into the various levels of the project.The private corporation-public military mixture characteristic is thus thefertile ground on which a breakaway civilization can grow, and the most obviouspotential candidates for the core of the breakaway civilization hypothesis wouldbe the very corporations engaged in the research themselves, and behind them,the holders of public debt securities from a given nation, if those holders becorporations or banks of sufficient size.When these two facts are considered historically, the best two candidates forthe core group or groups exercising covert control over such projects, theirtechnologies, and the military personnel engaged in using them, are thecorporate and banking centers of High Capital in the West, and the Nazis, andindeed, as we shall discover in later chapters of this book, there are abundantconnections between the two and black projects, and abundant indications thatthey employ these in a variety of black operations roles, among them,psychological operations.B. Dr. Carroll Quigley on the Markers of Civilizations However, in order to sharpen our analysis of the markers and indicators of thebreakaway civilization, it will be helpful to have a standard historiographicalapproach to the subject, and for this, no one serves our purposes better thanthe late, and famous, Georgetown Professor, Dr. Carroll Quigley. Quigley iswell-known both to conventional historians and to researchers of “conspiracytheory,” for Quigley literally wrote the “bibles” of modern conspiracy theory intwo works that outlined the vast, and largely hidden and secretive maneuveringsof international banking and corporations during the twentieth century toachieve a state of total control over the world and over the masses of humanity.These two works are The Anglo-American Establishment, and a massive—andunfootnoted—academic tome of twentieth century history, Tragedy and Hope: AHistory of the World in Our Time. In the latter book, Quigley even admits thathe was able to expose details of these secret maneuverings because he had beengiven access to the secret papers and files of the very families, banks, andcorporations involved. Quigley was even mentioned by former President BillClinton in his nomination acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic PartyNational Convention as having been one of the key figures who helped shape hisworld view, a mention that, at the time, gave conspiracy theorists much gristfor speculation.But Quigley was also the author of numerous peer-reviewed academic papers, andof yet a third book, little appreciated by conspiracy theory researchers, butwhich we shall rely upon heavily here. After all, if Quigley wrote the “bibles”for conspiracy theory in the above two works, then what he has to say about themarkers of civilizations and of their historical analysis ought to be ofimportance for analysis of the possibilities of the idea of a breakawaycivilization. That book is The Evolution of Civilizations: An Introduction toHistorical Analysis.image [images/00005.jpg] Georgetown History Professor Dr. Carroll Quigley (1910–1977)It was Quigley’s conviction “that civilization is an object that can be studiedin a scientific way just as a quartz crystal can be studied.”12 To this end,Quigley devised a number of criteria by which to analyze civilizations, and tocategorize them.1. The Six Areas of Potential and the Four Types of Groups According to Quigley, human potential organizes itself within civilizations intosix levels or categories of activity: > 1) military,> 2) political,> 3) economic,> 4) social,> 5) religious, or as we shall see in this book, ideological,> 6) intellectual.13As can be seen from this list, there are four areas already implicated in thenotion of a breakaway civilization as Dolan outlined it; these are the military,political, economic, and intellectual categories of organizing human potential.These considerations lead Quigley to an analysis of the types of groups thatform around these areas of potential. There are four types of groups:> 1) social groups,> 2) societies,> 3) producing societies, and> 4) civilizations.14With respect to the first of these categories, social groups, Quigley notes thatwhat distinguishes them from societies and civilizations proper is the fact thatmembers of groups can determine “who is in it and who is not.”15Dolan has already hinted at this unique feature of his breakaway civilizationidea, but it is worth emphasizing it here, for it is a feature that sharplydistinguishes it from civilizations in the normal sense, for by the very natureof the case, such a breakaway civilization’s members have to go through thenormal security recruitment and vetting procedures, and to a certain extent, arechosen for their carefully defined roles.This is a second distinguishing feature of the notion of a breakawaycivilization, for in the case of an ordinary civilization, one is dealing with arelatively large population, whose interactions can only be statisticallycorrelated.16 In the case of a breakaway civilization, we are dealing with amuch smaller “population”, whose members are all selected, and who performclearly defined roles, some of which we will be exploring in this book.In other words, in Dolan’s conception, we are dealing with a very differentconception of a civilization, for in it, the notion of civilization is radicallytransformed. Just how radical this is may be glimpsed by Quigley’s otheranalytical categories and markers.2. Parasitic and Producing Societies, and the Breakaway Civilization Quigley notes that there are three more essential markers of a civilization, andthese, for our purposes, are quite important: > The pattern of change in civilizations presented here consists of seven stages> resulting from the fact that each civilization has an instrument of expansion> that becomes an institution. The civilization rises while this organization is> an instrument and declines as this organization becomes an institution.> By the term “instrument of expansion” we mean that the society must be> organized in such fashion that three things are true: (1) the society must be> organized in such a way that it has an incentive to invent new ways of doing> things; (2) it must be organized in such a way that somewhere in the society> there is accumulation of surplus—that is, some persons in the society control> more wealth than they wish to consume immediately; and (3) it must be> organized in such a way that the surplus which is being accumulated is being> used to pay for or to utilize the new inventions. All three of these things> are essential to any civilization. Taken together, we call them an instrument> of expansion….The three essential parts of an instrument of expansion are incentive to invent,accumulation of surplus, and application of this surplus to the newinventions.17There are a number of crucial points here and it is best to summarize them, forthese will become the areas of our investigation in subsequent chapters.While it may seem that Quigley has presented but three characteristics of acivilization, he has in fact, presented four. There are the three obvious ones:> 1) A civilization must be so organized as to invent new things or techniques> of doing things. In terms of our analysis of a breakaway civilization, the> obvious signal of this application will be the invention of new aerospace> technologies that are, by their very nature, the products of secret research> projects;> 2) A civilization must possess a means of the accumulation of surplus. For our> purposes, this will mean that we must look for mechanisms or, as Quigley calls> them, “instruments” of funding for such inventions that are relatively stable> and secure, but, by the nature of the case, that are also relatively secret.> In this case, we shall have to look for clues as to when and how such funding> mechanisms or instruments arose, and then trace them historically as the> breakaway civilization evolved and changed to meet new circumstances. Quigley> again provides the clue of what to look for, for it is necessary to the> accumulation of surplus that there be means of capital accumulation and> investment; accordingly, we shall look for indications of covert capital> accumulation and investment.18 For our purposes, it is also worth noting that> Quigley also explicitly states that the surplus-creating instrument or> mechanisms do not “have to be an economic organization. In fact, (they) can be> any kind of organization, military, political, social, religious, and so> forth.”19 Obviously, our search will concentrate on the military instrument of> surplus accumulation;> 3) Any civilization, including a breakaway civilization, must also be> organized so that accumulated surplus is used to pay for, or utilize, the> invented technologies or techniques.These are the obvious implications of Quigley’s hallmarks of a civilization, butthere is one other, implicit at the beginning of the previous quotation: > 4) Any civilization evolves, that is, it changes to meet new circumstances,> and it also changes as instruments evolve into institutions, which, according> to Quigley, signals the beginning of the inevitable decline of that> civilization. As we shall discover, Quigley notes that this evolutionary> process of civilizations goes through seven distinct stages.It is thus necessary to take a closer look at the distinction between“instruments” and “institutions” in Quigley’s thought.3. Instruments and Institutions, and Parasitic vs. Producing Societies There are certain distinguishing features between instruments and institutionsin Quigley’s thought: > An instrument is a social organization that is fulfilling effectively the> purpose for which it arose. An institution is an instrument that has taken on> activities and purposes of its own, separate from and different form the> purposes for which it was intended. As a consequence, an institution achieves> its original purposes with decreasing effectiveness.20In other words, instruments become institutions when “the social conditionssurrounding any such organization change in the course of time,”21 leading suchinstitutions to take on a bureaucratic inertia, a life of their own, wherebythey seek to perpetuate their own power. They have become, Quigley notes,“vested interests.”22As this occurs, there occurs what Quigley calls the “tension of development,”from which one of three outcomes is possible: > …reform, circumvention, or reaction. In the first case, reform, the> institution is reorganized and its methods of action changed so that it> becomes, relatively speaking, more of an instrument and achieves its purpose> with sufficient facility to reduce tension to a socially acceptable level. In> the second case, circumvention, the institution is left with more of its> privileges and vested interests intact, but its duties are taken away and> assigned to a new instrument within the same society. …> In the third possible outcome, reaction, the vested interests triumph in the> struggle, and the people of that society are doomed to ineffective achievement> of their needs on that level for an indefinite period.23As we shall see in the coming pages, the breakaway civilization has displayedremarkable dexterity in reforming itself to changing circumstances, creatingever new instruments for the performance of surplus accumulation and invention.In his analysis of civilizations and societies, Quigley makes yet anotherimportant distinction for our purposes, namely, the distinction betweenparasitic and producing societies: > The former are those which live from hunting, fishing, or merely gleaning. By> their economic activities they do not increase, but rather decrease, the> amount of wealth in the world. The second kind of societies, producing> societies, live by agricultural and pastoral activities. By these activities> they seek to increase the amount of wealth in the world.24These are crucial to our analysis of the breakaway civilization, for as will beseen in coming chapters, the methods of its surplus accumulation are for themost part parasitic in nature with respect to other societies and civilizationsin the world, but productive with respect to itself. It thus exists as a kind oftertium quid or “mixed” civilization.4. The Five Dimensions of Civilization and the Sixfold Division of Culture For Quigley, there are five “dimensions” of civilization, and here, again, wetake careful note of these, for one of them bears direct implications for ouranalysis of the breakaway civilization and its history. Any civilization existsin the obvious three dimensions of space and a fourth dimension of time throughwhich it evolves. But the fifth dimension is that of historical analysis andabstraction itself. > All of these are easy to understand except the last. Let us look, for a> moment, at this fifth dimension of abstraction. It is clear that every culture> consists of concrete objects like clothes and weapons, of less tangible> objects like emotions and feelings, and of quite abstract things like ideas.> These form the dimension of abstraction.25This is quite the crucial point for our purposes, for Quigley was deeplyconcerned during his career to investigate the sociological consequences, theideological consequences, of the changes indueced within a civilization by itsweaponry.26 The implications for our analysis are again obvious, for the typesof technologies we shall be discussing also impose a certain worldview on howbest to utilize them to advance the causes and agendas of the breakawaycivilization. Indeed, as we shall discover, this became early on a major themeand concern as the breakaway civilization sought to distinguish itself from thevery host civilization sustaining it.In this respect, it is worth noting that for Quigley, there are six primaryareas in which a civilization’s culture manifest themselves: > 1) the intellectual, or as we shall prefer to call it, the ideological, or the> world view, that such a civilization has of itself;> 2) religious; while this may seem the farthest removed area from the concerns> of a breakaway civilization concerning itself with the invention of advanced> technologies and the accumulation of surplus to sustain this invention, as we> shall discover in the next chapter, the appearance or manifestation of> advanced technologies was very early, and deliberately, coupled with an almost> quasi-religious character in the experience and thought of one of the> earliest, and most famous (or infamous) UFO contactees;> 3) social, that is to say, the organization of the instruments of such> accumulation and invention;> 4) economic, or, for our purposes, the means of sustaining the financial> requirements of the breakaway civilization;> 5) political; and,> 6) military.27As we shall discover in the ensuing pages, the breakaway civilization blends ormixes the last two components of culture, producing a kind of societypolitically organized around a “chain of command” structure typical of militaryorganizations.5. The Seven Stages of Civilizations and “Core” vs “Peripheral” Societies The most obvious feature of civilizations is that they evolve and change to meetchanging circumstances, and here our concern will be to note how the parasiticbreakaway civilization began under certain peculiar circumstances, arising inthe Third Reich from a constellation of impulses, and then transplanted andchanged itself to meet the new circumstances of a lost war and a new host. It isat this juncture that we will note the rise of factions within that breakawaycivilization. These factions, we will discover, were present prior to the riseof that civilization in Nazi Germany, and re-emerged after the war, when thebreakaway civilization reestablished contact with its separated components. Withthis in mind, we note that Quigley speaks of seven stages in the evolution ofany civilization: > 1) Mixture> 2) Gestation> 3) Expansion> 4) Age of Conflict> 5) Universal Empire> 6) Decay> 7) Invasion28We may, for our purposes, overlay two distinct “periods” in the evolution of thebreakaway civilization over Quigley’s stages to clarify the history that willemerge in this book:> 1) Mixture: The conditions of the breakaway civilization’s rise in Nazi> Germany are created by a mixture of components of the host civilization, i.e.,> Western civilization in general, and the unique ideology of Nazism;> 2) Gestation: The elements of the breakaway civilization begin to emerge in> the Third Reich with the creation of parallel and nested bureaucracies> precisely concerned with> a) the invention of new technologies in secret; and> b) the means of the accumulation of surplus to sustain their development and> utilization;> 3) Expansion: At this stage, the breakaway civilization becomes a “state> within a state”, and is of exclusive Nazi character as the Reich itself> expands;> 4) Age of Conflict: During this and the next stage, the breakaway civilization> takes on new independence from the Nazi state, while remaining reliant upon it> as its host;> 5) Universal Empire> 6) Decay: as the war will clearly be lost by the host, i.e., by the Third> Reich, the breakaway civilization, which by now has transformed its> instruments into institutions connected with the Third Reich, undergoes a> process of self-reformation, transforming those institutions back into> instruments for the express purpose of surviving the war and continuing its> existence under changed circumstances;> 7) Invasion: When the war ends, the breakaway civilization transplants itself> into new hosts and redefines itself accordingly, regaining contact with the> factions that originally helped create the conditions for its rise in the> first place.It is worth noting that Quigley states that during the fourth stage, the age ofconflict, a growth of irrational belief systems and behaviors arises as a signof that stage.29 In this case, however, the irrationality is Fascism itself, andthis ideological component becomes a stable feature of the breakawaycivilization in all its stages, as we shall discover.There is one final crucial element of civilizations in Quigley’s thought, and itwill become a core component of our analysis here. For Quigley, in everycivilization, from Mesopotamian to modern Western civilizations, there are“core” and “peripheral” societies or states. We may illustrate what he means bypointing out that, in his analysis, the “core” societies or states of Westerncivilization emerged in France and England(and subsequently the United States),while peripheral states were societies or nations such as Germany.Thus, “core” and “peripheral” states or societies are denoted by theirgeographical proximity to each other, by their location and physical conditionsof existence. But in the case of a “breakaway” civilization, we are not solucky, for in the first instance, we are dealing with a society that isparasitic, i.e., living off a host, and in the second instance, its location, byits very nature, exists in several centers, many of these secret, or at leastinaccessible to the general public of its host. How then does one define its“core” and “peripheral” areas? The answer, in the coming pages, is surprising,and disconcerting.C. Conclusions and Implications We are now in a position to summarize what we are looking for. By the nature ofthe case, we are looking for> 1) A civilization existing within a host civilization,> 2) With means of surplus accumulation that are a mixture of known and more> covert sources, for the express purpose of,> 3) the invention of advanced technologies which it intends to utilize in some> fashion as yet to be ascertained,> 4) with an ideology or world view of an almost quasi-religious character, an> ideology in turn intimately coupled with the advanced technologies at its> disposal, and with a basic Fascist world view of the mixture of corporations> and governments; and,> 5) a “core” and “peripheral” locations; and finally,> 6) since much of this technology is of a military nature or of obvious> military application, we may also look for the full panoply of military> operations in connection with it, i.e., reconnaissance, psychological warfare,> and so on.Our entry into the exploration and analysis of the history of the breakawaycivilization will be via the last of these components, for as already noted,there is an intimate and deep relationship between the military technologies ofa civilization, and the world view that those technologies engender. We willenter the hall of mirrors of the breakaway civilization via its psychologicaloperations performed in conjunction with those technologies, and via thesuggestions of their first manifestation in the most famous—or, depending onone’s lights—infamous of all UFO contactees.George Adamski. 1 Cited in my book LBJ and the Conspiracy to Kill Kennedy: A Coalescence ofInterests (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2011), p. 277.2 Richard M.

The resemblance of aggregate social behaviorindividual humans and the statistical modeling of quantum mechanics is somethingQuigley points out. It is worth mentioning here that Quigley, with his closeassociation with and knowledge of international banking, also skirts close tothe connection between closed systems of finance and closed systems of scienceand physics. While this is not yet the place to explore this in more detail, itis worth noting what Quigley says in this respect with regard to the Greekrationalists, i.e., those in the broad Pythagorean, Platonic, Hermetictradition: “At that time the chief enemies of science were the rationalists.These men, with all the prestige of Pythagoras and Plato behind them, arguedthat the human senses are not dependable but are erroneous and misleading andthat, accordingly, the truth must be sought without using the senses andobservation, and by the use of reason and logic alone. The scientists of the daywere trying to reduce the complexity of innumerable observed qualities to thesimplicity of quantitative differences of a few fundamental elements.” (p. 41).Accordingly, Quigley ascribes the Aristotelian philosophical outlook to be thebroad basis behind modern science.This view, in fact, was challenged—and severely so—by scholars of his day, amongthem Frances Yates, who demonstrated that the broad Platonic-Neoplatonic, andHermetic tradition had far more to do with the rise of modern physics andmathematics in the hands Copernicus, Newton, and Leibniz, than most histories ofscience would care to admit. While this is not the place to explore therelationship between Aristotelianism and banking, it should be pointed out thatthe fundamental physics proposition of Platonism and Hermeticism is of opensystems, and that of Aristotelianism, closed systems. It is also worthmentioning that the bankers of Venice, who promoted Aristotelianism, manipulatedthe trial and execution of the 16th century’s premier Hermeticist, GiordanoBruno. In that, as they say, there lies a tale…17 Quigley, The Evolution of Civilizations, p. 132, emphasis in the original.18 Quigley, The Evolution of Civilizations, p. 137.19 Ibid, p. 138.20 Quigley, The Evolution of Civilizations, pp. 101–102.21 Ibid., pp. 102–103.22 Ibid., pp. 103.23 Ibid., pp. 116–117.24 Quigley, The Evolution of Civilizations, p. 76.25 Ibiid., p.99.26 Quigley, The Evolution of Civilizations, p. 424.27 Ibid., p. 100.28 Quigley, The Evolution of Civilizations, p. 146.29 Quigley, The Evolution of Civilizations, p. 152."},{"pageContent":"2THE ADAMSKI ANOMALIES:THE BEGINNINGS OF MURKY POSSIBILITIES “Adamski was a self-styled friend of the Venusians; he published two books withobviously faked photographs in support of his claims.”Jacques Vallee1 “Nearly all discussions of the UFO contactees start with George Adamski, themost accomplished of the lot.” Greg Bishop2By his own admission,3 George Adamski was just about the last person anyonewould expect extraterrestrials to make contact with, much less select as theirambassador to carry their “message” to humanity. Nor was this the only, nor thestrangest, anomaly about the man’s whole saga of alleged extraterrestrialcontact, for the Adamski story fits little of the modern-day stereotype ofextraterrestrial contact; there are no bug-eyed gray aliens, no reptilians, nogruesome kidnappings in the middle of the night with people being magicallyfloated from their beds by beams of light into saucers to be subjected to agruesome, bizarre, and downright sexual form of medical rape.Instead, Adamski’s “aliens” show up at the oddest times—like broad daylight4—andin the weirdest places—like restaurants and motel lobbies5—and they are entirelyhuman in appearance, one is tempted to say “Nordic” or even Teutonic,6 and theycommunicate both telepathically7 and by word of mouth.8 And that’s not all: theyinvite him aboard their distinctively “retro”-looking spaceships, there to havecordial discussions about theological matters9 (that could have been looked upin any standard encyclopedia of the day) around conference tables10 over whatmay best be described as a kind of informal high tea,11 at which Adamski istempted to smoke cigarettes, suggesting that in the high civilization of theextraterrestrial, anti-smoking fascism has not become the fad it is in themodern “free” West(perhaps they know something about tobacco our governmentisn’t telling us).12 To make matters very much worse, saidtelepathically-endowed humans travel in their decidedly retro-looking 1950sflying saucers and cigars, not so much from distant star systems, but from ourcelestial neighbors right here in our own solar system, such paradisial placesas Venus,13 Mars,14 and Saturn,15 all parts of a great Roddenberry-esqueplanetary Federation16 enjoying the fruits of harmony, advanced technology, andenlightenment as they “boldly go where no man has gone before”.So nutty is all this nonsense—from any number of perspectives, not the least ofwhich is planetary geology17—that few even in the UFOlogy community, suffused asit is by much more serious and plausible stories of middle-of-the-nightkidnapping and medical examinations by reptiles and little gray bug-eyed robots,take Adamski seriously at all anymore.image [images/00006.jpg] George AdamskiWorse still (yes, it does get worse!), Adamski bolstered all these fantastictales by claiming that the military recruited him to photograph the saucers(which, we learn later, were from Venus, at least, in their initial contacts).This is where the devil, as they say, is in the details.A. Contact with Whom? Adamski wrote two books recounting his alleged contact with extraterrestrials:Flying Saucers Have Landed, a prosaic account of his initial contact, and Insidethe Spaceships, a wild Chopinesque fantasia about his subsequent visits to a“mothership” parked in Earth orbit. Though most now discount these wildfantasias, a closer look at them reveals many of the “memes” that have become aconstant in the lore and mythology of contemporary UFOlogy, so a closer reviewis in order, for in that examination, as we shall see, are the beginnings ofmurky possibilities.He begins his Flying Saucers Have Landed with the self-observation that he is a“philosopher, student, teacher,” and “saucer researcher.”18 From there, hequickly moves to inform the reader that he owns two telescopes, a 15” reflector,and a more portable 6” reflector for which a camera is adapted to fit over theeyepiece.19From here, the story moves quickly to a radio report of a cigar-shaped UFO overSan Diego in 1946, a sighting discussed weeks later in Adamski’s cafe on aSunday: > During this discussion six military officers who were sitting at another table> listened intently to all points brought up. Then one of them spoke up and> said, ‘It is not as fantastic as it sounds. We know something about this.’ I> immediately asked what knowledge they had, but they would not reveal it. Yet> they assured us all that the ship we had seen and were discussing was not of> this world.20Before pausing to analyze this encounter and what it might portend, it is worthnoting that Adamski claims that he and members of his household had also seen asimilar UFO at the time in question, and that Adamski described it as “a largeblack object, similar in shape to a dirigible, and apparently motionless.”21 Theobject appeared after an intense rain shower. Initially, we are told, Adamskithought nothing of it, but rather wrote it off to some sort of advanced thoughclassified human technology: “I figured that during the war some new types ofaircraft had been developed and that this was one of them.”22 As Adamski and hishousehold were watching this strange “dirigible,” the craft “pointed its noseupward and quickly shot up into space, leaving a fiery trail behind it whichremained visible for a good five minutes.”23Taking Adamski at his word here—and we shall see later that there are abundantreasons to question his assertions—then what we have is an unusual constellationof relationships: > 1) Adamski sees a dirigible-shaped aircraft or UFO of some sort which leaves a> contrail as it zips out of sight. As we have noted elsewhere, this signature> was specifically mentioned in two US Air Force intelligence documents in the> wake of the Roswell incident.24 Adamski himself drew the logical conclusion> that this, far from representing some sort of extra-terrestrial technology,> represented some terrestrial one. Indeed, dirigibles do have the ability to> seem to “hover,” though they do not zip away leaving contrails. At best then,> there is nothing about the sighting whose technological details compel to the> conclusion that the origins of the craft were extraterrestrial;> 2) The San Diego sighting of a similar craft was subsequently being discussed> in Adamski’s cafe, with “six military officers” in attendance. It is from> these officers that Adamski learns the “fact” that the technology seen in San> Diego—and by implication the one he had seen—was extraterrestrial, though the> officers offer no substantiation for this assertion;> 3) Thus, if one accepts Adamski at his word, then the “meme” of an> extraterrestrial origin of this strange technology did not originate from> Adamski himself, but from the U.S. military.The significance of this “fact” cannot be pondered too long, for as I point outin Roswell and the Reich, a similar tactic of deflection of technologicaldetails to extraterrestrial origins for them might have been in play during theRoswell affair.25Let it also be carefully noted that Adamski’s first “contact” in connection withUFOs was not with “extraterrestrials”, but with the military. One gets thesense, here, that the military might indeed have been doing “damage control” inthe wake of the San Diego sighting, protecting an experimental technology with acover story of its extraterrestrial origins, much like it would later do withthe notorious Paul Bennewitz affair.26In any case, Adamski’s reaction to this revelation was somewhat predictable:“Naturally this made me take more stock in the situation,”27 he writes, and itis from this moment that he began to try to use his telescopes to photographUFOs. In other words, had the contact with the military not happened, he mightnever have pursued the course he subsequently did.As if to reinforce this interest, in 1949, Adamski was—again by his ownadmission—paid a visit: > Then late in 1949 four men came into the cafe at Palomar Gardens. Two of them> had been in before and we had talked a little about the flying saucers. This> day it was around noon, and raining—really pouring. They ordered some lunch> and we began talking about flying saucers again. One of these men was Mr J.P.> Maxfield, and another was his partner, Mr G.L. Bloom, both of the Point Loma> Navy Electronics Laboratory near San Diego. The other two men were from a> similar setup in Pasadena. One was in officer’s uniform.> They asked me if I would co-operate with them in trying to get photographs of> strange craft moving through space, since I had smaller instruments than those> at the big Observatory. I could maneuvre mine more easily than those on top> could be moved, especially my 6-incher, which was without a dome. I could> point it much as pointing a gun at ducks.> ….> I asked them then where I should look to be most likely to see the strange> objects which they were asking me to try to photograph. We discussed the pros> and cons of the possibility of bases being on the moon for inter-planetary> craft. And finally the moon was decided upon as a good spot for careful> observation.28One has difficulty believing the military would need an amateur astronomer andphotographer to assist it with spotting UFOs on the Moon with 6” and 15”telescopes, much less “discuss” where Adamski should be pointing his telescopesto photograph the elusive craft, unless it was trying to manipulate him. This initial contact was then followed by sightings of UFOs over MexicoCity—phenomena continuing to this day—which, according to Adamksi, were reportedon KMPC news of Beverly Hills. On this occasion, Mr. Bloom returned to Adamski’scafe and listened to the radio reports with Adamski. When the reporting wasfinished, Bloom informed Adamski that “they” did not have the “full story,”creating the distinct impression that Mr. Bloom—of the Navy electronicslaboratory in Point Loma—did.29 At this juncture, Adamski reports that he handedBloom a couple of UFO photographs he had taken through his telescope. Word ofthis somehow leaked to local media, and Adamski had to confirm that he hadturned over photographs to the US military, which in turn, of course, deniedthat they showed “spaceships.”30 Contacted about the Adamski photos, the US AirForce denied ever having received them.31Perhaps this was a bit of obfuscation, perhaps not, for Adamski had originallyturned his photos over to Mr. Bloom, and as far as Adamski knew, Bloom workednot for the Air Force, but for the US Navy. There are three possibilities here:either Adamski’s photos were simply lost in the inter-service rivalry andbureaucratic shuffle between the two services, or perhaps Adamski simply made upthe story about meeting the men in the first place, or perhaps Adamski was beingmanipulated to believe his own photos and role had a greater significance thanwas really the case. In other words, perhaps Adamski was a component andunwitting player in a psychological operation. As we proceed, the evidence forthe latter view will slowly accumulate.Indeed, Adamski himself obliquely suggests that the military’s role in hisphotographs may have been part of some secret agenda, for remarking on hispicture-taking, he then states that “I sent a set of them to the WrightPatterson Air Force Base. In the interest of national security they would havestopped me, if I was photographing our own secret craft. They never have.”32Perhaps they would have, perhaps they would not. Granting only for the sake ofargument that Adamski’s photos were genuine, the military could have easilymanaged the perceptions of what he was photographing by attributingextraterrestrial origins to them, and cloaking whatever technology might havebeen seen and photographed with a context that said “this is so far beyondterrestrial science that there is no need to investigate further.”But as is now readily granted in almost all ufological circles, the Adamskiphotographs were most likely simple hoaxes. In that case, the possibility arisesthat Adamski may have been helped in their concoction. But if so, then onceagain the question is, why?Part of the answer to this might be indicated by two curious statements thatAdamski makes in Flying Saucers Have Landed, statements that hover over itsotherwise goofy landscape with a sinister significance, a significance that inthe total context of his book is neither prepared nor resolved. There is nothingleading up to these statements, and there is nothing, really, leading away fromthem. They are just there.The first of these is a statement that will become a familiar “indirect”argument that because of the sheer numbers of UFO sightings—in the early 1950sremember—the possibility that they all originate from experimental militaryprojects cannot account for all of them.33 What is interesting here is not somuch the validity or the lack thereof of this line of reasoning, but the factthat it occurs almost for the first time in ufological literature in a book byone of ufology’s most notorious contactees. Adamski, in other words, was one ofthe first to formulate the argument that “their numbers and frequencies ofappearance took them out of (the) military experimental category.”34It is important to observe that this argument is an indirect one, for there arereally only three ways such a conclusion for the extraterrestrial origins forUFOs could ever be advanced with anything approaching certitude: > 1) The physics signatures of such objects must be exotic enough to compel to a> conclusion that they are beyond the capabilities of any known or conjectured> terrestrial science to embody;> 2) Actual UFOs might be recovered and the technology might be determined to be> so advanced as to be beyond human terrestrial science. In this eventuality, it> is likely that such recovered technology would be deeply classified, and as> such, any arguments for its off-world nature would depend on leaked> information or descriptions of debris;> 3) Actual UFO occupants might be recovered whose physiological features are so> odd or unusual that they compel to the conclusion of an extraterrestrial> origin.Such is, of course, exactly what has been alleged in many famous UFO cases. Weshall have occasion in this book to see that each of these three areas arethemselves not entirely compelling, and that each are wide open to themanagement of perceptions.The second statement that Adamski produced was even more unusual, and had evenless preparation in the context of the book than the previous one, and again,there is absolutely no follow-up anywhere else in the book, or in its sequel,Inside the Spaceships. Here, it is best to cite the statement in its context: > National security has many facets and the powers that be are themselves> pushing out in the direction of space and of antigravity. Also, they know they> have an enemy. And they do not know how far the enemy may have gone in this> general field of a new form of power and propulsion. They do know that at the> close of the war all the German scientists with knowledge did not come to this> country.35This is one of the most unusual statements in all of Adamski’s output, and it isan oft-overlooked one.Note that at this period of time, antigravity was being written about in theopen literature, however, the most popular articles would not be written until afew years after Adamski’s book was actually published - just as a spate ofpopular articles on the subject of anti-gravity appeared in the mid-1950s - withsome photographs that in turn appear to have been faked.36 Thus, Adamski appearsrather well-informed for a mere cafe owner who just happens to have been askedby people with military connections to photograph UFOs through his hometelescopes! And who faked them? Adamski? or the military?This only places the rest of his comments in an even more interesting light, forhow does Adamski know that the American military knows “they have an enemy”? Andwhat enemy is it? Adamski’s words here are curiously ambiguous. Is the enemy theSoviet Union? Is the enemy extra-terrestrials? Or someone else? And then, fromnowhere, unbidden, unprepared, and never followed-up, comes the statement thatnot all of the German scientists “with knowledge” came to this country, implyingthe “enemy” was the Nazis.In the context of a series of statements about anti-gravity, unknown enemies,and American uncertainties about how far “the enemy may have gone in thisgeneral field of a new form of power and propulsion,” it is a very soberingstatement to make in an otherwise goofy book. Adamski seems to be implying thatthe “enemy” were Nazis, for why mention Germans in connection with all thepreceding statements at all unless this was not his intention? As we shall see alittle later, there may be a very subtle clue in Adamski’s notorious photographsthemselves.1. The Nov 20, 1952 Contact: the Memes are Implanted Just as quickly as Adamski makes these statements, he leaves them for the morefamiliar ufological territory of the weird and exotic, in this case, his allegedcontact with an extraterrestrial. “It was,” writes Adamski, about 12:30 in thenoon hour on Thursday, 20 November 1952, that I first made personal contact witha man from another world. He came to Earth in his space craft, a flying saucer.He called it a Scout Ship.This took place on the California desert 10.2 miles from Desert Center towardParker, Arizona.37Accompanying Adamski on this “historical occasion” were his secretary, LucyMcGinnis, another woman who was the owner of a cafe in Palomar Gardens,38 andfour people from Arizona who agreed to meet Adamski at the “contact site.”The four from Arizona were Mr. and Mrs. A.C. Bailey, and “Doctor” and Mrs.George H. Williamson.39 We will return to George H. Williamson in a moment.According to Adamski, shortly after noon the group heard the sound of anaircraft, a two engine plane “on a routine flight.” Watching this airplane as itpassed directly over their heads, the group continued to watch it until it wasnothing but a speck.Then, “it” happened: > Suddenly and simultaneously we all turned as one, looking again toward the> closest mountain ridge where just a few minutes before the first plane had> crossed. Riding high, and without sound, there was a gigantic cigar-shaped> silvery ship, without wings or appendages of any kind. Slowly, almost as if it> was drifting, it came in our direction; then seemed to stop, hovering> motionless.> Excitedly Dr. Williamson exclaimed, ‘Is that a space ship?’> At first glance it looked like a fuselage of a very large ship with the sun’s> rays reflecting brightly from its unpainted sides at an altitude and angle> where wings might not be noticeable.> Schooled in caution against over-excitement and quick conclusions, especially> in regard to aircraft, Lucy replied, ‘No, George, I don’t believe it is.’> ‘But that baby’s high! And see how big it is!’ exclaimed Al.> ‘And Lucy! It doesn’t have wings or any other appendages like our planes do!’> persisted George. And turning to me, ‘What do you think Adamski?’> Before I could answer, Lucy interrupted, ‘You’re right, George! Look! It’s> orange on top—the whole length!’40And thus began the event that would transform George Adamski, cafe owner,amateur UFO photographer and erstwhile “consultant” to the military, intoAdamski the contactee.Certain that the intention of the craft’s occupants was to make contact, Adamskiordered his companions into the car in order to be driven closer to where hethought the “saucer” would land: > …(In) spite of all the excitement, I knew this was not the place; maybe not> even the ship with which contact was to be made, if that was in the plan. But> I did feel this ship had a definite ‘something’ to do with it all.> Fully aware of the curiosity created by our party here in the desert where no> one would normally picnic, I did not want to be more conspicuous by setting up> my telescope and camera in such an open spot. Above all else, I didn’t want to> make the slightest mistake that might prevent a landing and personal contact> being made, if such a possibility existed. And now I felt certain that it did.> I said, ‘Someone take me down the road—quick! That ship has come looking for> me and I don’t want to keep them waiting! Maybe the saucer is already up there> somewhere—afraid to come down here where too many people would see them.’> Don’t ask me why I said this or how I knew. I have already said that I have a> habit of following my feelings, and that is the way I felt.41As the group drove in the car to the spot that Adamski designated, they observedthe cigar-shaped object following them, stopping when the car stopped.42Adamski then proceeded by himself with his six inch telescope and camera to apoint a mile to a mile and a half from the car, ordering the rest of the groupto drive back and observe carefully.43 > Not more than five minutes had elapsed after the car had left me when my> attention was attracted by a flash in the sky and almost instantly a beautiful> small craft appeared to be drifting through a saddle between two of the> mountain peaks and settling silently into one of the coves about half a mile> from me. It did not lower itself entirely below the crest of the mountain.> Only the lower portion settled below the crest, while the upper, or dome> section, remained above the crest and in full sight of the rest of my party> who were back there watching. Yet it was in such a position that I could see> the entire ship as it hovered in the cove ahead of me. At the same time, many> miles of the highway and surrounding terrain were in full view of the crew> within the saucer.44Adamski quickly moved to snap a photograph of the saucer, “just as a couple moreof our planes roared overhead”45 and as the craft—now described as a“saucer”—flashed away and disappeared over “the same saddle through which it hadfirst come.”46While musing on this close “contact” and wishing that he had been able to makeactual personal contact with its occupant or occupants, Adamski’s wish isfulfilled: > Suddenly my reverie was broken as my attention was called to a man standing at> the entrance of a ravine between two low hills, about a quarter of a mile> away. He was motioning to me to come to him, and I wondered who he was and> where he had come from. I was sure he had not been there before. Nor had he> walked past me from the road.> ….> As I approached him a strange feeling came upon me and I became cautious. At> the same time I looked round to reassure myself that we were both in full> sight of my companions. Outwardly there was no reason for this feeling, for> the man looked like any other man, and I could see he was somewhat smaller> than I and considerably younger.47This man was, of course, Adamski’s “extraterrestrial.” Note that, thus far,there is nothing at all distinguishing this encounter from the ordinary otherthan Adamski’s “feeling.” Indeed, Adamski himself mentions the possibility thatthe man might even have been a prospector.48But before we continue with this encounter, the issue of one of Adamski’scompanions, who by Adamski’s own account is watching this whole transactionunfold a mile away, must be addressed.a. George Hunt Williamson and the Baileys George Hunt Williamson (1926-1986) and his wife, along with the Baileys, was oneof the group of four who met Adamski that day. But it is worth notingWilliamson’s background, and some of his connections. According to thebiographical note in Wikipedia, > Williamson, born in Chicago, Illinois… was mystically inclined as a teenager,> but transferred some of his occult enthusiasm to flying saucers in the late> 1940s. In early 1951 Williamson was expelled on academic grounds from the> University of Arizona. Having read William Dudley Pelley’s book Star Guests> (1950), Williamson worked for a while for Pelley’s cult organization, helping> to put out its monthly publication Valor. Pelley had generated huge quantities> of communications with “advanced intelligences” via automatic writing, and> very clearly was an immediate inspiration to Williamson, who combined his> fascination with the occult and with flying saucers by trying to contact> flying saucer crews with a home-made Ouija board. After hearing about the> flying-saucer-based religious cult of George Adamski, perhaps through Pelley,> Williamson and his wife, and fellow saucer believers Alfred and Betty Bailey,> became regular visitors to Adamski’s commune at Palomar Gardens and eventually> members of Adamski’s Theosophy-spinoff cult. They witnessed Adamski> “telepathically” channeling and tape-recording messages from the friendly> humanoid Space Brothers who inhabited every solar planet.49The article goes on to mention that Williamson was, along with the Baileys, the“witnesses” to Adamksi’s “contact,” (which the article mistakenly dates toNovember 18, 1952), but that in fact they experienced “nothing more than Adamskitelling them to wait and stay put while he walked over a hill, then came backinto view an hour later, with a preliminary story of his experiences—a storysubsequently greatly changed for book publication in Flying Saucers Have Landed(1953), as Williamson himself later pointed out.”50And what of Williamson’s contact with William Pelley? It is here that the plottakes a decidedly darker turn.b. William Pelley and the American Fascists William Dudley Pelley (1890-1965) claimed to have undergone a near-deathexperience in 1928, during which he met with God and Christ, who “instructed himto undertake the spiritual transformation of America.”51 Once the GreatDepression hit America a year later, Pelley’s “spiritual transformation” ofAmerica began in earnest when he became politically active. By the time AdolfHitler had come to power in January 1933 in Germany, “Pelley, an admirer ofHitler, was inspired to form a political movement and on that same day foundedthe Silver Legion, an extremist and anti-semitic organization whose followers(known as the Silver Shirts and ‘Christian Patriots’) wore Nazi-like silveruniforms.”52 Having founded branches of the Silver Legion “in almost every statein the country” Pelley soon had a sizeable following.53By 1940, Pelley’s organization and its hatred for President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt had earned the ire of the Roosevelt Administration, and in 1940 hisNorth Carolina headquarters in Asheville was shut down by Federal marshals. Hisfollowers at the headquarters were arrested and Pelley’s property was seized.Pelley himself was summoned to testify before the House Un-American ActivitiesCommittee.54Things went from bad to worse. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Pelleywas forced to disband his Fascist organization, but Pelley himself continued toattack the administration until he was finally charged with sedition and hightreason in April 1942. While the sedition charge was dropped, Pelley was“convicted on other charges and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment,” beingparoled in 1952.552. The Messages from “E.T.” With Williamson’s occult and Pelley’s Fascist connections lurking in thebackground, let us now return to Adamski’s record of his “contacts.” Withrespect to this first contact—which Williamson subsequently admitted had beenelaborated for Adamski’s book—Adamski himself wrote: > 1. His trousers were not like mine. They were in style, much like ski trousers> and with a passing thought I wondered why he wore such out here in the desert.> 2. His hair was long, reaching to his shoulders, and was blowing in the wind> as was mine….> Although I did not understand the strange feeling that persisted, it was> however a friendly feeling toward the smiling young man standing there waiting> for me to reach him. And I continued walking toward him without the slightest> fear.> Suddenly, as though a veil was removed from my mind, the feeling of caution> left me so completely that I was no longer aware of my friends or whether they> were observing me as they had been told to do. By this time we were quite> close. He took four steps toward me, bringing us within arm’s length of each> other.> Now, for the first time I fully realised that I was in the presence of a man> from space—A HUMAN BEING FROM ANOTHER WORLD! I had not seen his ship as I was> walking toward him, nor did I look around for it now. I did not even think of> his ship, and I was so stunned by this sudden realisation that I was> speechless. My mind seemed to temporarily stop functioning.> The beauty of his form surpassed anything I had ever seen. And the> pleasantness of his face freed me of all thought of my personal self…56Adamski goes on to describe the man as being approximately five feet six inchestall, and about 28 years old, with a round face, high forehead, and grey-greeneyes, with sandy hair and a skin color like a “medium-coloured suntan”.57As the men approached, the man extended his hand, as if to shake hands, andAdamski “responded in our customary manner.”58 But this was rejected “with asmile and a slight shake of his head. Instead of grasping hands as we on Earthdo, he placed the palm of his hand against the palm of my hand, just touching itbut not too firmly.”59 Later, in his subsequent contacts with the“extraterrestrials,” Adamski elaborated on this “secret handshake”: > I jumped to my feet with what probably could be described only as a broad> grin. Firkon (the extraterrestrial with whom Adamski is conversing, ed) too> wore a wide smile, and we exchanged the customary greeting. Then he said a> certain word, stressing it in a way which clearly gave to it some particular> significance.As we left the hotel together…\\(That’s right; they’re in a hotel!) > …he said, ‘The handclasp has been described to a certain extent and we thought> it best to add the word you have just heard as a further identification> between you and those of our worlds who are contacting you here. This will be> particularly useful in case you are approached by someone strange to you, as> will sometimes be the case.60In other words, the Space Brothers are quite literally members of a celestialLodge, exchanging crypto-Masonic greetings with their erstwhile earthman contactby means of a secret handshake and typically Masonic exchanges of code words!But let us return to the initial contact. The “secret handshake” thus exchanged,the two men got down to business. “I am a firm believer,” Adamski says, as he isdetailing the first communications between himself and the extraterrestrialsubject of his first contact, > that people who desire to convey messages to one another can do so, even> though they neither speak nor understand the other’s language. This can be> done through feelings, signs, and above all, by means of telepathy.(Remote viewers, eat your hearts out!) > I had been teaching this as fact for 30 years and now I concluded I would have> to use this method if information of any kind was to pass between us. And> there were a lot of things I wanted to know, if only I could think of them.> So, to convey the meaning of my first question to him, I began forming, to the> best of my ability, a picture of a planet in my mind. At the same time I> pointed to the sun, high in the sky.> He understood this, and his expression so indicated.> Then I circled the sun with my finger, indicating the orbit of the planet> closest to the sun, and said, ‘Mercury’. I circled it again for the second> orbit, and said, ‘Venus’. The third circle I said, ‘Earth,’ and indicated the> earth upon which we were standing.> I repeated this procedure a second time, all the while keeping as clear a> picture of a planet in my mind as I was able to perceive, and this time> pointing to myself as belonging to the Earth. Then I indicated him, with a> question in my eyes and mind.> Now he understood perfectly, and smiling broadly he point to the sun; made one> orbit, made the second, then touching himself with his left hand, he gestured> several times with his right index finger toward the second orbit.> I took this to mean that the second planet was his home, so I asked, ‘You mean> you came from Venus?’ This was the third time I had spoken the word ‘Venus’ in> relation to the second planet, and he nodded his head in the affirmative.> Then, he, too, spoke the word ‘Venus’.61A Venusian had come to the much cooler climate of the California desert to talkpersonally to George Adamski!a. The Venusian and “The Bomb” From these simple beginnings, Adamski and his Venusian visitor moved quickly toa discussion of interplanetary politics and the “bomb,” the first of many“messages” given to Adamski, and the first of many “memes” implanted within theUFO community: > He made me understand that their coming was friendly. Also, as he gestured,> that they were concerned with radiations going out from the Earth.> This I got clearly since there was a considerable amount of radiation of heat> waves rising from the desert, as if often the case. Such as the waves that are> often seen rising from pavements, and highways on hot days.> He pointed to them and then gestured through space.> I asked if this concern was due to the explosions of our bombs with their> resultant vast radio-active clouds?> He understood this readily and nodded his head in the affirmative.> ….> I wanted to know if this was affecting outer space?> Again a nod of affirmation.62To my knowledge, this is one of the first times in UFO literature that the ideaof atomic testing as a cause for “extraterrestrial reconnoitering” was putforward, being subsequently picked up by Frank Edwards, and later by StantonFriedman. In Adamski’s case, however, the idea has gone far beyondextraterrestrial “reconnaissance,” and was now supplemented by a politicalmessage that humanity was on a course of ignorance and error.63 b. Adamski’s E.T.s, and Religion: The Interplanetary Federation of Brotherhoodand the “Übermensch ET”Having established the concerns of the inhabitants of the planet Venus overterrestrial nuclear testing, Adamski then managed to ask the Venusian if hebelieved in God. Receiving an affirmative answer, Adamski quickly amended this: > But he made me understand, by elaborating a little longer with his gestures> and mental pictures, that we on Earth really know very little about this> Creator. In other words, our understanding is shallow. Theirs is much broader,> and they adhere to the Laws of the Creator instead of laws of materialism as> Earth men do.64Note what we have here: if, on the one hand, one is inclined to take Adamski athis word, and in spite of the abundant evidence not to do so, then whoever it ishe is having contact with is subtly conveying the notion that extraterrestrialsare not only technologically, but morally and spiritually superior to humanbeings. And if one does not take Adamski at his word, but rather admits that thewhole contact scenario is one gigantic fantasy, then the end result is still thesame, only in this case it is Adamski who is promulgating the idea of thetechnological and moral superiority of extraterrestrials.This idea or meme of the “Übermensch ET” is found again in the series of allegedcontacts elaborated in Adamski’s Inside the Spaceships, where Adamski attributesalmost angelic and supernatural powers to his “Space Brothers” when he confesseshis “deep conviction that these men could answer all questions and solve allproblems concerning our world: even to performing feats impossible to Earth menif they deemed such necessary and in keeping with the mission they had come toperform.”65The message being implied by the sum total of Adamski’s writing thus far is bothsubtle and disturbing, for what he is really doing is remaking and refashioningconventional religion, with its angels and messianic expectations and even its“apostolic mission” that the ETs “had come to perform”, into a revelation ofsuperior beings in possession of superior technologies with which they couldperform miracles, “feats impossible to Earth men”. Even the appearance ofAdamski’s “extraterrestrials” as human beings is all too reminiscent of theappearances of “angels” at various stages of the “disclosure” of the biblicalrevelations to Abraham, to Moses, and eventually, to the Virgin Mary. Just as inthe biblical pattern, Adamski’s “angels” or “messengers” appear as humans,bearing a message.66Adamski, in other words, and despite the disregard and even bemused disdain inwhich he is held by contemporary ufology, is nonetheless implanting all thereligious memes into ufology that will later become such subtle and dogmaticfoundations in the extraterrestrial faith.Thus, his initial and subsequent contacts even disclose the attempt to“catholicize” this extraterrestrial faith, for Adamski’s Venusian “made meunderstand that people are coming Earthward from other planets in our system,and from planets of other systems beyond ours.”67 Among the specific planetsthat Adamski mentions as “parishes” in this extraterrestrial catholic religion,besides Venus, are Mars and Saturn.68Earlier we noted the quasi-Masonic nature of the actual “contacts” themselves,with the exchanges of “secret handshakes” and coded words. But the resemblanceis more than superficial, for in Inside the Spaceships, one of Adamski’sextraterrestrial contacts delivers yet another short sermonette containingthemes near and dear the teachings of fraternal secret societies: universalbrotherhood and reincarnation: > Never cease to point out to them, my son, that all are brothers and sisters> regardless of where they have been born, or have chosen to live. Nationality> or the colour of one’s skin are but incidental since the body is no more than> a temporary dwelling. These change in the eternity of time. In the infinite> progress of all life, each eventually will know all states.69This message of brotherhood and fraternity in the context of reincarnation iscoupled elsewhere with another message, one with subtle undertones of its own.“Your school system on Earth,” another extraterrestrial tells Adamski, > is, in a sense, patterned after the universal progress of life. For in your> schools you progress from grade to grade, and from school to school, toward a> higher and fuller education. In the same war, man progresses from planet to> planet, and from system to system towards an ever higher understanding and> evolvement in universal growth and service.70Note the extraordinary subtlety with which the idea of degrees of initiationinto higher consciousness states —itself a theme of the secret societies - isoutlined in this brief passage, and coupled to a very ancient religious idea,that of reincarnation coupled with an association to celestial bodies. But thereis a darker undercurrent here, and that is the idea of “universal growth andservice,” which could equally be restated as “perpetual reincarnation andservitude.” In other words, behind the seemingly friendly and fraternal messagesof Adamski’s visitors lies a much more occult agenda, an agenda hinted at,perhaps, by his associate George Hunt Williamson’s connection to William Pelley.Elsewhere, all these religious memes are given yet another twist, this time by a“Martian” who informs Adamski that: > We live and work here…We have lived on your planet now for several years. At> first we did have a slight accent. But that has been overcome and, as you can> see, we are unrecognized as other than Earth men.> At our work and in our leisure time we mingle with people here on Earth, never> betraying the secret that we are inhabitants of other worlds. That would be> dangerous, as you well know. We understand you people better than most of you> know yourselves and can plainly see the reasons for many of the unhappy> conditions that surround you.71As has been seen, Adamski ascribes almost angelic and supernatural capabilitiesto his extraterrestrials, by dint both of their extraordinary technology as wellas by dint of their moral and spiritual superiority. Now, he has added a newdimension, namely, that they constitute a hidden elite, a kind ofextraterrestrial priesthood, living and moving among us and, presumably,spreading their messages and thus manipulating - socially engineering -mankind.This twist, coupled with the meme of “universal growth and service,” subtlysuggests that mankind is meant to serve these extraterrestrial overlords.c. The Revelation of the “Revelation”, or “Disclosure”, Meme One of the most peculiar, and intriguing, things that Adamski mentions as acomponent of his initial contact with the Venusian is the idea of “therevelation of the possibility of revelation”: > Remembering a question that had often been asked of me by people with whom I> had talked, I asked why they never land in populated places?> To this he made me understand that there would be a tremendous amount of fear> on the part of the people, and probably the visitors would be torn to pieces> by the Earth people, if such public landings were attempted.> I understood how right he was, and within my mind wondered if there ever would> be a time when such a landing would be safe. I was wondering too, if such a> time ever arrived, would they then attempt public landings.> He read my thoughts as they were passing through my mind, and assured me that> such a time would arrive. And when it did, they would make landings in> populated territories. But he made me understand clearly that it would not be> soon.72Again, to my knowledge, this is one of the first times, if not the first time,that the idea of a future “disclosure” or “revelation” of the extraterrestrialpresence is broached in UFO literature. It requires little imagination to seehow widespread, and diversified, this “meme” has become within ufology in recentyears, for it now encompasses not only the original idea of disclosure by theETs themselves (acting in the place traditionally taken by God in conventionalreligion), but also disclosure by the various governments (taking the place ofthe teaching magisterium in conventional religions) presumably suppressing theirpresence, to disclosure of the hidden technologies presumably gained fromextraterrestrial contacts.d. The End of the Contact Toward the end of his initial contact, Adamski’s Venusian finally speaks in hisnative tongue (we can only presume that it is Old High Venusian), which, toAdamski, “sounded like a mixture of Chinese with a tongue that I felt could havesounded like one of the ancient languages spoken here on Earth.”73 With this, wehave yet another meme that is being very carefully, and discretely, introducedfor one of the first times, that of the connection of extraterrestrials (ofhuman form) to human antiquity itself. Again, to my knowledge, Adamski was oneof the first people writing in ufology to make this connection.743. The Memes of Adamski’s Extraterrestrial Faith Summarized At this juncture it is worth pausing to take stock of all the memes that havebeen enunciated by Adamski (or by his visitors, depending on one’s point ofview), and that will play such significant roles in subsequent ufology and inthe wider cultural perception of the subject of UFOs. We may catalog these memesas follows: > 1) Extraterrestrials are concerned with the human development of nuclear> weapons, and view it as a threat to humanity and as an implied threat to> themselves, and have thus been visiting Earth and even working among humans to> reconnoiter the situation;> 2) Extraterrestrials are a technologically and morally superior race of> mankind (or in later ufology, an altogether different species);> 3) The extraterrestrial meme is coupled with those of universal brotherhood,> reincarnation, and planetary initiations;> 4) Within this extraterrestrial Adamskian faith, all the patterns of> conventional religion are stripped of their traditional religious vestments> and updated with new technological and extraterrestrial trappings; old> concepts have been dressed up in a new context;> 5) Extraterrestrials—with all their superhuman technology and> morality—constitute a hidden elite living and working amongst humanity (thus> discretely inculcating a culture of suspicion);> 6) Extraterrestrials constitute a “catholic” interplanetary federation, a kind> of interplanetary Masonic “brotherhood” in which one’s role is to be involved> in “universal growth and service,” a message implying servitude to the> technologically and morally superior extraterrestrials, who, let it be noted,> can be identified solely by their possession of superior technology, a> technology which they use to emphasize their superior morality and to subtly> imply mankind’s subservience;> 7) Finally, it is revealed that eventually there will be a revelation, i.e.,> the meme of “disclosure” is discretely planted in and through the Adamski> material.When the Adamski “catalog of ufological memes” is viewed in this way, it isclear that while contemporary ufology has long ago foresworn any connection toor credence in Adamski’s wild mythologies, it nonetheless remains true that themajor themes of his mythology, many of which he enunciated for nearly the firsttime within ufology, have remained to take deep roots, and to spread widebranches, not only within the field of ufology, but within the wider cultureperception of UFOs that it influences.For these reasons alone, Adamski may not be so glibly dismissed as anembarassment to the subject. But there are also other reasons that he may not beso casually dismissed.4. Adzamski’s Technological Descriptions and Another E.T. Message: The Danger ofWeaponized Gravity Adamski is, of course, best known for his wild tales of extraterrestrial contactand visitation, but what many people do not realize is that Adamski also gavesome descriptions of the technology of his alleged extraterrestrials. Here theplot, once again, is about to take yet another very unexpected turn, for duringhis first contact with the “Venusian,” Adamski asked him how his ship operatedand by what power it obtained its energy. When reading Adamski’s description inthe following exchange, bear in mind that the entire contact itself is deeplyand seriously disputed by almost all respected voices within ufology: > He made me understand that it was being operated by the law of attraction and> repulsion, by picking up a little pebble or rock and dropping it; then picking> it up again and then showing motion.> I in turn, to make sure I understood, picked up two pebbles and placed them> close to each other as though one was magnetic, pulling on the other,> illustrating it that way as I spoke the word ‘magnetic’. After a short time of> doing this, he answered me; even repeating the word ‘magnetic’ which I had> already spoken a number of times.> Then he replied, ‘yes’.75Being finally allowed near to the saucer as it began to depart, Adamski “noticedtwo rings under the flange around the centre disk. This inner ring and the outerone appeared to be revolving clockwise, while the ring between these two movedin a counter clockwise motion.”76 This, by now, should ring a bell—punintended77—for as I detail elsewhere in my books, the principle ofcounter-rotation was a primary conceptual component of the Nazi Bell project,though in the latter case the counter-rotating elements were not nested oneinside the other, but were stacked one on top of the other.78The important point to notice here, whether or not Adamski’s whole contactscenario actually occurred, or whether he made up the whole thing, or whetherthe truth lies somewhere between the two, is that Adamski somehow managed to hitupon the concept of rotation and counterrotation as being central to theconfiguration of anti-gravity propulsion systems, points that would not beraised in the scientific literature until some three decades later.79 This isnot the only case where Adamski displays an unusual and highly anachronisticknowledge, as we shall see shortly.However, to return for the moment to Adamski’s descriptions of the technologieshe allegedly saw, it was during his encounters recounted in Inside theSpaceships that he details more aspects of the “technology of the saucers”. Onceinside one of the ships, Adamski > …was aware of a very slight hum that seemed to come equally from beneath the> floor and from a heavy coil that appeared to be built into the top of the> circular wall. The moment the hum started, this coil began to glow bright red> but emitted no heat.80Note that the description of the technology here is anything but unusual, sincehe is describing a wholly conventional, terrestrial coil.Nor was this all. Shortly after this coil began to glow, Adamski describeshearing a sound like “the soft hum as of a swarm of bees.”81 Again, this is avery curious statement, since one of the nicknames the Germans had for theirBell project was der Bienenstock, the Beehive, so nicknamed because of thebuzzing sound it made, like a swarm of bees!82 Yet, the Bell story would notemerge until decades later, in the 1990s, after the collapse of Communism andthe German reunification.A pole two feet in diameter ran from the top of the ship through the center ofthe floor, which Adamski was told was the “magnetic pole” of the craft. He wasalso told that the poles could be reversed.83 This “rod of power” was anchoredat each end by two structures that resembled “great lenses.” 84 Here too one isconfronted with an odd resemblance to the Nazi Bell device, which had on itscentral axis a pole, which could function as one pole of an electrical circuit,while the outer counter-rotating components acted as the other.85 Elsewhere, a“Martian” tells Adamski that the “magnetic” power of all this technology acts inconcert with the Earth’s natural magnetic field.86Putting all this together, Adamski’s “space brothers” are describing the actionof rotating fields within static ones, a description that sounds suspiciouslylike another celebrated but wholly terrestrial and conventional technology inthe lore of “strange technology”: the Philadelphia Experiment.87Finally, to round out all these extraterrestrial explanations, one of Adamski’slater visitors informs him that the “Space Brothers” would gladly reveal thesecrets of gravity control, but that they do not do so for fear that humans willweaponize it and go on a mad spree of interplanetary conquest!88What emerges from this is not so much the bizarre nature of the technologydescribed, but the fact that Adamski is describing it in a detail that has somany parallels with later actual formal papers and investigations,89 and withthe basic conceptual principles involved in a secret Nazi project that wouldonly come to light four decades later, after German reunification. What isunusual therefore is the highly anachronistic nature of Adamski’s descriptions,coupled with his earlier allusions to the Nazi “enemy”.How would one therefore account for this extraordinary accuracy in the midst ofan otherwise goofy fantasy involving extraterrestrial contact, a fantasy thatfew—this author included—take at face value or as genuine?5. A Doozie of an Anachronistic Revelation Before one can begin to answer that question, there is a final anachronism thatAdamski’s Inside the Spaceships contains, and it’s a doozie. While on his outingto the enormous mothership in orbit above the Earth, Adamski noticed a pictureof an even larger ship, several miles long. He is told that “many such shipshave been built,” specifically, on Mars and Saturn!90What makes this so anachronistic is that the NASA Cassini probe—fifty years inthe future from Adamski’s bizarre statements!—would send back pictures ofSaturn’s moon Iapetus in the 21st century, pictures that strongly suggested theentire moon was an artificial object.91 Additionally, recent European SpaceAgency photos of Mars’ moon Phobos has suggested to Richard Hoagland that thismoon, too, might be an artificial object, and Soviet scientists proposed thesame idea before Hoagland.92If this is merely a coincidence, then it is the latest, and largest, in a longline of “coincidences” that Adamski racked up. How would one account for this?Clearly, Adamski is getting information from somewhere, and since it is veryunlikely that his contact stories are anything else other than fantasy, thenwhere is the information coming from?We have already seen his second-hand connection to the American Fascist WilliamPelley via George Hunt Williamson, suggesting that in part he may have beengetting information directly from that quarter connected to esoteric and occulttradition. We have also seen Adamski’s own suspicious connections to theAmerican military, a connection initiated not by Adamski, but by the military.But why would the military share any such technological information, much lessinformation about gigantic artificial spaceships from Saturn and Mars? Onereason, perhaps, is to render such information ridiculous by embedding it in acontext of contact lunacy, and doing so while implanting memes to manipulate theperception of that technology.If, in other words, Adamski is part of some wider covert psychologicaloperation, then whose operation is it, and what are its goals?The answer to that question might be revealed in the final “Adamski Anomaly”…B. Adamski’s Retro-Looking Saucers, and the Nazi Saucer Myth A picture is indeed worth a thousand words, but in this case, several picturesare worth millions of words. Adamski’s pictures of his alleged saucers are nowwell-known, if not infamous:image [images/00007.jpg] Adamski’s Decidedly Retro-Looking Flying Saucerimage [images/00008.jpg] Underview of Adamski’s Retro-Flying Saucerimage [images/00009.jpg] Adamski’s Cigar-Shaped Mother-ShipAs is now maintained in some quarters, Adamski apparently fabricated thesephotos by taking picture of a heater for a chicken coup!But the problem of Adamski’s “flying saucers” is further compounded with theappearance in the 1960s of an alleged SS document showing three purported Naziflying saucer designs called the Hannebu or Haunebu flying saucers, all ofwhich, especially the first two “marks”, looking distinctly like Adamski’ssaucer.image [images/00010.jpg] The Alleged SS Document, Showing the Purported Hannebu IIimage [images/00011.jpg] The Same Alleged SS Document Purporting to Show the Hannebu I Flying Saucerimage [images/00012.jpg] From the Same Alleged SS Document, Showing the Purported Hannebu III FlyingSaucerThe question is why would anyone circulate, several years after Adamski’s fakedphotographs, documents that not only depict curiously similar “saucer” designs,but also that have such a dubious provenance? There are no other supportingdocuments, only postwar stories.More importantly, how did the Nazis themselves react to these reports whenqueried? The answer is simple: “ET made us do it.”image [images/00013.jpg] One of the Alleged Photos of the Hannebu Saucer that Purports to be “Proof” oftheir existence. 1 Jacques Vallee.

Farrell, The Giza Death Star Destroyed, pp. 163-166; and ThePhilosophers’ Stone, pp. 99-101, 313-329. It should be pointed out that theGerman physicist Burkhardt Heim had begun to elabiorate his theory at about thesame time as Adamski was writing Flying Saucers Have Landed, in which rotationis an element. However, it is unlikely that Adamski knew of Heim or his theory.The question thus remains, where was Adamski getting his knowledge?In this Foreword to Inside the Space ships, Desmond Leslie, yet another famouscontactee, and notable occutist, of the 1950s maintained that some UFO witnesseswho had had close encounters with the technology, described a forcefiedemanating from them that would “flatten the grass” and set the witness “back onhis heels.” (Adamski, Inside the Spaceships, p. 87). Similar effects werereported by some of the first responders on the ground in New York City during9/11; moreover, as Dr. Paul LaViolette has demonstrated in his recent bookSecrets of Antigravity Propulsion: Tesla, UFOs, and Classified AerospaceTechnology (Bear & Co., 2008), microwaves were being explored as a means ofadvanced propulsion (q.v. pp. 195-200, 203, 206-209, 235, 284-285, 445). Some ofthese ideas were being discussed in the 1950s, more or less contemporaneouslywith Leslie’s witnesses who described such forcefields. Use of such intensemicrowaves might indeed be experienced as something pushing a witness away, butare more likely to be experienced as intense heat (if the person encounteringthem actually survived.)80 Adamski, Inside the Spaceships, p. 101.81 Ibid., p. 102.82 Farrell, The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, p. 177.83 Adamski, Inside the Spaceships, p. 102.84 Ibid., p. 167.85 Farrell, Secrets of the Unified Field, pp. 262-288.86 Adamski, Inside the Spaceships, pp. 107-108.87 Farrell, Secrets of the Unified Field. pp. 73, 165-190.88 Adamski, Inside the Spaceships, p. 140.89 We shall examine some of these papers an technologies subsequently.90 Adamski, op. cit., p. 121.91 Q.v.

MADE US DO IT”:THE POSTWAR STATEMENTS OF NAZIS “Call him a Nazi,He won’t even frown;‘Ha! Nazi schmazi!’Says Wernher Von Braun.”Tom Lehrer1There can be no doubt that within the thankfully short twelve years of itsproclaimed millennial existence that technology exploded in the Third Reich to adepth and breadth that was never seen before or since. As Nazi armies rolledover Europe expanding the boundaries of the Greater German Reich, Naziscientists and engineers were rolling back the frontiers of the technologicalimagination. Major accomplishments and breakthroughs were made in the field ofelectronics miniaturization, computers, semi-conductors, infrared night-vision,fuel-air explosives, jets, rockets, electromagnetic weapons, lasers andassociated technologies, atomic, thermonuclear, and plasma physics andengineering, ballistic missiles and field propulsion, and a whole host of otherthings that boggle the imagination.The most breathtaking visible displays of this scientific and engineeringprowess were those projects that took conventional technologies to the extreme:the ballistic missiles and rockets raining destruction down on London and otherwestern European cities, the advanced aerodynes, including designs which, thoughconceived and in some cases built in the 1930s and 1940s, look breathtakinglymodern to this day.How did one account for all this sudden and rapid explosion of technology? Evenmore importantly, how did the German scientists themselves account for it? Andwhat, if anything, does it have to do with the odd, anomalous anachronisms thatseem to turn up in Adamski’s writing at almost every turn?The answer to those questions brings us, inevitably, to the postwar statementsof the Nazis themselves, and in particular to…A. The Strange Case of Dr. Hermann Oberth:A Benign Biography If one were to consult only the bibliographies of Dr. Oberth publicly availableand and online, Wikipedia, for example, one would not have a full appreciationof the measure of the man, for those biographies are, for the most part, benign.One is even tempted to say, sanitized. We would learn, for example, the usualcommonplaces: he was born in 1894 at Nagszeben in the Austro-Hungarian empire,died at the age of 95 in December of 1989. Reading the science fiction of JulesVerne, he began to experiment with rockets when he was only 14; began to studymedicine in Munich but was drafted into the Kaiser’s army when World War Onebroke out; served on the Eastern front, married in 1918 and had four children.2In the 1920s, Oberth published two works on the use of rocketry in spaceexploration, Die Rakete zu den Planetenraumen (1922—By Rocket into PlanetarySpace), and an expanded version in 1929,Wege zum Raumschiffahrt (Ways toSpaceflight). Awarded his doctorate in physics in 1923 by the University ofCluj, Romania, Oberth also worked in Berlin during 1928 and 1929 as a consultantfor the first science fiction feature film, designing the moon rocket for Frauim Mond (The Woman in the Moon), the famous science fiction film director FritzLang’s futuristic vision set in space.3In 1929 Oberth also designed and test fired a rocket with the young Wenher VonBraun, thus beginning a lifelong friendship between the two men based on theirmutual designs and obsession with space exploration. Indeed, Von Braun’s ownpraise and indications of Oberth’s vast influence was effusive: > Hermannn Oberth was the first, who when thinking about the possibility of> spaceships grabbed a slide-rule and presented mathematically analyzed concepts> and designs… I, myself, owe to him not only the guiding star of my life, but> also my first contact with the theoretical and practical aspects of rocketry> and space travel. A place of honor should be reserved in the history of> science and technology for his ground-breaking contributions in the field of> astronautics.4By 1938 Oberth had moved his family from Romania to Austria and then to NaziGermany, eventually becoming a member of Von Braun’s secret rocket team atPeenemunde in 1941. In 1955 Oberth was personally sought and brought by hisformer friend in Nazi Germany, Wernher Von Braun, to Huntsville, Alabama, wherehe remained for three years, contributing to the study The Development of SpaceTechnology in the Next Ten Years, returning to West Germany in 1958, where “hepublished his ideas on a lunar exploration vehicle, a ‘lunar catapult,’ and on‘muffled’ helicopters and airplanes.”5 In 1960 he returned to work as aconsultant for the Convair Corporation which was engaged in producing theU.S.A.’s first strategic intercontinental ballistic missile, the Atlas, the verysame vehicle that would become the booster for America’s first manned spaceflights in Project Mercury.But as the Wikipedia article hints, there is more to Dr. Oberth than meets theeye: > The science-fiction movie Star Trek III: The Search for Spock mentions the> Oberth-class of starships hypothetically to be in his honor. Later on, this> same class of starships is mentioned in several episodes of the American TV> series Star Trek: the Next Generation.> Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa features Hermann Oberth> as the “teacher” of the movie’s protagonist, Edward Elric. Oberth is also> mentioned in the last episode of the TV series Fullmetal Alchemist. In this> episode, Elric has heard of a great scientist, named “Oberth”, with curious> theories.6Just how curious these theories really are we shall now see, for they are abizarre amalgam of extra-terrestrials, advanced technologies… and the occult.B. Dr. Oberth’s and Dr. Von Braun’s Statements on UFOs and Extraterrestrials By the mid-1950s, various American leaders had already gone on record with theirbelief that UFOs were the products of an advanced extraterrestrial technology.The well-known Ufologist Timothy Good, for example, mentions a famous statementby U.S. General of the Armies, Douglas MacArthur, who was involved in theestablishment of an early UFO study group called the Interplanetary PhenomenonUnit, a division of the U.S. Army’s counterintelligence. Speaking in 1955,General MacArthur made a rather astonishing statement: > The nations of the world will have to unite, for the next war will be an> interplanetary war. The nations of the earth must someday make a common front> against attack by people from other planets.7What is unusual here is that MacArthur’s public statement clearly contradictsthe findings of the CIA’s 1953 Robertson Panel on UFOs, which had concluded thatUFOs were not a national security threat.8> Four years later, after General MacArthur had made his celebrated> farewell—and—”oh-by-the-way-we’re-facing-an-interplanetary-war”—speech to the> cadets of West Point, U.S. Project Paperclip Nazi rocket scientist Wernher Von> Braun made yet another curious statement on January 1, 1959,9 alluding to some> sort of “difficulty”—if not outright conflict—in outer space after an American> Juno 2 rocket had been deflected from orbit:> We find ourselves faced by powers which are far stronger than we had hitherto> assumed, and whose base is at present unknown to us. More I cannot say at> present. We are now engaged in entering into closer contact with those powers,> and in six or nine months’ time it may be possible to speak with more> precision on the matter.10Notably Von Braun, like MacArthur, did not refer in so many words to“extraterrestrials” but simply to “powers which are far stronger than we hadhitherto assumed,” leaving open the possibility that he meant somethingconcerning physical forces. He alludes to an “unknown base” however, andindicates that “contact” is being attempted.Into this MacArthurian mix of “people”—the general’s word, not mine—attackingthe earth, and Von Braun’s “unknown base” and “powers far stronger than we hadhitherto assumed,” stepped Von Braun’s mentor, Dr. Hermann Oberth, with evenmore curious statements. Answering questions in 1968 about the UFO phenomenon,Dr. Oberth stated the following: > …today we cannot produce machines that fly as UFOs do. They are flying by> means of artificial fields of gravity. This would explain the sudden changes> of directions… This hypothesis would also explain the piling up of these disks> into a cylindrical or cigar-shaped mothership upon leaving the earth, because> in this fashion only one field of gravity would be required for all disks.> They produce high-tension electric charges in order to push the air out of> their path… and strong magnetic fields to influence the ionised air at higher> altitudes… This would explain their luminosity… Secondly, it would explain the> noiselessness of UFO flight. Finally, this assumption also explains the strong> electrical and magnetic effects sometimes, but not always, observed in the> vicinity of UFOs.11There are a number of disturbing things about these statements, if one readsthem closely, not the least of these is Dr. Oberth’s statements regarding usinghigh-tension (i.e., high voltage) electric charges to ionize the air anddecrease drag.This is significant because this very idea had already been proposed by Americanphysicist Thomas Townsend Brown in the mid-1950s in a patent utilizing“electro-gravitic” effects to decrease drag, improve fuel efficiency, andthereby the range, of conventional aircraft, and patented in 1960:image [images/00015.jpg] Thomas Townsend Brown, U.S. Patent # 2,949,550Note the diagram, Figure 8, in the lower right hand corner: image [images/00016.jpg] Close-up of Figure 8, Thomas Townsend Brown U.S. Patent 2,949,550Note on the left hand side of the disk-shaped capacitor, the leading edge ispositively-charged, with the trailing edge negatively charged, setting up acharge differential which accounts for the motivation of this “electro-kineticapparatus.” And note on the previous page that this is hooked up to a “H.V.Source,” a high voltage, or, in Dr. Oberth’s terms, a high tension source. Whilethe connection to Thomas Townsend Brown is fascinating, we must reserve commenton it to a later chapter, for as we shall discover, there is yet another oddconnection to AdamskiFor the moment, however, our attention remains focused on Dr. Oberth, for he isdescribing a wholly terrestrial technology in his UFO remarks, one alreadypatented in 1960, and this suggests in turn that the beginning of hisremarks—“…today we cannot produce machines that fly as UFOs do. They are flyingby means of artificial fields of gravity…”—he has seen the connection toanti-gravity. At the minimum, then, the possibility arises that Dr. Oberth wasbeing deliberately disingenuous in his remarks.But is there anything more direct that would conclusively demonstrate that hewas being disingenuous?There is another remark Dr. Oberth allegedly made shortly after his first periodin the USA that is reported by Ufologist Fred Steckling. Though I have not beenable to verify this quotation, it is worth mentioning here as it is consonantwith his later verified remarks concerning his belief that UFOs wereextraterrestrial in origin. According to Steckling, upon his retirement fromBell Laboratories, Dr Obert stated to the press, “Gentlemen, we cannot take allthe credit for our civilization’s rapid technological development over the pastdecade. We have had help.” When he was asked just who had helped us, Dr Oberthreportedly responded, “Those guys out there from the other planets.”12Steckling noted the anomaly apparent in these remarks: “This statement quicklyearned the good professor the honorable title of ‘crack-pot.’ However, thepeople responsible for his promotion never explained exactly how it is possiblefor a top scientist to turn crackpot overnight.”13 But perhaps Oberth was notbeing a “crack pot.”We have already noted his curious description of technologies first advanced bythe physicist Thomas Townsend Brown. Additionally, his former student, Dr.Wernher Von Braun, responsible for bringing Oberth to this country in the firstplace, was himself involved at some point in high level, and very classified,antigravity research, for as I pointed out in Secrets of the Unified Field, hewas very likely one of those who received a copy of the annotated Varo editionof Dr. Morris Jessup’s book on UFOs, the edition that outlined a connection tothe Philadelphia Experiment.14Before proceeding with a closer look at Dr. Oberth, it is also worth comparinghis, with Von Braun’s, remarks. In Von Braun’s case, it is worth noting thatthey are very carefully phrased. Nowhere does he allude to extraterrestrials,but simply to “powers” far “stronger” than “us,” and operating from some unknownbase. It is thus possible to construe his remarks as referring to some unknownhuman power, and to construe that power has possessing a secret base ofoperations either on, or off, this world. It is equally possible to construe VonBraun’s remarks is indicating an extraterrestrial power, again, with a secretbase of operations either on or off this world.But Dr. Oberth’s remarks contain no such ambiguity, for he clearly attributesUFO activity to extraterrestrials, albeit in a context that leads not toextraterrestrial technology but to terrestrial ones. Nonetheless, for anyonefollowing the story, and the connections between the two men dating back totheir work on Hitler’s rockets, the meaning was clear: Dr Oberth’s remarks werethe “context” in which Von Braun’s remarks were to be interpreted. In short, wemay be looking at a psychological warfare operation. That this is the probablecase is revealed when one recalls just exactly what projects Dr. Oberth wasassociated with in Nazi Germany.C. Dr. Oberth’s Background in Nazi Germany This context strongly suggests that Dr. Oberth, if not deliberately lying, wasat least misdirecting attention to extraterrestrials in the face of scientificprinciples that were already being investigated—quietly to be sure—in Americanaerospace projects. But there is another context in which his remarks must beviewed: his known involvement in occult belief, and his known connection to theNazi Bell project and its reported anti-gravity effects. This is where the storybegins to get very murky.Igor Witkowski observed that Dr. Oberth was somehow involved in two curiousactivities in Nazi Germany: the super-secret Bell project, and occultism: > In the files of the “Paperclip” project I also found the personal files of> several other interesting scientists, but there was no information of any> particular value. I began from Professor Hermann Oberth… Immediately after the> war a document was discovered in some buildings in Sroda Slaska, on which his> name appeared. It referred to a delegation of several scientists, who had> arrived from Prague, stopped on the way in Wroclaw/Breslau and Sroda> Slaska/Neumarkt (3 days) and then made their way to Torgau. The business trip> took place between 15.IX-25.IX.1944 and consisted of the following> individuals: Professor Hermann Oberth, Herbert Jensen, Dr. Edward Tholen, Dr.> Elizabeth Adler, and two others, whose names are illegible. The importance of> this information lies in the fact that Hermann Oberth was the most outstanding> specialist in the world engaged in space flight theory, with a far superior> authority than that of the young von Braun (at that time 32). In short he> represented a potential, which is undoubtedly not wasted, particularly when a> rocket programme was being put into effect, projecting several decades into> the future. …(This) information reveals to us a certain unusual and> significant fact—significant for the work being carried out.Namely that in> principle it is unknown what Prof. Oberth was engaged in during the war. One> could have the impression that this is some kind of light at the end of the> tunnel, which until now has been cloaked in the darkness of night. After all> it is known for sure that Oberth was not connected with the centre in> Peenemunde since in this case he would have undoubtedly held at least one of> the positions of command, in other words the fact of his engagement would have> been known (thousands of specialists employed there worked after the war in> other countries, from the USA and USSR to even Egypt and so is out of the> question that a possible secret of this kind could not be kept hidden). So it> seems that some kind of alternative program had existed, being carried out for> a long time, and quite a serious one at that. This is indicated even by (the)> fact alone of there being a lack of information on the wartime work of> Oberth…. A certain curiosity is represented by the fact that he was interested> in… occultism… It seems that the Americans were not interested in Oberth due> to his purely theoretical pre-war analyses, but for altogether more specific> reasons. It looks after all like it had been attempted to recreate the former> (Bell) research team—the information about Jensen probably came from Oberth,> since it was found in his personal file.15Notice now, what we have: > 1) Dr. Oberth was indeed connected to Von Braun in Nazi Germany;> 2) But Dr. Oberth’s connections to its wartime research are more directly tied> to the super-secret Bell project—a project with obvious antigravity> implications—than to the more “public” rocket program of Von Braun;> 3) Dr. Oberth also has an interest in the occult, a fact that may have had> something to do with the Bell project’s codenames reflecting, in part, an> occult influence.16What this quite plainly means, is that long before Oberth came to the U.S.A. andmade his “Extraterrestrial diagnosis” of the UFO phenomenon, he was clearlyinvolved in a very terrestrial project with explicit ant-gravity capability andpotentials.In other words, when Dr. Oberth was waxing lyrical about intelligences frombeyond the solar system, he was obfuscating at best, or lying at worst.If this is so, then this implies in turn that he was under some sort of ordersas part of a larger psychological operation.The question now becomes, why was he lying, and under whose orders was he doingso? Or to put it differently, when, where, how, and for what reasons, did theidea of coupling antigravity technology to psychological operations first begin?Thus far, all the evidence points to Nazi Germany, but we still need more solidproof.For that, we shall have to consider, in the next chapter, the actual Nazi flyingsaucer mythology, and some curious statements of Hitler’s favorite commando inchapter four.

As a result of this study, Oberthhad made a statement, during the summer of 1954, that UFOs were ’conceived anddirected by intelligent beings of a very high order. They probably do notoriginate in our solar system, perhaps not even in our galaxy.’ Like WilliamLear, Townsend Brown, and Wilbert Smith, Oberth decided that UFOs were’propelled by distorting the gravitational field, converting gravity intouseable energy.’“In a letter to Keyhoe, Oberth explained his electromagnetic propulsion theorywhich he believed as the true explanation for UFO propulsion. With the abilityto create their own gravitational fields, UFOs would be able to do all thethings witesses had attributed to them: hover motionless above the earth,accelerate at tremendous speed, and make violent turns that would cause ordinaryaircraft to disintegrate.” (Richard M.

Von Braun and Oberth were not beingentirely truthful with respect to their opinions that UFOs were extraterrestrialcraft, especially given Oberth’s status as a member of the Bell project.However, there is another suggestion—perhaps the strongest of them all—of apsychological operation at work with respect to the Nazis, and that is the NaziUFO mythos itself, and its incredible persistence notwithstanding a paucity of“evidence” in favor of it.This difficulty is compounded by the fact that, within that mythos, we aredealing with two very different claims, namely, that > 1] the Nazis developed circular, disk-shaped craft that were essentially> advanced forms of jet aircraft, with vectored exhausts; and,> 2] the Nazis developed advanced field propulsion saucers—the infamous Hannebu> and Vril craft, or the so-called Jehnseitsflugzeug,2—that far eclipsed Allied> and Soviet technology for decades to come. Within this component of the Nazi> mythos, no mention was ever made of anything remotely resembling the Nazi Bell> Project, which, as I have stated elsewhere, I believe to be the kernel or core> truth to this component of the mythos.3We are confronted by yet another difficulty as well, and that is the fact thatthere is an historical “gap” between the end of the Second World War in Europe,and the first appearance of the allegations of Nazi flying saucers in the early1950s. In this, as we shall argue in this chapter, there is a profound clue thatwe are dealing with a psychological operation designed both to obfuscate theactual core truth—the Bell project—and to confuse the enemy, the Soviet Union,with claims of advanced technology that fell into Allied hands. A. The Problematic of the Historical Gap1. The Basic Elements of the Mythosa. The Belluzo AllegationsResearcher Kevin McClure has been one of the foremost, and most capable,researchers to challenge the two components of the Nazi UFO mythos, in anexcellent online article entitled “The Nazi UFO Mythos: An Investigation.”4Indeed, for its concision and for the rich details it provides, it is also thebest introduction to the subject. McClure notes that > The earliest claim by an individual of the construction of a wartime flying> disk was made by Guiseppe Belluzzo on or around March 27 1950, at a time when> there had been a number of flying saucer reports in the Italian media, and> European interest in the subject was high. On that date the Italian newspaper> ‘Il Mattino dell’Italia Centrale’ published, with a vague and uninformative> line-drawing as illustration, Belluzzo’s apparent claim that circular aircraft> had been developed since 1942, first in Italy, and then in Germany. The> Italian idea was, supposedly, developed by the Germans in North-East Norway.> The story also appeared in ‘Il Corriere della Sera’, ‘La Nazione’, and ‘La> Gazzetta del Popolo’, and, in ‘Il Corriere d’Informazione’ of March 29-30> 1950, with a comment by a General Ranza of the Italian Air Force dismissing> Belluzzo’s claims. It seems that Belluzzo did not claim that the disc flew> during the war but that, by 1950, it had been sufficiently developed to> deliver an atom bomb. This development was said to be some 10 metres wide,> constructed with very light materials, and unmanned.> We know something of Belluzzo’s background and competence. Verga notes that he> lived from November 25 1876 to May 21 1952, and was a turbine expert who> published nearly fifty technical books. He was elected to the pre-war Fascist> parliament, and from 1925 to 1928 served as Minister of the National Economy.> I have traced a listing for a book of his - on turbines - full of technical> drawings and translated into English in 1926. It is quite feasible that he> could have contributed to a range of technological projects, but it seems that> he never claimed to have built a flying disc, nor to have named those who> worked with the Germans in Norway. As in all such reports, no viable> propulsion, launch, lift, flight, control or landing data is provided, and the> criteria for publication seems to have been that the object should resemble> the flying saucers which, as ever, had caught the media’s attention.> It is quite possible that a former Fascist minister would be happy to seek a> little belated glory for his nation and his regime, but for all of the later> interpretations of his role in the history of Nazi UFOs his claims were very> limited, and so far as the assertion of a design for a reasonably-sized,> unmanned flying disc was concerned, they are neither unique nor implausible.> Belluzzo may, in part at least, have been telling the truth.5Note the highlighted points, for they bear both on McClure’s skepticalassessment of the mythos, and upon our own critique of the skeptics, and ourhypothesis that the mythos may represent a psyop: > 1] The first claim for the development of a Nazi flying saucer is made in> 1950;> 2] The claim comes, not from an Nazi, neo-Nazi, or German source, but from a> former member of Mussolini’s Fascist government in Italy;> 3] Belluzo—whose name is altered in subsequent reports to Bellonzo—was indeed> a turbine expert, and thus, a logical candidate to be involved in the> development of jet powereed saucers;> 4] Belluzo provides no significant details regarding the technological aspects> of the alleged research, beyond providing enough information to satisfy even> skeptic McClure that the design “for a reasonably-sized, unmanned flying disc”> was “neither unique nor implausible,” and that thus “Belluzo may, in part at> least, have been telling the truth.”This last point is an astonishing admission, for the core of the Nazi saucermythos is that, in fact, the first prototypical developments were not of fieldpropulsion craft, but of suction turbine—jet—craft with vectored exhausts.b. The Schriever Allegations in Der Spiegel(The Mirror) Belluzo made his statements in Italy on March 27, 1950, and these statementswere followed a mere three days later, on March 30, 1950, with the first claimsfor the Nazi development of such a craft coming from a German source,Flugkapitän Rudolf Schriever. Schriever in effect made similar claims toBelluzo, claiming “only that he had developed blueprints,”6 but again, thearticle “lacked any technical meaningful technical information”7 to allow one toassess their veracity by “reverse engineering” the concepts involved.c. Dr Richard Miethe After these initial reports, claims of Nazi flying saucers died down until 1952,when once again the claims surfaced, this time by a “Dr. Richard Miethe”, whichappeared on June 7, 1952, in France-Soir.8 According to this article, Miethestated that he was 40 years old, “and claims that he built a flying saucer—theV7 which he built in 1944, the motors of which the Russians found at Breslau.”9This is a crucial point that we shall return to subsequently, namely, that theRussians recovered some of the actual technical components, and in some versionsof the mythos, some of the documentation and technicians involved.More importantly, Schriever explicitly mentioned that he had been a member ofthe team of former German military and SS officers and engineers sent to Egyptafter the overthrow of King Farouk, where he claimed “he had been working withothers to reconstruct the engine with which his earlier flying disc had beenpowered. The trigger for the expulsion may have been a breakdown in diplomaticrelations between (West] Germany and Egypt.”10 These assertions pose someproblems, partially because they have the ring of truth, and partially becausethe overthrow of King Farouk that brought in the former German Wehrmacht and SSofficers and engineers occurred on July 23, 1952, and yet Miethe’s interviewoccurred the previous month, prior to the coup, and, as far as we know, prior tothe injection of German military personnel and scientists into Egypt in the wakeof the coup! Miethe’s statements, in other words, suggest that this injectionwas secretly underway prior to the coup and that, in fact, there wason-the-ground Nazi presence in Egypt prior to the coup, which was used in thecoup itself.Yet, the first component of Miethe’s interview with France-Soir rings true, foras I have documented elsewhere, the West German government, under the auspicesof the CIA-sponsored coup, brought in military advisors and engineers preciselyto work on missiles for Egypt for use against the newly-established state ofIsrael.11 Even here, however, there is a problem, for why would Miethe, who—ifone is to take the article at face value—had been working for Egypt,subsequently make his way to Israel, the hated enemy of the Nazis? The onlyexplanation that seems plausible is that the Israelis “made him an offer that hecould not refuse.”d. George Klein and Habermohl Besides Miethe, the only alleged eyewitness to the Nazi flying saucers was oneGeorg Klein, who supposedly saw the test flight of the disk Schriever claimed tohave built. There is, in fact, a CIA report of May 27, 1954, that states: > A German newspaper (not further identified] recently published an interview> with George Klein, famous German engineer and aircraft expert, describing the> experimental construction of ‘flying saucers’ carried out by him from 1941 to> 1945. Klein stated that he was present when, in 1945, the first piloted> ‘flying saucer’ took off and reached a speed of 1,3000 miles per hour within 3> minutes. The experiments resulted in three designs: one designed by Miethe was> a disc-shaped aircraft, 135 feet in diameter, which did not rotate; another> designed by Habermohl and Schriever, consisted of a large rotating ring, in> the centre of which was a round, stationary cabin for the crew. When the> Soviets occupied Prague, the Germans destroyed every trace of the ‘flying> saucer’ project and nothing more was heard of Habermohl and his assistants.12> McClure goes on to observe that “The German newspaper appears to have been Weltam Sonntag for (different dates are given] April 25 or 26 1953. The article istitled “Erste ‘Flugscheibe’ flog 1945 in Prag”, and there is a photo of ‘GeorgeKlein’ pointing at the same vague diagram that Lusar reprints.”13 As McClurealso notes, this is the first, and only verifiable, mention of the name ofHabermohl in connection with the alleged development of Nazi flying saucers.14e. Major Rudolf Lusar We come at last to the name that did so much to spread the Nazi UFO mythos:Luftwaffe Major Rudolf Lusar, and his book, first published in 1959 in theUnited Kingdom. Here all the elements of the Nazi UFO mythos were gathered andsummarized, and we italicize the portions of Lusar’s text—cited in full byMcClure—that shall concern us here: > Flying saucers have been whirling round the world since 1947, suddenly turning> up here and there, soaring in and darting off again at unprecedented speed> with flames encircling the rim of the saucer’s disc. They have been located by> radar, pursued by fighters and yet nobody has so far succeeded in establishing> the existence of such a ‘flying saucer’ or managed to ram or shoot one down.> The public, even the experts, are perplexed by an ostensible mystery or a> technical miracle. But slowly the truth is coming out that even during the war> German research workers and scientists made the first moves in the direction> of these “flying saucers”. They built and tested such near-miraculous> contraptions. Experts and collaborators in this work confirm that the first> projects, called “flying discs”, were undertaken in 1941. The designs for> these “flying discs” were drawn up by the German experts Schriever, Habermohl> and Miethe, and the Italian Bellonzo. Habermohl and Schriever chose a wide-> surface ring which rotated round a fixed, cupola-shaped cockpit. The ring> consisted of adjustable wing-discs which could be brought into appropriate> position for the take-off’ or horizontal flight. respectively. Miethe> developed a discus-shaped plate of a diameter of 42m in which adjustable jets> were inserted. Schriever and Habermohl, who worked in Prague, took off with> the first “flying disc” on February 14. 1945. Within three minutes they> climbed to an altitude of I2,400m and reached a speed of 2,000 km/h in> horizontal flight (!] It was intended ultimately to achieve speeds of 4,000> km/h.> Extensive preliminary tests and research were necessary before construction> could be started. Because of the great speed and the extraordinary heat> stress, special heat-resisting materials had to be found. The development,> which cost millions, was almost completed at the end of the war. The then> existing models were destroyed but the plant in Breslau where Miethe worked> fell into the hands of the Russians who took all the material and the experts> to Siberia, where work on these “flying saucers” is being successfully> continued.> Schriever escaped from Prague in time; Habermohl, however, is probably in the> Soviet Union, as nothing is known of his fate. The former designer Miethe is> in the United States and, as far as is known, is building “flying saucers” for> the United States and Canada at the A. V. Roe works. Years ago, the U.S. Air> Force received orders not to fire at “flying saucers”. This is an indication> of the existence of American “flying saucers” which must not be endangered.> The flying shapes so far observed are stated to have diameters of 16, 42, 45> and 75 m respectively and to reach speeds of up to 7,000 km/h. (?]. In 1952> “flying saucers” were definitely established over Korea and Press reports said> they were seen also during the NATO maneuvres in Alsace in the autumn of 1954.> It can no longer be disputed that “flying saucers” exist. But the fact that> their existence is still being denied, particularly in America, because United> States developments have not progressed far enough to match the Soviet> Union’s, gives food for thought. There also seems some hesitation to recognise> that these novel “flying saucers” are far superior to conventional aircraft -> including modern turbo-jet machines - that they surpass their flying> performance, load capacity and maneouvrability and thereby make them> obsolete.15The Nazi UFO mythos has, with Lusar, reached its penultimate form, encompassingthe following elements: > 1] Incredible performance characteristics and clearly a craft that is jet> propelled: “soaring in and darting off again at unprecedented speed with> flames encircling the rim of the saucer’s disc…”> 2] The claim that Nazi scientists were the first to attempt to construct such> “Near-miraculous” craft: “slowly the truth is coming out that even during the> war German research workers and scientists made the first moves in the> direction of these “flying saucers”. They built and tested such> near-miraculous contraptions.”> 3] The crucial element that some of the technology and technicians were> captured by the Soviets who continued the research: “The then existing models> were destroyed but the plant in Breslau where Miethe worked fell into the> hands of the Russians who took all the material and the experts to Siberia,> where work on these “flying saucers” is being successfully continued,” and> finally,> 4] The claim that the other center of postwar research into flying saucer type> craft was continued in the U.S.A. and Canada: “Habermohl, however, is probably> in the Soviet Union, as nothing is known of his fate. The former designer> Miethe is in the United States and, as far as is known, is building “flying> saucers” for the United States and Canada at the A. V. Roe works.”However, there is another component of the Nazi UFO mythos, one much moresensational as we have seen: the claim to have built actual functional fieldpropulsion craft, the so-called Hannebu and Vril series and other miscellaneousclaims of a similar nature.f. The Field Propulsion Saucer MythResearcher Henry Stevens, over a lifetime of research, has assembled what isperhaps the clearest exposition of the development of Nazi field propulsionsaucer claims under one cover, in his Hitler’s Flying Saucers. Stevens comesright to the point in stating what the problem is: > The existence of World War Two German field propulsion flying saucers is a> topic which is denied by virtually every reputable authority in aviation> history. It is also denied by many researchers studying German saucers. The> problem is that in the years immediately following the Second World War the> earth’s skies suddenly began to be populated by flying craft which did some> remarkable things. They flew at unheard of speeds. They made very sharp turns,> seemingly non-aerodynamic turns, even at this extreme speed. They lacked the> glowing tail of jets or rockets but they glowed or gave off light at night> from their periphery or from the whole craft. They were silent or almost> silent. Sometimes they gave off sounds that an electric generator or motor> might make. Sometimes vehicles with electrically based ignition systems ceased> to operate in the presence of these saucers. No government claimed these> flying craft, yet they were seen all over the world.16Indeed, this is the problem posed by the Nazi flying saucer mythos, for the onlyterrestrial government claiming them publicly was a government supposedlydefunct, and it was doing so through a few lone voices in scattered newspaperand magazine articles, voices that claimed to have been associated with theirdevelopment. Moreover, the earliest claims did not involve field propulsion atall.The claims to field propulsion saucer achievements were advanced much later, andby a narrow circle with its own dubious connections to postwar Nazis.17 Andhere, as Stevens notes, the claims and the people advancing them get very murkyindeed, for the claim being advanced in these circles is that the fieldpropulsion saucers were developments from an understanding of the physics basisof obscure occult teachings: > Mention of the “occult” brings us to another line of evidence concerning field> propulsion, that put forth by Norbert Juergen-Ratthoder and Ralf Ettl. Mr.> Ettl became involved while doing research for a film project on Dr. Wernher> von Braun. A film company was paying for this research. A package or several> packages of information were obtained by the production company which had more> to do with UFOs than rocketry. This information was laid aside by Mr. Ettl but> he returned to it after enlisting the help of Norbert Juergen-Ratthofer who> had a special interest in that subject.> The package contained breathtakingly clear photographs of German saucers in> flight. Some of these pictures may be just models but some look authentic and> are posed against a landscape. Nowadays, pictures can be generated via> computer and these pictures surfaced within modern times…> Besides the pictures, these writers provide an entire historical and cultural> context for these saucers within the Third Reich. This context involves secret> organizations with the SS. Further, the context provided by these writers> (involves] the occult, channeling, and extraterrestrials. This is the weak> point of their presentation since the case for these latter connections is> really not strong enough to be in evidence.18Indeed, it is this same group that promulgated the idea, through anotherresearcher, Jan Van Helsing, that the Germans, through the use of mediums,“channeled” technical information—in Sumerian!— for the construction of thealleged saucers, having contacted extraterrestrials by this means.19 Shades ofAdamski once again.We note that we are confronted with a kind of “Nazi version” of the infamousCooper-Cantwheel Majic-12 documents: packages that allegedly arrive at a filmproduction company from some anonymous source, in this case, containingphotographs and diagrams of alleged German field propulsion saucers. It goeswithout saying that a film production company could indeed hoax photographs of“Nazi flying saucers.”It is here, with the Juergen-Raffhofer group and this package of pictures andalleged “plans,” that the now infamous Hannebu and Vril saucers made their firstmajor appearance, spawning further elaborations of the mythos that the Nazisactually mounted manned Moon missions, and even a “suicidal” one way mission toMars! > Mr. Juergen-Ratthofer, Mr. Ettle and allied writers offer two different> systems for field propulsion. the smaller saucer-type, which they designate> “Vril” was powered by three moving magnetic fields. The larger type,> designated “Haunebu” was powered by a series of devices according to these> writers. In this arrangement, the output of smaller of the Hans Coler “free> energy” devices, the “Magnetapparat”, was used to supply input for the larger> Coler device, the “Stromerzueger”. The output of this second device was used> to turn a Van de Graaf generator. This energy was directed into something> called a Marconi ball dynamo (which] supplied lift to the saucer.> All that seems to have been said about the latter device is that it is> mentioned in the same sentence with special saucer condensers developed by> (Thomas Townsend] Brown and Professor Paul Biefeld in the ninteen wtenties and> that “such” (“solche”] with a rotor system was done by Professor Marconi, in> Italy, in the nineteen thirties. Mr. Juergen-Ratthofer goes on to say that> this device is to be considered, in principle, a forerunner to the Searl> system.20> The Haunebu pictures strongly resemble the Adamski saucer pictures of the> early 1950s… Mr. Ettle and Mr. Juergen-Ratthofer maintain that these “Adamski> saucers” are really the German-designed Haunebu type saucers. Since they were> flown after the war, certain questions as to their origin arise.21Leaving aside for a moment any commentary on the dubious technological andhistorical claims—claims no doubt made to provide an aura of “veracity” to thestory—we note that two memes have now been joined in the Nazi saucer mythos,that of Nazi technological prowess, with Adamski’s “extraterrestrial contact.”Why this has occurred will be explored more fully in the next chapter.This fusion of the memes of extraterrestrial contact, occult influences andpractice, and Nazi technology reached the zenith with the claims of Jan VanHelsing, who maintained that in the interwar period, mediums made contact withan extraterrestrial civilization, which civilization communicated technologicalinformation allowing the Germans to build a flying saucer.22The reader will have noticed an immediate problem, and this is the historicalgap between the earliest appearances of German suction saucer stories in theearly 1950s, Adamski’s contact stories from the same period, and the much laterclaims—with little substantiation—of field propulsion saucers.2. The Gap and the Critics of the Mythos We may now gain an appreciation of the problematic posed by the historical gapin these reports of jet-propelled and field propulsion saucers by pointing outthe observations of researcher Andy Roberts Brigantia: > 1. Prior to 1950, no claim was made of any successful flight by high> performance circular or spherical aircraft in Germany during the war.> 2. No contemporary documentary evidence (from before 1946] hasbeen produced> regarding any successful flight by high performance circular or spherical> aircraft in Germany during the war.> 3. The only sources of original information and evidence for the wide,> circular ‘Schriever, Habermohl, Miethe and Bellonzo Flying Disc’ come from a> brief news agency report quoted in Der Spiegel in 1950, under the name of a> “Captain Rudolph Schriever” (also possibly appearing at the same time in the> Italian press], and from German Secret Weapons of the Second World War by> Major Rudolf Lusar, published in Germany in 1957, and in London and New York> in 1959. Schriever seems to suggest that the craft did not progress beyond> blueprint stage, but Lusar appears to have taken the ‘Schriever’ account,> turned the planned speed and height figures into ones that had actually been> achieved, changed some of the technical details, and added the vague,> non-technical drawing of this supposed craft which has been reprinted in> various contexts since.> I am not aware that Schreiver’s existence has ever been confirmed, and no> proof has been produced to show that Lusar would have had direct access—denied> to conventional historians—to any source of information about such a ‘flying> disc’, which he claims “climbed to an altitude of 12,400m” “within three> minutes”, “and reached a speed of 2,000 kmh”, on 14 February 1945. There is no> independent evidence which suggests that these claims have any basis in fact.> An extensive search of conventional literature on the war, together with> German encyclopedias, has found no mention of Lusar, or of any ‘Flying Disc’> with such a performance record.> 4. The only source of original information and evidence for the spherical> craft described as Feuerball and Kugelblitz is the writer Renato Vesco, author> of (the English title] Intercept— But Don’t Shoot, published in Italy in 1968> and in the USA in 1971, and of two other books in Italian. He was also the> first to make the link between those alleged craft and various reports of> light anomalies during the war, suggesting that they were the cause of the> ‘foo fighter’ phenomenon. No proof has been produced to show how or why Vesco> would have had access—denied to conventional historians—to any source of> information about these flying spheres, and there is no independent evidence> which suggests that these claims forFeuerball and Kugelblitz have any basis in> fact. An extensive search of conventional literature on the war together with> Italian encyclopedias, has found no mention of Vesco, or the Feuerball and> Kugelblitz.> 5. There is no contemporary (pre-1946], or other documentary proof of any> kind for the existence or flight, during the war, or at any other time, of the> unconventional ‘flying saucer’ craft known as Vril and Haunebu. The material> suggesting that these craft, and the related methods of propulsion, existed> appears to have made its first appearance some 40 years after the war. An> extensive search of conventional literature on the war has found no mention of> Vril or Haunebu.> 6. Schriever and Lusar make no mention of the Feuerball and Kugelblitz. Vesco> makes no mention of the ‘Schriever, Habermohl, Miethe and Bellonzo Flying> Disc’. Neither Lusar nor Vesco mention the Vril or Haunebu craft.23Without prejudice to the main arguments advanced by Brigantia, it should benoted with respect to the last point that if there was any truth to the claimsof Schriever, Lusar, and Vesco, it is unlikely that in the highlycompartmentalized secret weapons projects of the Third Reich, that any of themwere likely to have known of the projects the others were working on.3. A Critique of the Critics: The Suction Saucers In my book Roswell and the Reich I noted that there is at least some evidencefor the existence of German suction saucers, in that during the 1950s, theGerman engineer Heinrich Fleissner attempted to take out a patent on such acraft in the United States—patent number 2,939,648—based on work he claimed tohave done earlier in the Third Reich at the secret Peenemünde rocket facility.24As I noted there, this craft looks suspiciously like the declassified plans forthe American “Project Silverbug” flying saucer of the same period, and indeed,the delay in awarding Fleissner his patent when he filed in 1955, to its finalaward, was an unheard of five-plus years, ample time for the Air Force to copyand modify his designs.Additionally, it is incontestable that the suction saucer designs of ViktorSchauberger, who unquestionably also worked for the SS on similar designs, wasof interest to postwar American corporations and engineers.25 Thus, one mustassume that the Americans had some knowledge of German saucer research, howeversketchy, and that they were also involved in psychological operationsobfuscating their existence.B. The Historical Gap, the Gehlen Organization, and Psychological Warfare So how does one rationalize the sudden appearance of these reports concerningNazi flying saucer accomplishments in the early 1950s, along with the claims ofAdamski? There is one important clue overlooked by most advocates—andopponents—of the Nazi UFO mythos, and that is the possibility of psychologicaloperations within the wider context of the postwar intelligence arrangementsbetween the CIA and Nazi military intelligence.As I have repeatedly pointed out in my books on Nazi secret weapons, the Bellproject, and the continuation of Nazism after the war, one of the crucialinterfaces between the western elite, its agencies of power, and the postwarNazi “International” was Nazi general Reinhard Gehlen’s military intelligenceunit, Fremde Heere Ost, or Foreign Armies East, a vast network of spies withinthe Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Gehlen undertook negotiations with OSSstation chief in Zurich, Allen Dulles, to turn this network over to Americanintelligence at the conclusion of the war, provided that he, General Gehlen,remain in day-to-day operational control of this network. As I observed in TheSS Brotherhood of the Bell, this meant effectively that when the ink was dry onthe National Security Act of 1947, the CIA’s civilian character was alreadycompromised, for the CIA’s on-the-ground Soviet intelligence and analysisdivision was, virtually in its entirety, General Gehlen’s Nazi militaryintelligence group, otherwise known at the time as the Gehlen Organization, orsimply, the “Gehlenorg.” This organization often worked in close conjunctionwith other postwar Nazi organizations such as ODESSA and The Spider, theKameradenwerk and the Bruderschaft.This is a crucial point, for it means that in the postwar period and well intothe 1950s, the CIA’s on-the-ground intelligence network, not only in EasternEurope and the Soviet Union, but also in Western Europe, was largely a Naziorganization under nominal American command.Within this context, the CIA sponsored covert operations from 1949-1950 toprevent Italy from electing a Communist government, and, as I have detailedelsewhere, also was in nominal control to overthrow Egyptian King Farouk.26 TheGehlenorg, during this same time period, had given its American cousins in theCIA an analysis of Soviet military capabilities and intentions, an estimate thatso deliberately over-estimated these capabilities and intentions that it was oneof the crucial factors in driving the postwar American arms race and doctrine of“containment.”We now propose that the sudden appearance of Nazi suction-saucer stories duringthis crucial period of Cold War tensions was not accidental, but an intentionalpsychological operation of this CIA-Gehlenorg nexus, designed to do two things: > 1] On the American side, to convince the Soviets that the alleged Nazi> technology fell into American hands, and thus, that America had a preponderant> technological advantage in air power over the Soviets;> 2] On the Nazi side, the purpose was, as I shall argue below, two fold yet> again:> a] To obfuscate the real story of suction saucer development; and,> b] To obfuscate the development of genuine field propulsion technology,> namely, the Bell.1. The Bell Story and the Nazi UFO Mythos: Core Elements The last point may not be entirely clear until we compare it, on the one hand,to the wild claims for Nazi field propulsion saucers, claims which are, inthemselves, baseless and unfounded, and on the other hand, to the story of theBell itself. As we have seen, there are two core components of the Nazi Saucermythos: > 1] The suction saucers were developed in Nazi Germany and some were actually> flown in test flights shortly before the end of the war, and,> 2] Some of this technology and the technicians and documentation associated> with it fell into Soviet hands and continued to be secretly developed by them> after the war.As has been seen, there is at least some threadbare evidence that something likea suction saucer project was underway in Nazi Germany, both at Peenemünde(Fleissner], and within the SS (Schauberger], but these projects have nothing todo with the claims of Schriever, Belluzo, and others.But what of the field propulsion component of the mythos?Here, there is no evidence of anything like the “Hannebu” and “Vril” saucers,other than the wild contactee fantasies of Adamski—whose technologicaldescriptions we have noted in a previous chapter are suspiciously like the Bellproject—and the even wilder fantasias of Jürgen-Ratthofer, Ettl, and VanHelsing. With respect to the Bell project, this device gave off such deadlyfield effects that, reports of its ability to levitate notwithstanding, it isunquestionable that any human inside the device would have been exposed to fataland deadly forces.27 Its use in practice as a manned field propulsion craftwould have been nil. Additionally, there are no reports of the Bell exhibitingthe performance capabilities of UFOs, though certainly the implications of itsreported levitation open up such potentialities.28In the version of the Bell story recounted by Igor Witkowski, Nick Cook, andmyself, the evidence for the project is based upon a tapestry of bits ofevidence that, taken together, allow one to “reverse engineer” the parameters ofthe project: > 1] the Polish war crimes trial affidavit of SS general Jakob Sporrenberg, who> was sentenced to death in Poland for the murder of some 60 scientists and> technicians involved with the project. It should now be noted that Witkoski> holds open the possibility that, during Sporrenberg’s execution, a last minute> substitution of a double was made, and Sporrenberg himself was spirited out of> Poland by the Soviet N.K.V.D., forerunner of the KGB,29 thus, there is a> Soviet connection to the only known Nazi field propulsion project, exactly as> was seen in the Nazi UFO mythos;> 2] The Bell project was known to have been developed in lower Silesia, and> there are installations in the region that would be commensurate with such a> project. Similarly, the Nazi UFO mythos consistently locates the base of> operations in lower Silesia, in the provincial capital of Breslau (modern day> Wroclaw, Poland]; and, finally> 3] It is possible to “reverse engineer” the physics conceptions of the Bell> based on descriptions of the device, and other data.30 By following the clues> of these conceptions, it is clear that the Nazis continued to research this> project independently in Juan Peron’s Argentina in the early 1950s in Dr.> Ronald Richter’s “controlled fusion” project.31 These conceptions involved:> a] high speed mechanical and electrical counter-rotation of a plasma inducing> substance composed most likely of mercury and thorium 229 isomer oxide, to> achieve magnetic fields separation and a quasi-super-conductive state; and,> b] high voltage direct current stressing of that plasma, to create momentary> fusion reactions in the substance.The basic goal of all of this, as I have argued elsewhere, is to create a“torsion shear” effect in the fabric of space time, a kind of “gravity bubble”around the device, which would account for its ionizing radiation and reportedlevitation.Interestingly enough, a patent, filed on May 17, 1988, exists for anelectromagnetic plasma reactor that sounds suspiciously like the concepts of Dr.Ronald Richter some three decades previously, concepts for which he was roundlydenounced. The claims for thispatent read as follows:> What is claimed is:> 1. A plasma arc reactor for refining raw materials comprising: spaced> electrode means including at least one anode electrode defining a reaction> chamber and at least one cathode electrode mounted within said reaction> chamber and variably spaced from said anode electrode; electrical circuit> means connected to said anode and cathode electrodes for creating a plasma arc> within said reaction chamber; and an induction coil means externally mounted> circumferentially about said reaction chamber for producing a magnetic field> therein.> 2. The plasma arc reactor of claim 1, wherein said anode electrode comprises> a hollow elongated cylinder having a central vertical longitudinal axis and> opposed first and second closed ends.> 3. The plasma reactor of claim 2, wherein said anode electrode defines a> reaction chamber comprising a frusto-conical interior cavity.> 4. The plasma reactor of claim 2, wherein said reaction chamber comprises a> frusto-conical interior cavity which tapers from a small interior diameter at> said first end to a larger interior diameter at said second end.> 5. The plasma reactor of claim 4, wherein said reactor includes support means> secured to said anode electrode, said support means operating to move said> anode electrode along the longitudinal axis thereof relative to the cathode.> 6. The plasma arc reactor of claim 1, wherein said induction coil means> operates to impose a magnetic field within said reaction chamber to rotate> said plasma arc.> 7. The plasma arc reactor of claim 3, wherein said induction coil means> operates to impose a magnetic field within said reaction chamber to rotate> said plasma arc produced between said anode electrode and said cathode> electrode.> 8. The plasma arc reactor of claim 7, wherein said cathode electrode> comprises a spherical, cathode ball electrode spaced from said anode electrode> within said reaction chamber.> 9. The plasma arc reactor of claim 8, wherein said reactor incudes support> means secured to said anode electrode, said support means operating to move> said anode electrode along the longitudinal axis thereof relative to said> cathode ball electrode.> 10. The plasma arc reactor of claim 9, wherein said cathode ball electrode is> mounted within said reaction chamber, on a cathode stem, said cathode stem> extending out said first closed end of said reaction chamber.> 11. The plasma arc reactor of claim 10, wherein said cathode stem is rotatably> mounted to allow rotation of said cathode ball electrode within said reaction> chamber.> 12. The plasma arc reactor of claim 1, wherein said plasma sustaining gas is> an inert gas.> 13. The plasma arc reactor of claim 12, wherein said reactor includes means> for admitting said gas to said reaction chamber in a flow counter to the force> of gravity.32This patent indicates something quite profound about the Bell and Richter story,namely, that with the Bell project, unlike for the alleged Nazi field propulsionUFOs, the physics conceptions involved are real, and consistent over time andwith notions and inventions that emerge much later in the public record. It isthus reasonable to locate the core of the Nazi UFO story with the Bell project,and to view that project as being decades in advance of Allied or Soviettechnology of the era.But what, ultimately, was the origin of the idea of coupling such advancedtechnology with a psychological operation? And what was the purpose of thispsychological operation? We have alluded to some of these purposes already. Theorigin, as we have suggested in this chapter, was the Nazis themselves. But thedark purposes for which they conceived of this elaborate operation remain to beexplored in the next two chapters. But the real origin, and real purpose, wasperhaps hinted at in the other component of the Nazi UFO mythos: the esoteric,and the religious and social engineering themes first enunciated in GeorgeAdamski’s contactee stories.The real story, as we shall now see, is very murky indeed, and it all beginswith a strange remark of Nazi Propaganda Minister Dr. Josef Göbbels…image [images/00019.jpg] Nazi Propaganda Minister Dr. Josef Göbbels 1 Andy Roberts Brigantia, “Secrets of Lies?

Black Knight was found tobe many, many times larger than any current satellite orbiting our planet.\"Stephen Williams1Reich Propaganda Minister Dr. Josef Göbbels’ wife, Magda, sometime aroundChristmas of 1944, told her sister-in-law that her husband had seen a secretweapon “so visionary” that it would ensure a wonderful victory.2 The problemhere, of course, for traditional or conventional interpretation is thatGermany’s V-1s and V-2s were already raining destruction down on London andother Western European cities, and Germany’s jets had already taken to theskies, and Germany’s various anti-aircraft missiles were already being fired atAllied bombers. In other words, whatever it was that the Propaganda Minister hadseen, it was not any of these things. It was, nonetheless, something that, asIgor Witkowski observes, must have “physically existed at the end of that year,”and which created an astounding, “‘visionary’ impression through its appearancealone—therefore it must have been something completely different to the weaponsknown up until then.”3To make matters very much worse, apparently Hitler’s favorite commando, SSColonel Otto Skorzeny, had seen something very similar, and proposed utilizingit in a novel fashion. And among all the Third Reich’s weird and wonderfularsenal, there is nothing as visionary as its alleged suction saucers, and themore promising Bell project.A. The Sonderkampf of the Weltanschauungskrieg:The Nazi Bell and the Beginning of the Coupling of Advanced Technology andPsychological OperationsThe idea of using such advanced technologies as represented by UFOs inconjunction with psychological operations thus begins - once again - in WorldWar Two, and once again, it is the Nazis who came up with the idea. I mentionthis first in The SS Brotherhood of the Bell,4 but its importance for ourdiscussion here is too crucial, so I will expand upon it here. The idea of usingadvanced technology with “special operations” or “special warfare” was firstnoticed, predictably enough, by Polish researcher Igor Witkowski, who mentionsit in his superb study of Nazi secret weapons projects, The Truth About theWunderwaffe: > Later, in documents brought over from the American NARA archive at College> Park near Washington, I found among other things a report referring to the> interrogation of one of Otto Skorzeny’s commandos. He was Skorzeny’s> aide-de-camp, SS-Sturmbannführer Karl Radl, at the same time Chief of the> VI-S/2 Division at the General Office for Reich’s Security (RSHA -> Reichs-sicherheithauptamt). Radl stated —would you believe it —that since the> beginning of 1944 Skorzeny simply had no head to organize acts of sabotage on> the enemy’s rear areas, since he had come into contact with the \"wonder> weapon\" and as a result had \"been possessed\" by the idea of \"Sonderkampf> (\"Special Warfare\"), regarding the use of this weapon, to such an extent, that> he considered it the only sure way to win the war.5But what exactly did Skorzeny mean by a Sonderkampf or special warfare beingconducted by his SS commando “Black Knights”?Generally speaking, the term meant precisely commando-style actions such assabotage in enemy rear areas, but it also meant, in the Nazis’ case, antipartisan actions. But clearly, given the context of Witkowski’s observations,Skorzeny was already commanding such actions, so clearly he had something quitedifferent in mind entirely.One answer might lie in the Nazis’ conception of Weltanschauungskrieg, or “WorldView Warfare,” their term for what we would call “psychological warfare,” thoughthe German term is, as is evident, much deeper and more comprehensive. But howdoes Weltanschauungskrieg differ from standard psychological operations? Toanswer this question, we must delve deeply into its Americancounterpart—psychological warfare—for as we shall see in future chapters, clearindications emerge of a Nazi nexus with American corporations and foundations, anexus forged prior to the war. What we propose to do in this and the nextchapter, in other words, is to “reverse engineer” not a technology, but apsychological operation deliberately conceived in connection with thattechnology.1. The Components of Psyops In early 1948, the U.S. Army circulated a top-secret definition of psychologicalwarfare. This definition was the distilled experience of waging psychologicalwarfare against an equally talented opposition when it came to propaganda: NaziGermany. In the U.S. Army’s case,> Psychological warfare employs all moral and physical means, other than> orthodox military operations, which tend to:> a. destroy the will and ability of the enemy to fight.> b. deprive him of the support of his allies and neutrals.> c. increase in our own troops and allies the will to victory.> Psychological warfare employs any weapon to influence the mind of the enemy.> The weapons are psychological only in the effect they produce and not because> of the nature of the weapons themselves. In this light, overt (white), covert> (black), and gray propaganda; subversion; sabotage; special operations,;> guerilla warfare; espionage; political, cultural, economic, and racial> pressures are all effective weapons. They are effective because they produce> dissension, distrust, fear and hopelessness in the minds of the enemy, not> because they originated in the psyche of the propaganda or psychological> warfare agencies.6Note carefully the implication of these statements, for clearly the U.S. Army iscoupling the idea of technologies—“the weapons themselves”—with a matrix orcontext with which they are to be interpreted to \"produce dissention, distrust,fear and hopelessness\" in a target population.While those technologies are not specified in the document, clearly they must beof such an advanced nature that they lend themselves to use in psychologicaloperations; in other words, we are looking at the conceptual matrix of apsychological warfare operation tailor made to exploit the properties ofUFOs—whether they are terrestrial or extraterrestrial in origin—in order toconfuse and demoralize a target population.In respect to the distinction between black and white propaganda, communicationsresearcher Christopher Simpson—whom we have quoted above—notes that blackpropaganda > “…stresses trouble, confusion… and terror.\"7> A variation of black propaganda tactics involves forging enemy documents and> distributing them to target audiences as a means of discrediting rival powers.> The U.S. government officially denies that it employs black propaganda, but in> fact it has long been an integral aspect of U.S. foreign and domestic policy.8Ponder that last line carefully……for those familiar with the role of documents within UFOlogy will immediatelyrecall two infamous cases when documents purporting to deal with the subject ofUFOs were mailed to various recipients from anonymous or pseudonymous sources,from the Majic-12 documents to the “SS Hannebu and Vril” documents.And this has a profound implication for our purposes. Given the indicationsalready explored that both the SS and the U.S. Army conceived of psychologicaloperations in conjunction with the use or display of advanced technology, andgiven the pre- and post-war links to be explored later in this book, thepossibility emerges that we are dealing with two components of one psychologicaloperation, one component of which stresses the extraterrestrial origins of thistechnology, and another which stresses its Nazi origin. Additionally, eachcomponent—the American one and the Nazi one—while coordinated, might alsorepresent underlying factions or “vested interests” within our “breakawaycivilization.”One purpose of this seemingly implausible coordination, according to Simpson, isto “manage empire” and to function “as an instrument for maintaining grosslyabusive social structures, notably in global North/South relations.”9 In thecase of our “breakaway civilization,” this function would be redefined tomaintain the abusive and parasitic relationship between it and its “host”societies.Furthermore, in the maintenance of such a hidden empire, the breakawaycivilization will, like its more conventional counterparts, utilize all thecomponents of psychological operations, from “techniques of persuasion, opinionmeasurement”, i.e., polling, “interrogation, political and militarymobilization, propagation of ideology,”10 to “social psychology, communicationeffect studies, anthropological studies of foreign communication systems,”11 andso on. It is my contention that given the necessarily small population base ofany such breakaway civilization, plus the fact that it is coupled to a matrix ofadvanced infrastructure to conduct and deploy its advanced technologies, thatits primary method of military operations will be precisely via psychologicalwarfare operations to compensate for its much smaller population base.2. Managing Perceptions: The Engineering of a Scientific Consensus Given that one principal goal of psychological warfare is to manage perceptionsof a target group or population, and thus to inhibit or otherwise influence thatgroup’s decision-making and world-interpreting processes, and given that thereis a clear and explicit coupling of advanced technologies with psychologicalwarfare operations both in the conceptions of the U.S. Army and of SS ColonelOtto Skorzeny, it is worth noting that one of the principal targets of such“perception management” is the scientific community itself. As Simpson notes,the very study of psychological warfare, of communications science, “becamesomething like a Rorschach test through which favored academics spoke about theworld as they believed it to be, and thereby helped institutionalize that visionat the expense of its rivals.”12 This is, in strictest terms, already somethingbeyond “psychological warfare” in the traditional sense, and approaches what theNazis meant by Weltanschauungs-krieg or “World View Warfare,” for the effect ofthe promotion of certain views and scientists who hold them, is to create a“matrix of interpretation” or “matrix of perception”, which matrix in turn opensup only certain avenues of decision and action.What came of this activity—at least in the case of the United States—was atransformation of the scientific method and community itself, with the creationof a “publicly received and officially sanctioned ‘science’,” and a hiddenscience privy only to those in the black community itself (about which we shallhave more to say subsequently): > U.S. psychological warfare programs between 1945 and 1960 provide a case study> of how the priorities and values of powerful social groups can be transformed> into the \"received knowledge\" of the scientific community, and, to a certain> extent, of society as a whole. It is a twofold story, first of the successes> and failures of the government’s effort to achieve the engineering of consent> of targeted populations at home and abroad, and, contained within that, the> story of the mechanisms by which consent was achieved among the scientists who> had been hired to help with the job.13Obviously, Simpson means his remarks to apply not to our breakaway civilization,but to the efforts of U.S. psychological warfare operations during the Cold War,to buttress its own ideological position in the targeted populations of the Westand the Third World, in opposition to the supposed expansionist aims of theCommunist bloc and its ideology.But it takes little imagination to see how such operations would be used by abreakaway civilization to create a false scientific consensus in all scientificdisciplines—from physics to genetics to sociology—that related to its own secretresearch, to prevent the widespread dissemination of ideas or concepts thatformed the basis of its research when possible, and to direct themis-interpretation of them when it could not. This leads us directly to…3. The Techniques of Obfuscation Within the American conception of psychological operations, various techniquesof obfuscation have emerged, techniques designed to inhibit the interpretive anddecision-making faculties of target groups directly. The two most salientcomponents of these techniques are “the use of ‘plausible deniability’ to permitthe government to deny responsibility for ‘black’ operations that were in truthoriginated by the United States;’\" and “a conscious policy of polarizing neutralnations into either ‘pro-’ or ‘anti-U.S.’ camps.”14 In the case of the breakawaycivilization, these two techniques are quite the crucial points, for on the onehand, such a civilization must seek both to cloak the technologies it isutilizing, and to cloak or deny its own very existence, and on the other hand,must obfuscate the interpretation of its technologies in case they arediscovered.With respect to the last point, in a previous book, Roswell and the Reich, Inoted the creation of what I called “the Roswell dialectic,” a creation I notedthat was linked to the U.S. military which was seeking to control theinterpretation, to manage the perceptions, of the Roswell event, by casting theinterpretation into one of two alternatives: either it had to beextraterrestrial, or it was a purely mundane event that had been misinterpreted;it was, in short, either a crashed extraterrestrial craft, or merely a mistakenballoon of some sort. In other words, Roswell—whatever the reality of the eventunderlying the interpretations—showed all the classic hallmarks of apsychological warfare operation.15 This dialectic is a classic case of theemployment of the “polarization” technique, only in this case, is it not apro-US or anti-US posture that the target group is being urged to take, butrather, a pro-ET or an anti-ET posture with respect to the alleged recoveredtechnology.4. American Private Foundation Funding of Psyops Studies None of this, however, establishes that one is dealing with a breakawaycivilization in the sense that Mr. Dolan hypothesized, and that we reviewed inchapter one. For such a case to begin to gain some prima facie credence, onewould have to show that forces, powers, and/or “instruments”— in Quigley’ssense—that were more or less private and independent of the government wereinvolved in the formulation and deployment of psychological warfare operations.Fortunately, we do have evidence, highly suggestive evidence, that this indeedis the case, for during World War Two, not only did the U.S. government allocate“between $7 million and $13 million annually for university and think-tankstudies of communications-related social psychology, communication effectstudies” and “anthropological studies of foreign communication systems,”16 butmajor foundations, including the Carnegie, Ford, and Rockefeller Foundationsalso privately funded this research,17 thus gaining access to the results ofthese studies. As we shall discover in the last section of this book, the nexusbetween the Ford and Rockefeller interests on the one hand, and Nazism on theother, predate the war, and form a vital component of the matrix in which thecrystal of the breakaway civilization, and its conception of its relationship toits host societies, is grown. For the moment, however, we note that there is adirect and established relationship between powerful private groups andfinancial interests, and the rise of psychological warfare as a component of“managing empire,” in this case, the private empires represented by thoseinterests.5. Back to the Nazi Component:The Implications of Weltanschauungskrieg It is important to understand that psychological warfare operations developedduring World War Two largely as a response to the totalitarian state of NaziGermany, and its ideological understanding that psychological warfare was a“World View Warfare:” > The phrase ‘psychological warfare’ is reported to have first entered English> in 1941 as a translated mutation of the Nazi term Weltanschauungskrieg> (literally, worldview warfare), meaning the purportedly scientific application> of propaganda, terror, and state pressure as a means of securing an> ideological victory over one’s enemies. William “Wild Bill” Donovan, then> director of the newly established U.S. intelligence agency Office of Strategic> Services (OSS), viewed an understanding of Nazi psychological tactics as a> vital sources of ideas for “Americanized” versions of many of the same> strategems.18Of course, this raises the philosophical question of just how much of thisessentially Nazi conception can be “borrowed” and “Americanized” before the Naziideology itself comes to dominate the process, transforming the society adoptingit. How can such processes of “scientific manipulations” via propaganda, terror,and state pressure via mass communication, of targeted populations cohabitatewith the ideal of a free and independent people?The answer, of course, is that it cannot. Thus, the process of the“Nazification” of the West began before the war was even over. Peter Levendasummarizes the effect of this “psychological total war” thatWeltanschauungskreig implies with chillingly apt accuracy: > “World-view warfare” says it all: a battle between our perceptions and those> of an enemy population. After all, one could say, isn’t that what war is> really about anyway?… Even the most crazed suicide bomber is acting from a> belief that what he is doing is right, morally justified, and has the sanction> of the people that matter, the people that count: God’s people. “The best,”> says the poem, “lack all conviction,” but rob the worst of their conviction> and the war is over.

Indeed, the idea of such total psychological “fullspectrum dominance” owes its origin to the “total totalitarian” Weltanschauungof Nazism.But there are crucial differences between “psychological warfare” as theAmerican component of this breakaway civilization practiced it, and the Nazione, and they are revealed in the ideological principles of each.In this respect, it is to be stressed that Nazism arose as a fully-formedbreakaway civilization, being midwifed into existence by a variety of occult andsecret societies, eventually capturing an entire great power, and wrenching thatpower away from its roots within Western civilization, and orienting it alongentirely new ideological lines, the components of which included: > 1) the belief that it was racially superior to other races both genetically,> culturally, and technologically, and, more importantly,> 2) within the “state within a state” that was the SS, the further belief that> this race, the Aryans, descended from an “extraterrestrial” race; and that it> was this descent that gave it its alleged racial, genetic, and intellectual> superiority over others; and finally,> 3) that no conventional moral inhibitions or restraints were permissible—and> indeed had to be jettisoned—to return this “master race” to its “rightful> position” within world affairs.In short, the ideological commitments of Nazism were at variance with thebroader foundations of Western civilization, and thus, Nazi Germany itself maybe viewed as an attempt of the breakaway civilization to “go public.” As weshall encounter later, the elitism implied in this view squared quite well withsimilar views in the corporate elites of the USA, forming a perfect nexus forthe postwar re-emergence of the breakaway civilization.For the moment, however, we now return to SS Colonel Otto Skorzeny and his callsfor a “special warfare” or Sonderkampf and to a consideration of theirimplications within this wider context of Weltanschauungskrieg and the aboveideological components of Nazism. Let us recall Witkowski’s summary: > Later, in documents brought over from the American NARA archive at College> Park near Washington, I found among other things a report referring to the> interrogation of one of Otto Skorzeny’s commandos. He was Skorzeny’s> aide-de-camp, SS-Sturmbannführer Karl Radl, at the same time Chief of the> VI-S/2 Division at the General Office for Reich’s Security (RSHA -> Reichs-sicherheitshauptamt). Radl stated —would you believe it - that since> the beginning of 1944 Skorzeny simply had no head to organize acts of sabotage> on the enemy’s rear areas, since he had come into contact with the \"wonder> weapon\" and as a result had \"been possessed\" by the idea of \"Sonderkampf> (\"Special Warfare\"), regarding the use of this weapon, to such an extent, that> he considered it the only sure way to win the war.20Under ordinary circumstances, Sonderkampf meant precisely “special battle” or“special operations”, comprising guerilla warfare, sabotage, assassination, andother operations behind enemy lines.21But clearly, Skorzeny had seen a technology of some sort that had to besomething other than the V-1s, V-2s, and jet airplanes, for none of these wouldeasily lend themselves to “guerilla operations” behind enemy lines. In otherwords, some other technology entirely was involved.Additionally, Skorzeny, as Witkowski notes, no longer believed in theeffectiveness of special warfare behind enemy lines, or, to put it differently,Skorzeny, like many Nazi officers, realized the war was lost, and that there wasno reason to do so. So what did Skorzeny mean by a Sonderkampf, a specialguerilla warfare in this case?I believe there can be only one reasonable answer. Since the war was lost, the“enemy lines” meant, quite literally, a new kind of special guerilla warfare wasto be waged from a postwar Nazi underground, quite literally “behind enemylines” which would in the aftermath of the war, cover the entire globe, and thatwarfare was deliberately conceived in conjunction with an advanced technologythat, in the hands of Weltanschauungskrieg experts, would be used to spreadfear, terror, confusion, and thereby to demoralize the enemy, short circuit hisworld-interpretation and decision making processes.But what, precisely, was that technology?Here we are in the fortunate position of not having to guess, nor to argue, thecase that it was some version of the German suction saucers, or perhaps evensome scaled down version of the Bell itself:image [images/00020.jpg] Denver Post, November 9, 1947 Article About Spanish NationalistLeader General Francisco Franco’s Alleged Flying Saucer22The article reads as follows: > Spies Bid for Franco’s Weapons> Agents Ascribe ‘Flying Saucers’ to New Rocket> By Lionel Shaprio.> GENEVA- Three German scientists working under the personal sponsorship of> Generalissimo Francisco Franco have developed two highly advanced weapons of> war, according to specifications and blueprints smuggled out of Spain by the> agent of an independent European spy organization.> The first weapon is an electromagnetic rocket which, it is claimed, is> responsible for the “flying saucers” seen over the North American continent> last summer and for at least one and perhaps two hitherto unexplained> accidents to transport aircraft.> The second weapon is an artillery warhead employing the principles of nuclear> energy and described as having a startling disintegrating power.> Blueprints of the weapons have been offered for sale to at least three of the> great powers. The degree of credence placed in them by the military> intelligence sections of these powers is indicated by the fact that two of> them—of whom this correspondent has certain knowledge—have made strenuous> efforts to acquire the blueprints.> Big Sums Offered> The disclosure that these plans were available has touched off the most> intense activity among secret agents in European capitals since the end of the> war. Huge sums of money and even threats of death have been involved in the> negotiations.> The nation which coupled a threat of death to its bid is Soviet Russia.> I came upon the story three weeks ago by accidental interception of a document> cataloguing the weapons. This was being circulated through Europe’s intricate> network of secret agents. Since then, careful military intelligence> organizations in several countries has disclosed:> That the principal powers fully believe Franco has been developing new> weapons.> That the weapons (particularly the electro-magnetic rocket) do actually exist> and are now being manufactured in Spain.> According to the information available, the weapons were located near Marbella> on the south coast of Spain just east of Gibraltar. They were tested in> Franco’s presence early last summer. The rocket, known as KM2 after its> inventors, Professors Knoh and Mueller—was tested of Malaga while Franco> watched from the deck of his yacht.> The agent who smuggled the blueprints out of Spain, and who presumably was> present at the tests, claims that the rockets were directed over North America> and that they were responsible for at least one and probably two> transport-plane accidents which, for want of better explanation, were> attributed to structural defects.> The nuclear-energy projectile is credited to a Professor Halkmann. It is> described as twenty-two centimeters (8.7 inches) long and is used as a warhead> for artillery shells. The agent claims that Franco is already mass-producing> guns to fire these new shells and that the first tests of the projectiles show> them to have unprecedented explosive qualities.23The article makes a number of specific assertions, and there are two basicapproaches by which to interpret them within the assumption that the articlerepresents a psychological operation of some sort.The first is that the article contains some kernels of truth, i.e., that somesort of advanced technology was being worked on by German scientists in postwarNationalist Spain. The second is to assume that the article contains no kernelsof truth, but is part of a psychological operation to convince the Soviets thatpostwar Nazi scientists were in possession of advanced technologies, and byimplication, that their allied and neutral hosts were as well.There would seem to be some substance to both possibilities, and this brings usback to SS Colonel Otto Skorzeny, for as I and other researchers have pointedout, Skorzeny’s postwar headquarters, as for so many other Nazis, was Franco’sNationalist Spain, and in Skorzeny’s case, it was Spain’s capital, Madriditself.24 Skorzeny’s presence raises considerably the possibility that we aredealing at the minimum with a psychological warfare operation, one conceived andexecuted by the Nazis, and at the maximum, with a psychological warfareoperation conceived and executed by the Nazis in conjunction with certaintechnologies they brought with them to Spain and were perhaps researching andmanufacturing there. We have, in other words, clear indication that aSonderkampfwas being waged after the war, \"behind enemy lines.\"But did the Nazis in fact plan for postwar psychological operations inconjunction with their plans to form a \"Nazi International” extra-territorialstate?This is where the story becomes very intriguing!B. The Nazis’ Post-War Plan for Psyops There can be no doubt whatsoever that the Nazis not only had a \"come back” plan,but that this plan was intimately tied to their economic and \"strategicevacuation” plans and their schemes to form a postwar extra-territorial \"state,”a \"Nazi International”. Psychological warfare, or Weltanschauungskrieg becamethe actual military operations performed by this \"state”: > Captured Nazi documents reveal they had a comeback plan. Their plan to regain> power after the war revolved around using their friends and fascist> sympathizers in other countries—particularly in the United States— to do their> bidding while rebuilding Germany. The documents note that, as late as 1944,> the Nazis were hoping for a Republican victory in the presidential election> because they would get an easier peace. The second part of their plan aimed at> provoking a war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union which would allow the> Nazis to retake power in Germany without U.S. intervention.25Part of the matrix in which the Nazis hoped to accomplish this campaign isrevealed by the detailed connections between postwar German and Nazi leaders onthe one hand, and high-ranking members of American society and government on theother.For example, John J. McCloy, the pre-war American attorney for I.G. Farben, andwho had once shared Hitler’s box during the Berlin Olympics, and postwarAmerican High Commissioner for Germany (and, let it be noted, subsequently amember of the Warren Commission on the assassination of President John F.Kennedy), was brother-in-law to American General Draper, and the first WestGerman Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, for all three men had married daughters ofJohn Zinsser, a partner in the JP Morgan interests!26Similar connections were forged between Hjalmar Schacht, Hitler’s one-timeReichsbank president, and Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. And ofcourse, the notorious Bilderberger meetings themselves were the brainchildren ofDavid and Laurence Rockefeller and the London Rothschilds on the one hand, andNazi SS officer former I.G. Farben manager Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands,with early meetings in the 1950s featuring the regular presence of Dr. HermanJosef Abs, head of Deutschebank and at one time, the banker who actually paidHitler’s salary. And of course, let it be remembered that Colonel Skorzeny hadmarried Hjalmar Schacht’s daughter.27 As we shall see in the next section of thebook, this is but the tip of a very large American-Nazi iceberg.However it is precisely the existence of such networks and personal connectionsthat the Nazis were counting on, as is revealed by their documents outlining thelong range plan for extended Weltanschauungskrieg. For example, in a 1944edition of the French version of the German magaszineCombat (Angriff), a Germanpropaganda sheet designed to win the French over to the Nazi cause, an articleby German General Von Stulpnagel admitted not only that the current war waslost, but outlined the long range objective of an extended psy-op: > In the next war, which should take place within 25 years, the same mistake> must not be made. The principal adversary will be the United States, and the> entire effort must be concentrated against this country from the beginning…> Our defeat in the present war need not be considered except as an incident in> the triumphant march of Germany towards the conquest of the world, and from> now on we must give a defeated Germany the spirit of a future conqueror. What> does a temporary defeat matter if, through the destruction of people and> material wealth in enemy countries, we are able to secure a margin of economic> and demographic superiority even greater than before 1939? If we can succeed> in doing this, this war will have been useful, since it will enable us, within> the next 25 years, to wage another war under better conditions… Our enemies> will grow weary before we do. We shall have to organize a campaign of pity> designed to induce them to send us needed supplies at the earliest possible> moment. Above all we must hold on to the assets we have deposited in neutral> countries. The present war will thus have been a march forward towards our> supremacy. We have not to fear conditions of peace analogous to those we have> imposed, because our adversaries will always be divided and disunited.28But Von Stulpnagel was being evasive, though clearly hinting at (West) Germany’spostwar \"Blackmail” diplomacy,29 i.e., the diplomacy whereby (West) Germanythreatened that it would be absorbed into the Communist bloc if not allowed tore-industrialize and re-arm.This \"Blackmail” diplomacy was conceived during the end of WW2, even as Bormannwas formulating his economic \"strategic evacuation” plans. A document fromAdmiral Canaris’ Abwehrabteilung dated March 15, 1944, and classified GeheimeReichssache (Secret State Matter), calls upon strong psychological warfaremeasures \"to the fullest extent possible” and utilizing \"all availablepossibilities in neutral and enemy countries in order to support our militaryefforts with political and propaganda campaigns” with the goal to eventuallythwart the Allies, whose goal \"it is to destroy forever the German Reichmilitarily, economically and culturally.”30The handwriting was, however, on the wall, as I have noted elsewhere, in early1943, after the German defeat at Stalingrad.31 It was during this period thatthe first strategic evacuation plans were first being formed, and as well, thatthe first plans for postwar psychological operations were also being formed: > On July 27, 1943,32 the German Foreign Office expert on the U.S., the> geopolitician Colin Ross, suggested in a 15-page memorandum a \"Plan for an> Ideological Campaign in the United States.”> Recognizing Germany’s inability to bring the war to a victorious end, Ross> proposed the immediate implementation of carefully planned psychological> warfare to undermine the anticipated U.S. military victory. Ross regarded> American public opinion as the weakest link because the American people seemed> especially susceptible to scare propaganda hinting that a defeated Germany> would join the ranks of Bolshevism. The memorandum, which was addressed to the> German Secretary of State in the Foreign Office, von Steengracht, became the> guidepost for Germany’s highly successful blackmail diplomacy in post-war> America. Here follow some significant parts of the memorandum.> > PLAN FOR AN IDEOLOGICAL CAMPAIGN IN THE UNITED STATES> The prerequisites for psychological warfare:> 1. Analyze the spiritual temper of world public opinion.> 2. Evaluate correctly the ideological weapons available.> 3. Put before the eyes of the world a strategic concept which will impress not> only our own people, but also the neutrals and our enemies.> 4. Select the most effective tactical methods for the accomplishment of the> above.> 5. Co-ordinate the ideological campaign in support of our military and> economic warfare.> The more the prospects for outright military victory diminish, the more urgent> becomes the necessity for all-out psychological warfare….> …Therefore, it is necessary to set up a far-flung organization in every> country which, under enemy occupation, must carry on the task from the> underground. We must do everything possible to impress upon American public> opinion that after the liberation of Europe they will become involved in an> endless maze of insoluble contradictions.33Note that this document explicitly states that Nazism would have to gounderground, and create a vast international network—requiring perforce a vastwarchest—to conduct such an all-out Weltanschauungskrieg. Note also that part ofthis operation involved the use of the technique of polarization, i.e., ofcreating mutually contradictory sets or contexts of interpretation by which theAmerican public opinion was to be paralyzed.The U.S. Department of State was not oblivious to these plans, for on March 30,1945, it published a document indicating that the U.S.A. was aware of bothaspects—the economic and psychological warfare components—of the postwar plan: > Nazi Party members, German industrialists, and the German military, realizing> that victory can no longer be attained, are now developing post-war commercial> projects, are endeavoring to renew and cement friendships in foreign> commercial circles and are planning for renewals of pre-war cartel agreements.> An appeal to the courts of various countries will be made early in the> post-war period through dummies for \"unlawful” seizure of industrial plants> and other properties taken over by Allied governments at the outbreak of war.> In cases where this method fails German repurchase will be attempted through> \"cloaks” who meet the necessary citizenship requirements…> …German capital and plans for the construction of ultra-modern technical> schools and research laboratories will be offered at extremely favorable terms> since they will afford the Germans an excellent opportunity to design and> perfect new weapons. This Government is now in possession of photostatic> copies of several volumes of German plans on this subject. The German> propaganda program is to be an integral part of the over-all post-war> program.34Note the very significant point that part of this plan revolves uponre-establishing the corporate and personal relationships that existed prior tothe war between Germany, and Nazism on the one hand, and American corporateelites on the other.In other words, the Nazis were counting on the American components of thosepre-war relationships to wage the Weltanschauungskrieg for and with them to someextent.Before we can examine the American and Nazi components of this postwarWeltanschuungskrieg, however, we must turn to that aspect of it that couples thedisplay of technology with its magical interpretation…image [images/00021.jpg] Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, Head of Germany’s Abwehrabteilung, or MilitaryIntelligence 1 Stephen Williams, “The Black Knight SatelliteRevisited,”http://paranormal-mysteries.co.uk/?p=630[http://paranormal-mysteries.co.uk/?p=630]2 Igor Witwkoski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 231.3 Ibid.4 Joseph P.

In this chapter, we will review his work with apurpose to extract those principles indicative of the use of psychologicaloperations and to detect, if possible, the ideology motivating the breakawaycivilization. Indeed, Vallee hints at some of this vast potential for socialengineering near the beginning of his book Messengers of Deception: > Visitors from outer space would be a convenient interlude. They would offer> the space effort—and all its attendant industrial technology—a new purpose in> life. They would rescue Western civilization from its acute spiritual malaise.> They would help transcend political emotions and pave the way to the> unification of that enormous economic marketplace: Planet Earth. Take these> possibilities into consideration, and you will begin to understand why the> idea of life in space is no longer a simple scientific speculation but a> social and political issue as well. Sensing this, the military authorities> have tried to stay away from it as long as possible. So has the scientific> community.3But we have already established that two prominent Nazi scientists—Oberth andVon Braun—spoke out in provocative terms about the “extraterrestrial presence”in the postwar period when it is clear that a case can be made that some of theadvanced “flying saucer” technology that UFOs represented already existed inNazi Germany. Moreover, we have pointed out that Dr. Oberth was clearly involvedin the Bell project.In short, in the Nazis’ case at least, these scientists were lying, and lying itwould appear to a purpose, the purpose being to promote the idea ofextraterrestrial life—and to imply an extraterrestrial threat—whilesimultaneously protecting advanced technology by managing the public perceptionof it. This is a classic Sonderkampf of a Weltanschauungskrieg.Moreover, as we shall discover in the next section of this book, the postwarNazis are working hand-in-hand with the American corporate elite after the war,which elite helped place the Nazis into power before the war. As we discoveredin the previous chapter, the postwar Nazi scheme to survive and eventuallyregain power focused precisely on re-forging these relationships. As mostreaders of this book are probably aware, one of the consistent goals of thisAnglo-American corporate and banking elite has been to forge a global new worldorder, a global corporate fascist state, and thus, this elite would have strongincentive to pursue, or acquiesce in, such a Weltanschauungskrieg itself.Moreover, as we observed in the previous chapter, this elite had alreadyestablished funding of psychological warfare studies in the United Statesthrough the mechanisms of the Ford, Carnegie, and Rockefeller foundations, andthus, had access to all the techniques that research discovered.Vallee, in pondering similar questions, comes to a somewhat startlingconclusion, namely, that from the standpoint of social engineering, > it doesn’t matter any more whether flying saucers are real or not. It still> matters to me, of course, as an individual scientist. I have often stated, and> I still believe today, that UFOs are real and technological. When I say it> doesn’t matter whether they are real or not, I am speaking of their social> impact.> You can find scholars whole will “prove” to you that the supernatural powers> of Jesus Christ never existed. You can also find scholars who will “prove” to> you that they did exist. Does it matter? Of course not! It only matters to the> experts, who have staked their academic reputations on either side of the> argument. The effects of the belief in Jesus, the impact of the doctrine based> on the story of his life and death, are real enough. Socially, historically,> the consequences are beyond question. I claim that the same now applies to> flying saucers because enough people believe in them, enough people believe> that contact with them is possible, and enough people even believe that they> have secretly achieved such contact.4Note the resemblance, in terms of the alchemical architecture of socialengineering, between UFOs and religion, a parallelism we have alreadyencountered with George Adamski and the other early contactees. Indeed, the factthat the later alleged Nazi “field propulsion saucers” of the Hannebu type soclosely resemble Adamski’s, and the fact that there are clear parallels betweenAdamski’s “messages from ET” and Nazi doctrine, indicates the profoundpossibility that the whole Adamski affair was one large psychological operation,a possibility that increases dramatically when one recalls that Adamski’sinitial contacts were from the American military.In short, what UFOs represent from the social engineering standpoint is a“veritable mass conversion” of “the public and media elite,”5 for “thephenomenon serves as a vehicle for images that can be manipulated to promotebelief systems tending to the long-term transformation of human society.”6 Toput it succinctly, UFOs represent, for the psychological warfare specialist, analchemical technology to transmute mankind himself into a philosophers’ stone.A. UFOs and the Social Engineering of a New Religion We noted in chapter two the close resemblance of Adamski’s alleged “messages”from extraterrestrials to the components of religion: an expectation ofrevelation, a “magisterium” appointed to deliver the message, and an implicittechnological threat of impending apocalyptic judgment if humanity did not mendits ways and acquiesce to ET’s “advice.”But according to Dr. Vallee, there is more to this parallel to religion thanmeets the eye, for the specific parallels between the UFO phenomenon andreligion and myth are quite detailed, suggesting, again, that the phenomenon isbeing manipulated precisely for the purpose of a transformation of the humanpsyche, both individual and social; it is being manipulated as a conditioningprocess: > The most clear result was that the phenomenon behaved like a conditioning> process. The logic of conditioning uses absurdity and confusion to achieve its> goal, while hiding its mechanism. There is a similar structure in the UFO> stories.> I am beginning to perceive a coherent picture of the “flying saucer”> phenomenon for the first time, now that I am pursuing the idea that UFOs may> be a control system, and now that I am aware of their link to human> consciousness. I still think there is a genuine technology at work here,> causing the effects witnesses are describing. But I am not ready to jump to> the conclusion that it is the technology of some kind of “spacemen.”7It is worth pausing to consider the implications of these remarks in somedetail.Notably, Vallee is alluding to the technique of polarization, of the deliberateobfuscation of data by the creation of two mutually opposed contexts by which toperceive and interpret it, thus conditioning a population. In this case, it isworth considering the stories of ET-human contact in toto. As we saw withAdamski and the early contactees, the “ETs” were essentially human, and thecontacts themselves—notwithstanding the darker implications of their“message”—were fairly benign. But during the 1970s and 1980s, the ETs hadmorphed into robotic “grays” and reptilians, kidnapping their hapless victims,and subjecting them to a variety of invasive procedures that can only bedescribed, from the human point of view, as a form of physical if notpsychological torture. In both cases, however, a subtle “meme” is shared,namely, that humanity is helpless, its technology outclassed, and it must submitto the guidance of an elite. In the case of the later abduction stories, it iseven said on many occasions that the behavior of the “ETs” is not quiterationalizable from a human perspective, and ipso facto, their intellect andmoral understanding must be as superior to us as we to the animals. In any case,the meme remains the same. But throughout both types of contact it is importantto recall that polarization itself is a purely human technique of psychologicaloperations.Vallee states this point about the aggregate effect over time of UFO contactstories with his customary directness: > The social, political, and religious consequences of the experience are> enormous if they are considered, not in the days or weeks following the> sighting, but over the time span of a generation. Could it be that such> effects are actually intended, through some process of social conditioning?> Could it be that both the believers and the skeptics are being manipulated? Is> the public being deceived and led to false conclusions by someone who is using> the UFO witnesses to propagate revolutionary new ideas?8A little further on, Vallee answers these questions in no uncertain terms: > I believe there is a machinery of mass manipulation behind the UFO phenomenon.> It aims at social and political goals by diverting attention from some human> problems and by providing a potential release for tensions caused by others.> The contactees are a part of that machinery. They are helping to create a new> form of belief: an expectation of actual contact among large parts of the> public. In turn this expectation makes millions of people hope for the> imminent realization of that age-old dream: salvation from above, surrender to> the greater power of some wise navigators of the cosmos.> With the release of popular UFO movies, many people who previously were> skeptics have begun to jump on this bandwagon from outer space.

However, if you take the trouble to join me in the analysis of the> modern UFO myths, you will see that human beings under the control of of a> strange force that is bending them in absurd ways, forcing them to play in a> bizarre game of deception. This role may be very important if changing social> conditions make it desirable to focus the attention of the public on the> distant stars while obsolete human institutions are wiped out and rebuilt in> new ways. Are the manipulators, in the final analysis, nothing more than a> group of humans who have mastered a very advanced form of power?> Let me summarize my conclusions thus far. UFOs are real. They are physical> devices used to affect human consciousness. They may not be from outer space.> Their purpose may be to achieve social changes on this planet, through a> belief system that uses systematic manipulation of witnesses and contactees;> covert use of various sects and cults; control of the channels through which> the alleged “space messages” can make an impact on the public.9With these conclusions I wholeheartedly concur, for throughout my books on Nazisecret weapons, I have been at pains to show the terrestrial origins of thefantastic technology represented by their Bell project, at pains to “reverseengineer” the possible physics basis for it, and to show that they survived thewar in a position secure and strong enough to continue that researchindependently of the victories Allied powers. In short, the ET hypothesis issimply not necessary as an interpretive template by which to rationalize Naziachievements.As I showed in the previous chapter, the Nazis before the war’s end conceivedand planned a vast psychological operation, a tactical Sonderkampf of a longrange strategic Weltanschauungskrieg designed to restore Nazism to power, if thetestimony of Otto Skorzeny is to be believed. I have also shown that, given Dr.Oberth’s presence on the Bell project itself, his pronouncements regarding theextraterrestrial origins of UFOs should be greeted with some skepticism. Thesepsychological operations, moreover, were conceived within the context of a wideroperation to restore pre-war links between Nazism and the Anglo-Americancorporate and banking elite, an elite which, as we saw, itself privately fundedmuch war-time psychological warfare research. Vallee’s remarks thus testify toyet another aspect of this stratagem, and also strongly suggest that there is abelief system being put into play, a belief system we saw first enunciated withGeorge Adamski, to whom we shall return in a moment.For Vallee, the consequences of this social engineering, if left unchecked, arenothing less than global: “To let UFO speculation grow unchecked would only makethe public an easy and defenseless prey to charlatans of all kind. It would meanthat any organized group bent upon the destruction of our society couldundermine it by skillful use of the saucer mythology…”10But what exactly constitutes this mythology, this religion? What are its corebeliefs or doctrines?1. The Resemblance to Myths In chapter two, I pointed out the parallel between Adamskian-type contacteemythos, and that of western religion itself. Vallee compiles a useful catalogueof contactee beliefs: > A catalogue of contactee themes, compiled from interviews I have conducted,> includes the following:> Intellectual abdication. The widespread belief that human beings are incapable> of solving their own problems, and that extraterrestrial intervention is> imperative to save us “in spite of ourselves.” The danger in such a philosophy> is that it makes its believers dependent on outside forces and discourages> personal responsibility: why should we worry about the problems around us, if> the Gods from Outer Space are about to solve them?> Racist philosophy. The pernicious suggestion that some of us on the Earth are> of extraterrestrial descent and therefore constitute a “higher race.” The> dangers inherent in this belief should be obvious to anybody who hasn’t> forgotten the genocides of World War II, executed on the premise that some> races were somehow “purer” or better than others. (Let us note in passing that> Adamski’s Venusian, the Stranger of the Canigou seen by Bordar, and many other> alleged extraterrestrials were all tall Aryan types with long blond hair.)> Technical Impotence. The statement that the birth of civilization on this> planet resulted not from the genius and ability of mankind, but from repeated> assistance by higher beings. Archaeologists and anthropologists are constantly> aware of the marvelous skill which the “Ancient Engineers” (to use L. Sprague> de Camp’s phrase) developed the tolls of civilization on all continents. No> appeal to superior powers is necessary to explain the achievements of early> culture. The belief expressed by the contactees reveals a tragic lack of trust> on their part in human ability.> Social utopia. Fantastic economic theories, including the belief that a “world> economy” can be created overnight, and that democracy should be abolished in> favor of Utopian systems, usually dictatorial in their outlook.11Note that the themes of dictatorship, racial and technical superiority, and anoff-planet origin for humanity from higher beings, and a social utopia, wouldall be memes or ideas well in keeping with the ideology both of Nazism, and, aswe shall see in the next section, within certain circles of the Americancorporate and banking elite, particularly those represented by the Ford andRockefeller dynasties.To these we may add the memes we discovered operative in Adamski’s case: > 1) The meme of immanent revelation, or “disclosure;”> 2) The meme of “conversion,” i.e., the claim of some to have had a special> “Damascus road” revelation, ala St. Paul, with extra-terrestrials, and thus to> constitute themselves part of a magisterium of illumination and truth, whose> statements are to be taken on faith in the authority of their personal> experience, as opposed to the “outside world” of skepticism and non-belief.The last point cannot be pondered too long, for it is the standard technique of“the Three Great Yahwisms” or the three great monotheisms, which came, by claimsof special revelation coupled with the “judicious application of force andterror”—in other words, by dint of a psychological warfare operation—to supplantthe older philosophia perrenis of the cultures around them. In short, the ThreeGreat Yahwisms produced the same precise results of these later contacteerevelations: > 1) A social schism between “truth” and “error” or “believer and infidel” or,> in the case of contactees, believers and skeptics;> 2) The requirement of a revelation to enforce the status of the former; and> therefore,> 3) An incipient introduction of unending conflict between the two groups;12> and thus,> 4) The fulfillment of a utopian or messianic expectation sometime in the> future.13Vallee is alive to the fact that there are parallels between religion in theproper sense, and contactee-ism, for in his view, the Mormon religion would betoday viewed precisely as a contactee phenomenon.14 Succinctly stated, a mere“physics” approach to the UFO phenomenon is inadequate, for the phenomenonencompasses wider aspects of social, alchemical transformation.15On only one point would I perhaps disagree with Vallee, and that is that theancient belief in a connection between humanity and extraterrestrials neednecessarily represent a connection with something inhuman, for as I have arguedin other books, the possibility exists that we have “genetic cousins” of thegenus homo out there, with whom we might be biologically connected.16In any case, it is worth noting that what was yesterday’s“contactee-counter-culture” is today’s mainstream speculation as evidenced by arecently published NASA-sponsored academic paper entitled “Would Contact withExtraterrestrials Benefit or Harm Humanity?”17 Papers such as this, plus thestatements of prominent military or political leaders should be viewed againstthe backdrop of the existing psychological warfare operations, for they tend tolegitimize the memes implanted in those operations, plus sow an element ofconfusion and doubt by fueling speculations that “the government knows more thanit is telling.”So persistent are the memes of the contactee-abduction faith that it bearslittle distinction from the “elves, sylphs, and lutins of the Middle Ages.”18Indeed, as Vallee notes, the details of abductions are consistent, not merelyacross several stories, but across the centuries, as in the famous case of BettyHill, who was examined by “extraterrestrials” who inserted a long needle intoher abdomen, a detail, he observes, is also found on a fifteenth century Frenchcalendar, the Kalendrier des Bergiers, which depicts demons “piercing theirvictims’ abdomens with long needles.”19 This “continuum of belief” spans thewhole period “from primitive magic, through mystical experience, thefairy-faith, and religion, to modern flying saucers”20 to such an extent thateven the ancient idea of chimerical offspring of humans and ETs is reproduced.21Again, the persistence of these themes, particularly in Nazism, stronglysuggests that their recurrence in the context of the advanced technologyrepresented by UFOs might be a component of Skorzeny’s Sonderkampf which heconceived to operate “behind enemy lines” in conjunction with advancedtechnology.2. The Three Effects of UFOs Thus, according to Vallee, there are three components to the UFO phenomenon,each of them fitting, as we have suggested, the component features of aSonderkampf, of a Weltanschauungskrieg:> The first aspect is physical. The UFO behaves like a region of space, of small> dimensions (about 10 meters), within which a very large amount of energy is> stored. This energy is manifested by pulsed light phenomena of intense colors,> by other forms of electromagnetic radiation, and by microwaves that create> distortions of the witnesses’ sense of reality.> The second aspect is psychological. It is debatable whether anybody has seen> the actual technology that supports the phenomenon. What is seen, and> reported, is an image; that is, the perception of a UFO by a human witness.> Reports of UFOs show all kinds of psychophysiological effects on the> witnesses: perception distortions, unconscious barriers, and mental blocks.> Witnesses also show evidence of suggestion and posthypnotic effects. Exposure> to the phenomenon causes visions, hallucinations, physiological effects, and> long-term personality changes.> The third aspect is social. Belief in the reality of UFOs is spreading rapidly> at all levels of society throughout the world.22I suggest that the SS, of which Skorzeny was an officer—by its investigations ofmind control techniques, by its ideological commitments to the idea of a “masterrace”, by its study of occult manuscripts detailing mediaeval accounts ofabductions and invasive procedures, by the belief in some of its quarters withan extraterrestrial link23—was in the perfect position to appreciate thesignificance of the technology it possessed for its ability to unite each ofthese three components in a psychological operation.But is there a stronger case that can be made to connect psychologicaloperations, UFO contactees, and Nazism? Indeed there is, and once again, it isDr. Vallee who makes it.3. The Nazi Connection:The Fascist Overtones of Adamski’s Contactee Messages Vallee begins by asking a logical question: if, as he suggests, there is acontrolling intelligence manipulating the UFO phenomenon for its social impact,a group he calls The Manipulators”, then could the goal be massive deception? > I have given this name to the hypothetical agents who might cause the UFO> contacts and engineer their effects. Everything now centers on their role,> their identity, their designs. Who could they be? Alien beings coming from the> end of the galaxy? Psychic entities from the “other side”? Automata controlled> by some nonhuman consciousness? Holographic nightmares? But perhaps we are> looking far away for something which is right under our nose: could they> simply be human? Could they be masters of deception so skillful that they plan> to counterfeit an invasion from space?24Vallee contacted one of his sources within the American military, a MajorMurphy, who then repeated, almost to the exact detail, the components of theNazi flying saucer mythos!: > “In 1943,” he said, as we sat in his study, “we already had evidence that> several countries were working on circular aircraft that they hoped to develop> into secret weapons. The Germans were also doing advanced research on> controlled electrical discharges and ‘controlled lightning,’ and tried to> combine these things together.25(Recall that in my rationalization of the physics behind the Bell device, thatstrong high voltage impulses—essentially controlled lightning—were used in thedevice.]26 > When we invaded Germany, a lot of hardware fell into our hands, but the> Russians had gotten most of the good stuff. Then people started seeing the> modern UFOs in Sweden in 1946.> …> “And what does that have to do with UFOs or with rockets, or secret weapons? I> asked rather brusquely.> He took my outburst with patience. “On the surface, if you just look at a few> isolated cases, like scientists arguing about UFOs, well, I agree it doesn’t> mean anything. But suppose somebody had obtained a device by the end of the> war, which perhaps wasn’t a very effective weapon. Perhaps it couldn’t fly> very effectively, couldn’t carry guns and bombs, but had other properties. For> instance, it could emit radiation that caused paralysis and hallucinations as> it flew over an area, so that witnesses exposed to it would think they saw the> phantasms of their own imagination. Did somebody test that kind of a device in> Sweden in 1946, and in the States in 1947, and find it to be ineffective as a> flying machine, but very useful as a means of propaganda? Has such a group> already understood what UFOs were, and are they confusing the issue by> simulating UFO waves? Or is the entire phenomenon under their control?27Note that the Bell, still in the mid-to-late 1940s in a prototypical stage ofdevelopment, would well fit the requirements of a technology that was not yetperfected as a flying machine or a weapon.The conversation then quickly comes directly to the point, and the point is theNazi possibility, as “Major Murphy” then continues: > You need to face all the possibilities. You have to draw the consequences.> Someone may have solved the (UFO) problem. perhaps there is an elegant> solution to multidimensional travel, and it is being applied. I am not a> physicist. You should ask your theoretician friends what they think. I can> only tell you that silent, disk-shaped flying machines can be built. If they> are equipped with the right devices, they can create astonishing effects and> be reported as flying saucers. I wish I still had my files on the German> experiments.> Suppositions, I thought. Assumptions. We’re going to need more than that to> explain the UFO problem. “Major, I can’t believe that some Nazi group had> managed to survive secretly with this kind of technology in its power.”28But Vallee himself subsequently presents precisely the prospect of a hiddeninternational group doing precisely that!: > The institutions created to carry them out are still in existence, with their> privileged communications channels, their hidden sources of procurement and> capital, their recruiting procedures. The answer to the question, “Could such> an international group fake, use, or manipulate UFO activity?” has to be YES.> The argument that such a secret could not be kept very long is not tenable.29Ponder this conclusion carefully, for as I have consistently argued in previousbooks and presented evidence here, the Nazis not only survived the war as anintact extraterritorial state,30 but they did so with enough capitalization andorganization to continue advanced postwar research projects,31 and, if Skorzenyis to be believed, with a plan for psychological operations in conjunction withthat technology.It is in this connection that Adamski’s Fascist and Nazi connections should beviewed, for they raise considerably the possibility that the whole affair was apsychological warfare operation of some sort: > According to some of my own informants, contactee George Adamksi had prewar> connections with American fascist leader William Dudley Pelley, who was> interned during the war. Another seminal contactee, George Hunt Williamson> (whose real name is Michel d’Obrenovic), was associated with Pelley’s> organization “Soulcraft,” in the early fifties. In fact, Pelley may have put> Williamson in touch with Adamski. other associates of Williamson during the> great era of the flying saucers were such contactees as John McCoy and the two> Stanford brothers, Ray and Rex.> The connections between all these men, who have been influential in shaping> the UFO myth in the United States, are quite intricate. William Dudley Pelley,> who died in 1965, was the leader of the Silver Shirts, an American Nazi group> which began its activities about 1932. Its membership overlapped strongly with> Guy Ballard’s “I Am” movement. Pelley declined to join the other fascist> groups in their support for Congressman Lemke in 1936, standing on his own in> Indiana as a “Christian Party” candidate. His opposition to Roosevelt> increased until his eight-year internment for sedition in 1942. After the war,> he started an occult group, Soulcraft, and published a racist magazine called> Valor. He also wrote the book Star Guests in 1950, a compilation of automatic> writing reminiscent of the Seth Material. 32Such Fascist links go a long way to explaining why in so manyabduction-contactee circles that there is such a heavy emphasis “on theexistence of ‘superior races,’33 of people with chosen missions, theirreferences to Atlantis and ancient astronauts,”34 and powerful symbols andsocial images of “universal peace, the exploration of space,” and “a singleworld economy.”35But there is, as I suggested in the previous chapter, an American component tothis global psychological warfare game as well, and Vallee is quite alive to it: > My guess is that someone deep within the U.S. government structure is using> the stories of crashed saucers to hide something else. The Pentagon is clearly> in possession of the world’s most extensive collection of UFO photographs and> films, electromagnetic recordings, and radar reports. But data is not> information. At some point the public relations arm of the Air Force was> tasked with the deliberate spreading of confusion and disinformation about> UFOs. It used its own officers and its public relations agencies… to spread> the rumors, making a deliberate effort to enlist the UFO amateur groups in> support of various forgeries… They used their assets in Hollywood and in the> publishing world to initiate the rumor that the United States had recovered> crashed saucers. My ufologist friends should awaken to the fact that in one> way or the other all the stories they are happily spreading about MJ-12 and> the aliens originate with the Pentagon itself, a clear indication that they> may have been planted in the first place.36But that is not the only possibility that Vallee sees as emanating from theAmerican side: > Or there could be a deeply buried renegade group of believers with extreme> political and religious beliefs within the American intelligence community> itself, piggybacking on classified channels to spread disinformation in> support of their own peculiar goals. This hypothesis is not as farfetched as> it might appear. In the last two decades federal investigators have uncovered> and prosecuted several infiltration groups linked to various cults such as> Reverend Moon’s sect, Scientology, or the shadowy LaRouche organization. In> any case, we must realize that those who claim to expose a cover-up may be the> very tools of that cover-up, and we must look for the truth in a different> direction.37And one of those directions must surely be the fact that U.S. intelligence, inthe wake of the “bargain” struck between OSS Station chief in Zurich, and laterCIA director Allen Dulles, and the then-head of Nazi military intelligence inthe East, General Reinhard Gehlen, resulted in a large segment of the CIA beingthe home to precisely such a rogue group, with precisely such extremeideological beliefs.The end result of these psychological and social engineering operations are, forVallee, full of dire portent, for “They also suggest that our civilization maybe headed for very serious trouble, with irrational forces tearing apart the oldstructures and replacing them by the blind institutions of inhuman beliefs.”38Indeed, Vallee notes that the “potential discovery of extraterrestrial life”, oreven the manufactured appearance of it, > …Would help in transcending local conflicts and in achieving within a single> generation behavioral changes that might otherwise take a hundred years to> complete. If this is in fact the contribution of the UFO phenomenon, then we> are in fact dealing with one of history’s major transitions.39And this, is, in fact, the goal of psychological warfare, namely to achieve avictory over an enemy without firing a single shot.4. The UFO as an Alchemical, Psychotronic Technology Before concluding this chapter, we must make final mention of something thatmust, to the attentive reader, by now become evident: much of the psychologicalwarfare operations that we suspect is performed in conjunction with UFOs is forthe purpose of social engineering, and thus, relies for its success by“carefully borrowing its concepts from basic human archetypes in order to forcea global behavioral change.”40 It goes without saying that the study ofpsychological archetypes was the cornerstone of Jungian analysis, and that CarlGustav Jung was, himself, a supporter of the Nazis. As such, for Vallee, UFOsrepresent a kind of alchemical psychotronic technology, i.e., a technologydesigned not only to act physically, but also upon human consciousness.41 Givenall the evidence and data presented thus far, all the conditions are there—fromthe study of psychological archetypes, to the occult doctrines ofextraterrestrial-human origins and descent, to the use of a prototypicaltechnology, to allow both the American and Nazi components of a postwarbreakaway civilization to conduct psychological warfare operations to promoteits distinctively different ideology and world order.It remains to be seen, in the final section of this book, if indeed the otherprerequisites for such a breakaway civilization can be met, but before we canturn to that, we must summarize the results of the first two sections.image [images/00022.jpg] Carl Gustav Jung, Founder of the Psychologcial Archetypes Theory of Analysisimage [images/00023.jpg] French Scientist and Ufologist Dr. Jacques Vallee 1 Jacques Vallee, Messengers of Deception: UFO Contacts and Cults (Daily GrailPublishing, 2008), p. 68.2 Ibid., p. 223.3 Jacques Vallee, Messengers of Deception: UFO Contacts and Cults (Daily GrailPublishing, 2008), p. 53.4 Vallee, Messengers of Deception, pp. 54-55, italicized emphasis in theoriginal, boldface emphasis added.5 Ibid., p. v.6 Ibid., p. vi.7 Vallee, Messengers of Deception, p. 7, emphasis added.8 Vallee, Messengers of Deception, p. 9. See also Vallee’s remarks in Passportto Magonia:“What does it all mean? Is it reasonable to draw a parallel between religiousapparitions, the fairy-faith, the reports of dwarf-like beings with supernaturalpowers, the airship tales in the United States in the last century, and thepresent stories of UFO landings?“I would strongly argue that it is—for one simple reason: the mechanisms thathave generated these various beliefs are identical. Their human context andtheir effect on humans are constant. And it is my conclusion that theobservation of this very deep mechanism is a crucial one. It has little to dowith the problem of knowing whether UFO’s are physical objects or not.Attempting to understand the meaning, the purpose of the so-called flyingsaucers, as many people are doing today, is just as futile as was the pursuit ofthe fairies, if one makes the mistake of confusing appearance and reality. Thephenomenon has stable, invariant features, some of which we have tried toidentify and label clearly. But we have also to note carefully thechameleon-like character of the secondary attributes of the sightings: theshapes of the objects, the appearances of their occupants, their reportedstatements, vary as a function of the cultural environment into which they areprojected.” (Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia, [Chicago: Contemporary Books,1993), pp. 148-149.Obviously, this would imply that the historical roots of such social engineeringpre-date the Nazis, but such would require a book on its own to exploreadequately, as the roots would be locked deep within esoteric societies and raremanuscripts. Here our focus remains on the modern manifestation of thephenomenon of the use of advanced technology for social engineering, representedby the Anglo-American elite and the Nazis.One aspect of this story, again beyond the pale of this book, is the fact thatthe social engineering aspects of the story change with the type of technologythat accompanies it: “The entire mystery we are discussing contains all theelements of a myth that could be utilized to serve political or sociologicalpurposes, a fact illustrated by the curious link between the contents of thereports themselves and the progress of human technology, from aerial ships todirigibles to ghost rockets to flying saucers—a link that has never received asatisfactory interpretation in a sociological framework.” (Vallee, Passport toMagonia, p. 162, emphasis added).9 Valley, Messengers of Deception, pp. 20-21, all emphases in the original.10 Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: On UFOs, Folklore, and Parallel Worlds(Chicago: Contemporary Books, 1993), p. 132.11 Vallee, Messengers of Deception, pp. 112-113.12 Vallee, Messengers of Deception, p. 8: Vallee notes that the “space messages”created a “counter-culture” within wider society.13 For a fuller exposition of the social engineering aspects of the Three GreatYahwisms, see my and co-author Scott D. de Hart’s Altars, Alchemy, and theApocalypse: A Grimoire of the Alchemical Agenda for the Transformation of Man(Feral House, in press), chapter two.14 Vallee, Messengers of Deceoption, pp. 12-13.15 Ibid., p. 27.16 See my The Cosmic War: Interplanetary Warfare, Modern Physics, and AncientTexts (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2007), pp. 139-203;Genes, Giants, Monsters,and Men (Feral House, 2011).17 Seth D.

Vallee’s comments occur within a widercontext which should be cited here, and its clear implications noted: “Yet in noway am I excluding the possibility that this controlling intelligence (behindthe UFO-fairie phenomenon) is human, and I shall elaborate on this idea in laterchapters. For this time being, let me simply state again my basic contention:the modern, global belief in flying saucers and their occupants is identical toan earlier belief in the fairy-faith. The entities described as the pilots ofthe craft are indistinguishable from the elves, sylphs, and lutins of the MiddleAges. Through the observations of unidentified flying objects, we are concernedwith an agency our ancestors knew well and regarded with terror: we are pryinginto the affairs of the Secret Commonwealth.”In other words, Vallee is implying several significant things: (1) that there isa breakaway or secret civilization, and that it is very old, (2) it has beenactive throughout history, employing a variety of social engineering techniquesin conjunction with the technologies and belief systems of a particular age, and(3) that the controlling intelligence behind this activity may be human. Andthat, of course, implies a hidden elite at work throughout human history toengineer mankind’s consciousness, a theme I have explored in some of my books(See. Babylon’s Banksters: The Alchemy of Deep Physics, High Finance and AncientReligion (Feral House, 2010), pp. 159-205; Genes, Giants, Monsters, and Men: TheSurviving Elites of the Cosmic War and Their Hidden Agenda [Feral House, 2011]:and, with Scott D. de Hart,The Grid of the Gods: The Aftermoth of the Cosmic Warand the Physics of the Pyramid Peoples [Adventures Unlimited Press, 2011]).19 Vallee, Passport to Magonia, p. 95.20 Ibid., p. 131.21 Ibid., p. 127.22 Vallee, Messengers of Deception, pp. 7-8.23 For the belief in the extraterrestrial link, see my The Philosophers’ Stone:Alchemy and the Secret Research for Exotic Matter (Feral House, 2009), pp.255-259.24 Vallee, Messengers of Deception, p. 166.25 Vallee, Messengers of Deception, p. 166.26 Joseph P.

Vallee connects the racist theme to, among others, JackParsons and the founding of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Yet another “meme”associated with UFOs and ETs is that of blood sacrifice, this time in the formof the famous animal mutilations also commonly reported in conjunction with UFOactivity (see Vallee, op. cit., pp. 202-203, for a connection even to humansacrifice.)34 Ibid., p. 5935 Ibid., p. 60.36 Vallee, Revelations: Alien Contact and Human Deception (Ballantine Books,1991), p. 91.37 Ibid., pp. 91-92.38 Ibid., p. 61.39 Vallee, Messengers of Deception, p. 61.40 Ibid., p. 33, see also p. 48.41 Ibid., p. 45."},{"pageContent":"7PATTERNS IN THE FOG AND MIRRORS: CONCLUSIONS TO PARTS ONE AND TWO “…Just because a message comes from heaven doesn’t mean it’s not stupid.” Dr.Jacques Vallee1Thus far the principal activity that the breakaway civilization has exhibitedhas been that of a large psychological warfare operation. But we must now placethis operation within the wider context of the requisites for a breakawaycivilization itself, to ascertain more precisely what the purposes of thepsychological warfare might be. We thus shall review here the requisites andactivities of the breakaway civilization before proceeding to outline in thenext section its structure, funding, and its other activities.We noted in chapter one that there were six initial points about thiscivilization as outlined by Richard M. Dolan: > 1) It has “loose connections at various points” to the open civilization(s) of> humanity;> 2) It possesses “great independence” from them;> 3) It is secret, that is to say, its structure, components, and activities are> largely hidden from the open civilizations of humanity; and finally and most> importantly,> 4) It holds a monopoly over certain scientific concepts and the technologies> that result from them; thus,> 5) It possesses a different, and perhaps even a radically different physics> than the standard models of “public consumption” physics, and thus, possesses> different principles of engineering and technology.> 6) A breakaway civilization, having monopolies over advanced technologies and> theoretical science, will likely employ that technology in covert activities;> 7) It will seek to cloak those activities, if discovered, behind stories and> fabrications of a different origin for the technologies, lest the knowledge> become accessible publicly, and end the monopoly of the breakaway> civilization.I believe enough evidence has been presented thus far to show that the breakawaycivilization has been engaging in a psychological operation with respect to atleast some UFO and contactee activity, and that this operation was likely bornin the closing days of World War Two and conceived by the Nazis in conjunctionwith the technologies represented by the Bell and similar projects, and thatthis operation was also taken over and controlled by the American component ofthe breakaway civilization after World War Two. But the concept ofWeltanschauungskrieg strongly suggests that elements of Nazi ideology formedcomponents of this operation, and indeed, as we have seen, the technology itselfwas conceived as an alchemical or “psychotronic” technology to effect a socialtransformation. Adamski’s contactee visitations have all the hallmarks ofaspects of this ideology, and moreover, Adamski’s associates were themselvesconnected to Fascism.Adamski’s contactee stories also planted the memes of UFOlogy for the firsttime, which memes have remained well-embedded within the field since that time,notwithstanding the fact that most UFOlogy now shies away from Adamski’s claims.These memes may be viewed as a kind of “UFO Yahwism,” complete with its ownmagisterium of “experiencers” who, like St. Paul, have had a “Damascus roadexperience,” but this time with extraterrestrials, and who, due to thatexperience, can claim the status of prophet or apostle to some extent.Additionally, this “meme” also carries with it two assumptions also implicitwithin Yahwism, namely, a “social schism” between believers and infidels (orskeptics), and a belief in a future apocalyptic revelation or “disclosure,”which, it is to be noted, is brought to pass by the possessors and wielders ofthe technology itself, be they ET or humans. Given the Fascist overtones ofAdamski’s contactee story, this should give one pause.The rise of the Nazi UFO mythos at approximately the same time as the allegedAdamski contactes is, in our opinion, not accidental, but rather, both aspectsform components of one operation, in that both emerge with the appearance ofcoordinated efforts after the “historical gap” from the end of the war to theemergence of the mythos. We must also factor into this context the disclosure ofDr. Ronald Richter’s “fusion” project in Argentina during the same period,2 plusthe fact that in the case of the Paperclip Nazis’ pronouncements on theextraterrestrial origin of UFOs, at least Dr. Herman Oberth was lying, given hisconnection to the Bell project.But as we saw in chapter one, according to Dr. Quigley, there are three otherrequisites for a civilization: > 1) A civilization must be so organized as to invent new things or techniques> of doing things.> 2) A civilization must possess a means of the accumulation of surplus. For our> purposes, this will mean that we must look for mechanisms or, as Quigley calls> them, “instruments” of funding for such inventions that are relatively stable> and secure, but, by the nature of the case, that are also relatively secret;> 3) Any civilization, including a breakaway civilization, must also be> organized so that accumulated surplus is used to pay for, or utilize, the> invented technologies or techniques.These requirements occur within a matrix involving six levels: > 1) military,> 2) political,> 3) economic,> 4) social,> 5) religious, or as we shall see in this book, ideological,> 6) intellectualViewed in this fashion, it is clear that the psychological operation outlined inthis section evidences the operation of a group—a civilization—at the military,religious (Adamski) and intellectual (Nazism and its doctrines), level.We must now examine in the next section whether or not evidence exists for ahidden group or groups to fulfill the conditions of (1) invention, (2)accumulation of surplus, and (3) expenditure of the surplus on black projects,including psychological warfare operations.Here again, Quigley becomes crucial to point the way, for as noted in chapterone, other hallmarks of civilization include the following things: > 1) the ability to collect taxes, or tribute;> 2) a military that is subject to the “government” of the civilization;> 3) the ability to compartmentalize functions of government.Here it is well worth recalling that Quigley distinguished clearly betweenparasitic and producing civilizations. As we shall now discover in the nextsection, the breakaway civilization is a mixture of both types, and as we shallalso discover, it has yet two other factions besides the Nazi faction, for thereis a strong Anglo- American corporate elite faction, and also a stronginternational criminal syndicate… 1 Vallee, Messengers of Deception, p. 57.2 Joseph P.

Intervention in the war must be avoided at all costs. GeneralWood was chairman of Sears Roebuck, whose president, Donald Nelson, was head ofthe War Production Board.\" Charles Higham1By any standard of analysis, the Third Reich was a breakaway society; it hadbeen mid-wifed into existence by a variety of secret societies with ideologicalbeliefs at variance with, and even counter to the Western Civilization thatsurrounded it, and the Nazis pursed these beliefs at the point of a gun. Itconducted psychological operations—Weltanschauungskrieg—with all the componentsthereof, including terrorism—against its own people in an effort to convert themass consciousness into compliant servants of those doctrines. It fulfilled onecomplex requirement of a breakaway civilization by its very existence, for itwas both a productive, and parasitic, society.And the Nazi Reich- along with its American opponent overseas—had invented yetanother crucial component of the breakaway civilization, for like America, ithad created vast and secret bureaucracies, with their own infrastructuresindependent of the state itself to conduct secret research into advancedtechnologies, and to bring those technologies into existence. Indeed, ReichArmamants Minister (Reichrüstungsminister) Albert Speer complained of thecreation of this vast and hidden “state within a state” in a book published justa few years prior to his death: > In the spring of 1944 Hitler approved of Himmler’s proposal to build an> SS-owned industrial concern in order to make the SS permanently independent of> the state budget….. (Hitler) wanted to secure a position for the SS that would> keep it independent of the state and the Party. In case a successor should try> to use the state budget as an instrument to curtail the power of the SS and> Gestapo, Hitler wanted to create a financial source to provide the SS with its> own budget.2In other words, Hitler wanted to create a black budget, doubtless in an effortto mask the vast secret weapons research being conducted within Himmler’s SS,and in coordination with the slave labor available in the concentration camps.Of course, by the time Hitler gave his formal approval to this, the process hadalready been underway for a number of years.Nonetheless, this creation of a “state within the state” highlights crucialstructural components of the breakaway civilization that we will discover beingduplicated after the war: > 1) A nexus between intelligence agencies, in this case the SS’s vast array of> security agencies: theReichsicherheithauptamt, (RSHA) the Sicherheitdienst> (SD), the Gestapo, and so on, and the corporations conducting the actual> research and production. Here one need only think of how these relationships> are encapsulated at Auschwitz, where I.G. Farben maintained an enormous> production facility, in direct liaison with the SS-run camp. This facility, I> have argued elsewhere, was for the enrichment of uranium and other radioactive> isotopes.3> 2) An instrument of independent finance that is hidden; and> 3) Facilities not generally known or accessible to the general public.In exploring the most crucial component of the breakaway civilization, finance,it is therefore vital to note that this complex story has three broad phases: > 1) The pre-war nexus and relationships between large German and American> corporations and banking houses, a relationship that we shall call “The> Fraternity,” following Charles Higham’s terminology> 2) The wartime creation of vast hidden bureaucracies and infrastructure to> conduct its research and production; and,> 3) The post-war reeastablishment of the nexus of relationships, and the> possibilities of factional infighting within that structure.In our examination in this chapter, we shall concentrate on the first and thirdof these points, leaving the second point to a later chapter, for the creationof the infrastructure of this breakaway civilization fulfills—in a very oddfashion—Quigley’s distinction of “core” and “peripheral” societies within acivilizaiton. Additionally, as our examination in previous chapters focused onpsychological warfare operations, our focus now becomes centered on the othercomponent activities of this breakaway civilization: > 1) Its instruments for the generation of surplus, i.e., the instruments of> financing its activities. In this respect, we note that there are three basic> sources of funding, all interlocked and evident within the above pre-war and> post-war patterns of relationships:> a) Overt funding from state budgets;> b) Covert, or “black budget” funding that is “off-the-books”of official> budgets, or whose items are hidden from scrutiny; and> c) Criminal, or underground and completely independentsources of funding. This> will be particularly evident in the post-war period.> 2) Its sponsorship of terrorism as a component of its psychological warfare;4> 3) Its instruments for the invention of technology, i.e., the basic> bureaucratic structure of its research.We have already noted in previous chapters that the Nazis deliberately plannedto reconstitute the pre-war nexus of relationships with the American corporateworld in the post-war period, supplemented by vast intelligence exchangeshighlighted by the bargain between Allen Dulles and German General ReinhardGehlen. Thus, any history or hypothetical reconstruction of a breakawaycivilization that does not take into account these Nazi plans is perforce aflawed history and reconstruction.A. The Pre-War Tapestry1. The Central Ideological Component: The \"Empire of Money\" Before the war, Hitler’s Reichsbank President, Dr. Hjalmar Horace GreeleySchacht, moved in the elite circles of American and German corporate and bankingpower, to such an extent that he was convinced that the power of high financecould lead to “a world community of money that would be independent of wars andempires.”5 Schacht, who had imbibed these ideas from the American financialelite, passed them on to his friends, Carl Krauch and Hermann Schmitz, whom heaided to found the huge I.G. Farben chemicals cartel, a cartel so large andpowerful that when one says “Nazi War Machine,” one is essentially talking aboutI.G. Farben.6 This idea of a “world community” or “empire” of money is already asignificant clue and argument that these Tsars of corporate cartels and highfinance already viewed themselves as a distinct social entity, as a breakaway“civilization,” able, and willing, to influence the rest of the world accordingto their designs.For example, Carl Krauch, the founder of I.G. Farben, was encouraged by Schachtto develop a series of crucial friendships in England and the United States,always aiming unerringly for the greatest powers. One of his earliest allies wasWalter Teagle of Standard Oil, who shared his views on international financialsolidarity. Another was Edsel Ford, son of Henry Ford.> In 1929, Schmitz, his nephew, Max Ilgner, Walter Teagle, Edsel Ford, and> Charles E. Mitchell of the ever-reliable National City Bank jointly set up the> American Farben organization known as American I.G./Chemical Corp. Hermann> Schmitz became president, with his brother Dietrich delegated to take over in> his absence in Europe….> In 1931, President Herbet Hoover received Schmitz at the White House. Hoover> shared Schmitz’s attitude toward Russia: that it must be crushed.7Such links between large American corporations and banks and the huge Germancartels were a common feature of pre-war financial arrangements.a. Dr. Quigley Again Here we must return to Dr. Quigley once again, and to the purpose for thesearrangements, for in creating them, the German and American factions of this“empire of money” were, in effect, establishing the long-term structure of thebreakaway civilization, as the Nazis made it a deliberate component of theirplans to survive the war intact as a major though extra-territorial influence inglobal affairs. In short, the German and American factions of this empire ofmoney existed before the war. What was new during and after the war, was theinjection of Nazism as yet another contending faction within it, with all itsideological and covert operations commitments. It is therefore crucial to one’sunderstanding of the breakaway civilization to have an understanding of thepre-war structure of these arrangements.Quigley’s views on these matters were expressed in his opus magnum, Tragedy andHope: A History of the World in Our Time, a book that has become something of a“bible” for conspiracy theorists ever since its publication by the MacMillanpublishing house— related to the British Prime Minister of that name—in 1966.Quigley had no hesitations about revealing his “insider knowledge” of themachinations of the international bankers and corporate cartels: > There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international> Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical> Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may> identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the> Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so. I know of the> operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was> permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret> records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of> my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected,> both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies (notably to its belief> that England was an Atlantic rather than a European Power and must be allied,> or even federated, with the United States and must remain isolated from> Europe), but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to> remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be> known. 8Heady, powerful words indeed from a tenured professor at Georgetown, for thesewere not the ravings of some “lunatic fringe” conspiracy theorist, but of a manvery much a part of the academic establishment.The aims of this group—and we shall deal with its American and Britishcomponents in a moment before turning our attentions to the German one—was,according to Quigley, “largely commendable,” namely, “to coordinate theinternational activities and outlooks of all the English-speaking world intoone...”9 Elsewhere, however, Quigley is less euphemistic: > In addition to these pragmatic goals, the powers of financial capitalism had> another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of> financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of> each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be> controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in> concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences.> The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in> Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world’s central> banks, which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank, in the> hands of men like Monague Norman of the Bank of England, Benjamin Strong of> the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Chales Rist of the Bank of France, and> Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank, sought to dominate its government by its> ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to> influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence> cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business> world.10Note the mention of feudalism, for this is a crucial component of thelonger-term story, one which I hope to address in a future book.For our purposes of the moment, however, we note the crucial role played by theBank of International Settlements in Basle, a point to which we shall returnshortly. But to understand its central role in the tapestry of pre-World War Twofinancial arrangements, we need to look closer at the context of thoseinstruments of power that Quigley surveys. > The chief backbone of this organization grew up along the already existing> financial cooperation running from the Morgan Bank in New York to a group of> international financiers in London led by Lazard Brothers.11The London branch of this network was headed by Lord Milner, who founded anumber of banks that would eventually become one of Britain’s largest, theMidland Bank.12 Milner placed his disciples and associates in key positionsthroughout Great Britain, including “the editorship of The Times, the editorshipof The Observer,” various banks, and the Universities of Oxford and London.13The end of the First World War necessitated that this system be extendedthroughout the British Commonwealth, and accordingly, front groups for thisEmpire of Money were established in the various Commonwealth nations.14 > This front organization, called the Royal Institute of International Affairs,> had as its nucleus in each area the existing submerged Round Table Group. In> New York it was known as the Council on Foreign Relations, and was a front for> J.P. Morgan and Company…> The New York branch was dominated by the associates of the Morgan bank. For> example, in 1928 the Council on Foreign Relations had John W. Davis as> president, Paul Cravath as vicepresident, and a council of thirteen others,> which included Owen D. Young, Russell C. Leffingwell, Norman Davis, Allen> Dulles, George W. Wickersham, Frank L. Polk, Whitney Shepardson, Isaiah> Bowman, Stephen P. Duggan, and Otto Kahn…> The academic figures have been those linked to Morgan, such as James T.> Shotwell, Charles Seymour, Joseph P. Chamberlain, Philip Jessup, Isaiah Bowman> and, more recently, Philip Moseley, Grayson L. Kirk, and Henry M. Wriston. The> Wall Street contacts with these were created originally from Morgan’s> influence in handling large academic endowments. In the case of the largest of> these endowments, that at Harvard…> Closely allied with this Morgan influence were a small group of Wall Street> law firms, whose chief figures were Elihu Root, John W. Davis, Paul D.> Cravath, Russell Leffingwell, the Dulles brothers and, more recently, Arthur> H. Dean, Philip D. Reed, and John J. McCloy.15We shall return to the Dulles brothers, and in particular, to Allen Dulles, in amoment.It is crucial to note that the “Empire of Money,” both in its British andAmerican branches, had after the First World War made deep penetrations into themost prestigious academic institutions in each country, and thus, exercisedinfluence over what Quigley himself would call the “instruments of invention.”Effectively, the same system and structural alliances were mirrored in eachcountry. For example, the Morgan faction—and it is important to understand bythis time this also meant the Morgan-Rockefeller faction16— had set up inPrinceton a reasonable copy of the Round Table Group’s chief Oxfordheadquarters, All Souls College. This copy, called the Institute for AdvancedStudy, and best known perhaps, as the refuge of Einstein, Oppenheimer, John vonNeumann, and George F. Kennan, was organized by Abraham Flexner of the CarnegieFoundation and Rockefeller’s General Education Board after he had experiencedthe delights of All Souls while serving as Rhodes Memorial Lecturer at Oxford.17 To put it succinctly, the Empire of Money was founding, in each country, specialinstruments (to use Quigley’s term) for all manner of advanced scientific studyof everything from geopolitics and social engineering to physics. By itsinfluence over the media of the time, it could thus also engage directly inpropaganda and other psychological operations.With this context in mind, we turn to the German faction of this “Empire ofMoney, “ and to a brief consideration of how Nazism penetrated and manipulatedit for its own ends, and why the British and American factions would haveallowed such an arrangement to exist in the first place.2. The Nazi Bank of International Settlementsa. The Problem of German War Reparations, the Dawes and Young Plans, and theEstablishment of the BIS As previously noted, the Bank of International Settlements in Basle,Switzerland, was the keystone in the arch of the Fraternity’s attempt toinfluence international politics and finance. The reason why lies in theVersailles Treaty’s imposition of war reparations on post-World War One Germany,an imposition that, in effect, made Germany pay for the entire war effort of theAllies. Germany, in other words, was mortgaged to the bankers who had loanedmoney to the Allies, and this, in effect, meant that Germany was mortgaged tothe American faction of this international Empire of Money, for American bankswere during the war the only banks with the credit and reserves to loan money,the British and French banks having long exhausted themselves in the war effort.The result of the war reparations was met with an unusual German response, orrather, an unusual response by the German faction of this international empireof money, and here, again, Quigley is a key, requiring the reader to readcarefully between the lines: > Instead of taxing and retrenching, the German government permitted an> unbalanced budget to continue year after year, making up the deficits by> borrowing from the Reichsbank. The result was an acute inflation. This> inflation was not forced on the Germans by the need to pay reparations (as> they claimed at the time) but by the method they took to pay reparations (or> more accurately, to avoid payment). The inflation was not injurious to the> influential groups in German society, although it was generally ruinous to the> middle classes, and thus encouraged the extremist elements. Those groups whose> property was in real wealth, either in land or in industrial plant, were> benefitted by the inflation which increased the value of their properties and> wiped away their debts (chiefly mortgages and industrial bonds).18In 1923, the French responded to this provocation of being paid reparations withincreasingly worthless Reichsmarks by seizing real wealth, and occupiedGermany’s industrial heart, the Ruhr Valley.In response to this, the Germans simply refused to work, called a generalstrike, and effectively ruined the purpose for the French occupation in thefirst place. At this juncture, the Morgan-Rockefeller faction stepped in withthe first of many schemes, the Dawes plan: > The Dawes Plan, which was largely a J.P. Morgan production, was drawn up by an> international committee of financial experts presided over by the American> banker Charles G. Dawes. It was concerned only with Germany’s ability to pay,> and decided that this would reach a rate of 2.5 billion marks a year after> four years of reconstruction. During the first four years Germany would be> given a loan of $800 million and would pay a total of only 5.17 billion marks> in reparations. This plan did not supersede the German reparations obligation.> Thus Germany paid reparations for five years under the Dawes Plan(1924-1929)> and owed more at the end than it had owed at the beginning.> …> Specifically, Germany was able to borrow abroad beyond her ability to pay,> without the normal slump in the value of the mark which would have stopped> such loans under normal circumstances. It is worthy of note that this system> was set up by the international bankers and that the subsequent lending of> other people’s money to Germany was very profitable to these bankers.> The only things wrong with the system were (a) that it would collapse as soon> as the United States ceased to lend, and (b) in the meantime debts were merely> being shifted from one account to another and no one was really getting any> nearer to solvency… Nothing was settled by all this, but the international> bankers sat in heaven, under a rain of fees and commissions.19It is within this context that we may now turn to the Bank of InternationalSettlements, its founding, and how it was subsequently used by the Nazis.To handle all these shifting, shuffling debts, it was decided to create a“Central Bankers’ Bank,” the Bank of International Settlements in Basle,Switzerland, owned by “the chief central banks of the world.” 20 > In the final days of the system, these central bankers were able to mobilize> resources to assist each other through the B.I.S., where payments between> central banks could be made by bookkeeping adjustments between the accounts> which the central banks of the world kept there. The B.I.S. as a private> institution was owned by the seven chief central banks and was operated by the> heads of these, who together formed its governing board. Each of these kept a> substantial deposit at the B.I.S., and periodically settled payments among> themselves (and thus between the major countries of the world) by bookkeeping> in order to avoid shipments of gold.21In other words, the mountain of debt incurred during World War One had faroutstripped the ability of the gold standard to keep pace, and thus, under thecrush of circumstances, it was abandoned in favor of yet a new central bank. > As a matter of fact its establishment in 1929 was rather an indication that> the centralized world financial system of 1914 was in decline. It was set up> rather to remedy the decline of London as the world’s financial center by> providing a mechanism by which a world with three chief financial centers in> London, New York, and Paris could still operate as one. The B.I.S. was a vain> effort to cope with the problems arising from the growth of a number of> centers. It was intended to be the world cartel of ever-growing national> financial powers by assembling the nominal heads of these financial centers.22Accounts could be handled simply by “shifting credits from one country’s accountto another on the books of the bank.”23 But here, Quigley is for once nottelling the whole story.b. The German Faction and the B.I.S. The inspiration for the BIS came from none other than Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, laterpresident of Hitler’s Reichsbank.24 And here the plot thickens, considerably: > Sensing Adolf Hitler’s lust for war and conquest, Schacht, even before Hitler> rose to power in the Reichstag, pushed for an institution that would retain> channels of communication and collusion between the world’s financial leaders> even in the event of an international conflict. It was written into the bank’s> charter, concurred in by the respective governments, that the BIS should be> immune from seizure, closure, or censure, whether or not its owners were at> war.25But that was by no means all. For while the bank was originally and ostensiblycreated to handle the payments and transfers of war reparations between Germanyand the former western Allies, “the Bank soon turned out to be the instrument ofan opposite function. It was to be a money funnel for American and British fundsto flow into Hitler’s coffers and to help Hitler build up his war machine.”26Thus, by the time World War Two broke out in September 1939, the BIS was almostcompletely under the control of Hitler via his various proxies, and includedamong its directors the head of I.G. Farben(of course), Hermann Schmitz, BaronKurt von Schröder, “head of the J.H. Stein Bank of Cologne and a leading officerand financier of the Gestapo; Dr. Walther Funk of the Reichsbank” and EmilPuhl.27 And at the head of this, as president, “was the smooth old Rockefellerbanker, Gates W. McGarrah, formerly of the Chase National Bank and the FederalReserve Bank, who retired in 1933.”28As Charles Higham reports, after the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938, andlater its annexation of Bohemian Czechoslovakia in 1939, the gold reserves ofthose nations fell into Nazi hands. By this time, “the BIS had invested millionsin Germany, while Kurt von Schröder and Emil Puhl deposited large sums in lootedgold in the Bank.”29 In other words, the nexus for the postwar relationshipbetween the Nazis and the Western banksters of London and New York was beingcreated even before the war, and its principal mechanism was the BIS.As the plundered gold of the former Czechoslovakia flowed into the BIS’s vaults,it received a new president, the American Thomas Harrington McKittrick, “anassociate of the Morgans and an able member of the Wall Street establishment.”30The collusion between the Nazis and the Western capitalists continued underMcKittrick, for in 1940, sensing war looming between Germany and the U.S.A.,McKittrick went to Berlin “and held a meeting at the Reichsbank with Kurt vonSchröder of the BIS and the Gestapo. They discussed doing business with eachother’s countries if war between them should come.”31 An even more remarkablejourney was undertaken by McKittrick in 1943, and with it, we see the beginningsof the outline of the shadowy postwar Nazi International beginning to emerge,and with it, the entrance of the third faction—the Nazis— into the postwarstructure of the breakaway civilization:32In the spring of 1943, McKittrick, ignoring the normal restrictions of war,undertook a remarkable journey. Despite the fact he was neither Italian nordiplomat and that Italy was at war with the United States, he was issued anItalian diplomatic visa to travel by train and auto to Rome. At the border hewas met by Himmler’s special police, who gave him safe conduct. McKittrickproceeded to Lisbon, whence he traveled with immunity from U-boats by Swedishship to the United State. In Manhattan in April he had meetings with LeonFraser, his old friend and BIS predecessor, and with the heads of the FederalReserve Bank. Then McKittrick traveled to Berlin on a U.S. passport (!) toprovide Emil Puhl of the Reichsbank with secret intelligence on financialproblems and high-level attitudes in the United States.33But just what was all this unusual travel for?A hint is provided by looking at other pre-war Nazi-American businessrelationships, at meetings of the BIS in 1944, and at the July 1944 bomb plotagainst Adolf Hitler. We have already had occasion to mention the Gestapo manand banker Kurt von Schröder, who maintained business relationships withStandard Oil’s Walter Teagle, with Winthrop Aldrich of the Rockefeller ChaseBank, and with Colonel Sosthenes Behn, head of the American internationalcommunications giant, International Telephone and Telegraph.34 But von Schröderwas not the only Nazi with such links. The head of I.G. Farben, and BIS boardmember Hermann Schmitz, had before the war cultivated a close relationship withnone other than Walter Schellenberg, head of the SS’s notoriousSicherheitdienst, the SD. And here the plot once again thickens: > Army Intelligence documents declassified in 1981 show that Schellenerg> discussed Schmitz as head of a Council of Twelve. The council would place> Hitler under the protection and rulership of Himmler while the Fuhrer remained> a prisoner of Berchtesgaden. Knowing that Schmitz was dedicated to Himmler and> the Gestapo cause, Schellenberg plotted constantly toward this end. However,> Himmler vacillated constantly. He could not bring himself to depose the> Führer, nor did he expose Schellenberg to the Führer.> The underlying purpose of the Schellenberg plan, revealed in the same recently> declassified Army Intelligence report, was clearly to bring about the> negotiated peace between Germany and the United States that was the overriding> dream of The (banking) Fraternity.35In other words, the Fraternity was manipulating behind the scenes to bring anend to the war between Germany and the Western Allies, leaving the Soviet Unionto fend for itself.But what of the American side of this? Enter McKittrick the BIS, and theMorgan-Rockefeller interests once again. In May of 1944, the board of BISconvened a meeting under McKittrick’s oversight “to discuss such importantmatters as the $378 million in gold that had been sent to the Bank by the Nazigovernment after Pearl Harbor for use by its leaders after the war.”36 Ofcourse, the Nazis had originally deposited the gold with the view that afterthey won the war, it would be available for their purposes after its conclusion.But as I wrote elsewhere, after the defeat at Stalingrad in 1943 and the laterfailure of the German offensive at Kursk in July of 1943,37 the plans changed,but now it is to be noted, that while the plans changed according to thecircumstances, the Nazi goal of survival and influence after the war did not,nor did the structures of the financial arrangements they sought to employ inthat purpose. In short, the Nazis decided deliberately to go underground, toconstitute themselves as a breakaway civilization, and to do so in concert withand connection to the American corporate and banking elite.Meanwhile, the American faction of this nexus continued covertly to support theanti-Hitler resistance, in hopes of bringing to power a government in Germanywith which it could negotiate a separate peace. The bomb plot against Hitler inJuly of that year, on the American side, was aided by ITT CEO Sosthenes Behn,with help from none other than Allen Dulles.38We need to pause and consider the full implications of this little- known orappreciated fact. On the German side, the motivation of the anti-Hitler plotterswas first of all, their inside knowledge of impending German success with theatom bomb,39 their reluctance to allow Hitler the possibility of using it, apossibility that would have brought severe Allied reprisals and the completedestruction of Germany. Secondly, this group wished to conclude a separate peacewith the Western Allies to allow them to transfer military resources to theEastern front, and stem the Soviet advance into Eastern Europe. With an atombomb in their hands, the plotters assumed this would have given them negotiatingleverage with the Allies.This latter motivation squared well with the views of the American corporateelite, and hence, explains their willingness to aid in the plot. It does not,however, explain how the American faction planned to deal with the RooseveltAdministration, which had made the unconditional surrender of Germany its warobjective. The answer to this reveals the only possibility that the Americanfaction could have entertained: they hoped, with Hitler’s removal, thatRoosevelt’s re-election chances later that year would be curtailed, and failingthat, they may have had plans to otherwise remove him from office. In thisrespect, it should be recalled that the same corporate interests had, beforeAmerica’s entry into the war, had actually plotted a military coup to removeRoosevelt, a plot that was exposed by Marine Corps general Smedley Butler.To put it succinctly, the American faction’s cooperation with the Anti-Hitlerfaction of the Nazi government reveals the American component of the breakawaycivilization. Dean Acheson, for example, stated that the BIS would be needed tohelp rebuild Germany after the war, and he could not have been oblivious to theheavy Nazi presence and influence in the bank.40Indeed, as early as the summer of 1942, the BIS was functioning as the chokepoint for Nazi currency manipulations in anticipation of the Reich’s defeat, inan effort to ensure the survival of the Party organization and its goals: In the summer of 1942, Pierre Pucheu, French Cabinet member and director of theprivately owned Worms Bank in Nazi-occupied Paris, had a meeting at the BIS withYves Bréart de Boisanger, Pucheu told Boisanger that plans were afoot forGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower to invade North Africa. He had obtained thisinformation through a friend of Robert Murphy, U.S. State Departmentrepresentative in Vichy. Boisanger contacted Kurt von Schröder. Immediately,Schröder and other German bankers, along with their French correspondents,transferred 9 billion gold francs via the BIS to Algiers. Anticipating Germandefeat, they were seeking a killing in dollar exchange. The collaborationistsboosted their holdings from $350 to $525 million almost overnight. The deal wasmade with the collusion of Thomas H. McKittrick, Hermann Schmitz, Emil Puhl, andthe Japanese directors of the BIS.41In other words, the chairman of I.G. Farben, and senior members of theReichsbank and Gestapo, were already laying the foundations for vast currencytransfers, and a vast postwar financial empire, for the postwar NaziInternational. Nazi deposits of gold—much of it looted and plundered from Europeand Holocaust victims—in the BIS allowed the Nazis to begin converting this goldto liquid foreign currency assets for operations after the war.42We must now examine one particular group within the American faction must moreclosely…3. The Rockefeller Link and Its Implications a. Martin Bormann’s Check-Cashing Episode Revisited In my book, The Nazi International, I recounted a curious incident of an unusualcheck that was cashed in the early 1960s, revealed by the former CBS journalist,Paul Manning, an associate of CBS newsman Edward Murrow. Manning recorded thecurious incident as follows, referring to FBI files on Martin Bormann’swhereabouts in Latin America:…John Edgar Hoover assigned the investigation tohis most experienced and skillful agent in South America, who proved that he wasjust that by eventually obtaining copies of the Martin Bormann files that werebeing held under strict secrecy by Argentina’s Minister of the Interior in theCentral de Intelligencia. When the file (now in my possession) was received atFBI headquarters, it revealed that the Reichsleiter had indeed been tracked foryears. One report covered his whereabouts from 1948 to 1961, in Argentina,Paraguay, Brazil and Chile. The file revealed that he had been banking under hisown name from his office in Germany in Deutsche Bank of Buenos Aires since 1941;that he held one joint account with the Argentinian dictator Juan Perón, and onAugust 4, 5, and 14,1967, had written checks on demand accounts in FirstNational City Bank (Overseas Division) of New York, The Chase Manhattan Bank,and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., all cleared through Deutsche Bank of BuenosAires.43The implications of this event are staggering, and reveal the full extent of thebreakaway civilization, for on the one hand, it is apparent that officialagencies of the U.S. government are committing resources to discover thewhereabouts of the infamous Nazi Party Reichsleiter, yet, clearly his existenceis known to private American banking interests connected with the Rockefellerinterests!. In other words, those interests are acting counter to the goals andobjectives of the American government, and to that extent, symbolizes theAmerican component of the breakaway civilization. It therefore requires a closerlook.b. The Pre-War Rockefeller Group-Nazi Links The Nazi-Rockefeller links suggested by “the Bormann check- cashing affair” infact pre-dated the war, and were maintained during the war, by both parties. TheChase bank, at the time of the American entry into World War Two, was the UnitedStates’ largest and by any accounts its most powerful bank. It was the lynchpinin the enormous Rockefeller corporate empire, as it handled the accounts for theRockereller empire’s other large corporate concern, Standard Oil. Additionally,it was the bank that also handled ITT’s accounts, the accounts for the Americanbranches of I.G. Farben and its subsidiaries, and thus, had close contacts withthe BIS, and the corporate and Gestapo elite of Nazi Germany.44Here, as Charles Higham’s meticulous research points out, the relationshipbecomes very deeply intertwined with the Gestapo, and the BIS, and reveals evenmore sinister postwar implications: > As war approached, the links between the Rockefellers and the Nazi government> became more and more firm. In 1936, the J. Henry Schröder Bank of New York had> entered into a partnership with the Rockefellers. Schröder, Rockefeller and> Company, Investment Bankers, was formed as part of an overall company that> Time magazine disclosed as being “the economic booster of the Rome-Berlin> Axis.” The partners in Schröder, Rockefeller and Company included Avery> Rockefeller, nephew of John D., Baron Bruno von Schröder in London, and Kurt> von Schröder of the BIS and Gestapo in Cologne. Avery Rockefeller owned 42> percent of Schröder, Rockefeller, and Baron Bruno and his Nazi cousin 47> percent. Their lawyers were John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles of Sullivan> and Cromwell. Allen Dulles (later of the Office of Strategic Services) was on> the board of Schröder. Further connections linked the Paris branch of Chase to> Schröder as well as the pro-Nazi Worms Bank and Standard Oil of New Jersey in> France. Standard Oil’s Paris representatives were directors of the Banque de> Paris et des Pays-Bas, which had intricate connections to the Nazis and to> Chase.45The implications of the Rockefeller-Allen Dulles-BIS-Gestapo links revealed hereare nothing less than staggering, for it was Dulles who, of course, negotiatedthe bargain with Nazi General Reinhard Gehlen, head of Germany’s militaryintelligence group for all of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union—the FremdeHeere Ost, or Foreign Armies East—the bargain that later left the immense Nazimilitary intelligence organization intact after the war, and still underGehlen’s operational command, while incorporating it as the “Soviet Desk” of thefuture CIA until such time as West Germany would assume jurisdiction over theorganization.46With the addition of the Rockefeller interests into this equation, and with thepostwar creation of the various American intelligence agencies enacted by the1947 National Security Act—the CIA and the NSA—means that both the NaziInternational and the corporate and banking interests of the USA were not onlyinfluential within those organizations, but that those organizations constitutedone nexus of interaction between them, in addition to the banking connectionsalready surveyed. The breakaway civilization had, in other words, created itsown intelligence group, grafted an already existing Nazi one into it, andcreated a steady source of funding for it: the American taxpayer.In addition to this, the Rockefeller group maintained a network of interlockingdirectorships and relationships with I.G. Farben. The chairman of Standard Oilof New Jersey, Walter C. Teagle, for example, along with its president WilliamS. Farish, maintained close ties with I.G. Farben’s Hermann Schmitz, andactually became the director of American I.G. Chemical Corp, Farben’s Americansubsidiary, and sat on its board along with Edsel Ford.47This arrangement allowed I.G. Farben to protect its patents from seizure by theAmerican government, by simply transferring them to Standard Oil jointownership, with an actual agreement being signed in The Hague that after thewar, regardless of its outcome, the patents would be returned to Farben.48 Inaddition to this, the Rockefeller interests also began the first murkybeginnings of yet another source of independent funding that will play such aprominent role later in this chapter as a source of covert funding, for itsponsored both legal and illegal drug smuggling through an allied corporateinterest, the pharmaceutical company, Sterling Products.49 This was done throughairline connections between Europe and Latin America, chiefly through theL.A.T.I. airline, via Brazil and Argentina, and by Standard Oil ships which had,under Farish’s direction, changed registry from the U.S.A., to Panama. Underthis flag, they were granted immunity from seizure by the then U.S.Under-Secretary of the Navy, James V. Forrestal, who additionally was a memberof the Nazi-Rockefeller nexus, as a vice-president of the American Farbensubsidiary, General Aniline and Film!50In other words, the postwar Nazi concentrations in Latin America had, by dint ofthe pre-war nexus between the American and German cartelists and corporateelite, ample protection for its activities. But there is yet another tellinglink between the American and Nazi factions in this history of this breakawaycivilization and its activities:c. The American and Nazi Elites: A Common Ideological Culture It is a commonplace among researchers of the Rockefeller-Nazi connection thatthe two interests are divided by a common ideology, for on the American side ofthat equation, that corporate elite viewed itself as an elite both of class andof race, fit to rule over the vast masses of “human resources” in its corporateempires, while the same attitude prevailed in Nazism as well. Charles Highamaptly summarizes this ideological commonality: “They understood each other’slanguage and their aims were common.”51But it goes beyond a common ideology, and again, into a common goal andactivity. Researchers Glen Yeadon and John Hawkins, in their seminally importantwork The Nazi Hydra in America, point out yet another connection not only inideology but in actual scientific and sociological technology and practice byobserving that the Rockefeller interest was an early sponsor of eugenicsresearch and sterilization programs, which formed the model for the later Nazirace laws. Additionally, both factions sponsored actual “genetics” research.52d. Oil: Beginnings of the Texas and Radical Islam Connections There is yet another prewar nexus between the American corporate elite ingeneral, the Rockefeller interests in particular, and the Nazis that iscontinued after the war, and this is the link between Standard Oil and the thenemerging Texas oil industry.53A similar nexus emerges during the prewar period between American petroleuminterests, the Nazis, and radical Islam, an interest again fraught withlong-term implications for the activities of the breakaway civilization and itsfactions: > From these sources, from German Foreign Office document 71/51181 (July 22,> 1942) and from recently declassified secret reports prepared by British> Intelligence on Walter Schellenberg of the Gestapo, it is possible to> determine the extent of Nazi influence on (the house of) Ibn Saud in the> middle of the war. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was, until the time of Italy’s> collapse as an Axis partner, living in Rome, working with the agents of Kurt> von Schröder’s friend and associate Ambassador Franz con Papen in Ankara,> Turkey, to send out agents through the Arab states. In Saudi Arabia fanatical> Arabs were trained as Nazis at German universities and schools. From a> headquarters in a carpet shop in Baghdad, Dr. Fritz Grobba, German minister to> Iraq, ran espionage rings, subsidized Arabic newspapers and clubs in the Saudi> Arabian capital of Jidda. The German TransOcean New Agency functioned as an> espionage and propaganda agency in Jidda. The Nazi spy Waldemar Baron von> Oppenheim, until recently in the United States and Syria, was headquartered in> Saudi Arabia. Many Nazis flocked in disguised as tourists or technicians. They> constructed roads and built factories. They formed German-Arab societies and> learned (the) Arab (sic) language so as to address crowds and whip them up> into a fanatical support of Hitler. Ibn Saud, as always, played both ends> against the middle, protesting admiration for Roosevelt and Churchill while> authorizing his personal representative Rashid Ali El-Kilani to continue to> represent him in Berlin and address the Moslem society there.54Again, the implications here are profound, for such Nazi-radical Islamic contactcould not have occurred without the knowledge and tacit approval of the largeAmerican and British petroleum interests on the Arabian peninsula, and thisaffords a clue into the postwar relationships we have seen emerging in theprevious pages, for each faction—the Nazi and the American corporatefaction—would view each other in different ways. The American faction would cometo view its postwar Nazis as its compliant tools, as the soldiers on the groundto execute the tactical planning and operations it deemed necessary. Similarly,the Nazi faction would view its American corporate contacts as compliantinstruments to represent, and launder, its vast financial empire. It was amarriage strictly of convenience, as we shall now see in reviewing the postwarcontinuation and adjustment of these arrangements.B. The Post-War Tapestry The foregoing survey has been necessary to reveal just how, during the postwarperiod, the basic form and structure of the breakaway civilization’s majorfactional relationships remained more or less intact.1. Money Laundering and Blackmail At one point, it was estimated that approximately 15,000 Nazis lived in theU.S.A. alone.55 Additionally, the pre-war nexus between the Rockefellerinterests and the corporate power structures behind Nazism were continued.Researcher and former Justice Department member John Loftus, for example, statesthat Chase Bank owned nearly a third of Thyssen-Krupp in 1973.56 Thyssen, as isnow well- known, had pre-war relationships with Prescott Bush and the Bushfamily, and of course, Krupp was Germany’s notorious armaments maker.57But the relationships go much deeper, and are inclusive of the activities of thebreakaway civilization to cloak its postwar financial activities with the Nazis.In The Nazi International I briefly outlined the meeting held in August 1944, atthe behest of Nazi Party Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, at the Rotes Haus Hotel inStrasburg. There, the Nazi and corporate leadership of Germany schemed the finalstages of the strategic evacuation plan of the Nazi party, and its postwarsurvival as a kind of underground, extraterritorial state.58 I also noted thatwhen CBS journalist Paul Manning queried Allen Dulles on Bormann’s whereaboutsin Latin America, that Dulles indicated he was “on the right track.” As Iindicated in that book, the postwar investigations of the Nazi Rotes Hausmeeting were anything but complete.One reason for this “incompleteness” stems from the role of Sullivan andCromwell, the prestigious Wall Street law firm, in representing U.S. businesseswith Nazis ties, and in particular, to the role of one its most famous members,Allen Dulles, in that venture. The arrangement was convenient, for as Loftusnotes, while some of the firm was representing corporations “whose assets hadbeen seized under the Trading with the Enemy Act because they operated as Nazifronts,” other members of Sullivan and Cromwell “volunteered as the JusticeDepartment’s prosecutors, officially titled the Alien Property Custodians.”59Dulles, as OSS station chief in Zurich, also used his position “to protecthimself and his clients from investigation for laundering Nazi funds back toAmerica.”60 No wonder Bormann could count on the success of his flight capitalplan, for before the war was even over, the financial links that had existedduring the prewar period were being re-forged, as we have seen, exactlyaccording to the Nazis’ own postwar plans.61But this is just the tip of the iceberg of postwar Nazi-American corporaterelationships. Originally, President Roosevelt entrusted the postwarinvestigation of American-Nazi financial relationships—Operation Safehaven— tohis Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau. Morgenthau was, of course, theoriginator of the Morgenthau Plan, a notorious “revenge” document calling forthe complete de-industrialization of Germany and its division into smallermerely agricultural states. He was replaced as the head of Operation Safehavenafter the war by none other than Allen Dulles, who used his position to recruitNazis. From there, it gets even murkier: > Although Dulles destroyed the Safehaven index, a few of Morgenthau’s original> files escaped Dulles’s shredder, and can be found in the wartime State> Department POst Files. For example, in the Switzerland Post files I discovered> the Operation Safehaven investigation of Dulles himself, where he was accused> of laundering money for the Nazis…. The Safehaven files were stolen by Eleanor> Dulles and given to the Zionist intelligence service. They then blackmailed> Nelson Rockefeller into pressuring the Latin American nations to supply the> extra votes in the UN to create the State of Israel.62This is not yet the place to go into the Rockefeller-Latin America-Nazi nexus,but suffice it to say this episode is revealing of another interesting featureof the postwar structure of the breakaway civilization, for it is an indicatorthat within the corporate power structures revolving around New York and theCity of London, there is a rupture, or fissure, between the Rockefellerinterests and the Rothschild interests, a rupture revealed by the closerelationships between the former and the Nazis, and it does not take a Nazirocket scientist to figure out why that fissure exists.2, Nazi Penetration of the West and the Potential of Captured Programs The collusion elaborated above reveals yet another significant and crucial factfor the idea of a breakaway civilization, in that it discloses the extent towhich official U.S. government agencies and official policy could be, and were,captured by external interests and agendas inimical to those of the governmentitself. We are, in short, looking at captured programs, and the beginnings ofthe existence of a parallel structure existing inside those programs andagencies, using them as a host, and for its own purposes. We have noted, forexample, Dulles’ recruitment of Nazis. These were recruited for the StateDepartment’s Office of Policy Coordination, headed by Frank Wisner,63 in effectmeaning that after Truman’s 1948 upset victory over Republican Thomas Dewey,that there were two CIAs, the official one which hunted Nazis, and the otherunofficial one, linked to Wisner and Dulles, that recruited them.64 As Loftusnotes, the very compartmentalized structure of American government agencies andintelligence functioned as a way of screening these Nazi programs and cloakingtheir activities.65 And of course, once one enters into such arrangements withthe Nazi devil, the possibility always exists that the Nazi component will turnon its American handlers and blackmail their compliance at the threat of theexposure of the whole program, as indeed did happen.66One is consequently looking at the potential of captured programs in two senses,the first being the penetration of official agencies by a breakaway civilizationcomprised both of an American and of a Nazi component, and the second being theblackmail of the American component by the Nazi one, or vice versa, according tothe dictates of circumstances of the moment.3. The Breakaway Civilization, Radical Islam, and Psychological Warfare:Terrorism One of the most controversial aspects of the postwar history of the breakawaycivilization and its activities is John Loftus’ research into the links betweenthe American corporate elite, the Nazis, and the Muslim Brotherhood, links thatcontinued up to the tragic events of 9/11, so here we must review his case inmore detail. Terrorism—i.e., the calculated application of violence—has longbeen a tool of psychological warfare operations, of Weltanschauungskrieg. Loftusbegins by noting that > The truth… is that the Muslim Brotherhood was the original Arab Nazi movement,> working for British intelligence to crush the infant state of Israel. In the> 1980s it was hired by American intelligence to recruit the Muhajedeen in> Afghanistan, and it is now the parent organization of every Sunni terrorist> group in the Middle East.67The relationship between American corporate interests and radical Islamicelements, according to Loftus, goes back to the 1920s: > During the 1920s three countries were targeted for takeover by the Robber> Barons: Germany, Russia and what is now known as Saudi Arabia. The tactics> were the same: American cartels bribed their way into friendly governments and> then protected their investments by hiring local mercenaries—paid terrorist> groups who watched over their interests.> In Saudi Arabia, the terrorists for hire were known as the Ikhwan al> Muslimeen, the Muslim Brothers, or more colloquially, the Muslim Brotherhood.> The Robber Barons armed this group of fanatical Wahhabists, who drove the> peaceful Hashemite rulers out of Mecca and Medina and installed the House of> Saud. The Saudis named the country after themselves, created an oil company> with their American investors (Aramco), and then promptly threw the Ikhwan> terrorists out of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis were not stupid after all.> The Ikhwan settled primarily in Egypt, where they joined the Egyptian Muslim> Brotherhood created by Hassan Al Banna in 1928. He was a devout admirer and> correspondent with young Adolf Hitler. “In heaven Allah, on earth Hitler” was> their battle cry. Hassan’s Muslim Brotherhood became a fully-integrated arm of> the German intelligence and propaganda networks during WWII. They specialized> in acts of terrorism and assassinations of Allied troops, promising German> General Rommel that he would not find a single Allied soldier left alive when> he arrived in Cairo. 68After the war, of course, Nazism survived, and became the on-the ground troopsfor the CIA-sponsored overthrow of Egypt’s King Farouk, under the leadership ofSS colonel Otto Skorzeny, installing Gamel Abdul Nassar, who turned on his Nazisupporters, threw them out, and invited the Soviets into Egypt.69 At thisjuncture, the American corporate-intelligence component convinced the Saudis totake back the Brotherhood. This they did, employing them, as Loftus notes,throughout the Saudi kingdom as schoolteachers in “a perfect storm of Naziracism and Wahhabbi bigotry.”70 The 1950s also saw the election of DwightEisenhower, and the installation of John Foster Dulles as Secretary of State,and his Nazi-recruiting brother, Allen, as director of the CIA.All of this Nazi recruitment was handled through the State Department’s Officeof Policy Coordination, a haven for postwar Nazi intelligence recruits, and adepartment of the American government with direct links to Nazi General ReinhardGehlen’s military intelligence organization based in Pullach, outside of Munich.When U.S. Army counter-intelligence began to suspect the OPC’s reliance on“former” Nazis, the day-to-day control of its operations was shifted back toGehlen directly.71 Thus, effectively, this means that when the MuslimBrotherhood was recruited by the Reagan administration during the 1980s, the“Arab Nazis” were reactivated as proxies in the war against the Soviets inAfghanistan.72All this throws conventional analysis of the events of 9/11 into a potentialcocked hat, for at one level, the surface level of Arab terrorists hi-jackingairplanes and flying them into buildings, one is dealing with a network that hadbeen in existence from prior to the war, and a network with deep connectionsboth to the American corporate and intelligence worlds, and to the Nazisthemselves.At a second deeper level, one may be dealing, as the 9/11 truth movement sooften argues, with inside knowledge and the tacit permission of a rogue elementwithin the American intelligence and corporate parapolitical structure. But Ibelieve that the physics signatures of the collapse of the Twin Towers and otherevidence in New York City on that day do not point to the use of controlleddemolitions to bring down the towers, but to the existence of a verysophisticated and exotic directed energy weaponry, a thesis which I share withthe 9/11 researcher Dr. Judy Wood.73(And that fact points to a third, deeper layer of involvement on that day, one Ibelieve to be the signature of the activity of this breakaway civilization, andperhaps suggesting that the postwar marriage of convenience between the Americancorporate elite and the postwar Nazi International had finally broken down.Obviously, such a case would have to be argued in much greater detail, the task,perhaps, for a future work devoted to that subject. For now, however, it isworth noting that the Twin Towers constitute symbols of that Anglo-Americancorporate power and their long association with the fraternity that so embodiesthat elite, Freemasonry, and with the “twin pillars” Jachin and Boaz that adornany Masonic lodge. The strike, in other words, was a strike against the symbolsof that corporate power, sending very strong and deliberate messages to it: “wehave perfected the technology we have been investigating since the war.” It was,in my opinion, the announcement of divorce.)4. The Skorzeny Connection The use of terror on this scale, and to this implied degree of technologicalsophistication, returns us once again to the crucial figure of SS colonel OttoSkorzeny, who first proposed use of advanced technology in connection with aWeltanschauungskrieg, and to his postwar activities.It was Skorzeny who played a central role in Bormann’s plan to evacuate liquidand hard assets in the form of cash and various bullions out of Europe to safehavens in South America.74 As such, Skorzeny was an early target of America’swar-end intelligence efforts, not so much to bring him to trial for war crimes,but to employ him in its own postwar anti-Communist efforts.75 As such, Skorzenyis the link between Bormann’s Nazi International in South America, Gehlen’spostwar group of Nazi spies in Eastern Europe based out of Pullach, and Americanintelligence, and had in fact even met with America’s OSS chief, General WilliamDonovan after the war in Nuremberg.76 Yet, as all of these links were forged,Skorzeny maintained contact with the SS elements behind the Iron Curtain thathad ostensibly gone over to serve the Communist cause!77 Skorzeny was alsorelated to Hjalmar Schacht, having married his niece and was in frequent contactwith Schacht himself both from his headquarters in Spain, and later during theaftermath of the overthrow of King Farouk.78 It was during that aftermath, whenthe Nazis had not yet been thrown out of Egypt by Nasser, that Skorzeny and hisNazis, with Nasser’s approval, conducted pogroms and murders against EgyptianJews, confiscating over $100 million of Jewish property in the “New Egypt.”79The nexus of postwar terrorist operations, then, can be traced to Skorzeny’sbranch of the Nazi International, and its deep connections both to radicalIslamicism, and to the elite of the American corporate world and rogue groupswithin American intelligence.5. The Final Source of Deepest Black Funding:Drugs and the Nazi International Thus far, our survey of the history and activities of the financial matrix ofthe breakaway civilization has highlighted two sources of funding, or“instruments of surplus creation” to use Quigley’s nomenclature, namely, Naziplunder from a looted Europe, moved into and laundered through Western Banks,largely in New York, and the implicit funding of its activities through theAmerican taxpayer. These activities were, however, supplemented by a thirdcomponent of funding, one guaranteeing a steady source for financing its goalsand activities, and one, moreover, that was independent of any government’soversight or scrutiny. That source was through the criminal underground, and thegrowing worldwide trade in illegal drugs.This story begins in the 1970s, when a major effort was mounted by rogueelements within American intelligence, and by the postwar Nazi International, torestructure the entire global heroin trade, closing off the old “FrenchConnection” through Marseilles, and reorienting it through the Southeast Asian,Mexican, and Latin American drug cartels.80 Placing the lucrative Latin Americanand Mexican cartels’ trade in league with the postwar Latin American Nazis andFascists gave this component of the breakaway civilization a virtuallyinexhaustible source of money to fund its activities, from terrorism toresearch.This group had pulled off a number of spectacular robberies in Europe, includingthe theft of gold bullion from the Société Générale de Nice, had been implicatedin various assassination attempts on French President Charles DeGaulle, and hadconnections to terrorist and Fascist groups in Italy, Lebanon, and Britain. Sopervasive and deep were these connections that “a number of newspapers, evenincluding the New York Times, mentioned speculations” that it might be theactivity of a “Fascist International.”81By the time of the ITT-Nazi-CIA sponsored coup against Chilean PresidentSalvadore Allende in 1973, this group had made deep penetration into the Cubanexile community (a fact already in evidence as early as the Bay of Pigs fiasco),and had scattered connections throughout Argentina, Chile, and Brazil. 82The Nazi component of the breakaway civilization moved quickly to solidify itsties and influence over the international drug trade. As this drug trade wasbeing restructured in the early 1970s, Miami became a haven for the activity ofEuropean Fascists, and this led researcher Henrik Krüger to begin asking someinteresting questions. Those questions, and his answers, are worth citing insome detail: > What are European Fascists doing in Miami before and after major operations?> Why are Miami-based Cuban exiles executing contracts on young Spaniards? Why> was the main station of the CIA-supported Fascist front World Service in> Miami? Why did bank robber Spaggiari contact the CIA in the United States?> Miami is the center of a huge conspiratorial milieu whose personnel wind> through the Bay of Pigs, attempts on Castro’s life, the JFK murder and the> great heroin coup, and which is now reaching out with a vengeance to Latin> America and Europe.> To trace the roots of this milieu we must refer to the immediate aftermath of> World War II, when the CIA began its close cooperation with Adolf Hitler’s> espionage chief, Reinhard Gehlen, and the Soviet general, Andrei Vlassov, of> Russia’s secret anti-Communist spy network. Vlassov’s organization was> absorbed into Gehlen’s, which evolved into a European subsidiary of the CIA.> U.S. and German agents mingled in Berlin and West Germany, paving the way for> inroads into U.S. intelligence by former Nazis, SS agents, and Russian> czarists.> Headquarters of the CIA/Gehlen/Vlassov combine, staffed in the mid-fifties by> 4000 full-time agents, were in Pullach, near Munich. There Gehlen sang to the> tune of more than one piper, having remained in touch with the old Nazi> hierarchy relocated in Latin America, whose coordinator, Otto Skorzeny, was in> Spain. Skorzeny had infiltrated the Spanish intelligence agency DGS, and> effectively controlled it single-handedly.> With the onset of the Cold War, Gehlen’s agents were recruited by the CIA for> assignments in the United States, Latin America and Africa. One agent,> reportedly, was Frank Bender, allegedly alias Frank Swend, a key figure in the> Bay of Pigs invasion.83But this isn’t the half of it.From his headquarters in Albufera, Spain,84 Skorzeny’s goal in penetrating andallying with the powerful Latin American drug cartels was not only to provide alimitless source of funding, but to create nothing less than an alliance ofright wing terrorists with connections to the old anti-Gaullist OAS in France,and Spanish, Argentine, Italian, Brazilian and Central American Fascists.85These groups “and other Nazi and Fascist powers throughout Europe and LatinAmerica, envisioned a new world order built on a Fascist Iron Circle linkingBeunos Aires, Santiago, Lima, la Paz, Brasilia and Montevideo.”86With this alliance, the Nazi International embarked on a campaign of terror andassassination in South America known as Operation Condor, with oblique CIAapproval, a grim reminder of Skorzeny-led commando oeprations behind Americanlines during World War Two, also known as Operation Condor, all the whilecloaking its activities as those of the radical left!87 The end result of thiscampaign was, of course, the consolidation of the South American drug cartels,and a new source of funding for the breakaway civilization. 88And speaking of Latin America, there is one final connection we must nowexplore…6. The Argentina-Rockefeller-Nazi Connection Argentina, as I have reported in The Nazi International, was home to a majorpostwar Nazi research effort in advanced technology ostensibly investigatingcontrolled fusion, but in reality, connected to its wartime Bell project andinvestigations of antigravity and zero-point energy.89 But it is in Argentinathat one discovers yet another nexus between the American corporate elite andthe postwar Nazi International: > Nelson Rockefeller’s role in Latin America during the War was to coordinate US> intelligence and covert operations in the days before the creation of the CIA.> He was the direct liaison between President Franklin Roosevelt and British> Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s personal intelligence head for the> Americas, Sir William Stephenson, who directed a front company called British> Security Coordination or BSC. Notably, Stephenson’s clandestine headquarters> for his covert activity was in room 3603 in Rockefeller Center, in New York> City, not far from Nelson’s office.90We have already noted the statements of John Loftus that the files ofRockefeller associate Allen Dulles were used by various Zionist organizations toblackmail the Rockefeller interest into using its influence in Latin America tosecure enough UN votes to recognize the State of Israel.As researcher F. William Engdahl notes, “This included the pro-Axis regime ofJuan Peron in Argentina. Rockefeller and Washington pressured Peron toofficially declare war on Germany and Italy, even though it was two weeks beforethe war’s end. That allowed Argentina to vote with the winning side.”91 But thiswas, with due respect to Mr. Engdahl, not the real reason for thebehind-the-scenes maneuvering of the Rockefeller interests in Argentina’sdeclaration of war.We have already noted, throughout this chapter, that the American and Nazicomponents of the breakaway civilization were beginning to reconstitute theirprewar links even before the war ended, and these links especially included theRockefeller interest. We have seen also the role of Allen Dulles in launderingNazi money, and in recruiting Nazis into the American bureaucraticinfrastructure of postwar American intelligence.Given the fact that the Nazis were conducting postwar research into advancedtechnologies in Argentina, and given the Rockefeller influence both inlaundering Nazi plunder and in coercing the Argentine declaration of war, we aretherefore justified in concluding that the real purpose of this, as far as theRockefeller group was concerned, was to provide an Argentine homeland for Nazisthat it did not wish to see come to America, and to maintain a degree ofinfluence over their advanced technologies. In short, it wished to keep the mostadvanced technologies out of the hands of the American government, a goal whichthe Nazis themselves also shared. It was, once again, a marriage of convenience.C. Conclusions We are now, finally, in a position to summarize the financial matrix in whichthe crystal of the breakaway civilization grew. Summarizing the features of thefinancial relationships surveyed in this chapter, we take note of the followingpoints: > 1) Nazism, in its beliefs and ideology, and its genocidal pratice, constituted> itself as a breakaway civilization, and for a brief moment, took Germany and> the rest of Europe down that path;> 2) The nexus of financial relationships between the American and German> corporate elites prior to World War Two constituted, and viewed themselves as,> a Fraternity or Empire of Money, willing and fit to rule over the rest of> humanity within their sphere of influence. As such, this breakaway society was> both a parasitic and a producing society, controlling the necessary> instruments of surplus and invention, as revealed by the numerous links> between that elite and the scientific and academic world. These connections,> as noted, included a deep study of the techniques of psychological operations> and social engineering, and the use of those operations in conjunction with> the development of advanced technology, in order to engineer the> interpretation and perceptions of that technology in broader society. In the> case of Adamski, the fascist connections of his associations and the fascist> nature of his “teaching” strongly suggest that much of the early contactee> literature was an operation of this sort;> 3) Additionally, we have seen the emergence of a postwar permanent> intelligence-gathering structure with deep connections both to the Nazi and to> the American components of this breakaway civilization. In effect, this gave> that civilization the ability to gather intelligence and to conduct ongoing> black operations, including psychological operations inclusive of terrorist> actions;> 4) This breakaway civilization, through its American and British components,> also maintained close ties with major media organs and outlets, allowing> softer forms of psychological warfare and social engineering to be practiced> on a wide population;> 5) Via its easy access to large banking institutions and a deliberately> feudalist structure of central banks clustered around the Bank for> International Settlements, this Empire of Money also had access to the> instruments of surplus, as well as instruments by which to launder money from> almost any source. This deliberately feudal structure is also a clue, again,> to the breakaway mentality of the Fraternity, since it views itself in> mediaeval fashion as the lords over the serfs;> 6) The above facts also highlight the nature of the mechanisms of funding for> its activities and research, since, as we have indicated, there are three> different sources for this financing:> a) Overt funding through taxation of the general populace in the various> countries hosting the Fraternity and its institutions, which funding is used> to contract its activities and research;> b) Covert, or “black budget” funding, in budgets that remain parallel to the> official budgets of states, a phenomenon revealed in Nazi Germany by the> parallel SS industrial structure, and in the USA by the black budget funding> of secret research such as the Manhattan project. Such sources of funding do,> however, depend upon the collusion of officials and agencies of that part of> the state representing its budgetary oversight, and is thus never entirely> “black”;> c) Underground, or criminal sources of funding, which, as we have seen in this> brief survey, include the worldwide traffic in illegal drugs, a trade which> was massively restructured in the 1970s with the assistance of the postwar> international Fascist organization.

It is however, worthnothing that Loftus makes yet another connection: “Brown Brothers Harriman hadso many corrupt ties to the Nazi regime that it became the only bank in New YorkState history ever to obtain permission to shred its war time and prewar files.It certainly had the influence to pull this off—two of its Nazi investmentclients, Nelson Rockefeller and Averell Harriman, had become Governors of NewYork.” (Loftus, op. cit., p. 17).58 Farrell, The Nazi International, pp. 63-83.59 Loftus, America’s Nazi Secret, p. 2.60 Ibid., p. 5.61 Loftus goes further, and notes that the “British SIS reported that Dulles’sAmerican clients, including the Rockefellers, were helping the Nazis bylaundering oil supplies through neutral countries. When FDR demanded that (theDepartment of) Justice indict the corporations, DOJ settled for a minorfinancial penalty. In defense of DOJ, it must be noted that Dulles’s corporatecartel did threaten to withhold oil supplies for D-Day unless all charges weredropped.” (op. cit., p. 7, n. 11) This included an investigation led by WilliamJ. Rockler, who was investigating Hitler’s paymaster, Dr. Hermann Josef Abs,later CEO of Deutsche Bank and a principal attendee at early Bilderbergermeetings. (See Loftus, op. cit., p. 8, and my Babylon’s Banksters, pp. 64-70).62 Loftus, America’s Nazi Secret, p. 12, n. 20. Loftus also notes that the realreason Roosevelt wanted the Nazi bankers put on trial at Nuremberg was in orderfor them to point the finger at their American counterparts, so that chargescould then be brought bagainst them for treason. (Loftus, op. cit., p. 13). Asit was, this was wishful thinking on Roosevelt’s part, for this would haveexposed a crucial component of the postwar structures that the Nazis needed toensure their survival and recrudescence.It is also worth observing that the postwar Deutsche Bank mandarin, Dr. HermannJosef Abs, was not only an early Bilderberger attendee, but during the early1980s was appointed to a special Vatican council investigating the BancoAmbrosiano and Roberto Calvi banking scandals that so rocked the Vatican, havingimplications, according to some, for the mysterious and untimely death of AlbinoLuciani (Pope John Paul the First). (See Charles Higham, American Swastika: TheShocking Story of Nazi Collaborators in our Midst from1933 to the Present Day(Doubleday and Company, 1985, p. xiv.) Higham expresses his disbelief andpuzzlement over Abs’ appointment by the Holy See to this commission, but itshould not be at all surprising, since with the election of Pope John Paul II,his close advisor, Josef Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI), became oneof the most influential advisors to the new pontiff.63 It is worth noting here that the OPC was implicated by Colonel FletcherProuty in the assassination of President Kennedy, adding yet another hiddenrogue intelligence-Nazi connection to the murder.64 Loftus, America’s Nazi Secret, p. 21.65 Ibid., p. 34.66 Ibid., p. 49.67 Loftus, America’s Nazi Secret, p. viii.68 Loftus, America’s Nazi Secret, pp. 13-14.69 Farrell, The Nazi international, pp. 191-200.70 Loftus, America’s Nazi Secret, p. 15.71 Ibid., pp. 30-31, 33, 45.72 Ibid., p. 24.73 See her superb gathering of 9/11 evidence and arguments for the directedenergy weapon hypothesis: Judy Wood, B.S., M.S., Ph.D., Where Did the TowersGo?: Evidence of Directed Free Energy Technology on 9/11.74 Charles Higham, American Swastika: The Shocking Story of Nazi Collaboratorsin Our Midst from 1933 to the Present Day (Doubleday and Company, Inc., 1985),pp. 247-248.75 Ibid.,p. 243.76 Ibid., p. 249.77 Ibid.78 Ibid., pp. 250-251.79 Ibid., p. 253.80 Peter Dale Scott, “Foreword,” to Henrik Krüger, The Great Heroin Coup: Drugs,Intelligence, and International Fascism (Boston, South End Press: 1980), p. 3.81 Ibid., p. 9.82 See p. 10 of Scott’s Foreword.83 Henrik Kröger, The Great Heroin Coup: Drugs, Intelligence, and InternationalFascism, pp. 204-205.84 Ibid., p. 209.85 Kröger, The Great Heroin Coup, p. 209.86 Ibid.,p. 210.87 Ibid.,pp. 212-213.

In Mesopotamiancivilization the core states like Uruk, Kish, Ur, Nippur, and Lagash wereconquered by more peripheral states like Agade and Babylon. These in turn wereconquered by peripheral Assyria, and the whole of western Asia was ultimatelyconquered by fully peripheral Persia.”Dr. Carroll Quigley1As is evident from the previous epigraph, Dr. Quigley’s historical analysis ofthe rise and fall of civilizations included the idea that there were “core”areas within each civilization, and “peripheral” ones. Briefly stated, the“core” area of a civilization was the region, society, or more recently, thenation, that stamped its culture, ideology, and social structures most indeliblyon the rest of the societies that shared it. The core regions were, in thissense, the most influential. The peripheral areas were denoted by a partialadaptation of the cultural values of the core.This conception bore certain consequences and implications for Quigley’sanalysis of modern history, in that, so far as western civilization wasconcerned, the “core” area during the period leading up to and away from the twoworld wars encompassed the nations of the United Kingdom, France, and the UnitedStates, with central and eastern Europe—Germany and the successor states to theAustro-Hungarian empire—forming important peripheral states, partiallyinfluenced by the culture of the west but, in their political and socialorganization, departing from the core by not being true representativedemocracies.The key conception behind both “core” and “peripheral” societies within acivilization was location: both occupied clearly definable regions. But in thecase of the breakaway civilization we have been examining, we are not in such aneasy position, for as is by now evident, the structure of this civilization isparasitic: it exists alongside of, and within, host societies or nations, andindeed has an international extent, crossing the borders and boundaries ofnormal national organization. How, then, one would define the “core” and“periphery” of such a civilization? Where would one locate it?A. The Historical Matrix of World War Two The clue, again, begins during World War Two, and again, specifically in NaziGermany, for here the circumstances of history combined to create the unusualconditions necessary for the emergence of a breakaway civilization, firstly, inthe acceptance of an ideology vastly at variance with the surrounding values of“Western Civilization,” and secondly, in the creation of a “state within astate” that the SS represented, and by its creation, in turn, of the actualphysical locations to carry on its secret “breakaway” activities, from genocideto black projects research, with the two activities often tied to the very samefacilities. It was within these facilities of a “State within the State” that wediscover both (1) the instruments of the generation of surplus, (2) theinstruments for invention in the black research projects undertaken by theKammlerstab of SS General Hans Kammler, and other bureaucracies of the SS, and(3) the combined “producing” and “parasitic” qualities of the civilization thatwe have remarked upon previously.1. The Importance and Significance of the Kammlerstab to theEvolution of the Breakaway Civilization Before we look more closely at the actual physical plants of this breakawaycivilization, it is worth pausing to consider the significance of theKammlerstabonce again, for it affords yet another important clue into the nature of thebreakaway civilization, both in its “Nazi,” and in its “American”, postwarcomponents. As I first observed in Reich of the Black Sun, the Kammlerstab wasessentially a “think tank,” a super-secret research group tasked verydeliberately to think outside the box of conventional scientific models, for theNazis, this effectively meant that scientists were expected to develop paradigmsof physics different from the relativistic physics model of “Jewish physics”that were the regnant standard model. They were expected to develop the basicoutlines of technology trees to lead to second, third, and even fourthgeneration weapons of all sorts, and to lay the groundwork of what was needed toachieve them.2. The Ideological and Scientific Culture of the Kammlerstab and aModern Parallel An ideological culture of scientific research and development was thusestablished that was vastly different from the surrounding civilization, aculture in which science itself was drafted to serve a political agenda ofempire-building and hegemony via technological means. This mentality isreflected in the locations and physical plants, and in the sociology that theyengender. Indeed, as we shall discover in the next chapter, this “sociology ofweaponry” was itself a crucial area of investigation for Dr. Quigley. We findthe modern parallel of the Kammlerstab in modern America, for example, in suchagencies as The Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency, or DARPA, whosemission brief—thinking outside the box and charting the necessary steps in thetechnology trees—seems to be directly modeled on the example of the Kammlerstab.3. The Direct Interface Between the Kammlerstab and The CartelizedCorporate World There is also another feature of the Kammlerstab that is also quite crucial topoint out in connection with the Nazi-corporate interfaces we have examined inprevious chapters, and that is its direct relationship with the main corporaterepresentative connected with its secret research and its ability to tap intothe vast labor pools represented by the concentration camps. In Reich of theBlack Sun I observed that Kammler himself was the actual designer of theAuschwitz camp,2 was directly in command of the SS Buildings and Worksdepartment,3 and that I.G. Farben had constructed a large synthetic rubber orBuna plant at Auschwitz, which was most likely a plant for the enrichment ofuranium and other radioactive elements on a vast scale,4 utilizing the latesttechnologies, perhaps even including laser isotope enrichment, to do so.5 Inother words, within the structure of wartime Nazi secret research, we discoverthe direct relationship of the “state within a state,” the SS, with theinternational corporate world represented by I.G. Farben, a relationshipbypassing the ordinary bureaucratic structures of the German government itself.This, again, will bear enormous consequences for the postwar structure of thebreakaway civilization.B. The Breakaway Civilization and the Underworld As is now well-known, prior to and during World War Two, the German government,and later the SS, constructed a number of enormous underground complexes, fromcommunications centers, to entire factories and research facilities. In so faras these facilities are connected to the SS, they represent the actual physicallocations for the emergence of a peripheral civilization in the very midst ofthe core or host civilization surrounding it, and that for a very important andobvious though often overlooked reason. Like all obvious things, it is easy tooverlook precisely because it is so very obvious. But before looking at thatobvious reason, we will first look at a sampling of Nazi and Americanunderground installations, and the technologies for constructing them, in orderto highlight the significance of that obvious thing, and its implication for thepossibility of a breakaway civilization.1. The Nazi Pentagon: The Underground Bunker Complex of Zossen Hans George Kampe is a researcher who wrote possibly the only short verbal andgraphic history of what must surely be one of the first examples of thebreakaway civilization’s obsession with security, and secure communications: the“Nazi pentagon,” the huge underground complex of bunkers located in the Germantown of Zossen, south of Berlin. Neither the enormity of these structures northe scope of Kampe’s research can hardly be given due justice in this shortreview, but a look at some of the features of this vast underground bunkercomplex is in order, for its features also disclose prominent aspects of thesociology of the breakaway civilization, evident in the structures it has built,and in the technology required to build them.Consider, for example, this charming, typically German, rural farmhouse:image [images/00026.jpg] Rural Farmhouse over the North Terminus Entrance, Zossen BunkerComplex6Beneath the peaceful, charming exterior, however, lay a hardened concreteframework, and a bombproof entrance to a staircase and elevator descending some10 meters into a huge underground world of bunkers piled three stories deep,teletype, telegraph and telephone exchanges, storage rooms, corridors hundredsof meters long, battery rooms, generator power plants, sewage facilities, radiocommunications facilities… in short, a self-contained underground world,accessed through various “farmhouses” on the surface dotted around the villageof Zossen:image [images/00027.jpg] The Original Design of the North Terminus Entrance to the Zossen Zeppelin BunkerComplex7image [images/00028.jpg] The Original Design for the Junction Complex At Zossen8This vast underground world was home to state of the art communicationsequipment, to secure the Wehrmacht’s communications in all circumstances. Thescale of the complex, and of the technologies housed in its bunkers can only beappreciated by Kampe’s pictures:image [images/00029.jpg] One of the over Four Hundred Line Amplifying Relay Stations in theUnderground Bunkers of Zossen9image [images/00030.jpg] The Army Headquarters Self-Dialing Exchange in the ZeppelinCommunications Bunkers at Zossen10image [images/00031.jpg] The Voice Frequency Telegraph Center in the Zeppelin Bunker Complexat Zossen11The enormous scale of just the Zeppelin communications complex is revealed bythe floor plan of the complex accessed through the “farmhouse”:image [images/00032.jpg] The Upper Floor of Junction Section of the Zeppelin Complex, in itsoriginal design12The lower story of this junction complex contained connecting tunnels to otherbunker complexes at Zossen, each a self-contained functional entity, eachconnected to the others, and each accessed by the sort of deceptive camouflagedentrance such as the “farmhouse” leading into this particular complex.2. The Underground Factories and the Manufacturing, Assembly, andLaunch Facility at Ebensee In addition to these types of complexes, as is now well-known, Nazi Germanyconstructed a number of large underground manufacturing and research facilitiesfor its various secret weapons projects. What is seldom appreciated, however, isthe enormity of some of these facilities, which is yet another of those obviousfacts with enormous and overlooked implications for the conception of abreakaway civilization. As the Allied armies swept into the Reich, itscounterintelligence teams were sent to vacuum the Reich of every conceivabletechnological innovation.However, in the case of the technology and engineering of the undergroundcomplexes themselves, this, obviously, could not be down. But detailed plans andschematics of these sites, and in some cases, artists’ renditions, were madewhen the original German plans could not be recovered. One of these was theenormous rocket manufacture, assembly, and launch complex for the A-10Amerikaraket, or “America rocket,” at Ebensee, a complex whose sheer enormityindicates that, as far as the Nazis were concerned, the rocket bombardment ofthe continental United States was an immanent possibility. The scale of thelaunch facility itself is indicated from this 1945 artist’s drawing of thecomplex entrance:image [images/00033.jpg] Artist’s Rendition of the Ebensee Complex Entrance and LaunchFacility13image [images/00034.jpg] The British and American BIOS/CIOS Captured German Plan of theEbensee Distillation Facility B for Rocket Propellant Production14image [images/00035.jpg] Production Facility A of the Ebensee A-10 Rocket Complex15What is to be noticed about this SS facility is not only its enormity but itsself-containment, for here in one enormous complex was all that was necessaryboth for the production and launch of an enormous intercontinental rocket. Inshort, we are looking at the “state within the state” that was the SS, and itsimmanent ability to literally wage an altogether different type ofwarfare—utilizing then still unconventional technologies—from that of its hostcivilization, Nazi Germany itself.3. A Few Modern American Counterpartsa. The Skunk Works, Pure Research Facilities, and Other Installations The American side of this story is equally, if not more, fascinating andrevealing of the possibilities of a breakaway civilization. We may gain ourentry into this discussion by looking at some of the more well-known undergroundinstallations that are connected both to the private corporate sector and todeeply black covert projects research.Richard Sauder, Ph.D., has published his extensive research into undergroundbasses in an important study, Underground Bases and Tunnels, and a carefulreview of his research is essential here in order for its vast implications forthe hypothesis of a breakaway civilization to be fully appreciated, implicationsSauder himself is alive to: > History teaches us that when a country has an exceptionally powerful military,> and when that military carries out secret policies and agendas like the U.S.> military does (think of the illegal Iran-Contra affair, of super-secret> nuclear bomb testing in Nevada, of the astronomical amounts of money given to> the Pentagon every year for so-called “black projects”), then there is an ever> present danger of that military taking control of the government. That control> could be taken quickly—or gradually. Noisily or quietly. 16The extent of black budget funding for the construction of the sites that Sauderrefers to is substantiated by official U.S. government statements andpublications: > In 1987, Lloyd A. Duscha, the Deputy Director of Engineering and Construction> for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, gave a speech entitled “Underground> Facilities for Defense—Experience and Lessons.”…. Mr. Duscha subsequently> launched into a discussion of the Corps’ involvement, back in the 1960s, in> the construction of the large NORAD underground base beneath Cheyenne> Mountain, Colorado… And then he said: “As stated earlier, there are other> projects of similar scope, which I cannot identify, but which included> multiple chambers up to 50 feet wide and 100 feet high using the same> excavation procedures mentioned for the NORAD facility.”17Such techniques, Sauder notes, were developed by private engineering andconstruction corporations, particularly for “hydroelectric powerhouses” whichare often located deep underground.18Sauder notes that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers distinguishes between twobasic types of underground constructions: (1) those constructed in deepshaft-type fashion, and (2) those which are tunneled into mountains.19 As Sauderalso notes, in 1985 the Corps of Engineers admitted in an official publicationthat there were essentially no technological limitations to the construction ofsuch underground facilities, “under virtually any ground conditions, the mainconstraint” being primarily financial limitations.20Cost appears to have been of little concern to the vast corporate undergroundresearch centers in California, well-known to most researchers as the “skunkworks” of major American defense and aero-space firms:image [images/00036.jpg] Lockheed’s Helendale, California “Skunk Works” Facility. The Runway-like Featureis not a runway.image [images/00037.jpg] Close-up of the Entrance “Bunker” to Lockheed’s Helendale, CaliforniaFacilityWhile we do not know the extent of these facilities, nor how deeply undergroundthey go, there are certain features they all have in common, and there arecertain rumors accompanying them: > The Northrop facility is located near the Tehachapi Mountains, 25 miles to the> northwest of Lancaster (California). THere are rumors that the installation> there goes down as many as 42 levels, and that there are tunnels linking it> with other underground facilities in the area. I do not know whether these> rumors are true or not. There are also reports of many strange flying objects> in the vicinity, of many shapes and sizes. Some are reportedly spherical,> others are alleged to be triangular, elongated, boomerang or disk shaped. And> they are said to range in size up to hundreds of feet in diameter. The> facility itself is engaged in electronic or electromagnetic research of some> sort. There are large radar or microwave dishes and strange-looking pylons to> which various objects can be affixed, ostensibly for the purpose of beaming> electromagnetic radiation at them These pylons rise up from underground, out> of diamond-shaped openings in the middle of long paved surfaces that resemble> aircraft runways, but which, in fact, are not used by aircraft.> …The McDonnell Douglas facility is located at the now closed Gray Butte> airport, northeast of Llano, California. It too has “runways” that are not> runways, with diamond-shaped openings through which huge pylons with strangely> shaped objects mounted on them are raised to the surface. These objects> sometimes resemble elongated disks or flying saucers and have been seen to> glow and change colors. Glowing spheres have also been seen by people in the> area at night. However the nature and function of the spheres is not known.> …The Lockheed installation is adjacent to what used to be the Hellendale (sic> et passim), auxiliary airport, six miles to the north of Hellendale,> California. Just like the McDonnell Douglas and Northrop facilities it also> has the runway-like features, which large diamond-shaped doors through which> huge pylons rise from underground with strange objects attached. This facility> has an obvious underground entrance.21It is now known that most of these facilities were crucial in the development ofstealth technologies, with the pylons and radar dishes being used to test radarcross-sections. 22In short, these facilities were being used for research purposes, and we mayreasonably assume that stealth research was not the only research beingconducted at them, given the expense of constructing what must be largeunderground complexes with the machinery to hoist the pylons. Similar pureresearch facilities are alleged to have been constructed at the Manzano Mountainnear Albuquerque, New Mexico, and at Los Alamos National Laboratories, thelatter for “pure physics” research.23 In Los Alamos’ case, proposals wereadvanced for mile-or-deeper facilities for doing experiments in particle physicsand gravity research,24 the latter fact, as we shall see in the next chapter,connecting to the work of American physicist Thomas Townsend Brown.Sauder notes that a number of these facilities, especially those dedicated tocontinuity of government operations and functions, come totally equippedunderground lakes, cafeteria, hospitals, streets and sidewalks, dormitories,radio and TV studies, independent power generation, and tunnels for vehicles, inshort, with all the amenities of the “surface civilization,”25 a fact thattestifies once again to the fact that the breakaway civilization—if indeed therebe one—is literally an “underworld”, a peripheral civilization existingliterally beneath the surface of the core civilizations.It is important to mention that in its planning of these facilities, bothgovernment and private corporations have developed three technologies forindependent sources of power, completely separate from the public power gridsystem, in diesel generating plants, nuclear plants, and fuel celltechnologies,26 a fact that again implies that, should those with control overthese installations choose to break away from the surface host civilization,they could do so. Additionally, private corporations such as the Federal Reservemaintain their own facilities for the emergency maintenance of their corporateaccounts and records.27There is a final possibility for such underground installations and a breakawaycivilization, one with profoundly disturbing parallels to Nazi Germany, and hereit is necessary to allow Sauder to speak to this possibility in his own words: > I will simply observe that many people absolutely disappear in this country> every year, never to be heard from again. No bodies are found, no trace of> them ever surfaces. I don’t know where these people go; I don’t know what> happens to them. I can offer no proof that any of them are held in secret> underground prisons. I cannot even offer proof that there are secret> underground prisons. However, it occurs to me that at the end of WW II many> German citizens were surprised to find out that there were concentration> camps, run by the Nazis, in which millions of their neighbors (Jews, Gentiles,> Gypsies, mentally-impaired, homosexuals, political prisoners) had been> incarcerated, tortured, forced into slave labor—and killed.28The possibility is more than disturbing, since former Reich Armaments MinisterAlbert Speer himself records a deliberate kidnapping project of the SS—over andabove the Nazi genocide—to round up suitable slave-laborers and test subjectsfor its deeply black projects.29What we have seen thus far—government and private corporate research facilities,whole vast underworld installations with all the amenities ofcivilization—strongly indicates that the infrastructure for a breakawaycivilization exists.b. The Rumored Tunnel System and Its Implications But part of the infrastructure of normal “surface” civilization consists in thefact that its centers are connected by a variety of communications links,including transportation links. Indeed, as Sauder notes, there has been foryears a persistent rumor that the various underground installations of this“underworld” are indeed linked by an equally hidden and underground system oftunnels, allowing vehicular traffic to flow smoothly, and unnoticed, between itscenters.30But does such a system exist?While there is no proof, there are a number of strong indicators that suggest itdoes. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the “United States military hadextensive plans to construct a very deep, hundreds-of-miles-long, undergroundtunnel system somewhere in the western United States,”31 in connection with itsMX-mobile ICBM system.32 Moreover, several Federal contracts were actuallyawarded for preliminary studies or actual site selection and excavation testingfor the system,33 an indicator that tunneling work went ahead for some otherpurpose, even though ostensibly the MX missile program was cancelled: > …the documents, articles and contracts…suggest it is entirely possible that> the military, working through the Ballistic Missile Office at Norton Air Force> Base, with the probable assistance of the Army Corps of Engineers and private> companies such as Robbins, Earth technology, and others, has secretly built an> extensive, very deeply buried tunnel system and nuclear missile complex,> somewhere in the United States, perhaps somewhere in the West.> If it has been made, this system may be, in its totality, hundreds of miles> long and thousands of feet underground. If it exists it is certainly very well> hidden. And if it exists it may very well explain either partly or wholly the> recurrent rumors in UFOlogy about a secret tunnel system in the southwestern> United States.34In my opinion, given the indicators thus far, and the detailed planning forcontinuity of government operations, it would seem very unlikely for such atunnel system connecting key installations, even if separated by hundreds ofmiles, not to be built.In Sauder’s opinion, this possibility raises, once again, the specter ofpsychological operations surrounding such facilities and systems, operationsdesigned, once again, to cloak their true function, and perhaps the technologiesassociated with them: > From the standpoint of disinformation there is another possibility: that the> military has really built a tunnel system of the sort described here, but has> tried to hide its existence under a tabloid-style cover story of alien> tunneling activities. According to this hypothetical scenario the military> would count on the “alien” connection to be sufficiently ridiculous in the> public eye that if word of the tunnels ever surfaced in the media they could> be discounted as the fevered imagining of daffy UFOlogists and other flaky> characters, and nothing more. In that way, the Pentagon could carry out its> underground agenda and prying eyes would be deflected by the threat of public> humiliation and ridicule.35Sauder is correct, simply because, as we have already indicated with Adamski andthe much more serious schemes of Skorzeny, plans were laid as early as World WarTwo to couple advanced technologies to a Sonderkampf, a special psychologicaloperation to socially engineer people’s perceptions. Only in one respect doesSauder perhaps miss the wider scope of the implications of the breakawaycivilization that his research implies, namely, that such operations may havetwo simultaneous goals: (1) to cloak its activities and implied technologies,and (2) to plant a meme within the culture that such technologies are “godlike”and “alien” to mankind, making its wielders commensurately “godlike.”c. Camouflage and Security This cloaking activity is a telltale sign of the possibility that one is dealingwith a breakaway civilization, and hence, we must now examine its othercamouflaging efforts, which include the actual camouflage of covert constructionmethods, through private or corporate proxies buying the land for suchinstallations,36 to the types of camouflage activity we saw associated with theNazi Zossen communications bunkers.37 Such camouflage “could literally be justabout anywhere: under a military base; under a major hotal; under a prominentgovernment build; under old, abandoned mine workings; under virtually anymountain or hill; under a national park, or perhaps in a national forest; in asmall town; or in the middle of a large city—maybe even deep under an Alaskanglacier.”38Allied to this camouflage effort is security, and a variety of means are nowcommon to gain access to these facilities, or, conversely, to preventunwarranted or unauthorized access, from quadruple belts of chain link fenceswith concertina wire and lethally electrically charged fences at the ManzanoMountain underground nuclear research and storage facility in Albuquerque,39 toretinal and palm print scanners,40 to a host of other security measures such asmotion detectors, armed security guards, and even mine fields.image [images/00038.jpg] Monzano Mountain, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Known to be Home to Miles ofUnderground Tunnels and Galleries for Nuclear Weapon Storage and ResearchThe implication of such security procedures, however, for the hypothesis of abreakaway civilization are often overlooked, for like all obvious things, it iseasy to do so. It is one of the functions of a government to secure the bordersof its society from other societies, and thus, such security procedures ineffect amount to a border, a boundary between two societies, and it will beevident that the distinction between a border between a government’s secretinstallations and its public society, and a border between two entirely separatesocieties, is very thin.d. The Nexus of Interests In the previous chapter, we observed the nexus between governmental structures,a political ideology (Fascism), and the private corporate world that constitutedthe unusual circumstances in which the breakaway civilization emerged. In thisrespect, Sauder makes the highly trenchant observation that this nexus is bestexhibited in the actual construction of the underworld infrastructure itself: > That nexus of interests was comprised of (a) big business; (b) military> agencies; and (c) private individuals who were in on the deal (and who very> likely benefitted from insider speculation in the local real estate market).> Underground base researchers would do well to look for this nexus of interests> and pattern of activity elsewhere, as similar groups are likely to have played> key roles in planning and constructing underground facilities…41In other words, the postwar pattern we saw emerging toward the very end of WorldWar Two is alive and well.e. The Implications of Doomsday and Continuity of GovernmentPlanning:The Apocalyptic Ideology There are a number of other parallels between the wartime Nazi model and thepostwar American one, notwithstanding their many connections to each other, notthe least of which is that many American think tanks, such as DARPA and the RandCorporation, appear to be modeled on SS General Hans Kammler’s “think tank,” theKammlerstab. Additionally, as Sauder astutely observes, most of theinstallations with which we have been concerned, have been either for thepurpose of secret research and technological development, or with gaming out,and preparing for, various apocalyptic scenarios, including nuclear war.42 Thisis an important point, for it means that in addition to having a “survivabilityinfrastructure” it also has an apocalyptic view of the future, which is coupledto the very technologies it possesses. This matrix of infrastructure,technology, and ideology is a powerful combination that could lead to aWeltanschauungskrieg in the fullest sense of the word, i.e., in the carefulpreparation of world-apocalyptic events through techniques of socialengineering, and then to the “fulfillment” of those created expectations via itsaccess to the technologies themselves via gamed-out and computer-testedscenarios. If this sounds farfetched or fanciful, recall the peculiarpronouncements of the Nazis in the postwar period, of Adamski, and of his ownsuggestive fascist connections and doctrines.f. Technologies of Tunnel Boring No survey of Sauder’s excellent research would be complete without a mention ofthe excavating and boring technologies he recounts in his book. And here, we aredealing, as we shall see, directly with the hypothesis of the possibility of abreakaway civilization. In a conventional tunnel excavating or boring machine, acylindrical machine has a cutting rotating head, in which are located severalsuperhard alloy drilling and grinding bits which dig into the rock. Thisexcavated rock, called “muck” in the trade, is moved by conveyor belts to theend of the machine where it is hauled away.43 The process, particularly throughhard rock, is costly, and time consuming.It should come as no surprise, however, that underworld installations for thesecret and covert research of advanced technologies should also investigateadvanced technologies for creating more such installations! Sauder cites a 1964Bechtel Corporation study in which new tunnel boring technologies are mentioned,including electrical disintegration, microwaves, electron beam guns, variousflame jet technologies, lasers, water jets, and, significantly, nuclearplasmas,44 about which more in a moment.(1) The Water Jet Boring Technology Before turning to the plasma boring technology, it is worth considering twoothers mentioned by Sauder. The pulsed water jet cannon “essentially grinds awaythe rock face by directing a high-pressure, pulsed, water jet against it.”45 Inother words, the water-jet boring technology is nothing but “high speed” or“time lapsed” erosion.(2) The Flame Jet Boring Technology According to Sauder, in 1968 United Aircraft Research Laboratories compiled afeasibility study of the possibilities represented by flame-jet excavation. Asenvisioned by the laboratory, the machine would advance on conventionalcaterpillar treads while directing very high temperature jets against the face.The jets would loosen and partially vitrify the rock while a conventional boringhead would drill and grind it away. The flame- jet method would leave a smoothwall,46 and it was estimated that it would save “from 44% to 28% of the cost ofthe drill and blast method.”47 But this was by no means the most exotictechnology envisioned, and perhaps manufactured, for the construction of theunderworld’s installations.(3) Nuclear Subterrenes and a NASA Study By far the most exotic tunnel boring and excavating technology was the “nuclearsubterrene” proposed and actually designed by the Los Alamos NationalLaboratory, whose scientists even filed a number of patents on the device, andthen, as Sauder quips, “the whole thing just sort of faded away. Or did it?”48These “subterrenes” work by applying the extremely hot plasma from a portablenuclear reactor to the dirt or rock face, actually completely vitrifying therock or dirt as it proceeds, “and leaving a neat, solidly glass-lined tunnelbehind them,”49 actually making it possible for these machines to bore tunnelsinto soil not normally considered safe for such tunnels, since the hardenedglass-like or ceramic-like walls left behind provide an natural reinforcement tothe structure in almost any conditions. Additionally, this process leaves no“muck” behind that must be carted away. The nuclear subterrene literally “slicesthrough rock like a nuclear powered, 2,000 degree Fahrenheit earthworm, boringits way deep underground.”50According to Sauder both the United States Atomic Energy Commission and theUnited States Energy Research and Development Administration took out patents onsuch machines in beginning in 1972 and a later one in 1975.51image [images/00039.jpg] Two Types of Nuclear Subterrene Boring and Excavating Machines52image [images/00040.jpg] 1975 U.S. Patent for a Nuclear Subterrene Excavating and Boring Machine53Some federal agencies, however, speculated on an exotic use for this exotictechnology, and here, it is best site Sauder for the implications of this use tosink in fully: > 1980s documents from Los Alamos National Laboratory and from Texas A&M> University (under contract to NASA) indicate that there are plans to use> “nuclear subterrene tunneling machines” to melt tunnels under the Moon’s> surface, to make living, working, mining and transportation facilities for a> lunar colony.> A 1986 Los Alamos report calls for using a fission powered, nuclear subselene> to provide the heat to “melt rock and form a self-supporting, glass-lined> tunnel suitable for Maglev or other high-speed transport modes,” The report> recommends burrowing beneath the surface because of the harsh lunar> environment. It further mentions that the tunnels would “need to be hundreds,> or thousands of kilometers long… ” The actual subselenes would be automatic> devices, remotely operated. In 1986, Los Alamos estimated each subelene could> be built for about $50 million and transported to the Moon for anywhere from> $155 million to $2.323 million… It should be noted that the report did not> specify how the nuclear subselenes and their crews would be transported to the> Moon.54Indeed, that is the mystery, for by the time of these plans, NASA had longabandoned the massive Saturn V boosters of the Apollo program, and had nosimilar deep space capability, having opted for the space shuttle system for lowearth orbit heavy lift capabilities.This implies three possibilities: > 1) NASA was conducting hypothetical studies for a future project when a deep> space launch capability was again operational;> 2) NASA had a hidden technology of deep space launch capability and was> conducting practical studies(or at least was aware of such capabilities in the> hands of some other agency or group); or,> 3) NASA was publicly stating “future possibilities” that had already begun.With respect to the latter two possibilities, Sauder observers that the TexasA&M study proposed a combination tunneling technology, using a conventionaldrill-and-grinding rotating head, but a nuclear plasma to melt the surroundingtunnel walls and then passing the remaining muck out the back,55 and then makesone more highly provocative remark: “The rest of the melted much(calledregolith) is passed out of the back of the tunneler and then carried to thesurface for disposal by the dump trucks that follow the tunneler through thetunnel.”56 For those who are unfamiliar with the name, an early space anomaliesresearcher, George Leonard, wrote a book in the 1970s—Somebody Else is on theMoon—in which, on the basis of official NASA photographs, he maintained that onecould detect precisely the type of “mining excavations” mentioned in the TexasA&M study.While I have always been extremely skeptical of Leonard’s book, analyticaltechniques, and conclusions, the combination of his claims plus the subsequentNASA sponsored study of the possibility of subselene lunar nuclear excavationdoes raise the possibility that these technologies were being developed not onlyfor the creation of an “underworld” infrastructure, but of an “overworld” one aswell.C. Conclusions and Reflections:The Obvious Things: Camouflage, Deception, and Security We are now in a position to summarize what this review of undergroundinstallations implies for the hypothesis of a breakaway civilization.Firstly, the facilities surveyed, both Nazi and American, indicate the creationof a physical plant and infrastructure capable of three of the crucialactivities of a civilization in Quigley’s inventory: manufacture,invention(research), and the creation of surplus.Secondly, the sheer enormity of these facilities, plus the possibility of theirinterconnection by equally hidden and underground means, implies that the nervecenters of this underworld are connected, just as in any ordinary society citiesand centers of commerce are connected.Thirdly, the measures taken to camouflage these facilities, by outrightcamouflage and by psychological operations techniques designed to cloak theiractivities and sew contexts within the core civilization for theirmisinterpretation, strongly suggest that we are, in fact, dealing with abreakaway civilization. Additionally, the security surrounding suchinstallations is commensurate if not identical to borders between societies ornation-states in the core civilization, indicating, again, that the strongpossibility exists that we are dealing with a breakaway civilization.Finally, the fact that psychological operations appear to be indicated inconnection with these installations and the advanced technologies they bothrepresent and research, plus the fact that they are connected with an inherentlyapocalyptic view of the future, a view which brought them into existence,strongly suggests that the ideological culture of this society or breakawaycivilization is different from that of the core civilization.But the careful reader would, here, strongly object, to certain assumptions madein this chapter, namely, the equivalence of a breakaway society with a breakawaycivilization. Indeed, he would be correct to do so. As we noted in the firstchapter, the essence of Richard M. Dolan’s idea of the breakaway civilization isits possible possession of a technology greatly in advance of that of the corecivilization surrounding it, and by implication, its suppression of theknowledge and existence of that technology. It is this final issue we must now,briefly, consider.image [images/00041.jpg] A Large, Conventional German Tunnel Boring Machine57Notes1 Caroll Quigley, The Evolution Of Civilizations, p.154.2 Farrell, Reich of the Black Sun, pp.102ff.3 Ibid.4 Ibid, pp.25-52.5 Farrell, The Philosophers’#x2019; Stone, pp.205-234.6 Hans George Kampe, The Underground Military Command Bunkers of Zossen,Germany: History of Their Construction and Use by the Wehrmacht and Soviet Army1937-1994, trans. from the German by Don Cox (Atglen, Pennsylvania, SchifferMilitary / Aviation History, 1996), frontispiece.7 Kampe, The Underground Military Command Bunkers of Zossen, Germany, p.12.8 Kampe, The Underground Military Command Bunkers of Zossen, Germany, p.13.9 Kampe, The Underground Military Command Bunkers of Zossen, Germany, p.22.10 Kampe, The Underground Military Command Bunkers of Zossen, Germany, p.21.11 Ibid., p.23.12 Kampe, The Underground Military Command Bunkers of Zossen, Germany, p.13.13 Friedrich Georg, Hitlers Siegeswaffen: Band 2: Star Wars 1947: Teilband B:Von der Amerikarakete zur Orbitalstation—Deutschlands Streben14 Ibid., p.35.15 George, Hitlers Siegeswaffen, : Band 2: Star Wars 1947: Teilband B: Von derAmerikarakete zur Orbitalstation—Deutschlands Streben nachInterkontinentalwaffen und das erste Weltraumprogramm, p.34.16 Richard Sauder, Ph.D., Underground Bases and Tunnels: What is the GovernmentTrying to Hide?

This preexisting project, known as Project Skyvault, was actuallyahead in achieving the goal of a manned antigravity craft.?Dr. Paul A. LaViolette1Paul A. LaViolette is a scientist who has researched and published on anextraordinary range of topics, everything from physics metaphors contained inancient and esoteric systems, to the non-random distribution of pulsarsthroughout the Milky Way galaxy when viewed from the Earth. He has alsopublished a superb, and supremely valuable, study of suppressed physics andtechnologies related to antigravity, Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion: Tesla,UFOs, and Classified Aerospace Technology, an indispensable guide for thoseconcerned with off-the-books physics and technologies.It is also, however, an indispensable book for a consideration of Dolan’shypothesis of a breakaway civilization and its technologies, for when itsinsights are combined with the wartime and postwar researches of the NaziInternational, and further, combined with our findings presented previously inthis book—namely, that the prewar corporate nexus between large German andAmerican corporations was reconstituted during and after the war, this time withthe Nazis thrown into the mix—then the picture that emerges is one ofcoordinated action to suppress public awareness of the physics being developed,and the technologies being engineered on the basis of that physics.We therefore assume, in this concluding chapter, the following things: > 1] that a relationship existed during the immediate postwar period, and> continuing at least through the 1950s, between the Nazi International and> American corporate and banking components of the “military-industrial> complex;”> 2] that each component constituted a crucial element within the matrix of the> breakaway civilization, that each component would wish to suppress any> competition—in line with its prewar cartel and monopoly ideology—and that this> means, effectively, that each component would take responsibility within its> own sphere of influence to suppress the public development and knowledge of> scientific theories and associated technologies that it itself was covertly> researching and developing;2> 3] that each component would also engage in psychological operations designed> both to conceal its activities and technologies, and to plant memes within the> broader culture leading to a context that would promote the deliberate> misinterpretation and obfuscation of its technologies; and thus,> 4] the “coincidental” emergence during the 1950s of contactee stories, the> postwar statements of Nazis, along with the “near simultaneous” and> “coincidental” disappearance of certain technologies and subjects from the> open literature, is not coincidental at all, but the coordinated action of> this postwar breakaway civilization and each of its components, pursuing> psychological operations, and suppression of pubic scientific inquiries and> areas of technological development it wishes to monopolize for itself.As we noted at the outset, the core issue in Richard Dolan’s hypothesis of abreakaway civilization is advanced technology, and the implicit idea that suchtechnology has been secretly advanced far beyond the technological level of opensociety, to such an extent that the covert bureaucratic infrastructureconducting this research has, in effect, become a wholly different type ofcivilization, with a wholly different scientific paradigm.But is there, in fact, such a paradigm? And if so, what are its implications?A. Suppressed Physics1. LaViolette’s Anecdotal Story There is indeed such a hidden paradigm, if one is to believe the statements ofthose involved with the black projects world, or those connected with itsecondhand. And there are deep sociological implications and consequences. Butbefore we can understand those implications and consequences, we need tounderstand exactly what has been said about that hidden underworld, anunderworld that includes not merely subterranean installations, but alsounderground concepts and paradigms.Dr. LaViolette recounts a story that, for him, opened a door onto thepossibility of a vastly different, covert, and off-the-books physics, one fardifferent from the “public consumption” physics learned in universities: > In 1992, I had an interesting telephone conversation with a man who is one of> the group of informants… whose stunning revelations about the B-2 bomber were> published in Aviation Week & Space Technology. Although he gave me his full> name, I will identify him as Ray for reasons of confidentiality. Ray claimed> to have worked on a number of black R&D projects and to have been in contact> with certain other black-world researchers. He told me that the physics> theories that academics and most laboratory physicists currently understand,> teach, and write about are grossly in error. A very advanced and much more> accurate theoretical framework has been developed by scientists of the> black-programs community, but its fundamentals presently remain classified.> From the standpoint of the new physics, modern physics concepts used in the> conventional world, such as relativity theory, quantum electrodynamics, and> quantum mechanics are referred to as “classical concepts,” that is, they are> treated as terribly outdated.3If true, LaViolette’s story is a strong indicator that an entirely differentscientific and engineering culture exists within the black projects underworld,than exists publicly, and this is a powerful argument that one is dealing, inclassic Dolan-esque fashion, with a breakaway civilization, in that it has anentirely different scientific ideology, and even, as we shall see subsequently,a unique sociology that results from its technological achievements.Indeed, LaViolette continues, giving a glimpse into what the nature of thatparadigm might be: > According to Ray, unlike today’s “Classical” physics, the new physics does not> begin with physical observables in developing its treatment of physical> phenomena. Rather, it postulates the existence of an underlying reality> consisting of an inherently unobservable subtle substance called an ether, or> alternativelyaether, which fills all space. It then defines all of its> fundamental quantities at that subphysical level. Physical observables then> emerge as mathematical solutions to equations defined in terms of these more> basic ether processes. This new physics regards time and space as absolutes> and views Einstein’s notion of relative time and space as fundamentally> incorrect.4Whatever the merits of this story—and one must always entertain the possibilitythat “Ray” was continuing in some sort of psychological disinformationoperation, giving just enough true elements along with a deliberate lie—a briefcloser look at the suggested physics is necessary.The first thing to be noted about Ray’s allegations is that the “off-the-books”physics deliberately dispenses with Einstein’s relativity theories, exactly asthe Nazi scientists working in the Reich?s black projects prior to and duringWorld War Two had done. In other words, the scientific, physics culture of thetwo worlds is, in this respect, exactly the same. This in turn argues plausiblythat some sort of Nazi influence continued to be felt within the Americancomponent of the breakaway civilization long after the war, a point to which weshall return in a moment.The point to be noted about Ray’s allegations is the return to the nineteenthand early twentieth century idea of an aether, a physical non-observable withcertain specific properties of information processing. And this leads us to afresh consideration of what I have referred to in previous books as a“topological metaphor” of the physical medium found in some ancient metaphysicaltexts.5 This should not surprise us, since the mathematical description of sucha medium would have to rely upon higher order topological languages to describeits processes.We may envision this physical non-observable, in mathematical terms, as theempty hyper-set, or ∅. At the outset, we note that it is a nothing, a physicalnon-observable, and thus, in the conceptions of the ancient metaphysical systemswith which the Nazis were so familiar, it is not only a nothing, but also aninfinity, neither definable, but paradoxically, a “countable entity”, a “One.”At this juncture, in quasi-physical terms, it is quanticizable, and yet, sincethere is nothing else, it is also a continuum.We then imagine that we bracket a certain region of this nothingness.Immediately when we do so, we have introduced a change into the system, andtherefore, introduced the notion of time. Simultaneously with this, we introducethree distinct “nothings” (notice how number itself arises from this process),the first region of nothing, ∅1, a new region of nothing, ∅2, and a common“surface”, itself a nothing, between the two: ∂∅1,2. (The partial derivativesymbol ∂ is used in topology to denote the surface of something). Thus, thetopological metaphor that I have outlined in previous books appears to be atleast similar to the notions that Ray described to Dr. LaViolette.6But there are other anecdotal evidences of the development of such anoff-the-books physics and technology from other sources, including, incrediblyenough, the statements of the former head of Lockheed-Martin’s Skunk Works, BenRich.2. The Curious Statements of Ben Rich:The Implications of Hidden Technologies and Hidden Physics7 Ben Rich, the well-known chief of Lockheed’s “skunk works,” the secretdevelopment facility responsible for, among other things, the development ofstealth technology and America’s F-117 stealth fighter, was born in Manilla, thePhilippines on June 18, 1925. Fascinated with aircraft and aircraft models fromhis youth, his family moved to the United States in May, 1941, in response tothe gathering war clouds with the Japanese Empire that would burst with suchsudden ferocity with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor later that year onDecember 7.Obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from UCLA in1950, Rich went to work for Lockheed’s Burbank facility as a specialist inthermodynamics, aerodynamics, propulsion, and design. By 1955, he had sodistinguished himself he was moved to Lockheed’s Advanced Development Projects,the “skunk works,” then under the capable and brilliant direction of Clarence“Kelly” Johnson, the man he would eventually replace. There, Rich worked on thedevelopment of Top Secret advanced aircraft, the high altitude U-2 and even moreexotic SR-71 Blackbird among them. When Johnson retired in 1975, Ben Richsucceeded him as the director of Lockheed’s “skunk works,” a position he helduntil his retirement on Dec. 31, 1990. Ben Rich died on Jan. 5, 1995, butbetween the time of his retirement and his death, he made a number ofastonishing public and private statements, the subject of our study here.a. A Catalog of Ben Rich’s Astonishing Statements For simplicity’s sake, we will catalog Rich’s statements, italicizing thestatement itself, and then providing the context in which each was made. > 1. “The Air Force has just given us a contract to take ET back home.” This> statement was made by Rich during a slide presentation he was giving on> September 22, 1992, at the United States Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio. It> is worth mentioning—though most readers will probably already be aware of it,> that Dayton, Ohio is home to Wright-Patterson Air Force base, reputedly the> place where recovered and alleged extra-terrestrial craft, including the> Roswell craft, and the Kecksburg craft, were initially taken for examination.> Wright-Patterson based the Air Technical Intelligence Command, Project> Bluebook, and a large contingent of Paperclip Nazis after World War Two.> 2. “We now have the technology to take ET back home.” This nearly verbatim> statement was made by Rich about half a year later, on March 23,1993, at a> lecture using virtually the same presentation as he made to the US Air Force> Museum the previous year. The presentation was made to the UCLA School of> Engineering Alumni Association.> 3. “We did the F-104, C-130, U-2, SR-71, F-117 and many other programs that I> can?t talk about. We are still working very hard, I just can?t tell you what> we are doing.? This statement was likewise made during Rich?s 1992> presentation to the US Air Force Museum.> 4. “We already have the means to travel among the stars. But these> technologies are so locked up in black programs, that it would take an act of> God to ever get them out to benefit humanity.” This statement was made during> Rich’s presentation in 1993 to the UCLA School of Engineering Alumni> Association.> 5. “If you can imagine it, Lockheed Skunk Works has done it.” This statement> was made by Rich to a small informal gathering at UCLA after his formal> presentation.> 6. “We have some new things. We are not stagnating. What we are doing is> updating ourselves without advertising. There are some new programs, and there> are certain things, some of them twenty or thirty years old that are still> breakthroughs and appropriate to keep quiet about. Other people don’t have> them yet.” This statement was made by Ben Rich to Popular Science magazine> reporter Stuart F. Brown in the October 1994 issue.> 7. “I wish I could tell you about the projects we are currently working on.> They are both fascinating and fantastic. They call for technologies once only> dreamed of by Science fiction writers.” Rich made this statement in> presentation to the AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]> on September 7, 1988 in Atlanta, Georgia.> 8. “We now know how to travel to the stars.” This statement, again, was made> during his 1993 UCLA presentation.And last, but not least, there was one final comment, and for our purposes as weshall see, it is the most significant one: > 9. “There is an error in the equations, and we have figured it out, and now> know how to travel to the stars, and it won’t take a lifetime to do it.” This> statement immediately followed number 8 above, and was made at the 1993 UCLA> presentation.In addition to these comments by Ben Rich, it is also worth noting that othersin the black projects industry made similar statements. Michael Schratt statesin his article that an unnamed Lockheed retired engineer was quoted in theFebruary 1988 issue of Gung-Ho magazine, in an article titled “Stealth andBeyond,” as saying “Let’s just put it this way… we have things flying in theNevada desert that would make George Lucas drool.”Schratt goes on to state: > The same Gung-Ho article continues with an earth-shaking comment made by an> Air Force officer who was involved in the development of the SR-71> (blackbird): “We are testing vehicles that defy description. To compare them> conceptually to the SR-71 would be like comparing Leonardo da Vinci’s> parachute design to the space shuttle.” One retired Colonel chimed in with the> following statement which also appeared in the same article: “We have things> that are so far beyond the comprehension of the average aviation authority as> to be really alien to our way of thinking.”All of these quotations lead Schratt to ask a very logical question: are they“veiled confirmation of the so-called ‘secret space program’”?b. Interpretive Possibilities Before we proceed to answer that most important question—indeed, the centralquestion posed by Rich’s remarks—we must examine the interpretive possibilitiessuggested by this catalog of remarks. Looking carefully at Rich’s statements,there are three broad classes into which they fall:> 1. Statements implying the general nature of a fantastic though hidden and> secret technology, with no indications of the capabilities or nature of that> technology (statements 3,5-7);> 2. Statements implying the general nature of a fantastic though hidden and> secret technology, with the clear statement that this technology is capable of> an interstellar capability (statements 1-2, 4, 8); and,> 3. A single statement implying that the Lockheed scientists found an error> “in the equations” that underwrites the fantastic technologies alluded to in> all the other statements. Note that Rich is specific, and speaks of an error> in thesingular, though he does not:> a. Specify the nature of that error, if it lies in the general philosophical> and physical assumptions or if it is of a more specific and formal> mathematical nature;> b. Specify which kind of equations he is referring to: the field equations of> electromagnetism, the tensor equations of relativity? We have no idea. Rich> does provide a clue, however, in that he refers to a single error in> equations, implying a set of equations describing a particular phenomenon.> This argues that the “singular error” may been of a generalized philosophical> nature that crept into the formalization of an entire set of equations.> c. We are now in a position to examine the interpretive possibilities that> Rich’s statements give rise to.> d. We may begin our examination by a bit of a thought experiment. Imagine we> are foreign agents infiltrated into each of Rich’s presentations to monitor> them, analyze and assess them, and report back to our home country. The first> and most obvious possibility that we must entertain is that Rich may be lying,> that he is stating things as a part of a psychological operation to make> America’ potential enemies think that the USA has technologies far in advance> of anything in any terrestrial arsenal. But as with every disinformation> operation, there must be a kernel of truth operating in order for the false> perception to take hold and influence decision-making.> e.

Consider only the U-2, the> SR-71 Blackbird, or the F-117 stealth fighter.

The Error in the Equations: A Hidden Physics and Secrets > f. It is in this context that our would-be agent and analyst will turn his> attention to the one piece of internal evidence that Rich gave as support for> all the other fantastic statements that he made, namely, that “There is an> error (singular) in the equations (plural), and we have figured it out, and> now know how to travel to the stars, and it won’t take a lifetime to do it.”> The context of Rich’ statement indicates that, whatever this error was, and if> genuine, it prevented mankind from traveling to the stars, and that fixing it> theoretically enabled that possibility. We may therefore rule out the> possibility that the equations in question are those dealing with standard> aerodynamic of lift, drag, and so on. Some other types of equations altogether> are implied.> g. Thus the question becomes: are there areas in which there are indications> of an error in the equations that would theoretically enable inter-stellar> travel? In other words, can one argue a prima facie case that Rich was telling> the truth here? And if he was telling the truth here, then are there> indications that an actual technology is being developed from that basis?As noted, Rich made his statement in the specific context of knowing “how totravel to the stars” and this means that the “error in the equations” cannot bein the form of an error in any of the conventional equations of aerodynamics,fluid flow and so on.In short, Rich’s statements imply that one has to reverse-engineer an entirehidden history of physics and electrodynamics, for they clearly imply that thereis such a history.This raises the whole point of secrecy and just how long advanced secrets may beclosely held and hidden from public view. Within UFOlogy the argument is oftenmade that secret human technology could not be that advanced from that in thepublic view, nor would it have remained classified for so long. But the clearimplication of Rich’s statements is quite the opposite, for he not only clearlyimplies the existence of such technology but that it is so deeply secret that ithas remained so for decades; he is also implying a hidden physics. The questionis, when was “the error in the equations” known and why were the scientistslooking for it?d. Maxwell’s Equations As I have pointed out in many of my published books, the original form of JamesClerk Maxwell’s equations unifying electricity and magnetism were originallywritten in a geometric language known as quaternions. But additionally, when oneturns to the literature of those physicists who are increasingly dissatisfiedwith the standard models, one finds other criticisms, even of their standardformulation in the partial derivative form learned by most students of physics,and as they were revised by Oliver Heaviside.One of the most trenchant observations of such problems was noted by thephysicist Thomas E. Phipps, Jr., in an excellent book entitled Old Physics forNew, a highly mathematical work. There he notes two crucial things, namely, thatMaxwell’s own formulation of his theory does not adequately take intoconsideration sink motions, but only source motions, but more importantly, notesthat induction is mathematically misrepresented by one form of equation (partialderivative form] when another form alone adequately accounts for the changingshape of circuit parameters that is being penetrated by a magnetic flux.8 Whileall this may seem abstruse and incomprehensible, it basically boils down to thefact that in the quest for mathematical formalisms that are “beautiful,”physicists essentially abandoned observation for the pursuit of theoreticalbeauty.In the context of Rich’s statements then, and their implication that there wasan error in the equations, it is likely that the Lockheed engineers discoveredthis very simple mathematical change, one that, in effect, did away with the allimportant observer of the effect, in this case, the effect being theelectromagnetic field itself.9 In this case, the circuit parameters, only fullydescribable by the change in notation from partial to full derivative form,function as the physical observer of the field effect; change the parameters ofthe circuit, and one changes what is observed. And that, of course, means thatcircuit parameters directly affect the local engineering or observation ofspace-time, exactly was was stated by the electrical engineer GabrielKron.10Physics, in other words, went very early astray by means of this change.So from the standpoint of Rich’s statements, two conceptual and philosophicalerrors were introduced because of this change of mathematical languages: (1) thechange from quaternion geometry to linear algebra lost the idea of anon-translational stress in the physical medium, a stress that might conceivablybe manipulated for an “antigravity” effect, and (2) the change from partial tofull derivative form lost the observer - the circuit parameters - and the directeffect these had on the field to be observed.In other words, even on this short and necessarily cursory examination, one needgo no further than the parameterizations of Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetismto discover two major changes in the mathematical formalisms of the theory thatstrongly support Rich’s contention that “there was an error in the equations,”an error making possible a technology to take us to the stars.Those changes in the formalisms of the theory would, of course, lead to furthertheoretical developments, including, of course, Einstein’s Special and GeneralRelativity theories, and the subsequent attempts in the 1920s to formulateunified field theories between electromagnetism and gravity. But if the firstfoundations of electromagnetic theory were themselves vitiated by two seeminglyminor changes in the mathematical formalism, then this would mean that many ofthe assumptions and parameters of the theoretical edifice built upon them alsowould have to be revisited and rethought from the ground up. For the moment, itneed only be noted that, given this analysis, it must be concluded that Rich wasnot simply stating something untrue, nor stating a piece of disinformation tomislead the public, other scientists, or engineers. His statements must be givengreat weight because the actual history itself suggests that such errors weremade. The history is known and commented on by physicists willing to break withaccepted dogmas and examine the history of the theoretical edifice (often atgreat cost to their own careers).This fact, plus the fact of the other statements Rich made, leads me to concludethat Lockheed’s engineers not only discovered these and similar errors, but thatthey went on to work out a new, hidden, off-the-books theoretical structure ofphysics, and to begin the engineering of actual technologies based upon it. Weare, in other words, looking at the possibility of an actual, practical, fieldpropulsion technology, utilizing electromagnetism in a practical way to achieveantigravity effects.3. Quigley Again:The Sociology of Weaponry and the Implications But what does all this imply for the hypothesis of a breakaway civilization? Thefirst, and most obvious, thing is that we are in fact dealing not merely with abreakaway society, i.e., with a rogue group at more or less the same pitch ofdevelopment as the civilization it is breaking away from, but with acivilization with a distinctively different science and technological matrix,and that in turn imposes its own sociological organization.Here we must once again return, for a brief moment, to Dr. Carroll Quigley. In abibliographical appendix accompanying Quigley’s Evolution of Civilizations,William Marina notes that > At the time of his death, Quigley was at work on a study which had occupied> him for years and which might be called the sociology of weaponry; that is,> the way in which the structure and development of civilizations are to a> considerable extent a reflection of the weapons systems and military> organization prevalent within a society.11Marina notes that drafts of this study, almost two thousand pages long, wereamong Quigley’s papers remaining at Georgetown University.12A few weeks before his untimely death, Quigley spoke to this subject in alecture to the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown: > Also related to the problem of internalized controls is the shift of weapons> in our society. This is a profound problem. I have spent ten years working on> it throughout all of history, and I hope eventually to produce a book if I can> find a publisher. There will be endless analyses of Chinese history and> Byzantine history and Russian history and everything else, and the book is> about nine-tenths written, I’d say, in the last ten years. The shift of> weapons in any civilization and, above all, in our civilization, from shock> weapons to missile weapons, has a dominant influence on the ability to control> individuals…> In our society, individual behavior can no longer be controlled by any system> of weaponry we have. in fact, we do not have enough people, even if we equip> them with shock weapons, to control the behavior of that part of the> population which does not have internalized controls. One reason for that, of> course, is that the twenty percent who do not have internalized controls are> concentrated in certain areas. I won’t go into the subject of controls. It> opens up the whole field of guerilla resistance, terrorism, and everything> else; these cannot be controlled by any system or organized structure of force> that exists, at least on the basis of missile weaponry. And, as I said, it> would take too many people on the basis of shock weaponry. We have now done> what the Romans did when they started to commit suicide: we have shifted from> an army of citizen soldiers to an army of mercenaries, and those mercenaries> are being recruited in our society, as they were in Roman society, from the> twenty percent of the population which does not have the internalized controls> of the civilization.13This requires careful parsing.First, it is to be noted that Quigley is not speaking of the breakawaycivilization, but of the core western civilization—the one most of us are livingin—and of the sweeping sociological changes that shock weapons, i.e., automatedweaponry from machine guns to precision munitions, have introduced. His point isthat such weapons have so drastically expanded firepower that it would require ahuge force to be armed if the twenty percent of the population that “lackedinternalized controls” were to revolt.Secondly, this fact, plus the fact that strategic weaponry—in Quigley’s time,thermonuclear weaponry—is useless against such a contingency, has led to theemployment of that very population “lacking internalized controls” as the coreof its military, in order to head off a social crisis, and to use the militaryas a means of social engineering.Weapons technology, in other words, creates certain conditions of governmentaland social organization. In the case of a society possessing the advancedphysics and technologies of antigravity, it is inevitable that it would producecertain sociological and cultural attitudes, since, as Adamski’s “ETs” warned,weaponized gravity would potentially greatly and exceed the destructive power ofthe largest thermonuclear weapons, and require new sociological structures,among them, the need to restrict access to such technologies to prevent themfrom falling into the hands of those lacking “internalized controls.” Quiteliterally, it would, from the ideological standpoint of that American-Fascistmatrix, require the development of a breakaway civilization, the semi-permanentbifurcation of human society defined along the lines of the types oftechnologies to which each component has access.And what are these “internalized controls”? For Quigley, they represent theconstraints of conscience and moral development, oftentimes formed by religion.In a post-modern world, however, such constraints are increasingly underassault, and have to be replaced by something else. In this respect, it isintriguing to note that, both in Adamski’s case, in the case of the impliedpsychological operations associated with advance technologies, and in the caseof Skorzeny’sWeltanschauungskrieg, it appears that the strategy adopted was tocouple the appearance of advanced technologies with a modern, materialisticcounterpart to the threat of metaphysical and spiritual evil standard in manyreligions, in short, with aliens or extraterrestrials whose intentions forhumanity are ambiguous at best.But this is not the only activity that a breakaway civilization would evidence,the other, as alluded to previously, would be to monopolize its control oversuch technologies, and thus, to suppress information about them, and thescientific principles upon which they are founded, from the general public.While volumes could be written about this entire subject, we shall concentratehere upon three unique cases, and the less-than-coincidental pattern of theoccurrence of their suppression in the 1950s. In doing so, we are stronglysuggesting that the occurrence of contactee allegations, the statements ofPaperclip Nazis concerning the “extraterrestrial presence,” and the suppressionof certain types of physics experimentation, were the coordinated activity ofthis breakaway civilization to protect its research and development monopolyover these advances.B. The Less-Than-Coincidental Pattern of the 1950s:Anti-Gravity, Richter, and Townsend Brown 1. The Tesla Precedent Most people are aware that the banker J.P. Morgan suppressed Nikola Tesla’sWardenclyffe Project for the wireless transmission of electrical power.14 Whatneeds to be underscored here is that this is the first documentable case of theinterference with the invention of new energy technologies by the Americancorporate and banking interest we have surveyed previously. This pattern will berepeated, with a vengeance, during the immediate postwar period and extendinginto the 1950s, as we shall now see.2. Project Skyvaulta. Nick Cook on the 1950s “Coincidence” The curious disappearance of the subject of antigravity discussion during the1950s was first brought to light by Jane’s Defence Weekly consultant andaerospace journalist Nick Cook in his highly-acclaimed Hunt For Zero Point, andit is worth recalling what he stated about the matter: > In 1957, George S. Trimble, one of the leading aerospace engineers in the US> at that time, a man, it could safely be said, with a background in highly> advanced concepts and classified activity, had put together what looked like a> special projects team; one with a curious remit.This, just a year after he started talking about the Golden Age of Anti-Gravitythat would sweep through the industry starting in the 1960s.So what went wrong?> In its current literature, the stuff pumped out in press releases all the> time, the US Air Force constantly talked up the ‘vision’: where it was going> to be in 25 years, how it was going to wage and win future wars and how> technology was the key.> In 1956, it would have been as curious as I was about the notion of a fuelless> propulsion source, one that could deliver phenomenal performance gains over a> jet; perhaps including the ability to accelerate rapidly, to pull hairpin> turns without crushing the pilot and to achieve speeds that defied the> imagination. In short, it would have given them something that resembled a> UFO.> I rubbed my eyes….. The evidence was suggesting that in the mid-1950s there> had been some kind of breakthrough in the antigravity field and for a small> window in time people had talked about it freely and openly, believing they> were witnessing the dawn of a new era, one that would benefit the whole of> mankind.> Then, in 1957, everyone had stopped talking about it. Had the military woken> up to what was happening, bringing the clamps down?15Indeed, articles on antigravity research were fare for the mainstream mediathroughout the 1950s, even making the front page of the New York Herald Tribunefor Sunday, November 20, 1955, and notably, the article refers to George S.Trimble, Jr., at that time “the vice-president in charge of advanced planning ofMartin Aircraft Corp.”16b. The 1955 New York Herald Tribune Article In confirmation of Cook’s hypothesis that the discussion of the subject in openliterature was suddenly and deliberately terminated, the New York Herald Tribunearticle begins with an astonishing revelation: > The initial steps of an almost incredible program to solve the secret of> gravity and universal gravitation are being taken today in many of America’s> top scientific laboratories and research centers.> A number of major, long-established companies in the United States aircrafts> and electronics industries also are involved in gravity research. Scientists,> in general, bracket gravity with life itself as the greatest unsolved mystery> in the Universe. But there are increasing numbers who feel that there must be> a physical mechanism for its propagation which can be discovered and> controlled.> Should this mystery be solved it would bring about a greater revolution in> power, transportation and many other fields than even the discovery of atomic> power. The influence of such a discovery would be of tremendous import in the> field of aircraft design—where the problem of fighting gravity’s effects has> always been basic.17The article mentions specifically Dr. Charles T. Dozier, a scientist withGeneral Dynamics, and of course, George S. Trimble of Martin, as well as Dr.Vaclav Hlavaty of the University of Indiana, as being involved in some of thisresearch.18But then the article gives an astonishing revelation, and a clue to the mysteryearlier alluded by Ben Rich, namely, that there was an error in the equations,and also alluded to by Dr. LaViolette’s source, “Ray,” who maintained that theoff-the-books physics began not with observations, but with a series ofequations of the non-observable medium. Here are the article’s bombshells: > Martin Aircraft has just put under contract two of Europe’s leading> theoretical authorities on gravity and electromagnetic fields—Dr. Burkhard> Heim of Goettingen University, where some of the outstanding discoveres of the> century in aerodynamics and physics have been made and Dr. Pascual Jordan of> Hamburg University, Max Planck medal winner whose recent work was> called:‘Gravity and the Universe’ has excited scientific circles throughout> the world.> Dr. Heim, now professor of theoretical physics, at Goettingen and who was a> member of Germany’s Bureau of Standards, during World War II, is certain that> gravity can be overcome. Dr. Heim lost his eyesight and hearing, and had both> his arms blown off at the elbows, in a World War II rocket explosion. He> dictates his theories and mathematical calculations to his wife.19Now we must pause to consider these bombshells in detail.c. The Implications of Burkhard Heim and Pascual Jordan’s Presence in TheseProjects The first point to be noted is that the presence of Dr. Vlaclav Hlavaty and Dr.Burkhart Heim indicates that the American corporate components of this breakawaycivilization were investigating theories of the unification of gravity andelectromagnetism that were hyper-dimensional theories, in that both men werethen proposing such theories.The second point to be considered carefully is the presence of Burkhardt Heimand Pascual Jordan in these efforts of American aerospace corporations todecipher the code of gravity.As I detailed in The Philosophers’ Stone: Alchemy and the Secret Research forExotic Matter, Burkhart Heim’s theory is an unusual departure from thethen-regnant standard model of physics in several respects, and here it isnecessary to cite my remarks and quotations there at length: > …Heim did not reject one fundamental insight of Einstein, both in his General> Theory of Relativity and more importantly, in his subsequent versions of the> Unified Field Theory, namely, that physical forces could be described> geometrically. Thus, forces not only were functions of the geometry, the> geometry was the forces. But there is one crucial insight to Heim’s version of> the theory, borrowed from the standard model of quantum mechanics, and that is> “the two important ingredients that Einstein did not use,” namely “a discrete> spacetime and a higher dimensional space, provided with special, additional> features.”20 Thus, Heim’s theory is a logical extension of the insight of> quantum mechanics and the various Unified Field Theories of the 1920s and> 1930s in that all physical interactions are described as geometries, and in> the crucial insight that space-time itself is quantized, that is, that it is> built not of ever smaller infinitely divisible units, but of discrete> “smallest possible” units of space and time.21> Thus, Heim’s theory is not only a “completely geometrized unified field> theory” but it is one with profound implications, for it gives rise “to a> novel concept for an advanced space transportation technology, permitting, in> principle, superluminal travel.”22 This unification is accomplished, in its> extended version, by an 8-dimensional quantized “and spin-oriented space.”23> As a result, its predictive power is enormous, for it not only predicts> fundamental particle properties such as masses and lifetimes,24 but also that> “a transformation of electromagnetic wave energy at specific frequencies into> gravitational like energy is possible.”25> In coming to this view, Heim followed the principle of General Relativity and> universalized it. In General Relativity, matter bends space-time itself, or,> to put it differently, matter is a “bend” in the fabric of space-time; “matter> and space-time curvature are equal.”26 Since the geometry and matter itself> are equivalent, and to that extent, since matter is caused by the geometry of> space-time distortion, then the essence of Heim’s Theory is that every> physical interaction or fields including gravity, electromagnetism, and the> strong and weak forces of quantum mechanics are distortions in what otherwise> would be a non-distorted undifferentiable space-time. Heim first presented> this view “in 1952 at the International Congress on Aeronautics in Stuttgart,> Germany,”27 a date rather close to the end of World War Two, and not without> its own suggestive implications, as will be seen. Heim further formally> developed these ideas in the first versions of his theory during the late> 1950s and early 1960s, the precise period in which Leonard Cramp’s book> appeared, outlining his views for the first time to an English-speaking> general public.> …> This insight leads in turn to the next fundamental component of the extended 8> and 12 dimensional versions of his theory. Dröscher and Häuser present this> aspect of his theory in the following manner:> According to Heim, the whole universe comprises a grid of Metrons or metronic> lattice. Space that does not contain any information consists of a discrete> Euclidean grid… However, empty space must be isotropic with regard to spin> orientation. If all metronic spins of a 6D volume pointed outward or inward,> such a world would not have a spin potentiality. Therefore, cells with all> spins outward have to have neighboring cells with all spins inward and vice> versa. This alternative spin structure satisfies the isotropy requirement, but> provides empty space with spin potentiality…. Thus empty space is void of> physical events, but has inherent potentiality for physical events to> happen.28In other words, the normal void of space itself, absent any informationdistortions such as mass or matter, is a pure potential for “things to happen,”it is the transmutative medium of the ancients. As a void it is anon-differentiated nothing, since there is a balance of spin orientations in allits cells.It is thus when that balance or equilibrium is unbalanced and enters intonon-equilibrium, where a preponderance of spin orientation of one or the othertype prevails, that all physical interactions, and all matter, arises.Non-equilibrium and spin are the very mechanisms not only for thedifferentiations of creation, but therefore are also the very mechanisms of theunification of physics, or, to put it in alchemical terms, for the “em-bodiment”of the medium itself within normal matter. Thus, Heim’s theory incorporates andcorroborates the fundamental insights of Jordan and Kozyrev, for particlesthemselves for they are “geometrical entities that possess an internal structurewhich is changing cyclically in time…Elementary particles are not pointentities, but do consist of Metrons.”29 Thus, in a sense peculiarly parallelingsome ancient views, “space and time are not the container for things, but are,due to their dynamic (cyclic) nature, the things themselves.”30 In Heim’s hands,this dynamic view leads to a truly extraordinary cosmology, because the higherdimensional space is composed of such a lattice of “metrons” there are no“singularities” or infinities that plague the standard models, and that have tobe gotten rid of by the fancy mathematical accounting trick ofrenormalization.31 The universe thus began as a single metron covering itsentire surface (the undifferentiated medium), and as the number of metronsincreased, their size decreased.32In short, the spin-orientation and active force characteristics of time itselfis the fundamental pillar of Heim’s theory.If all this is beginning to sound familiar, hold on, there’s more.In the 12-dimensional extension of Heim’s original theory, there are > five semantic units, namely, the subspaces R3 (space), T1(time), S2> (organization), I2 (information) and G4(steering of I2) where superscripts> denote dimension. Except for the 3 spatial dimensions, all other coordinates> are imaginary. Several metric tensors can be constructed from these subspaces…> Analyzing the metric tensors acting in R4, the theory predicts six fundamental> interactions, instead of the four experimentally known ones.33These two additional interactions are the basis behind the claim that the theoryholds out the promise of a breakthrough in physics and in propulsion and energytechnologies.The first of these reactions, a weak gravitationally repulsive action, which isanalogous to the standard model’s “dark energy,” Heim calls by the peculiar term“quintessence,” a term with its own alchemical associations, as has been seen,and thus perhaps suggestive of influences at work on Heim’s thinking other thanthe purely physics-related, namely, the alchemical. But there is also a“gravitophoton” reaction that “enables the conversion of electromagneticradiation into a gravitational like field.”34It will have been noted by the careful reader that Heim’s hyperdimensional spaceit actually comprised of five sub-spaces, one of which is our normal threedimensional space. Put differently, our three dimensional space is influenced bydistortions in the higher nine dimensional space composed of its sub-spaces,recalling esotericist Manly P. Hall’s observation that the successful confectionof the Philosophers’ Stone must be realized by one operation occurringsimultaneously in four separate worlds.It is precisely Heim theory’s prediction of a directgravitational-electromagnetic coupling that Dröscher and Häuser propose as thebasis “for the novel space propulsion concept” that will be presentedmomentarily.35…Taking as their point of departure a series of experiments sponsored jointly bythe European Space Agency and the U.S. Air Force, Dröscher and Hauser summarizethe experiments and its implications as follows: > In a recent experiment (march 2006), funded by the European Space Agency and> the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Taimer et al. report on the> generation of a toroidal (tangential, azimuthal) gravitational field in a> rotating accelerated (time dependent angular velocity) superconducting Niobium> ring. IN July 2006, in a presentation at Berkeley university (sic), Taimar> showed improved experimental results that confirmed previous experimental> findings. Very recently, October 2006 and February 2007 the same authors> reported repeating their experiments employing both accelerometers as well as> laser ring-gyros that very accurately measured the gravitomagnetic field. The> acceleration field was clearly observed, and its rotational nature was> determined by a set of four accelerometers in the plane of the ring.> Since the experiment generates an artificial gravitational field, which is in> the plane of the rotating ring…it cannot be used as a propulsion principle. It> is, however, of great importance, since it shows for the first time that a> gravitational field can be generated other than by the accumulation of mass.36Again, the mention of superconductors recalls Hudson’s observations of mass lossanomalies in his strange material, and of physicist Hal Puthoff’s explanationsfor them.But note what Dröscher and Häuser conclude about the configuration of theexperiment: since the artificial gravitational field was generated in the planeof the rotation of the superconductor, and not in the plane parallel to the axisof rotation, no practical propulsive benefit could accrue from the experiment.And this, precisely, is where Heim’s unique theory steps in: > …(Theoretical) considerations obtained from (Extended Heim Theory) lead to the> conclusion that an experiment should be possible to generate a gravitational> field acting parallel to the axis of rotation of (a) rotating ring… and thus,> if confirmed, could serve as a demonstrator for a field propulsion> principle.37> > The authors then propose an apparatus for testing this hypothesis consisting> of two counter-rotating systems arranged, as per the predictions of Heim’s> theory, one on top of the other, exactly as I have conjectured was the actual> internal configuration of the Nazi Bell’s counter-rotating drums!38image [images/00042.jpg] Dröscher and Häuser’s Proposed Apparatus for the Testing of a Field PropulsionPrinciple in a Plane Parallel to the Axis of Two Stacked Counter-rotatingSystems > That this theory would predict so specifically such effects, within such a> short time after the end of World War Two, with its suspicious resemblance to> the actual proposed configuration of the Bell’s internal counter-rotating> drums, is suggestive that there is perhaps more in play in the formation of> Heim’s theory than meets the eye. And this is only confirmed by the mystery of> what sort of research Heim was actually engaged in during the war.39Now let us summarize what we have with respect to Heim’s theory: > 1) The theory begins with higher-dimensional definitions of a quantized but> fully geometrized space-time;> 2) The theory is able to make predictions from first principles concerning> the mass and spin properties of fundamental particles;> 3) The theory significantly departs from Einstein’s relativistic hypothesis> of a space-time continuum, and in this sense, Einstein’s theory may be viewed,> ala “Ray’s” revelations to Dr. LaViolette, as a “classical” theory;> 4) The theory is testable, and indeed, since it views space-time as a series> of cells with rotation moment or spin characteristics, and as such it bears> unique and direct conceptual relationships to the Nazi Bell project.In short, we are looking at the distinct, direct, and strong possibility thatHeim theory itself became the basis for the elaboration of the type ofoff-the-books-physics mentioned by “Ray” to Dr. LaViolette, and of an “error inthe equations” mentioned by Ben Rich, for it adequately fulfills the parametersoutlined by each man!So much for Heim, but what about Pascual Jordan?Here once again the story is very interesting, for Jordan was one of the seminalcontributors to the development of quantum mechanics, and additionally, anardent Nazi. But for our purposes, his significance lies also in an interestingcontribution he made to the development of the idea of a coupling betweengravity and electromagnetism: > It seems likely that yet another scientist played some role in this project,> although his name did not appear in the original interrogation protocols; his> unique works could constitute part of the theoretical basis of the> experiments. It’s about professor Pascual Jordan, one of the most outstanding> physicists of the Third Reich (whose career was as enigmatic as Gerlach’s!).> During the war he worked on a theory which described the phenomenon of> “separation of magnetic fields,” linking the isolation of magnetic fields with> gravitational effects. Shortly after the war it was “perfected” and combined> with the works of another scientist - presently it is known as the> Jordan-Thiry theory. It is considered as one of the most fundamental> achievements of the XXth century physics and Jordan was an almost certain> candidate to receive the Nobel prize in 1954. Eventually, however, he was> disqualified after his role during the war was revealed… the Jordan-Thiry> theory forms the basis to analyze relativistic plasma vortices…40Remember that point about plasmas, for we shall return to it shortly. For thepresent moment, again, it is critical to realize the value of someone likeJordan—in spite of his Nazi past—to the American program via his discovery ofcoupling effects between magnetism and gravity.It is to be noted, additionally, that the presence of these two Germanscientists—one of them, Jordan, an ardent Nazi—in these postwar Americanantigravity projects occurs a mere two years before the whole subject appears tohave gone deeply black.d. Skyvault We now return to the crucial research of Dr. Paul Laviolette. LaViolette alsomentions another source, and project in antigravity research, also dating fromthe crucial period of the late 1950s, Project Skyvault: > One evening in 1986, a friend and I went out for a beer. Like myself, he had a> keen interest in alternative, cutting edge science. The topic of our> conversation eventually turned to electrogravitics, and at this point my> friend shared an interesting story. He told me that during the late 1950s, his> father had worked as a physicist at the Rocketdyne Aerospace Corporation in> Southern California and had been involved in some sort of super-secret> antigravity research. At that time, my friend had been just a young boy. He> said his father normally told him nothing about what he did at work because of> an oath of secrecy he had taken, but one evening, after returning home from> work he had been unable to contain himself. Very exuberantly, he had> exclaimed, “We got it to work, we got it to work!” When my friend inquired> what it was that was made to work, his father drew him a picture showing a> lens shaped craft suspended in midair. He said, “We got it to lift off!” He> would not say anything more about it, but that moment stuck in my friend’s> mind and now he shared it with me. I knew my friend well enough to know that> what he told me was entirely genuine.41We will present more evidence in a moment why this story should be takenseriously, but for the present, it suffices to note that once again the crucialperiod of the late 1950s is singled out, this time by a completely differentauthor, as a period of deeply black covert research activity into antigravity bya major American defense contractor.LaViolette was later contacted by entirely different source, whom he identifiesonly by the name “Tom,” who corroborated details of this story: > The story he later told me about the Skyvault project was quite astounding. He> said that he first heard about it in the fall of 1974, when working for an> engineering firm in Texas. His supervisor, with whom he had come to be very> good friends, one day told him about a top-secret government project that he> had worked on between 1952 and 1957 while at North American Aviation, a> company that was later renamed North American Rockwell.

While it is not necessary to gointo the principles of phase conjugation here,43 we may effectively view thisprinciple to involve powerful microwave standing waves between a resonatorcavity on a presumed craft, and the ground, producing a propulsive lift.44But there are two other indicators of research into antigravity and thestructure of space-time that went deeply black during the crucial 1950s.3. Thomas Townsend Brown and His Statements in “Project Winterhaven” The name of Thomas Townsend Brown is well known to those researching therise—and sudden disappearance—of antigravity as a subject of discussion in openliterature. What most do not know are the curious statements he made on thesubject, statements that, when viewed within a very wide context, suggest thathis work was suppressed not only by agencies of the government and therefore,possibly by the breakaway civilization, but also by the American corporatecomponent of that entity.image [images/00043.jpg] American Experimental Physicist Thomas Townsend BrownThese statements occur in a formal research proposal drafted by Brown andsubmitted to the U.S. Government for consideration, a proposal composed in 1952,and officially entitled “Project Winterhaven: A Proposal for Joint ServicesResearch and Development Contract.”45Before looking closer at this project, we must understand what led to it. Brown,as most know, began experimenting with electrogravitics as a young man, when henoticed an effect that subsequently was named after him and his mentor PaulBiefeld: the Biefeld-Brown effect. When Brown would turn on the electric currentto a cathode ray tube, the tube would momentarily jerk in the direction of thepositive pole.Brown subsequently conducted a lifetime of work of this phenomenon, eventuallyconstructing disks of dielectric material and charging the leading edges ofthese disks positively, with the result that the disks would move more or lesssilently, with a faint hissing sound, in the direction of the positive polarity.This idea he patented in a 1960 patent for an “Electrokinetic Apparatus”.image [images/00044.jpg] Brown’s 1960 Electrokinetic Apparatus Patentimage [images/00045.jpg] Thomas Townsend Brown with one of his Electro-Kinetic DisksBrown was well suited to this type of research, serving in the US Navy duringWorld War Two, experimenting with degaussing technologies and radar, as well asbeing connected in the popular imagination with the alleged PhiladelphiaExperiment, an early attempt to render an entire ship invisible to radar viaelectromagnetic means.46 By Nick Cook’s reckoning Brown’s “curriculum vitae”from this period indicates that “there was no question that Brown was … wellplugged into the military’s research and development community, and that hisopinions were given great credit.”47 During the years of his research into thiseffect, Brown performed tests in France of his disks in high vacuum, eliminatingthe possibility that the propulsive effect was due to the creation of an ionwind in the atmosphere.But to resume his story, after World War Two, Brown moved to Pearl Harbor andagain resumed his research into the effect that he was now convinced waselectrogravitic in nature. At this juncture, Brown’s research during the periodfrom 1945-1952 is shrouded in obscurity, but at some point he moved from Hawaiito Los Angeles, and according to Nick Cook, established the Townsend BrownFoundation.48What is known is that once back in California, Brown’s foundation was paid “anunannounced visit by Major General Victor E. Bertrandis of the US Air Force.”49There, Brown performed demonstrations of his disks for the General, who wasimpressed with the results.50It was during this period that Brown made a formal pitch to the military to fundwhat he called “Project Winterhaven: A Proposal for (a) Joint Services Researchand Development Contract” of the phenomenon. The proposal was straightforward: > For the last several years, accumulating evidence along both theoretical and> experimental lines has tended to confirm the suspicion that a fundamental> interlocking relationship exists between the electrodynamic field and the> gravitational field.> It is the purpose of Project WINTERHAVEN to compile and study this evidence> and to perform certain critical or definitive experiments which will serve to> confirm or deny the relationship. If the results confirm the evidence, it is> the further purpose of Project WINTERHAVEN to examine the physical nature of> the basic “electro-gravitic couple” and to foresee and develop possible> long-range practical applications.> The proposed experiments are to be limited at first to force measurements and> wave propagation. They are to be expanded, depending upon results, to include> applications in propulsion or motive power, communications and remote control,> with emphasis on military applications of recognized priority.51Note that Brown foresees the results being applicable to communications, a pointto which we shall return shortly, but Brown specifically states in his researchproposal that the experiments and research organization established toexperiment in electrogravity should be divided into two basic tracks, oneinvestigating the use of the effect for motive purposes, and the other forcommunications.52Brown also makes the observation that such a coupling effect betweenelectromagnetism and gravity was first suggested in unpublished notes of SirOliver Heaviside in the late nineteenth century.53 In other words, Brown wasobliquely suggesting the same thing we have encountered elsewhere, that therewas a little-known history of such concepts in physics, concepts that may havebeen deliberately kept out of view. This, in fact, is stated clearly in theWinterhaven proposal, which notes that “In recent years, as additional data of aconfirming nature became available, the research has been associated withgovernment research projects of a highly classified status, and publication hasbeen precluded,”54 a statement that strongly suggests Brown himself was involvedin some of this research, and that also suggests that the chase for antigravitywas well underway in the early 1950s, even before the subsequent mid-1950sdisappearance of discussion of the subject in the open literature.In its review of his electrified disks, the Winterhaven Proposal document notesthat the disks contained “no moving parts” and that in atmospheric tests “theyemit a bluish-red electrical coronal glow and a faint hissing sound.”55Then comes a bombshell, which readers familiar with my previous books, ThePhilosophers’ Stone, Babylon’s Banksters, and The Grid of the Gods willrecognize instantly: > However, there are certain variable factors which are not completely> understood. For example, there are tidal effects apparently caused by the Sun> and Moon which influence to a small extent the power developed. There are> anomalous sidereal effects which seem to be related to the passage of the> Earth through diffuse clouds of cosmic dust or electrified particles ejected> from the Sun.56In other words, Brown, during his research, had apparently observed variableeffects on his devices that were dependent upon the relative positions of theSun and Moon and the output of the solar wind, results that sound very similarto what was noticed by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kozyrev,57 and variableeffects on solar coronal activity that were correlated to planetary positions,noticed by RCA engineer J.H. Nelson.58However, just a little later in the Winterhaven proposal, Brown states that hisearly experiments’ results “were surprising for the reason that they failed toreveal a directional effect with respect to the gravitational field of theEarth, but showed only a dependence upon the mass (m) of the electrifiedbodies,” an effect that “provided a theory for a gravitational drive virtuallyindependent of the gravitational field of the Earth.”59How would one reconcile these two statements, for obviously, Brown is guardinghis language? The answer seems to lie in the possibility that relative planetarypositions, moon position, and solar wind activity, are correlated in theever-changing electrodynamic nature of the solar system itself, and in thepossibility that these in turn also produce dynamic torsion effects. This, ineffect, is what Brown himself later states: “The tentative theory implies thatthe basic relationship between the electrodynamic field and the gravitationalfield is revealed ‘during the process of charging or discharging electriccapacitors.’”60 This coupling effect Brown also subsequently notes couldeventually “be utilized in a completely new method of wireless communication.”61This coupling effect, and the communications opportunities it presented, leadBrown to drop yet another bombshell, and again, it is one that readers of myprevious books will recognize: > At the outset, development of the electrogravitational communication system> obviously could provide a secret, almost wholly untouchable, channel for> classified military communications. Message transmissions could be put through> without breaking military radio silence, at a time when all electromagnetic> transmissions are prohibited. Due to the high penetrability of the> gravitational wave, communications could conceivably be maintained between> submerged submarines, between submarines and shore installations or between> bombproof shelters and similar underground installations without the use of> external wires.> …> Due to the tremendous momentary displacement of air and the gravitational> disturbance resulting there from, there is reason to believe that the> electrogravitational receiver may be one of the few devices capable of instant> long-distance detection and ranging of atomic bomb explosions.62Brown is suggesting, in guarded language yet again, that nuclear explosions sendout a longitudinal pulse in the medium (“instant long-distance detection andranging of atomic bomb explosions”) that is of a superluminal nature, and thatthis is a result of the momentary geometry created at the center of theexplosion, a geometry that couples electromagnetic and gravitational fields.It is worth pausing to note what Dr. LaViolette says about this phenomenon, forit once again takes us back to Tesla’s wireless transmission of power via a kindof “electro-acoustic” or electrical longitudinal wave via his “impulsemagnifying transformers”: > Superluminal propagation speeds have also been observed in atomic bomb tests.> Scientists working for the military have known since the early bomb tests in> the late 1940s that the electromagnetic pulse shock wave from a nuclear> explosion propagates outward at superluminal velocities when measured near the> explosion epicenter. The enormous energy released in the explosion accelerates> the fireball’s free electrons radially outward at a relativistic velocity,> generating a radially propagating shock pulse that, like a shock discharge> from…(a) magnifying transmitter, moves outward at superluminal speeds.63Brown’s Winterhaven proposal was ultimately rejected, and Brown made his way tothe Bahnsen Laboratories, where he continued his private investigations of thephenomena, including research into Adamski-style disks.But as Nick Cook points out, Brown’s subsequent association in the popularliterature with the Philadelphia experiment, plus the military’s rejection ofhis Winterhaven proposal, may not be as clear-cut as they seem, for hisassociation with the Philadelpia Experiment > helped to perform a very important function.> By 1980, it had managed to tip Brown over the edge; make him a wholly> discredited figure in the eyes of science.> That left me with the uncomfortable feeling that the story had been carefully> stage-managed. If so, why? And why so long after the supposed events had taken> place?64Cook is not just proposing a possibility, for Brown’s association with thePhiladelphia Experiment was first popularized in the book on the subject byCharles Berlitz and William Moore, both of whom had intelligence contacts,Moore, of course, eventually confessing that he had allowed himself to be usedas a disinformation agent within the UFOlogy community by intelligence agencies,thus strongly raising the possibility that he was acting as such when their bookcoupling Brown to the Philadelphia Experiment was written.This, for Cook, raises the possibility that when Brown proposed ProjectWinterhaven, that he, like the aerospace companies later openly discussingantigravity research in the popular media, were discussing things already underinvestigation by the military “until someone, somewhere, ordered them intosilence.”65 Additionally, while Brown’s project may have been rejected, some ofthe results of his years of research nevertheless ended up being, as Brownhimself stated in the proposal, “highly classified.”66 So what do we now have?Clearly, in Brown’s Winterhaven proposal, we have the strong suggestions thatthere are electro-gravitic coupling effects, effects that in turn are variableaccording to the locally changing geometries of the solar system, and that thesesmall effects are also directly tied to the geometries of nuclear explosions,suggesting in turn that their yields are variable with the same local systemgeometries.All of this leads to yet another suppressed project, this time, of a Naziscientist working in Argentina….4. Dr. Ronald Richter’s Argentine “Fusion” Project While I have written extensively elsewhere of the “controlled fusion” project ofNazi scientist Dr. Ronald Richter in Argentina,67 a brief review is in orderhere. After Juan Perón disclosed the existence of Richter’s project to controlthermonuclear fusion in 1951, boasting that Argentina had learned the secret ofthe hydrogen bomb, Perón, and Richter, were both roundly denounced in theworld’s press, and nowhere more so than in the American media, as frauds. As isnow known, Perón established a commission to investigate Richter and his claims,and placed the scientist under permanent house arrest in Buenos Aires, and theproject was dismantled.However, as I outlined in Nazi International, while this was taking place, theUS Air Force subsequently conducted secret interviews of Richter in themid-1950s, and learned that Richter was actually attempting to manipulate thezero point energy—Richter’s term!—through rotating and electromagneticallystressed plasmas involving lithium-7 reactions.The US Air Force’s review of Richter was ambivalent, with some scientists stillinsisting that his claims were fraudulent, but with others stating that Richterwas some sort of “mad genius” working two decades in advance of everyone else.The problem, as co-author Scott D. de Hart and I pointed out in The Grid of theGods, is that Richter knew of lithium-7 thermonuclear reactions, which threwofficial US explanations for runaway yields in its Castle Bravo nuclear testinto a cocked hat. The Castle Bravo test was, of course, the infamous hydrogenbomb test of the early 1950s whose actual yield far exceeded the pre-testcalculated yield. Scientists later offered the lame explanation that they hadnot considered that all the lithium-7 in the device would contribute to thereaction. Both Richter, and his Argentine scientist opponents, knew years inadvance of these reactions, which were fairly standard and well-knownthermonuclear chemistry.68Richter, in his interviews with the US Air Force, not only made it clear thatlithium-7 was a primary component in his experiments, but also indicated that itwas his opinion that plasmas accessed a cellular type structure in space—shadesof Burkhart Heim!—and thus could momentarily act as transducers of the zeropoint energy under the proper geometrical conditions.And Thomas Townsend Brown was saying essentially the same thing, and that thewhole coupling effect could also be used for propulsion and communication.And all of it, as George Adamski was talking to “extraterrestrials” about theplanetary federation and the dangers of weaponized gravity, and as Naziscientists involved with the Bell project were opining disingenuously about offworld aliens, went deeply black, all of it, consistent with the activity of abreakaway civilization trying to protect its secrets.C. Conclusions We are now in a position so summarize the results of this essay, and to projectsome speculations that seem warranted from those conclusions. > 1) Throughout this study, we have noted various efforts aimed at the> camouflage of its activity and research, from the construction of secret> facilities with disguised entrances, to the more subtle forms of camouflage> indicated by possible psychological operations designed to deflect attention> away from human development of the advanced technologies represented by> antigravity research;> 2) Additionally, we have noted that this civilization, like all governments,> is protecting its “borders” and security by monitoring access to its> facilities, which represent a “geographic” location that is scattered over the> earth, but that is largely underground;> 3) Additionally, we have noted that this civilization has all the> “instruments of surplus” noted by Quigley as being necessary for the> sustaining of a civilization, methods of surplus whose financing mechanisms> are largely covert, in the form of black budgets, and even more hidden,> through the connection with criminal activity connected with the drug trade, a> trade in turn heavily penetrated by some sort of postwar international Fascist> organization. It is thus entirely feasible that this latter source of> “surplus” represents a component of the breakaway civilization’s independence> from the host society;> 4) Moreover, we have seen that there is a tripartite structure of various> components to this civilization, composed of> a) private corporate and banking interests closely allied with the> Morgan-Rockefeller interest and the American aerospace development firms,;> b) the American military, and finally;> c) the prewar German cartels, most notably I.G. Farben, and subsequently the> Nazi party and the SS;> 5) Within this wider context, the significance of the Morgan suppression of> Nikola Tesla’s invention of wireless power transmission appears not as the> isolated case of suppression, but as the first significant private corporate> and banking example of the wider pattern of such suppression by all factions> and components of the structure;> 6) We note in particular that Thomas Townsend Brown’s elaboration of the key> concepts of “electrogravitics” closely parallels similar physics conceptions> elaborated by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kozyrev, and that both men’s> ideas were suppressed and deeply classified, giving rise to the possibility of> an off-the-books physics and technology arising from it, ideas corroborated by> statements of Ben Rich and others closely involved in advanced aerospace> research. We also note the similarity of these ideas to the types of open> systems physics discussed in connection with banking interests in Babylon’s> Banksters., and to what I have called the ancient “topological metaphor of the> medium”. This confluence of ideas, again, strongly suggests the possibility> that we are indeed dealing with a breakaway civilization, and one that may in> fact be very ancient in its ultimate origins.> 7) We note that, insofar as the Nazi and American components of this research> are concerned, the former began to investigate the antigravity possibilities> in the 1940s, whereas the American component appears to have begun in earnest> in the 1950s, possibly as a response to “catch up” with the former;> 8) The strong possibility thus arises that we are looking at the matrix for a> two-track space program, since the breakaway civilization appears to have> access to, and to have developed, advanced and very different physics> conceptions and technologies than the public sector;69> 9) Beginning with Adamski, the “meme” was very early planted that mankind> would have to surrender its independence and sovereignty as a safeguard> against weaponized gravity, and this raises the next possibility;> 10) Beginning at the end of World War Two, and specifically among the Nazi> component of the emerging matrix of the breakaway civilization, SS Colonel> Otto Skorzeny proposed a Weltanschauungskrieg or psychological operation> conceived in conjunction with the careful display of advanced technology.> Given the statements of Adamski, the Paperclip Nazis, and the emerging ET> mythos, and following the insights of Dr. Jacques Vallee, it would appear that> this operation was conceived not merely as a cloak for the development of the> technology, but also that the technology itself was perceived in an> alchemical, psychotronic fashion, as a means of altering human perceptions and> the ability to interpret aspects of the UFO phenomenon correctly, deflecting> such developments from a terrestrial to an extraterrestrial origin. This> raises the possibility that the technology was perhaps perceived to give the> potential for massive deception operations, such as staged ET contact or> invasion events;> 11) We have also noted that there are significant indications of yet another> component of a breakaway civilization, namely, a different ideological and> scientific culture prevailing secretly within it, utilizing paradigms of> science very different from the public consumption physics promoted in the> open host civilization, with the statements of Ben Rich being the most> prominent public admission of this possibility, a possibility further> corroborated by the presence of Nazi scientists Burkhart Heim and Pascual> Jordan in 1950s antigravity research undertaken by the American military. It> must be pointed out, once again, that the earliest public record of the> possibility of the emergence of a very different paradigm of physics is in> fact with the Nazi proscription of “Jewish physics,” i.e., the relativistic> paradigm of Einstein, a clear statement of a breakaway scientific ideological> culture. In the postwar period, with the manifest crimes of the Third Reich> and its many patent failures in various areas of science, this in itself could> afford the basis for an effective psychological operation of suppression of> those areas of successful development of alternative paradigms falling outside> the relativistic paradigm.> 12) The fact that such technologies give off strong radiations—some of them> which we have examined, in the microwave range—also had inevitable> neurophysiological effects, effects most likely observed by those researching> and developing these technologies. These effects would have included> disorientation and possibly even hallucination, and thus the idea may have> been born to use the technologies in psychological warfare operations.In short, I believe it is now clear that the possibility raised by Richard Dolanof a breakaway civilization is not only possible, but that the conditions existfor it to do so.Moreover, it would seem clear that various activities undertaken with respect toUFOs would seem to indicate that at least some of these are psychologicaloperations, one clear activity of civilizations in conflict with othercivilizations. This last statement indicates one final possibility, that onesingle most prominent activity of civilizations, hinted at by Quigley’s“sociology of weaponry,” namely, war.We have not, in this book, discussed the war-making powers and possible actualwars of this breakaway civilization for the very simple reason that this, initself, would require a book of its own. But the fact remains that war is one ofthe principal organizing principles of any civilization, and this raises yetanother prospect and possibility. The waging of an actual war would be theclearest sign that this civilization exists. But what would one look for?I believe the answer was hinted at in the second chapter, and by Adamski’s “ET”himself: one would look for the signatures of a weaponized electrogravitics. Inthe scheme of things, one would be looking for a technology able to manipulatephenomena on a planetary, or possibly even stellar, scale.The Russian astronomer Kardashev proposed a classification scheme forcivilizations based on their abilities to manipulate energies. A Type 1civilization would be capable of manipulating and engineering the energies of anentire planet. A Type 2 civilization would be capable of doing the same withstars, and a Type 3 civilization, the most advanced, would be capable ofmanipulating those of an entire galaxy.Given what we have encountered in this chapter, it is clear that the physicsbeing proposed by Brown and others is capable of at least type 1 or 2manipulations, and this would mean the breakaway civilization is truly abreakaway civilization in yet another sense as well, for as the larger worldwallows in fossil fuels and all the economic- and geo-politics thereof, it wouldhave literally pulled away from that civilization in its technologicalcapabilities. The possibility of such engineering and manipulation raises theprospect that such technologies could reasonably be disguised as naturalactivities; after all, Mother Nature provides the perfect “plausibledeniability.”All this to say that such capabilities would be most manifest in the types ofmilitary operations it was able to mount. One would have to look for certainthings, reading the tea leaves of recent events, and ascertaining if thesignatures of those events evidenced the types of physics being outlined here.Is such a war being waged, covertly, right under our noses?Unfortunately, that possibility must await its own exposition. Here it sufficesonly to recall that Colonel Skorzeny proposed it …near the end of World War Two.Where that war has come since the 1950s would require another volume, for ifindeed that breakaway civilization is waging a war against the rest of humanity,or if there is covert warfare between its various factions, then it wouldrequire a close examination of the technologies, their signatures, and thesituations in which they may have been used.That is the task for another work. For the moment, it is clear that thepossibility of a breakaway civilization exists, and moreover, given theactivities and relationships we have surveyed, it is in my opinion a likelihood.Notes 1 Paul A.

By givingimage [images/00046.jpg]t thedefinition of the resultant set with the three members, we are in effect alsostating that time, in this mathematical method of analysis, is not a scalar, asit is in most systems of mathematical physics. Such a method would also tend tosuggest that the complex verbal systems of natural languages, which approachtime in a complex series of systems interrelationships, is capable ofmathematical formalism. We might equally describe such an approach as a kind of“hyper-relativistic” approach, since one of the emergent properties of thisinformation-processing and algorithmic approach is that ∅, both in this initialstate and first differentiation, is non-local, as is the treatment of timeitself. It is here that I have some difficulty with some of the statements “Ray”made to LaViolette, for in my own private experiments with his type of approach,the possibility does emerge of locally relative time dependent on the frame ofreference of the physical observe and the local “rotation moment” of space time.To put it succinctly, one is dealing with a “both-and” situation, not an“either-or” one.7 This section originally appeared as a members’ only “white paper” on mywebsite, www.gizadeathstar.com [http://www.gizadeathstar.com].
