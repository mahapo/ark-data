Ancient advanced technology.Artificial moons. Miscegenation, genetic engineering, and chimeras. The Face onMars. Out of place artifacts. And last but surely not least... ...Atlantis.For most people, these things are unrelated. But for me, the sense has alwayslingered in the corners of my mind that they were and are somehow all connected,that they are all somehow part of one “something,” components of oneall-encompassing scenario, a scenario of epic historical and indeed cosmicproportions.Readers of my Giza Death Star trilogy will already be familiar with my weaponshypothesis for the Great Pyramid, and be aware as well of the scenario advancedthere that some very ancient and sophisticated weapon of mass destruction mighthave been used to explode the now missing planet(s) of the solar system wherethe asteroid belt now orbits our sun, grim remnants and reminders of someancient planet “Krypton.” And most readers of that trilogy will likewise beaware of the fact that I believe the Great Pyramid - or something similar andbased upon similar “scalar” physics conceptions - might have been the weapondeployed to do it.But it is to be emphasized that there are massive problems with thisall-encompassing and highly speculative scenario, and readers of that trilogywill be aware of some of them. Needless to say, many of these problems arechronological in nature. But there are other equally weighty problems, and Ideliberately left these unexplored in the Giza Death Star trilogy, leaving themfor another book: this one.My reason for doing so was rather simple: I thought that to burden those alreadytechnical books with a lengthy examination of the scenario of an ancientinterplanetary war and its ongoing consequences would detract from the mainemphasis of those books, since such a scenario, while pertinent to the WeaponHypothesis of the Great Pyramid, is not necessary to it. The Giza Death Starbooks focused on the type of weaponry used to fight the war, and secondarily onthe war itself as corroboration that such weaponry once existed. Here thesituation is the converse. Here the focus is on the war itself, and secondarilyon the type of weaponry used to fight it as corroboration that such cosmic warsin local space were once fought.But what are those “other problems”?These may be understood by asking a very simple set of questions: Who foughtthis alleged war? Why were they fighting? What weapons did they use? What weretheir effects? Who won? Who lost? Who survived? What was their legacy? Andperhaps most importantly, who were the “good guys,” the “bad guys,” and why werethey “good” or “evil”?Thus, unlike in my Giza Death Star trilogy of books, the emphasis here is on thescenario itself, on the scenario of an ancient interplanetary war in our ownsolar system and on its prolonged perhaps even contemporary consequences. Thereare, of course, implications for the hypothesis explored and outlined in theGiza Death Star trilogy, and accordingly, some of the material of those books isreprised and expanded upon here, but only insofar as it is necessary to explorethe scenario itself. Therefore, the reader should bear in mind throughout thefollowing pages that the two hypotheses- that of an Ancient Interplanetary War and that of Great Pyramid as a Weapon ofMass Destruction — remain separate hypotheses. They dovetail, to be sure, butthey do not stand or fall together. Indeed, as the reader will eventually learnin the main body of this work, there is some textual evidence to suggest thatwhatever weaponry was once associated with Giza may in fact lie in an olderstratum beneath the current structures at Giza, and that the present GreatPyramid may be an attempt to reconstruct a much older weapons technology ofhegemony. It will also be apparent that other types of weaponry than scalarweaponry, or other modes of deployment of scalar weaponry — which is mypreferred view - may have been used, not only to blow up planets and othercelestial bodies, but to leave fantastic searing scars on others, to manipulateweather, and even to manipulate consciousness itself.Readers of the Giza Death Star books will likewise recall that the hypothesis ofa Very High Civilization in “extremely ancient times” - named “paleoancient” inthe Giza Death Star trilogy by my intentionally redundant term — was a broadcomponent of the scenario outlined in those three books. In this book, myoccasional use of the term “Atlantis” is to be understood as a symbol for thatVery High and paleoancient Civilization. Accordingly, I do not intend onentering into lengthy discussions of the location of the celebrated “lostcontinent” other than in those instances where the topic is germane to thesubject under discussion. As has been seen in The Giza Death Star trilogy, thereare significant reasons to take Plato’s story of a “lost continent” in an“allegorical” sense, in the sense of a “myth” with multiple layers of meaning,from the prosaic literal sense to carefully crafted “paleophysical” ones.Thus, inevitably, we are led back to the subject of “paleophysics.” The GizaDeath Star trilogy contained much discussion of the speculative possibility thatthere once existed a sophisticated “paleophysics” in that paleoancient Very HighCivilization, a physics as sophisticated, if not more so, than our owntheoretical and practical edifice of quantum mechanics, relativity, string andmembrane theory, or alternatively, loop quantum gravity, plasma cosmology, andso on. Such a view had to be advanced if one was to seriously entertain what theancient texts themselves suggested, namely, that such weapons of massdestruction existed in very ancient times, and that they were associatedsimultaneously with the destruction of planets on the one hand, and with thecapabilities of pyramids in general and the Great Pyramid in particular.Here the discussion of an ancient paleophysics is renewed and expanded upon.Readers of the first book of that trilogy, The Giza Death Star, will find herean expansion on the plasma physics and cosmology of Swedish physicist and Nobellaureate Hannes Alfvén. Additionally, readers will also find additional materialon Tom Bearden’s “scalar” or “quantum potential” physics as well, conceptionswhich were discussed in The Giza Death Star Deployed, The Giza Death StarDestroyed, and most recently in my book on the Nazi secret weapon project knownas “the Bell”, The SS Brotherhood of the Bell.With all this being said, a further cautionary note is also necessary. In orderto tie together all the disparate pieces that I believe may form components ofthis gigantic scenario of cosmic war and catastrophe, of giants and chimeras, of“gods” and men and Nephilim, it is essential to paint in very broad strokes.While I do entertain discussion of broad chronological and other scientific andarchaeological considerations, I do not enter into lengthy examinations ofdisciplines related to and affected by the Cosmic War hypothesis, such asevolutionary biology, anthropology, or even theology, philosophy, comparativereligion, and esoteric or occult history. That such fields are affected by thishypothesis should be obvious. But to discuss each of these implications indetail would not only require several lengthy tomes in their own right, it wouldalso distract attention from the main themes of the scenario as exhibited by theabove questions. To ignore them altogether, however, would be equallyprecarious. Accordingly, I have only sparingly indicated such implications insynoptic form either in the main text or in footnotes, when I think it isappropriate to do so.Similarly, I do not attempt to reconstruct a whole detailed chronology of analternative “pre-history” of extraterrestrial contact, intervention, war, and soon, as does Zechariah Sitchin in his Earth Chronicles series, for a very simplereason. The Cosmic War hypothesis has not hitherto been adequately advanced orexplored in its own right, so it would seem best to ascertain its very broadoutlines and progression and to put them forward here as a kind of prima faciecase, and then to work out the detailed chronology at some later point. It mayindeed be the case that eventually chronological data, once the frame into whichthey may be set has been erected, may be easily placed into it. Or it maylikewise be the case that such data may completely overturn the frameworkproposed here. Similarly they may suggest an entirely different framework of thebroad progression of the war than the one I suggest here. In any case, theemphasis here is to outline the Cosmic War Hypothesis and its supportingtextual, physics, and archaeological evidences in as broad a fashion aspossible.Consequently, the Cosmic War scenario as outlined here remains, like the GizaDeath Star weapon hypothesis, a hugely speculative hypothesis. It is mostdecidedly not a theory. If it is at all true as a theory, then its predictivepower must lie in the fact that it will predict the occurrence of distinctlyartificial artifacts on nearby planetary bodies in our own solar system, andperhaps of very ancient artificial satellites of planets as well. Additionally,it will “predict” the occurrence of evidence indicating deliberate targeting anddestruction of these artifacts and satellites. And finally, it will “predict”the necessity of observers to record this information in the various forms thathave come down to us, albeit in garbled form. But history, much lessreconstructions of paleoancient history based on mythological texts, is notscience for the very obvious reason that its “predictions” are always of an aposteriori nature, and thus the cosmic war hypothesis can remain only ahypothesis. Corroboration can only come in the total context of externalevidence adduced to support it.The existence of observers highlights one aspect of the interpretive problemsassociated with this hypothesis. As will be seen in the main body of this work,human myths and legends abound with details of the “wars of the gods” and thehorrendous weapons with which they were fought. As such, one must either (1) optfor the “naturalist” and “materialist” interpretation of such myths alongcatastrophist lines, or (2) posit the tremendous antiquity of man in a timeframe lying quite beyond the pale of standard cultural history, evolutionarytheory, anthropology, and paleontology in order for there to be observers of theevents that the texts describe, or (3) one must posit a precursor race orspecies somehow tied to humanity, which bequeathed to mankind its ownobservations of this war and catastrophe, which then became the nuclei for thesehuman myths and legends. As will be evident in the main body of this book, themyths themselves point to this third alternative as their own favoredexplanation. But any way one views this problem, one has stepped quite outsidethe pale of the standard academic models of history, evolution, andanthropology.It must therefore be frankly and bluntly acknowledged that this work isaccordingly not one that would be accepted in any academic context. It merelymakes a case for looking at these myths as containing real elements ofhistorical and scientific truth in yet another way: that the “wars of the gods”were real, that they engendered planetary destruction and catastrophe here onearth and elsewhere in the solar system, and perhaps even outside it, and thatsome of the consequences may still be with us in ways that we scarcely imagine.Similarly, the cosmic war hypothesis is not likely to be met with muchenthusiasm among certain strains of revisionists either. At one end are thecatastrophists best exemplified in the work of Alan Alford and many others, forwhom the whole matrix of conceptions in the complex of symbols used by myths arenothing more than a metaphor for naturally occurring explosions of planets. Thecosmic war hypothesis is, needless to say, antithetical to this wholeenterprise. At the other end of the spectrum is the disturbing tendency in somuch alternative literature to paint this putative paleophysical past inidealistic terms, as a golden age, a warm and fuzzy “Disneyworld” of “jonquilsand daisies” devoid of nasty bad things like interplanetary wars and theirassociated technologies. However, such an attitude simply flies in the face ofthe overwhelming preponderance of “cosmic war” traditions from all over theglobe. And this brings us to the nature of the evidence itself.Careful consideration of the questions outlined above, and of the parameters ofthe “interplanetary war scenario” itself, will also reveal the types of evidenceto be considered in this work: (1) physics, (2) the material evidences ofanomalous artifacts, (3) evidences and mechanisms of planetary destruction, (4)evidences of possible deliberate targeting and destruction, and finally, and byno means the least important, (5) textual and “legendary” evidence from texts,oral myths and traditions, and physical monuments and ancient glyphs. “Text” inother words is understood in this book in the broadest sense, as being inclusiveof all these things.Finally, a word about how the term “war” is to be understood in this work. Whenone normally thinks about this word “war”, one conjures images of trebuchets,tanks, and triremes, of ballistas and bombards, of cavalry and cannon, ofships-of-the-line and steel-clad armored dreadnoughts, of armies, fleets, andmore recently, vast aerial armadas and mushroom clouds, particle beams, highenergy lasers and grasers,2 all clashing and often annihilating their enemies.In short, one naturally imagines all the associated technologies of war. It isno different, as we shall see, with the ancient texts. There too, the ancienttexts conjure images of generals, admirals, political leaders, of heroic deedsand despicable acts, of the suffering of the innocent, wanton destruction ofproperty, and most importantly, a technology capable of the most contemporaryinterpretation of extreme sophistication. The ancient texts, as does recenthistory, conjure images of city-wide devastation, and of the as yet (andhopefully) only theoretical regional destruction that might follow even the mostlimited nuclear and thermonuclear exchange. As will be seen in the remainder ofthis work, I certainly believe the cosmic war scenario to include these aspectsof “war.”But there are also more subtle forms of warfare, such as when a “vanquished”party goes underground to wage a “guerilla war,” complete with secret cells,passwords, means of recruitment, propaganda and psychological warfare and allthat these things entail. These, too, are included in my use of the term “war”.Consequently, I mean the term “cosmic war” in a truly “cosmic” sense inclusiveof its spiritual aspects and ongoing nature, for as any careful consideration ofthe texts will demonstrate, this war possessed the characteristics of an ongoingguerilla that from time to time erupted into wholesale open hostilities. And asthe texts also indicate, some of the “people” who fought this war, or theirdescendents, may still be around. In this respect, “war,” also includes theunderlying concept of the civilization fighting it. So in examining the cosmicwar hypothesis, we are also examining the underlying civilization and its mores,and this fact may indeed by why the hypothesis has never been adequatelyexplored by the two strains of revisionists previously referred to, for itthrusts the philosophical question of theodicy to the fore, a question totallyavoided by catastrophism which is but a variant of materialism, and by thegolden age warm fuzzies and Disneyworld “jonquils and daisies” approach, whichis but a variant of wishful thinking.In fact, as I suggested in my book The GiZa Death Star Destroyed,, thepaleoancient war was not only the fertile seeding ground for the many versionsof catastrophism (including that version which views it as a regular cycle), butalso the soil that germinated and nurtured the ancient mystery cults andeventually the secret societies and priesthoods that succeeded them. The “cosmicwar,” as many religious traditions - especially the Judeo-Christian - havealluded, is an ongoing one. But as will become equally clear, that lattertradition may itself have erred somewhat by viewing that “warfare” as anexclusively “spiritual” or even “personal” one, without considering thepossibility that it was also a very real war in a very real cosmic sense foughtin very real places by very real persons who possessed very real technologies.It is, after all, only our modern outlook that opposes the spiritual and thephysical, but such an opposition would have been foreign to the ancient frame ofmind, and would seem to be at complete variance with the broad sense of theChristian tradition’s own legacy of sacramentalism.One may perhaps now appreciate the magnitude of the task presently before us,for not only are so many disparate themes and subjects - as outlined in theopening paragraph - possible components of this scenario, but many discretetypes of evidence must be adduced and synthesized in a convincing fashion tosupport it. Consequently, on any number of levels the scenario may be rightlyand strongly challenged, from the weight accorded to different types ofevidence, to the interpretation put upon them, to the broad picture thatemerges, to the chronological - and more importantly spiritual and theological -questions it raises.For these reasons it must be reiterated - here, now, and in the strongestpossible fashion - that the highly speculative and indeed radical scenariooutlined here is only hypothetical, dwelling in that foggy gray area betweenancient science fiction, and the disturbing question “Yes, but what if it weretrue, even if only in parts?”When I first began this line of research and writing a few years ago with mybook, The GiZa Death Star, I included as an epigraph to the Preface of that booka statement allegedly made by the physicist Nils Bohr to his colleague WernerHeisenberg, one of the main architects of modern quantum mechanical theory, anddiscoverer of the Uncertainty Principle which is named after him. It seemsfitting to close this preface with that same remark, and to suspend it over thetotality of this work as a reminder of its radical and speculative nature: “Sir,we’re all agreed your theory is crazy. The question that divides us is, whetherit is crazy enough.”1[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1044518],2[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1044711] Joseph P.

Someurge that they deploy their gigantic region-busting hydrogen bombs en masse and,in a sudden, decisive, and massive strike, blow the enemy into a thousandpieces. Others weigh in against such a drastic move, reminding the Presidentthat the danger of a radioactive rain from such a move would be almost asdangerous as the threat itself.In Beijing, in similar bunkers, the mandarins of China’s burgeoning defenseestablishment argue with China’s premie r, Dang Mai Luk, for a more subtlecourse. Perhaps it would be just possible, they argue, to divert the attack withjust the right, precisely placed counterstrike to give it a slight “push” in theright direction, and thus avert the catastrophe. It is a classical martial artsapproach, one steeped in the Oriental tradition of warfare: the use of anenemy’s strength and mass against him.In Europe, defense ministers and heads of governments hastily summoned to Berlinby German Federal Chancellor Angeline Merkwurdigliebe urge an internationaldiplomatic effort in the United Nations Security council, warning of direpolitical consequences if any of the world’s powers should decide to deal withthe rogue attack unilaterally in an ill-conceived and hasty military response,while outside, Neo-Fascist skinhead groups protest, urging that Europe’s powersflex their considerable military and technological muscles and take out therogue, demonstrating to a grateful world that Europe was still a “player.”Inside, some delegates, acutely aware of the demonstrations outside, call for atechnologically sophisticated variation on the subtle Oriental approach: a“nudge,” a “warning shot across the bows,” not with the sledge-hammerthermonuclear approach of the Russians, nor the scaled-down nuclear nudge of theChinese, but with space-based lasers and other exotic directed energy weapons.Leading the charge for this approach are the four major European powers, France,Great Britain, Germany, and Italy. The rest of the European nations’ delegatesfidget and squirm nervously in their chairs, but ultimately acquiesce, for thereality of European geopolitics has not changed since the Franco-Prussian War;those four nations still possessed the bulk of Europe’s financial,technological, and military clout. Everyone else was, well, just along for theride.In the United States, an ad hoc presidential “blue ribbon panel” has beenquickly, if not quietly, assembled on the orders of President Jordan WalterSchrubb. The panel consists of the National Security Council, Pentagon generalsand admirals, various scientists, engineers, economists, and media experts.Typically, the panel weighs all the alternatives being discussed in the othercapitals, recommends all of them and none of them at the same time, urges“cautious but decisive action,” calling upon the State Department to mitigatethe political fallout of what will be perceived as “American unilateralism.” TheCongressional opposition meanwhile calls for hearings on why nothing was doneabout the rogue threat long before, since the United States government gaveevery indication of having known about it for several years, and of having donenothing to avert it. And in typical fashion, the Congressional opposition’s moreradical members produce their own retired military and scientific experts whoargue that the threat is no threat at all, that it will break up of its owninternal stresses long before it can do any serious damage. Even more radicalelements in Internet chat rooms and discussion groups go so far as to suggestthat the government had engineered the threat for its own benefit, or at theminimum was capitalizing on a heaven sent opportunity to expand its power. Butthe opposition is clear about one thing: no military action should be takenagainst the threat, since that could be used as an excuse to militarize outerspace.And there is a final player, a most unexpected one. In Sao Paolo, Brazil, asmall and elite cadre of generals, scientists, and cabinet ministers gather inthe president’s study over cognac and cigars, casually recommending that theBrazilian President offer to the concerned parties Brazil’s own quite uniquetechnology for dealing with the threat, a technology that has no need of the“gentle” thermonuclear nudge of massed hydrogen bombs nor of the moresophisticated obliteration of lasers, particle accelerators, or phased plasmacannon. The discussion is relaxed and cordial, having none of the sense ofurgent gloom that pervading the discussions in other world capitals.“The earth,” says one paleontologist in perfect and elegant Portuguese, “facedthis threat before, and all life was nearly exterminated. We are fairly certainthat the dinosaurs, at least, owe their extinction to it. But now we can dosomething about it, and need not face another such catastrophe. Mr. President, Iurge you to deploy the weapon, to make it available to the world, because we canbe quite certain that neither the Russians nor the Germans nor the Japanese willreveal their own possession of the weapon unless they absolutely have to, andeven then, we cannot risk the chance that they would not do so, and we cannotallow the Russians, Chinese, or Americans to make a thermonuclear strike.” TheBrazilian President nods in agreement, savoring his cigar. The “rogue threat” is a killer asteroid, larger than one kilometer in diameter,and it is on a definite collision course with the planet Earth in approximatelynine months’ time. When it collides, it will release the energy of 10,000megatons of TNT, one hundred times the magnitude of the largest thermonuclearbomb mankind has ever tested. It will throw into the atmosphere a choking cloudof dust, alter the earth’s climate in unknown, permanent and catastrophic ways,and possibly eliminate all life from the face of the earth."},{"pageContent":"A. KILLER ASTEROIDS AND THE EXPLODED PLANET HYPOTHESIS While the scenario outlined above may seem to be the farthest thing from thesubject of an ancient, lost, technologically advanced civilization, much less aninterplanetary cosmic war, it affords perhaps the best entry into a discussionof these subjects, for the scenario of a modern-day killer asteroid strike isbased on evidence of similar primordial strikes on the earth, one of which wasindeed believed to have been the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs, andthe rise of mammalian life ca. 65 million years ago. Such a scenario has becomea major concern of the militaries of the world’s technologically sophisticatedpowers. Yet another “minor” event ca. 3.2 million years ago coincides, accordingto the standard theory, with the rise of the earliest hominid ancestors ofmankind. These two dates, as will be seen, will become very crucial in thedevelopment of the Exploded Planet Hypothesis, and thus in the development ofthe Cosmic War Hypothesis.In the last two books of my Giza Death Star trilogy, The Giza Death StarDeployed and The Giza Death Star Destroyed, I referred to the scenario of anexploding planet in our solar system having been the victim of deliberatedestruction utilizing the enormous power of “scalar” or “quantum potential”weaponry. In doing so, I outlined the Exploded Planet Hypothesis of Dr. Tom VanFlandern. Since our focus is now on the scenario an ancient interplanetary waritself, his hypothesis must be outlined more thoroughly, in order to correct theinevitable inaccuracies that arise in presenting any short summary, as well asto understand his hypothesis and its implications for such a cosmic war scenariomore completely."},{"pageContent":"1. THE HISTORY OF THE EXPLODED PLANET HYPOTHESIS The history of the Exploded Planet Hypothesis actually begins in the eighteenthcentury with an unusual astronomical law known as Bode’s law, or the Titius-Bodelaw, named for the German astronomers Johann Daniel Titius and Johann EhlertBode who first proposed it. Basically, both astronomers noticed that thedistance of the planets’ orbits from the Sun fell into a neat harmonicmathematical progression. The progression may be obtained by starting with thesimple numerical sequence 0 1 2 4 8 16 32 128 256. Multiply this by 3 to get 0 312 24 48 96 192 384 768. Add 4 to this to obtain 4 7 10 16 28 52 100 196 388772. Setting the earth’s distance at “10” gives Mercury at 4, Venus at 7.2, Marsat 15.2, and Jupiter at 52.0, which is approximately in line with theprogression and with their actual orbits. But astronomers noticed that, by theprediction of the law, there should be a planet at the number 24 in theprogression, but there was none. The search was quickly on for the missingplanet. The modern exponent of the Exploded Planet Hypothesis, astronomer Dr.Tom Van Flandern, puts this history this way in his work Dark Matter, MissingPlanets, and New Comets:> The astronomer Daniel Titius notices a curious fact about the spacing of the> planets: each of the six known planets is roughly twice the distance of the> previous one from the Sun, with only one exception, a gap between Mars and> Jupiter. The gap is just the right size to hold one additional planet.> Astronomer Johann Bode publicizes the curious fact in 1778 as a “law.” Not too> much is thought of it until 1781, when William Herschel discovers the seventh> planet, Uranus, and it is found to be in excellent agreement with Bode’s law.> This draws attention to the gap and the missing planet predicted by the law.4> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1045363] The problem was quickly resolved, for on January 1, 1801 the Italian astronomerGiuseppe Piazzi “discovers the missing planet while observing.”5[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1045614] The new planetorbits the Sun exactly where the Titius-Bode law predicted it should. It wasgiven the name Ceres.But there was a further problem, and it was a significant one. The new “planet”was “incredibly tiny compared to the other planets, not even big enough to makea good-sized moon.”6 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1045759]The problem was quickly magnified when later that year yet another miniature“planet” was discovered in roughly the same orbital distance from the sun, andgiven the name Pallas.7[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1045896] Now there was notone, but two miniature planetoids, where there should only have been one largeplanet according to the Titius-Bode law, and both of these “planets” were noteven as large as moons.At this point, the German astronomer Heinrich Olbers proposed a bold new theoryto explain the phenomenon: “a larger planet had exploded!”8[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1046102] Thus, Olbers wasable to predict that more such miniature “planets” would be discovered in moreor less the same orbit, and “that they would vary in brightness as they spun,because fragments should be irregular in shape.”9[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1046247] The Exploded PlanetHypothesis was then expanded by the French astronomer Louis Lagrange in 1814 toexplain the origin, and the unusual and extremely elongated orbits, of comets,since these would be “natural byproducts of an explosion.”10[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1046384]However, unfortunately for Obler’s and Lagrange’s explosion theory, the wellknown and highly respected astronomer Laplace weighed in with “several tellingarguments” and discounted the theory.> The attack of this prestigious astronomer cast the planetary explosion theory> into disfavor for most of the next 175 years. Various new evidence and> arguments, pro and con, appeared in the interim, but the astronomers as a> whole were now committed to more conventional explanations. Even the> appearance of a definitive treatise on meteorites by Brown and Patterson in> 1948, in which they concluded there was irrefutable evidence that meteorites> were once an integral part of a larger planet, did not sway the bulk of the> astronomers.... who generally believed that the thousands of known minor> planets orbiting between Mars and Jupiter were the remains of a planet which> had never been formed, rather than one which had broken up.11> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1046523] Then, in 1972, the Exploding Planet Hypothesis was given a first nudge towardrebirth when the Canadian astronomer Michael Ovenden resurrected and revisedBode’s Law.Ovenden derived a much more elaborate mathematical formula than the originalTitius-Bode law, a new formula that not only “predicted the spacing of theplanets” but also “their major satellites.”12[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1046662] But that was notall.> (He) also came to the conclusion that a planet was missing from the area where> the minor planets orbited. But Ovenden predicted that it must have been a> giant planet the size of Saturn, and much larger than all the other planets> put together. This was an important possibility not previously considered. It> meant that the event which destroyed the planet must have involved enormous> energy. It also meant that much of the debris had been blasted out of the> solar system completely.13> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1046869] The enormous energy required for a planet to explode plus a plausible model forwhy they should do so is one of the most significant difficulties in theExploded Planet Hypothesis, as we shall see."},{"pageContent":"2. THE EXPLANATORY AND PREDICTIVE POWER OF THE EXPLODED PLANET HYPOTHESIS A. ASTEROIDS AND METEORITES However, notwithstanding the problem of the enormous energy required for aplanet to blow up, plus the additional problem of a plausible physical model bywhich such an event may be explained by natural causes, the Exploded PlanetHypothesis does possess enormous explanatory and predictive power, anexplanatory and predictive power that far exceeds those of the favored theorieswithin contemporary astronomy.For example, the hypothesis is more than an adequate explanation not only forthe occurrence of meteorites, but for some of their more unusual features:> Some of them show evidence of rapid melting a long time ago, as if they were> affected by an immense heat blast. A few show evidence of shock, others are> badly charred. Some meteorites display evidence that they formed in a> high-temperature or high-pressure environment, as in the interior of a large> planet; for example, tiny diamonds have occasionally been reported in> meteorites. And there is specific evidence of exposure to an event of enormous> energy, which conventional theory supposes to have been a nearby supernova.14> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1047032] Moreover, those bodies without an atmosphere in the “outer solar system arecoated with an extremely dark material. This may be the carbonaceous residuefrom the blast.”15[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1047246]Additionally, some ofthe moons of Neptune lie within the Roche limit “where tidal stresses would tearapart a forming body.” Remember this point about tidal stresses, for it willbecome crucially important in a moment. This means simply that these “moonlets”simply could not have been formed near their current orbits, but were the resultof capture, and the “exploded planet hypothesis provides a natural origin” forthis phenomenon.16 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1047394]And as for the presence of diamonds in some meteorites, this is not the onlyunusual feature of meteorites that the hypothesis helps to explain. Theirpresence in fact led some astronomers to propose novel and heretofore unknownmechanisms for their formation from “space collisions” or “during atmosphericentry or by Earth-impact shock” without the need for the sudden shock andhigh-pressure high-heat environment of a planetary explosion. But there existsone unshocked meteorite, named Abee, where none of these suggestions “can beoperative.” Moreover, there are diamonds found at the K/T geological boundary onearth (ca. 65,000,000 years ago) that “are confirmed to be of extraterrestrialorigin” and which therefore cannot be generated by earth impact.17[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1047541]Yet another unusual feature is explained by the hypothesis. Van Flandern puts itthis way:> Asteroids exhibit “explosion signatures” in the distribution of their orbital> elements. These relationships between the orbital elements “a” (semi-major> axis), “e” (eccentricity), and “I” (inclination) were first found among> fragments from artificial satellites of the Earth which exploded in orbit, and> then were found to hold for the asteroid belt as well.18> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1047689] The theory explains why some of these asteroids, which appear to have their owneven smaller satellites, even have such satellites at all, for “tidal forces andcollisions should have eliminated most minor planet satellites in far less thanthe age of the solar system, but not in a time as short as a few millionyears.”19 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1047897]In otherwords, the event that led to the formation of the asteroid belt, in which onefinds asteroids with their own tiny satellites, must have occurred in arelatively “recent” time as far as astronomical times go, in the last fewmillion years. As we shall soon discover, the timing of this event will assumeenormous importance both for the development of the Exploded Planet, and for theCosmic War, Hypothesis.B. COMETS While the Exploded Planet Hypothesis was first formulated by Olbers to explainthe existence of asteroids, Lagrange soon found an even more interesting aspectof its explanatory power: it adequately accounted not only for the existence ofthe elongated orbits of comets and their large orbital periods, but it accountedadequately for their origin. It also accounted for another odd feature ofcomets, or rather, for an odd feature that has never been observed about comets.If one assumes, as contemporary astronomical theory does, that most cometsoriginate from a point beyond the planetary solar system, that is, from a pointbeyond Pluto, then one should expect that there is a class of comet, onhyperbolic orbits, that will take them into the solar system once, then back outof it, once, never to return. But no such orbits have ever been observed forcomets.20 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1048036]This raises the issue of the current standard theory for the origin of comets,the so-called “Oort cloud” and its corollaries. The Oort cloud is contemporaryastronomy’s accepted standard model for the origin of comets. This “cloud” isthought to be a region of “space debris” far beyond the orbit of Pluto, at thevery fringes of the solar system. At such distances, the debris is thought to beable to react to the gravitation of passing stars, which then more or less“kick” it into the wild orbits we observe as comets. But this theory should meanthat some comets are “kicked” into the hyperbolic orbits already described, andthese should “arrive at the rate of at least a few per century if comets havebeen interacting with passing stars for billions of years.”21[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1048183] But comets, as weknow, return. They may be recurrent pests, visiting every few decades or so, orthe occasional visitor stopping by once every few hundreds, thousands, or evenmillions of years. But the point is, they return, and if they return, then thereis a regularity and pattern to their orbits that is difficult for the Oort Cloudmodel to predict. It is here that the scientific priesthood stepped in with aquick patch to fix the leaky structure:> To minimize these difficulties it is now imagined that the Oort cloud comets> come form a hypothetical “inner core” between the planetary region22> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1048391] and the Oort> cloud. There is no observational evidence for such a region - it is simply a> theoretical construct. Then the inner core is fed by a hypothesized “Kuiper> belt” of comets of nearly circular orbits near the plane of the other planets,> beginning just outside the orbit of Neptune, which is supposed to have been> left over from the primeval solar nebula. Again, there is no observational> evidence for this region either, despite many intensive searches...23> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1048600] Thus, Van Flandern proposed a revival and revision of the Exploded PlanetHypothesis in 1978, since the origin of comets in the explosion of a planetwould explain the observed characteristics of their orbits “in an a priori way.”Moreover, the new theory proposed that the exploded planet, which was the originof comets, existed in a parent body “in or near the present location of theasteroid belt” and that this event had necessarily occurred “in the relativelyrecent past.”24 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1048747]Such a theory makes far more sense than an imaginary theoretical construct likethe Oort Cloud, with its recent “fix”, the Kuiper Belt, for yet another simplereason. In order for the Oort cloud theory to work, the “debris cloud” whichcomprises it has “to be immense in order to provide the few comets we observe,because the chances are so small of any one comet being perturbed intoobservable range.”25 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1048895]> In summary, the hypothesis that comets originated in a breakup event only a> few million years ago in the inner solar system makes a number of very> specific predictions: that there will exist a category of first return (“new”)> comets; that these will have huge aphelion distances with intrinsically very> little scatter; that they will come from preferred directions on the celestial> sphere with a specific percentage bias; that the number of orbits will> diminish as one looks closer to the Sun; that the distances and directions of> approach will be correlated; and several other characteristics.26> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1049103]> Thus,> > The exploded planet theory is the only dynamically viable alternative to the> > Oort cloud. The latter requires the existence of an implausible cloud of> > more than a trillion comets orbiting the Sun at distances 1000 times that of> > Pluto, so remote that passing stars would frequently pass through it.27> > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1049250]> > > The failure of this standard Oort cloud theory to detect any source for a> re-supply of the Oort cloud “from a hypothetical inner ‘Kuiper Belt’ means> that Oort cloud comets should have long since been depleted by passing stars,> galactic tides, and passage of the Sun....unless comets originated quite> recently.”28 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1049397] C. OTHER PHENOMENA EXPLAINED BY THE EXPLODING PLANET HYPOTHESIS Other strange solar system phenomena are explained by the hypothesis, not theleast of which is the strange hemispheric discrepancy observed on the Earth’ssatellite, the Moon, and its even stranger regions of anomalous “denser mass,”the well-known “mascons,” for> The Moon’s hemispheric asymmetry could have been caused by the blast. It would> then be no coincidence that the hemisphere with all the dark “seas” faces the> Earth, since the extra mass accreted by the Moon (which shows up as “mascons”> — mass concentrations under the lunar “seas”, which are actually lava flows)> would have caused the Moon to change its orientation until its “heavy side”> faced “down”.29 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1049550] Yet another odd feature explained by the hypothesis is that the orbit of Mars’moon Phobos will decay into Mars’ atmosphere “in about 30-40 million years,” afact which is explainable if Phobos originated about “3,200,000 years ago.”30[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1049758] Note now that onehas the first indicator of a more or less exact time that the explosion of themissing planet occurred. This will become quite the crucial point as we proceed.A loose corroboration of this timing is provided by the fact that the ratio ofhydrogen to deuterium on Mars indicates that the Red Planet’s “formerly abundantflowing water has been lost in just the last 105 to 107 years,”31[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1049906] that is, Mars lostits water between 100,000 and 10,000,000 years ago. This would mean that duringthe 3,200,000 years event, Mars may still have been a water-bearing planet. Yetanother loose corroboration of the 3,200,000 years benchmark is provided byJupiter and its massive gravity itself. While Jupiter’s mass “is insufficient tohave interfered with the formation of a normal planet” in the asteroid belt, itis sufficient to have “swept up almost all the mass from the exploded planetthat did not escape the solar system.” Even its excess heat “may be anindication of relatively recent mass accretion by the planet.”32[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1050053]D. THE TIMING OF THE EVENT: 3,200,000 YEARS AGO In its original version, Van Flandern was led by the preponderance of theevidence, especially the mathematical, statistical evidence based on cometaryorbits, to suggest that the explosion of the missing planet occurred some3,200,000 years ago. He describes what then occurred in very suggestive terms:> Let us go back in time three million years. On Earth, the dinosaurs became> extinct much earlier, land animals gave rise to the primates, and the earliest> ancestors of man have just appeared on the scene. Elsewhere in the solar> system everything is as we know it in the twentieth century, with one major> exception. There is one additional planet between Mars and Jupiter, larger> than any of the others except Jupiter itself. From Earth the extra planet is> bright enough to be seen in the daytime, and dominates the night sky with its> brilliance.> Suddenly, it explodes! Like a nova in our own solar system, it brightens until> it outshines the Sun itself. Solid, liquid, and gaseous debris is hurled into> space at high velocities in all directions. Nonetheless, it takes months for> the leading edge of the blast to reach the Earth. What a sight it would have> been for early man to see! The sky ablaze with meteors night and day> unceasingly for months.33> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1050696] Such an event, and its effect on the Earth and any observers on it, wouldclearly have been very dramatic, as Van Flandern suggests. More importantly, itwould have had an inevitable effect on the Earth’s geology and climate. Indeed,it is precisely around the same time frame, approximately 3,000,000 years ago,that the equatorial-like climatic conditions which are believed to haveprevailed on the Earth up until that time, suddenly changed to “a succession ofice ages over the past 3,000,000 years or so.”34[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1050926] While the mechanismfor such a sudden change is not known in conventional theories, a “massiveinflux of water vapor from the planetary explosion may have been responsible.”35[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1051074] Indeed, to theinflux of water vapor one would also have to add an influx of “debris” and“dust” that would have had atmospheric and climate-altering potential.So what do we know about the missing planet? “Ovenden’s dynamical calculationsindicate that a massive planet, perhaps Saturn-sized, is missing from the gapbetween Mars and Jupiter, where the main belt of asteroids is found.”36[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1051282] Since comets andasteroids also appear to be about 20% water,37[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1051430] we can now draw someconclusions:> 1. The planet was large, approximately the same mass as Saturn.> 2. The planet was solid, for diamond bearing carbonaceous asteroids appear as> the debris of its explosion.> 3. The planet was very likely a water-bearing planet, since Mars, exhibits> definite and distinct evidence of sudden, massive flooding across its entire> southern hemisphere. We may now speculate a bit further. If this planet was home to intelligenthuman-like life, it would seem to be likely that such life would have been ofmuch larger size, with more massive skeletal structure and musculature toaccommodate the higher gravity. In short, such creatures would be, by modernhuman standards, giants. Thus, the existence of any remains of such creaturesmight be explainable as having an ultimate origin on such a world, and wouldtherefore constitute corroborative evidence — of a very loose sort, to be sure -of the existence of such a planet.For the moment, however, let us return to Van Flandern’s hypothesis, and noteits problems, problems he himself ran into as he elaborated the theory."},{"pageContent":"3. PROBLEMS OF THE ORIGINAL EXPLODED PLANET HYPOTHESIS AND THE REVISEDHYPOTHESIS A. ASTRONOMY VERSUS GEOLOGY: THE CHRONOLOGICAL PROBLEM As noted, in its first formulation, Van Flandern proposed that the explosion ofthe planet occurred some 3,200,000 years ago. But this highlights a clash ofsciences, in this case, astronomy and geology.(1) VAN FLANDERN’S INITIAL RECONCILIATION Van Flandern first observed this problem and noted its difficulties in thefollowing fashion:> Such a major explosion should leave evidence all over the solar system, and> apparently has. Yet in the geological record on Earth, there is little to> support the hypothesis of a major explosion specifically at 3.2 million years> ago. There is evidence for the onset of a series of ice ages about then, after> a long span of tropical climate. And the origin of man dates to around then.> But one would have expected a global layer of carbon deposits, enrichment in> the element iridium, shocked quartz from impacts, multiple impact craters,> micro-tektites and micro-diamond formation, enhanced volcanism, atmospheric> and ocean changes, a single global fire, mass extinction of species, and many> other dramatic changes. Such things are seen in several places in the> geological record, but not near 3 million years ago according to the presently> adopted geo-chronology. Strikingly, all those features are seen together at> the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K/T) boundary, dated at 65 million years ago, when> the dinosaurs and many other species became extinct. The expectations from the> astronomical evidence and the realization in the geophysical evidence appear> to be identical except for dating. 38> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1051578] Astronomy and geology, in other words, agreed on the event, but were in profounddisagreement as regards its timing.Van Flandern’s initial reconciliation of this dilemma is worth citing at length:> Occam’s Razor virtually demands that the astronomical and geological events be> reconciled. This leads naturally to the conjecture that the geological time> scale (based as it is on radiometric dating, stratigraphy, magnetic reversals,> sea-floor spreading, and a few other techniques) may not be interpreted> correctly. For example, among the possibilities for such a drastic rewriting> of the geological record, the rocks that are radiometrically dated to 65> million years ago may indeed have formed at that epoch, but were perhaps only> deposited into the geological layers where we find then about 3 million years> ago.

I considered that> radiation from the explosion might have falsified the radiometric clocks in> rocks used for this dating.

So I then considered possibility that all rocks suitable for> radiometric dating originated on the planet that exploded, and simply mixed> with a large amount of inert terrestrial matter on impact. However, the> predicted discontinuity of radiometric dates at the K/T boundary under that> scenario is not observed.42> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1053038] Thus, for this and other reasons, Van Flandern was led to posit more than oneplanetary explosion, at different dates, to explain the geological record of theEarth, as well as to square the hypothesis with other types of evidence.(A) A SPECULATIVE RECONCILIATION OF THE 3,200,000 BC EXPLOSION WITH THE K/TGEOLOGICAL BOUNDAY LAYER DATA By now it is apparent that Van Flandern initially favored a planetary explosionaround a mere 3,200,000 years ago, since this was where the preponderance of theastronomical and mathematical data led him, and yet, this could not beconveniently reconciled with the geological data on the basis of the models heinitially proposed.But in my opinion, he may have abandoned the 3.2 million years ago date as themain event a little too quickly, for another mechanism would seem to beavailable to explain the relative absence of confirming geological debris on theEarth for such an explosion at that date. It is possible that this explosiontook place when the Earth was at or near its farthest point from the explodingplanet. In such a case, it is conceivable that the shock wave and debris fromthe explosion of the planet would have been considerably dissipated by the timeit reached the earth, nevertheless leaving the event observable from the Earth.On this model, there would be no need to explain the K/T geological boundary, orrather, the absence of a similar boundary at 3,200,000 years ago. One must look,then, for other types of corroboration of the 3,200,000 years event.Nonetheless, evidence for a planetary explosion at the time of the K/T boundaryat 65,000,000 years ago remained.B. TWO CLASSES IF ASTEROIDS AND A NEW ASTEROID BELT? One type of evidence unaccounted for in the original hypothesis but explained bythe revised version are the two types of asteroid classes, the “C” class,composed mostly carbonaceous material, and the “S” class, composed mostly ofsilicate material. “The C-type asteroids are found predominantly in the middleand outer main belt, whereas the S-types are concentrated toward the inner mainbelt. This is one of a few lines of evidence... that suggests two differentorigin events for the main belt.”43[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1053253] Moreover, a recentdiscovery of another belt of asteroid-like objects beyond Neptune may indicateyet another distinct planetary event as their origin.44[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1053461](1) AND MULTIPLE “EVENTS” Because of the existence of these two very different and chemically distinctclasses of asteroids, and the possible existence of a second asteroid beltbeyond Neptune,> I now consider that there may have been at least two bodies orbiting between> Mars and Jupiter (e.g. Planet V and Planet K...) that exploded at different> epochs. Indeed, if it turns out that the trans-Neptune belt is a third example> of an exploded body in our solar system, it might even be suggested that> explosion is a not-infrequent end state for masses of lunar or planetary> dimensions everywhere in our galaxy.45> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1053601] Note now that what began as an observed problem in the Titius-Bode law, that ofa missing planet, has now become a problem of a very different sort, that of twoplanets in more or less the same orbit, where the law predicts one.46[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1053764](2) THE REVISED SCENARIO OUTLINED Van Flandern summarizes the new revised Multiple Exploded Planet Hypothesis thisway:> I thus tentatively associate the earlier, larger mass-extinction event at (250> million years ago) with the explosion of Planet K in the main asteroid belt,> with iron meteorites (because of their long cosmic ray exposure ages), and> with most cataloged main-belt asteroids. This event occurred so long ago that> it gives Mars enough time to clear out most Mars-crossing asteroids from the> main belt - thereby neatly explaining the one other line of evidence that did> not fit the original hypothesis....> And I tentatively associate the smaller event at (65 million years ago) with> the explosion of Planet V in the inner asteroid belt, with achondritic and> stoney-iron meteorites (which have younger exposure ages than iron meteorites,> but are also differentiated and apparently came from a planet-sized body), and> with many inner-belt asteroids. Comets created by any explosion older than 10> (million years ago) would have long since vanished because of galactic tides> and passing stars. The population of Earth-crossing asteroids from this event> would now be reduced to a fraction of its original number. And this may have> been the event that delivered large quantities of water to the inner solar> system, most notably to Mars (which may have still been one of Planet V’s> moons at the time of the explosion).> The event at 3.2 (million years ago) that resulted in all comets that survive> to the present must have been the explosion of a much smaller body in the> asteroid belt. I associate this latest explosion with chondritic meteorites> (which are undifferentiated, and must therefore have come from a smaller> parent body), with most present-day Earth-crossing asteroids... The parent> body was apparently a moon of another planet(presumably of the former Planet K> or Planet V)...in many respects, the body that exploded perhaps resembled the> largest asteroid, Ceres, which we have previously suspected of being a former> moon of Planet K. 47> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1054074] Here the probable abundance of water on one of the (now two) original explodedplanets becomes critical, since “evidence of water erosion on achondriticmeteorites, presumed here to have originated from Planet V, indicates that theexploded planet contained abundant water as well, much of which would have hitMars.“48 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1054304] And that,of course, would explain the evidence for massive, sudden flooding in thesouthern hemisphere of Mars.49[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1054518]In this revised scenario, Van Flandern has both Mars and a smaller body (whichhe calls C) as satellites of Planet V, which, once released by the explosion,evolve into a small double-planetary system. Then, C exploded ca 3.2 millionyears ago, peppering Mars with craters and inundating it with water and givingrise to massive volcanism. 50[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1054702]"},{"pageContent":"4. PROBLEMS OF THE REVISED HYPOTHESIS A. THE COMMONALITY OF PLANETARY EXPLOSIONS It will now be evident what the problem of the revised “multiple exploded planethypothesis” is. Simply put, it is that explosions of planets, having been a rareoccurrence in the original version of the theory, the one that prevailed fromOlbers to Van Flandern’s first version, is now a disquietingly commonplaceoccurrence in the revised theory: “The recent discovery of another belt ofasteroid-like objects orbiting the Sun beyond Neptune has forcibly brought backto our attention the possibility that planetary explosions may be relativelycommon events, as uncomfortable as that thought is.”51[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1055135]B. MARS (1) AND “THE FLOOD” As has been evident throughout the discussion of Van Flandern’s exploded planethypothesis both in its original and in its revised forms, Mars plays a crucialrole, for the hypothesis is the only rational contender for the strong evidenceof a massive, sudden planetary inundation by water that Mars exhibits. Indeed,as I have remarked elsewhere, Mars alone of all the planets in the solar systemhas the best geological evidence for the type of Flood described in the OldTestament and in other ancient legends and traditions. Indeed, the severehemispherical disparity one encounters on Mars is exactly explained by thehypothesis, for “one hemisphere would have been heavily bombarded, and the otherbarely touched by the explosion.”52[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1055282](2) DEBRIS Under such conditions as these, one would expect not only that Mars’ atmosphere,magnetic poles, but also its polar alignment would be severely effected. Moreimportantly, the explosion of a nearby planet, whether V or C, would strew Marswith craters and debris of the event, at once inundating it, and possiblystripping it, of water, atmosphere, and whatever life might have existed there.And if, as we have speculated, the original Planet V supported intelligent life,then Mars may have been inundated with debris of a very different, artificial,nature.And this raises the question of the so-called “Face” on Mars and the equally, ifnot much more mysterious and apparently anomalous structures nearby in theCydonia region of Mars, namely, the so-called “Fort”, “Tholus” and the variouspyramidal and tetrahedral structures, including the famous “D and M” five-sidedPyramid. By the nature of the case, Van Flandern believes that these structures,if articificial, were built by some civilization prior to the event at 3.2million years ago. 53[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1055490](3) MARS’ EXCESS XENON 129 But there is an even more anomalous feature about Mars that must be explainedthan some anomalous formations and possible structures on the surface of Mars.Mars, as it turns out, not only has an unusually thin atmosphere for a planet ofits mass - a consequence of the fact that most of it was literally blown away inthe explosion54 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1055897] -but its content of the isotope Xenon 129 is almost three times that on any otherplanetary body. But Xenon 129 is a by-product of nuclear fission and does notordinarily arise from normal processes. 55[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1056607] Mars’ proximity toan exploding planet might explain such a phenomenon.C. WHAT MECHANISM CAN EXPLODE A PLANET? But Van Flandern’s mention of the anomalous Xenon 129 content of Mars’atmosphere raises the possibility of other explanations for its occurrence. As Ihave already noted in my previous book The Giza Death Star Deployed, Marsresearcher Richard Hoagland points out that the phenomenon of double-crateringand odd damage patterns on the D and M pyramid might indicate a non-naturalmechanism was at work on Mars: nuclear war. And this highlights what is the mostbasic problem with the Exploded Planet Hypothesis - in whatever version oneencounters it - and that is, what mechanism can explain why planets shouldsuddenly explode?The problem is not a small one, nor will it go away, for while the ExplodedPlanet Hypothesis does explain a tremendous amount of data, it does not do sowell when it comes to explain why a planet should explode to begin with. Afterall, while exploding planets may be a common occurrence in the revised theory,they are not so common that they have ever been observed in modern astronomicalhistory.One mechanism for exploding a planet, that favored by Zechariah Sitchin and manyother catastrophists, is that a large body entered the solar system, andcollided with the now missing planet, causing both to explode and consumethemselves. Van Flandern dispenses with this possibility rather quickly beforeproceeding to outline his own speculations:> Unless the exploded planet was a lot less massive than the evidence suggests,> chemical or collisional processes do not generate enough energy to blow it> apart. Nuclear processes are indicated by the meteoric evidence. It has been> objected that planets are not hot enough even in their cores for nuclear> reactions. Yet natural fission reactors have been known to operate even on the> Earth’s surface in the geologic past, suggesting related possibilities.56> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1056746] True enough, but one must also mention that for a full order nuclear explosionto occur by fissional processes, rather pure uranium 235 or plutonium 239 mustbe assembled into a critical mass rather quickly, and one simply would not beable to assemble enough critical mass of any known fissionable substance quicklyenough to produce an explosion large enough to explode a planet of even modestsize. There simply is no model for it.Perhaps sensing this difficulty, Van Flandern immediately goes on to suggest amore viable mechanism:> But the most natural way to produce the isotopic anomalies observed in> meteorites, and supply abundant energy, is by a matter-antimatter explosion.> This speculative possibility might result from a magnetic separation and> storage of the antimatter in a planet over billions of years before the> explosion; or from some sort of chain-reaction high-energy antimatter> generation process.57> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1056954] But again, there are problems with that scenario, for Van Flandern’s suggestedmatter-antimatter separation and storage model suggests that such “antimatteraccumulation” is a natural event in massive planetary bodies, and that in turnwould not only suggest that exploding planets are a rather commonplaceoccurrence, but also that large accumulations of anti-matter can be stored andkept separate from matter by natural causes! Yet, no exploding planets have beenobserved in modern astronomical history. More importantly, it has not beendemonstrated that antimatter can even occur in the large amounts seeminglysuggested by Van Flandern’s speculative model, much less stored and maintainedseparately by natural causes for a prolonged period of time.58[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1057101] In the end, one isleft with the most significant problem of them all: planets just do not suddenlyand spontaneously explode. There is simply no good model to explain such anevent by natural causes.And this leads to Van Flandern’s last suggestion, the one that simultaneously isthe most radical and yet, the most plausible; the explosion of a planet mightresult “from the intervention of intelligent beings. In my opinion, the lastpossibility should not be dismissed out of hand.”59[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1057368] “Intervention byintelligent beings” implies the existence of such beings in the first place, andsecondly, implies their knowledge of a physics capable of blowing up a planet,and their possession of the technological means of doing so. This is aconsequently breathtaking statement for someone of Van Flandern’s stature tomake! Van Flandern is gingerly and delicately implying that his exploded planetsmight have been blown up in deliberate acts of war. Yet, as will be seen in PartTwo of this book, it is precisely this model that the abundance of ancient textsactually supports!(1) THE RELEVANCE OF THE MODERN FICTITIOUS SCENARIO Van Flandern’s scenario of “intervention by intelligent beings” now highlightsthe relevance of the fictitious scenario that began this chapter, for clearly,one such motivation for an “intervention by intelligent beings” would beprecisely to protect their world from a catastrophic collision with ...anasteroid. But unfortunately, the possession of a technology sufficient to defendagainst such a threat also inevitably implies the existence of a technology thatcan be used for a similar purpose in war.As Van Flandern has pointed out in the above series of quotations, suchcollisions, while catastrophic to the planet undergoing them, even to the pointof the near extinction of all life on it, are not really plausible explanationsfor the explosion of the entire planet itself. Moreover, there is an even morepressing problem with this “intervention” to destroy a wandering planetary bodylike an asteroid, and that problem is highlighted by the Exploded PlanetHypothesis itself: asteroids are the result of planetary explosions. In otherwords, in order to defend against an asteroid, one must first explode a planetto begin with. After all, this is how the Exploded Planet Hypothesis began, asan explanation for the existence of asteroids. And there’s the rub, for no goodmechanism exists for why a planet should suddenly and spontaneously explode,barring “intervention by intelligent beings. ” and thus, inexorably, one isfaced with the real cause of the exploded and missing planet:War.(2) RILLES: WATER? OR SOMETHING ELSE? THE PROBLEM OF PERATT But what type of war? And what types of phsyics does exploding a planet imply?What types of weapons might be constructed upon that physics? Clearly, toexplode a planet would require a truly vast amount of energy. Van Flandernpoints the way forward in two unlikely passages:> Recent examination of the global distribution of interstellar hydrogen> “clouds” by G. Verschuur suggests that the majority of the observed ones> actually are parts of filaments(as would result from a supernova explosion),> are quite young, and lie within 100 parsecs of the Sun. This surprising result> suggests a linkage with the planetary breakup in the solar system.60> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1057533] Such filaments are but one step away from the electrical plasma filaments thatSwedish Nobel laureate and plasma physicist Hannes Alfvén posited to exist inhuge inter-galactic electrical currents. Such enormous energies imply, ofcourse, energies not only sufficient to the task of at least seriously scarringand searing planetary surface, but also a deeper physics capable of blowing oneup.But is there any evidence for this type of huge electrical discharge in thesolar system?Van Flandern indicates just such a class of evidence:> Mars displays evidence that there was enough water for a brief period to> produce flowing rivers and channels, although that would be impossible today.> Sinuous rilles on the Moon and Mars are almost certainly water-carved> features, and relatively recent as well, judging from the lack of overlying> craters. The assumption that they must be from lava flows is inconsistent in> some cases, since the rilles don’t slope away from potential lava sources, and> neither lava nor any other candidate substance is not known to carve sinuous> features.61 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1057741] As we shall see in the next chapter, however, some of these Martian and Lunarrilles point not to water as their origin, but precisely to giganticelectrostatic discharges. They point to a physics sufficient to the task ofplanetary scarring of large areas of a planet’s surface, to a physics that isweaponizable, and most importantly, to human observers of the events. And thatphysics in turn points to an even deeper physics, one that might be capable ofexploding an entire planet.In short, the rilles point to plasmas and to “the problem of Peratt.”"},{"pageContent":"2.

PLASMA COSMOLOGY AND ANCIENT MYTHOLOGY One of the more recent and serious entries into the question of the existence ofan ancient paleophysics must surely be plasma cosmology. Brainchild of Swedishphysicist and Nobel laureate Hannes Alfvén, plasma cosmology is a significantdeparture within mainstream physics from the “Big Bang” cosmology spawned byEinstein’s relativity theories and pursued by most cosmological physicists. InAlfven’s view, the most important force in the universe is not the geometry ofgravity, as with relativity-based cosmological theories, but electromagnetism,and the complex geometries of rotating plasma vortices. In Alfvén’s view,electromagnetism spans all scales, from the very small to the very large,including star-and-planetary systems, to whole galaxies, to the even largerscale of clusters of galaxies. This is another way of saying that our own galaxyand solar system are not electrically neutral, but rather, electrically dynamicsystems.Eric J. Lerner - a noted plasma physicist himself and author of the bestlayman’s study of plasma cosmology, The Big Bang Never Happened - tracesAlfvén’s fascination with plasmas to his boyhood experiences in Sweden, whereAlfvén “was fascinated by the spectacular displays of the northern lights, themoving curtains of filaments and spikes.“63[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1058450] Alfvén even quippedhumorously that ”,Our ancestors called them ‘the Spears of Odin,””64[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1058741] a statement as weshall soon see that may not be a joke after all, but a significant clue into apaleophysical problem discovered by fellow plasma physicist Anthony Peratt.What Alfvén soon began to notice, however, was that the same filaments that hesaw in aurora displays were also being found in his laboratory:> “Whenever a piece of vacuum equipment started to misbehave, there they were,”> he recalls. They were there too, in photographs of solar prominences and of> the distant Veil and Orion nebulas....> Many investigators had analyzed the laboratory filaments before, so Alfvén> knew what they were: tiny electromagnetic vortices that snake through a> plasma, carrying electrical currents. The vortices are produced by a> phenomenon known as the “pinch effect.” A straight thread of electrical> current flowing through a plasma produces a cylindrical magnetic field, which> attracts other currents flowing in the same direction. Thus the tiny current> threads tend to “pinch” together, drawing the plasma with them... The> converging threads twine into a plasma rope, much as water converging toward a> drain generates a swirling vortex, or air rushes together in a tornado. The> filaments are plasma whirlwinds.65> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1058880] Lerner explains the implications of this important phenomenon as follows:> Magnetic fields and currents can concentrate matter and energy far faster and> more effectively than can gravity. The magnetic force of a plasma thread> increases with the velocity of the plasma. This leads to a feedback effect: as> threads are pulled into the vortex, they move faster, which increases the> force on the threads of current and pulls them still faster into the filament.> In addition, a contracting mass tends to spin faster and faster, like an ice> skater who pulls in his or her arms. This generates a centrifugal force which> fights the contraction. Magnetic filaments can carry away this excess spin, or> angular momentum, allowing further contraction, while gravity cannot.66> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1059031] Lerner reproduces the following diagram to illustrate this “pinch effect:” Pinching Effect of an Electrical Current in a Plasma67[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1059227]002 [images/00002.jpg] One unique component of Alfvén’s theory was its ability to be applied to systemsof any scale, from the very large to the very small. “Plasmas should looksimilar no matter how big or small they are. ‘If we can extrapolate from thelaboratory to the solar system, which is a hundred trillion times larger,’ heasks, ‘then why shouldn’t plasma behave the same way for the entire observableuniverse, another hundred trillion times larger?’”68[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1059374] Consequently,> In his theory, a galaxy, spinning in the magnetic fields of intergalactic> space, generates electricity, as any conductor does when it moves through a> magnetic field... The huge electrical current produced by the galaxy flows in> great filamentary spirals toward the center of the galaxy, where it turns and> flows out along the spin axis.

The results are stunning: Comparison of Actual Galaxies with Peratt’s Computer Simulation11004 [images/00004.jpg] The implications of plasma cosmology for the hypothesis of an ancientinterplanetary war, fought with horrendously powerful weapons, now begins totake on significance, for if a planetary system such as our solar system, or agalaxy such as our own Milky Way, are not electrically neutral, then the samebasic technology that allows such simulations to be made, might, on a larger andmore sophisticated scale, also be able to tap into these enormous supplies ofenergy for either good or ill. In short, such a principle could conceivably beweaponized, and if weaponized, then it becomes entirely feasible that explodinga planet would be child’s play for the very energy of an entire planetarysystem, much less a galaxy.72[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1060172]And these observations bring up..."},{"pageContent":"1... THE PROBLEM OF THE MERCURY RECTIFIERS. Alfvén was soon confronted by a new phenomenon associated with plasmas: thesudden and explosive release of energy.

This compound was placed into the cylinders ofthe Bell, and subjected to intense electrical pulsing. The only differencebetween the Bell and Bostick’s plasma focus (and indeed, between it and allother plasma focuses) is that the Bell’s two cylinders were rotated in contrarydirections to each other, a simple but brilliant expedient that the Naziscientists had hit upon for the cohering75[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1061060] of the spin of theatoms-soon-to-be-ions of mercury and other substances that they wereexperimenting with. Additionally, the Nazi scientists also added one morefactor: they cooled this mysterious substance inside the Bell with liquid oxygenor nitrogen. These sophisticated additions would have, in all probability, havemade the Bell a much more efficient device than the common plasma focus.76[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1061263]In any case, Lerner reproduces the following schematic of a plasma focus device: Plasma Focus Detice 77[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1061614]005 [images/00005.jpg] But what happened when Bostick turned on this device?Lerner states that the plasma inside the device is rapidly ionized by thecurrent, forming into “eight or ten pairs of force-free filaments” which thenbegin to “roll down the cylinder, propelled by the interaction of their currentswith the background magnetic field.” At this juncture, an amazing thing happens:> When they reach the end of the cylinder, they fountain inward... Each pair,> consisting of two vortices rotating in opposite directions, annihilate each> other, leaving only one survivor to carry the entire current. This survivor> pinches itself off into a doughnut-shaped filamentary knot - a plasmoid.78> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1061807] Lerner then reproduces the following diagram of the minute plasmoid Schematic of a Plasmoid 79[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1061955]006 [images/00006.jpg] Lerner continues:> The plasmoid, only a half-millimeter across, now contains all the energy> stored in the magnetic field of the entire device - a million or more times> bigger> in volume. For a fraction of a microsecond, as the plasmoid continues to pinch> itself, it remains stable. But as its magnetic field increases, the electrons> orbit in smaller circles, giving off radiation of a higher frequency. Because> plasma tends to be opague to low-frequency radiation and transparent to> high-frequency, the radiation suddenly begins to escape.> This sets in motion a second series of events. As the electrons radiate their> energy away, the current drops and the magnetic field weakens.

Alfvén had observed. The> falling magnetic field generates a huge electrical field, which shoots two> high-energy beams out of the plasmoid - the electrons in one direction, the> ions in the other.

In the course of> this process some ions are heated to such high temperatures that they fuse....> A plasma focus can increase the power density of its emissions by a factor of> ten thousand trillion over that of the incoming energy - comparable to the> ratio of a quasar to a galaxy. 80> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1062148] But what would happen if, at the very moment that the electrons begin to radiateaway their energy, setting up the collapse of the magnetic field, they werepulsed again? Such would indeed appear to have been one of the principles behindthe Nazi Bell.81 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1062363]In any case, several things are now clear.First, the simple expedient of a plasma focus allows one to access a multitudeof phenomena, from anti-gravitational effects, to thermonuclear fusion - thesame basic explosive energy behind the hydrogen bomb - to deadly radiations inthe form of high frequency electrons and ions, deadly streams of electricalenergy.Secondly, if such energy could be tapped at a “celestial” scale a weapon ofextraordinary power could be based upon it. Since plasma cosmology shows thesame effects from the very small to the very large, this should theoretically bepossible.Thirdly, it is clear that the idea of accessing this energy did not begin withthe Russians and Americans in the 1960s but fully two decades before, with theNazis.82 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1062552] Bycounter-rotating the two cylinders of a typical plasma focus, by utilizing whatwas probably a radioactive compound to begin with as its plasma-forming fuel,and by super-cooling that material, it would appear that the Nazis made suchgreat strides in plasma technology and its uses that their ideas have yet to beduplicated. A case in point is that no one to my knowledge has since thought torotate the two cylinders of the focus, much less rotate them in oppositedirections!As I indicated in my book The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, the Nazis’ interest inpursuing this arcane line of research might very well have been motivated bytheir knowledge of occult texts, such as the ancient Hindu “vimana” texts thatrefer to aircraft propelled by using mercury as fuel. In short, they may havebeen deliberately investigating the ancient traditions and legends of the godsand their wars for their paleophysical content and potentials. In this regard itshould be noted that Germany, throughout the late nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies, was not only a home to scholarly research into the ancient Vedicculture of India, but even more so into the ancient cultures of Mesopotamia:Sumer, Babylon, Akkadia, and Assyria. The legends of the wars of the gods weretherefore very well known by the Nazi regime. It therefore stands to reason thatthe texts that we will examine in part two of this book might have formed themythological impetus and motivation to some of their research.But there is also another way that plasmas enter into the question ofpaleophysics, as we shall see momentarily."},{"pageContent":"3. PLASMA PHYSICS, THE PLASMA FOCUS, AND SCALAR PHYSICS How might one access this relatively simple technology and physics at the“celestial” scale and weaponize it to explode a planet, and do so from a “safe”distance? It is here that there are direct, though little publicized,connections between plasma physics and the even more arcane world of “scalar” or“quantum potential” physics.Throughout my works I have repeatedly made reference to the work of scalarphysics theorist and exponent, Lt. Col. (US Army, Ret) Tom Bearden. It isnecessary to do so once again.83[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1062887] Bearden maintainsthat at the core of the theory of scalar physics are three relatively obscure,highly mathematical, entirely pre-relativistic, and immensely unusual papers.Two of them were by the well-known mathematician and theoretical physicist E.T.Whittaker, and one was by a physicist named Barus. Of the three, the Whittakerpapers are breathtaking in their implications, not the least of which becausethey can be made to work within the context of the later-developed quantumtheory.The first paper, a lengthy and highly mathematical tome, is a masterpiece whosefull implications - in spite of its benign and somewhat intimidating title “Onthe partial differential equations of mathematical physics” - are spelled out byWhittaker in the conclusion of the paper(I have italicized the significantportions that bear directly on Bearden’s analysis which follows):> It is clear from the foregoing that the field of force due to a gravitating> body can be analyzed, by a “spectrum analysis” as it were, into an infinite> number of constituent fields; and although the whole field of force does not> vary with time, yet each of the constituent fields is of an undulatory> character, consisting of a simple wave-disturbance propagated with uniform> velocity.... In each of these constituent fields the potential will be> constant along each wave-front, and consequently the gravitational force in> each constituent field will be perpendicular to the wave-front, i.e., the> waves will be longitudinal. 84> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1063125] The significance of this short paragraph may be missed unless one remembers thatE.T. Whittaker was also a physicist who believed ardently in the aether, i.e.,in a medium or mechanism of electromagnetic energy propagation. Indeed, he isthe same Whittaker who wrote a classic history of the concept of the aether.Note also that this paper was originally published in Germany, and therefore,the Germans could hardly have been unaware of its existence or of its importanceas a non-relativistic physics as they sought to explain the curious anomaliesof... their late war radar experiments. Indeed, their experiments with radar,and even the Bell itself, are evidence that they were pursuing this “scalarphysics” with a vengeance.To understand what Bearden means by “scalar” waves in the medium or vacuum, wemust now go further into the history of where public consumption physics wentwrong. According to Bearden, it began to make its first massive wrong turn afterMaxwell. Maxwell first formulated his equations in a mathematical language allbut extinct today, a mathematical language called quaternion geometry. Thismathematical language differs significantly from the standard “linear algebra,”“tensor calculus” and “vector analysis” in which the standard electromagnetictheory is usually couched in textbooks and physics lectures. In short, theequations one learns in physics textbooks and physics courses today as Maxwell’sequations are not Maxwell’s original equations! They are edited equations. Butto understand what effect this simple change of mathematical language - fromquaternions to vector analysis - had on physics, we need to understand a fewsimple concepts.First, there are two types of effects that electromagnetic fields can have oncharged particles: (1) translation, and (2) stress. There are two types oftranslation, or movement. The first type is simple translation in a straightline, producing the electrical, or “E” field itself. The second type of movementis that of a spiral, mathematically symbolized as the “B” field. We will not bedealing with the “B” field immediately.Now let us assume there are two vectors, E, and E2, acting upon a particle asshown:007 [images/00007.jpg] The result is a translation in the direction of vector E3 as the two vectors areadded together to get a result, which is called aptly enough, a “resultant”vector. Thus, in systems where a large number of translation vectors areinvolved, “the entire system can be replaced by a single vector,” the resultant,which describes the actual translation that results from the original vectors.85[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1063487]Now observe that if no translation occurs, the resultant is a “zero vector.”However, one must always recall that one is dealing with geometry and not simplymathematics or numbers. One can therefore envision a multitude of multi-vectorsystems resulting in a zero translation vector, and yet which have profoundlydifferent internal stresses and geometries:008 [images/00008.jpg] If one were trained to think only in terms of the conventions of linear algebrato replace multi-vector systems with a resultant vector, then in each of thethree cases or systems above, one will replace the entire system with a zeroresultant vector. This means that the internal stresses of the systems and theirrotational characteristics - each obviously quite different - are all replacedby a zero vector, and thus the three systems are erroneously reduced to physicalequivalence by a mathematical convention!Now we are in a position to see what a scalar is, and why Maxwell deliberatelychose quaternion geometry to write his equations, for he had in mind when he didso precisely the types of physical stress situations that are simply representedby the vortices in the above diagram.In standard linear algebra, each of the arrows in the above system would bemathematically represented like this:> v(vector) = ai + bj + ck. Thus, if the total sum of all such vectors is no translation, then one willreplace all such mathematical expressions with a zero vector. But as we haveseen, each of these systems contains an internal rotation or stress, sosomething remains. The question is, how to represent it mathematically?In quaternion geometry, a quaternion is simply a “scalar” plus a “vector,” and a“scalar” is simply a pure magnitude, a “number” that has no direction. It simply“is.” Thus, a quaternion (q) is a scalar(s) plus a vector (v):> q = s + v Substituting our previous expression of a vector into this, we get> q = s + ai + bj + ck. Thus, for the hexagonally shaped system above, one would have six differentexpressions resembling q = s + ai + bj + ck. Now imagine we multiply each ofthese vectors. According to the special rules in linear algebra for multiplyingsuch things, we know that zero times zero is zero. So in linear algebra onewould end up with nothing once again, a zero vector, since no translation hasoccurred. But in quaternion geometry the scalars in our hexagonal vortexdiagram, which are not zero, all multiply, and give - according to the rules ofquaternion multiplication - the following result:> q x q= s2+ t2 +u2 + w2 + x2 +y2 +0v,,where 0v is the zero vector and the squared quantities are the multipliedscalars. Thus, in quaternion geometry the internal stress is preserved eventhough there is zero translation occurring. The scalars thus represent puremagnitudes of force “locked within” a structure possessing no “direction” or“translation. ”Now we are in a position to understand what scalar physics is: it is notstandard vector or “linear” physics in any sense, but is the non-linear physicsof internal stresses in the local medium.We are likewise now in a position to understand the enormous implications of theend of Whittaker’s paper quoted above, implications that Bearden’s analysismakes quite clear:> (The) interference of scalar potentials - each of which is actually a set of> longitudinal (electromagnetic) waves, and not a scalar entity at all, but a> multivectorial entity - produces (electromagnetic) fields and waves and their> dynamics. Hence we hypothesize that the Whittaker interference of the> propagating reordered (electromagnetic) energy entities, continuously> occurring at any point in space, generates the zero-point (electromagnetic)> field energy fluctuations of the vacuum itself. Indeed, (a) paper by> Evans...has already shown that just such “scalar interferometry” produces> transverse (electromagnetic) fields and waves in the vacuum at a distance. 86> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1063825] In other words, one must imagine each of the scalar entities accompanying thevectors in the diagrams above as being composed of bi-directional longitudinalor “acoustic” waves in the medium. Thus, Whittaker “decomposes” the scalarentities into pairs of such pressure waves or “stresses” in the medium.Combining, or “interfering” such waves thus causes the standard electromagneticfields and waves observed in standard physics. And most importantly, this can bedone “at a distance.”But what does this mean?Simply put, since every atom and every type of atom consists of particles withcharge and/or mass, then every atom has its own peculiar “scalar signature” or“resonance” (recall the diagrams above and imagine the mathematical notationsthat would describe each in quaternion geometry). Thus, to produce an effect onany one of these systems, one simply has to “work backwards” as it were, andconfigure its scalar signature, decomposing each of the scalars into its ownpair of bi-directional longitudinal pulses and waves.One may thus envision the innumerable types of “zero sum vector systems” likethe diagram above as also being a kind of template for action, or what Beardencalls a “causal system robot,” or CSR, a template for producing a desiredoutcome in a system at a distance by means of configuring resonance to its“scalar signature”:> With sufficient theoretical development, one can “work backwards” to obtain a> desired causal system... corresponding to some physical system.... One thereby> creates a deterministic set of spacetime curvatures and impressed dynamics,> which we call an “engine.”...By building in scalar interferometry functions,> the CSR can be given “weapons” capabilities, etc.87> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1064078] That is, one reproduces the “scalar” or if one prefers the topological signatureof the system one wants to influence (or destroy), and loads the appropriateinformation into it:> (By) assembling the desired (longitudinal) wave biwave subsets, the two scalar> potentials and their resulting interference-produced carrier wave are> internally structured as desired. This is the use of the so-called internal> information content of the field. We speak of a deliberately structured> potential, field, or wave as having been conditioned, dimensioned, or> activated. If these terms are deemed inappropriate, just use the more generic> term “internally structured.”88> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1064281] By the well-known mass-energy conversion mechanism, mass and inertia are thus“the direct result of - and are - trapped scalar resonance.” But what is“trapped scalar resonance”? “The trapping mechanism is the spin of theparticle,”89 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1064501] thatis, the peculiar internal rotating stresses or vorticies in the medium ofvarious systems, diagramed in our simple example above!90[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1064649]More than anything else, it is this ability to configure a template based uponthe scalar signature and its long distance resonance effects in the medium thatallows one to produce an action at a distance that best fills the bill for the“monstrous area of physics” that the Germans were working on with the Bell. Itis, indeed, a very sophisticated form of magic, and sympathetic magic at that.For the result of this new physics is that space itself has structure andcontent, the medium or “aether” may be viewed as nothing but a vast set ofscalar potentials, which can be decomposed into longitudinal wave pairs.91[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1064890] And since a “scalar”represents an internal rotational stress - as per our diagrams above - scalarphysics is also not only non-linear, but vorticular physics.92[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1065071]A. BEARDEN’S CLAIMS FOR “SCALAR” PHYSICS AND ITS WEAPONIZATION (1) THE DANGERS OF SCALAR RESONANCE: PLANET-BUSTING “DOOMSDAY” IMPLICATIONS In addition to a superb defensive capability, there is a far more ominousoffensive capability. Since, as has been seen, “scalar waves pass through theelectron shells of an atom and interact with the nucleus” directly, this meansthat “they are continually absorbed and emitted by all nuclei in the universe.”Consequently, “any large collection of nuclei — such as a star or a planet - isa strong absorber and radiator of scalar wave radiation.”93[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1065299] One cannot ponderthis too long nor overestimate its importance, for it means that any large masssuch as a planet is a natural resonator of such waves, and this means any scalarweapon has a planetary-sized potential destructive power:> (This) scalar coupling of the solar system provides a major check on> unrestricted use of the large Soviet strategic scalar EM weapon systems.

Unless carefully employed, use of the weapons could cause a terrible> backlash to the user as well as the victim, and even accidentally cause the> destruction of the earth itself.94> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1065487] One may even envision the use of a scalar weapon to acoustically oscillate anentire planet beyond its ability to damp the enormous cascade of quantumpotential energy to the point that it would explode.95[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1066056] Bearden himself isquite alive to this disturbing potential for the weapons:> (If) the discharge happens to tickle the Sun and Moon’s feedback loops the> wrong way, you’ll get convulsions of the earth, mighty burps of the sun> raining fire and brimstone on the earth, and a violent increase in the> interior heat of the earth’s molten core, with a concomitant eruption of that> core right up through the mantle....> (Whenever) one activates a large scalar (electromagnetic) weapon, one> immediately places the entire earth in deadly peril. The slightest misstep,> and it’s curtains for everyone. And it’s curtains for the earth as well.96> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1066256] It takes only a little imagination to see that this principle could be pressedeven farther, to the inability of the planet to damp its violent, scalar-inducedacoustic cavitation. The planet would consume itself in a violent explosionmaking a hydrogen bomb look like a firecracker.But in any case, as Bearden makes abundantly clear, scalar weapons possessplanet-busting potential.Any number of mechanisms now suggest themselves for how one might access scalarphenomena, for these are specifically, as has been seen, vorticular andnon-linear in nature. One might construct a “template” allowing one to unleashthe tremendous electrical energy in a planetary system or to create enormousplasma discharges striking a planetary surface. Alternatively, one might usethat energy itself to create powerful longitudinal standing waves in a target.In either case, there would be enormous electrostatic displays and acousticcavitation in any planetary target just prior to its explosion.And this brings us back to plasma cosmology, and to the “problem of Peratt.” Andthe “problem of Peratt” is simply that he maintains that ancient observersrecorded precisely such displays - beyond those of a mere aurora borealis - on acelestial scale."},{"pageContent":"B. PETROGLYPHS AND ANTHONY PERATT: PLASMA PALEOPHYSICS Peratt’s work is quite the crucial matter for any investigation of paleophysicsalong the lines of Alfvén’s plasma cosmology, for not only is Peratt a respectedphysicist, but more importantly, his paleophysical investigations andcomparisons of ancient American Indian petroglyphs with laboratory plasmadischarges has been published in a series of papers in peer-reviewed journals.97[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1066456] Two of these papers- “Evidence for an Intense Aurora Recorded in Antiquity,” and “The Origin ofPetroglyphs” - were published while Peratt was associated with the Los AlamosNational Laboratory, raising the question of whether or not his work and that ofhis fellow scientists at Los Alamos might involve such paleophysicalinvestigations.98 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1067170]And a glance at his other research interests would tend to support that view,for these “include numerical and experimental contributions to high-energydensity plasmas and intense particle beams, inertial confinement fusion,explosively-driven pulsed power generators, lasers, intense-power-microwavesources, particles, high-energy density phenomena, new concepts in spacepropulsion and high-performance computing,” as well as his interest in plasmacosmology and cosmogony.99[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1067882] Peratt isconsequently no light-weight New Age prognosticator. On the contrary, hisinterests and associations would seem to suggest in the strongest possiblefashion that someone, somewhere in the corridors of power in government blackprojects is seriously interested in pursuing the avenues of paleophysicsresearch that his investigations outline. Plasma Physicist and Cosmologist Anthony Peratt009 [images/00009.jpg] But what exactly has Peratt uncovered? Peratt himself puts the case with all theunderstated succinctness of a scientific abstract: “Based on the compilation andanalysis of the order of 50,000 digitally recorded petroglyphs, we haveidentified several dozen general categories of instabilities of a highlynon-linear plasma column generally associated with multi-mega ampere Z-pinches.This suggests that prehistoric man recorded the occurrence of an intense andlong-lasting aurora.” 100[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1068031] By means of a“direct comparison of the temporal evolution of experimental instabilities withpetroglyphs” Peratt demonstrates that “nearly all archaic carvings match thephenomena that might be produced in an intense and long-lasting aurora.” 101[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1068242]In other words, theseemingly meaningless stick figures of many petroglyphs are not meaningless atall. They are the accurate recorded observations by humans of immense electricaland plasma phenomena on a celestial and planetary scale.As if this were not enough, Peratt is even more explicit in his lengthy article,“Characteristics for the occurrence of a High Current, Z-Pinch Aurora asRecorded in Antiquity,” which appeared in the Dec 6, 2003 issue of the IEEETransactions on Plasma Science. There Peratt states quite unequivocally that “itis found that a great many archaic petroglyphs can be classified according toplasma stability and instability data. As the same morphological types are foundworldwide, the comparisons suggest the occurrence of an intense aurora, as mightbe produced if the solar wind had increased between one and two orders ofmagnitude, millennia ago.”102[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1068485]For our purposes, this implies three significant things:> (1) There is concrete worldwide evidence of a massive aurora phenomenon on a> planetary scale from human prehistory, implying the existence of a physics> able to produce such a phenomenon;> (2) human beings existed contemporaneously with this phenomenon, or other> intelligent observers existed who passed on their knowledge to subsequent> humanity; and,> (3) humans more or less accurately recorded it in the form of certain> petroglyphs. The last point is the most significant, for it is not yet an argument for thecase that they may have accurately understood it, much less have produced it.Having made this last all-important observation, however, it is highlysuggestive and paradoxical that Peratt himself begins the main text of hisarticle in the following fashion:> On July 9, 1962, the United States detonated a 1.4-megaton thermonuclear> device in the atmosphere 400 km above Johnston island. The event produced a> plasma whose initial spherical shape striated within a few minutes as the> plasma electrons and ions streamed along the Earth’s magnetic field to produce> an artificial aurora....> Concomitant with the artificial aurora was a degradation of radio> communications over wide areas of the Pacific, lightning discharges,> destruction of electronics in monitoring satellites, and an electromagnetic> pulse that affected some power circuitry as far away as Hawaii. 103> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1068809] In other words, it is only with the rise of modern physics and its associatedtechnologies that such large scale plasma and aurora phenomena can really beunderstood at all, since only these technologies allow it to be artificiallyproduced and studied in the laboratory. That the “laboratory” in this case wasthe entire earth’s magnetic field and a 1.4 megaton hydrogen bomb detonatedatmospherically should give one pause as to just what the implications mayreally be for an ancient human observation of similar large-scale auroraleffects.In any case, having begun his article in this thought-provoking fashion, Perattpasses immediately to a scientific consideration of the characteristics ofauroral plasma columns and displays. These plasma instabilities come in twobasic forms and may be observed over a wide range of electromagneticfrequencies.104 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1068950] Thefirst type of instability is a “column” of many varieties of toroidal orvorticular structure. The second basic type is a “sheet.” Peratt notes that thefirst type may have dimensions of “hundreds of kilometers in diameter,” whilesheets may be as wide as tens of kilometers.105[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1069211] The red, green andblue auroras that occur naturally in the earth’s atmosphere are easily explainedas the natural result of atoms of nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere“de-exciting” from their plasma state.106[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1069352]In producing the various “mini-plasma” geometries in the laboratory, data wasobtained from the U.S. Department of Energy “pulsed-power facilities at the LosAlamos National Laboratory and Sandia national Laboratories.” Additionally“high-explosive generators” from the United States and Russia also contributedto the data set. Currents ranged from a few hundreds of kiloamperes toapproximately 150 mega-amperes.107[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1069493]Most notably, the geometries themselves were “generated by applying high-voltagepulses to gas-puffs to simulate an aurora-like plasma inflow... and concentricplasma sheets formed by nested cylindrical foils to produce high-velocity shockwaves.”108 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1069644] Thebeautiful and evocative geometries that resulted were “a few centimeters indiameter and 203 centimeters in length.”109[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1070039]But what has this to do with petroglyphs? And what has any of it to do withpaleophysics and the possible thesis of an ancient interplanetary war?Again, Peratt points the way in his paper, for in spite of its scientifictechnicality, its real focus is not on the plasma geometries themselves, but ontheir uncanny resemblance to these ancient petroglyphs. Notably, Peratt focuseshis attention on petroglyphs thought to be dated from 10,000 to 2000 BC.110[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1070180] This is significant,for it may provide yet another anchor point for any eventual dating of the “war”scenario, and as we shall see, it falls within the latest possible temporalwindow for the cataclysmic events.111[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1070497]In the presentation of Peratt’s comparison of petroglyphs and the geometries ofplasma instabilities, I will rely on the excellent summary of his work providedby comparative mythologist David Talbott, and Australian physicist WallaceThornhill, from whose masterful and provocative book, Tunderbolts of the Gods,this chapter takes its name. Talbott and Thornhill’s study is an apt summary ofPeratt’s extensive research, reprising its more salient points and greatlyexpanding upon its cultural and historical implications.112[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1070764]One of the most common of the petroglyphs is the so-called “Squatter Man,” anapparently humanoid stick figure with two dots to either side of its “torso.”Found worldwide, the most common forms are early American Indian versions. Native American Indian “Squatter Man” Petroglyphs010 [images/00010.jpg] Such nomenclature, assigned to these pictographs by anthropologists who couldview such cultures as nothing other than “primitive,” may have missed the pointentirely, according to Peratt, for they may be indicative of a columnar plasmainstability, indeed, bear an uncanny resemblance to it. Peratt’s Comparison of a Three-Dimensional Plasma Instability on the Left, withits Two Dimensional Analogue on the Right (photos found on p. 22 of Talbott andThornhill’s Thunderbolts of the Gods)011 [images/00011.jpg] As the above comparison indicates, the “Squatter Man” petroglyph may be nothingmore than the recorded two dimensional observation of a vast auroral display,with the two dots to either side of the torso representing the various toroidalforms such instabilities may take.Yet another such comparison is the “stacked torus” columnar instabilityseemingly indicated by yet another petroglyph. Pictograph from Kayenta, Arizona.012 [images/00012.jpg] As the above interpretation of Talbott and Thornhill indicates, this petroglyph,from an American Indian site at Kayenta, Arizona, not only gives anotherverifiable connection to plasma physics but also demonstrates that “primitive”man may not have been as primitive as we have been led to believe, but was anaccurate recorder of phenomena and events he witnessed. This highlights a verysignificant question, for if these ancient human observers were accuraterecorders and observers of such phenomena in their myths and art works, whywould one argue, as catastrophism does, that they accurately record such awesomecelestial displays, and yet dismiss them as mere metaphor-makers or inaccuraterecorders, when those same cultures often indicate that such displays are theresult of the wars of the gods, fought with weapons of lightning and stones? Wewill return again and again to this point throughout this work.

THE DIVINE WEAPON One of the most intriguing comparisons of Peratt’s plasma instability geometriesand ancient depictions comes not from Peratt, but from Talbott and Thornhillthemselves. Using the following depiction of the “divine thunderbolt” of theBabylonian god Ninurta, as commonly depicted in ancient art, they compare it toan astonishingly similar model of a plasma discharge in the laboratory. Ninurta with Thunderbolts015 [images/00015.jpg] Ninurta’s Divine Weapon and Plasma Discharge Compared (From p. 52 of Talbott andThornhill’s Thunderbolts of the Gods)016 [images/00016.jpg] Moreover, the comparison is not confined to Babylonia. The various Greekdepictions of the “thunderbolts of Zeus” bear similar artistic depictions of thesame plasma geometry: Various Greek Depictions of the Thunderbolts of Zeus (From p. 53 of Talbott andThornhill’s The Thunderbolts of the Gods)017 [images/00017.jpg] An even more thought provoking comparison may be made of multi-tailed“pitchfork” Greek depictions of this thunderbolt, and similar laboratorygenerated plasma discharges: Multi-Tailed Greek Thunderbolt “Pitchforks” (From p. 53 of Talbott andThornhill’s Thunderbolts of the Gods)018 [images/00018.jpg] “Pitchfork ” Plasma Discharge in the Laboratory (From p. 55 of Talbott andThornhill’s Thunderbolts of the Gods)019 [images/00019.jpg] While the above is but a small sample of the many fascinating comparisons drawnby Peratt, and by David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill in their excellent studyThe Thunderbolts of the Gods, it should suffice to demonstrate that plasmaphysicists have taken the paleophysical examination of ancient art to new anddetailed - and in Peratt’s case, scientifically peer-reviewed - levels."},{"pageContent":"D. EVIDENCE OF PLANETARY SIZED DISCHARGES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM In addition to all the foregoing considerations, there is evidence that variousbodies in the solar system have suffered huge electrostatic discharges, scarringtheir surfaces. Such massive discharges may have been large enough to justbarely be seen from Earth by man. One class of evidence that should beconsidered are so-called “rilles” which in mainstream planetary geologicaltheory are the result of brief releases of running water, or, in some cases,lava. While such channels can indeed be created by such means, there are rillesthat show evidence of creation by the mechanism of gigantic lightning strikes.One such rille is the Hyginus Rille on Earth’s nearest neighbor, the Moon. Hyginus Rille on the Moon020 [images/00020.jpg] Notice the circular “pits” in this rille. Such pits, according to physicistWallace Thronhill, are a typical characteristic of channels created by massiveelectrostatic discharges.113[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1071435]One of the moons of Jupiter, Europa, shows even more dramatic evidence ofmassive discharges, displaying a typical feature of the “corkscrew” effect ofplasma filaments. Corkscrew Dircharge Pattern on Jupiter’s Moon, Europa021 [images/00021.jpg] Wallace Thornhill’s characterization of this type of evidence may be summarizedas follows, noting the comparison of craters on planets and moons with thosecreated by electrical discharge in the laboratory:> Both tend to be perfectly circular because an electrical arc always strikes> perpendicular to a surface. Walls are nearly vertical and floors are nearly> flat as the circular motion of the arc machines out the crater. Impact and> explosion craters, by contrast, tend to have a bowl shape: Instead of being> lifted from the surface, excavated material undergoes shock displacement,> shattering and flowing in a manner similar to that of a fluid for the duration> of the shock.> Another common feature of electrically generated craters, Thornhill explains,> is terracing along the sides, sometimes corkscrewing down to the floor,> following the rotary motion of the arc. The Moon and Mars both provide many> examples of terraced and corkscrew craters.114> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1071906] These considerations indicate that at one time the solar system was far moreelectrically active than it is now.But perhaps the most important - and from the standpoint of an actual war havingbeen the cause of such scarring - a significant piece of evidence for thisplanetary-wide scarring by massive electrical discharges lies on Earth’s closestneighbor, Mars, in the gigantic Valles Marineris, a huge canyon some fourthousand kilometers long, up to seven hundred kilometers across “in some places,and up to six hundred kilometers deep.” Nor is this the only mystery to thishighly anomalous planetary feature. “Approximately two million cubic kilometersof the Martian surface was removed with no comparable debris field apparent.”115[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1072135] Valles Marineris on Mars: Scarred Evidence of a Massive Electric Discharge022 [images/00022.jpg] This is not, however, the only thing unusual about the Valles Marineris.Wallace Thornhill was first contacted by comparative mythologist David Talbott,who, investigating an ancient theme of classical mythology and knowing of theValles Marineris, decided to get in touch with the physicist. What Talbott hadnoticed was the “Scarface Motif’ of some ancient myths. This motif, common tomany cultures, is one of a “warrior-god, who, at a time of upheaval, receives agaping wound or scar on his forehead, face, or thigh.” But it would be a mistaketo see it as a merely “personal” wound inflicted on some mythological hero. Itis, rather, the wound associated with the “celestial archetype of warriors - thegod whom human warriors celebrated as their inspiration on the battlefield. Inearly astronomies, this warrior archetype is identified with a specific planet -Mars.”116 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1072438]Talbott immediately asked a significant question, raising the “Problem ofPeratt” yet again, and in yet a different form: was it just possible that> The “wounding” of Mars refers to an actual event? “I remember looking at one> of the first Mariner photographs of Mars,” Talbott recalls. “It displayed a> stupendous chasm cutting across the face of the planet. Even from a> considerable distance, the chasm looked like a scar.... At that moment I> ralized that of all the planets and moons in our solar system, Mars alone bore> the likeness of the warrior-god’s wound.”117> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1072741] Behind the myth, in other words, lay a very real event: science and mythologywere converging at the very place mythology — if taken seriously from apaleophysical perspective — said it would: Mars.The wound of the warrior-God, Ares, the Greek’s Mars, was real.But this immediately provokes two questions, the first of which was asked byTalbott himself:> 1. “Could something as massive as Valles Marineris have been carved by> interplanetary lightning?”118> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1072890]> 2. Did someone - humans or otherwise - actually observe the event from Earth> or elsewhere, and record the event? While the first question indicates that one feature of Talbott and Thornhill’shypothesis is that these discharges are evidences of gigantic, solar system wideinterplanetary “arcing” from a time when the solar system was very young andelectrically dynamic, it is important not to lose sight of the question itself:could such a geological feature, massive as it is, be carved by electricaldischarge? “Could Valles Marineris have been caused by a thunderbolt?” Talbottasked Thornhill.119 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1073031]> Thornhill replied, “It couldn’t have been anything else.”> “...Valles Marineris was created within minutes by a giant electric arc> sweeping across the surface of Mars,” Thornhill claims. “The rock and soil> were lifted into space. Some of it fell back around the planet to create the> great, strewn fields of boulders seen by both Viking Landers and> Pathfinder.”120 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1073333] The “mighty chasm” of Valles Marineris thus “represents the confluence of twoworldviews: the dramatic, historical worldview of mythology and the objective,physical worldview of science.”121[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1073482]If that is so, however, it raises the second question in no uncertain terms. Howis it that ancient mythology, art, and petroglyphic symbols can preserve thelegend of planetary scarring, can accurately record the very shape of complexplasma filaments, of stacked toruses, intertwining currents, and of plasmapinching effects?There are only three real possibilities:> 1. The ancients possessed a plasma cosmology and physics themselves, and from> laboratory experiments, were well familiar with the patterns exhibited by> Peratt’s petroglyphs. They chose, for some strange reason, to disguise their> knowledge by creating myths and legends in archaic petroglyphs and> mythological symbols. But this implies a technology at least as advanced as> our own in order to create plasma effects of the type observed to begin with.> 2. Someone else possessed all these things, and actually transmitted this> knowledge to ancient man, who subsequently embellished the basic conceptions> with mythological hyperbole.> 3. Ancient man actually observed and more or less accurately recorded what he> saw in myth, artistic symbol, and in the petroglyphs. Regardless of which version one opts for, one is left with another disquietingaspect of “The Problem of Peratt,” and that is, that whatever catastrophes asancient mankind appeared to witness and record in his art and mythologicalarchetypes, the catastrophes witnessed appear to fall outside the chronologicalparameters both of Van Flandern’s Exploded Planet Hypothesis and Hannes Alfvén’selectrically dynamic solar system, for in both cases the events or conditionsdescribed in those hypotheses happened some millions of years ago. Yet theartistic symbols, the myths, and Peratt’s petroglyphs themselves are all onlythousands of years old.Any way one slices it, various sciences are involved in the contradiction, inthe problematic inherent in the “Problem of Peratt,” for on the one hand, ifhumans observed these events, then either the described events are much morerecent than the two physics theories that can account for them will allow, ormankind is of far greater antiquity than contemporary paleontology,anthropology, and historical theory will allow.122[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1073623] In the latter case,an additional problem arises, for it would imply that mankind preserved hisartistic and mythological archetypes with amazing consistency and accuracy overseveral million years.It is this accuracy of the artistic record - of the petroglyphs and ancient artwork depicting the “divine weapons” by capturing the subtleties of plasmadischarges - that is itself problematic for the catastrophist view, espousedmost brilliantly by scholar Alan Alford as we shall see in the next chapter,that would then in turn maintain that all mythological references to the Wars ofthe Gods are but metaphors for an exploded planet cult. If that were so, why didthe ancients, who were certainly capable of depicting planets as circular orbs,not depict them as such? Why give them arms and legs and faces and beards, andthunderbolts that are amazingly accurate depictions of electrical plasmaphenomena? And why give the gods not only the technology for such massivedisplays of power, but ascribe to them personalities and motivations to use it?Why indeed, unless they are describing real events in a real war."},{"pageContent":"E. CONCLUSIONS Whatever one makes of the above questions and considerations, a number ofimportant things have emerged in the investigation thus far.> 1. Plasma discharge phenomena can account for the vorticular geometry of> entire galaxies as well as phenomena that can be simulated and reproduced in a> laboratory.> 2. These phenomena may be accessed in part by the technology of a plasma focus> device, which exhibits both peculiar anti-gravitational “electro-gravitic”> effects as well as weaponizable effects, from fusion, to explosion, to streams> of high energy negative and heavy ionic radiation.> 3. Such plasma phenomena additionally appear to be intricately linked to even> more fundamental scalar physics properties via the non-linear and rotational> properties of plasmoids. Given that such plasma phenomena may be accessed by> technology, as in point 2 above, it is then conceivable that the phenomena may> be coupled to or accessed at a celestial scale, and weaponized at that> scale.123 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1074152]> 4. Celestially scaled plasma discharge phenomena appear to have been recorded,> if not witnessed, by ancient mankind in a variety of mythological symbols,> petroglyphs, and legends.> 5. In certain cases these myths actually point to the planet Mars, ancient> “god of war”, as being the central location for some of these phenomena.124> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1074651] One has with plasma phenomena, on the one hand then, a physics sufficient to thetask of significantly scarring, if not exploding, a planet, a basic technologyin the plasma focus that can access some of the most significant phenomena ofplasmas, and on the other hand a mythological tradition that clearly andunequivocally maintains that this physics was once accessed, used in a war forthe deliberate destruction of one or more planets, and for the massive scarringof the surface of another, leaving its collateral damage strewn throughout thesolar system.It seems to me that there might be a fundamental difficulty with plasmacosmology, and this is its maintenance that vast electrical-plasma filamentsconnect and bind together whole galaxies in galactic clusters. But such bondingcould only occur at the velocity of light, and would therefore seem insufficientas a basis of their bonding. Something else must therefore be transferringinformation between galaxies in order to form these clusters in such a way thatthe filamentary connections of galaxies emerge as its signature. Thus, extendingthis speculation a bit further, it might be that the phenomenon of galacticclusters and their filamentary bonding is a large scale version of photonentanglement, and a very large demonstration of the non-local nature of themedium. In this, then, plasma cosmology would seem to point to an even deeperphysics, which we have followed Bearden in calling “scalar” physics. As thischapter has averred, the connection between the two models is quite strong.But why would ancient mankind employ such a diffuse and complex symbolism toconvey all these things? And when broken down to its basic motifs, whatconstitutes the various layers of that symbolism? As will be seen in the nextchapter, the second question is actually the means to answer the first...."},{"pageContent":"3.

THE CATASTROPHIST PROBLEMATIC Ever since Immanuel Velikovsky first wrote his classic masterpiece Worlds inCollision, catastrophism has been the dominant model in the paleophysicalinterpretation of ancient myths. Indeed, Velikovsky’s book was perhaps the firstreal attempt to do what I call “paleophysics,” that is, an examination ofancient mythological texts and legends for the possibility that they encodescientific, physics related knowledge and a comparison of that knowledge withexisting scientific theory. Velikovsky’s goal was, for all that, not scientificbut historical, for he sought to illumine overlooked areas of cosmologicalhistory. Nonetheless, his works - notwithstanding the outcry against them from ascientific priesthood locked into its own astronomical dogmas - struck anelegant balance between science and history that has not been exceeded by any,and equaled by none but a few.Where Velikovsky earned - even if undeservedly - the ire of the “scientific”community was his use of the ancient mythological texts to make scientificpredictions and to formulate new scientific hypotheses, the two most famousbeing his assertion that Venus was once a large comet, and that the solar systemwas not electrically neutral. As physicist Anthony Peratt and others in theplasma physics school have amply demonstrated and ably argued, the latterhypothesis appears to have some support within contemporary thinking. Sowhatever one makes of Velikovsky’s hypothesis that Venus was once a comet, hestands at least partially vindicated. And if the work of Clube and Napier andothers regarding meteor and comet impacts and near misses, or if Van Flanden’sMultiple Exploded Planets hypothesis is considered, then even Velikovsky’sformer hypothesis appears partially vindicated as well: comets can, andmoreover, did, wreak untold destruction in the solar system subsequent to theinitial planetary explosion. But the problem of explaining that initialexplosion remains.What Velikovsky discerned, in ancient legends spanning the globe from the Mayansto the Hebrews, was a discernible pattern of celestial, cosmic catastrophe thathad dire consequences for the earth’s life, climate, geography, topography, andeven its own celestial mechanics. His examination of these mythologicaltraditions led him to observe “A torrent of large stones coming from the sky, anearthquake, a whirlwind, a disturbance in the movement of the earth - these fourphenomena belong together.”127[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1075255] But it was whatVelikovsky discerned as the cause of these phenomena that gave birth to a wholenew school of reading such ancient texts and interpreting them as containingelements of science:> It appears that a large comet must have passed very near to our planet and> disrupted its movement; a part of the stones dispersed in the neck and tail of> the comet smote the surface of our earth a shattering blow.128> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1075437] These words gave birth to a whole new school of mythological interpretation -catastrophism - and one need only replace the word “comet” in the abovequotation with “meteor” or “asteroid” and one will have its contemporaryversion.Many have followed in Velikovsky’s footsteps, but none is more capable nor asbroadly read as is Alan Alford, who is perhaps the most learned and articulatespokesman for this school."},{"pageContent":"1. THE INTERPRETIVE PARADIGM OF ALAN ALFORD Alford’s case for catastrophism is ably set out in three masterful tomes: ThePhoenix Solution: Secrets of a Lost Civilisation, The Atlantis Secret: AComplete Decoding of Plato’s Lost Continent, and perhaps the most importantstudy of the three, When the Gods Came Down: The Catastrophic Roots of ReligionRevealed. Indeed, as the last title reveals, Alford’s intention is somewhatdifferent than Velikovsky’s, though both men consult a similar range of texts.Whereas Velikovsky aims merely at explaining a broad cosmological history interms of the physics that his texts suggest, Alford’s aim is narrower, seekingto explain the origin of those myths and texts, and the religions based uponthem. In other words, for most catastrophists, the paradigm is used to explaincertain types of physical evidences, and certain types of statements in texts,on the basis of physical theory. In a new twist on philosophical naturalism andmaterialism, however, Alford uses the catastrophist paleophysical paradigm toexplain the origin of religions and certain types of expressions in religioustexts themselves.This caveat notwithstanding, it is safe to say Alford’s works constitute themost scholarly and well-researched continuation of the catastrophist paradigm ofmythological interpretation since Velikovsky first gave it textual flesh andbones. Here our concentration will be on his Atlantis Secret and When the GodsCame Down, for it is in these works that he makes the most sweeping claims forthe interpretive power of this paradigm. Indeed, in The Atlantis Secret Alfordis quite explicit about the universal explanatory power that he claims for hisversion of catastrophism:> In this book, I present not only a complete decoding of the lost continent of> Atlantis, but also a complete decoding of ancient Greek religion in its> entirety. I am able to decode the myths of the Olympian gods and their> associated mystery cults; I am able to decode the myth of the golden age and> the fall of man; I am able to to decode the scientific cosmogonies of Thales,> Anaximander, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Empedocles and Philolaos; I am able to> decode the ‘soul religion’ of Orpheus, Pythagroas, Parmenides, Socrates and> Plato; and I am able to decode Plato’s Theory of Forms, his account of> creation by the Demiourgos, and his story of Atlantis. Behind all of these> ideas there lies a single secret of stunning simplicity - the age-old myth of> exploded planet. 129> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1075578] In other words, behind all the complex imagery and themes of the Greeks, behindall their arcane and well-reasoned philosophy, behind all the arcane rituals oftheir mystery schools, lies one simple conceptfor which they are all metaphors and allegories: all of it is but “the age-oldmyth of the exploded planet.”But lest one think that the catastrophist paradigm is restricted merely to theGreeks, Alford pointedly states that the same applies to the other religions ofthe region: “The religions of the ancient Near East are best described as‘exploded planet cults,’”130[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1075776] even, as we shallsee, Judaism and Christianity in their very core doctrines. Lest one think thatAlford is unaware of the sweeping nature of his claims for the universalexplanatory power of the catastrophist paradigm, he spells it out explicitly:> • The exploded planet was invisible by nature, thus explaining the ancients’> worship of visible substitutes - meteorites, statues, fertility-gods,> weather-gods, Sun, Moon and stars.> • The worship of the gods in anthropomorphic form was an entirely predictable> offshoot of the exploded planet cult.> • The exploded planet cult was as profound as profound gets, involving the> death of a living planet and the rebirth of life on another planet - the> Earth. There is no need to suppose any deeper, hidden meaning to the ancient> myths.> • The mythical (Exploded Planet Hypothesis) is entirely separate from the> scientific (Exploded Planet Hypothesis) and does not require the actual> explosion of a planet. There is no law that requires ancient religious beliefs> to be scientifically true.131> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1075955] However, it is this last point that highlights the problematic inherent inAlford’s version of catastrophism, and indeed inherent in most catastrophistinterpretations of ancient myths, and that is, if the texts are not to becorrelated with any scientific theory - ancient or modern - of an explodedplanet in nearby space, then how and why would the ancients, across such a broaddiversity of cultures and dispersion of this one theme, hit upon the idea in thefirst place? And if this scenario is, as Alford says, “one of a ... world thatwas once saturated with the cults of numerous exploded planet deities, eachpersonifying exactly the same idea, but expressed in a variety of differentways,”132 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1076096] then whyemploy such a confused jungle overgrowth of symbols to portray it? The ancients,on Alford’s problematical view, were obsessed across cultures and religions withthis one idea to such an extent that this obsession itself must be explained. Aswill be seen, this, too is another problematic inherent in Alford’s approach.A. CHIMERAS AS METEORITES Alford produces a veritable blizzard of thematic motifs and references in hisbooks in support of his contention that most if not all such motifs refer to the“hidden” truth of an exploded planet. A basic formula, however, underlies allthe motifs he explores in his works, and that is that anything referring tomountains, cities, or islands in the “sea” or “the deep” is a metaphor for aplanet, which is an “island” or “mountain” in the midst of the “deep” or “sea”of space.This formula has a corollary: anything chimerical or of a “hybrid” nature“,particularly if it involves a heavenly component and an earthly one - theNephilim or “sons of God” who sired chimerical giant offspring with human womenin the Old Testament for example - is a meteorite, since a meteorite, as aremnant of the exploded planet, has both a heavenly component since it fell fromheaven, and an earthly one, since it fell to, and in some cases, penetratedunder, the surface of the earth.Accordingly, as Alford explicitly states, “it is worth mentioning that even theSphinx - a supreme solar symbol in the eyes of Egyptologists - was actually anexploded planet symbol.”133[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1076246]B. GIANTS AND TITANS AS METEORITES Similarly, even the hero of the Babylonian epic Gilgamesh becomes a similarsymbol, for as the epic itself states, “Two thirds of him is god and one thirdof him is man.”134 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1076429]Since Gilgamesh was also a “giant” according to the Babylonian epic, the meaningof the symbol thus becomes crystal clear for Alford:> Once we marry up this information with the other legends of Gilgamesh’s> Titan-like birth, together with the fact that the senior gods were exploded> planets, it becomes evident that the “flesh of the gods” was the meteorite> efflux of the gods. The name Gilgamesh, then, meant “meteorite...”135> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1076663] So far so good, but the reader may perhaps have already detected a difficultywith Alford’s methodology: there are no external controls or checks on it. Oncehis basic formula is unleashed on mythological texts, anything fitting itsgeneral parameters becomes a symbol of the catastrophism of an exploded planet.C. PLANETARY COLLISIONS AS WARS Thus, when ancient mythological texts speak of the “wars” of the gods, they arespeaking of the “collisions” of celestial bodies, notwithstanding the fact thatnot all ancient texts can be construed as collisions between objects. In otherwords, while it is certainly true that some ancient texts speak of divine“arrows” and “stones” or “missiles” being used to slay some divine opponent, notall war references include these types of weapons. Just as often mythologicaltexts speak of the “lightning” or “bolt” of the gods, and even the theme of“divine arrows” could be a metaphor for lightning discharges. Thus, Alford’sformula begins to show a subtle crack. Nonetheless, there is a consistency withwhich he applies it, for the “children” of the “gods” then become the meteorsand asteroids that crash to the earth.For example, the “‘people’ who came forth from the womb of the goddess Ishtarwere not really ‘people’ at all - they were the meteorite offspring from anexploding planetary body. ”136[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1076846]D. THE ULTIMATE REDUCTIO Alford’s catastrophism knows no bounds. Even “Noah was not a man but a god - afallen meteorite.”137[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1077022] And if that were notenough, Alford reaches his ultimate reductio ad absurdum with the followingpassage:> How would the Church explain the fact that Jesus Christ was originally a> physical flood of meteorites?> > > > > > And, if this long-hidden-aspect of Jesus Christ was revealed, how would the> Church explain the role of Jesus-the-man from the 1st century AD? Would the> Church admit that Jesus-the-man was an actor in a Mystery Play or Passion> play? Would the Church acknowledge that the crucifixion was in fact an> ingenious esoteric parable for the death of a planet?> The mind absolutely boggles at the thought of all this.138> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1077172]Yes indeed, the mind truly does boggle at the thought of all this, for it wouldseem that, following his well-footnoted formula with the absolute devotion of afundamentalist, one can interpret literally all mythological references orreligious texts in such a manner as to construe it as referring to nothing morethan an exploded planet.But - if I may be permitted to paraphrase the Christian apologist C.S. Lewis fora moment - to see through everything is to see nothing at all; there must besome opacity to the text.Thus, how would Alford explain the fact, referred to in my book The Giza DeathStar Destroyed, that these same planets-as-gods then go on to sire very humanoffspring and teach them the various arts and sciences necessary tocivilization, as those very same texts, across several cultural traditions,attest? Alford’s answer is to maintain that this meteoric bombardment seeded theearth with life which then evolved, via the familiar mechanisms of “evolution,”into mankind.So how does one answer someone like Alford?Very simply.If all the textual references to giants, titans, Nephilim, Anunnaki and so onare nothing but cleverly concocted metaphors for an exploded planet, and thusnot real, then one should never be able to find any evidence or ancient artifactof intelligent life on nearby planets, nor any evidence of giants, titans, andsuch on earth. If, however, such things are found, then by the very nature ofthe sweeping and universal explanatory power that Alford claims for his “method”of interpreting the texts, these things would constitute loose corroboration ofmy own reading of the texts, and the fatal “exception” to Alford’s claims, forto claim universal validity and powers of explanation is to claim no exceptions.We shall turn to the evidence for the existence of ancient giants in the nextchapter.E. AN INTRIGUING FORMULA: GODS EQUAL MOUNTAINS EQUAL PLANETS Here we shall concentrate on the implication of the discovery of ancientextraterrestrial artifacts of intelligent life for Alford’s hypothesis, byfocusing on the significant, and truly important and legitimate insight thatAlford makes regarding the equation “mountains equal planets equal gods.”Referring to the fact that Mesopotamian texts often refer to the god Enlil as“the Great Mountain” who engenders the four seasons, Alford then makes thefollowing insightful observation: “It must be said that the idea of summer andwinter being engendered upon a ‘mountain’ only makes sense if the ‘mountain’ inquestion was the entire planet of Earth.”139[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1077355] Thus one arrives ata significant formula that guides Alford (and as we shall see in later chapters,contains another constant or variable that Alford does not take into account).That formula is, once again, “mountains equal planets equal gods.” And I meanthe word “equals” here in its entire logical and ontological significance; if“a” equals “b” and “b” equals “c”, then by the laws of logic and commutivity,“a” equals “c”."},{"pageContent":"B. A RETURN TO THE CATASTROPHIST PROBLEMATIC Is this formula true? Or has Alford misconstrued close association orapproximation in the texts of those three components with equality and identity?Is the formula this:> Mountains ≡ planets ≡ gods,where “≡” means “is identical to”, or this:> Mountains ≈ planets ≈ gods,where “≈” means “is closely associated with”?If the latter, then the three things, while closely related in the text, remaindistinct, requiring not the reduction of various levels of meaning in the textsto one prosaic and materialistic level, as with Alford’s formula, but rather thecareful unpacking of several intertwined levels of meaning. This brings us tosomething I discussed briefly in my book The Giza Death Star Destroyed:"},{"pageContent":"1. THE UNIFIED INTENTION OF SYMBOL To understand how the difference in formulas works, and to understand how theformulas require some external check or grounding, let us return to the plasmacosmology and the observations of physicist Anthony Peratt and the ancientpetroglyphs.While Peratt’s interpretations of petroglyphs as symbols of plasma stabilitiesand instabilities are compelling, and give new weight to the plasma cosmologyfrom the paleographical context, there is a significant problematic, whichpresents itself in two fundamental ways: (1) a cosmological and physicscomponent, and (2) a textual component.The cosmological and physics component may best be examined by noting oneimplication of the “catastrophist” interpretation of plasma cosmology, forduring the age of the “interplanetary discharges,” a very different picture ofcelestial mechanics would have been necessitated:> According to Talbott, what the ancients worshipped and feared as powerful gods> were planets positioned extremely close to the Earth. This close congregation> of planets appeared as huge powers in the sky. Their instabilities and> unpredictable movements gave rise to one of the most common themes of myth -> the wars of the gods. In these dramatic stories, the gods pounded each other> with cosmic lightning while fire and stone descended on Earth.140> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1077537] This is as succinct a statement of both aspects of the problematic as one couldwish for.In it, one encounters the familiar catastrophist theme of the interpretation ofthe names of gods as metaphors for planets. But note the implication of thisinterpretation for the rest of the textual evidence of ancient mythologies, forthe metaphor “bleeds into” that of the “wars of the gods,” a common theme inancient myths. As I noted in my book The Giza Death Star Destroyed, this wouldbe a plausible interpretation were it not for the fact that many of these samemythological cultures then continue the “story” by having these gods marry andsire, or mother, children.141[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1077751] This too, as I notedthere, would be capable of a plausible catastrophist interpretation were it notfor the fact that these children, through similar marriages, eventually becomethe ancestors to very real, very human, flesh and blood ancient kings. In otherwords, the metaphor was “mixed” in the very worst fashion, reminiscent of themost hackneyed and clumsy schoolboy compositional exercise. So much, for themoment, for the “textual” component of the problematic.What is of great significance is the cosmological component alluded to, for asis clear, in the standard electro-dynamic plasma cosmology view of these “wars”,the planets were once, in the very distant past, much closer to each other andtherefore much more electrically active and unstable. And this highlights thedifficulty, for if this were the case, then what mechanism would have led fromthis initial chaotic condition to the condition of the relatively stablecelestial mechanics in evidence now? More importantly, what process ofextrapolation, from the observable existing “stability” of the local celestialsystem backwards to the paleoancient chaotic one, could have led the myth makersto such an exact and apparently accurate description of these ancient events?Talbott and Thornhill state this problem in the following way:> How stable was the solar system in the past? In the pioneering work of Hannes> Alfvén and his successors, orbital instability is a virtual certainty in the> long-term evolution of an electrical model. In the birth of stellar and> planetary systems, the electric force will typically dominate. But as the> system dissipates electrical energy, it will reach a transitional phase at> which a shift toward gravitational supremacy will occur, with potentially> violent consequences. A chaotic system will then move toward stable electrical> and gravitational equilibrium. Once planets achieve predictable orbits, no> computer simulation based on later motions of the planets can provide even a> clue as to the earlier system or its disruption.142> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1077939] In answer to this problem, we are left with two choices: (1) either thecelestial science of the ancients was considerably more advanced than werealize, such that it possessed such a theoretical model that allowed suchextrapolations to be made, a thesis that, if true, would make their science muchmore advanced than our own; or (2) human myth-makers were telling stories thatthey had received, and ultimately the events that the myths described weretherefore observed by intelligent entities (and/or mankind) and passed down tosubsequent humanity.This last possibility raises two further, and equally important, and equallyproblematic questions. Either the events were (1) observed by humans, or (2)were observed by non-human intelligent life (either in conjunction with humanobservers, or not) and then subsequently communicated to man. The first isproblematical for the simple reason that it implies an antiquity and culturalsophistication for humanity quite at variance with standard academic theory ofthe biological and cultural evolution of mankind, since the events describedwould be on the order of millions if not billions of years old. The second isproblematic for a similar reason, and additionally so, for it implies an“interventionist” origin for human culture, and perhaps for humanity itself. Butadditionally, it is problematic for the simple reason that this interventionistview is what most of the ancient myths themselves state!The two components of this problematic - the cosmology-physics and the(con)textual - are not unrelated nor even loosely so, for lacking a plausiblephysical model of celestial mechanics that could bridge the gap between thepaleoancient “chaos” to the present “order”,143[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1078137] the texts andmythical traditions themselves indicate the answer to this question in nouncertain terms, for a real war would be able to do just that.But that, of course, implies real people to fight the war, and real weapons oftruly cosmic proportions, to fight it with.To appreciate the significance of the war scenario, one may refer to thechronological questions it both resolves and the new chronological questions itraises. On the one hand, if one takes the “war” scenario seriously, then thereis no need to assume the “cosmic catastrophes” that the myths describe as havingto do with the initial chaotic conditions of the entire universe. In otherwords, there is no need to push the events back into the remotest past ofbillions of years ago, during the electrically stormy period of the universe’sinitial formation. Indeed, the “chaotic” conditions it describes need notindicate anything at all about the “normative celestial mechanics” of the periodin which the events described occur, since such chaotic conditions could beimposed upon the otherwise normal and regular celestial mechanics of any localsolar system by a society possessed of a sufficiently advanced physics to do so,and a technology capable of weaponizing that physics. Such physics, if itexisted at all, could be imposed on any regularly ordered celestial system,including our own, thus making it appear for the moment to be chaotic. We maytherefore not be dealing with events that transpired some billions of years ago,but with events that occurred “mere” millions of years ago.Once this highly speculative concept is entertained, it opens the door to aresolution of other chronological issues, for it allows the war to have occurredat any stage that such a society might have emerged. In short, and barring theconsideration of other types of evidence for the moment, the door is open forthe cosmic cataclysm to occur anywhere from millions, to mere thousands, ofyears ago. And as has already been seen from the evidence presented in thischapter, there are two loci around which a chronological resolution must beorbited: on the one hand, it must account for the existing planetary data ofsuch a catastrophe, from the asteroid belt as remnants of a missing explodedplanet in our solar system, to the electrical discharge scarring on the variousmoons and planets - most notably Mars - in our solar system. The evidence, inother words, precludes that catastrophist interpretation which would see themyths as describing the chaotic conditions at the origins of the solar system.The evidence necessitates a much later dating, for once one adds intelligentobservers into the mix to observe and record these events, one perforce cannotbe dealing with the primordial conditions of the solar system. As will be seeneventually, the petroglyphic evidence compiled by Peratt, and the textualevidence of the myths themselves, fix another terminus a few thousands or tensof thousands of years ago.When these thoughts are seriously entertained, they lead to an almost inexorablyinescapable conclusion: if one must take such texts and cultural traditionsseriously when it comes to planetary cataclysm, as the catastrophistsconsistently maintain, then perhaps it is time to take the same texts andtraditions equally seriously and consistently when they talk of the wars thatcaused the catastrophes in the first place, and when they refer to themotivations and consequences for those wars.A. FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS OF THE UNIFIED INTENTION OF SYMBOL This raises the question of what is meant by “the unified intention of symbol.”Basically, I mean this terminology to indicate that the multi-leveled nature atwhich mythological symbols operate were originally chosen and intended tooperate in such a fashion by the creators of those myths. The phrase means,then, the exact opposite of what one encounters in Alan Alford’s work. WhereAlford would have us reduce and identify several symbolic motifs and impliedlayers of meaning to one layer of meaning - that of the exploded planet - theancients employed individual symbols or motifs in constellations andarrangements designed to unfold into several layers of meaning.In this respect it would be useful to review what I wrote concerning this verysame subject in The Giza Death Star Destroyed.> What are we to make of all this textual ambiguity that permits of so many> different, well-argued interpretations? One could maintain that each> hypothesis remains open until more evidence is known, until such time as a> determination may be made between them. However, it is my belief that this> interpretive ambiguity is intentional and original to the case, the deliberate> contrivance of some paleoancient “elite” to preserve knowledge. That is to> say, it would appear that the gods’ names, lengths of reigns, genealogies and> bloodlines, the record of an interplanetary war and resulting recurrent> catastrophism, and paleophysical astronomical and quantum and> sub-quantum-mechanical “secrets” were all deliberately combined in a densely> packed, multi-leveled symbolism designed to convey accurate knowledge of all> of these things simultaneously. These densely packed symbols are a device to> preserve simultaneously the bloodline records, the interplanetary war and the> origins of the current structure of the solar system, the necessary> astronomical, physical, mathematical knowledge (and, by implication, the> technology) by initiates into the Egyptian mysteries who doubtless did not> know the full significance of their own religious esoteric tradition. That the> texts intentionally combine all the religious, cosmological and quantum> mechanical data along with dynastic wars is itself a corroboration of the type> of unified physics I believe the Great Pyramid itself attests to. That> ambiguity results from their interpretation should come as no surprise.144> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1079362]> I call this resulting, and intentional ambiguity the ‘Unified Intention of> Symbol,’ since one of its implications is that the contradiction between the> interpretation of real war and that of naturally recurring catastrophe is only> an apparent contradiction.” 145> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1079756] B. THE EMERGENCE OF THE UNIFIED INTENTION OF SYMBOL FROM THE ANALOGICAL METHOD One may easily see how this unified intentionality of the complex andinterrelated layers of mythological symbolism might have arisen from theanalogical habit of thinking of ancient cultures itself. Indeed, if that habitof thinking in turn arose out of the sophisticated physics of its paleoancientprecursor Very High Civilization, then it is also relatively easy to see why thespiritual and physics components of those myths were blended almost from thestart."},{"pageContent":"1. THE PALEOPHYSICAL HERMENEUTIC: CATASTROPHE METAPHOR VS. REAL WAR With these thoughts in mind a comparison of catastrophism versus the “real war”hermeneutic (explanation) is in order.Clearly, catastrophism and “real war” are both paleophysical interpretiveparadigms, that is, they both attempt to make sense of ancient legends andstories by means of a comparison of the claims of those texts and the models ofmodern science. Here, however, catastrophism and “real war” diverge on a numberof points.For the “real war” hermeneutic, the texts only make consistent sense if takenmore or less as asserting an underlying reality to the events described. Inother words:> (1) the war was real;> (2) the people or “gods” who fought it were real;> (3) these people had real motivations for doing so, i.e., there is an> underlying social order that was threatened by some perceived enemy, and a> political agenda was at work;> (4) it was fought with real, and horrendously powerful weapons of mass> destruction on a planetary scale, including, weather weapons; thus, the> exploded planet hypothesis is used merely to explain certain texts as a> limited event;> (5) there were real winners and losers;> (6) these people or “gods” in some cases prior to, in some cases during, and> in some cases after the war, then initiated a contact with humanity and began> to interfere in its affairs, to the point of siring and initiating human> civilizations and their dynasties. For the “catastrophist” explanation, however, especially as exemplified in thepopular work of Alan Alford, the following interesting thing begins to happen:> (1) the exploded planet hypothesis is used to interpret references to “wars of> the gods” as a metaphor for colliding planets;> (2) the exploded planet hypothesis is used to interpret references in texts to> the unions or marriages of the gods as metaphors for colliding planets;> (3) the exploded planet hypothesis is used to interpret the children of such> marriages as metaphors for the debris of those collisions;> (4) the exploded planet hypothesis is used to interpret references of mixed> heavenly and earthly origins of people(e.g. Adam, or the Nephilim in the Old> Testament) as meaning this debris fell to earth - in yet more planetary> collisions and impacts - and seeded life on earth. In other words, the catastrophist use of the exploded planet hypothesis -especially in the hands of an Alan Alford, becomes a way to view almost everytextual theme in such legends as a metaphor of what he calls “the explodedplanet cult.” This is as true of Plato in his allegory of Atlantis, to theHebrew priests who compiled the Old Testament, to the Sanskrit scribes whocomposed the Hindu epics.The tendency “to see through everything” in the texts in catastrophism is a realone, for by seeing through everything, one is in real danger of seeing nothingat all to paraphrase C.S. Lewis once again. If there is no opacity to the texts,there is nothing to see. On Alford’s approach, one would have to understand evencomic books such as Superman to nothing but “cleverly disguised propaganda” forthe exploded planet cult. One might view coffee with cream and sugar as a“mixture,” as a “chimera”, and thus as a symbol of “meteorites” and explodedplanets. One might view the current genetic chimeras of biologists and geneticengineers as a vast new program of symbols for the exploded planet, and so onand so forth. In the face of modern technologies that recapture the imagesrecounted, Alford’s catastrophism reduces to ridiculousness, for hisinterpretive paradigm must explain them on the very same basis, as nothing morethan manifestations of the exploded planet religion.As interpretive approaches to paleophysics, then, no two schools could befarther apart than the catastrophist school and the “real war” school for a veryobvious methodological reason. In the former, one particular modern physicsmodel, the exploded planet hypothesis itself, is used to interpret most if notall textual themes as metaphors for that one thing. In the latter, however,different modern physics models, from “scalar physics” to the “exploded planethypothesis” to “plasma cosmology” are used to find correspondences betweenspecific textual references and the modern model with a view to testing theaccuracy of those texts and their various assertions. Moreover, other areas ofscience are employed to make sense of other portions of the textual traditions,as, for example, in the use of genetic engineering to explain the occurrence ofchimeras in those texts.While both paleophysical approaches certainly challenge standard models ofscience and history, one may safely maintain that the catastrophist modelexemplified in the works of Alford, the most popular and careful of thecatastrophists, leads everywhere and nowhere all at once. It is difficult toconceive what sort of predictions it makes, other then to make predictions thatmore such metaphors can be found, and found almost anywhere. It ends by beingnothing more than a well-footnoted compendium of the various types of metaphorsfor the one and only model it is willing to consider: the exploded planethypothesis itself.The “real war” model, in contradistinction from this, does not run quite soroughshod over the texts it considers, and moreover is able to make aprediction, namely, that artificial artifacts of the civilization that foughtthat war might be found and conclusively documented. And, as we shall discoverin part two, there is yet another variable in the formula:> Mountains ≈ planets ≈ gods ≈ “X”. For now it is best to leave that “X” factor unstated. But once discovered andarticulated, we shall see that it spells the death knell for Alford’s convenientreductionism.In any case, such artifacts might be structures in the desert, to structures onother planetary bodies that evidence some type of machining or intelligentorigin, to residual evidences within earthly DNA that indicate some priormanipulation, or the remains of some strange humanoid creature that is anomalousin some way, from its appearance to its size. To this last subject, giants, wenow turn."},{"pageContent":"4.

They have alsosuggested, if it was home to intelligent human-like life, that this explodedplanet - “Tiamat” - may have required such life to have relatively largerphysiognomies due to its higher gravity. In short, its “men” may have beengiants. Such a “literal” confirmation of ancient myths with their numerousreferences to chimerical giants would likewise contraindicate the catastrophistinterpretation of Alford.The myths state that this giant race, or its precursor, “came down from heaven,”literally, and interacted with mankind, a thesis that, if true, would seem topredict a very odd kind of corroboration: there should exist both remains ofsuch creatures, as well as testimony to their existence.Fortunately there is a wealth of testimony, and some very suggestive evidence inthe form of remains, concerning the existence, and strange features, of thesegiants."},{"pageContent":"A. ANCIENT TESTIMONY TO THE EXISTENCE OF GIANTS"},{"pageContent":"1. THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH FATHERS No less than that dour exponent of divine predestination and the most importantchurch father for the Latin Mediaeval Catholicism of the Western Church, SaintAugustine of Hippo Regius, wrote an entire treatise devoted to the subject ofgiants entitled “Concerning the Long life of Men before the Flood, and theGreater Size of Their Bodies.” The title is indicative of its contents, for itseems to reflect one strand of an ancient tradition within Christianity, goingback to its Jewish roots, that mankind was once not only much longer-lived, butalso of much larger physical stature. Augustine observes that> ...some indeed do not believe that men’s bodies were formerly much greater> than now.... But concerning the magnitude of their bodies, the graves laid> bare by age or the force of rivers and various accidents especially convict> the incredulous, where they have come to light, or where bones of the dead of> incredible magnitude have fallen, as I have seen, and not I alone, on the> shore by Utica, so huge a molar tooth of a man, that were it cut up into small> models of teeth like ours, it would seem enough to make a hundred of them.

The Gomarian giants actually can be traced into Greekmythology and, as such, were actual individuals who were giants and who weretreated as gods. Thus, far from being simply myths, it is possible to trace someof the Greek gods to actual historical figures.”153[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1081592]But how is this possible?Because Acmon’s son, Uranus, who succeeded him in ruling their new conquests,was himself worshipped by his subjects as “a Man of Heaven.”154[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1081742] As Pezron goes on tonote, the ancient author Simias of Rhodes gave Uranus the name “Acmonides,” or“son of Acmon,” an opinion that Hesychius shared.155[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1081883] In other words,“from this single family of giant Gomarian princes came ‘those who have passedfor the greatest and ancientest (sic) gods of the heathen world.”’156[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1082033] So it would appearthat the opinions of some Church fathers and other early ecclesiastical writersis not without its classical antecedents."},{"pageContent":"2. CLASSICAL SOURCES But there is more to this story, for “while the minute (and often erroneous)stories of Nero and his fiddle and Julius Caesar and Brutus continue to be told,something as amazing as the fact that Roman legions on occasion battled giantsoldiers has been covered up.”157[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1082205] Indeed, no less thanthe famous Roman historian and man of letters Pliny the Elder reported that thebones of one such giant, who had been observed by the Romans while he was alive,had been “brought by Marcus Scaurus from Joppa in Judea... The monster was over40 feet long, and the height of its ribs was greater than that of Indianelephants, while its spine was 1 ½ feet thick.”158[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1082366]In fact, ever since Rome cast its imperial eyes in the form of Julius Caesar onthe conquest of Gaul, the disciplined Roman legions seem to have been dogged byencounters with the Northern branch of the Gomarians, that branch that migratedinto Europe. Here, the legions ran into the stock of a new and formidable enemy:the Celts, and their cousins, the Teutons, or Germans.This new enemy was something different than Rome had ever faced, and Rome hadfaced quite a bit, from Hannibal’s Carthaginian armies with its war elephants,to all manner of intrigue and scheming.> Not a lot is known about the people who would become known as the Celts. It is> known that they migrated across Asia Minor, through northern Europe and into> what have become the Celtic countries of Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Most> accounts of them include references to the giants that were often found among> them. The ancient Greek historian, Pausainias, called them “the world’s> tallest people.” Modern historians now believe that, in fact, the giants among> the Celts were a ruling class that held control over the indigenous population> that formed the majority of Celtic tribes.> (The) modern historian, Gerhard Herm, agrees that the Celts were “blond> giants” who struck terror in the hearts of every foe, even in the mightiest of> mighty Rome. As such, the Celts fought several ferocious wars with Rome and> captured, sacked, and burnt many Roman outposts to the ground. Although the> Romans would eventually devise methods of defeating these giant warriors,> attacking long legs that couldn’t be guarded by the massive shields these> creatures carried, the blue-eyed, blond giants inspired terror among those> facing them in battle for the first time.159> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1082615] The unusual size reported for the Celts was not a feature noted merely by Romanhistorians in the wake of the conquest of Gaul. The Greek historians Arrian andDiodorus also comment on their unusually large size, Arrian mentioning them inconnection with Alexander the Great’s encounter with them after he had burneddown one of their cities on the Danube in 335 BC.160[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1082775] Moreover, whenAlexander queried the Celts as to what their worst fear was, they gave him thestrangely intriguing answer that their worst fear was “that the sky might fallon their heads.”161 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1082935]The Celts, it seems, preserved in their beliefs and legends, along with otherancient peoples, that there had been a time long ago when the sky had done justthat.But beyond Gaul, east of the Rhine, the Roman legions faced an even fiercer foe,indeed, the only foe ever to best the vaunted legions of Rome, the foe thatclosed out forever any Roman conquests in central Europe — in what today wouldbe modern Germany — and that foe was the Teutons, or the Cimbri....the Germans.The classical historian Strabo notes of these tribes that they were even“wilder, taller, and having yellower hair.”162[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1083085] Indeed, whenCaesar’s men at Besancon asked some Gauls, “who were themselves of greatstature” about the Germans, Caesar wrote the following about the Gauls’ reply:> They described the Germans mentioning their enormous physique, their> unbelievable valor, and extraordinary military training. The Gauls said that> often when they had encountered the Germans they had not been able to endure> even the expression on their faces or the glare of their eyes.163> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1083235] Indeed, at the famous Battle of the Teutobergerwald, the Germans would soutterly decimate four Roman armies in the brutal fighting that Rome wouldmaintain a more or less defensive posture with respect to the Germans until theWestern Empire’s final collapse. The Gallic-Celtic giants were one thing, buttheir even taller cousins across the Rhine were quite another.Eventually, however, some of these Germans were captured by the Romans, and oneof them, a particularly troublesome King by the name of Teutobokh, was paradedin Rome in the customary triumph. The Roman historian Floras reports that thisking was so tall that when his captor returned to Rome, “Teutobokh could be‘seen above all the trophies or spoils of the enemies, which were carried uponthe tops of spears.’ This suggests that Teutobokh was easily nine feet tall andperhaps considerably taller.”164[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1083385]"},{"pageContent":"3. GIANT REMAINS AND OTHER TESTIMONIES The story of giants becomes even more intriguing once Europeans established (orperhaps, re-established) contact with the Americas during the great age ofexploration, for many of the early explorers, from Vespucci, Sir Francis Drake,De Soto, to the great Coronado, report their encounters with giants. Pedro deCastaeda, for example, a member of Coronado’s expedition, stated that some ofthe Cocopa Indians were giants “who could carry logs that six of the Spaniardscouldn’t budge.”165 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1083546]Even more fantastically, one of Magellan’s crew reported that when Magellan’sfleet had anchored at Port San Julian “they were greeted by... a native giant”who was so tall “that our heads scarcely came up to his waist, and his voice waslike that of a bull.“166[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1083696] The place seemed averitable haven of giants and remains of giants:> When Sir Francis Drake anchored at the same place in 1578, he didn’t see as> big a giant, but did report that men well over seven feet in height were> there. When Anthony Knyvet visited in 1592, he wrote of men ten to twelve feet> in height.

No one knows for sure, butthere is an interesting suggestion in the literature - both ancient and modern —concerning giants. The Old Testament book of Numbers records that not only wasCanaan, the “promised land,” a land full of giants, but that these giantsinhabited a land “which eateth up the inhabitants thereof,” implying cannibalismwas a favorite practice of giant races.175[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1085547] Even the children’sfairy tale of Jack and the Beanstalk records that the giant of the story is aman-eater.B. SEXEDIGITISM There is yet another unusual feature reported for some giants. The Old Testamentbook of II Samuel (III Kings in the Catholic and Orthodox versions), 21:19-22records that one such Canaanite giant “had on every hand six fingers, and onevery foot six toes.” This is repeated in I Chronicles 20:6. Even more peculiaris the fact that ancient Mayan images of their kings often depict them as havingsix fingers and six toes.176[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1085698]"},{"pageContent":"B. STRANGE LEGENDS AND CHRONOLOGICAL CLUES The picture becomes even more unusual when one considers various legends fromaround the world, legends that associate creation with wars, catastrophes, andwith giants. The Inca legend of its creator god Viracocha, for example, not onlyhas him annihilating previous pre-human worlds, the first by fire and the secondby flood, he then takes two of his servants, who are “sometimes portrayed as asort of Adam and Eve” and then> Went to (lake) Tiahuanaco where he sculpted a great piece of stone, forming an> image of all the nations he intended to create. When he was finished, he> commanded his two servants (to) memorize the names of all the tribes he had> depicted. Viracocha then sent the two servants down different roads to tell> the various tribes to “go forth and multiply and settle the land.” Viracocha> then took another road, doing the same thing. As the god and servants went> down the roads calling, people emerged from the springs, valleys, trees and> other places and then spread through the countryside and formed the nations of> Peru.177 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1085859] Author Stephen Quayle rightly notes that this creation account appears to recordthe destruction by fire of one civilization that occurred before the Genesisaccount, a civilization that obviously would be “pre-Adamic”, and then recordedthe destruction of another civilization by the Flood. There is even another oddparallel, and this is the creation of various tribes by Viracocha and hisservants “calling out” to them, like the Genesis 1 account of God fashioning theworld by a series of spoken fiats.178[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1086020]However, this is not the most unusual thing about Viracocha. For the Incas,Viracocha was also a often described as a giant, with very light skin!179[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1086161]In any case, the references to a creation and destruction prior to the creationof the current heaven, earth, and mankind is a clue, as we shall see, of whenthe scenario of an ancient war and planetary destruction took place: somewherebetween the creation of all and the creation of man.A stranger creation-flood-destruction account occurs in the legends of the NorthAmerican Okanagan Indians.> (In) 1886, historian Hubert Howe Bancroft wrote of the Okanagan myth of their> lost island of origin, Samah-tumi-whoo-lah:> “Long, long ago, when the sun was young and no bigger than a star, there was> an island far off in the middle of the ocean. It was called> Samah-tumi-whoo-lah, meaning “hite Man’s Island.” On it lived a race of giants> — white giants. Their ruler was a tall white woman called Scomalt.... She> could create whatever she wished.> For many years the white giants lived at peace, but at last they quarreled> amongst themselves. Quarreling grew into war. The noise of battle was heard,> and many people were killed. Scomalt was made very, very angry....> (S)he drove the wicked giants to one end of the White Man’s Island. When they> were gathered together in one place, she broke off the piece of land and> pushed it into the sea. For many days the floating island drifted on the> water, tossed by waves and wind. All the people on it died except one man and> one woman...> Seeing that their island was about to sink they built a canoe... after> paddling for many days and nights, they came to some islands. They steered> their way through them and at last reached the mainland.180> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1086302] The parallels here with the Babylonian Enuma Elish and the destruction of Tiamatare amazing.If one understands “island” to mean “planet”, following the suggestion of AlanAlford, and the “sea” as being surrounding space as he also suggests, thenScomalt’s destruction of “White Man’s Island” records the destruction of aplanet. Moreover, the parallel is even more exact in that the apparent “ruler”of both planets is a woman, who becomes angry and causes great destruction. Hereis where Alford’s “metaphor of exploded planet catastrophism” once again breaksdown, for the Okanagan legend clearly has it that the “island” or planet isinhabited by intelligent life, a race of “white giants,” exactly as one wouldexpect if the exploded planet were a large, solid, life-bearing planet, as hasbeen previously conjectured! In other words, the Okanagan Legend records a realwar as the cause of the destruction of a planet, a planet that is life-bearing.But there is more.The Legend also makes it clear that the survivors negotiated their way through“some islands,” braving “waves and wind” after having constructed a “canoe,”until at last they came to the “mainland.” If one extends the “islands” equals“planets” metaphor, more details of the story emerge, for it is clear that the“mainland” differs from the “islands” the survivors negotiate through in size.In other words, these “islands” might very well be the asteroid belt itself, thedebris field of a previously exploded planet — shades of Van Flandern’s revised“multiple exploded planet hypothesis”! Moreover, even the “waves” and “wind” nowtake on a new significance, perhaps explaining why only two of the “whitegiants” survived, for the waves and wind might very well be the sheets of aviolent plasma “electric wind” that permeated the “sea” of local space after thecatastrophe.In short, viewed in this way, the Okanagan Legend is about a war that exploded aplanet, on which dwelt an intelligent race of giants, ruled by a woman, whichrace then constructed an “ark” of sorts to undertake a perilous journey to a newplanet home. The detailed parallels to the Exploded Planet hypothesis and itsmassive water bearing planet, and to the Babylonian war-creation epic, the EnumaElish, are amazing, and in my opinion, not coincidental."},{"pageContent":"C. CURIOUS COINCIDENCES AND CONNECTIONS But if these parallels are not coincidental, what might they imply? Obviously,one answer would be that both the Enuma Elish and the Okanagan Legend, stem fromsome common source far in the mists of “prehistory,” a common “paleoancient VeryHigh Civilization.” If so, then there ought to be similar connections betweenthe classical Old World and the pre-Columbian New World.This is indeed the case, but it presents even more difficulties. For example,there are clear cases of Egyptian remains in North America. As has been seen, insome few cases, the remains of giants found in the Americas are also foundsurrounded by hieroglyphs having similar characteristics to those of Egypt.Former Harvard University professor Barry Fell even believes that the MicmacIndians of Maine and Eastern Canada employed a script of hieroglyphs actuallyderived from Egyptian and Libyan symbols. He believes this because of the highlyanomalous discovery of a tablet on shell mound on Eagle Neck on Long Island, NewYork. The tablet “is now stored at the Museum of the Americas in New York.”181[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1086462]A deeper connection is to be found in human mitochondrial DNA itself. Theconventional theory of the origin of the North and South American native Indianpopulations is, of course, that they migrated long ago over the “land bridge”across the Bering Straits between Asia and North America. In 1994, a team ofEmory University scientists surveyed American Indian groups and theirmitochondrial DNA, and found “four major varieties, each of which had componentsassociated with groups in Asia.” Had the study stopped there it would have beena resounding scientific confirmation of the standard version of “prehistory.”But unfortunately for that version, the study also found a fifth group ofmitochondrial DNA among the Ojibway, the Sioux, Navajo and other tribes, and“the only other place this group shows up is among Europeans.”182[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1086686]The connections become even more amazing, if not perplexing. Consider the factthat the capital of the Aztecs, the magnificent “Venice of the New World,”Tenochtitlan, was situated “on an island in a large lake surrounded by canals.”But why build such a city in such a difficult place, one that requiredextraordinary engineering skills and labor? The answer: The city “was apparentlybuilt as a ‘replica’ of the one” that, in Aztex myths of their origins, “lay tothe East of them and from which their ancestors came.” What makes thisintriguing is “that no such city has ever been found — except in the descriptionPlato gave of Atlantis. ”183[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1086950]While it would be foolhardy to suggest that the Aztecs had read Plato, the“coincidence” points to another “deep connection,” since Plato claims to havederived his famous allegory of the lost planet from Egyptian sources, and theparallels of Egyptian legends with some of those in the New World’s indigenouspopulations has perplexed many scholars of the subject, from alternativeresearchers to those securely ensconced in the towers of academic orthodoxy.But there is one other possibility to be considered, one that, to my knowledge,has not ever been mentioned in connection with the Aztec legends of theirorigins “in the east.” The Aztecs, like the Mayans, were gifted astronomers andmathematicians. Consequently, what if the reference to “eastern origins” is anastronomical one? As I noted in The Giza Death Star Destroyed, if one followsAlan Alford’s prescient suggestion that “eastern” references refer to planetslying outside the Earth’s orbit of the Sun — Mars, Jupiter, Saturn — and“western” references to mean those bodies inside the Earth’s orbit — Venus,Mercury, and the Sun itself — then the Aztec legends of their origins in theeast, in this one instance at least, might be preserving yet another residueshared in common with the classical Old World of antiquity. It might be tellingus that the Aztec’s original ringed city of canals and islands in the middle ofa lake, was on another planet, if it was not the planet itself."},{"pageContent":"D. CONCLUSIONS So what has emerged from this brief excursion into “giantology”? First, bothancient and more modern testimony exists testifying to living giants and totheir remains. If this is loose corroboration of the scenario of a largeexploded planet that was water and life-bearing, then perhaps such creatures ortheir remains as are found on earth are not indigenous to this planet. Theirlarger physiologies would appear to be more appropriate to a planetaryenvironment of larger mass and greater gravity. Over time, as these creaturesgrew accustomed to the earth’s gravity, micro-evolutionary processes may haveled to an adaptation of their physiology to smaller sizes.Secondly, if this were the only corroborating evidence of the scenario, then itwould, as has been noted, be rather loose and unconvincing. But the existence ofa class of legends among many cultures — and I have cited but a very few — thatrefer to a giant race among ancient peoples increases its evidentiary value.Thirdly, the fact that some of these legends, like the Okanagan Indian legend ofSmocalt’s destruction of a planetary “island” with its warring “giants” orViracocha’s two previous destructions of the world by fire and flood — if viewedfrom the paleophysical perspective suggested by Alford where “islands” equal“planets” and “waters” or “seas” or “oceans” represent the surrounding localspace - seem to corroborate the scenario of an ancient and very real war as thecause of the destruction of that planet. The detailed parallels between theOkanagan Legend and the Babylonian War-Creation epic, the Enuma Elish, make sucha scenario more likely.Fourthly, the fact that the Okanagan Legend explicitly refers to a race ofgiants as inhabitants of that exploded, lost world and their subsequent survivaland transplantation to another “island” planetary home, plus the existence ofremains of such giants and reliable classical and modern testimony as to theirexistence would seem to be a piece of evidence that would suggest, contraAlford, that these legends are not metaphors of an “Exploded Planet Cult” or anyother form of naturalistic catastrophism, but the very real, if garbled,accounts of a real war and its aftermath. The parallel with Mesopotamianaccounts is further strengthened by the fact that some other North Americanindigenous Indian legends feature “monsters and giants which both perish by thethunderbolts sent by the Great Spirit.”184[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1087127] This parallels theEnuma Elish and Marduk’s divine arrows and thunderbolts. Contrary to Alford, thegiant remains are obviously not mere metaphors; their existence would thus seemto constitute loose corroboration of the fact that the wars in which thesegiants were repeatedly engaged were not mere metaphors either.It is now time, then, to consider what type of weapon would be involved thatwould allow inhabitants on earth both to see and to record plasma dischargesaccurately.023 [images/00023.jpg] A “Fossilized Irish Giant” Some 12 feet 2 inches tall, leaning against aRailroad Car at Broad Street Goods station, London, in the 19thCentury(Stephen Quayle’s Genesis 6 Giants) French Chart Showing Comparisons of Giants Based on Physical Remains (or in thecase of Goliath, biblical testimony).

McCanney "},{"pageContent":"A. HAMLET’S MILL: ANOTHER MYTHOLOGICAL BACKGROUND"},{"pageContent":"1. THE GALACTIC CONTEXT OF ANCIENT MYTHS One of the most famous and respected scholarly attempts within the mainstream ofacademia to construe ancient myths from a wide variety of cultures — Celtic,Scandinavian, German, Graeco-Roman, Sumerian, Egyptian, Persian, NativeAmerican, and Hindu-Vedic — in a paleophysical sense is the monumental andcritically important work by philosophers Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha vonDechind, Hamlet’s Mill: A Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time. While it would beimpossible to summarize their work adequately here, one salient conclusion abouttheir study should be noted. This is that many of the images and motifs from asupposedly “primitive” time were subsequently wildly misinterpreted because thegalactic astronomical context to which those motifs referred was ignored, if itwas not totally unknown. While any attempt to summarize their work here wouldinevitably fail, some concepts should be highlighted, since they dovetail I havesaid elsewhere188 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1088320]concerning ancient concepts of space and the harmonic interconnectedness ofthings in it.Indeed, De Santillana and Von Dechind noted that one very curious feature ofthis “archaic cosmology” was not only its emphasis on a primeval “cosmicharmony,” but also its description of the creation of the present world as akind of “breaking asunder” of that harmony, “a kind of cosmogonic ‘original sin’whereby the circle of the ecliptic (with the zodiac) was tilted up at an anglewith respect to the equator, and the cycles of change came into being.”189[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1088552] And they hint at thetremendous anomaly at the heart of this cosmology with an astute observation, anobservation many other researchers have pointed out, for such a view requires anastronomical knowledge and “prodigious feats of concentration and computing.”190[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1088752] This implies thatunderlying the relatively “primitive” states of ancient cultures, even ancientcultures as sophisticated as Babylon or China, was something even moresophisticated. Here De Santillana and Von Dechind halt, never speculating onwhat that might be. They are simply concerned with a cataloguing of thecross-cultural motifs, and with an elucidation of their possible meaning inphysical and astronomical terms.One common implication of their cross-cultural comparative mythology approach isthat the ancient cosmology was profoundly aware that “the fabric of the cosmosis not only determined, but overdetermined and in a may that does not permit thesimple location of any of its agents, whether simple magic or astrology, forces,gods, numbers, planetary powers, Platonic Forms, Aristotelian Essences or StoicSubstances. Physical reality here cannot be analytical in the Cartesian sense;it cannot be reduced to concreteness even if misplaced. Being is change, motionand rhythm, the irresistible circle of time, the incidence of the ‘rightmoment,’ as determined by the skies.“191[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1088893] In other words,”there is no simple location, no analytical space.“192[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1089114] While they observethat these ideas ”were incompatible with anything that our physics can thinkof,“193 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1089423] this is notentirely true. While the “on-locality” of any of the active agents in theancient cosmology was something of a puzzle to De Santillana and Von Dechind, infact, with the advent of Quantum Mechanics and Bell’s Non-Locality Theorem, itis not a puzzle at all, but quite the reverse."},{"pageContent":"2. THE ATSRONOMICAL-GALACTIC MEANING OF ”EARTH“, ”THE FLAT EARTH“, AND THE “OURCORNERS OF THE EARTH” Indeed, within ancient myths it would seem that terms such as “Earth” areoperative on a number of discrete but related levels. For example, while “Earth”may indeed refer at the most prosaic level to the planet we are standing on, italso has a meaning in relation to the total system of the galaxy:> In the most general sense, the “earth” was the ideal plane laid through the> ecliptic. The “dry earth,” in a more specific sense, was the ideal plane going> through the celestial equator. The equator thus divided two halves of the> zodiac which ran on the ecliptic, 23 ½ ° inclined to the equator, one half> being “ry land” (the northern band of the zodiac, reaching from the vernal to> the autumnal equinox), the other representing the “waters below” the> equinoctial plane (the southern arc of the zodiac, reaching from the autumnal> equinox, via the winter solstice, to the vernal equinox. The terms “ernal> equinox,” “Winter solstice,” etc are used intentionally because myth deals> with time, periods of time which correspond to angular measures, and not with> tracts in space.194> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1089564] This way of viewing the “earth” is a component in a total system is part of that“open systems paradigm” we first encountered in The Giza Death Star195[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1089737] and is a very modernview, so modern, in fact, that it lies on the cusp of some of the most advancedideas in systems theory.Thus, the “flat earth” is not a reference to some presumed primitive view of theancients who looked at our own planet like a dinner plate or a pancake, but tothe celestial, galactic equator:> The mythical earth is, in fact, a place, but this place is not our “earth” at> all, neither our globe, nor a presupposed homocentrical earth. “Earth” is the> implied plane through the four points of the year, marked by the equinoxes and> solstices, in other words the ecliptic. And this is why the earth is very> frequently said to be quadrangular. The four “corners, ” that is, the zodiacal> constellations rising helically at both the equinoxes and solstices... are the> “points” which determine an “earth.” Every world-age has its own “earth.” It> is for this very reason that “ends of the world” are said to take place. A new> “earth” rises, when another set of zodiacal constellations brought in by the> Precession determines the year points.196> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1089963] There is yet another way to understand the “four corners” of the earth, and thatis as the vertices of a spherically circumscribed and embedded tetrahedron. Notethen that the “four corners of the earth” has essentially two simultaneouslyfunctioning meanings: (1) as a reference to the Platonic solid of an embeddedtetrahedron in a sphere, the “four corners” being its four vertices, and (2) asan astrological-astronomical reference to the constellations rising at thesolstices and equinoxes. It is as if the ancient myths were trying to tell usthat these two meanings might be related in a fundamental physical way that wedo not understand. Perhaps, however, the clue might lie in the other strangecharacteristic of ancient mythological cosmology that De Santillana and VonDechind have already pointed out: the ancients’ view of the active agents oftheir universe — in this case, the globe of the earth, and then the wider“galactic earth” — as being non-local in nature.Another possible clue into an underlying sophisticated — and lost — paleophysicsbehind this non-local view of active agents is afforded by Plato and Aristotle.For the former, in addition to the “four elements” that make up every physicalobject in the world, there is a “fifth” element which, aptly enough, Platocalled the “aether” which “contains the four earthly elements but is whollyremoved from them.”197[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1090153] Similarly, Aristotlechanged this to a kind of ”crystalline heavenly ‘matter.’”198[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1090355] The view is notunique to the Greeks. The Egyptians certainly had their version of this strangetransmutative materia prima, as did the Mesopotamians, the Hindus, theChinese... almost every culture on earth had some version of it. For ourpurposes, it might provide a basis for the non-local character of the activeagents of ancient cosmology. We shall eventually return to this point, but forthe moment, we must note one more strange “galactic context” of an ancientmotif."},{"pageContent":"3. THE GALACTIC MEANING OF “TIAMAT” In this case, the motif is that of “Tiamat,” the Babylonian goddess whorevolted, led a cosmic war with other gods, and was eventually defeated by thegod Marduk.199 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1090496] As Inoted in The Giza Death Star Destroyed, “Tiamat” was not only the name for a“goddess,” but the name for an exploded planet in our own solar system, a waterbearing planet.200 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1090688]Indeed, her name can mean “salt waters” and can imply the “primeval waters,”making her yet another symbol that can operate on a multitude of levels. As Ialso noted in The Giza Death Star Destroyed, her name may actually be a titleconferred on specific individuals or rulers of that now missing planet. She canrefer to the earth’s oceans, as well as another water bearing planet. Andfinally, as “primeval waters” she can also refer to the “deep” or to thetransmutative aether or medium itself. In this last context De Santillana andVon Dechind observe that she can also refer obliquely to the Milky Waygalaxy.201 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1090830]"},{"pageContent":"4. THE CELESTIAL, OR GALACTIC WAR AND DELUGE, AND MARS-NERGAL: THE “GREATLEAPING ONE” One of the overlooked areas of De Santillana’s and Von Dechind’s work is thegalactic and astronomical-astrological context in which they understand theancient mythological references to the Deluge, to war, and other apocalypticimagery. An entry into their discussion is afforded by their remarks on thegigantic war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas in the Hindu epic, theMahabharata: “The epic states unmistakably that this tremendous war was foughtduring the interval between the Dvapara and the Kali Yuga.”202[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1091032] A significant clueis thus afforded from yet another mythological source as to when it dates itsmajor “war of the gods in heaven.”To see why, a brief summary of Hindu thought on its “world ages” or “yugas” isin order. In its most basic form, there are four great “yugas” or ages. Theybegin in a “Golden Age” and each yuga thereafter is an age that is declined fromthe previous one. Each age is thousands of normal years in length, though eachage is of a different length. In order then, these yugas, with their lengths inyears, are:025 [images/00025.jpg] The final yuga, named after the notoriously bloodthirsty deity Kali, is an ageof darkness, chaos, evil deeds, and war. Observe also that each yuga is exactlyhalf the length of the yuga previous to it, until the cycle returns.Note also that in Hindu teaching, the world currently is in a Kali yuga, whichbegan — depending on the authority one consults — approximately 3000 BC. But ifthe Mahabharata refers to events of the previous transition from the Dvapara tothe Kali yugas, running through the full cycle, then one is looking at a warthat occurred between 3,898,000 and 4,320,000 years ago. While many would objectto taking the epic this literally here, it is nonetheless highly intriguing thatthe great war recounted at such length and fought with such eerilymodern-sounding and awesomely destructive weapons in the Mahabharata occurs invery roughly the same time frame as Van Flandern’s second exploded planet event,which occurred ca. 3,200,000 years ago. In other words, we are once againlooking at the possibility of a real war, involving real planets blown up in adeliberate act of that conflict.Let us now turn our attention to a seemingly unlikely source for additionalperspective of this ancient war and the “cosmological original sin,” and theastronomical meaning it entails: the myths of the ancient Germanic peoples ofScandinavia. De Santillana and Von Dechind observe that, like the Hindus, andindeed, like the Babylonians and the Greeks, the ancient Teutons also had aGolden Age, who’s passing was marked by a war between the ruling “good” god andhis ministers and a new race of giants who sought to overturn the old harmoniousorder.> Not having “multiplied” yet, this first generation of the world established> the Golden Age under the rule of Him of many names — Enki,203> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1091181] Yima,204> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1091343] Freyr205> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1091514] and many more.> “But these sons whom he begot himself, great Heaven (megas Ouranos) used to> call Titans (Strainers) in reproach, for he said that they strained and did> presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come> afterwards,” as Hesiod has it (Theogony 207-10).206> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1091672] But what was it that these Titans - or giants or Nephilim or Annunaki orwhatever one wishes to call them - had done? De Santillana’s and Von Dechind’sunderstanding of the galactic context of ancient myths shows exactly what wasinvolved:> ...It was bound to happen ...when future generations would construct> “forbidden ways to the sky,” or build a tower which happened to be too high.> The one secure measure, the “golden rope” of the solar year, is stretched> beyond repair. The equinoctial sun had been gradually pushed out of its Golden> Age “sign,” it had started on the way to new conditions, new configurations.> This is the frightful event, the unexpiable crime that was ascribed to the> Children of Heaven.

In fact, to do so would miss the point entirely, for what theancient myths are trying to say is not only that a planet exploded, but that thewar was truly cosmic in nature, and affected all the celestial bodies of localspace, including “earth.” In the Norse version, interestingly enough, this “endof the world” is brought about by sounding the apocalyptic trumpet, theGjallarhorn, which has a “sound which reaches all the worlds.”208[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1092092] Universal sound,capable of wreaking havoc throughout the “universe”, i.e., all the worlds in thegalaxy.Indeed, as De Santillana and Von Dechind observe, the Graeco-Roman culturalcomplex if full of references to a celestial catastrophe of such magnitude thateven the “immoveable joints of the universe” were shaken and the “very axle”running “through the middle of the revolving heavens” was “bent.”209[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1092241] At the minimum, thislast reference is nothing less than a statement that the angle of the earth’saxis of rotation relative to the ecliptic was altered in some drastic fashion.But what if the reference to a war is taken literally and not metaphorically?Only if one takes it this way do some interesting things now emerge. At thispoint, we shall now begin a process of periodically summarizing the emergingcase, adding, as we go, new details. For now, the details we have assembled arethese:> 1. Van Flandern’s Revised Exploded Planet Hypothesis indicated two events, one> at 65,000,000 years ago, roughly coincident with the extinction of the> dinosaurs, and another “lesser” event at 3,200,000 years ago, roughly> coincident with the appearance of the first humans according to the standard> mainstream theory;> 2. This second event roughly corresponds with the timing given for the Great> War in the Mahabharata;> 3. Both events must have altered the geometry of local space and the> astronomical arrangement of the heavens;> 4. One or both events were observed and recorded, making it likely the second> event was recorded, and referred to as the result of a war,> 5. A case can be made, based on the plasma cosmology of Hannes Alfven and the> petroglyphs observations of Anthony Peratt, that ancient humans observed large> plasma discharges in the heavens, though these petroglyphs cannot be dated to> the time frame of Van Flandern’s second exploded planet event nor to the> Mababbarata’s Great War;> 6. Further basis for believing that such discharges were observed is afforded> by the peculiar resemblance of ancient depictions of the lightning bolts of> the gods, such as Ninurta (with whom we shall much to do in part two), or> ancient Greek depictions of the thunderbolts of Zeus, to the models of plasma> instabilities observed by Peratt in the laboratory.210> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1092382] The fact that> these resemblances are so exactly described in ancient art and drawing, and,> as we shall see in part two, described in texts are being weapons of war,> strengthen the case that we are both looking at observed events and events of> a real war. If so, the it follows that the “broken and shattered geometry” of> local stellar and galactic space described in ancient myths is a result, as> they themselves attest, of a war. In other words, the motif of war in the> myths is not a metaphor for recurrent catastrophism, but the real cause of> catastrophes, just as the myths state.> 7. One or both planets may have been large water-bearing planets, and if of> higher gravity than earth, and if home to intelligent humanoid life, then they> may have been home to a race of “giant” like creatures;> 8. Thus the explosion of such a water bearing planet would give rise not only> to the asteroid belt, but, as the shock wave from that event spread through> local space, would inundate first Mars, and then the Earth, with debris and> water. Thus, the tremendous hemispherical “gouging” by sudden flood waters> often commented upon by Martian planetary geologists is explained. One should> therefore expect to be able to find references of a celestial Deluge.211> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1092751] Of course, there> is no lack of references from various mythological traditions referring to> waters in or above the heavens.

Furthermore, if the exploded planet did have life, and if this life was of> a high degree of sophistication and technological ability, its civilization> might have been interplanetary in nature. The nearest planets capable of> sustaining such life would naturally have been Earth, and Mars. As such, one> might be expected to find mythological associations of Mars with war, which is> in fact the case. In fact, it is highly significant as we shall see that the> Vedic tradition refers to Mars as “the Great Leaping One.”> 10. This war brought an end to an age and was fought between the “gods” and a> race of giants, a theme common to mythological traditions from Sumer, Babylon,> and Greece to Scandinavia and the Celts.> 11. There does exist artifact and textual evidence of giant remains from all> over the globe, which loosely corroborate the existence of anomalously large> intelligent humanoid beings referred to in ancient texts.> 12.

The image of the “divine lightning” or the thunderbolt of the gods will becomequite crucial later on in this chapter."},{"pageContent":"B. TOSSING COMETS AT THE SUN: MCCANNEY’S VERSION As was seen above, De Santillana and Von Dechind referred to the frightful deedof the “Children of Heaven” as having been to “nudge the sun out of place”,which they understood to be a metaphor of the alteration of the angle of theEarth’s rotation relative to the plane of the ecliptic. But might there be anadditional interpretation, one of actually somehow “nudging” the Sun, ofdisturbing it in some fashion that would have dire consequences for the solarsystem?The first to give a hint of this possibility is alternative researcher, andphysicist James M. McCanney. He reproduces the following photograph which camefrom the SOHO satellite, a satellite which “monitors the sun on a dailybasis.”212 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1093138] Toappreciate the significance of the photograph in McCanney’s view, it isnecessary to understand a little about his theory of the electro-dynamic solarsystem, and comets.For McCanney, as for the plasma physicists, the solar system is not electricallyneutral. The Sun, of course, pours out a prodigious amount of electrical andnuclear energy every day. But in McCanney’s view as in the plasma cosmologists’sview, this means that on occasion and under certain conditions, the planetsthemselves can become electrically polarized, and thus, filamentary current canarc between various bodies when the charge is sufficient or when one polarizedbody approaches near enough to another differently polarized body. And thisholds true for comets as for any other body. In short, comets are notelectrically neutral, and their corona or “tail” is a sign of this effect.Now let us consider the 1998 SOHO picture of the Sun. McCanney’s Comets “Shot Across the Bows” from the 1998 SOHO Satellite Picture026 [images/00026.jpg] Note in the upper left hand corner one sees the Sun, and note the large solarflare. The two “comets” are clearly visible, with one very near the solar flare.Now let us cite McCanney in full:> Unexpectedly the two streaking comets came directly into the solar vicinity> and flew directly through the intense solar flare to the lower right of the> sun. The first comet apparently missed by just a small amount whereas the> second made a direct hit through the flare ....> The cover figure has far more meaning than that of just a few comets passing> by the sun. Along with the immense solar which “the experts” said was mere> coincidence, came a buzz out of the high levels of the national and> international security agencies who monitor space for any intruders. The word> from these sources was that this was a “shot over the bow” or also saying> “look what we can do...look how accurately we can aim these puppies”. This is> not me talking, but as I said, this was the buzz out of the security> agencies.213 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1093349] McCanney is implying, in other words, that the comets were artificially andintelligently targeted at the sun, and moreover, that they were polarized insuch a fashion as to cause the solar flare. In other words, the immense flare, aplasma discharge, was not electrically neutral, but of one electrical polarity,and the comet was of another. And this, of course, is implying that someone wasdoing the “shooting”, had the technology to do the shooting, and that it was notus. How else account for the fact that the “comets,” to use McCanney’s aptwording, “unexpectedly” came near the sun?But all this is merely prologue...."},{"pageContent":"C. PULSING THE PULSARS: PHYSICIST PAUL LAVIOLETTE’S PROMETHEAN STAR- ANDGALAXY-SIZED WEAPONS Physicist Paul LaViolette figured prominently in my Giza Death Star trilogy, andrightly so, for he truly is a modern day Prometheus who, as we shall see, is notafraid, in spite of his academic credentials, to think in bold terms, and tooutline the physics of capturing the fire of the stars, and like De Santillanaand Von Dechind, he thinks in terms of the galaxy itself as sources of energyand as means of communication. But as we shall also see, he goes much furtherthan theorizing about communicating literally with, i.e., by means of, thestars, but using them for far deadlier purposes. And La Violette is signallyimportant for yet another reason as we shall see, for his work along with thescalar physics work of Lt Col. (US Army, Ret.) Tom Bearden provides the basisfor solving one of the greatest mythological riddles of them all.LaViolette, it should be noted, has a BA in physics from Johns Hopkins and a PhDfrom Portland State in system theory, and is a member of the AmericanAstronomical Society. Notwithstanding these credentials from mainstreaminstitutions, LaViolette is not afraid to think, and to think deeply, outside ofthe box.But what exactly has LaViolette to do with the stellar and galactic context intowhich De Santillana and Von Dechind place their own paleophysics interpretationof mythological motifs? A great deal.La Violette begins his most recent book, The Talk of the Galaxy, with thehistory of the discovery of pulsars, a kind of star that emits pulses or burstsof radio signals at regular intervals of time. After the first pulsar wasdiscovered in July of 1967 by Cambridge graduate student Jocelyn Bell and herprofessor Anthony Hewish,214[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1093876] its strangecharacteristics began almost immediately to perplex astronomers. After observingthis first pulsar for a few months, its signal suddenly faded, and thenreappeared again. Hewish “became convinced that they had detected a new kind ofastronomical source.”215[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1094066] The regularity ofthe pulses led the team to designate the source “LGM 1, the acronym ‘LGM’standing for ‘Little Green Men.’”216[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1094207] In December of 1967Jocelyn Benn found a second pulsar, designated LGM 2.Obviously, the regularity of the pulses had opened the two astronomers to thepossibility that they were dealing with signals from some intelligence, butsince the two pulsars were separated by 4000 light years, they concludednaturally enough that two civilizations were involved.217[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1094355] Over the next fewmonths as more and more pulsars were discovered, MIT radio astronomer AlanBarrett was quoted in the New York Post as being open to the possibility thatthe pulsars “might be part of a vast interstellar communications network whichwe have stumbled upon.”218[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1094507]But scientists soon moved to close the door on this hypothesis, as onenaturalist hypothesis after another was put forward to explain why pulsarsbehaved as they did. One of the early theories, that pulsars were radiallypulsating white dwarf stars was discarded when it was found that two of thepulsars that had been discovered in the Crab and Vela nebula were actuallyremnants of supernovas, or exploding stars.35 The model that was eventuallydecided upon and which became for a period the standard theory of pulsars is the“Neutron Star Lightouse Model” as LaViolette calls it. Pulsars were thought tobe extremely dense rapidly rotating masses of neutrons, “neutron stars” whichemitted beams of radiation called “synchrotron radiation” as they spun. Thisradiation is not so difficult to understand if one envisions the beam of aspotlight, rotating on its pedestal. When the rotation approaches one’sposition, one sees the beam, until it rotates away, gradually dimming back intodarkness, then gradually reappearing, and so on, only in the case of the pulsar,the beam is a radio wave of several frequencies.This model worked well enough until astronomers discovered pulsars whose pulseswere not regularly spaced, as they would be if the “lighthouse” model were true.The model had to be revised, and revised again, as more and more anomalousbehavior was observed in pulsars. Against this history of failure to adequatelyexplain the pulsar phenomenon on the basis of natural causes and models, then,LaViolette proposes in his book to revive the pulsars-as-nonrandomly placed, andas possible communications devices:> If extraterrestrial civilizations are attempting to communicate with us and> are distinguishing their transmissions by doing “something that can’t be done> in nature,” the pulsar signals certainly are the closest thing known to fit> this criterion.> The chapters that follow present evidence that pulsars are nonrandomly placed> in the sky, with particularly distinctive beacons being situated at key> Galactic locations that are meaningful reference points from the standpoint of> interstellar communication.219> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1094750] Evidence soon showed that pulsars originated from the surfaces of star-sizedbodies, since many pulsars were known to have massive neighbors such as nearbystars or their own orbiting planets.220[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1094935] This fact too,spelled the end of the idea that pulsars might be part of an artificially placedintra-galactic grid.But not so fast, says LaViolette. He urges us do one of Einstein’s thoughtexperiments and> Imagine a scientifically advanced civilization seeking out a hot stellar core> and making use of its outgoing cosmic ray electron wind for communication> purposes. In this case, the star thus functions as a gigantic particle accelerator.Remember McCanney’s comets and the shot across the bow? In this case, theengineering theory at least, is simple:> By using advanced technology... magnetic fields might be artificially> generated near the star’s surface that would, in turn, decelerate the star’s> cosmic ray electrons and cause them to produce one or more beams of> ...radiation.221 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1095084] Note that such a magnetic field might also be engineered to do another thing: itmight be engineered to accelerate the star’s cosmic rays.By placing several such fields near the surface of a star, several such beamscould be directed to different locations. LaViolette reproduces the followingdiagram to illustrate his idea. La Violette’s Model of Using A Star as a Source of Synchrotron Radiation ByEngineering Fields near its Surface222[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1095225]027 [images/00027.jpg] LaViolette then drops his bombshell: “In fact, a careful study reveals thatpuslars are nonrandomly distributed in the plane of the sky in such a way thatthey point out a key location relative to the Galactic Center.”223[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1095411]La Violette then reproduces the following map which plots some 330 known pulsarson a map of the galaxy, with the center being the galactic center:028 [images/00028.jpg] Note that the cluster of pulsars to the left of the galactic center should notbe there if the pulsars were randomly placed. As LaViolette observes the centerof this cluster “marks an angular deviation of precisely one radian from theGalactic center.” 224[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1095576]> What is a radian and why is this particular galactic longitude so special from> the standpoint of extraterrestrial communication? The radian is a universal> concept that comes from the study of geometry. Let us begin by drawing a> circle... If we mark off a length along the circle’s circumference that has> the same length as the circle’s radius, then the angle that subtends this arc,> as measured from the center of the circle, is one radian. It takes a total of> 2π radians to completely circumscribe a circle. Consequently, one radian will> equal 36° divided by 2π, or about 57.296 degrees.225> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1095788] So far so good.But note that the cluster to the left of the galactic center diverges from thegalactic center as observed from Earth. LaViolette then draws the first of manystunning conclusions:> By pointing out (this) one radian (location), the fabricators of this pulsar> network, not only would be conveying to us that their signals are of> intelligent origin... but also that their senders know the director of the> Galactic center as viewed from our solar neighborhood.... Consequently,> marking this one-radian location with a network of beacons would have meaning> only from our particular Galactic locale with its particular perspective for> viewing the Galactic center direction.226> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1095937] But there is a problem with this concept, and LaViolette knows what it is.Any “galactic communications grid” such as he is proposing is constrained by the“relativistic speed limit”: nothing can travel conventionally faster than thevelocity of light. Thus, to construct such an array implies that anyone doing itwould have to have a means both of communicating and traveling faster thanlight.227 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1096116]However, while man has not done the latter (yet), he has already communicatedfaster than light:> In 1991, Thomas Ishii and George Giakos reported that they had transmitted> microwaves at faster than light speeds. Shortly afterward in 1992, Enders and> Nimtz, physicists at the University of Cologne in Germany, described> transmitting microwaves through an undersized waveguide at superluminal> velocity. This work became more widely known after 1995 when this group> succeeded in transmitting Mozart’s 40th symphony through an undersized 11> centimeter long waveguide at a speed 4.7 times faster than that of light.228> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1096269] Other experiments have involved the phenomenon of non-locality, and photonentanglement, to communicate information over great distances229[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1096471] in violation ofrelativistic dogma.But there were other, earlier attempts at communications, and here is where onebegins, at last, to draw close to the connection between pulsars, the ancientwar, and De Santillana’s and Von Dechind’s “galactic context” for ancient myths.La Violette produces the following diagram of a device built by the notedAmerican “electro-gravitics” physicist Thomas Townsend Brown, the physicistwhose name many will recognize as having been involved in the allegedPhiladelphia Experiment.029 [images/00029.jpg] This was Brown’s modification of similar experiments produced by Nikola Tesla,and relied upon the transmission of messages over great distances> By means of longitudinal wave shock fronts. (Brown’s device) generated its> signals by repeatedly charging a capacitor to a high-voltage and abruptly> discharged it through a spark gap. The resulting energy shock fronts so> produced were recived by an electrified capacitor bridge that registered these> waves as voltage transients read by means of a brush chart recorder. An> investigator from the Office of Naval Research who witnessed a test of this> devise in 1952 reported that signals were successfully transmitted to a> receiver located in an adjoining room within an electrically grounded metal> shield. 230 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1096624] In other words, the receiver had been completely electrically shielded, and yetit registered the shock fronts!231[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1096826]Because of this and other phenomena, Brown, like Tesla who had discovered asimilar effect, began to suspect these longitudinal waves were superluminal,“although at the time he had no definitive proof of this.”232[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1097227] But there was more:> Since he had determined that his capacitor bridge was able to detect> gravitational disturbances, he concluded that the signals he was conveying> must be gravitic, rather than electromagnetic. He reasoned that the waves were> the gravitational homologues of light waves, which, for lack of a better word,> he called “quasi-fight.”233> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1097392] Brown discovered that he obtained even better reception if his original titaniumoxide capacitors were replaced by ceramic capacitors with a “high mass densityand high dielectric constant.”234[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1097645] Note that thephenomenon is produced by standard electromagnetic components, the mostimportant of which is a high energy direct current pulse across a spark gap. Inshort, one has similar components in a pulsar, and this leads Laviolette to askthe next important question: “Could the Hertzian electromagnetic emissions frompulsars contain a non-Hertzian superluminal component, as yet unidentified, thatpermits such rapid communication?”235[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1097809] In other words, wasthere a hidden longitudinal wave component in pulsars that was hithertounrecognized? If so, then LaViolette’s thought experiment would be vindicated."},{"pageContent":"1. BACK TO THE MYTHS: SAGITTA, THE CELESTIAL ARROW In order to trace down this and other possibilities for his pulsar hypothesis,LaViolette turns to ancient myths and the zodiac. As he observes,> We cannot help noticing a similarity between the pulsar clump and the ancient> constellation of Sagitta which portrays the Celestial Arrow, both of which> have their far tip situated near the Galaxy’s northern one-radian point. In> the case of the constellatory Arrow, the arrow tip is represented by the star> Gamma Sagittae.... In fact, there is strong evidence to suggest that the> ancient astronomers who outlined the Sagitta constellation knew the location> of the Galactic center and purposely marked this one-radian point.236> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1097994] In other words, the lore of constellations is oddly paralleled by an apparentlynon-random placement of pulsars one radian from the galactic center, as viemedfrom the earth. This implies that whoever “placed” the pulsars, and whoeverinitiated the lore of the zodiac in all its various permeations, may have beenone and the same.In any case, it is worth citing what LaViolette maintains this lore says:> A close study of constellation lore reveals that (Sagitta, the Celestial> Arrow) is part of a larger constellation cipher, one that includes the> southern constellations of Centaurus, and Crucis, as well as the> constellations of the zodiac and their astrological lore. As explained in the> author’s books Beyond the Big Bang and Earth Under Fire these ancient> asterisms and their associated lore use the language of metaphor to convey> that the Galactic center underwent a major explosion and that cosmic rays and> radiation from this outburst began to shower our solar system around 16,000> years ago, bringing about a global climatic disaster....That is, according to> star lore mythology, Saggitarius (The Archer) is aiming his arrow tip (Gamma> Sagittarii) at the Heart of the Scorpion which is specifically represented by> Alpha Scorpii, a bright red supergiant star. 237> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1098147] In other words, we are now dealing not with exploding planets, but an explosionat the center of the galaxy, presumable involving one or several stars!And note now the implications of what LaViolette has almost said: if theplacement of the pulsar cluster to the left of the galactic center by one radianis not non-random, and is moreover only capable of being viewed this way fromthe Earth, and if the lore of constellations emanates from the same source asplaced the pulsars in the first place, then perhaps the deliberate associationof Saggitarius, a chimerical “person”, aiming an arrow or weapon at the galacticcenter is a complex metaphor that the galactic explosion was itself an act in awar, the same cosmic war alluded to in other texts.The implications of LaViolette’s “pulsar hypothesis” are truly staggering, forit would take thousands of years for the energy to travel roughly half wayacross the galaxy from its center to the Earth to impact its climate, since thegalaxy is some 80,000 to 100,000 light years in width! This would require, inother words, any civilization as left these pulsar markers and zodiacal lore tohave been very advanced technologically, and capable of warning its “Earthoutpost” thousands of years ahead of the event!But why associate this event with a real war at all? The answer lies in part ofthat astrological lore that LaViolette does not mention, and to answer it, wemust return, for a moment, to De Santillana and Von Dechind’s Hamlet’s Mill, forthere is also another constellation that is also a “hunter”, a “mighty man ofrenown,” and that constellation is Orion, “alias Nimrod.”238[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1098332] Orion, of course, isassociated with Egypt, and Nimrod was also the first “conqueror” who planned tobuild a “tower” that could “reach heaven,” a tower that had to be destroyed -according to the book of Genesis — because it would allow mankind to do whateverhe imagined to do. This tower that could “reach heaven” was, as I have writtenelsewhere, no mere pile of bricks straining to reach great heights, but rather,a tower incorporating the celestial “plan” or geometry.239[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1098534]But would such a civilization have the technology to cause an explosion of thatmagnitude?Surprisingly, it is LaViolette who provides the disturbing answer. Noting thatthe two nebulae, Crab and Vela, remnants of supernovas or exploding stars, arenot only uniquely placed relative to our solar system, but also two of the fewnebulae that are marked by pulsars, LaViolette cautions that “we must lookbeyond merely the fact that they are uniquely placed relative to us.,,240[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1098776] What one must lookat, rather, is the fact that both nebulae, produced by the explosions of stars,”appear to have been triggered by the same Galactic superwave that wasresponsible for the major cataclysm at the end of the last ice age.“241[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1098961] This wave ”firstpassed the relatively nearby Vela site, causing its supernova to occur, and thenafter traveling some 6300 light years further on, passed the Crab Nebula sitecausing its supernova also to occur.“242[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1099110] As for the mechanismthat could have caused these two colossal explosions,> A particularly intense superwave could have coaxed the progenitor stars of> these various remnants to explode if these stars were hot, inherently> unstable, and embedded in a dust-laden environment. That is, upon their> arrival, the superwave cosmic rays would overpower the star’s stellar wind and> push nearby dust in close to the star. As the star begins to gravitationally> draw this material onto its surface, the added kinetic energy would provoke> its energy output to rise abruptly, whereupon the star would finally explode.> Alternatively, an advancing superwave might carry a steep gravitational field> gradient that could induce frictional tidal forces sufficiently strong to> energize the star and cause it to explode.243> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1099251] But then LaViolette raises a disturbing possibility: the Crab nebulae supernovamight have been purposely engineered “by a highly advanced extraterrestrialcivilization.”244 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1099408] Inother words, if one can engineer a star’s explosion, then one might haveengineered the original galactic explosion as well, even though LaViolette doesnot maintain the latter! Again, in this context, it is important to recall thatfor De Santillana and Von Dechind, the ultimate context ancient myths is agalactic one; Tiamat herself, blown apart by Marduk in the epic of the EnumaElish, may not only have symbolized a planet, but something far, far larger!Something truly cosmic.But again, how might one actually do this? La Violette’s answer is chilling:> The technology required (for interstellar communication) is the same as that> used in particle accelerators employed by high-energy physicists for carrying> out particle collision experiments. It is also the same technology used in> aprticle beam weapons systems such as those developed in the Pentagon’s Star> Wars program. Except in this case the technology would be employed for> peaceful purposes.245> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1099593] Star Wars indeed!But recall that this would still limit one to the “relativistic speed limit” ofthe velocity of light, and this would be far too slow for interstellarcommunications, much less the ability to travel hundreds and thousand of lightyears to place the galactic pulsar “grid.” So a modification is required> Which promises to vastly extend the present state of the art. This so called> beat-wave plasma accelerator is able to generate 10,000 to 10 million times> stronger than those used in the Stanford accelerator. Two powerful laser beams> of slightly differing frequencies are projected into a gas plasma tube to> produce a “beat frequency wave” that moves through the plasma at tremendous> speed. Electrons “surfing” on this wave are then accelerated as the wave> travels down the tube. A 10 meter long accelerator of this sort is> theoretically capable of accelerating electrons to 100 billion electron volt> energies.246 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1099742] Note that what makes this accelerator work is the phenomenon of interferometry,and imagine what might happen if masers (microwave lasers), being squeezedthrough a waveguide that was too small, as was seen earlier, and interfered in aplasma, might then do. For after all, a star is but a big ball of plasma! Andthe “beat wave” is simply the interference wave set up by the interferometry inthe plasma!This is precisely where LaViolette goes:> Could a civilization possessing advanced field projection technologies perhaps> even engineer an entire supernova explosion? By establishing a field bridge> between the two poles of a star and inducing a resonant electrodynamic> oscillation between these two linked regions, the star might be induced to> explode. Clearly, a civilization must reach a high degree of maturity if it is> to wield such a technology.

Take out the primary star, andone takes out the system and any life in it.And this brings us finally to the actual nuts and bolts method that LaVioletteproposes to do it with. The central component, as has been seen, is a “beatwave,” produced by interferometry, in a plasma, such as a star. But how wouldone produce this “interference wave” in a star? After all, one would have to doit from a tremendous distance from the star itself, or risk being consumed inthe stupendous explosion. The answer, not surprisingly, is with microwaveutilization of the principles of optical phase conjugation, which is aprinciple, of course, of scalar physics.> The term “phase conjugation” refers to a special kind of “mirror” that is able> to reverse the trajectories of the incident light waves and cause them to> precisely retrace the path they followd to the phase conjugating mirror. The> outcome is as if the photons had been made to travel backward in time. If you> shine a flashlight beam at an angle toward a regular silvered mirror, the beam> will reflect off at an equal angle in the opposite direction. But if you angle> a flashlight beam at a phase conjugate mirror, the returned beam will instead> shine directly back at your flashlight! Ok, but exactly how does this work?It is extremely important that the reader note the details and conceptualcomponents of LaViolette’s summary of this principle that now follows, for theywill become signally important in answering one of the most enduring questionsof mythology from a paleophysical point of view.> Optical phase conjugation is most commonly known for its use in military laser> weapons systems for destroying enemy missiles. In this application, a laser> beam is directed at a distant moving missile target and light rays scattered> back from the target are allowed to enter the phase conjugator, a chamber> containing a medium having nonlinear optical properties. In this nonlinear> medium, the scattered rays interact with two opposed laser beams of similar> wavelength to form a hologram-like electrostatic light refracting pattern> called a “grating.” Once this grating pattern is formed, the system has> essentially locked onto its target. A powerful laser weapon is then discharged> into this holographic grating pattern, whereupon the coherent laser light> reflects (from the grating) in such a way as to produce an intense outgoing> laser beam that retraces the paths that had been followed by the incoming rays> that had originally been scattered from the missile. Conseguently, the> outgoing laser pulse converges precisely back onto its missile target. 248> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1100111] Bearing in mind that plasma is one such “nonlinear medium,” we may now see whatoptical phase conjugation is, and why it was used in the Star Wars program, boththe modern one, and the ancient one. 249[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1100314]Phase conjugation is best understood by breaking down its components into stepsor stages:> 1. A coherent beam of electromagnetic energy is aimed at a target, which beam> is reflected back to the transmitter.> 2. The returning beam is then split in a non-linear medium and interfered in> it, which creates the “grating”, or, as Lt. Col Tom Bearden would put it, a> “template” for action. The reason that an interference pattern is created is> that the atmosphere distorted the returning or reflected beam, thus making it> of slightly different frequency from the outgoing wave.> And here an important comment is necessary. Vacuum space is also both a wave> propagating and wave distorting medium, for as the rotating version of the> famous Michelson-Morley experiment of French physicist Georges Sagnac> demonstrated, a split beam of light fired in opposite directions in a rotating> system and then interfered produces precisely such a grating or interference> pattern, demonstrating a local effect of an “aether drag.” But what would be> the best way of detecting an interference grating for a target many millions> of miles distant, where electromagnetic waves would have to travel to and back> from an object through vacuum space? Here recall the rotating plasmas, or> plasmoids of chapter two, and one has the answer: the non-linear medium par> excellence for forming a grating that results from reflecting a beam through> the wave-distorting medium of spaces would be a quickly rotating plasma. A> further consequence of this view should also be noted, for this means that> stars are natural phase conjugate mirrors of local stellar- ystem spaces.250> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1100756] Once one has the> concept of phase conjugation and the nonlinear interference grating “capturing> medium” of rotating plasma, one has the two essential ingredients for any such> “scalar” weapon as La Violette proposes.> 3. Once this grid or interference pattern is created, the actual “punch” or> energetic pulse of the weapon is fired through the “holographical” grating> which then reverses the effect of the intervening distorting medium, and thus> the main punch arrives at its target perfectly cohered and in perfect> resonance with its target, since the “grating” is the signature of that target> and that target only. We now return to LaViolette, who proposes a “Mark II” version of phaseconjugation, this time, not with cohered electromagnetic energy in the visiblespectrum, but in the radio and microwave frequencies:> Consequently, it should be possible to phase conjugate microwaves by following> techniques similar to those described in experiments with an optical phase> conjugation. However, it appears that most of this research is still highly> classified. While many papers have been published on optical phase> conjugation, virtually no literature is available on the application of phase> conjugation at microwave frequencies.251> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1101001] And if LaViolette can propose microwave phase conjugation as a kind of Mark II,“power upgrade” of optical phase conjugation, it is not difficult to see thatthe next step, Mark III, would be X-ray and gamma ray phase conjugation.LaViolette produces this simple schematic of his microwave phase conjugatemirror (next page):030 [images/00030.jpg] LaViolette then comments at length as follows:> ...suppose that a bank of high-voltage capacitors are suddenly discharged to> momentarily create a powerful air ionizing arc, or regularly shaped plasmoid.> Also, suppose that a beam of coherent microwave radiation from a maser is> targeted on this plasmoid. This beam would be sent out by a phase conjugating> device something like that pictured... This device splits the original maser> beam into two beams, a probe beam and a pump beam. The probe beam is directed> toward the plasma target, and some of its scattered microwaves shine back> toward the phase conjugator device and enter its mixer chamber. The mixer> chamber is filled with a medium that has very nonlinear electromagnetic> properties. Meanwhile, the pump beam that is split off from the maser> generator is directed to the adjoining mixer chamber where it passes through> the nonlinear mixer medium, reflects from a wall at the far end, makes a> second pass back through the mixer medium, and then reenters the maser> generator compartment.> The microwaves that scatter from the plasmoid and enter the mixer medium> strongly interact with the two pump maser beams to form an electrostatic> grating pattern. This holographic pattern stores information about the> directions and phases of all the scattered maser beam microwaves that have> entered the mixer. The counterpropagating pump beams then reflect from this> grating pattern to produce an outgoing microwave beam that precisely traces> the paths followed by the incoming scattered waves... the randomizing effects> of wave scattering having been automatically compensated for.> ...The grating that performs this time-reversed reflection is called a phase> conjugate mirror and the mixing arrangement that allows all this to happen is> termed a four wave mixer. .....This closed loop path from the maser beam> generator, to the plasmoid, to the mixer, to the plasmoid, and back to the> maser beam generator, causes the maser system to function as a phase conjugate> resonator and to preferentially select and amplify only those microwaves that> target the phase conjuguting mixer chamber. As a result, most of the microwave> power emitted from the maser will end up being confined to a beam that extends> between the maser beam generator, the plasmoid target, and the mixer chamber.> The energy bottled up in this beam will then progressively build up to a very> high value.252 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1101188] One might therefore be able to scale this version of things up considerably, anduse a star itself as the target “plasmoid,” as LaViolette previously suggested.But one might go beyond even the gamma and X-ray “Mark III” versions of thisphase conjugate, star-busting “Mark II mirror.” One might be able to envisionusing those very longitudinal “electro-acoustic” waves themselves in such adevice.In any case, with the “galactic context” of De Santillana, Von Dechind, and LaViolette, it is now clear why the sinking of Atlantis and the wars of the godshave to be understood as involving more than just a lost continent on our tinyplanet. For if LaViolette’s galactic explosion and superwave, or if theexplosions of Van Flandern’s two exploded planets, were acts in a war, an actfought by an extremely advanced society having access to such star and planetbusting phase conjugate mirrors, or “scalar” weapons, and having access therebyto non-local and superluminal means of travel and communication, then Atlantis,and Tiamat were not, per Alford’s reading, merely metaphors of a planetary“mountain” or “island” in the midst of an “ocean” of space, nor, following otherreadings, was the lost continent merely a “continent” or that sank some 10,000years ago beneath the seas here on earth, a distant victim in time and spacefrom that original galactic explosion.But even if this galactic context should not ultimately prove to be a componentof the war scenario, the evidence thus far presented would seem to indicate thatat least one such celestial explosion, even a relatively “small” one of a“small” celestial body, was a gruesome act in a brutal cosmic war.So perhaps the war motif is, on the contrary, true, for as all the physics ofLaViolette and Bearden, and so many others indicates, we are on the cusp ofreconstructing the very technology and weapons that made that war possible. Andif this physics sophistication mirrors an ancient application of similarprinciples, it should not surprise us then that we are also (re-)developingsciences and technologies in other areas, to genetically engineer and alter thebiology of human life itself to prolong it abnormally, the same technologies andsciences which are now allowing us, like the gods of old, once again to dream ofterrible chimeras and hybrids: to grow human ears on rats today, and perhapshalf-human half-animal chimeras, centaurs, and gryphons, and fish-men andserpent-men tomorrow.We have found the physics for the weapons, and seen evidence of their use inphysics theories and ancient petroglyphs, art, and artifacts. We have found thegeneral time periods in which it occurred both in modern theory and ancienttext, and the debris that it left behind, and we intuit, in our inmost being,that planets unlike stars simply do not spontaneously explode. And we havelearned from LaViolette that some stars may not have spontaneously explodedeither. We have seen the gigantic mummies and read the reports of giants,distant cousins, perhaps, of some lost race on a lost and exploded world and -with their great height, their double dentition and sexedigitism - skeletalcontradictions to our sense of the “normal” and regular.But who was fighting?And why?And who won? Who lost?And who were the “good guys” and the “bad guys”? And why were they good? Orconversely, bad, beyond the obvious evil of deliberately blowing up a planet ortwo — or worse, a star - and flooding a couple of others with oceans of waterand debris?We can no longer ask the physicists — or for that matter, the geneticists orbiologists — to lead the way here. At best they can provide us corroboratingevidence or unique insights into the ancient story of this war. But beyondanswering certain specific things one encounters in the ancient texts that tellthis story, these sciences and technologies can show us only that intelligentlife is able to be behind these things and to fight such a war, and that thestory need not be merely metaphors for an accidental cosmic game of billiards inwhich mankind is stuck helplessly on the balls.To ask the questions at all is to turn to the ancients and their texts for theanswers."},{"pageContent":"6.

AsAssyriologist Stephanie Dalley observes:> This account of man’s creation may be compared with that in the Epic of> Creation, in which Marduk used the blood of Qingu, the evil leader of the> enemy gods whom he had slain, to create mankind with the help of Ea; clay is> not mentioned, and no birth-goddess takes part, but the purpose of man’s> creation is again to toil on the gods’ behalf.> ...> The account in Genesis describes God using earth (adamah) to create the first> man (Adam), animating him with the breath of life.266> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1103693] The ancient Mesopotamian account of the creation of man, in other words, appearsgenerally of a piece with the biblical account in so far as common clay or dirtis mingled with the “life” of God or the “gods”: in the case of the Hebrewversion, with the “breath of life,” and in the Atrahasis, the blood of life.But here the resemblance stops. Beyond the obvious moral differences between thetwo accounts, the Mesopotamian version of mankind’s creation also hints atsomething else: mankind is a chimera, a hybrid, engineered by mingling the“gods” with an already existing “man:” “Nintu shall mix clay With his flesh andhis blood. / Then a god and a man / Will be mixed together in clay.” ZechariahSitchin believes that this is an indicator of a sophisticated “paleoscience” ofa very different sort: advanced genetic engineering and manipulation.For the theologically inclined, these observations suggest a method ofreconciliation between the Mesopotamian and the Biblical traditions, for ifthere was an already existing human or human-like creature from which “primeval”worker-man was engineered, as the Atrahasis suggests, then the biblical accountin Genesis would appear to be referring to this creature, while its subsequentmention of the creation of a hybrid race brought about by the intermarriage ofthe Nephilim and the daughters of men in Genesis 6 would then be the hybrid racereferred to here as the creation of man by the gods in the Atrahasis. More onthis point in a subsequent chapter.That this is a plausible reconciliation is borne out by what immediately followsin the Mesopotamian epic:> Far-sighted Enki and wise Mami> Went into the room of fate.> The womb-goddesses were assembled.> He trod the clay in her presence;> She kept reciting an incantation,> For Enki, staying in her presence, made her recite it.> When she had finished her incantation,> She pinched off fourteen pieces (of clay),> (And set) seven pieces on the right,> Seven on the left.> Between them she put down a mud brick.> She made use of (?) a reed, opened it (?) to cut the umbilical cord,> Called up the wise and knowledgeable> Womb-goddesses, seven and seven.> Seven created males,> Seven created females.267> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1103852] In other words, the resulting race of “primeval man”, of “worker man” was ahybrid of the gods and whatever “man” had already existed as the “clay” fromwhich the new man was created. This roughly parallels the account of theNephilim in Genesis 6.But there is another extremely important connection between the two traditionsthat should not be overlooked, and like all such things, it is easy to dobecause it is so obvious. Both the Atrahasis account of the creation of thishybrid “worker” man and the Genesis account of the Nephilim and their hybridoffspring form the immediate context for their respective versions of theDeluge.The Atrahasis legend, however, puts the motivations for the Deluge in starklydifferent terms, for it is not this new hybrid race’s utter lack of moralitythat is the reason for the Deluge, as it is in the biblical account, it israther this new race’s longevity and the resulting overpopulation of the earthby a hybrid “mankind”:> And the country became too wide, the people too numerous.> The country was as noisy as a bellowing bull.> The God grew restless at their racket,> Ellil had to listen to their noise.> He addressed the great gods,> > “The noise of mankind has become too much,> > I am losing sleep over their racket.”> > Ellil orders that the population be reduced by introducing a deadly diseaseamong hybrid population:> “Give the order that suruppu-disease shall break out...”268> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1104033] Dalley’s comment is worth citing:> In Atrahasis the Flood was sent by the gods in order to reduce overpopulation,> a situation which has been compared with an early Greek poem, the Cypria> (loosely attributed to Homer in antiquity and known mainly from allusions and> quotations), in which Zeus planned to reduce overpopulation by war.269> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1104214] In any case, one individual of the new hybrid race, for whom the epic is named,Atrahasis, beseeches his “god” Enki to do something about “humanity’s” plight:> Now there was one Atrahasis> Whose ear was open (to) his god Enki.> ...> Atrahasis made his voice heard> And spoke to his lord,> > “How long (?) [will the gods make us suffer]?> > Will they make us suffer illness forever?”> > Enki’s response to Atrahasis is that he should foment a rebellion against allthe gods, and strike, refusing to work, returning the pantheonic council to thesame situation that led to the creation of the hybrids in the first place:> Enki made his voice heard> And spoke to his servant:> > “Call the elders, the senior men!> > Start [an uprising] in your own house,> > Let the heralds proclaim...> > Let them make a loud noise in the land:> > Do not revere your gods,> > Do not pray to your goddesses...270> > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1104373]> > The result, however, is a replay of what brought about the disease in the firstplace, as Enlil decrees that the hybrid man should be starved to death to reducethe overpopulation:> The God grew restless at their clamour,> Ellil had to listen to their nise.> He addressed the great gods,> > “The noise of mankind has become too much.> > I am losing sleep over their racket.> > Cut off food supplies to the people!> > ....> > Command that Anu and Adad keep the (air) above (earth) locked,> > Sin and Nergal keep the middle earth locked.“271> > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1104554]> > Interestingly, the “god” of wars, rebellions, of Mars and of the Underworld,Nergal, is involved in this nefarious activity.As a result of this new assault, which according to the legend lasted for sixyears, the hybrid “man” was reduced to cannibalism:> A daughter would eye her mother coming in;> A mother would not even open her door to her daughter.> A daughter would watch the scales (at the sale of her) mother,> A mother would watch the scales (at the sale of her) daughter.> When the sixth year arrived> They served up a daughter for a meal,> Served up a son for food.272> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1104739] But even this brutality did not work.Finally a council is held, and Enlil/Ellil complains that the plan to create thehybrid worker race did not work, and he quickly proceeds to blame the god whohas “befriended” mankind, Enki:> He (Ellil) was furious [with the Igigi]273> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1104888]> > “We, the great Anunna, all of us,> > Agreed together on [a plan].> > > Anu and [Adad] were to guard [above],> I was to guard the earth [below].> Where Enki [went],> He274 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1105054] was to undo> the [chain275 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1105310] and> set (us) free],> He was to release [produce for the people].276> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1105540] An argument quickly develops between Ellil/Enlil and Enki:> “[You] imposed your loads on man,> You bestowed noise on mankind,> You slaughtered a god together with his intelligence.> (Ellil to Enki): You must... and [create a flood].> It is indeed your power that shall be used against [your people!]277> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1105721]> You agreed to [the wrong (?)] plan!> Have it reversed!

As will be seen inthe next chapter, this is the same Anzu that wages war with the rest of thePantheon by stealing the Tablets of Destinies, making it likely that the Flood,the decision to wipe out mankind, and the war in the Pantheon, are all somehowcomponents of the same scenario.It is clear from the Atrahasis however, that at least one motivation for theDeluge, as far as the Mesopotamian tradition is concerned, is the overpopulationof the earth by the new hybrid race. Reading between the lines a bit, it ispossible that the pantheon perceived the growing population as a threat to itsown power, a reading borne out by the argument between Enlil and Enki, forperhaps inflicting the catastrophe on the hybrid race was the pantheon’s“loyalty test” on Enki. This would imply that perhaps Enki’s seeming beneficenceto Atrahasis and the human race was just that: seeming beneficence. Perhaps hehad plans to use the revolt among the human workers to further his own power.In any case, it seems that the Atrahasis is more than a mere epic, for it hintsat dark designs and agendas at work in the pantheon, and moreover clearlysuggests that mankind, whether in his hybrid form or not, is perhaps bothbattlefield and prize in a much larger cosmic conflict."},{"pageContent":"2. THE LEGEND OF ERRA/NERGAL AND ISHUM The second major Mesopotamian text that bleakly hints at this central role ofmankind in the conflict is the Legend of Erra and Ishum. Before proceeding tothe text itself, it should be noted that “Erra” is but another name for Nergal,and thus the legend not only gives significant insights into the “mankindmotivation” for the war, but also into the dubious character of Nergal himself,in all his miserific glory.The Legend of Erra and Ishum begins with the creation of the seven “sebitti”,the seven sages-and-warrior gods given to Nergal as his “fierce weapons.” These“seven sages” are critical players in the conflict. Their importance, in fact,is underscored by the Erra and Ishum itself, for they council Nergal into totaland open revolt, and to seek absolute power:> ‘Go out to the battlefield, warrior Erra, make your weapons resound!> Make your noise so loud that those above and below quake,> So that the Igigi hear and glorify your name,> So that the Anunnaki hear and fear your word,> So that the gods hear and submit to your yoke,> So that kings hear and kneel beneath you,> So that countries hear and bring you their tribute,> So that demons hear and avoid (?) you,> So that the powerful hear and bite their lips.’> ...> Warrior Erra listened to them.> The speech which the Sebitti made was as pleasing to him as the> best oil.282 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1106794] One god, Ishum, steps forward to council Nergal against open revolt and war:> When Ishum heard this,> He made his voice heard and spoke to the warrior Erra,> “Lord, Erra, why have you planned evil for the gods?> You have plotted to overthrow countries and to destroy their people, but will> you not turn back?”283> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1106981] Undeterred, Nergal resolves to assault the king of the gods, Marduk himself, andactually confronts Marduk personally.Marduk’s response is to remind Nergal of his power, by reminding him how hedestroyed Tiamat and rearranged the very mechanics of heaven itself:> The king of the gods made his voice heard and spoke,> Addressed his words to Erra, warrior of gods,> > ‘Warrior Erra, concerning that deed which you have said you will do:> > A long time ago, when I was angry and rose up from my dwelling and arranged> > for the flood,> > I rose up from my dwelling, and the control of heaven and earth was undone.> > The very heavens I made to tremble, the positions of the stars of heaven> > changed, and I did not return them to their places.> > Even Erkalla quaked....> > Even the control of heaven and earth was undone...“284> > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1107131]> > At this juncture, it is worth citing at length what I wrote concerning theBabylonian creation epic, the Enuma Elish in my book The Giza Death StarDestroyed.A. REVISITING THE ENUMA ELISH “...The Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma Elish, presents a concise thoughquite suggestive account of this interplanetary rebellion and war. The principalcharacters... are the “gods” Tiamat and Marduk.(1) THE WAR AS A REBELLION “The account begins as a creation account in rather typical fashion for anancient text, recounting a state of initial chaos from which, through conflictof opposites, the order of creation gradually emerges:> 1. When in the height heaven was not named,> 2. and the earth beneath did not yet bear a name,> 3. and the primeval Apsu, who begat them,> 4. and chaos, Tiamat, the mother of them both -> 5. their waters were mingled together,> 6. and no field was formed, no marsh was to be seen;> 7. when of the gods none had been called into being;> 8. and none bore a name, and no destinies [were ordained]...285> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1107329] Note that the first state or condition of creation is an undifferentiated state,or “chaos,” a condition recalling physicist LaViolette’s hermeneutic examined inmy first book, The Giza Death Star.286[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1107623] Thisundifferentiated state would best be described by our modern physics terms of“vacuum”, “zero point energy”, “quantum flux” or even “medium” or “aether.” Theoccurrence of the concept here, prior to the appearance of any distinctiveobjects of creation, is a strong indicator that the document preserves a residueof an earlier more sophisticated “paleophysical” cosmology. This is corroboratedby the absence of names - “and none bore a name, and no destinies [wereordained]” - indicating in another fashion the absence of physically distinctand observable characteristics, corroborating the idea that we are dealing witha document of cosmological physics guised in a religious text.“This might suggest that the proper names for the “gods” would argue against the“titular” pars pro toto rhetorical usage advocated by Laurence Gardner. As willbe seen, however, the association of “Tiamat” with chaos and destructionsubsequently in the Enuma Elish may be an artifact of the role of actual personsin the war described subsequently in the epic. In fact, the indicator of thiswar occurs almost immediately after the opening verses cited above, stronglysuggesting that the conflict was a very ancient one:> 22. But T[iamat and Apsu] were (still) in confusion [...],> 23. They were troubled and [.......]> 24. In disorder(?)..[.......]> 25. Apsu was not diminished in might[....]> 26. and Tiamat roared[.........]> 27. She smote, and their deeds [......]> 28. Their way was evil..[.] .... 287> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1107797] “Notwithstanding the deteriorated condition of the tablets from which the textis translated, there are clear indications that Tiamat and Apsu were realpersons, since they are engaged in activities perceived as evil. Soon afterthis, the epic gives the reason for this moral assessment:> 49. Come, their way is strong, but thou shalt destroy [it];...> > ...> 51. Apsu [hearkened unto] him and his countenance grew bright,> 52. [Since] he (i.e., Mummu) planned evil against the gods his sons.288> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1107968] “Note again the personalism of the document, as well as the fact that the warappears to be a “family quarrel” that has erupted into a civil war, a readingwell in line with Zecharia Sitchin’s reconstructions. Many of the “gods” quicklyflock to Tiamat’s side.“At this juncture, the epic becomes very specific - unusually specific in fact,for a mere “creation epic” - in cataloguing the weapons used by the “Tiamatalliance”:> 109. [They banded themselves together and] at the side of Tiamat [they]> advanced;> 110. [They were furious, they devised mischief without resting] night and> [day].> 111. [They prepared for battle], fuming and raging;> 112. [They joined their forces] and made war,> 113. [Ummu-Hubu}, who formed all things,> 114. [made in addition] weapons invincible, she spawned monster serpents,> 115. [sharp of] tooth, and merciless of fang;> 116. [with poison instead of] blood she filled [their] bodies.> 117. Fierce [monster-vipers] she clothed with terror....> ...> 120. Their bodies reared up and none could withstand [their] attack.289> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1108127]> 121 [She set] up vipers, and dragons, and the (monster) [Lamamu],> 122. [and hurricanes], and raging hounds, and scorpion-men,> 123. and mighty [tempests], and fish-men, and [rams];> 124. [They bore] cruel weapons, without fear of [the fight].290> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1108315] “Now let us pause, and see what has been presented, and speculate on itspossible meaning for the scenario of a“paleoancient” interplanetary war.(2) THE WAR AS INTERPLANETERY > “(a) The war is between the various “gods” as some go into rebellion, for> reasons that the passages cited do not make immediately clear;> “(b) Tiamat appears to fashion two types of dreadful weaponry against her> opponents:> > > ”(1) biological weapons: there are certain features to be noted about these> > weapons if one follows the interpretive paradigm of the existence of> > sophisticated technology in extremely ancient times:> > > > > “(i) some are of apparently much-larger-than normal size and are reptilian> > > in nature, strongly suggesting dinosaurs or similar creatures;> > > > > ”(ii) some are apparently hybrids between species, suggesting the> > > existence of a sophisticated genetics technology, e.g., “fish-men” and> > > “scorpion-men”;> > > > > “(iii) This fact in turn suggests that the hybrid human-animal forms often> > > used in Egyptian hieroglyphics to denote the gods might indicate that a> > > reality once may have been the foundation of the association of such> > > glyphs with the gods in ancient Egypt and other ancient cultures.291> > > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1108490]> > > > > > > “(b) Weather weapons: hurricanes and immense storms.

These are alluded to at the very end ofthe first tablet and again in the second tablet of the Enuma Elish:> 137. She gave to (Kingu) the Tablets of Destiny, on [his] breast she laid> them, (saying):> 138. “Thy command shalt not be without avail, and [the word of thy mouth shall> be establisbed]. ”> 139. Now Kingu, (thus) exalted, having received [the power of Anu]...292> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1109128] “The reference to “the power of Anu” is significant, since “Anu” in theBabylonian theogony is the name of God. Thus, whatever the “Tablets of Destiny”were, they conveyed such tremendous power to their possessor that the power wasregarded as being divine.“If one now combines the insights of Alford and Sitchin, for whom such ancienttexts and names of “gods” were metaphors of naturally occurring planetarycollisions and catastrophes - a metaphor telling of the destruction of the fifthplanet of the solar system by collision with another large celestial body - withSir Laurence Gardner’s understanding of such texts as a “titular” usage of theproper names of the sovereigns of the planets or regions involved, then one isleft with the picture of an actual, though extremely ancient, war ofinterplanetary celestial, or “heavenly” scale, exactly as recounted in otherancient traditions.“But what was the reason for this war? According to the epic, it was Tiamat’spossession of these mysterious “Tablets of Destiny” and the extreme power theyconveyed. This constituted the primary reason for the war against her and forher utter destruction at the hands of her opponents. And this brings us toMarduk, the chief of her opponents in the epic, and to his arsenal and to “TheSequence of Tiamat’s Destruction.”(3) THE SEQUENCE OF TIAMAT’S DESTRUCTION BY MARDUK IN THE ENUMA ELISH (A) MARDUK ’S APPOINTMENT AS SOVEREIGN “The epic quickly moves to the topic of the appointment of Marduk as the leaderof the coalition to defeat Tiamat:> 13. O Marduk, thou art our avenger!> 14. We give thee sovereignty over the whole world.> 15. Sit thou down in might, be exalted in thy command.293> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1109355] “Marduk a little further on is then given a very interesting mission:> 31. Go, and cut off the life of Tiamat,> 32. and let the wind carry her blood into secret places.294> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1109528] “The significance of this mission will be lost unless one bears in mind thetitular pars pro toto paradigm. On that view, Marduk is charged to destroy theentire planet represented by the titular term “Tiamat.” The horrendousbiological and weather weapons Tiamat has unleashed on her opponents has calledforth an escalation of the war as her opponents now call for her completedestruction. This is hinted at by the phrase that her blood - the life of theplanet - is to be carried “into secret places.”(B) MARDUK’S WEAPONRY: THE “STEALTH SUIT” AND INVISIBLE WEAPON “In this same context, Marduk is then given two rather interesting weapons, fromthis “paleophysical” point of view, one of which, perhaps, represents some formof stealth technology:> 23. “Command now and let the garment vanish,> 24. and speak the word again and let the garment reappear!”> 25. Then he spake with his mouth, and the garment vanished;> 26. Again he commanded it, and the garment reappeared.295> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1109687] “In addition to this “stealth suit,” Marduk is given an invincible weapon, aweapon far exceeding Tiamat’s biological and weather arsenal:> 27. When the gods, his fathers, beheld (the fulfillment of) his word,> 28. they rejoiced, and they did homage (unto him, saying) “Marduk is King!”> 29. They bestowed upon him the sceptre, and the throne, and the ring,> 30. They give him an invincible weapon, which overwbelmeth the foe.296> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1109859] “What this invincible weapon may be is not described nor named, but its effectsappear to be in view in the following passage:> 39. He set the lightning in front of him,> 40. with burning flame he filled his body,> 41. he made a net to enclose the inward parts of Tiamat,> 42. the four winds he stationed so that nothing of her might escape,-...> 43. The South wind and the North wind and the East wind and the West wind> 44. He brought near to the net, the gift of his father Anu.> 45. he created the evil wind, and the tempest, and the hurricane,> 46. and the fourfold wind, and the sevenfold wind, and the whirlwind, and the> wind which hath no equal.297> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1110034] “This passage implies a rather remarkable set of characteristics of the“invincible weapon”:> “(a) Its use apparently involved lightning, i.e., extremes of electrostatic> energy;> “(b) The “net ” used to “enclose the inward parts of Tiamat” recalls the> language of another Babylonian epic, the Lugal-e, which forms so much of the> material Zechariah Sitchin used to reconstruct his “Second Pyramid War.”298> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1110209] As was detailed in> my first book, The Giza Death Star, the term “net” in the Lugal-e occurred in> a context such as to suggest a weapon employing gravity and acoustics as its> primary component. Thus, the “inward parts of Tiamat” strongly suggests an> interpretation, not of planetary “external” collisions, but something> “internal,” affecting the planetary core of Tiamat. Thus, Marduk’s “invincible> weapon” appears to be able to tap into the field of space-time, i.e., the> medium itself, and thereby the planetary center of Tiamat. While this> interpretation is at this juncture highly speculative, it is corroborated in> quite strong language at the end of the fourth tablet as we shall see.> “(c) If one understands the “net” in this fashion, as the gridwork or lattice> or cellular-like structure of the medium itself, then further corroboration of> this reading would appear to be provided by the reference to the “four winds,”> which might be taken to mean the compass points, or even more abstractly,> coordinate references. In this regard, it will be recalled that the ancient> Hindu epics, examined in The Giza Death Star,299> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1110507] made similar> reference to a weapon that was tied to the four points of the compass.> “(1) Alternatively, such references to the “four winds” or “the four compass> points” or, as is very common, the “four corners of the earth” might also be> taken as indicating something even more profound. It will be recalled from The> Giza Death Star Deployed that the simplest geometric solid that can be> circumscribed in a sphere is a tetrahedron, a four-sided pyramid with four> vertices touching the surface of a sphere.> 031 [images/00031.jpg]> > “(d) Finally, the passage refers to weather weapons that are specifically> rotational or vorticular in nature: “hurricanes” and “whirlwinds”.

If this is> true, them this is a very significant clue as to the fundamental unifying> concept of paleophysics. It is, perhaps, the single most important clue, for> it points clearly to vortex physics. “With these thoughts in mind, we turn to the Sequence of Tiamat’s Destructionitself. This “Sequence” comprises the main theme of the Fourth Tablet of theEnuma Elish. In it, as we shall see, the signature of Marduk’s “invincibleweapon” points very strongly to it being the type of “scalar” weapon employingsuch distortions or pressure waves in the medium as its primary component,exactly what I have argued in The Giza Death Star and The Giza Death StarDeployed:> 47. He sent forth the winds which he had created, the seven of them;> 48. to disturb the inward parts of Tiamat, they followed after him.> 49.

Let us note the sequence:> “(a) The “winds” are sent to “disturb” or destabilize the “inward parts” of> Tiamat, the planetary core(w. 47-48);> “(b) “Lightning” is then unleashed on the already unstabilized planet from the> “four winds”, i.e., from every direction(w. 49-50), or alternatively, at the> tetrahedral “vertices”;> “(c) These “thunderbolts” are then apparently directed toward that> destabilized core, suggesting that a sudden and extreme pulse is> administered(vv. 58, 65, 75-78);> “(d) Tiamat responds with cries and trembles and shakes to “her very> foundations”, i.e., experiences very severe earthquakes or acoustic> cavitations throughout the planet, to its very core(w. 95, 97-97);> “(e) Tiamat appears unable to break resonance with the weapon (w. 97-98) as> Marduk spreads the net and drives in the final “wind” or pulse(v. 98);> “(f) Tiamat reaches maximum instability in her planetary core and mantle (w.> 98-99);> “(g) Marduk pierces the crust, and releases the enormous energies that have> built up in the planet through the acoustic cavitations, resulting in a> colossal explosion with the entire planet as its fuel, rather like bursting a> balloon filled to extreme pressure.(w. 101-102, 137). “All this implies the existence of a physics sophisticated enough to “measurethe structure of the deep”(v. 143), and to weaponize it.307[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1111854] This last statementis the reason why it was argued that the reference to “winds” in the case ofMarduk’s weapon may indicate the types of longitudinal pressure-waves associatedwith Tesla-like scalar weapons.“Another comment is perhaps warranted by this discussion. It is to be noted thatMarduk “measures the structure of the Deep” after Tiamat’s destruction. Thiswould have been necessary in terms of the type of physics being suggested, sincethe destruction of a planetary sized body in the approximate orbit of theasteroid belt would have required an adjustment to astronomical measurements ofthe solar system, since its previously existing celestial mechanics and geometryhas been shattered.308[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1112089] With the explosionof a planet giving rise to the cyclic return of comets and the “catastrophes”they bring, one has an explanation for catastrophism itself. The war andcatastrophism are therefore intimately related, for on this view, the planetarywars of the “gods” is not a metaphor for the latter, but its very real originand cause.“A final comment is necessary about the Enuma Elish. The preceding excerptswould seem to contraindicate its being a creation account at all. Rather, itwould seem that it is more an epic of “War Among the Gods”.309[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1112645] That it came to beinterpreted as a creation epic involving dualism and dialectics of opposites isperhaps due to the quick change from creation in the opening verses to itspreoccupation with war for much of the remaining epic. In this sense, it is aninterpretation that the legacy civilization - Sumer and Babylon - most likelyplaced upon it.310 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1113548]But read from the paleophysics standpoint of interpretation being argued hereand in my two previous books The Giza Death Star and Giza Death Star Deployed,it is first and foremost the account of a very ancient, very real, and quiteinterplanetary war within our own solar system, in a galaxy long, long, ago, andfar, far away.”311 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1113816] Marduk’s remarks in the Erra and Ishum are wholly in line with the outlines ofthe scalar physics found in the Enuma Elish cited above, referring, for example,to making the very heavens tremble, changing the positions of the stars, i.e.,the planets of the solar system, even undoing the control of heaven and earth, aclear allusion to the broken celestial mechanics of the solar system after theexplosion of Tiamat-Kyrpton (Krypton being another name for Tiamat, I believe).And we can fix a date to this event, on the basis of Van Flandern’s revisedMultiple Exploded Planet Hypothesis: 65,000,000 years ago. Marduk’s warning toNergal in the Erra and Ishum is therefore perhaps obliquely referring to VanFlandern’s second event at 3,200,000 years ago, for it would seem to besuggested by the Erra and Ishum that Nergal is plotting a similar destruction.As we shall see later on in this chapter, there is other textual corroborationfrom Mesopotamia of Van Flandern’s two explosions at these two separate dates.Returning to the Erra and Ishum, Marduk reveals to Nergal that he actuallyconsidered wiping out the survivors of his destruction of Tiamat and theresulting floods it caused elsewhere:> (As for) the people who were left from the Flood and saw the result of my> action,> Should I raise my weapons and destroy the remnant?312> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1114018] This is an important statement, for it implies once again that there wereobservers of the destruction of Tiamat, of the awesome weapons deployed, and ofthe celestial displays that resulted. Shades of Anthony Peratt!Then follows an astonishing challenge from Marduk:> I changed the location of the mesu-tree (and of) the elmesu-stone, and did not> reveal it to anyone.> Now, concerning that deed which you have said you will do, Warrior Erra,> Where is the mesu-wood, the flesh of the gods, the proper insignia of the King> of the World...?> ....> Where is the pure zaginduru-stone which [ ]threw away?“313> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1114200] In the next chapter we shall examine the technological motivation for the war,the theft by Anzu of the Tablet of Destinies from Enlil. These, as we shall seethere, are objects of technology that conveyed supreme power to theirpossessors. Here, Marduk appears to be referring to some similar objects,without which he hints that Nergal’s plan is doomed to failure.Nergal then addresses Marduk at length, and though the text is decayed at thispoint, perhaps one may speculate that he is challenging him to produce thelocations of various stones and objects of power,314[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1114382] or perhaps, failingto learn their location, proceeds to persuade Marduk to join him in his courseof action. This, it would seem from what follows, is a likely conjecture:> When Marduk heard this,> He made his voice heard and spoke to warrior Erra,> > “I shall rise up from my dwelling, and the control of heaven and earth will> > be undone.> > The waters will rise and go over the land,> > Bright day will turn into darkness.> > A storm will rise up and cover the stars of heaven.> > An evil wind will blow, and the vision of people and living things will [be> > obscured (?)].315> > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1114568]> > Marduk, in other words, appears ready to join Nergal’s war and to inflict asecond cosmic catastrophe. If this would seem to be stretching the text, it isplaced beyond doubt by Nergal’s speech which immediately follows, and Marduk’sreaction to it:> When Erra heard this,> He made his voice heard and spoke to prince Marduk,> > “Prince Marduk, until you re-enter that house...> > Until then shall I rule and keep firm control of heaven and earth.> > I shall go up into heaven, and give orders to the Igigi;> > I shall go down to the Absu and direct the Anunnaki> > ...> > I shall set my fierce weapons over them.> > At that house which you shall enter, prince Marduk,> > I shall make Anu and Ellil like down like bulls, to right and left of your> > gate.“> > > Prince Marduk listened to him,> And the speech that Erra made was pleasing to him.316> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1114875] Later on, after his success, Nergal is praised by Ishum in terms that imply hiscontrol over the very same scalar technology that Marduk used to destroy Tiamat:> Ishum made his voice heard and spoke to warrior Erra,> > ‘Warrior Erra, you hold the nose-rope of heaven,> > You control the whole earth, and you rule the land.“317> > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1115057]> > Then follows a rather curious statement, one highly significant given what hasalready been said about the Nephilim and the use of hybrid species as workersand weapons; Ishum is speaking to Nergal:> “You have changed your divine nature and become like a human!”318> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1115207] This vaguely suggests that Nergal was also intimately involved in the hybridcreation projects.No examination of the Erra and Ishum legend would be complete, however, withoutciting the lengthy speeches where Ishum describes Nergal’s genocidal andmonomaniacal character:> “You set up the weapons of kidinnu-men as an abomination to Anu and Dagan.> You have made their blood flow like water in the drains of public squares.319> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1115348]> > > > > > O warrior Erra, you have put the just to death,> You have put the unjust to death.> You have put to death the man who sinned against you,> You have put to death the man who did not sin against you.> ...> You have put old men to death on the porch,> You have put young girls to death in their bedrooms.> Yet you will not rest at all.320> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1115498]> > > Warrior Erra listened to him,> And the words that Ishum spoke to him were as pleasing as the best oil.> And Warrior Erra spoke thus,> > “Sea (people) shall not spare sea (people), nor Subarian (spare) Subarian,> > nor Assyrian Assyrian,> > Nor shall Elamite spare Elamite, nor Kassite Kassite,> > Nor Sutean spare Sutean, nor Gutian Gutian> > ...> > Nor shall tribe spare tribe, nor man man, nor brother brother brother, and> > they shall slay one another.”321> > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1115680]> > What emerges from this legend is the picture of a supreme warlord, basking inhis sick bloodlust and supreme powers of destruction, affording yet anotherglance in the ongoing struggle in the pantheon for supreme power."},{"pageContent":"3.

THE EGYPTIAN VERSION Corroboration of the Mesopotamian legends comes from one of the most obscuretexts of ancient Egypt, the so-called Edfu temple texts. So obscure is this textthat it has never been completely translated, and perhaps for good reason, forits contents would certainly be of extreme interest to anyone wishing toreconstruct not only a “paleoscience” but also the events of that paleoancientpantheonic war. So obscure are the Edfu texts that the best source for theirstudy remains a secondary source which quotes extensively from them. This isE.A.E. Reymond’s The Mythical Origin of the Egyptian Temple, published by theUniversity of Manchester in England in 1969. Another important source isrevisionist author Andrew Collins’s Gods of Eden: Egypt’s Lost Legacy and theGenesis of Civilisation. The latter book is relied on here primarily due to therelative ease with which it is publicly available, although Reymond’s work willalso be extensively cited for certain details.The Edfu texts are found inscribed on the walls of the temple of Edfu. Collinsnotes that what remains of this temple was “begun in 237 BC, and yet it was notcompleted until 57 BC.”322[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1115830] Since each templehad its own “building text” that summarized “the name, nature, ritualsignificance and sometimes even the contents of decoration of the particularroom,”323 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1116010] then it is“possible to draw up an outline picture of the nature and significance of templeas a whole” by conflating these texts.324[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1116219] Like many otherEgyptian texts, however, the Edfu texts clearly stated that they were based onextremely ancient antecedents, for “according to legends carved” on the stonewalls of the temple, the current structure was a replacement for a much oldertemple> designed in accordance with a divine plan that “dropped down from heaven to> earth near the city of Memphis. Its grand architects were, significantly,> Imhotep - a native of Memphis and, of course, a high priest of Heliopolis -> and his father Kanefer.325> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1116360] The Edfu texts, in other words, claimed a very ancient provenance.But the “jewel in Edfu’s crown” are its “so-called Building texts which adornwhole walls in various sections of the existing Ptolemaic temple.”326[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1116533] It is here thatE.A.E. Reymond’s work enters the picture, for as Andrew Collins observes, “shewas one of the few people who seemed to have grasped the profound nature of theEdfu texts and realized that they contained accounts of a strange world thatexisted in Egypt during what might be described as the primeval age.”327[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1116683] While “the texts atEdfu are many and varied,” Collins observes that it is almost a certainty> that much of their contents was derived from several now lost works, with> titles such as the Specification of the Mounds of the Early Primeval Age,> accredited to the god Thoth, the Sacred Book of the Early Primeval Age of the> Gods and one called Offering the Lotus. All of these extremely ancient works> begin with the gradual emergence out of the Nun, the primeval waters, of a> sacred island, synonymous with the primeval mound of Heliopolitan tradition.> This event is said to have occurred during a time-frame spoken of by Reymond> as the “first occasion” - her interpretation of the Egyptian expression sep> tepi, or the First Time.328> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1116841] As I noted in the first book of my Giza Death Star Trilogy, The Giza Death Star,physicist Paul LaViolette understands this primeval mound to refer to the apaleoancient and highly developed science of a transmutative aether or medium ofcreation. The “mound” being the first emergence from that sea of nothingness,the Nun or primeval waters, of a particle wave form.329[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1116982]Around this primeval mound, which was known as “the Island of the Egg” was a“channel of water,” and on the edge of it was “a field of reeds” thatconstituted a kind of sacred domain where columns “referred to as djed-pillars”were erected for the domain’s “first divine inhabitants.”330[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1117160] These were led by agroup of “Sages” who were in turn led by “an enigmatic figure called... simplyThis One.”331 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1117333] TheseSages of “faceless forms were said to have been the seed of their own creationat the time when the rest of the world had not yet come into being.”332[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1117474] Indeed, these Sagesare said by the Edfu texts to have preceded the appearance of the standardEgyptian gods.333 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1117815]This tranquil state of affairs does not continue for long, however, for> The Edfu account ... alludes to some kind of violent conflict which brought to> a close the first period of creation. An enemy appears in the form of a> serpent known as the Great Leaping One. It opposes the sacred domain’s divine> inhabitants, who fight back with a weapon known only as the Sound Eye, which> emerges from the island and creates further destruction on behalf of its> protectors. No explanation of this curious symbol is given, although Reymond> felt it to be the centre of the light that illumines the island. As a> consequence of this mass devastation, the first inhabitants all die.... Death> and decay are everywhere - a fact recorded in the alternative names now given> to the Island of the Egg, which include the Island of Combat, the Island of> Trampling, and, finally, the Island of Peace.334> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1117965] These statements positively compel and require commentary.Firstly, it is to be noted that sometime after their “self-creation” from the“primeval waters,” an expression of speech that I believe refers to LaViolette’s underlying transmutative medium, a cosmic and cosmically violentconflict, a war, erupts. Moreover, the similarity here to Tiamat, whose namelikewise symbolizes not only a planet, but primeval waters in the BabylonianEnuma Elish, is not to be overlooked. In other words, the Edfu text may beobliquely referring to the destruction of Tiamat-Krypton, Van Flandern’s firstexploded planetary event, that took place ca. 65,000,000 years ago. But there isanother possible parallel to be noted, and this is the similarity of the Edfuaccount of a primordial war or conflict that occurs almost immediately after thefounding of the “island” or first creation, to that of the Fall of Lucifer inthe Judeo-Christian tradition. More will be said on this subject in a laterchapter, but it is important to draw attention to it here.Secondly, the individual that appears to have wrought this destruction isreferred to as “the Great Leaping One,” a title we have encountered before as aVedic reference. This title seems to beg for association with the priests ofSali in ancient Rome, who celebrated the feasts associated with Mars and thefounding of Rome by leaping in the streets and blowing trumpets.335[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1118123] In other words, theEdfu texts are obliquely indicating that this ancient war, the end of the periodof the “First Creation,” somehow involved Mars. There are numerous connectionsto Mars to be considered, and it is best to do so now."},{"pageContent":"1. EDFU AND THE MARS CONNECTIONS As mentioned above, when the primeval “island” or “mound” emerged, it “seems tohave been in darkness, surrounded by the primeval water.”336[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1118311] Before continuing, aconnection to the Babylonian epic, the Enuma Elish should be noted, for thedestruction of the planet Tiamat by Marduk may also be interpreted as thedestruction of the primeval waters, since the name “Tiamat” signifies preciselythose waters. Thus, the Edfu accounts, by referring to a similar primordialconflict that results in the destruction of the first “mound” is describing asimilar, if not the very same, event. But in any case, once this primordialmound is brought forth, the Edfu texts relate that it was attended upon by twodeities, named Wa and Aa.337[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1118521] And here anotherconnection to Mesopotamia may be in evidence, for as is well known, another namefor the Sumerian god Enki is Ea, who is of course Enlil’s opposite number. Thissuggests that perhaps the god Wa is but the Edfu texts’ name for Enlil.It is in this primordial conflict that we encounter numerous threads ofconnection to Mars. For example, Reymond points out that the Edfu texts also area catalogue of the “origin of the sacred places of the Falcon and those of theSun-God.”338 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1118662] Themention of the Falcon recalls one name for Horus in the Egyptian symbolism ofthe gods, and that is his title “Falcon of the Horizon.” This title is aconnection to Mars as will eventually be seen. The sun-god referred to here is,of course, Ra. Thus in the Edfu texts, there is implied a clear set ofrelationships between Edfu, Horus and thereby Mars, and Ra.A further connection to Mars is to be observed in a title given in the Edfutexts to the “island” after the conflict, and that is “the underworld of thesoul.” In this respect, one should recall that the connection between Mars andthe underworld is very clear in the Mesopotamian tradition, with Nergal, the godof Mars who is also the god of the underworld. As Reymond also observes, it isshortly after this initial primordial conflict that the appearance of the“serpent” first occurs.339[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1118811] This fight againstthe snake was led by none other than the Falcon.340[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1119013] However, the Edfutexts give Horus himself his own peculiar association with serpents. Accordingto Reymond, Horus “is equated with Tanen, and is described as the ‘snake whocreated the Primeval Ones...”341[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1119216] But what of thefirst serpent, against whom this struggle is waged? Reymond observes that thisserpent has a most unusual, and for our purposes here, significant title; he isknown as “The Great Leaping One.”342[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1119365] This is a verystrong connection to Mars, for as I noted in my book The Giza Death StarDestroyed, the ancient Roman festival for Mars, whose priests were known as the“leaping priests,” because of their practice of jumping and leaping during theMars festival.343 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1119515] Inthe Vedic tradition the title of “The Leaping One” is precisely a designationfor Mars.Consequently, the Edfu texts convey, in the following variety of ways, aconnection between the primordial “war,” the “island,” and Mars:> 1. In the connection between Horus, the “Falcon of the Horizon”, and Mars;> 2. In the title “the Great Leaping One” and its connection to Mars;> 3. In the fact that the “island” is surrounded by primordial waters, which> closely parallels the designation of Tiamat in the Mesopotamian tradition, in> this case, Tiamat’s orbit would “surround” the “island” of Mars. But it is even more illuminating to note what the Edfu texts have to say aboutthe weapons used in this ancient conflict. The inhabitants of the sacred “Islandof the Egg” fight back with a weapon called the “Sound Eye,” a weapon which theEdfu texts state emerges from the island in the very same waters, i.e., from thevery same transmutative medium. This strongly suggests that the “sound” involvedwas longitudinal pressure waves or stresses in the medium itself. In short, the“Sound Eye” may be a crude metaphor for these very type of “electro-acoustic”longitudinal waves and stresses in the medium, the “Sound” part of the “SoundEye” referring to the “acoustic” part of “electro-acoustic,” and the “Eye” partreferring to the “electromagnetic” part. “Sound Eye” is thus a crude, butsynonymous way of saying “electro-acoustic.” Thus, while Collins observes thatReymond provides no explanation for this curious weapon,344[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1119704] an explanation isreadily available if one interprets it as a metaphor for the type of scalar“paleophysics” I advanced in my three Giza Death Star books. This “sound eye”parallels traditions noted in Ovid of a race of giants called Telchines whoblighted the land by a glance from an “evil eye.”345[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1119913] A clue to the powerof this weapon may be seen by comparing it to another part of the Edfu textsdealing with the creation itself.Reymond notes that the act of creation is a “symbolic and magical rite” whosemain part> Consisted of uttering sacred spells by the creators over certain (objects)> which, we may say, might have been believed to symbolize the Earth to be> created. We suspect that by virtue of this rite it was believed that the> symbols of the Earth were filled with special power. Thus far, these objects and the associated “spells” sound very much like theSumerian Tablets of Destinies, a similarity that will assume great importance inchapter ten.> This process of creation of the Earth by the word of the creators has no> equivalent. Such a manner of creation can be compared with the Hermopolitan> conception of the creation of the world; according to the latter, the Earth> was believed to have been created by drying up the primeval waters that> surrounded the island. Both of these ways of creating, the magical process as> well as the procedure by solar radiance, had the same result, they seem to> have made manifest what was created previously by the nameless powers, but was> hidden beneath the primeval waters.346> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1120099] Note what Reymond has really implied here:> 1. The Edfu accounts, by maintaining a creation by the utterance of “magic> spells” is paralleling yet another famous account of a similar concept of> creation, that of Genesis 1. Both maintain that sound is somehow involved;> 2. These “spells” were, however, unlike the Genesis account, uttered over> certain objects which then created the various “earths” desired;> 3. If one adds in the Hermopolitan tradition, the use of (solar) radiation or> energy is also a component. Boiling this down, we have:> 1. Sound> 2. Objects> 3. Energy, or radiation. If this begins to sound eerily similar to the scalar physics discussed inchapter two, it should, for a scalar wave is nothing less than a pressure waveor stress in the medium of space time itself, a stress in turn caused by theinterferometry of electromagnetic radiation. Viewed in the paleophysical sense,then, the Edfu texts are describing a process of creation by the paradigmsscalar physics, a process that possesses “all the power of the universe.”Note then Andrew Collins’ extremely intriguing comment that the use of this“Sound Eye” by the Island of the Egg’s inhabitants to defend themselves resultsin their utter destruction. This too may be seen in the light of the ExplodedPlanet Event at 65,000,000 years ago, for the explosion of such a large planet,especially if it was water-bearing, would have likely nearly obliterated anylife on Earth. The “smaller” event of some 3.2 million years ago, while causingsevere collateral damage in its immediate celestial vicinity, would not havebeen as drastic.But with this observation, one must raise an objection: there is nothing in theEdfu texts thus far to suggest that this primeval “Island of the Egg” was onEarth at all. Moreover, my own suggestion that it is a metaphor for thepaleophysics of a transmutative aether and the emergence of particles from the“sea of quantum fluctuations” would also seem to preclude this idea. We shallreturn to this point in a moment.Collins remarks that “after this violent conflict with the enemy serpent, amajor transition occurs in the conception of the sacred island. For a time itvanishes beneath the primeval waters of Nun....then it emerges again andhenceforth is given the title Underworld of the Soul. It also becomes known asthe Place of the First Occasion... ”347[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1120306]The history of this sacred Island is as equally interesting after the war asbefore it. The Edfu texts state that a second and new group of divineinhabitants comes to dwell on the Island, whose leaders are Wa and Aa,348[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1120479] the latter of whichmay be identical to the Mesopotamian Ea. The leaders of this new group ofoccupants are given “enigmatic titles such as ‘The Far Distant’, ‘The Sailor’”and a title suggestive of their bloodthirsty and/or cannibalistic nature, “TheLord, mighty-chested, who made slaughter, the Soul who lives on blood.”’349[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1120629]Note the sequence that we now have:> 1. Sages “create themselves” from the “primeval waters,” a metaphor, perhaps,> for a paleophysics of a transmutative aether or medium. These sages then> occupy an “island” in the midst of water.> 2. A “Great Leaping One,” a serpent, goes to war with the divine inhabitants> of the Island, who defend themselves with the “Sound Eye” and destroy> themselves in the process.> 3. The Island recedes back into the primeval waters, and again reemerges with> new occupants, who appear to be of a different, warlike and bloodthirsty> character, than its first inhabitants. These observations suggest that ownership or dominion of the island changedhands, a point whose full significance will be appreciated in a moment.Then,> After an undisclosed period, rising waters again threaten the Island of> Trampling, causing the original temple ... to be damaged or destroyed. Yet> then something curious occurs.... Wa and Aa are instructed by the> God-of-the-Temple to enter within the enigmatically named> Place-in-which-the-things-of-the-earth-were-filled-with-power, another name> for the water-encircled island, and here they conduct “magic spells” which> make the waters recede. To this end they appear to have used mysterious power> objects, named iht, “relics”, which are stored within the island.350> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1120770] Once again, the text is capable of a deeper understanding.To see how, one must unpack the italicized statements one by one.Firstly, the gods Wa and Aa are instructed to enter “the enigmatically namedPlace-in-which-the-things-of-the-earth-were-filled-with-power,” that is, theyare required to enter some sort of structure, to be in or in proximity to it, inorder to accomplish whatever it was they were doing. This important point raisesyet another component of the scalar physics that I believe was a crucial elementof the ancient technology, and that is conciousness.351[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1120995]Secondly, note that the“Place-in-which-the-things-of-the-earth-were-filled-with-power” is another namefor the island itself, i.e., it is now a physical location that can be“entered.”Thirdly, they enter it in order to make use of “mysterious power objects” thatare themselves stored inside the island.This is beginning to sound an awfully lot like the mysterious “power stones” ofMesopotamian tradition that will be examined in the next chapter, and an awfullylot like Ninurta’s entry into the Great Pyramid to inventory its contents, anevent described in detail by Zechariah Sitchin in his Wars of Gods and Men.352[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1121182]But once again, we are far from making the case that the “sacred island” is tobe identified with Giza or its pyramids. That case will be made in a moment.Collins then makes some crucial observations about the history of constructionson the sacred island. According to Collins, “various subsequent stages in thecreation of the world involve a gradual progression” in the construction of a“Temple of the Falcon, while a further building, named as the Solar Temple, issaid to have been built on the site of an earlier battle, plausibly oneconnected with the destruction of the first divine inhabitants by the enemyserpent.”353 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1121363] AlanAlford, it should be recalled, argued persuasively in his book The PhoenixSolution that the (1) Great Pyramid, (2) the Second Pyramid, the Sphinx andTemples, and (3) the other structures at Giza represented three distinct phasesover a prolonged period of time in the construction of the Giza complex, withthe Great Pyramid representing the oldest, pre-Egyptian phase, the SecondPyramid, Sphinx, and temples representing a later, though still pre-Egyptian,phase, and the remaining structures the distinctively Egyptian phase ofconstruction.354 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1121552] Itis thus possible that the Edfu texts are referring to the same phasedconstruction phenomenon, though it should be observed that its first phase wouldbe far more ancient than what Alford proposes. 355[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1121742] Collins concludeshis remarks by stating that prior to beginning each new phase, variousconsecration rites were performed using the very same power objects as onceresided in the island.356[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1122332] E.A.E. Reymond seemsto concur with at least the general tenor of these speculations, for she herselfremarks “We incline to the opinion that experiences of a far distant past lie atthe heart of the Edfu myth of creation.”357[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1122505] Collins himselfconcurs: “The incredible significance of the Edfu material cannot be overstated,for theEgyptian priests, scribes and artists involved in preserving these traditionssaw them as very real events that preceded the rise of their owncivilization.“358 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1122753]"},{"pageContent":"2. THE STRANGE STORY OF THE ”ROSTAU“ It is Collins himself, however, who makes the identification of the “sacredisland” of the Edfu texts with the Giza compound.The key to this identification is to be found in the sacred island’s title“Underworld of the Soul,” a title given to it after the primeval conflictbetween the serpent, the “Great Leaping One,” and its original inhabitants: “Theterm ‘underworld’ is the same here as that used in the Heliopolitan texts todescribe the journey of the sun-god through the duat-undenvorld... 359[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1122930] It is this journeythat Osiris first undertook. And with Osiris comes the link to Giza, for in thefamous Inventory Stela, discovered at Giza in the nineteenth century, referenceis made to various structures on the plateau “including the Great Pyramid andGreat Sphinx.“ More importantly, it records ”the visit to Giza of King Khufu.”This is highly significant for it would appear that the ancient Egyptians werenot in synch with modern standard Egyptology, since Khufu reigned before Khafre,the latter being the King standard Egyptology believes to have built the GreatPyramid!360 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1123080] In otherwords, the Great Pyramid was said by the ancient Egyptians themselves to be ofgreater antiquity than current standard theory allows.But this is not all.The Inventory Stela “also makes reference to the ‘House of Osiris, Lord ofRostau’. Since the Sphinx is cited as being ‘north-west’ of this ‘House ofOsiris,’ it is thought by some writers to be a reference to the Valley Temple,which lies roughly east-south-east of the Sphinx monument.”361[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1123230] Collins himselfdraws the inescapable conclusion: “It therefore seems certain” that the “sacredisland” and home of the “Sound Eye” and all its environs “-with its field ofreeds, water-encircled island and temple complex - was almost certainly locatedat Giza.“362 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1123371]Giza, in other worlds, was directly associated with the “true Point of FirstCreation,”363 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1123570]referred to in the Edfu texts, as Collins puts it, it is an “attractivesupposition.” But if this is so, then it is also the true point of the “SoundEye” and the locus and center of the terrible conflict with the “Great LeapingOne” that brought an end to that first creation, and new, more bloodthirstyoccupants of the “sacred island.” It was, in short, the location of the weaponthat brought a cataclysmic end to a conflict in the pantheon and ruin to thepeople that wielded it.But Collins does mention another difficulty:> There is, however, one major problem - how might we reconcile the appearance> of the plateau today with the description of (the sacred island) as a temple> located beside a field of reeds, situated on the edge of a primeval lake> containing a small mound-like island?364> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1123719] Collins’ answer is “that in the eleventh millennium BC, low-lying areas east ofthe Giza plateau were regularly, if not permanently, flooded to create a shallowlake that may have encircled a small rocky island.”365[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1123860] Consequently, thefirst two phases of construction at Giza at least - namely the Great Pyramid,the Second Pyramid, the Sphinx, and the Temples - would seem to be millenniaolder than dynastic Egypt. With this in mind, it should be observed that thevery physical form of Giza, “mountains” or “mounds” in the form of the pyramidsemerging “from the waters,” sticking up over the surrounding lake, is itself avisible analogue to the Sep Tepi, to the First Time when the primeval moundemerged from the primeval waters, or medium. The whole compound is, in otherwords, suffused(or perhaps inundated would be a better word) with visibleanalogies of the scalar physics of the transmutative medium, even in the veryform of the lake and mounds/pyramids themselves.Recall, however, that the Edfu texts stated that the original mound disappearedback into the waters, only to reemerge as a new mound-island, with a new titleor function. There seem to me to be two possible ways to understand these ideasin view of the identification of Giza with the original sacred island of theFirst Time, and that is (1) either the pyramids/mounds disappeared under massiveflood waters and reappeared, or (2) the original structures present at the sitewere destroyed or partially destroyed in the conflict, and the currentstructures were built over the ancient sites as an attempt to rebuild andreconstitute the original island/mound of power. This may indicate that thecurrent Great Pyramid (and the Second Pyramid) may be copies, reconstructions,of something far older, whose remains may yet lie buried far beneath it.A further connection is highlighted by the term “Rostau.” Author Peter Goodgame,in an article entitled “The Myth and Religion of Osiris the God,” observes that“the word Rostau means underground tunnels” and as such “was simply another namefor the Giza plateau and the many tunnels underneath it.”366[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1124026] Goodgame notes thatthis understanding of the meaning of “Rostau” is “clarified by a stela (sic etpassim) that once stood between the paws of the Sphinx that is attributed toThutmose IV (c. 1400 BC). Line seven of this stela states that the Sphinx lies‘beside the house of Sokar... in Rostau.”367[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1124382]These points allude to still other connections to Mars, for these undergroundtunnels constitute a kind of “underworld,” and the Sphinx, of course, has itsown counterpart on the Martian surface with the famous “Face” at Cydonia."},{"pageContent":"3. THE MYSTERIOUS “SOUND EYE” As I outlined above, the mysterious “Sound Eye” may be a metaphor for the typeof electro-acoustic stresses in the medium that form a central component inscalar physics. Collins himself is alive to the possibility that somethingdangerous may lie far beneath the Giza complex, as the Edfu texts themselvesimply: “What was the... divine power source spoken of in the Edfu texts? Was itstill there beneath the limestone bedrock awaiting discovery, or had it beenremoved and destroyed long ago?“368[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1124529] Collins leaves nodoubts about the power attributed to it in the texts:> Illustrations of the House of Sokar show a fiery-orange bell-shaped> omphalos.... This object is placed in direct relationship with both a sacred> island... and the mound of creation, suggesting therefore that it was> synonymous with the ‘embryo’, ‘seed’, ‘egg’, etc. of the Edfu and Theban> creation myths, as well as with the Heliopolitan concept of the benben-stone.> Were we therefore dealing with the presence at the heart of the underworld> complex of some kind of enormous sacred stone associated with the potency of> cosmic creation? Did it embody the coming together, the crystallization, of> the universe’s creative power source?369> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1124706] On the basis of what I said earlier regarding the “Sound Eye” I believe theanswer to this is probably yes.But Collins adduces “one more tantalizing piece of evidence which hints at thepresence of something of extreme magical potency beneath the bedrock atGiza-Rostau.”370 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1124872]Spell 1080 of the Heliopolitan Coffin Texts states “This is the sealed thing,which is in darkness, with fire about it, which contains the efflux of Osiris,and it is put in Rostau. It has been hidden since it fell from him, and it iswhat came down from him onto the desert of sand.”371[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1125049] Collins thencomments that spell 1080> Points clearly to the fact that this powerful object has been sealed away in> total darkness. Yet despite its solitary confinement, Spell 1080 still tells> us that is has ‘fire about it;, implying that it emits some form of divine> fire or radiance, exactly what is stated in the Edfu texts in connection with> the nucleus of the underworld complex. That ‘the sealed thing’ is said to have> been ‘put in Rostau’, where it now lies hidden, seems doubly to confirm that> we are dealing with an actual physical object inside an underground world that> exists to this day beneath the sands of Giza.372> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1125312] As will be seen in the next chapter, the “sealed thing” resembles quite stronglythe “power crystals” and “Tablet of Destinies” that lay at the center of theMesopotamian accounts of a war for their control. Indeed, as we shall also see,Ninurta, when he makes his inventory of “power stones,” reserved one stone -whose destructive power is enormous, and which cannot be destroyed - for secretpreservation. It is my belief that all these things are one and the sameidentical object, a stone or crystal - a technology - that made the whole thing“work.”Collins is also alive to the possibility that the “Sound Eye” may represent somelost science and technology of sound. Citing other traditions and anomaliesdealing with sound, Collins mentions the Incan and Andean tradition surroundingViracocha who consumed “stones” by fire, thus enabling men to move large blocksby hand “as if they were cork.”373[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1125489] This was aided byindividuals who possessed “supernatural powers” that allowed large blocks to belevitated through the air “to the sound of a trumpet.”374[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1125665] The Mayans hadsimilar acoustic levitation myths,375[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1125806] as did theGreeks,376 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1125955] and therewere even contemporary reports of similar phenomena being used by the lamas ofTibet to levitate large rocks.377[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1126104] He even mentions thecase of nineteenth century American inventor John Worrell Keely, whose weirdacoustical inventions were observed by witnesses to be able to disintegrate thehardest rock with mere vibration after appropriate tuning of his devices by theinventor, and yet who, to his own frustration, discovered that somehow his ownphysical presence was required to make his inventions work!378[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1126257]This last fact recalls in a rather curious fashion the statements of the Edfutexts that the physical presence of Wa and Aa was required in the sacred islandin order to make its power work, an indicator again of effects associated withscalar physics, which explains such phenomena as the ability of people to subtlyaffect the structured potential of the local vacuum."},{"pageContent":"C. THE HUMAN VERSION: THE ULLIKUMMI TEXT Some researchers might be inclined to dismiss E.A.E. Reymond’s and AndrewCollins’ interpretation of the Edfu temple texts on the grounds that - while thetexts purport to refer to an extremely ancient conflict surrounding the “powerof creation” that was embodied at Giza - the temples on which the texts arefound are not that old.But how would the Hurrian Ullikummi texts379[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1126967] be explained?Undeniably ancient, these texts refer to a similar conflict, and often parallelthe conceptions of the Edfu texts in a rather astounding way. The text centerson the Hero-God Ullikummi’s birth from the mother-goddess, and his subsequentexploits. As will be seen as we proceed, the texts are certainly capable of acatastrophist interpretation. But they are equally capable of a “war”interpretation. The following passage is one example of this:> Kumarbi in his own mind began to speak:> “What name shall I put on him,> On the son whom the Fate-Goddesses and Mother-Goddesses gave me?> > > > > > Out of (her) body like a spear point he sprang -> He shall go!> > > Ullikummi shall be his name!> He shall go up to the Celestial Realm to kingship!> And he shall press down the beloved town of Kummiya!> He shall hit the sky-God,> And he shall pound him (into) salt,> And he shall crush him like an ant with his foot,> He shall break off Tashmishu like a [...] reed!> He shall scatter all the Gods down from the Celestial Realm like birds,> And he shall break them like empty vessels!”Note the reference to the “sky-god” which suggests a parallel with the Sumeriangod Anu. Then follows a passage reminiscent of Marduk’s conflict with Tiamat:> And he shall pound him (into) salt,> And he shall crush him like an ant with his foot,> He shall break off Tashmishu like a [...] reed!> He shall scatter all the Gods down from the Celestial Realm like birds,> And he shall break them like empty vessels!” Clearly this passage is capable of a catastrophist interpretation along thelines of Alford’s colliding and exploding planets, since the “gods” referred toare in the “Celestial Realm.” The “gods” or planets in this case are clearlyshattered, “broken like empty vessels.” But observe that it is equally capableof a war interpretation, a possibility that becomes stronger as we proceed.The text soon begins to display its own evidences of an underlying“paleophysics” as well, for the god Kumarbi then asks:> “Who will carry him (Ullikummi) to the [dark] earth> (So that) the Sun-God of the Celestial Realm> And the Moon-God shall not see him? The references to the “Sun-God” and the “moon-God” are indicators, once again,that the characteristics and symbols of various ancient gods strongly paralleleach other, the Sun-God resembling Egypt’s Ra and Mesopotamia’s Marduk, and theMoon-God resembling the Moon-associated gods Osiris and Thoth of Egypt andNanner-Sin of Mesopotamia. But what of the reference to “the [dark] earth?” Thismight possibly refer to the void of space itself, a reading in keeping with the“paleophysical” interpretations both of Alan Alford and Paul La Violette.But then follows a curious speech of the god Kumarbi:> And Kumarbi began to speak to the Irshirraas-Gods:> “Take [this child],380> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1127364]> And [treat] him as a gift,> And carry him to the dark earth> Hurry, hasten!> And put him as a spear point> Upon Upelluri’s right shoulder! Upelluri is an Atlas-like god who carries the heavens and the earth on hisshoulder. But what sort of “child” is this Ullikummi? What follows is a strangestatement:> In one day he shall grow a “yard”;> In one month he shall grow a “furlong”;> The stone which is at his head,> His face shall cover.” This text lends itself to a catastrophist interpretation very handily, for the“growth” of the “child” can be, and is, understood by some to refer to thegrowth of a comet’s visible tail as it approaches the Sun, and “the stone whichis at his head” would thus be the core of the comet itself.But there is another possibility, one which will loom larger as we proceed, andthat is that the text is describing construction, in this case, construction ofa pyramid. The “stone which is at his head, (which) his face shall cover” couldequally be the stone which covers the face of a pyramid.This interpretation of Ullikummi being some sort of “stone”child — whether thatof a comet or a pyramid — is made obvious by what immediately follows, whenUllikummi is presented to the god EnlilEllil, whom we have encountered before:> And Enlil lifted his eyes,> And he saw the child.> The child was standing before the Deity:> The child’s body was made of stone,> Of meteorite-stone. Here one has a little-noticed theme of some ancient texts, and that is thereference to stones as living things. But what is to be noticed here is thetranslation of “meteorite stone.”In this instance, catastrophism has intervened to construe the translation infavor of the theory, for as H.G. Guterbrock and Harry A. Hoffner, foremosttranslators of Hurrian texts, maintain, the word is best translated as “basaltstone.” Basalt, as it turns out, is a stone not readily associated with meteors,but rather with volcanoes, which suggests a different version of catastrophism,one dealing not with the growth of comets’ tails but with the growth of avolcano.But basalt can have some very strange properties. David Hatcher Childressobserved the massive basalt stones used in the construction of Nan Madol onPohnpei Island in the western Pacific:> One of the travelers from the Village Hotel had a pocket compass with him and> moved it along one of the basalt crystals on the wall of Nan Dowas. “Hey look> at this!” he called. His name was Sid, and he was from Michigan. We all looked> at his compass as he moved it along a horizontal block in the massive wall.> The needle spun around and around.> A geologist who was part of the group looked at it and said, “It is normal for> basalt to become magnetized like this as part of its cooling process, but it> should be magnetized vertically. The needle should not spin like that. These> stones are strangely magnetized.381> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1127541] Might these strange stones have been the product of a technology rather than avolcanic accident of nature? Basalt might have been superheated in a kind ofspinning furnace, with the molten rock spun at very high speeds, and thensuddenly cooled, polarizing the rock magnetically. But in any case the Ullikummitext is capable of more than one catastrophist interpretation.Immediately after the stone “child’s” presentation to Enlil, however, the lattermakes a very curious, and very strange statement if one were only dealing withcatastrophism, whether cometary or volcanic:> “This is an evil plan> Of no one but Kumarbi!> (Just) as Kumarbi raised the Sky-God,> So he raised this (basalt-)stone as (a) rebel against him!” This is the first hint that the war is a war of rebellion, a civil war in thepantheon. And note the context in which it occurs: the “raising” of “basalt”stone against “the sky-god.”The text continues:> When Enlil [ceased to speak] these words,> They put the child as a spear point> Upon Upelluri’s right shoulder.> He grew up, the (basalt-)stone,> And the strong [...] raised him:> In one day he grew one “yard”,> In one month he grew one “furlong”;> The stone which was at his head,> His face covered.> When the fifteenth day came,> The Stone had grown high.> And he stood in the sea on his knees (point)> Like a spear-point.> The Stone, he stood out of the water,> And his height was like [...],> And the Stone reached from the sea like a garment> Up to the “Place of the Belt. ”> The Stone, like a [...] he was lifted,> And he reached up to the temples and chamber in the celestial realm. The “meteor catastrophe” reading of the text now seems to be definitelyexcluded, since the text clearly refers to Ullikummi, who is “the Stone,”reaching up “from the sea like a garment,” a reference which would clearly favorthe volcanic catastrophist reading.But there is a reference in the text that would seem to exclude thatinterpretation as well, and that is the line that immediately follows, for the“Stone” reached up from the sea to “the Place of the Belt.” This would seem tobe a reference to the constellation Orion, and to the three stars that compriseOrion’s “belt.” And here the text now begins to take on its peculiar parallel tothe Edfu texts, and to their reference to the “Rostau,” for nowhere does onefind “stones” reaching up to heaven in connection to Orion’s belt other than atGiza, whose three main pyramids are arranged in the exact geometric analogue ofthe constellation!Consequently, both catastrophist readings of the text — as referring to a cometor to a volcano — would seem to be contraindicated by this statement. The textis referring to a real earthly site, and to its construction and use in thecause of that conflict and rebellion. The emergence of “The Stone” from the seaclearly recalls the parallel themes — including those of conflict — found in theEdfu texts.The Ullikummi text then continues with statements reminiscent of yet anotherepic, the Babylonian Enuma Elish, of a power capable of altering the verycelestial mechanics of local space:> And the Sun-God began to speak in his own mind:> “What swift God [is standing] in the sea?> His body is not like that of the [...] Gods.”> The Sun-God of the Celestial Realm turned [his face],> And he went out into the sea.> And the Sun-God held (his) hand to his forehead.> [...]> and from his anger> his [...] became altered.> When the Sun-God of the Celestial Realm saw the Stone,> The Sun-God [crossed again the horizon a second time.> [...u]p he traveled,> And to the Sky-God he went. Something, in other words, has unsettled the “Sun God,” i.e., the Sun, causingit somehow to become “altered.” This passage recalls a similar “alteration” inthe local celestial mechanics, that of the Babylonian “Sun God” Marduk, who“measured the structure of the deep” after his destruction of Tiamat in theEnuma Elish.In any case, a “council of war” is soon called, as Tashmishu, brother of theSun-God, cautions him about Ullikummi and his intentions:> “Why does he come...?> That matter about which he comes,> (that) matter is grave,> It is not to be cast aside.> It is strong, the struggle!> It is strong, the battle!> It is the uproar of the Celestial Realm!> It is the land’s hunger and death!” Once again, conflict and war is the context, but note again the multiple levelson which the text operates, for the “grave matter” that is “not to be castaside” is nothing less than “the uproar of the Celestial Realm.” That is, thetext may be - and it is my belief that it is - operating here on two levelssimultaneously, for the “uproar of the Celestial realm” clearly implies achaotic and unstable situation in celestial mechanics, as well as an actualrevolt or warfare in the pantheon itself. Were it not for the odd referencepreviously to the “place of the belt” one could perhaps dismiss these two levelsof meaning as just another metaphor for the catastrophe caused by an impact ornear miss of a planet with a meteor. But meteors and volcanoes do not neatlyarrange themselves in the geometric relationship of Orion’s belt.The violent destructive powers of the Ullikummi Stone are clearly attested bythe text:> And the King of Kummiya382> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1127759] set his face,> He set his face upon the dreadful (basalt-) stone,> And he saw the dreadful (basalt-) stone,> And from his anger his [...] became changed.> And the Sky-God sat down on the ground,> And his tears flowed forth like streams.> The Sky-God, his eyes tearful, spoke these words:> “Who can endure it any longer, this one’s violence?> And who can fight any longer?> And who can endure it any longer, this one’s fearfulness?” The Ullikummi “Stone” was clearly an object of great power, and once again itseems prudent to point out the resemblance of the Ullikummi text to the “Rostau”of he Edfu texts, and the resemblance of both to Giza. It seems a plausiblespeculation then to associate the Giza-Rostau-Ullikummi with weaponry of somesort.The Ullikummi text then alludes to yet another theme paralleled in other ancientNear Eastern texts such as the Enuma Elish, for it refers to the manipulation ofextremely severe weather as a weapon of war. Once the power of the “Stone” hasbeen lamented, Tashmishu> Called for the thunder-storms;> The rains and winds which break the rock for ninety “furlongs.”> ....> [...The Sky-God] took a stand to fight.> Then he took the battle gear,> And he took the carts,> And he brought the clouds from the Celestial Realm.> And the Sky-God set his face on the (basalt-) stone,> And he saw him. In other words, weather is again a weapon in a vast celestial conflict, only inthis case it is a weapon specifically directed against the Ullikummi Stone “inthe midst of the sea.” The scale of forces is thus cosmic on both sides, for alittle further on the Ullikummi text relates that the> (basalt-)stone his body [...]> [...]> And he shook the Celestial Realm. In spite of the breaks in the text, it appears that the Ullikummi Stone, reactedto this terrific weather weapons assault with a response that “shook theCelestial Realm,” i.e., by altering it at its very foundations. An even moreinteresting statement is related a little further on:> And the (basalt-) stone rose above Hebat and the temple:> So that Hebat could not hear news of the Gods,> And she could not see with her eyes the Sky-God ... Something, in other words, was interfering with communications.The destructive power of the Ullikummi is referred to somewhat later in thetext, when Ea-Enki goes to Upelluri to relay to him the news:> Ea began to speak again to Upelluri:> “Do you not know, O Upelluri?> Has no one brought you word?> Do you not know him,> The swift God whom Kumarbi fashioned against the Gods?> And that Kumarbi [has made] death plans against the Sky-God,> And fashions a rebel against him?> The Basalt-stone who grew in the water,> Do you not know him? Note now that the Stone that “grew in the water,” paralleling the Giza-Rostaureferences in the Edfu texts, is clearly associated with rebellion, andspecifically, with “death plans against the Sky-God.” It would appear then thatthe Ullikummi Stone is connected with the very power to draw upon and alter thepower of the heavens, i.e., it is able to utilize the fabric of the localspace-time medium itself.In any case, Ea-Enki formulates a plan to undo this power of the Ullikummi byundercutting its foundations:> And they shall bring out the former saw,> With which they cut apart the Celestial Realm and the Earth,> [And...] saw under the feet of Ullikummi, the Basalt-stone,> Whom Kumarbi raised as a rebel against the Gods. Ea-Enki then commands Tashmishu to> “...go and fight him again!> The Basalt-stone shall no longer stand as a spear-point!” A summary of what the text implies is now in order.> 1. It is clear that the passages of the Ullikummi text cited here are capable> of a catastrophist interpretation in two ways:> > > a. As a catastrophe involving comets or meteorites, and the resulting chaos> > and destruction caused by the impact on or near miss of the earth caused by> > a large enough celestial body, as the repeated references to the “Celestial> > Realm” would imply. But as was seen, the translation of “basalt-stone” as> > “meteorite-stone” was done in service of this interpretation, whereas the> > most noted translators of the text prefer “basalt-stone”, which would> > exclude this interpretation, and favor the following:> > > b. As a catastrophe involving massive volcanic activity, an interpretation> > favored by the text’s repeated references to this Stone arising “out of the> > sea.” But as was also seen, this interpretation cannot make sense of the> > curious reference to the “place of the belt” in connection with the “Stone,”> > a reference clearly implying some association of the “Stone” with the three> > stars of Orion’s belt. Thus,> > > 2. The repeated references in the Ullikummi text to the Stone standing out of> the midst of the sea not only parallels the similar picture of the Edfu texts> to the “Rostau,” the association of the Ullikummi with Giza would appear to be> strengthened by the reference to the Place of the Belt, i.e., to Orion’s belt.> Thus,> 3. The Ullikummi text refers to something clearly artificial, involving Stones> that rise “out of the sea,” and associates these stones with massive conflict> and disturbances in the heavens, and with a “rebellion.” The clear implication> of the Ullikummi text is that this place where the Stone rises out of the sea> is possessed of enough power to affect and destroy things on a celestial> scale.> 4. Like the Enuma Elish, the Ullikummi text also refers to weather as a> weapon, and clearly implies the alteration of the geometry of local space.> This alteration or destruction of the original geometry as a result of this> conflict and rebellion is itself not only a sign of that rebellion but a kind> of rebellion in its own right, since it no longer reflects the original order> of things, presumably the order that the “gods” or God originally ordained. Certainly impacts from comets and meteors have occurred and can wreak untolddestruction on the planetary bodies that endure them.But so can wars fought with weapons of sufficient power to scar whole regionsof, or to explode, an entire planet. And with the Ullikummi text and its obviousreference to Giza in the context of a conflict involving cosmically scaledforces, one is no longer looking at the metaphors for a naturalist religion of“exploded planet cults” ala Alan Alford. One is looking at very real, veryartificial structures that are no mere metaphors. This implies, howeverunbelievable it may seem, that the war was also real, that it wasinterplanetary, and that it happened millennia ago."},{"pageContent":"D.

Priorto the Deluge, the lengths are extraordinarily long, which has led mostconventionally minded scholars to dismiss the List’s historical value. Afterall, such extraordinarily long reigns means equally extraordinarily long lifespans, or at the very minimum, unusual permanence and staying power of a veryfew dynasties. Similarly, the assertion that “kingship descended” to the earthfrom the heavens is understood to be a metaphorical reference typical for theregion, as kings sought to legitimize their authority by claiming their divineright to rule by virtue of a descent from the gods.Secondly, note that 241,200 years passed from the “descent of kingship” to theDeluge itself.Thirdly, observe that the list is clearly divided into a pre- and a post-Delugeperiod by the succinct statement, “In 5 cities 8 kings; they ruled for 241,200years. Then the flood swept over.” Then follows the post-Deluge list, in whichthe reigns and therefore the life-spans of the kings and their associated citiesbecome progressively shorter, until at last they enter the realm of “reality”,becoming normal for human beings. In this, there is an odd parallel to thebiblical account of the life-spans of the pre- and post-Deluge lives of thePatriarchs and descendents from Adam.Fourthly, note that the total length of time from the Deluge to the end of theKings List is “28876 + X (ms. P4+Ha has instead: 3443 + X) years,” that is,28,876 years, give or take a few years depending on which manuscript traditionone follows.But what do these numbers, and the curious division of the List into pre- andpost-Deluge sections, mean? R. A. Boulay comments as follows:> The King List attributes reigns of legendary and incredible lengths to many of> the rulers of the earlier antediluvian kings. In this sense, it affirms the> enormous lifespans of the Patriarchs of the Old Testament.> These lifespans in the Sumerian King List has been a source of wonder and> puzzlement. By current standards, the numbers of the antediluvians are> completely fanciful. These huge numbers are consistent throughout the King> List and therefore seem not to be erroneous. While a rational explanation has> thus far escaped historians, most researchers feel there must be some> underlying logic to these large numbers since a parallel can be found in the> enormous lifespans of the antediluvian Patriarchs.384> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1128204] Indeed, since one very important Old Testament patriarch, Abraham, originatedfrom this region, the odd connection, plus the Old Testament’s own division oflife spans into two sections, the antediluvian, and the post-diluvian lifespans, where, like the Sumerian King List the life spans of the patriarchsdeclines progressively to what is now a normal human lifespan, the connectionwould seem to be more than coincidental.Something else is at work in both cases.Boulay offers one explanation, and that is that the reigns and therefore thelong life spans of the antediluvian kings is a reflection of the Sumeriannumerical system itself.> It was not unusual for the ancient to compute time by other than normal Earth> years such as, for example, in the Book of Jubilees, where a Jubilee year is> equivalent to 50 regular years. That is equal to seven week years (a week year> was seven years) and one year added for atonement, when all activities were> supposed to cease.> ...> (The Sumerians’) numerical system was sexagesimal in character and they made> use of the factor of 10 as well as 6. Thus the sequence 1, 10, 60, 360, 600,> 3600 takes on a special meaning in their mythology. If the duration of the> various terms of kingship are presented graphically, it becomes obvious that> this sexagesimal system underlies the fabulous numbers of the King List.> Called a SHAR by the Sumerians, the number 3600 appears to have a special> meaning in this list. It can be seen that with slight adjustment, the years of> reign of the Sumerian kings are divisible by this number. It indicates that> the term of reign for a Sumerian antediluvian king was presumably a “shar” —> probably renewable every 3600 years.385> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1128399] But this really solves nothing. In fact, it makes the problem of the abnormallylengthy reigns and life spans even more intractable, for if one were to multiplythe total length of the reigns of the antediluvian kings, 241,200 years, by thelength of a “shar,” 3600 years, one would obtain the figure of 868,300,000years, roughly one fifth the supposed age of the earth!Moreover, this “solution” does not really place the events referred to in theKings List in synch with any date for the cosmic catastrophe advanced by VanFlandern’s Exploded Planet Hypothesis. One is left with dates — 241,200 yearsago or 868,300,000 years ago — hovering in mid-air with no connection otherwiseto any historical or scientific events, such as the dates of Van Flandern’sMultiple Exploded Planet Hypothesis, which, it will be recalled, posited twomajor explosions at 65,000,000 and 3,200,000 years ago. And Boulay’s method of“resolution” places any historical basis for the Kings List far beyond thenormal reckoning of the Deluge as being ca. 10,500 B.C.It is the connection to the similarly long life spans of the Old Testamentpatriarchs that may in fact provide a resolution of the dilemma, for the book ofGenesis indicates the existence of yet another unit of time, a unit of 120years, which we may call a “Flood Year” for convenience. It should also be notedthat while 120 years is not a standard unit of significance in the Sumeriansexagesimal numerical system, it is nonetheless a unit easily harmonized withit.If one takes the ante- and post-diluvian ages of the kings from the Kings List,and multiplies it by this new number, 120 years, some very interesting resultsbegin to appear. The post-diluvian total reign of kings, 28,876 years,multiplied by this “Flood Year”, yields a date of 3,455,120 years ago, roughlythe same time as Van Flandern’s second major exploding planet event of 3,200,000years ago. And if one takes the antediluvian figure of 241,200 years from theKings List and does the same thing, one obtains a date of 28,944,000 years ago,which is very roughly one half of Van Flandern’s date for the earliest explodingplanet event of 65,000,000 years ago.386[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1128548]These results suggest that the connection between the biblical and Sumeriantraditions is not only more than coincidental, but viewed in this way, alsosuggest that the Sumerian Kings List is somehow tied to at least one, andpossibly both, of the celestial events of Van Flandern’s Multiple ExplodedPlanet Hypothesis. But let us note which event: the 3,200,000 years ago event,the one that Van Flandern originally favored as the “main explosion.”This is significant, for now there is a connection between an ancient textualtradition and the celestial catastrophes of Van Flandern’s Hypothesis. There aretwo hidden implications of this connection. First, it would imply that there wasa major flood event on earth ca. 3,200,000 years ago, with attendant meteoricbombardment and so on. Given that Van Flandern’s 3,200,000 years date is for theexplosion of a smaller, moon-sized planet, evidence of this event on earthshould be found, though it will not be of the major nature as that of the majorevent at 65,000,000 years ago. Secondly, the connection between the two alsostrongly suggests that this event was an observed event and, if one takes thisnew speculative interpretation of the Kings List at face value, an observedevent that is clearly tied to human history and civilization. This implies bothan antiquity to mankind and an antiquity of civilization predating standardacademic theory and the archaeological evidences supporting it. Thearchaeological evidence for our interpretation will be discussed later. In anycase, the Kings List establishes an important connection between an ancienttextual tradition and Van Flandern’s hypothesis.The Kings List, viewed in this way, also suggests one other thing highlyimportant for our discussion: it not only suggests a connection between theantediluvian kings and Van Flandern’s second “minor” event, but also suggestssomething far older, a connection to an even older time, and perhaps to evenolder, and much more catastrophic events.In any case, one may draw some basic conclusions from this chapter concerningthe timing and connections of the events:> 1. There was a “primordial revolt” soon after the initial creation of the> “primeval mound” from the primeval “waters;”> 2. This revolt may pre-date the 65,000,000 years event of Dr. Van Flandern, or> may be synonymous with it;> 3. A subsequent second event occurred ca. 3,200,000 years ago, which may also> be the event alluded to in the ancient texts describing the war; this> benchmark event was found to be roughly corroborated by the Sumerian Kings> List;> 4. A strong textual tradition exists which connects this conflict to serpents> and to Mars. And now, as they say, the plot is about to thicken..."},{"pageContent":"8. THE STORY OF THE STONES: A LITTLE MORE WHY > “The Hero had conquered the Mountains. As he moved across the desert... ”The Exploits of Ninurta "},{"pageContent":"A. THE TECHNOLOGICAL MOTIVATION From the Judeo-Christian traditions of the Fall of Lucifer, to the Hindu epicswith their legends of titanic wars of the gods and wanton slaughter, to theSumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians, and Greeks of antiquity, to theAztecs, Toltecs, and other indigenous nations of North and South America, and tothe Teutonic tribes of northern Europe and Scandinavia, almost every culture inthe world has a tradition of the warfare, and in many cases of the revolt, ofthe gods. The struggles and battles are epic in their scale, cosmic in thedegree of their slaughter, and titanic in their scale of destruction. Theweapons with which they were fought are so far-fetched — or advanced — that theywere literally described in almost magical science fiction terms: the“thunderbolts” or “arrows” or “darts” of the gods; they were “the divineweapons.”Many of these stories contain common elements, however, that in spite of thesupposed isolation of these cultures from one another, appear to indicate ashared source or sources for their legends. And one of the strangest commonelements to many of these legends concerns the theft or usurpation of someobject or objects of power belonging to one god or set of gods, by another godor set of gods. And quite often, these objects of power are “magic stones,” or“power crystals.”Thus, we come to one of the strangest motifs in the already strange hypothesisof a real, but very ancient, interplanetary war: What was the motivation forthis cataclysmic cosmic warfare? What were these objects? And most importantly,what happened to them and to the “gods” and/or “people” that wielded them? Aswill be seen, one motivation of the war in many traditions is for the control ofthese technologies of power."},{"pageContent":"1. A GLANCE AT THE BREADTH OF THE THEME The breadth of the tradition of ancient “stones” or “crystals” of power isimpressive, and before looking at the tradition that devotes the most detailedattention to it — the Sumerian — a glance at the wider context is in order.From Mesoamerica, the Mayan Popol Vuh recounts the giving of a “power-crystal,”called the “Giron-Gagal,” to Balaam-Qitze by “’the Great father’ ofPatulan-Pa-Civan, the Mayas’ version of Atlantis.”387[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1128917] According toAtlantologist Frank Joseph, the Giron-Gagal was a “symbol of power and majestyto make the peoples fear and respect the Quiches.” 388[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1129135] No explanation isgiven as to how mere crystal could do this, but the clear implication is that itwas a component in a technological or ritual-cultural matrix, or both.In Australia, aboriginal peoples have a tradition of a sunken “Land of Mystery”with a similar “power stone,” in this case a large “crystal cone” that had a “‘serpent’ winding up its length from bottom to top.”389[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1129276]Even the Slavs have their own version of the “power stone” tradition. Their“Alatuir” was not only a “magic stone” but “the source of ultimate power” thatresided at the very center of “Bouyan, a sunken island kingdom from which theancestors of the Slavic peoples migrated to the European continent from theWestern Ocean.”390 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1129493]And one must not forget to mention the Slavic tradition of “magic stones”without recalling the curious association of Russian mystic and painter NicholasRoerich with the so-called “Chintimani” Stone. From the Sanskrit for “magicalstone from another world,” many researchers have interpreted this, following thecatastrophist paradigm, to be a clear allusion to its being a meteorite. ButAtlantologist Frank Joseph reports that there is “an exceptionally clear quartzcrystal” now in the Moscow Museum that is the Chintimani Stone.As if that were not enough, this curious tradition is known in China and Japanas well, where the stone is known as the “Jewel- That-Grants-All-Desires.” Itwas believed to have once ”belonged to the Makara, a dragon- or dolphin-god,living in a palace at the bottom of the sea, underscoring its Atlanteanprovenance.“391 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1129710]Taken together, these disparate traditions would seem to underscore the idea of“magic stones” or “crystals of power” having once been components in atechnology of power and hegemony."},{"pageContent":"2. THE SUMERIAN TRADITION But no tradition underscores the role of “power stones” and their role in theWar of the Pantheon and the Revolt of the Gods more than does the Sumerian.392[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1129930] Two legends arecrucial in the exposition of this tradition: the Legend of Nergal andEreshkigal, and The Myth of Zu or as he is sometimes known, The Myth of Anzu.A. NERGAL, THE STORMING OF THE UNDERWORLD, AND THE “TABLET OF WISDOM ” According to Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley, the earliest of the two versions ofThe Legend of Nergal and Ereshkigal was found in what at first glance appears tobe a most unlikely place for the tablets of a Sumerian epic to be found: Tellel-Amarna in Egypt, and dates from the fifteenth or fourteenth centuries B.C!393[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1130175] In my last book onthe Giza Death Star hypothesis, I speculated on the possible though seeminglyimplausible link of the Babylonian god of Mars, war, revolt, and the underworld,Nergal, to the complex at Giza, and to the Martian ruins at Cydonia.394[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1130382] The Legend of Nergaland Ereshkigal in its Tell el-Amarna version, while not directly supporting thisvery speculative connection, certainly does not contradict it.In any case, the standard Babylonian version The Legend of Nergal and Ereshkigalrecounts in a very few short lines Nergal’s storming of “the Seven Gates of theUnderworld,” the names of the gates, and his oddly “biblical” six-day longlovemaking with the “legitimate” goddess of the underworld, Ereshkigal.395[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1130605]But curiously, the Egyptian Tell el-Amarna version of the legend contains atwist toward the very end of the text, which suggests a motivation behindNergal’s storming of the Seven Gates of the Underworld. Addressing the would-beusurper, the Queen of the Underworld, Ereshkigal, offers him an unusual deal:> “You can be my husband, and I can be your wife. I will let you seize> Kingship over the wide Earth! I will put the Tablet> Of wisdom in your hand! You can be master,> I can be mistress.” 396> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1130803] The implications are immediately obvious, for Nergal’s whole storming of theUnderworld, following the older Amarna version of the text, would appear to bemotivated by nothing less than a desire for global domination by means of sometechnology or symbol of authority represented by the “tablet of wisdom,” anobject that appears to be intimately connected to “Kingship over the wideEarth.”B. THE MYTH OF (AN)ZU: THE TABLET OF DESTINIES AND THE CAUSUS BELLI A much more detailed and suggestive glimpse into the technological motivationfor the War in the Pantheon is provided by the Myth of (An)Zu. Indeed, in thislegend one gains a glimpse into the characters of the main players, theirmotivations, and suggestions of the incredible technologies and science withwhich the war was waged.Here again the text comes in two versions. According to Sumerologist StephanieDalley once again, the “Old Babylonian” version consists of “a small portion ofthe tale” dating from “the early second millennium.”397[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1130953] The StandardBabylonian version, “dating to the first millennium BC” was discovered ontablets of three or four columns, most of which were “found on the Late Assyriansites of Ninevah, Tarbisu and Sultantepe,” although there is a tablet of unknownprovenance from this textual tradition of the legend in a museum collection inthe United States.398[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1131103]As Dalley notes, the whole story of the Legend “centres around possession of theTablet of Destinies.”399[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1131295] The text is evenmore curious however, for the odd resemblance it paints of the gods Ninurta andNergal:> The opening lines of the epic introduce the theme in the first person,> representing the singer or poet, and are very closely comparable to the> opening lines of Erra and Ishum. Nergal and Ninurta are quite close in some> aspects of their characters, and in Erra and Ishum the defeat of Anzu with a> net and the conquest of asakku-demons are attributed to Nergal/Erra. The fight> of Ninurta to defeat the asakku-demons is known from the mainly Sumerian epic> story of cosmic warfare called Lugal-e, and a companion story An-gim.400> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1131445] The similarities between epics of the themes and characters of the two godssuggests the possibility that Ninurta and Nergal might be one and the sameindividual. As outlandish as that might seem at first glance, Dalley herselfnotes that one line of the Erra and Ishum epic actually “assimilates Nergal withNinurta,” 401 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1131603] soapparently someone in ancient times noticed the similarity as well.In any case, the legend makes a number of important observations both aboutNinurta, the technological motivations for the war, and the technological meansby which it was fought. Ninurta is called “the powerful god, Ellil’s son, Ekur’schild, leader of the Annunaki, focus of Eninnu.”402[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1131760] Note the clearconnection between Ninurta and the Annunaki, the beings equivalent with the“Nephilim” who fell from heaven and interbred with human beings. Here Ninurta isclearly called their “leader,” and this makes another connection or associationwith the god Nergal likely, since the leader of these Nephilim in theapochryphal Book of Enoch is, like Nergal, clearly associated with an armedrevolt. 403 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1131926](1) “EKUR’S CHILD:” NINURTA AND NERGAL: IDENTIFICATION OR ASSOCIATION? The other reference — “Ekur’s child” — is equally if not much more important,for the word “ekur” not only means mountains, but also signifies the artificial“mountains” of the pyramids and ziggurats. In other words, Ninurta is clearlyassociated with pyramids, and if one recalls our “mountains ≈ planets ≈pyramids” equation, then Ninurta is simultaneously a “child”, i.e., one“intimately associated with” a planet, and with pyramids.This would seem to make his possible identification or association with Nergaleven stronger, for as I presented in my book The Giza Death Star Destroyed,Nergal is a god of war and rebellion, is associated with a specific planet,Mars, and may be associated not only with Egypt, but with pyramids, the pyramidsat Giza.404 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1132092] And asleader of the Annunaki, Ninurta — if one adopt the biblical viewpoint for amoment — is also clearly associated with the whole attempt to create a “hybrid”or “chimeric” race, part human and part “god.”However, even if one rejects this highly speculative identification of Ninurtawith Nergal, and only views it as a strong and highly suggestive association, itis an important association, for Nergal is a personage of some importance, aregular Sumerian “jet-setter” who manages to turn up under various names almosteverywhere in the ancient world’s various pantheons. Moreover, he is associatedwith some truly catastrophic activity.On the “activity” side of things, it is Nergal along with other gods in the“Sumerian” pantheon, one of them notably being Ninurta, who wields one of thegods’ favorite “divine weapons”: the “abubu” or “flood weapon.”405[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1132284] But Nergal also getsaround. Under the name “Erra” he is the “god of war, hunting, and plague,” and,notes Dalley, the etymology for Erra as “scorched earth” is “probablyincorrect,” though she does not state why.406[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1132466] Yet another of hisnames translates into “lord who prowls by night,”407[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1132648] a referencecuriously reminiscent of biblical descriptions of Lucifer.408[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1132789] Elsewhere Nergal wascalled “Erragal” and “Erakal” which were most likely the pronounced forms ofNergal according to Dalley, who adds the comment that the name was probablypronounced “Herakles in Greek.”409[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1132958] Under his Sumerianname Gibil, Nergal is also the god of fire.410[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1133140] Thesecharacteristics of Nergal will, as we see, bear strong resemblance to those ofNinurta as we examine the text, making it clear that Nergal is at least “partlyassimilated” with Ninurta. 411[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1133290](2) NINURTA AND NIMROD: THE TOWER OF BABEL MOMENT But enough about Nergal. Who is Ninurta?Dalley makes one very significant and highly suggestive comment in the glossaryto her book Myths from Mesopotamia under the entry for Ninurta, which she noteswas “probably pronounced Nimrod”! 412[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1133440] Nimrod was, ofcourse, the “mighty hunter” and empire-builder mentioned in the list of Noah’sdescendents in the tenth chapter of the biblical book of Genesis. In thiscontext, it is interesting that in the eleventh chapter the Tower of Babelincident is recounted. In other words, the context of the biblical accounts ofNimrod and the Tower of Babel suggests a connection between the two. And theconnection may be more than contextual.To see how, it is worth quoting what I said about the event in my book The GizaDeath Star Destroyed:> There is another event that bears mentioning with regard to the decline of the> paleoancient Very High Civilization and its presumably unified physics and> sophisticated technology: the Tower of Babel. The Old Testament affords a> significant clue into the event that transformed the unified and paleoancient> Very High Civilization into a multitude of squabbling and declined legacy> cultures that resulted from it. The story is recounted in Genesis 11:1-9:> > > 1. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.> > > 2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a> > plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.> > > 3. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them> > thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.> > > 4. And they said, Go to, let us build a city and a tower whose top may reach> > unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the> > face if the whole earth.> > > 5. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children> > of men builded.> > > 6. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one> > language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from> > them, which they have imagined to do.> > > 7. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may> > not understand one another’s speech.> > > 8. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the> > earth: and they left off to build the city.> > > 9. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there> > confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter> > them abroad upon the face of all the earth.> > I then commented as follows:> ...The “Tower of Babel Moment” permits a further speculation: could the “one> language” and “one people” be taken in the broadest sense, not only of one> natural human language and one civilization, but of one language of science, a> unified science and physics? And could the “one people” refer not only to that> one paleoancient Very High Civilization, but also to the unifying cultural> effects that “one language” and unified scientific worldview afforded it?> Nothing in the biblical account precludes these possibilities, and indeed,> there is a strong indication that the Tower may be the (Great) Pyramid itself,> if one understands the “top which reaches to heaven” to be a metaphor of the> Pyramid’s many dimensional analogs of local celestial mechanics. By a similar> line of reasoning, a unified physics and science is implied in the divine> observation that “nothing will be restrained from them, which they have> imagined to do.” Clearly the “Tower” was no Renaissance painting of vast> scaffolding and cranes groaning to lift massive weights to enormous heights.> Something else entirely was at work. In this context, it might not be going> too far to speculate that the destruction of the Tower of Babel may refer, in> oblique terms, to the destruction of “the Great Affliction” and “Weapon,” the> Great Pyramid.413 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1133590] In other words, the “Tower of Babel” was an “ekur”, a mountain ziggurat orpyramid, the possession of the physics and technology of which allowed itspossessor(s) to imagine to do “whatever they imagine to do” in the way ofchallenging the divine order. The “Tower” was, to put it succinctly, a verythreatening device, one well-suited to the ambitions of a Nimrod, a would beworld-emperor, of a Ninurta... of a Nergal.(3) NINURTA, “SUBDUER OF THE MOUNTAIN OF STONES” With all this being said, we may return to the examination of the Myth of(An)Zu, for a little bit further from the passage where he has just been called“Ekur’s child,” another passage places Ninurta once again in close associationwith pyramids:> Listen to the praise of the powerful one’s strength,> Who subdued, who bound the Mountain of Stones in his fury,> Who conquered soaring Anzu with his weapon... 414> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1133793] Ninurta, in other words, renders a “Mountain of Stones” harmless, since theclear implication is that whatever “mountain” is being talked about, to bind itwould imply that this “mountain” was being used for destructive purposes. Notealso that the Mountain of Stones in this case is associated with the god Anzu.In other words, by defeating Anzu and binding the “Mountain of Stones,”possession of the mountain has changed hands. Ninurta-Nimrod (-and-Nergal?) isnow in possession of it.But what weapons did Ninurta use to achieve this feat?The answer to this question follows a little further on in the text:> At his shout [> The south wind [> The powerful [ ] wind [> The mass [> Whirlwinds [> They met and [> The four winds [ 415> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1133984] The text, while in a greatly deteriorated condition, suggests that some form ofweather weaponry was used by Ninurta, a fact strongly reminiscent of Tiamat’sarsenal as recorded in the Enuma Elish. 416[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1134165](4) THE MOTIVATION FOR THE WAR: THE THEFT OF HEGEMONY-BESTOMING TECHNOLOGY What brought on this state of affairs was Enlil’s appointment of (An)Zu to highposition, a position in which the epic clearly records (An)Zu is tempted by theawesome power Enlil wields:> (Anzu’s) eyes would gaze at the trappings of Ellil-power:> His lordly crown, his robe of divinity,> The Tablet of Destinies in his hands. Anzu gazed,> And gazed at Duranki’s god, the father of the gods,> And fixed his purpose, to usurp the Ellil-power.> Anzu often gazed at Duranki’s god, father of the gods,> And fixed his purpose, to usurp the Ellil-power.> > “I shall take the gods’ Tablet of Destinies for myself> > And control the orders for all the gods,> > And shall possess the throne and be master of rites!”417> > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1134357]> > In other words, Enlil(called Ellil in the text) did not wield supreme power andhegemony in his own right; it was dependent on the possession of the “Tablet ofDestinies,” an object that conferred supreme power, a technology. More aboutthis “Tablet of Destinies” in a moment. In any case, Anzu steals the Tablet ofDestinies while Enlil was taking a bath, flees, and goes into hiding!418[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1134555]But there is something else to notice here: this is the second time we haveencountered the theft of the Tablet of Destinies, and it is the second time thata war ensued for their recovery. The first time was Tiamat’s theft of theTablet, and the subsequent war with Marduk, as recounted in the Enuma Elish.419[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1134696] One must view theseas two separate events rather than as two versions of the same event in that,other than their theft of the Tablet, the goddess Tiamat and the god Anzu’scharacters (not to mention their sex) are entirely different. Whereas withNinurta and Nergal we can be reasonably confident that the gods were at leastpartially assimilated by the ancients, and whereas we might even reasonablyspeculate that they were in fact the same individual underlying their variouslegends, with Tiamat and Anzu we cannot. We are dealing with two events, anextremely ancient one in the War with Tiamat, and a much less ancient thoughstill quite old event with the contest between Ninurta and Anzu. In other words,the Mesopotamian legendary tradition is broadly compatible with Van Flandern’sMultiple Exploded Planet Hypothesis, and its two planetary explosions at65,000,000 and 3,200,000 million years ago.But we must go further than this, for if Van Flandern’s two events are to beseen in connection with the Mesopotamian tradition as has been done here, thenit is clear that that tradition ascribes both events to a war, to the use oftechnology; both wars were brought about by the presumed theft or usurpation ofobjects or technologies that conferred supreme power. Both wars had the samemotivation, both had the same goal in the recovery of that technology, and bothresulted in the destruction of an entire planetary body in our local solarsystem. We are looking, in other words, at an extremely extended conflictspanning several millions of years, all for control or usurpation of atechnology that confers supreme powers of destruction or hegemony.This being said, we may now note the difference between the “First Act” -between Tiamat and Marduk - in this pantheonic war, recounted in the EnumaElish, and the “Second Act” — between Ninurta-Nimrod and Anzu — recounted in TheMyth of (An)Zu, for as will be seen in a moment, the latter myth clearlyconnects this technology to “mountains” and stones.(5) THE PANTHEON HOLDS COUNCIL: THE LIGHTNING WEAPON AND THE INACCESSIBLEMOUNTAIN At this juncture, predictably enough, the gods hold council to determine what isto be done about the theft, how to recover the stolen Tablet, and defeat Anzu.The first god to be addressed and requested to deal with the usurper is Adad,who is addressed in the following fashion:> “Powerful Adad, ferocious Adad, your attack cannot be deflected;> Strike Anzu with lightning, your weapon!> Your name shall be great in the great gods’ assembly,> You shall have no rival among the gods your brothers.420> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1134883] Adad’s lightning weapon recalls the divine weapons and planetary discharges ofthe “gods” recounted in chapter two.But even with such powerful weaponry in his possession, Adad demurs:> Adad answered the speech,> Addressed his words to Anu his father.> > “Father, who could rush off to the inaccessible mountain?> > Which of the gods your sons will be Anzu’s conqueror?> > For he has taken the Tablet of Destinies for himself.> > ....His utterance has replaced that of Duranki’s god!> > He has only to command, and whoever he curses turns to clay! 421> > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1135065]> > This passage is full of important clues as to the nature of the Tablets ofDestinies and the war that followed their theft. First, note the reference to“the inaccessible mountain” that implies Anzu has taken refuge there. Likewise,note that his possession of the Tablets of Destinies makes even Adad think twiceabout using his powerful “lightning weapon,” since Anzu’s possession of theTablet apparently makes him able to effect action at a distance: “He has only to“command” as opposed to Adad having to ”rush off” to the place where Adad is,the “inaccessible mountain,” in order to strike a blow at him.There is more to be observed here, for the text also seems to suggest that Anzuhas taken one technology — the Tablets of Destinies - and combined it withanother — the inaccessible mountain — to be able merely to command or effectdestruction at a distance. Finally, if one takes our “mountain equals planetsequals pyramids” equation from previous chapters and applies it here, then thispassage takes on a multi-leveled significance: the “inaccessible mountain” couldbe a pyramid — and the Great Pyramid’s candidacy for “inaccessibility would seemto be quite strong — or a planetary body, or both. In this respect, it isperhaps significant that the Tablets of Destinies may be an oblique metaphor forthe “destinies of the planets” in a culture suffused with astrological lore. Inshort, it may be a metaphor for the type of celestial mechanics and associatedphysics connected to the whole idea of plasma and scalar physics.422[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1135231]In any case, after Adad declines the dubious and risky honor of taking out Anzuand reacquiring control of the Tablets of Destinies, Gerra, who is identicalwith Nergal in this text, is addressed next, and pleaded with to use his “fireweapon” to “burn Anzu”, and the result is the same: Nergal, like Adad beforehim, declines the dubious “honor.”423[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1135517]This pattern is repeated again and again with other gods all declining the riskyattack on Anzu, until finally Ea formulates a plan to get Ninurta to do thedeed:> The Lord of intelligence, wise one who dwells in the Apsu,> Formed an idea in the depths of his being;> Ea formed intelligence in his heart.> He told Anu what he was thinking in his inmost being.> > “Let me give orders and search among the gods,> > And pick from the assembly Anzu’s conqueror.> > ...> > Have them call for me Belet-ili, sister of the gods,> > Wise counselor of the gods her brothers.”> > > ....> They called Belet-ilil, sister of the gods, to him...> ...> (Then) Ea told the idea in the depths of his inmost being.> “Previously [we used to call you] Mami> (But) now [your name shall be] Mistress of All Gods.> Offer the powerful one, your superb beloved,> Borad of chest, who forms the battle array!> Give Ninurta, your superb beloved...”> ...> [Mami listened to this speech of his...> [And Belet-ili the supreme uttered “Yes.” And she called her son into the> gods’ assembly,> And instructed her favourite, saying to him> > “....[I gave birth to all] the Igigi,> > I created every [single one of the Annunaki],> > And I created the [gods’] assembly.

The whole passage thus has about it theair of reality and authenticity. Note also the important sequence that war leadsto a flood with the repeated commands from Mami to “inundate” Anzu’sterritories.(6) THE CONTEST BETWEEN NINURTA AND ANZU What son can resist the impassioned pleas of his own mother? Ninurta certainlycannot, especially since in the context of the whole pentheonic council it isobviously backed with force. So, Ninurta and Anzu meet:> On the mountainside Anzu and Ninurta met...> (Anzu’s) mantle of radiance covered the mountain...> ...> Anzu listened to (Ninurta’s) speech,> Then hurled his shout furiously amid the mountains.> Darkness fell over (?) the mountain, their faces were overcast.> Shamash, the light of the gods, was overcast by darkness> ....> A clash between battle arrays was imminent, the flood-weapon massed.> ....> Clouds of death rained down, an arrow flashed lightning,> Whizzed, the battle force roared between them.> The powerful, superb one, Mami’s son,> ....> Set the shaft to the bow, drew it taut,> Aimed (?) the shaft at him from the bow’s curve.425> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1135886] Before proceeding further, it is important to note how this passage, if readwith the equation “mountains equal planets equal pyramids” in mind, yields asome very interesting insights. On this view, the “face” of the mountain onwhich the combatants are met could be either the “face” of a pyramid, or thesurface of a planet, or both. Ninurta raises his “divine arrow,” his plasmathunderbolt, ready to strike. If mountain is here viewed in the “planetary”sense, then once again enormous discharges are ready to “arc” from one planetary“god” to another.But then, suddenly, nothing happens:> But it (the arrow) did not go near Anzu: the shaft turned back.> Anzu shouted at it,> > “You, shaft that came: return to your reed thicket!> > Bow frame: back to your copse!> > Bow string: Back to the ram’s gut! Feathers, return to the> > birds!”426 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1136073]> > For readers of my Giza Death Star trilogy, and as we have also seen from PartOne of this work, this is a clear signature of the type of “time-reversed,”scalar longitudinal waves being reflected back on their target. The arrow shaftof Ninurta, Ninurta’s “divine thunderbolt” far from reaching its intendedtarget, bounced back to its origin! The explanation for this feat immediatelyfollows in the text, and it’s a breathtaker:> (Anzu) was holding the gods’ Tablet of Destinies in his hand.> And they influenced (?) the string of the bow; the arrows did not come near> his body.> Deadly silence came over the battle, and conflict ceased.> Weapons stopped and did not capture Anzu amid the mountains. 427> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1136270] Anzu, who had taken the Tablet of Destinies and fled to the “InaccessibleMountain” had not only turned Ninurta’s divine thunderbolt back on itself, buthad simply rendered all Ninurta’s arsenal useless. He had, so to speak, simplyturned off Ninurta’s war machine. There are only two ways to interpret thispassage in a non-catastrophist sense: either the effect was entirely magical, orit was entirely technological. And if the latter, it is a clear signature of theuse of scalar weaponry on Anzu’s part, the signature of a phase conjugatemirror.This should give one pause, for if this is so then the equation “mountain equalsplanets equals pyramids” means that Anzu has taken the Tablet of Destiny and hidit and himself in an “Inaccessible Mountain/Planet/Pyramid.” The war is bothplanetary and pyramidal in nature and scope.428[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1136447]In the face of this devastating debacle, the pantheonic council againdeliberates and decides that the only thing one can do in the face of thisqualitative and technological superiority of firepower on Anzu’s part is to not“let the battle slacken’ with a view to ”tire him out.“429[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1136752]This strategy of attrition does the trick, but only at a new cost:> Ninurta slew the mountains, inundated their proud pastures;> Inundated the broad earth in his fury,> Inundated the midst of the mountains, slew wicked Anzu.> And marrior Ninurta regained the gods’ Tablet of Destinies> for his own hand. 430> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1136934] Thus the Tablets of Destinies, the original causus belli, were not returned toEnlil, but kept by Ninurta for himself, in usurpation upon usurpation! Ninurta with his “Thunderbolts’, from a Sculpture in the Palace of Assyrian KingAsburnasirpal, ca. 800 BC032 [images/00032.jpg] But this is not the end of the story.> It seems that Ninurta had difficulty in relinquishing the ME to the pantheon> after he had retrieved them from Zu. Their vulnerability in the temple of> Enlil was recognized and it was decided to store them under the watchful eyes> of Enki....in the Abzu...> There is a myth directly related to the battle between Zu and Ninurta and the> events after that struggle. Ninurta’s Pride and Punishment has been> reconstructed from fragments found at Ur and Nippur. It tells what happened> after Zu handed the ME over to Ninurta.> ....Ninurta...laments the loss of the ME which he had possessed briefly, with> the awesome power that went with them. As the story continues, Ninurta makes a> trip to the Abzu where he is greeted joyously by Enki (who) praises him as the> victor over the “bird” (Anzu) and as an unrivaled hero whose name will be duly> honored by all.> This blessing, however, does not satisfy the ambitious Ninurta. As the myth> states, “On the whole universe the hero Ninurta set his sights,” or in other> words, he coveted the ME and their power. Ninurta demanded that Enki release> the power stones to him.“431> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1137100] That is, the ME were some sort of technology that allowed one to tap into the“power of the universe.” What was this all-powerful “ME”, what were theseenigmatic and mysterious Tablets of Destinies? The answer to this all importantquestion must wait until the next chapter. For now we must remain focused on thetotal context necessary to answer this most important question."},{"pageContent":"B. THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH: THE TECHNOLOGICAL INVENTORY But exactly what happened to the ME after the defeat of Anzu by Ninurta?As I indicated in the first book of my Giza Death Star Trilogy, The Giza DeathStar, the victors in the struggle led by Ninurta perform an inventory of thevanquished foe’s technology, slating some of it for use elsewhere, and part ofit for destruction.Another ancient Mesopotamian legend, The Exploits of Ninurta, enumerates thisinventory at great length, after a brief introduction outlining the familiarmotivations of the war: to recapture the ME.In this legend, having vanquished the “mountains” arrayed against him, Ninurtawas reminded by Aruru, Enlil’s elder sister, that he had not yet “fixed thedestinies of the warriors that you have slain.” An interesting comment thenimmediately follows in the text: “The Lord (Ninurta) then addressed the U stone.He defined (?) its typical behaviour. The Lord spoke to it in anger in the Land,Ninurta, son of Enlil cursed it.”432[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1137307] In other words, itis clear from the text that the “warriors” referred to are none other than the“power stones” Ninurta seized from Anzu and coveted for his own. Then follows alengthy inventory, where Ninurta “fixes the destinies” of each stone, or groupof stones. In reading the following lengthy excerpt, it should be rememberedthat specific modern equivalents of the names of stones are the guesses ofmodern scholars.> “U stone (emery), since you rose against me in the Mountains, since you barred> the way (2 mss. have instead: seized me) so as to detain me, since you swore> to put me to death, since you frightened me, Lord Ninurta, on my great throne;> you are powerful, a youth of outstanding strength: may your size be> diminished.

The whole lengthy process is dimly evocative of thebehavior of the western Allies after World War One and Two toward their formerenemy, Germany. Some of the defeated side’s technologies were confiscated by thevictors and carted off, to be used, or modified and then used in differentapplications, elsewhere. Other technologies were simply forbidden to bedeveloped by the vanquished. And a few especially threatening technologies andweapons were simply smashed up and destroyed.The principle by which Ninurta makes his determinations and “fixes thedestinies” of the power stones is a simple one, devolving into two basicclasses: (1) those which were directly deployed against him, or from which heexperienced grave personal danger to his life or power or the power of the“gods,” were destroyed; and (2) those that were not so deployed or whichconstituted no direct threat in and of themselves, were preserved, and oftenremoved and used elsewhere. As will be seen, there are also two special cases."},{"pageContent":"1. STONES TO BE PRESERVED AND ADAPTED TO OTHER USE There are forty-one named stones in the text that are preserved and usedelsewhere. These are the Cu, Gasura, Esi, Kagina, Jicnugal, Ducia, Nin, Gug,Zagin, Amal-Pa-Ed, Laba, Jurizum, Gug-gazi, Marhali, Egi-saga, Girin-Hihiilba,Anzugulme, Nir-muckir, Gazi-musud, Marhuca, Hactum, Durul, Cigcig, Engen,Ezinum, Ug-gun, Hem, Madanum, Sajgirmud, Mursum, Kurgaranum, Bac, and Cimbistones. Given that there are some breaks in the text, the possibility that otherstones, whose names are now lost to history, cannot be discounted.Many on this list — the Ducia, Nin, Gug, Zagin, Amal-Pa-Ed, Laba, Jurizum,Gug-gazi, Marhali, Egi-saga, Girin-Hihiilba, Anzugulme, Nir-muckir, Gazi-musudStones - were to be preserved and apparently used for ornamental and ceremonialpurposes, since Ninurta decreed that they were to be “decorated with preciousmetal” and that “foreign lands” would prostrate themselves before them.In the case of the “Kagina Stone,” whose “surface reflects the light,” Ninurtadecrees an odd fate. It would, he said, be used “as a judge in foreign lands,”and that it therefore should “live.” A similar destiny for use in officialfunctions awaited the “Jicnugal Stone,” yet another stone connected withluminous brilliance, for its “body (shone) like the daylight.” Ninurta, as hasbeen seen, decreed that it would be the “seal-keeper” of “the treasury of theland,” perhaps indicating that it played some special security function inguarding a place of wealth.A. THE “CU STONES, ” “GASURA STONES, ” AND “HACTUM STONE“ But three stones in this list are worthy of some special attention, for unlikethe others, they appeared to have been more directly components of a weapon ofsome sort, but they, unlike the other stones in this category, were preserved.The “Cu Stone” was credited by Ninurta to have “attacked against my weapons.”The “Gasura Stone” is similarly accused of having “stood fiercely against melike bulls” and of “having tossed your horns in the dust at me like wild bulls.”These stones therefore had a clear weapons application. Ninurta, as has beenseen, decrees that his own “terrifying splendour will cover” the stones and thatthey would be shaped by a “goldsmith” to “form a matrix for his creations.”The “Cu” and “Gasura” Stones were thus to be subjected to intense heat, andmolded or adapted to some other use, in spite of their original application asweapons.The “Hactum Stone” was also clearly a weapon, having “cried out” against Ninurtafrom its place “in the Mountains.” Additional clues are given in the text thatit “yelled fiercely with wild battle yells,” indicating that it was possibly acomponent in a weapon of an acoustical nature.434[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1137871] Like the “Cu” and“Gasura” Stones, however, the “Hactum” Stone is apparently preserved, forNinurta enigmatically states “Because of your digging, ditch shall be yourname.” Apparently it was preserved because it was easily adaptable to uses thatwere not necessarily military, but which used its destructive potential in otherpractical ways.Finally, the fate of the “Durul” Stone should be mentioned, for as the textindicates, it was a sought commodity of “connoisseurs” of precious metals.Ninurta thus decrees that “foreign nations shall pursue you,” suggesting that itwas removed and sold."},{"pageContent":"2. STONES TO BE DESTROYED In addition to some special cases to be noted in the next section, there arestones that are obviously weapons and that could not be adapted to other uses.These were destroyed by various means.A. THE “SAJKAL, GULGUL, AND SAJJAR” STONES The “Sajkal” Stone is accused by Ninurta as having “flown up against me.” The“Sajjar” Stone “shook (its) head” and “ground (its) teeth” against Ninurta. Butthe most interesting and suggestive property of any of the stones is thatassociated with the “Gulgul” Stone,” which Ninurta states had “sparked lightningagainst me,” that is, it was capable of producing enormous electrostaticdisplays and somehow utilizing the same as a weapon, as was seen in chaptertwo.435 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1138345]These three stones share a common and complex fate. Ninurta decrees that the“Sajjar” stone would be smashed and pulverized by the “Sajkal” stone and thatthe “Gulgul” stone would also be a part in its destruction. All three would thenbe “discarded as contemptible and valueless.” This would perhaps imply thatthere was some functional relationship between the three stones to begin with,and that a certain order had to be followed in the sequence of theirdestruction. Alternatively it might imply that the only things capable ofdestroying the “Sajjar” Stone was the “Sajkal” and “Gulgul” stones, and that allthree stones are difficult to destroy.B. THE “U” STONE The “U” Stone has earned Ninurta’s hostility by being the stone that “barred theway” (or, alternately, “seized me”) so as “to detain me.” Ninurta orders thatits size “be diminished” and that a “mighty lion” should tear it to pieces. Inother words, its size is somehow related to its power, and accordingly its sizeis to be “reduced” by breaking up the stone. The “U” Stone thus inhabits anambiguous destiny, either being altogether destroyed, or merely broken up andpreserved in other smaller forms.The “Na” Stone appears to be similar in its functions, for it suffers a similarfate after having defied Ninurta and “bewitching (his) powers.” In one of themore colorful metaphors found in the various “destinies of the Stones,” Ninurtaorders that it be “worked on like a pig,” be “used for nothing,” and both“reduced to tiny fragments,” and “reduced ... liquid.” The stone, on otherwords, appears to have been pulverized, liquefied, and then “discarded,”whatever terrifying powers it once enabled were to be poured out like water onthe desert.Of the “Algame” Stone not much is said. Ninurta notes it made no provision “toassist my progress,” and states simply that it should “be the first to go intomy forge,” implying that it was melted down and destroyed, or perhaps adapted ormolded for some other purpose.The “Jir-Zu-Jal” Stone, noted for “duplicity” in the text, shares a similarfate. It is “ripped... like a sack” and smashed into “tiny pieces.”Finally, the “Iman” and “Alliga” Stones are said by Ninurta to have “cried outagainst me” from within “the Mountains,” and of having “fiercly uttered bulletyells,” suggesting once again the primacy of acoustical phenomena to whateverweapon was deployed against Ninurta. To these, Ninurta decrees that he “shallenflame you like fire, like a storm I shall overturn you....I shall rip you likeweeds.” These stones, too, in other words, were broken up and destroyed."},{"pageContent":"3. SPECIAL CASES A. THE “CAGARA” STONE The first special case is that of the “Cagara Stone.” Though it occurs later inthe text than that of the second special case, it is treated first here becauseit would seem to be of lesser importance than that of the “Elel Stone” whichpreceded it. The “Cagara Stone” is accused of smashing its head “against anyonetraveling in the desert.” Like the other stones, it was located “in theMountains” where, when Ninurta was otherwise occupied, it had “tried to trampleon me.” Ninurta’s decision concerning its “destiny” is somewhat peculiar, for he“discards it on the dais” of Ninhursag’s “resting place.”What does one make of this? Clearly it departs from the pattern associated withthe other stones that had been used against Ninurta, yet, it is preserved,although apparently hidden. This may be because it simply could not be destroyedwithout great difficulty. This possibility brings us to the second special case.B. THE “ELEL” STONE An even more special case is represented by the “Elel stone”. Let us recallNinurta’s opening words: “Elel, intelligently you caused terror of me to descendon the Mountains where discord had broken out. In the rebel lands you proclaimedmy name among my people who had banded together.” Thus far, the Elel Stonesounds like many others that were not used against Ninurta, and hence, itseventual preservation would seem to be motivated by that fact. But not so, ifone reads carefully what later follows: “Nothing of your wholeness shall bediminished (?). It shall be difficult to reduce your mass to small pieces....Youshall be greatly suited to the clash of weapons, when I have heroes to slay. Youshall be set up on a pedestal in my great courtyard.” In other words, the “ElelStone,” whatever it was, was difficult if not impossible to destroy, and itsapplication as a weapon was clear and obvious to Ninurta. Hence, rather thanletting it remain in its “Mountain,” pyramidal home, Ninurta removes it. It issafe to say that it was essential to the “Mountain’s” functioning as a weapon.Given what has been speculated and argued previously, that some scalar weaponrywas involved in the destruction of the missing planet(s), the “Elel Stone” wouldappear to be a crucial component of this technology. Hence — and this is quitethe crucial point — the “Elel Stone” was lost to history, secreted somewhere,and may, like the “Cagara Stone” therefore still exist. If the Sumerian originsof the text are any clue, then it may still exist in Iraq, buried beneath theshifting sands of the ages.436[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1138654]"},{"pageContent":"C. THE IMMEDIATE LEGACY: CONCLUSIONS What emerges from this examination is rather chilling, for it will be apparentthat the “Story of the Stones” and Ninurta’s inventorying activity parallelsanother, though less ancient, myth: the Fall of Lucifer and the removal of thelapis exili, The “Stone of Exile” from his crown.There is, however, a significant difference. Not only is there a clearindication that the function of many of the specifically weaponized stones is“acoustic” in nature, in keeping with a possible weapon based on scalar physics,but there is also an indication that two of these stones in particular were sopowerful and impervious to destruction that they could only be removed andhidden, thus allowing the possibility that, while lost, they may still exist,and exist somewhere on the earth at that.Equally important is the fact that the text seems to confirm our equation in aprevious chapter that not only associates “Mountains” with “planets” in theformulary of catastrophists, but with the e-kurs of the Sumerians, the man-mademountains of the Pyramids and Ziggurats. Thus, if> Mountains ≈ Planets ≈ Pyramids,then it is clear that an inventory is not only being taken of objects inside apyramid, but it is equally clear that the best known example of a Pyramid fromwhich there is clear evidence that something has been removed is the GreatPyramid.This equation thus casts Zechariah Sitchin’s “Pyramid Wars” in a whole new lightand context, for now, far from being events set merely on earth, the planetarycomponent of the equation would indicate that these wars were cosmic in theirscale, ferocity, and significance.Clearly, if the inventory of the power stones that forms the bulk of theExploits of Ninurta are identified with the Tablet(s) of Destinies stoleninitially by Tiamat and later by Anzu, as there is evident reason to believe,then by the same token, it is also evident that at least some of this awesomelydestructive technology survived the last known war for their possession.And the clear association of these “stones of power” with the “ekurs” orartificial mountains of the pyramids and ziggurats would suggest where one withsufficient money and technology might look to find them again.But exactly what were the original Tablets of Destinies? And why fight such acosmically destructive war over, and with, them?"},{"pageContent":"9. THE ENIGMA OF THE TABLETS: WHAT WERE THE “TABLETS OF DESTINIES”? > “The ME ... has no equivalent in English and no translator has thus far been> able to provide a satisfactory explanation of the term...

Boulay. The question that now inevitably occurs is what exactly were these “stones ofpower”? What exactly were the “Tablets of Destiny” or, following Dalley’stranslation, “Tablet of Destinies”, or following Sitchin’s translation, “Tabletsof Destinies”? This enigma, in any of its variants, is one of the centralriddles to be solved for anyone taking the war scenario of the ancient texts attheir word. After all, if a war were fought to possess or to regain them becausethey conferred “the power of the universe” then obviously their possessionconferred tremendous power to their owner. Merely to assert that they were aprimary cause of this war is not enough, one must understand why they were acause of that war, and to understand why they were, one must understand whatthey were, with as much precision and exactitude as possible.From the previous chapter it would seem obvious that Zu’s theft of the Tabletsfrom Enlil challenged the latter’s hegemony. It would seem equally apparent thatthey were somehow used by Zu in his war against Ninurta, that is, it would seemthat the Tablets of Destinies either were weapons of awesome power, or that theycould be used as such. And finally, it would appear that Ninurta’s inventory ofthe “stones” after the recovery of the Tablets of Destinies is somehow related,i.e., the inventoried stones may be components of the Tablets of Destinies. Butthis really does not advance us much further toward solving the riddle of theseenigmatic “stones of power.” And this situation is not aided by the fact that insome instances it appears that the Tablets of Destinies could be used forcommunications.Part of the enigma lies in the fact that the term “Tablets of Destinies” itselfis an uncertain translation, an academic convention that has become acceptedmerely through widespread use. R.A. Boulay points out the difficulty fewmainstream Assyriologists are willing to admit: no one knows exactly what theywere, and the translation of the word “me” (pronounced like the month May) as“stone” or “tablet” is simply at best an educated guess:> The story of (An)Zu must have had a strong impact on the minds of ancient> peoples for it concerned a struggle for power within the pantheon itself. It> actually concerns the theft of the ME or “power stones” from the possession of> the chief god Enlil and their recovery by his champion, the god Ninurta.

They were, first of all, information or objects containing information,> that allowed one to tap into “the power of the universe;”> 2. They were objects of technology that in use or conjunction with the “ekurs”> or “mountains of stone” - the ziggurats and pyramids of the ancient world -> allowed one to access that power, and thus wield a global hegemony by virtue> of being able to manipulate that power in a variety of ways;> 3.

We are still no nearer a solution to the riddle; we havemerely outlined its complexity.Clearly a more systematic approach is needed, one that pieces together aplausible picture of what the Tablets of Destinies were from the twin tracks ofmyth and of physics; the interdisciplinary approach of what I have termed“paleophysics” is tailor-made to answer precisely such questions. One might evensay it is tailor-made to answer this specific question."},{"pageContent":"A. THE MYTHOLOGICAL COMPONENTS AND THE POSSESSORS OF THE TABLETS"},{"pageContent":"1. TIAMAT AND MARDUK The entry into the solution of the riddle lies first in the possessors of theTablets of Destinies. The reason why is simple: the possessors of the Tabletsare the least ambiguous concepts in the whole textual and conceptual complexsurrounding the mysterious objects. The texts are clear about who possessedthem, and more or less clear about the order of their successive owners. Thesetwo things - the possessors and the order of the possessors - afford the keythat will begin to unlock the riddle.The first “illegal” owner of the Tablets, who had stolen them, is of course,Tiamat. It will be recalled that the Enuma Elish indicates she gave them at somepoint to Kingu, one of her allies in her revolt and war. As we noted in ourinterpretation of that epic, Tiamat begins to use weather weapons in her waragainst her enemies, the clear implication being that the mysterious Tabletsgave her the power to manipulate weather.Now recall the “unified intention of symbol” for a moment, and remember thatTiamat is a multi-leveled symbol operating on several different levelssimultaneously. At the most prosaic level, we have argued that she is a realperson of some sort, and the name “Tiamat” itself may be a titular usage for theruler or even a succession of rulers of a particular “region”, a particularplanet. We also saw that the name Tiamat can function as a symbol of the MilkyWay. Finally, we recall that her name may also mean “primordial waters,” or “theocean of the deep.” And following the paleophysical paradigm, this “primordialdeep” or “ocean” in turn functions as a symbol of a transmutative aether ormedium, of the materia prima. And it should be noted, we learn these thingsabout her after her theft of the Tablets of Destiny. Thus, it seems reasonableto conclude that her possession of them in some sense conferred upon her theability to influence all these things. Once again, to paraphrase the Lugal-e,they conferred upon her “the power of the universe.”Thus, the complex matrix of conceptual levels of meaning associated with“Tiamat” are the following:> 1. Personal Ruler or succession of rulers (of);> 2. A Planet;> 3. The “Deep” or “Primeval Waters,” understood as the transmutative medium or> material prima; and,> 4. The Milky Way galaxy. As the Enuma Elish relates, however, Tiamat is destroyed by Marduk. And notsurprisingly, Marduk has his own multi-leveled set of associations. TheSumerologist Stephanie Dalley informs us that the name “Marduk” may mean“bull-calf of the Sun.”440[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1140508] Marduk, like hisEgyptian “cousin” Aten-Ra and his Hindu cousin Rama is a “sun god.” But DeSantillana and Von Dechind also point out that Marduk is associated with theplanet Jupiter.441 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1140700]Like Tiamat then, Marduk in the Enuma Elish is not only a personal ruler, but isalso associated with a planet and also a star, i.e., with massive bodies.According to the Enuma Elish, after his defeat of Tiamat, Marduk then(re-)measured the “structure of the Deep.” In other words, the implication isthat Marduk recovered the Tablets of Destinies, and with their assistance“measured the structure of the Deep”, an operation that was necessary sinceTiamat, the exploded planet, was no longer in the picture, and the localcelestial mechanics and geometry had changed drastically. With this, thestructure of the Deep, of that transmutative medium or materia prima in localspace, had been altered, and hence its new geometrical characteristics had to beascertained anew. The Tablets of Destinies thus appear to give Marduk the powerto do just that. Thus, the Tablets have some intimate connection to thegeometries of space and time of the local system.Thus, one has a similar if not identical list of meanings or levels associatedwith Marduk, or over which Marduk has “kingship” or power. Marduk is a> 1. Personal Ruler, or succession of rulers (over);> 2. The Sun> 3. A planet> 4. The “deep,” or transmutative aether. The situation changes somewhat, though, with the next series of owners andpossessors of the Tablets of Destinies: Enlil, Zu, and Ninurta."},{"pageContent":"2. ENLIL, ZU, AND NINURTA Presumably the Tablets of Destinies were passed on from Marduk to Enlil. Here,of course, things took another turn for the worse, as the Tablets were stolenagain, this time by Zu. Ninurta, Enlil’s son, was sent to lead the effort torecover them, and another terrible war ensues, ending in the defeat andexecution of Zu, Ninurta’s recovery of the Tablets and his Inventory of theStones. As was seen in the previous chapter, however, a new association hasentered the picture, and this is the relationship:> Mountains ≈ planets ≈ gods ≈ pyramids(or “ekurs”). While in possession of the Tablets, Zu waged a war with Ninurta similar in itsferocity and the types of weapons - some implying weather weapons - as was usedby Tiamat after her theft of the Tablets. And this likewise implies once againthat there possession conveyed the “kingship” or power over those things. So, Zuis> 1. A Personal Ruler or succession of rulers (over)> 2. A “mountain”, which is associated with> 3. A planet, which is now also associated with> 4. A pyramid, or “ekur”. The obvious association of the last item with stones should not be overlooked.Similarly, Ninurta after his victory and the recovery of the Tablets, performshis now celebrated “inventory of the stones,” in which he destroys some andpreserves others. But let us recall the strange connections of Ninurta, and theassociations that those connections bring to the light. Stephanie Dalley statesthat Ninurta was not only a warrior God, but was “probably pronouncedNimrod.”442 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1140895] As such,Ninurta is associated with that famous “tower that reaches to the heavens,” anallusion clearly associating him with a pyramid.443[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1141077] This tower, we learnfrom Genesis, was of concern because it would enable mankind to do whatever ithad a mind to do. Its power, in other words, was “universal,” and hence God tookthe decision to destroy it and to confound mankind’s language. Let us recallthat for the Mesopotamians, this “ekur” or tower, or pyramid, was the DU-AN-KI,the “bond heaven-earth,” coupling the earth to the heavens and vice versa. Thisstrange reference would seem to associate the DU-AN-KI with the Tower of Babel,and both in turn to the only structure in that region to clearly embody bothcelestial and terrestrial geometries in its dimensions: the Great Pyramid.444[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1141360]"},{"pageContent":"B. A SUMMARY THUS FAR At this juncture, it is worth pausing once again to summarize the cluesassembled thus far. By sifting the evidence from the texts carefully, we knowthat the Tablets of Destinies> 1. Convey universal power, or the power of the universe, to their possessors;> 2. Were associated with electromagnetic energy, since they are referred to as> ME-LAMs, or light emitting crystals, and their theft causes “radiance” to> depart;> 3.

THE MYTHOLOGICAL COMPONENT AND THE MEANING OF “DESTINIES” IN “THE TABLETS OFDESTINIES” One of the most significant clues as to what the Tablets of Destinies were maylie in the second term of the phrase used to describe them, “Destinies.” Thisterm strongly suggests some connection to the pervasive role that astrologyplayed in the ancient Mesopotamian cultures. The movements of the stars andplanets, after all, were the movements of the “gods” themselves, decreeing thefates or “destinies” of things on earth below. But where does this belief comefrom, and why? No one really knows, but the famed Egyptologist E.A. Wallis Budgedoes provide a significant clue in his books Amulets and Superstitions, a studyof ancient Middle Eastern magical artifacts.> The Sumerians and Babylonians believed that the will of the gods in respect to> man and his affairs could be learned by watching the motions of the stars and> planets, and that skilled star-gazers could obtain from the motions of and> varying aspects of the heavenly bodies indications of future prosperity and> calamity. They therefore caused observations to be made and recorded on> tablets, which they interpreted from a magical and not astronomical point of> view, and these observations and their comments on them, and interpretations> of them, have formed the foundation of the astrology in use in the world for> the last 5,000 years. According to ancient traditions preserved by Greek> writers, the Babylonians made these observations for some hundreds of> thousands of years, and though we must reject such fabulous statements, we are> bound to believe that the period during which observations of the heavens were> made on the plains of Babylonia comprised many thousands of years.445> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1141644] It is the pervasive habit of recording these astrological observations, and thesheer amount of such tablets, that surely led Assyriologists and translators totranslate the term “Me” and “Me Gal Gal” as “Tablets of Destinies.” And theireducated guess, as will be seen in this chapter, was much more appropriate thanthey might have cared to know!But notice something else that Budge brings to our attention: there is atradition in the cultures of the Middle East that these observations extend backto a period of time hundreds of thousands of years before the advent of Sumerand Egypt themselves! The Sumerian and Babylonian astrological sciences, inother words, were a legacy, and a declined legacy at that, of something farolder, and as we shall see, something far more sophisticated.This last point may be more fully understood by asking a very obvious question:Why was astrology such a pervasive “scientific” presence in almost all the greatcultures of antiquity - Sumer, Egypt, Greece, the Vedic and Hindu, the Chinese,the Mayan, the Aztec, the Incan? Mainstream and even alternative scholars havelabored over this question for decades, and have come to essentially the sameconclusion: the ancients observed the motions of the heavens, were occasionallyvictims of some sort of celestial catastrophe, needed to know when to plant andharvest their crops, and so on, and felt awe and religious reverence for thesetremendous powers that clothed, fed, and sometimes destroyed them, and embodiedit all in the astrological lore we know today. De Santillana and Von Dechind’sclassic study Hamlet’s Mill is perhaps the prime example of this line ofthinking, but there are many, many others. One is left, in other words, with awell-footnoted reassertion of the old paradigm that the ancients were primitiveand superstitious peoples and that this sort of thing is just the sort of thingthat they did. The standard line is that one need not look further into thepossibility that their knowledge is a residue of an actual science left over,misunderstood - or understood as best as they could - by the cultures that werelegacies of an incomparably more sophisticated civilization. According to thatstandard school of interpretation, therefore, one must not take thosecivilizations’ own assertions that they are the legacies of that much older,much more ancient, and much more sophisticated culture at their word.But Budge presents information - tantalizing information - that something moremust have been going on. He notes that the Babylonian zodiac in use throughoutBabylon was “set up by Marduk” after his defeat of Tiamat, and that its signs“were different from the old ones, which he had disbanded...”446[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1142294] Indeed, Budge evenproduces the previous zodiac in use by Tiamat, Kingu and their associates priorto the war that destroyed her.447[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1142478] In other words, inaddition to the Enuma Elish’s statement that after the war and the explosion ofthe Planet Tiamat, Marduk “measured the structure of the deep,” there was alsothe introduction of a new zodiac, which is precisely a new “measure of thestructure of the deep.”So we may draw our first tentative answer, our first clue, to unraveling theenigma of what exactly the Tablets of Destinies were: They concerned“astrological” information, written or transcribed on “tablets.” But since weknow the consistent belief of astrology is that the positions and motions of thestars have subtle influences on life, emotions, and consciousness, we must addthat this information was somehow included in whatever the Tablets of Destinieswere.So far, so good."},{"pageContent":"1. THE ASTROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF CERTAIN STONES WITH CELESTIAL BODIES But there is more to this ancient astrological lore, according to Budge, thanthis, and here is where it begins to get very interesting. Most modern peopleonly encounter astrology, if they encounter it at all, in the “horoscope” pageof the local newspaper, or in little booklets of sun signs in the grocery storeaisle. Because of this type of exposure, most people think of astrology ashaving only to do with the subtle influences of the stars and planets on humanlife. But there is most decidedly more to the ancient view, as Budge observes:> The old astrologers believed that precious and semi-precious stones were> bearers of the influences of the Seven Astrological Stars or Planets. Thus> they associated with the-> SUN, yellowish or gold-coloured stones, e.g. amber, hyacinth, topaz,> chrysolite.> With the MOON, whitish stones, e.g. the diamond, crystal, opal, beryl,> mother-of-pearl.> With MARS, red stones, e.g. ruby, haematite, jasper, blood-stone.> With MERCURY, stones of neutral tints, e.g. agate, carnelian, chalcedony,> sardonyx.> With JUPITER, blue stones, e.g. amethyst, turquoise, sapphire, jasper, blue> diamond.> With VENUS, green stones, e.g. the emerald and some kinds of sapphires.> With SATURN, black stones, e.g. jet, onyx, obsidian, diamond, and black> coral.448 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1142633] But what is this, this new association of crystalline stones with the stars (theSun) and with planets? And more importantly, where did it come from? Why is itthere? Almost no one seems to know, but the implication of Budge’s remarks areclear: this too is a component of that astrological lore that dates back intothat tradition of “hundreds of thousands of years” of observation.It is, in other words, part of the “sciences of the ‘gods.’” Recall theassociation of similar stones with the war between Ninurta and Zu, his carefulinventory of Zu’s “stones” after his victory, his relegation of some of them todestruction, others to other uses, and some - a very few - which could not bedestroyed nor adapted, were simply secreted away in temples to be used in rites,and presumably never heard from again. Recall too the association of the “stoneof exile,” the “jewel” in Lucifer’s crown, which he lost when he fell. And ofcourse, recall the most obvious thing: the whole cosmic war in both its phases,the struggle between Tiamat and Marduk, the later struggle between Ninurta andZu, was a war for the possession and control of stones, of the “Tablets ofDestinies.”We now observe another obvious thing: Ninurta’s “Inventory of the Stones” asrecorded in the Lugal-E occurs when he has defeated Anzu, and since the wholewar was caused by the latter’s theft of the “Tablets of Destinies”, we concludethat Ninurta’s inventory was an inventory of the “stones” or components thatconstituted the Tablets of Destinies. We now have another clue to answering whatexactly these Tablets of Destinies were, and why they conferred such tremendouspowers to their possessors, power that, if one recalls our examination of thetexts in the two previous chapters, was an almost “universal” power, i.e.,conferred the power of the universe - of the stars and planets, and indeed thegalaxy (recalling the “galactic context” of De Santillana and Von Dechind) - ontheir possessors. In this respect, De Santillana and Von Dechind record a verypeculiar fact about Marduk’s war with Tiamat: two of the stars of theconstellation Scorpio were some of his weapons.449[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1142817]If one now recalls the association of particular types of “stones” with certaincelestial bodies that is a signal part of this ancient astrological lore, thenone might draw the conclusion that “stones” could be “weapons” when connectedwith such celestial bodies as Marduk’s “star weapons”. This conclusion seemswarranted by the very fact of Ninurta’s “Inventory of the Stones,” which, as wehave learned, was an inventory of the recovered components of the Tablets ofDestinies, which conferred “the power of the universe.”"},{"pageContent":"2. THE TABLETS OF DESTINIES JAM THE TALK OF THE GALAXY Anzu’s theft of the Tablets of Destinies from Enlil brought forth a most unusualcomplaint, which I cite here from the Old Babylonian version:> (Anzu) stole the Ellil-power; rites were abandoned,> Father Ellil their counselor was dumbstruck.> Radiance faded (?), silence reigned...450> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1143019] Zechariah Sitchin observes that “In Sumerian the name ZU meant ‘He Who Knows,’one expert in certain knowledge. Several references to the evil hero of thistale as AN.ZU - ‘He Who Knows the Heavens’ - suggest” for Sitchin a disruptionin communications between the gods on Earth and elsewhere in the universe.451[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1143227] Sitchin, of course,maintains that the theft of the Tablets shut down communications between a“spaceport” from which rockets maintained a steady traffic between Earth and thegods’ “homeworld,” Nibiru. While this is not the place to delve into theparticulars of Sitchin’s “paleophysical” interpretations, needless to say, I donot subscribe to this particular detail of Sitchin’s scenario for the simplereason that mere rockets would be a far too slow and inefficient method for anypractical travel between worlds.But his observation here is nonetheless an intriguing and important one for twocrucial reasons. The first is that (An)Zu’s actions give him the characteristicof a rebel and warrior, while his name gives him characteristics similar toEgypt’s wisdom-god, Thoth. The second important point about Sitchin’sobservation is that the theft of the Tablets of Destinies breaks downcommunications between Earth and “Elsewhere.”"},{"pageContent":"3. THOTH’S TABLETS ONCE AGAIN Ninurta’s “Inventory of the Stones” and the Tablets of Destinies, viewed in thistotal “astro-mythological context,” begins to sound peculiarly familiar, for itimplies that his “Inventory” was nothing less than a lithographic record of avast body of knowledge, encompassing celestial geometry, the properties ofcelestial bodies, and the mutual influences that existed between them andparticular stones. They are, in one sense, summaries of information.And in this respect, they begin to sound like the Tablets of another well-knownMiddle Eastern god, the Egyptian god of wisdom, Thoth. Here, I quote from pages58 - 62 of my book The Giza Death Star Destroyed once again, this time in orderto show the similarities between Thoth and Ninurta, and more importantly,between The Book of Thoth and Ninurta’s Tablets of Destinies:“A. THE ROLE OF HERMES-THOTH IN THE FOUNDING OF ESOTERICISM “Scattered throughout (Manly) Hall’s Secret Teachings of All Ages are numerousreferences to the enigmatic figure of Hermes-Thoth, and his crucial role in thepost-diluvian founding of esotericism. Aside from his identifications with Enochand other figures in various traditions,452[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1143421] the figure ofHermes-Thoth is ”of first importance to Masonic scholars, because he was theauthor of the Masonic initiatory rituals, which were borrowed from the Mysteriesestablished by Hermes.“453[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1143570] This connection ofHermes-Thoth with ante-diluvian knowledge and its survival in Masonic traditionsis made even more apparent by the identification of Thoth with the figure ofHiram Abiff, a figure who plays such a central role in the death-resurrectionrituals of the first three degrees of Masonry.454[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1143711] This traditionascribes the identification to the so-called Emerald Tablet of Thoth, aboutwhich we shall have more to say in a moment. More important for the subject ofesoteric continuity are the numerous references to the survival ofHermes-Thoth’s knowledge in the forms of books or inscribed tablets. In someversions, forty-two volumes of his works were removed from the Library ofAlexandria prior to its burning, and secreted with “initiates” who buried themin the desert for safekeeping.455[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1143861]“Returning now to the subject of the Emerald Tablet of Thoth, another strand ofesoteric tradition concerns the so-called Sacred Book of Thoth, a work we havereferred in the two previous Giza Death Star books.456[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1144010] Esoteric traditionhas it that while Thoth-Hermes ”still walked the earth with men, he entrusted tohis chosen successors the sacred Book of Thoth. This work contained the secretprocesses by which the regeneration of humanity was to be accomplished and alsoserved as the key to his other writings.“457[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1144191] The theme of thisbook was most likely the connection between the cosmos and man, a key mademanifest by the law of analogy:> The ancients believed that the theory of man’s being made in the image of God> was to be understood literally. They maintained that the universe was a great> organism not unlike the human body, and that every phase and function of the> Universal Body had a correspondence in man.458> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1144390] The most precious> Key to Wisdom that the priests communicated to the new initiates was what they> termed the law of analogy.“459> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1144622] Here I will interrupt my quotation of The Giza Death Star Destroyed to note thatone aspect of ancient belief was precisely the idea that that “subtleinfluences” and correspondences existed between the universe and the humanindividual, a variation on the astrological theme. Returning now to the extendedquotation from that book:“This principle (of analogy) formed the basis of my interpretation of ancientHermetic and Vedic texts in The Giza Death .Star460[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1145172] and ... is a centralmethodology informing the work of revisionist Egyptologist and scholar R. A.Schwaller De Lubicz.“In any case, not much is known about the alleged Book of Thoth other than thatits “pages” were apparently covered with hieroglyphics and other symbols thatallegedly gave its possessors ”unlimited power over the spirits of the air andsubterranean divinities’”461[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1145366]“That is to say, the Book of Thoth was, for the esoteric tradition, a book ofhigh magic. That it might have been a book of high science is possible, if oneunderstand the “spirits of the air and subterranean divinities” to mean theprinciples of celestial and terrestrial mechanics and physics. And once again I interrupt my quotation to observe that Thoth’s mysterious bookof “magic”, like the Mesopotamian “Tablets of Destinies” conferred a kind ofuniversal power to its possessor. Continuing now with the quotation: “But there is another significance to the Book of Thoth:> According to legend, the Book of Thoth was kept in a golden box in the inner> sanctuary of the temple. There was but one key and this was in the possession> of the “Master of the Mysteries,” the highest initiate of the Hermetic> Arcanum. He alone knew what was written in the secret book.

Similar traditions in Judaism record that the first giving of thetablets of the Law to Moses were also inscribed on sapphire. And in some cases,the Book of Thoth was said to be deposited in an “ark” like box. The Zoharrecords that God originally fashioned the tablets of the Law from a ”divinesapphire, Schethiya, which the Most High, after removing from His own throne,had cast into the Abyss to become the foundation and generator of theworlds.“463 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1145702] Thisrecalls the association of sapphire with the enigmatic properties of gravity,recorded in The Giza Death Star, for apparently this crystalline structure iscapable of detection of very small quantum gravitational fluctuations.464[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1145852]“But there is another association of sapphire in the esoteric tradition, and forour purposes, this association is quite significant. This is the “Stone ofExile” or Lapis Exilis, the “crown jewel of the Archangel Lucifer.”465[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1146047] This version of thelegend has it that the Archangel Michael struck the jewel from Lucifer’s crown,whence it fell into the Abyss. I then outlined a lengthy series of relationships, but highlight the two thatconcern us here, for they are signally important:> • “The tentative identification of the Sphinx with Lord Nergal, Babylonian god> of Mars, Fire, and War;> • ”The association of Giza, and in particular, the Great Pyramid, with> Hermes-Thoth;> • “The further association of Thoth with a tablet or book of lost knowledge of> physical mechanics of a comprehensive nature, inscribed on emerald or sapphire> • “The association of Lucifer with similar crystals;> • “The association of both Lucifer and Nergal with wars of rebellion;466> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1146216]> • “The interplanetary war between “Tiamat” and “Marduk” caused by Tiamat’s> possession, or usurpation, of the “Tablet” or “Stone(s) of Destiny”;> • “The missing resonator assemblies in the Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid,> which were, according to Sitchin’s reconstruction of the Babylonian epic> Lugal-e, of crystalline nature;> • “The association of this lost and crystalline Book of Thoth with the notion> of the continuity of the esoteric tradition. This way of viewing things tends to support the notion, so cherished inFreemasonry and other modern secret societies, that embedded within suchesoteric traditions is an occulted science, and that at least one element of thelost paleoancient Very High Civilization deliberately occulted such science forthe eventual resurrection and recovery of the technologies it made possible.“Thoth’s tablets are also associated with one more thing, and that isalchemy.467 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1146587] Alchemyis, of course, the “science” of the transmutation of “base elements” into“gold”. From the “paleophysics” perspective adopted here, this too might beunderstood as the residue of a real lost science dealing with the physics of a“hydro-dynamic” transmutative aether or physical substrate.“468[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1146756] Summing up what we have learned, we now have the following highly suggestivecatalogue of properties of the Tablets of Destinies: Clue Number 1:The Tablets of Destinies were “stones” or stone-like material, each of which wasassociated with some celestial body, and with some subtle influence betweenthose bodies and their possessors.We will call this the “Stones ≈ Celestial Body Association. ” This associationis evidenced by (1) Ninurta’s “Inventory of the Stone” of the Tablets of Destinyafter their recovery from Zu at the end of their war; and by (2) the longassociation of stones with celestial bodies in ancient astrological lore. Weposit, therefore, an underlying purely scientific and “paleophysical” basis forthese associations that, by the time of the classical Mesopotamiancivilizations, has declined to the interplanetary sympathetic magic ofastrological lore.This “Stones ≈ Celestial Body Association” is also related to the doctrine ofastrology that celestial bodies have a subtle influence on human lives, and thewhole ancient practice of sympathetic magic with its talismans and amulets is inindicator that a reciprocal influence is also possible, that the latter can alsoinfluence the former. Clue Number 2:The Tablets of Destinies also contained information on the underlying physicalmedium or substrate itself, and how to manipulate it, presumably in connectionto the “Stones ≈ Celestial Bodies Association” of clue number one above. Theyconfer the power of the universe to their possessors.Both Thoth’s Book of Magic and/or his celebrated Emerald Tablet, and theMesopotamian Tablets of Destinies are also associated with the idea that theyconvey “universal power” to their possessors. That is, they convey power overthe universe by conveying the power of the universe to their possessors. In thecase of Thoth’s Tablets we saw that their strong alchemical association might beinterpreted as the residue of a long lost science of the power of thetransmutative aether, or physical medium or substrate itself. The Tablets are,then, a kind of physical version of the Akashic Records of esoteric lore, sincethe Tablets appear to record how to effect the information content in the fieldof that medium or substrate.We shall call this the “Transmutative Medium ≈ Akashic Records ≈ Universal PowerAssociation. ” Clue Number 3:Per Sitchin, the Tablets of Destinies were involved in interplanetary andinterstellar communication of some sort.Their theft by Anzu therefore not only conferred to him tremendous power, butalso cut off or interferred with the communications of his opponents. We shallcall this the “Commmmications Association. ” And finally, Clue Number 4:The Tablets of Destinies appear to have been “activated” only in physicalproximity to their possessors.This point is related to the alchemical connection of Thoth’s Tablets, and tothe general ancient doctrine that the Universe was somehow a “makanthropos,” alarge scale version of mankind. Thus, there were subtle influences between thegods, mankind, and even between individuals, and the celestial bodies of theuniverse. This is further born out by curious statement from the Myth of (An)Zuthat Ninurta “regained the gods’ Tablet of Destinies for his own hand.”469[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1146990] The Tablets may thushave contained the original actual science behind the ancient doctrine of man as“makanthropos”470 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1147172] aswell as that behind the ancient belief in the celestial influences of astrology.We shall call this most mysterious and enigmatic property of the Tablets ofDestinies the “Subtle Influences Association. ” A table will perhaps best summarize what is known of them from the mythologicalside, and what the evidence is for each point: Table of Tablets of Destinies Associations033 [images/00033.jpg] This table of the “Clues” and their supporting associations indicates both whyso many interpreters - who do sense some underlying “paleophysical” andtechnological basis for the Tablets of Destinies - come up with such a widevariety of explanations, for viewing only one or two of the Associations, theanswer will be incomplete. It is only in the total context of all four “Clues”or “Associations” viewed against the background of the points in our summariesin this chapter, that a more thorough — though still speculative — answer may beobtained, as we shall now see."},{"pageContent":"C. THE QUANTUM POTENTIAL OR SCALAR PHYSICS BASIS OF THE FOUR ASSOCIATIONS OF THETABLETS OF DESTINIES The careful reader will have noticed that each of the four associations or cluesof what the Tablets of Destinies were has an exact analogue in the variousphysical theories and phenomena surveyed in part one.

THE PHYSICS OF THE “STONES ≈ CELESTIAL BODY” ASSOCIATION: PAUL LAVIOLETTE’SSTARS AS GALACTIC COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES At the risk of being redundant, let us now recall verbatim from chapter fivewhat scientist Paul LaViolette wrote about the possibility that pulsars couldbe, or have been, used in a vast galactic system of interstellar communicationwith a physical frame of reference centered upon our own solar system.LaViolette’s series of crucial observations, as we noted there, would become“signally important in answering one of the most enduring questions of mythologyfrom a paleophysical point of view,” and the question to be answered was “Whatexactly are the Tablets of Destinies”? LaViolette wrote> Optical phase conjugation is most commonly known for its use in military laser> weapons systems for destroying enemy missiles.

At this juncture, having refreshed the reader’s memory with LaViolette’s “pulsarcommunicator system” and its interstellar, lethal potentialities, it is alsoworthwhile to recall that stars formed one weapons system in Marduk’s arsenal,as De Santillana and Von Dechind observed.Let us also recall, at the risk if being redundant once again, the exactcomponents that LaViolette envisioned for this vast interstellar communicationsand weapons system:> ...suppose that a bank of high-voltage capacitors are suddenly discharged to> momentarily create a powerful air ionizing arc, or regularly shaped plasmoid.> Also, suppose that a beam of coherent microwave radiation from a maser is> targeted on this plasmoid. This beam would be sent out by a phase conjugating> device something like that pictured... This device splits the original maser> beam into two beams, a probe beam and a pump beam. The probe beam is directed> toward the plasma target, and some of its scattered microwaves shine back> toward the phase conjugator device and enter its mixer chamber. The mixer> chamber if filled with a medium that has very nonlinear electromagnetic> properties. Meanwhile, the pump beam that is split off from the maser> generator is directed to the adjoining mixer chamber where it passes through> the nonlinear mixer medium, reflects from a wall at the far end, makes a> second pass back through the mixer medium, and then reenters the maser> generator compartment.> The microwaves that scatter from the plasmoid and enter the mixer medium> strongly interact with the two pump maser beams to form an electrostatic> grating pattern. This holographic pattern stores information about the> directions and phases of all the scattered maser beam microwaves that have> entered the mixer. The counterpropagating pump beams then reflect from this> grating pattern to produce an outgoing microwave beam that precisely traces> the paths followed by the incoming scattered waves... the randomizing effects> of wave scattering having been automatically compensated for. ...The grating> that performs this time-reversed reflection is called a phase conjugate mirror> and the mixing arrangement that allows all this to happen is termed a four> wave mixer. .....This closed loop path from the maser beam generator, to the> plasmoid, to the mixer, to the plasmoid, and back to the maser beam generator,> causes the maser system to function as a phase conjugate resonator and to> preferentially select and amplify only those microwaves that target the phase> conjugating mixer chamber. As a result, most of the microwave power emitted> from the maser will end up being confined to a beam that extends between the> maser beam generator, the plasmoid target, and the mixer chamber. The energy> bottled up in this beam will then progressively build up to a very high> value.474 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1148385] Thus, we may now see what possibly comprises one element of what the Tablets ofDestinies were; they were a catalogue of the grating or interference patterns ofvarious celestial bodies for a phase conjugate mirror of great sophistication.They were, to recall Bearden’s remarks from chapter two, the templates of actionfor those mirrors."},{"pageContent":"3. THE PHYSICS OF THE “TRANSMUTATIVE AETHER ≈ UNIVERSAL POWER ≈ AKASHIC FIELD”ASSOCIATION: Bearden’s “Mark IV” Scalar Version of LaViolette’s Galactic Communicators, andLaszlo’s Akashic Field As has been seen, La Violette’s speculations involve only standardelectromagnetic phase conjugation, even though he himself proposes a microwave,“Mark II” version of normal “Mark I” optical phase conjugation.475[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1148598] As I then observedin chapter five, this would seem to open up the possibility for a “Mark III”version of electromagnetic phase conjugation based on X-rays and on evendeadlier gamma rays. Of course, there are engineering problems galore with sucha notion. In my book The SS Brotherhood of the Bell I noted that one problemscientists faced, who were involved in the Pentagon’s so-called - and in thecontext of this book - aptly named “Star Wars” program, was how to cohere gammarays like an optical laser beam. How would one construct the “optical” or“lasing cavity” for a gamma ray laser, or graser, since no known means seemed tobe available to do it until the stressing-and-cohering properties of theMossbauer Effect were discovered. This effect essentially means that aradioactive and gamma emitting source such as cobalt, under certain conditionsof acoustic resonance and stress, can be induced or stimulated to emit beams ofcoherent gamma rays.476[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1151759]A similar problem would be faced in constructing a beam-splitter for a gamma-raybased phase conjugate mirror, since no method is yet known how to split agraser-beam, much less to mix them to construct a “grating” through which themain graser beam would be pumped.But once one recalls what Bearden’s scalar physics actually is - and as was seenin chapter five LaViolette is specifically aware of Bearden’s work and itspotential - then one would have to posit a “Mark IV” version of a phaseconjugate mirror, one based on recording the gratings of the interferedlongitudinal waves in the medium itself. This version, like all other properlyconfigured “Marks” in our series of phase conjugate mirrors, would be capable ofaction at a great distance without the constraints of the “relativistic speedlimit” of the velocity of light.In this context, The Tablets with their catalogue of interference patterns oflongitudinal waves within the medium would constitute an object conferring akind of universal power. Such a catalogue, with the medium acting as a kind of“akashic field” that, in the words of philosopher and scientist Ervin Laszlo,carries information “by super-imposed vacuum wave-interference patterns that areequivalent to holograms,”477[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1151950] would be an objectconferring almost godlike powers for communications over vast distances, andalmost godlike powers of destruction. And it should be noted that both uses aremodes of deployment of the same technology.Laszlo’s reference to holograms in this context of action at a distance throughwhat is essentially the non-local phenomenon of the medium throws light on thebasic technique that would be used in such a Mark IV phase conjugate mirror. Itis a technique already well-known and empirically demonstrated in thelaboratory:> First two charged atoms (ions), labeled A and B, are “entangled,” creating the> instance link....Then a third atom, labeled P, is prepared by encoding in it> the coherently superposed quantum state that is to be teleported. Then A, one> of the entangled ions, is measured together with the prepared atom P. At that> point the internal quantum state of B transforms: it assumes the exact state> that was encoded in P! ...When A and P are measured together, the preexisting> nonlocal connection between A and B creates a nonlocal transfer of state from> P to B.478 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1152145]Magnified to a universal scale, this means that “the quantum vacuum generatesthe holographic field that is the memory of the universe.”479[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1152298]Such nonlocal transference of quantum states, it is now known, can be greatlyextended to whole interference patterns of torsion waves:> A particularly promising theory is the work of the Russian physicists G.L.> Shipov, A.E. Akimov, and coworkers, further elaborated by scientists in> America as well as Europe. Their “torsion-wave” theory shows how the vacuum> can link physical events throughout space-time.

The> information carried by a given vortex corresponds to the magnetic momentum of> the particle that created it: it is information on the state of that particle.> These minute spinning structures travel through the vacuum, and they interact> with each other. When two or more of these torsion waves meet, they form an> interference pattern that integrates the strands of information on the> particles that created them.

Throughout the universe, particles are> linked by the vacuum in much the same way as objects are linked in the sea: by> making and receiving waves. 481> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1152657] The medium, therefore, carries universal information, namely, the information ofthe universe. It is worth citing Laszlo at length once again, for his insightsbear directly on the Association of “Transmutative Aether ≈ Universal Power ≈Akashic Field”:> Although much remains to be discovered about the quantum vacuum, it is already> clear that it is a superdense cosmic medium. It carries light, and all the> universal forces of nature. Pressure waves may propagate through it.... This> is the finding of the German mathematical physicist Hartmut Mueller,482> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1152865] who claims that> the observed dimensions of all entities, from atoms to galaxies, is determined> by interaction with density-pressure waves propagating in the vacuum.483> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1153139] Consequently, “all the information that constitutes the universe is stored onits periphery, which is a two-dimensional surface.”484[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1153327] Thus, the Tablets ofDestinies are a catalogue of a certain limited set of this holographicinformation. Like all holograms, they are a grating or interference pattern,whose information is only revealed by shining a cohered energy beam of thefrequency that created them through the grating. And we saw previously that theTablets were also associated with ME-LAMs, with “light emitting crystals.”Thus, we may now see what comprises yet another element of what the Tablets ofDestinies were; they were not only a catalogue of the grating or interferencepatterns of various celestial bodies for a phase conjugate mirror of greatsophistication, but - since they are based on such interference waves in themedium itself - they are also a catalogue of those types of waves, giving theirpossessor limited access to the “memory of the universe” (to borrow Laszlo’sphrase), or to the “information content of the field” of the universe, and assuch, conveying to their possessors both “universal” powers and the powers of“the universe.” In this sense, the “destinies” component of the term “Tablets ofDestinies” is not so far from what actually may have been the case, signifyingobjects able to manipulate the local space and time, the “destinies”, of objectsthemselves.There is one more implication of this component of the Tablets of Destinies thatshould be noticed, though extensive comment will have to be reserved to a laterpoint in this chapter: Because such an interferometric grating of waves in themedium itself would give the Tablets’ possessor access to the “memory” of atleast a large part of the galactic universe, it stands to reason that part ofthat “memory” comprises the memory, and therefore, the character and intention,of its possessors. Or to put it in a scalar physicist’s terms, the memory,character, and intention of the possessor of the Tablets of Destinies functionslike a local structured potential, and impresses these dynamics of theirpossessor upon the Tablets. These impressed dynamics become part of thecatalogue of “gratings” that comprise the Tablets."},{"pageContent":"3. THE PHYSICS OF THE “COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION”: BEARDEN’S SCALAR PHYSICS ANDCOMMUNICATIONS VIA LONGITUDINAL WAVES IN THE MEDIUM, LAVIOLETTE’S GRATING, AND AFEARSOME INTERFACE As scientist Paul LaViolette noted earlier, and as has been noted with the abovequotations from Ervin Laszlo, scalar, longitudinal pressure waves - what I haverepeatedly called “electro-acoustic” waves - in the medium might be the mosteffective way of communication over vast interstellar distances, since it wouldnot be limited by the relativistic speed limit of the velocity of light. And asI noted above, there is a definite and important role of the conscious observerboth in influencing, and in being influenced by, the “grating” of theinterference of such waves.Many commentators and physicists have observed that the phenomenon of CoordinateRemote Viewing seems to access this “information content of the field” ormedium. One may therefore speculate that the Tablets of Destinies are not onlycatalogues of gratings in the senses of the two previous associations, butpossibly also a mechanism or interface that would enhance such phenomena ascoordinate remote viewing, or, as will be seen toward the end of this chapter,“channeling”.Thus, we may now see what comprises yet another element of what the Tablets ofDestinies were; they were not only a catalogue of the grating or interferencepatterns of various celestial bodies for a phase conjugate mirror of greatsophistication. They are not only a catalogue of those types of waves, givingtheir possessor limited access to the “memory of the universe” (to borrowLaszlo’s phrase), or to the “information content of the field” of the universe,and as such, conveying to their possessors “universal” powers and the powers of“the universe.” They are also the “gratings” necessary to send information, tocommunicate over vast distances free of the constraints of the relativisticspeed limit of light. And as also noted, the Tablets of Destinies are alsoperhaps a technology of interface between consciousness and the gratingsthemselves.Laszlo’s remarks concerning the “holographic” nature of these phenomena, plusthe implication that consciousness can impress its emotional, character, andintentional dynamics on these gratings and in turn be impressed by them, leadsus finally to..."},{"pageContent":"4.... THE PHYSICS OF THE “SUBTLE INFLUENCE ASSOCIATION ”: BEARDEN ON THE LOCALSTRUCTURED POTENTIAL AND PSYCHOENERGETICS One aspect of scalar or quantum potential physics that Lt. Col. Tom Beardenspends a great deal of time on is the ability of his “templates” or “causalsystem robots” - which we have been calling “gratings” - to effect the inductionof disease or, conversely, healing at a distance, by inducing the structuredpotential or “grating” or electromagnetic signature of particular diseases at adistance.485 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1153476]But beyond the ability to effect states of disease or health in biologicalorganisms, there is also a component, an implication, of this science ofimpressed dynamics and templates that is nothing less than chilling. It is bestto cite Bearden’s own trenchant and succinct warning in this regard:> • When God created life and living systems He also created the process for> making life and a living biological system.> • The process is still there and it exists as a process in and of this> 4-spatial world.> • Once the process is discovered and modeled, technology can be developed to> apply the process at will.> • So scientists can scientifically study the process and develop the> technology to use it.> • (Scientists can thus) make a living mind and living biological system, and> tailor it to form and whatever behavior is desired.> • That superweapon science is called psychoenergetics486> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1153686] Note then, that one implication of the “grating” or template is the ability toinfluence emotions, character, and behavior at a distance by constructing a“grating” or template, through which a beam is sent.A. IMPRESSED EMOTIONAL DYNAMICS: THE TABLETS OF DESTINIES AND THE SPREAD OF THE“VIRUS” OF EVIL As these thoughts aver, it is possible to impress certain character, emotional,and intentional dynamics on these gratings, and vice versa, it is possible, asthe quotation from Bearden avers, for these gratings to induce, via“electro-acoustic” means, states of character, emotion, and behavior.At this juncture it is crucial for the reader to recall what happened to thepossessors of the Tablets of Destinies after their initial theft by Tiamat. FromTiamat, to Marduk, who recovered them from her, to Enlil, to Anzu, toNinurta...each of their possessors engaged in horrific acts of warfare andwholesale destruction and slaughter. It is as if the evil acts and/or intentionsof their initial possessor impressed itself on the Tablets, and in the case oftheir later possessors, that this latent impressed dynamic in turn may haveinfluenced them.So in addition to all the foregoing, the Tablets of Destinies may also be acatalogue of the templates of the impressed dynamics of consciousness of certainindividuals. They are, so to speak, not a “virus” of evil, but what producesthat virus.B. A RETURN TO THE EDFU TEXTS With these thoughts in mind, let us return to the Edfu texts and note somepeculiar features. E.A.E. Reymond says that shortly after the creation of thePrimeval mound was “connected also with uttering of names.” But these names are“names either of one or of several sacred places which were created” on thePrimeval Mound.487 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1154152]We saw in chapter seven how the process of creation in the Edfu texts is alsoconnected with the recitation of “spells” over objects that represented thespecial places to be created. The presence of such objects in connection withsound and the process of creation, and now the evident use of “names” to denotespecific locations, strongly suggests the type of scalar physics I believe to beoperative in the Tablets of Destinies is also operative here in the Edfu texts.The parallels are quite remarkable. Indeed, Reymond states that the Edfu textsmention a “Sacred Book of the Temples. ”It is certain that this book did notcontain regulations of the temple ritual services or descriptions of thestructural development of the Edfu Temple. The part of this document preservedat Edfu reveals that it included lists of names of mythical shrines and sacredplaces; each name listed is accompanied with a brief explanation of themythological significance implicit in that particular name.“488[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1154371] In other words, the“Sound Eye” to which the Edfu texts refer may be one and the same as thetechnologies the Edfu texts recount elsewhere in relation to the creation of theprimeval mound itself. The technology described corresponds with the basiccomponents of scalar technology and weapons to a remarkable, and in my opinion,non-coincidental degree. In this case, the “naming” of places would correspondto the specific “gratings” for each location.This conclusion is supported by an extensive comment Reymond makes elsewhere,and which we previously cited in chapter seven:> We attempted to explain in one of our previous studies the significance of the> action described as ... to endure with power the substances of the Earth. It> appeared as though this... action had the aspect of a symbolic and magical> rite of creation. The main part of that rite consisted of uttering sacred> spells by the creators over certain (objects) which, we may say, might have> been believed to symbolize the Earth to be created. We suspect that by virtue> of this rite it was believed that the symbols of the Earth were filled with> special power. This power then caused the Earth to emerge in the form of> specific plots of earth along and around the edges of the island. This process> of creation of the Earth by the word of the creators has no equivalent. Such a> manner of creation can be compared with the Hermopolitan conception of the> creation of the world; according to the latter, the Earth was believed to have> been created by drying up the primaeval waters that surrounded the island.> Both of these ways of creating, the magical process as well as the procedure> by the solar radiance, had the same result, they seem to have made manifest> what was created previously by the nameless powers, but was hidden beneath the> primaeval waters.489> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1154595] As I observed in chapter seven, this gives us the following elements:> 1. The Edfu accounts, by maintaining a creation by the utterance of “magic> spells” is paralleling yet another famous account of a similar concept of> creation, that of Genesis 1. Both maintain that sound is somehow involved;> 2. These “spells” were, however, unlike the Genesis account, uttered over> certain objects which then created the various “earths” desired;> 3. If one adds in the Hermopolitan tradition, the use of (solar) radiation or> energy is also a component. So we have:> 1. Sound> 2. Objects> 3. Energy, or radiation. But now we also have a “book” describing the names of specific places, in otherwords, along with the above three items, the “book” of “sacred place names”constitutes the final essential element in this scalar technology. It isanalogous to the “templates” or gratings discussed previously in respect to theTablets of Destinies. In short, the Edfu texts indicate a similar if notidentical technology that was associated with the “creation” and the subsequentconflict, and that these very same technologies describe the mythical “SoundEye” that wrought such destruction during that conflict. It would thus appearthat both the Mesopotamian “Tablets of Destinies” and the Edfu “Sound Eye” aretwo traditions that reflect a common and remote technological ancestor.C. A SUMMARY We are now in a position to summarize the whole conceptual complex withinmythology that surrounds the Tablets of Destinies by adding to our familiarformula. Here, however, we make one significant modification to it based on thefindings of this chapter; here we replace the term “Planets” in the formula,with the term “Celestial Bodies:”> “Mountains” ≈ “Celestial Bodies” ≈ “Pyramids” ≈ “Tablets” As before, I define the symbol ≈ to mean “are closely associated, but notidentical, with.”All the above relationships are summarized in the following table on the nextpage. Table of Associations of the Tablets of Destinies034 [images/00034.jpg] We now have a rational basis upon which to speculate what the Tablets ofDestinies were:Grounded both in the ancient texts and a modern physics interpretation of them,the Tablets of Destinies were most likely crystals of some sort through whichlight or other electromagnetic energy was beamed, and these crystals containedinformation. This information was the “holographic” interferometric “grating” or“interference pattern”, Bearden’s quantum potential “template of action,” thescalar signatures, of almost every celestial body considered important in, to,and by the civilization of the “gods.” These priceless catalogues were,moreover, compiled relative to our own solar system as their physical frame ofreference. Additionally, they included within their catalogue of “gratings” or“templates” the “subtle influences” — as an impressed dynamic — ofconsciousness.490 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1154748]They most likely worked best, therefore, when interfaced — by means now lost andunknown to us — with an intelligent and conscious user. This catalogue ofinterferometric gratings, based on longitudinal waves in the medium, was thusthe central component of any communications system that held together their vastand interstellar empire, since only the gratings themselves allowed one toselect the system with which one wished to communicate. Similarly, theseinterferometric gratings were the central components in any weapon systemdesigned to target celestial bodies from a great distance. Finally, thecatalogue which was the Tablets of Destinies also likely included numerousgratings or templates of emotional states, which could also be impressed intotargets from a great distance.If this speculative hypothesis concerning the Tablets of Destinies is true, thenit constitutes an explanation that explains why their theft at various times> • Broke down communications between the solar system and other parts of their> empire;> • Caused the “gods’” extreme concern that they would no longer be able to rule> because of their lack of ability to continue to manipulate their subjects> mentally and emotionally;> • Conferred hegemony to whomever possessed them not only for the above> reasons, but because they allowed the targeting of scalar weapons of mass> destruction at great distance. In short, The Tablets of Destinies were the “software”491[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1155216] gratings of phaseonjugate mirrors for almost every celestial body that was considered importantto them, that held their empire together, and made their scalar- and“electro-acoustic”- based communications and weapons systems work.As has been outlined here, one aspect of this paleophysics involvesconsciousness and mind manipulation by means of impressed electrodynamics ontargeted biological systems and intelligent life. This is, perhaps, an enduringlegacy of the war, for if as I have argued in the Giza Death Star trilogy, theGreat Pyramid was a component in some ancient scalar weapons system of vastpower, then its shell still stands at Giza, perhaps maintaining some partialfunctioning of this nature.While it is highly speculative, it is nonetheless worth pointing out here thatthere might be a technology - a very ancient technology - that lies behind thephenomena of “channeled messages from ‘extraterrestrials’” and so on that havebeen with humanity throughout most of its history, down to, and including themodern obsession with them and with their dubious messages of coming “peace andenlightenment.” One researcher, with whom the present author has been privilegedto share a stage during conferences, and whom the present author highlyrespects, seriously suggested that if the Great Pyramid was a weapon, thenperhaps its usage was entirely benign, being one of beaming feelings of love,harmony, and peace, and thus preventing wars. Beyond the moral questions thisraises about the interference with the individual will, it begs the obviousquestion of why that particular region seems throughout its history to be thehome not only of “revelations” but of rivers of blood spilt in countless wars.Far from supporting such a contention, the bloody barrenness of the region wouldseem to argue against my friend’s speculation. Indeed, his speculation would notseem to be the best way of dodging the bullet that there might be a malignaspect and influence at work, one attested to time and again in the texts fromthat part of the world.In this connection it is interesting to note that Thorkild Jacobsen’stranslation of the Lugal-e refers to some of the stones as warriors, a themethat was clearly recognizable in the previous chapter, in Dalley’s translationsof the same epic:> The Basalt, the Diorite, the Dolerite,> the “Duck”-stone, the Haematite,> and the warrior Alabaster, its warriors> constantly come raiding the cities,> for them a monster’s tooth has grown up...492> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1156152] While the “monster’s tooth” could be a reference to a pyramid, a little furtheron the text states that “daily the Azag is turning the border (district) over toits side!”493 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1156342] Thesereferences suggest that the Tablets were being used to manipulate the emotionsof whole populations to take up arms in the revolt, and tend to confirm ourhypothesis that consciousness was a primary component of the manipulation bothof the Tablets by their possessors, and in turn of individuals by the Tablets.So what happened to the Tablets of Destinies? As we already know, some of theircomponents were destroyed by Ninurta. Others, as we also know, were adapted toother use, and some, which could not be destroyed, were, like Thoth’s emeraldtablets, secreted away. The truly sobering reality is not only what the Tabletsof Destinies were, but that some of them, the most malign components in fact,may still exist.A clue perhaps, if afforded by Marduk’s own admission in the Erra/Nergal andIshum text that he “changed the location of the mesu-tree (and of) theelmesu-stone, and did not reveal it to anyone.”494[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1156515] If, as seems likely,these objects were components of the Tablets, then it would appear that some ofthem were deliberately hidden by Marduk long before their subsequent theft fromEnlil by (An)Zu. A little later on in the same story, it appears that Nergalconvinced Marduk to reveal to him the location of these objects:> He made his voice heard and spoke to prince Marduk> 035 [images/00035.jpg]> 495 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1156697] The gap in thetext suggests that this is what Nergal was up to, for a short while later,Nergal reveals his intentions to Marduk, who approves of his plan:> I shall make Anu and Ellil lie down like bulls, to right and left> of your gate.”> Prince Marduk listened to him,> And the speech that Erra (Nergal) made was pleasing to him.496> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1156847] This gives us not only some insight into the genocidal characters of Nergal andMarduk, but a clue as to the possible whereabouts today of these missingcomponents of the Tablets of Destinies.Careful consideration of the details of this and the previous chapter willreveal that their possible locations are tied to a very few locations, farbeneath the sands and rock of the deserts of Mesopotamia and Egypt: Giza,Babylon and Nimrud or Nippur - site of Ninurta’s temple - in Iraq,497[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1156997] and possibly Baalbekin Lebanon. But as we shall also discover, there is a certain body of evidencethat suggests that some of them also made their way... elsewhere.But whatever their location, the texts and legends associated with them, fromThoth’s Emerald Tablets to Ninurta’s missing stones of power, all indicate thatsomething of the original Tablets of Destiny survived."},{"pageContent":"10.

INTRODUCTORY PEMARKS There are, according to alternative researcher Bruce Rux, essentially three waysto view the similarities in ancient myths from around the world:> One, each myth cycle is indigenous to a given people, beginning with features> unique to them that then become influenced by invaders or assimilated tribes;> two, myths are all psychological projections (called by Jung “archetypes”) of> man’s innermost psyche, showing the universality of the human soul; or, three,> they are all the same myth from great antiquity, becoming individually> corrupted in various ways over the ensuing centuries. The first two theories> are the prevailing ones today, being the anthropological and psychological> schools of thought. The latter is generally dismissed without much> consideration, since it brings to mind Atlantis (and other seemingly fabulous> theories), which has become excluded from the accepted canon of theories> though there is a tremendous amount of evidence to suggest it once existed.499> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1157441] How else would one explain, for example, the myth among the Omaha Indians ofNorth America of the burning cedar tree which was not consumed, and from whichthe animals had worn four trails, each of which led in one of the four cardinalcompass points?500 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1157591]The similarity to Moses’ theophany at the burning bush in Sinai is at least asremarkable as the differences between the two accounts.And this “similar-dissimilar” pattern is one that can be encountered time andagain when one examines the myths of the world. It is not the fact that thereare such similarities that is so arresting, it is rather their sheer quantity,and the extent to which these similarities extend to details. But equallyarresting are the dissimilarities. All too often one encounters in parallelmyths not only the same details, but new ones, at times seemingly contradictoryto what is assumed to be the “original” story.So one must modify Rux’s “third alternative” method of explaining thecommonalities of ancient myths to include the possibility that not all detailsof a mythological “archetype” will be included in any given culture’s retellingof a particular myth. Details might be missing in one account that might bepreserved in another. And this makes any task of reconstructing the “original”myth that much more difficult. It is like trying to assemble a massivefour-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, matching the edges of motifs from one accountwith those of another. The situation is rendered all the more complex given thatso many of these myths evidence the same kind of “sacred punning” andmulti-tiered layers of meaning that we have called the “Unified Intention ofSymbol” in our encounters with the rich mythological traditions of Egypt andMesopotamia. The details preserved in one account might be found in a completelydifferent context in another account, and thus, one or the other, or both, mightbe garbled versions of the “original.” On any account, if the pursuit of thefirst two alternatives mentioned by Rux be viewed as a kind of “mythologicalliberalism” or Jungian “deconstruction,” then by the same token the thirdalternative is a kind of “mythological higher criticism” seeking to recover thelost originals from textual clues and external evidences.But clues nonetheless there are, and ignoring them by the standard academicanesthetic of deconstruction, Jungian or otherwise, will not make them go away.They are still there, a throbbing and nagging symptom in our perceptions thatthe anesthetic has only dulled but not eradicated. It is time then to allow theanesthetic to wear off and die of its own dead weight, and confront the headachehead-on.Perhaps the most painful aspect of this mythological migraine is the persistent,and detailed association of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Mars. In The Giza Death StarDestroyed I speculated on a connection between the Red Planet and the Gizaplateau by way of the curious correspondences that exist between theMesopotamian god Nergal - god of Mars, fire, rebellion, and war - and the wholeconcept of a chimerical creature such as the Sphinx.501[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1157741] But there are many,many more such peculiar connections..."},{"pageContent":"B. MES, MERS, AND MARS Bruce Rux, to whom we have already referred, points out that the word “mer”,meaning “place of ascension” is one term that ancient Egyptians gave to theirpyramids, a meaning associating them, once again, with the heavens.502[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1157930] The same, Rux notes,can also be said of the Sumerian MEs, or power objects. But Rux adds one ofthose “details” referred to earlier. “The Sumerian Enoch’s name, ‘Enmeduranki,’”contains the root DUR-AN-KI, which as noted previously, means the “bondheaven-earth,”, and thus the Sumerian Enoch’s name “meant ‘Ruler whose Meconnects Heaven and Earth.’”503[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1158121] But this is not all.There are peculiar, and detailed, connections to the Red Planet, to Mars, and tothe god of war who rules it. To see how, one must journey away from Mesopotamiaand Egypt, out across the Atlantic, to North and South America and to some veryintriguing native American Indian traditions."},{"pageContent":"1. NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN CONNECTIONS One tale that concerns us is that of the Chiapas Indians of Guatemala, whoselanguage, notes Rux, “has always confused scholars because of its strongresemblance to Hebrew.”504[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1158271] The Chiapas had alegend> about an exiled king come came to stay with them, a white man-god who lived> among them, traveling frequently, teaching them civilization and all their> knowledge. His name was “Votan,” and his people were called the Chivim,> “Serpents.” Not only is the name quite obviously the same as that of “Wotan”> (which, in the German tongue, would be exactly pronounced “Votan”) and “Odin,”> but it also cannot help but call to mind the great god of the American Indian> Creation epic, the Chon-oopa-sa, named “Wo-kon.” Votan told them the story of> the Tower of Babel, as “a great city where a magnificent temple was under> construction which was intended to reach to heaven, but was doomed by a> confusion of languages. ” He was associated with snakes, and with healing.> Before his departure, he wrote a book in the Quiche language describing his> travels and hidden treasures, which was burned by Bishop Nunez de la Vega in> 1691.505 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1158421] More will be said about the connection of this “civilizing god” with snakes at asubsequent point. Here what must command one’s attention is the fact that theGuatemalan version of the story is almost identical with that of the biblical,and yet no explanation exists for it! It is, nonetheless, there.Consider the magnitude of the problem that this presents. On the standard theoryof Indian migration from Asia to North America via a land bridge some tens ofthousands of years ago, prior to all physical connection between the two greatworld islands being lost, the story could not possibly have come by this route,unless one posits that it took place much earlier than standard biblicalhistories will allow, or that communication between the two world islands wasmaintained by a high seafaring culture, which standard theory likewisediscountenances to some extent, in spite of some considerable evidence that suchwas precisely the case.The Tower of Babel, however, is not the only such case to be explained. InAustralia, aboriginal peoples recount a legend of a sun god who comes down fromheaven, and conquers the earth with “intense heat after a mighty and terrifyingconflict.”506 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1158622] Thisreference to a sun god, to a kind of heat-based weapon, and to an obvious war,resonates with the Egyptian sun-god Ra, and with his “eye” weapon, as we shallsee in a moment. But how would Egyptian and Australian aboriginals recountalmost the same war, in the same terms? “Jungian archetypes” might be able toexplain the coincidences of “war legends” across various cultures, but it seemsto stretch their explanatory power to assume that they explain the detailedsimilarities in weapons used and in the personages involved in wielding them."},{"pageContent":"2. MORE CONNECTIONS: GIANTS, THE RED-PAINT PEOPLE, AND THE ASTRONOMICAL WEST Egyptian, Irish-Celtic, and Gallic-Celtic legends refer to an enigmatic “Land ofthe West” which may well refer to the two American continents. The variousCeltic and Germanic traditions also refer - as we saw in chapter three - toraces of warlike giants, and even the Cherokee nation of North America refers tothe Tsunilkalu, a “slant-eyed” race of giants” from a land in the west, andclassical Greek references exist quoting Gallic stories about a “Hyperborean”land in the west which was invaded by warring giants from the Western Ocean.507[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1158772]Another peculiar connection exists between the “New” world and the “Old” worldof ancient Egypt: the “Red Paint People.” The Mayan god Pacal was depicted as awhite man of - for then - large stature, “whose teeth were discovered to bepainted bright red.”508[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1158962] It is this samefigure of Pacal on his famous “sarcophagus” in Palenque, that many revisionistsof the “ancient astronauts” school, beginning with Erich von Däniken in hisfamous Chariots of the Gods, take to be a stylized portrayal of an astronaut ina space capsule.036 [images/00036.jpg] Lord Pacal of PalenqueWhile many revisionists see in Pacal’s sarcophagus a corroboration of their“ancient astronauts” theory and are quick to dismiss its mythologicalconnections, there really is no reason to oppose the mythological elements ofthe sarcophagus lid from what are also very suggestive elements of stylizedtechnology and transportation.Why this is so may be seen from the fact that, as author and alternativeresearcher David Hatcher Childress observes, the “sacred bird, sun and moonmotifs” that appear to the left of the picture “signify the upper world, whilethe monster below signifies the under world. The ancient Chinese had the exactsame belief in three interlocking worlds.”509[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1159112] Indeed, the theme ofthe three interlocking worlds is a common one in most mythological traditions.But Pacal, as was seen, is an example of the “Red Paint People,” and it is thisconnection which, with its own network of concepts, traces to Egypt, and to thepossibility that, in Pacal’s case, the “ancient astronaut” and the“mythological” elements need not necessarily be opposed, but rather, aid in eachother’s complete understanding. As Rux observes,> The Red Paint People were written of around the turn of the (last) century by> such notable scholars as Lewis Spence in The History of Atlantis, and then> appear to have been ignored until such anthropologists as Richard Cavendish> and Franklin and Mary Folsom brought them up again.... Also known as the> “Maritime Archaic” culture circa 5,500-2,000 BC, they were a comparatively> tall white race (five-foot eight or taller) who...got their nickname from> their practice of sprinkling red ochre paint (common to Egypt...) over their> dead.510 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1159329] Even more strange is the fact that this “Red Paint People’s” skull measurementsand medical defects appear the closest to the Irish, and that their remains havebeen found over a wide range from Canada, in Labrador and Newfoundland, toNorway, Finland, central Siberia, Mesoamerica, and that their bodies are alwaysburied facing west.511[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1159519]But why red paint? Why that color in particular? The color itself reveals someinteresting associations, again, from legends spanning the globe and seeminglyunrelated cultures. The Hopi Indians of North America, for example,> Have “hundreds of tales” about a mysterious Red City of the South from which> the kachinas came, where the highest learning and moral instruction were> taught in structures specifically designated as pyramids. This may or may not> have been the once-red Mayan city of Tikal.512> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1159669] However, notes Rux, the Hopi nation is not “the only tribe with legends tellingof a lost red land.”513[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1159854]> The “Weeping God” on the Gateway to the Sun at Tiahuanaco514> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1159995] is said to cry for> “the sunken Red Land.” L. Taylor Hansen, in The Ancient Atlantic, quotes a> Sioux chief as saying, “...this is the land of our beginning, where we went> from the old Red Land before it sank, because this land is as old as the> dragon land of the fire god” The Apache myth is the same: “Long before the> Deluge, we used to live in the land of red fire, in a city whose entrance was> hard to find... the mountains were the highest in the world in those days, and> deep down in them was the abode of the fire-god...It was through his rage that> our old land was destroyed: the god left his underground cave, rose up through> the mountain and poured fire and death on the terrified people.”515> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1160165] As Rux rightly observes, the last reference could indicate a massive volcaniceruption. But the problem is the lack of agreement between this legend andothers; they are simply not agreed in its particulars.516[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1160323] Notes Rux, theAwawak Indians likewise have a similar legend about their fire-god, suggestivelynamed “Aimon,” destroying the world by burning and submerging it.517[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1160464] The name “Aimon”might refer, as Rux observes, to Amon-Ra, the Egyptian fire and sun god.And with Ra one has yet another intriguing connection in the catalogue ofassociations with the color red within mythology, for red is “the color worn inbattle by both the Valkyries and Sekhmet, who the ‘Father of Terror,’ Ra, sentwith his eye to burn the human race.”518[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1160605] And moreimportantly, Sekhmet wore red because “it was the color of her homeland.”519[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1160790] So here is anothercurious reference, this time from Egyptian, and not native American Indian,sources associating red with a lost land. Note, too, that Ra is “the Father ofTerror,” a designation that would associate him with the Sphinx at Giza, whichin the Arabic tradition is known as Abu-Hol, the Father of Terrors. As we shallsee later on in this chapter, there are yet more references associating Ra withthe chimerical figure of a sphinx."},{"pageContent":"3. THE “UNDERWORLD” AS A PLANET With Ra, we are back to the theme of the Underworld, where we began thisexcursion with the sarcophagus lid of Lord Pacal in Palenque. Ra, of course,ruled the Egyptian underworld for a time. But the Egyptian underworld, whilecertainly understood to be a real place beneath or inside of the Earth, was alsoa place> In “the west,” under the sea or ocean, or beneath the earth.

THE RED LAND, THE RED MAN, AND THE RED PLANET A. THE RED LAND But which planet is meant?The clues thus far examined, and to be examined, lead inexorably to Mars, theRed Planet. Another clue to the role of Mars in this paleoancient interplanetarywar is found scattered throughout Spell 17 of the Egyptian book of the Dead,where a cryptic reference occurs to the “Children of Heaven” who have “enteredinto the eastern part of the sky,” whence “there straightaway taketh place abattle in haven and in the earth to its whole extent.”521[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1161097]The reference to the “eastern part of the sky” is an astronomical reference, tobe sure, but its meaning must not be associated merely as a reference to wherethe Sun rises. The “eastern part of the sky” refers to those regions of spaceand the planets that lie outside the Earth’s orbit, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn,whereas the “western” part of the sky refers to those regions and planets insidethe Earth’s orbit, Venus, Mercury, and the Sun itself.522[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1161711] Thus, if one followsthe mythological clues, the war involved regions outside the Earth’s orbit, aswell as the planet Earth herself. The war, in other words, could have involvedthe planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and possibly the satellite bodiesassociated with them. This is our first real textual clue of where the war tookplace.There are other indications that support this interpretation. Red, of course,was the color of one of Egypt’s “Two Lands,” the other being black. As Bruce Ruxnotes,> The Red Land was the Sacred Desert in which the Pharonic Pa-Ra-Emheb Stela> named Ra as the engineer who measured the land and built the ‘protected place’> from which he could ‘ascend beautifully and traverse the skies,’ and the> Sphinx in his own image and name (Ra-Harakhte). Red was also the original> color of the Sphinx itself, evidenced by the traces of bright scarlet paint> still found on its uraeus crest and beard in the British Museum. 523> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1161955] Ra appears here as nothing less than the Egyptian counterpart, indeed, perhapsmerely the Egyptian name, of Marduk, who similarly measured the structure of thedeep, and who, as a Babylonian god, possessed his own “ekur” or pyramidalmountain temple, a “protected place.” In other words, Ra and Marduk share notonly the role of “sun-gods”, but also performed similar functions and wereassociated with similar technologies. Presumably this is the reason the ancientEgyptians associated the color red with the home of Ra and Sekhmet, and sincethe latter destroyed the earth with “fire,” also associated red with evil. Noteagain, the association of Ra with the Sphinx via yet another root, the colorwhich they both share.B. THE RED MAN A second association tying Mars to events on Earth is man himself. Thisassociation is no mystery to students of esoteric or astrological lore, for thesymbol for Mars, ♂ is the same as the symbol for man, ♂. But there is more.> Red is the color of the clay from which Adam was made, and the color> associated with the sea Moses crossed in the Exodus. Red is also the color the> Egyptians painted the males of their race in hieroglyphs... In addition to its> aforementioned meanings, Adom means “he of the ruddy complexion,” or “he who> is red.” Adama, and its parallel Akkadian word Adamatu, both had the distinct> meaning of “dark red soil” or “dark red earth.” That red soil was taken by> Enki from the Abzu or Lower World, where he lived, and it was there that he> made mankind.524 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1162156] Alford, of course, would have it that this merely refers to mankind’s lifehaving been “seeded” to Earth by life-bearing meteorites which set the processof evolution in motion. But the ancient texts know of no materialistic conceptlike evolution.There is yet still more: the term “Abzu” or “Absu” is not only a term referringto the sun, but also for a boat or ship of some sort which reaches Enki’s world.It may thus be associated with the “solar barques” which ferried the deceased tothe afterlife both in the Egyptian and Celtic traditions.525[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1162342] The texts thusclearly suggest an inextricable relationship between mankind and Mars, but alsoin some cases even associate the origins of mankind, and the Deluge itself, withMars.And now the plot really thickens..."},{"pageContent":"5. THE TWO SPHINXES OF RA, AND THE TWO EYES OF HORUS As noted above, Ra is associated with the Sphinx. However, as Rux states, thereare problems with that association:> Ra was specifically mentioned in Egyptian stelae as erecting a Sphinx in his> own image in a “protected place,” i.e., a place of pyramids. Until the> discoveries of the Viking probe, we had nothing but Giza to equate that to.> But the Cairo Sphinx does not look like Ra, who was depicted as a hawk - the> Cydonia Sphinx on Mars does.

(This is sounding familiar!)> ...from which he could fire a bolt to kill his enemies - the Cydonia Sphinx> appears to have exactly such an item sculpted on its forehead.526> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1162492] But why refer to the Cydonia Face as a Sphinx at all?Alternative researchers George J. Hass and William R. Saunders, in theirremarkable and provocative book The Cydonia Codex: Reflections from Mars,summarize the history of Richard Hoagland’s, and his associate, Dr. MarkCarlotto’s identification of the Cydonia face as a Sphinx in the followingmanner:> In 1984, Hoagland proclaimed the “Face on Mars” to be the embodiment of a> Martian Sphinx, where the face was half humanoid and half feline. The profound> implication of Hoagland’s claims was that an identical fusion of two specific> combinations of humanoid and feline features exists on massive structures on> two different worlds: Earth and Mars. Using computer enhancements of NASA’s> Viking Frame 70A13 by Dr. Mark Carlotto, Hoagland produced a mirror split of> the “Face.” He was astonished with the results and quickly adopted the title> of Martian Sphinx in reference to the “Face.”527> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1162642] We can perform this experiment ourselves.First, the Viking frame 70A13:037 [images/00037.jpg] Then, Carlotto’s computer enhancement: Carlotto’s Enhanced Image of Viking Frame 70A 13.038 [images/00038.jpg] If one now pauses and recalls Rux’s comments, it would appear that there arethree, and not just two, types of forms being morphed into this fascinatingfigure, for clearly, while the left and right sides each have their own peculiarhumanoid and feline characteristics, as we shall see in a moment, their overallcombination could be loosely construed as ornithological, or bird-like. Theauthor can only add that his own personal reaction, when he first saw thisimage, was one of fright and fear. In short, my reaction to this face is that itconveys a malevolent intention, an intention that will, I believe, become moreapparent with the later images.In any case, Hoagland correctly identified the humanoid and feline aspects ofthis Martian Sphinx.039 [images/00039.jpg] And Hoagland’s humanoid aspect is no less apparent:040 [images/00040.jpg] The above image, in my opinion, is not the countenance or visage of “love,harmony, and peace”; it is most decidedly not Disneyworld “jonquils anddaisies.”But then came the images from the Mars Orbital Camera, in 1998, and it appearedas if the whole Martian Face-Sphinx controversy would die down, for asnationally syndicated radio talk-show host Art Bell quipped, the image lookedlike a cat’s litter box, and the name stuck. The image became “The CatboxImage:”041 [images/00041.jpg] But careful scrutiny of the image will show face-like features. The questionthen became whether this image preserved the peculiar double morphology of aSphinx. If so, then it was, once again, an artificial structure, albeit one ingreat decay. Haas and Saunders set out to do just that.This time, much to the chagrin of “it’s just a mesa” proponents, the flipping ofthe image, after computer rectification to provide an overhead view that couldbe flipped, was nothing less than astounding, as Haas and Saunders point out. 1998 Mars MOC Image, Flipped for Feline Component042 [images/00042.jpg] If anything, the improved optics of the 1998 Mars Orbital Camera only enhanced,rather than overturned, Hoagland’s original Sphinx hypothesis, providing aconfirmation of it. The resemblance of the image to a head-on image of anAfrican male lion is all too apparent and palpable.But what of the humanoid component?Here the results were even more astounding, for not only was the humanoidcomponent confirmed, but Rux’s additional comment that the “headdress” of theFace appeared to show a diadem or jewel of some sort, as associated with Ra’s“eye”, appeared to be confirmed in no uncertain terms, a fact made all the moreremarkable in that Rux wrote his comments in 1996, fully two years before theimage was even captured by the satellite’s camera! 1998 Mars MOC Picture, Humanoid Aspect with Clearly Visible Diadem043 [images/00043.jpg] Ra then, is associated with two Sphinxes, one on Earth, and the other,paradoxically, on Mars.But there is still more.Rux again points the way to yet more Mars-Earth connections by stating that> On the painted papyrus of Queen Nejmet in the Egyptian Department of the> British Museum is a red planet to the right, surmounted by Harpokrates, the> young Horus - it is called “The Red Eye of Horus.” Horus is sometimes referred> to as having “two red eyes” or “two blue eyes”, or as having one red eye with> the other blue. Ra’s “right eye” and “left eye” being used to refer to the Sun> and Moon respectively, and “Thoth’s eye” used to refer to the Moon, we know> that “eyes” are sometimes used by the ancient Egyptians to refer to planets.> Horus lost one of his eyes in battle with Set during the civil wars, having it> restored to him by the magic of Thoth....it is not unreasonable to assume> ...that Horus’ blue eye would of course be the blue planet, Earth. As> reasonably, his red eye would be Mars.528> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1163156] In other words, Earth and Mars describe two parts of an interplanetaryrelationship — a civilization.But Rux then notes a disturbing aspect to this use of “eyes” to mean planets:“An ‘eye’ also can represent a weapon and/or a ship, as has beendemonstrated.”529 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1163341]Moreover, if viewed as a ship, and if one “enters the vehicle which is ‘the eyeof Horus,’ it powers up, and one goes from the blue to the red — morespecifically, in the typical dual meaning of ancient sacred puns, from his ‘blueeye’ to his ‘red eye,’ or from Earth to Mars.”530[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1163491] Indeed, if this“ship” were based on any sort of field propulsion, its ionization of theatmosphere would first start on the blue end of the electromagnetic spectrum andas the “ship” swiftly receded from its point of origin, its radiation wouldundergo the classic Doppler phase shift, from blue to red.Such a trip is related to the Egyptian concept of the Tuat or Duat, which, sinceit contains neither water nor air, and is “an unfathomable abyss... dark withthe blackest darkness” wherein a man can wander, and in which there is no life,is space itself.531 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1163632]At this point, notes Rux, a journey through the Tuat “not only involves oneSphinx - it involves two.”532[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1163782]> A double sphinx (Aker)533> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1163958] can be seen> depicted in the Pyramid Texts and the Book of the Dead, being either two> sphinxes back to back with a solar disk between them, or else a single body> with one head gazing eternally east (as ours does at Cairo), and the other> gazing eternally west...it is referred to as the “Great God who opens the> Gates of Earth.”534> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1164220] The Pa-Ra-Emheb Stele, moreover, refers precisely to “Ra’s building of theSphinx in his image amid a ‘protected place in the Sacred Desert’ with a ‘hiddenname,’ the place of the ‘King of the Gods’ in the ‘secret underworld’.”Additionally, this stele also mentions “the extension of cords and a crossing ofthe sky to the subterranean world where secret things are made.“535[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1164370] And as if that werenot enough, Rux states that Wallis Budge himself wrote in 1934 that> Mars... was called Hor-Tesher, the “Red Horus,” He was said “to journey> backwards in traveling,” and he was also known as “Harakhti,” “Horus of the> Two Horizons.” The God of this planet was Ra; he had the head of a hawk with a> star above it.” The Cydonia Sphinx of Mars is to all appearances exactly that:> the head of a hawk with a star above it, the star (diadem) containing a> stylized human face.536> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1164555] Consequently we have the following relationships:> • The association of Mars with Ra;> • Ra’s association with two sphinxes;> • The existence of the Sphinx at Giza, which may be associated with Ra through> the use of red paints on its beard;> • The apparent existence of a sphinx or chimerical Face on Mars, depicting> both humanoid and feline aspects in its two halves, and an ornithological or> bird-like quality when viewed as a whole, which is associated with Ra’s> depiction as the “Falcon of the Horizon;> • The use of the term “eye” to refer not only to planets, as with the red and> blue eyes of Horus referring to Mars and Earth respectively, but also to refer> to weapons, as with the Eye of Ra, which is used by Sekhmet to destroy all> life on earth in a fiery conflagration;> • The association of Ra’s “eye” with his diadem, which parallels the lapis> exilis or “stone of power” of Lucifer in the Christian tradition,537> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1164713] and the evident> presence of just such a diadem in the “humanoid” version of the 1998 Mars> Orbital Camera’s imaging of the Martian Sphinx;> • The apparent association of Ra, as a sun-god, not only with light, but> apparently with crystals, as with the stone or “eye” of his diadem;> • The association of mankind, of Adam, with the ”red earth“, i.e., the Red> Planet of Mars; and, from chapter two,> • The association of Mars with the “scarred warrior” of some ancient> mythological motifs, a scarring quite visibly demonstrated in the massive scar> of the Valles Marineris.> And last, but surely not least,> • The clear association of Mars with warfare. These associations allow us to hypothesize both who was involved in thispaleoancient war, and where it was fought, for these associations indicate thatthe warfare referred to in ancient Sumerian and Egyptian texts wasinterplanetary - cosmic — in nature, and involved at the minimum, both Mars andEarth, and their “gods.” And we have now yet another variation on our nowfamiliar formula:> Mountains ≈ Celestial Bodies ≈ Pyramids ≈ Eyes ≈ Weapons. Perhaps, in the light of this formula, it is not surprising that the MartianSphinx should likewise be near a “protected compound” of pyramids, the mostmassive of which is the celebrated five-sided D & M Pyramid! We would, however,be remiss if we did not take note of the other players..."},{"pageContent":"6. SATURN AND JUPITER Interestingly enough, Scandinavian tradition records that Saturn (Greek Kronos)was involved in dismembering the body of the deity Mimer, yet anothermythological allusion, from a wholly different quarter than that of Sumer orEgypt, with their “dismembering” of Tiamat or Osiris, indicating that Saturn,perhaps, or one of its satellites, may have also been involved in this ancientwar.538 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1164895] Similarly,Marduk, as a sun-god, is associated not only with Ra and the Sun, but also withthe planet Jupiter. We have already observed that De Santillana and Von Dechindnote the peculiar association of Saturn with Mars.But while there is abundant evidence that Mars might have once been a waterbearing planet and, as the Martian ruins attest, home to intelligent life, thepicture is not so easy when it comes to the two gas giants of the solar system.Clearly neither could be the home to any intelligent life as we know it.However, Richard C. Hoagland has recently pointed out the peculiarly artificialcharacteristics of Saturn’s little moon, Iapetus, in a brilliant, andbreathtaking paper posted on his website, entitled “Moon with a View.”539[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1165080] We shall have moreto say on this matter in a subsequent chapter. But for now we merely note thefollowing: external planetary evidence from Saturn’s moon Iapetus would appearto corroborate in loose fashion the mythological association of Mars, Earth, andSaturn in an ancient interplanetary war that destroyed a citilization based inpart on those worlds.In this regard it is intriguing that Rux finds an association of the Egyptiangod Thoth with the ringed planet.540[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1165629] Moreover, oneversion of the Book of the Dead, the Ra papyrus in the Leiden Museum, even hasThoth ordering the Deluge.541[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1165814] The association ofThoth with the Deluge has been noted elsewhere,542[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1165964] but now Thothclearly enters the picture as one of the main players not only in eventssubsequent to the Deluge, as much esoteric tradition maintains, but in eventsleading up to it. He becomes a part of the conceptual matrix along with Ra,Marduk, Ninurta, Nergal, the Sun, the Earth, Mars, Saturn, the war, and itsassociated technologies. And as if all of this were not enough to consider, evenrabbinical tradition associates Mars with the serpent of Paradise.543[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1166152]In the face of all these diverse and yet intricately interlocking details, it isperhaps not surprising, then, that the Hopi Indian nation of North America has atradition that the world in and on which they live is their fourth world. Theirthird world, to which they fled after their second world was destroyed, was notonly colored red, but lay in the astronomical “east”. After their arrival here,on their fourth world, the former red world was now referred to as being in thewest. As Rux observes,> This, along with the description of a world destroyed by spinning off its axis> and perishing in a Flood, make for a good argument that Earth was abandoned> for Mars, then was returned to when Mars itself was later destroyed - or> perhaps that the Hopi Second World was that shattered planet (mythically> referred to in Babylon as Tiamat) which is now the asteroid belt between Mars> and Jupiter.544 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1166337] Perhaps the reference to a world “spinning off its axis and perishing in aFlood” is not to be interpreted in the standard sense of most catastrophists asa world knocked off its axis of rotation, but of a world knocked off its axis ofrevolution around another planet. If so, then the Hopi tradition provides yetanother mythological confirmation of Van Flandern’s multiple Exploded PlanetHypothesis, where the first event destroyed a large, ancient water-bearingplanet, freeing its satellite (Mars), and concussing it with a massive shockwave of debris and water in a planetary Deluge and destruction by fire.In any case, one thing should now be apparent, and that is that the standardmodels of interpretation of these myths - be they catastrophist or Jungian —simply cannot account for the presence of artificial structures on our nearbyplanetary neighbors nor for the many mythological connections between the Earthand Mars, connections those very artifacts attest to, much less can it accountfor the fact that one entire moon, Iapetus of Saturn, exhibits all thecharacteristics of being itself a gigantic artificial artifact and satellite.But the cosmic war hypothesis can do so, and moreover, is corroborated by theirexistence in a detailed correspondence between mythological motifs and externalevidences that the other methods of mythological interpretation simply fail toaccount for. The actuarial probability that all these correspondences are merelycoincidental would be astronomical.However, important questions and tasks remain, for a broad chronologicalframework has yet to be extrapolated, and more importantly, the moral characterof the combatants, and the enduring legacy of the war itself, have yet to beconsidered in detail...."},{"pageContent":"11. THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE NEPHILIM > “In v.irtually all of the mythologies of the world there is the theme of an> ancient conflict among the gods.

All of> these conflicts relate in one may or another to the original conflict, the> first divine conflict ever set down in writing, which was the ongoing conflict> between Enlil and Enki as told by the ancient Sumerians. ”Peter Goodgame545 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1166538] Certain “characters” from ancient myths have repeatedly appeared throughout thiswork: Ra, Marduk, Ninurta, Nergal, Thoth, Zu, and to a lesser extent, Horus,Osiris, and by implication, the consorts of all of these. This cluster of namesfrom Mesopotamia and Egypt highlights the cultural milieu from which our ownculture’s biblical basis derives, and the poles between which it thus moves.Like all such traditions, it has its own unique way of recounting the sameevents, and its own unique perspectives on why the events happened. This broadMesopotamian-Egyptian context, however, is one largely hidden from most of thepublic and accessible only to a few specialists, or more recently, to thoseinterested in pursuing alternative or revisionist paradigms of ancient humanhistory.Accordingly, in order to gain an appropriate perspective from which to view thepeculiarly biblical understanding of some of these events, it is necessary toplace them against the backdrop of the relationships of the above personages.And the term “relationships” here is to be understood in the fullest sense ofthe term, for it is a little known fact that the genealogies of theseindividuals may be reconstructed from the ancient Mesopotamian myths. Onescholar who has taken the time to do this is Laurence Gardner, in his bookGenesis of the Grail Kings. When one views his genealogical charts one gainsthat additional and much-needed perspective on why the cosmic war was consideredby so many cultures to be a war of rebellion, a “civil war in the pantheon.” Onealso gains an immediate understanding of the central role of mankind in thisstruggle, and a unique and ancient perspective on answering some age oldbiblical riddles. We shall present the first three of Gardner’s genealogicaltables, and then comment on each of them as a way of beginning to answer theimportant questions of ”Who were the ‘good’ guys and the ‘bad’ guys in this war?And why were they good, or bad?”Before doing so, however, a generalized comparison and cautionary note onBiblical and Sumerian parallels is in order."},{"pageContent":"A. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND CAUTIONARY NOTES ON SUMERIAN AND BIBLICAL PARALLELS Ever since Frazer’s The Golden Bough was published in the last years of thenineteenth century, it has become an academic fashion to point out the parallelsbetween biblical stories and motifs and those found in other traditions andmythologies. One theme in particular, that of the “dying and rising god” becamea favorite, with many scholars pointing to Egypt’s god Osiris as perhaps thebest non-Christian example of this motif. Osiris, then, may seem like a veryunusual place to begin a series of generalized observations and cautionary notesabout the Sumerian and Biblical parallels, but it will become highly relevant aswe proceed in this chapter.We will begin with the Coffin Texts from ancient Egypt, which provide twointriguing comments about Osiris:> This is the sealed thing which is in darkness, with fire about it, which> contains the efflux of Osiris, and it was put in Rostau... (Coffin Texts,> Spell 1080)> > > > > > This is the world which is in darkness. As for any spirit who knows it, he> will live among the living. Fire is about it, which contains the efflux of> Osiris. As for any man who shall know it, he will never perish there, since he> knows what shall be in Rostau.... Rostau is (another name) for Osiris...”> (Coffin Texts, Spell 1087). 546> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1166865]Recall that “Rostau” was another name for the underground complex of tunnels atGiza, and by implication, was a metaphor of the “Underworld” itself. Osiris isthus identified in the Coffin texts with this “Rostau” underworld of tunnels.Moreover, note that the Coffin texts imply that some sort of technology guardsOsiris’ “efflux.” Osiris, in other words, is not a good example of a “dying andrising god” — in spite of what many academics would maintain - for a very simplereason. In fact, as Peter Goodgame has aptly observed, Osiris would actuallyseem to be “the least-suited to be a member of the category,” for the simplereason that his rising was not bodily, but in the spirit world. As far as thisworld is concerned, Osiris is a “dead and gone” god, not a “dying and rising”god.547 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1167224]But why would Egypt develop such a complex religious and philosophical traditionto begin with, especially since Egypt springs, fully fledged, into being almostfrom nowhere. As John Anthony West and many other alternative researchers haveobserved, Egypt itself maintains that it is a legacy of something else. But theview was once not restricted merely to alternative researchers. It was once theconsidered opinion of academe’s most respected mainstream scholars, among themthe father of modern Egyptology, Sir William Flinders Petrie. Petrie put forwardhis own theory after his lifetime of exhaustive study, a theory known as the“Dynastic Race” theory. Petrie maintained that> In the pre-dynastic era Egypt was invaded by a technologically superior group> of elite foreigners who came originally from Mesopotamia. This “Dynastic Race”> invaded and conquered Upper Egypt and settled... near where the important cult> centers of Abydos, Thebes, Luxor and Edfu would later emerge. Petrie referred> to this invading force as the “Falcon Tribe,” and the name of their capital of> Nekhen means ”City of the Falcon.“548> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1167583] But as Peter Goodgame correctly observes, this racially-based theory quicklyfell into disrepute in academic circles after the horrors of World War Two andthe Nazi party’s genocide in the name of racial superiority. It was replacedwith an ill-considered “nationalism” in Egyptology as the former Europeancolonies of Africa broke away from their former superintending imperial powers.Nonetheless, Petrie’s theory appears to have great merit, for it explains whythere are so many detailed comparisons between the mythologies of Egypt andMesopotamia, comparisons illustrated in the peculiar conceptual parallelsbetween Edfu and the Tablets of Destinies.Sumeria, then, forms the other terminus, along with Egypt, between which theBiblical narrative of the Old Testament flows, and thus it was only natural forscholars to seek parallels between the two.And parallels there undoubtedly are.Peter Goodgame puts the case for these parallels, and the problems they raise,in very precise terms:> Much of pagan mythology and religion, in its many different forms and cultural> expressions, can be traced back to this original conflict, but it is> interesting that the accounts that most closely parallel the Sumerian accounts> of creation, of the gods, and of human civilization and religion, are not to> be found in later “pagan” traditions, but are instead found in Hebrew> accounts, specifically the book of Genesis. Both the Sumerians and the Hebrews> told a story of mankind being created from the earth of clay with divine> assistance; both sources refer to an ancient dispute between a farmer and a> shepherd; both give an account of gods or angels descending from heaven and> influencing human civilization; both mention the creation of the first city;> both testify of a great flood that covered the land which wiped out> civilization and almost all of mankind; and both speak of the conquests of a> great king who was involved in some way with a great temple or tower and with> the creation of the many languages that divided the nations.549> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1167928] But this raises a very obvious and pertinent series of questions.> How could such a strict form of Hebrew monotheism have “evolved” from the> liberal and diverse polytheistic religion of the Sumerians? Another way to> pose this question is: Where is the God of Israel to be found within the> Sumerian pantheon? This is a good question to ask because Abraham, the founder> of the nation of Israel, was supposedly called out by God from the city of Ur,> which was located in the heart of the land of the Sumerians.550> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1168164] To put it differently, we are looking at two parts of a whole, with each partrepresenting two very diverse and antithetical theologies.But this does not answer the question Goodgame poses: Where in the Sumerianpantheon would one locate the Hebrew God, Yahweh? Or to state it differently,where in the Hebrew “angelic hierarchies” would one place the principal Sumeriangods? However one asks the question, the fundamental problem remains. There are,notes Goodgame, three main contenders for the Sumerian equivalent of the HebrewGod Yahweh: Anu, Enlil, and Enki.The Yahweh-Anu parallel is exemplified in two major ways, according to Goodgame.Anu is, like Yahweh, a “father” god dwelling in the uttermost and inaccessibleglory of heaven.551 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1168312]But the “apparent relationship between YHWH and Enlil is much more substantial.”Even though Enlil was not viewed by the Sumerians as the original creator god,he nonetheless was the ultimate King over all gods, and over mankind as well,and some Sumerian myths even refer to Enlil, and not Enki, as the creator ofmankind. This important point - the disputed origin of mankind through theaction of Enlil or Enki - is, as we shall see, ably resolved by Laurence Gardnerby reincorporating the Hebrew component into the story. But there is one lastimportant Yahweh-Enlil parallel, and that is that both gods directly order theFlood.But it is, paradoxically, the parallels between Yahweh and Enki that are themost pervasive, persuasive, and disturbing, for Enki would in some lights alsoappear to be the best Sumerian candidate for a parallel to the Biblicaltradition’s Lucifer. Goodgame notes that Enki, like Yahweh, is the most“personal” of all the Sumerian gods, and like Yahweh, he was “viewed by theSumerians as powerful, kind, and wise in his schemes to protect the Sumeriansfrom the animosity of other gods (especially Enlil) and from neighboring enemytribes.” And in many Sumerian myths it is Enki, and not Enlil, who is personallyinvolved in the creation of mankind, though as we saw in a previous chapter, bya particularly grizzly method.552[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1168460]However, the closest parallel between Enki and Yahweh lies at what is the mostimportant theophany in all the Old Testament, that of Yahweh to Moses in at theBurning Bush, recounted in Exodus 3:13-14:> 13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel> and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and> they shall say unto me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? And God> said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the> children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. David Rohl, another scholar of these parallels, explains the theophany’sSumerian background and its densely punning word play this way:> As we have learnt, Enki... was called Ea in Akkadian (East Semitic)-that is to> say in the Babylonian tradition. Scholars have determined that Ea was> vocalized as “Eya”. So, when Moses stood before the burning bush and asked the> name of the god of the mountain, did he really reply “I am who I am”(Hebrew> Eyah asher eyah)? This puzzling phrase has long perplexed theologians553> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1168783] but now there is a> simple explanation. The voice of God simply replied “Eyah asher Eyab”-“I am> (the one) who is called Eyah” the name of Ea in its West Semitic (i.e. Hebrew)> form. Scholars have simply failed to recognize that this is another of those> characteristic puns in which the Old Testament abounds. “I am (Eyah) he who is> called (asher) Ea (Eyah)” is a classic biblical play on words. It also> explains God’s apparently nonsensical instruction: “This is what you are to> say to the Israelites, “I am has sent me to you.” God’s words should really be> translated as “Eyah has sent me to you.”> “Eyah” or simply “Ya” is the hypocoristic form of the name Yahweh found as an> element of so many Old Testament names. So Enki/Ea, the god who created Man> and then later warned Zuisudra/Utnapishtim of the impending destruction of> mankind, is one and the same as the god of Moses.554> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1169156] But there all similarity ceases. While not discounting the probable biblicalrelationship of Yahweh to Enki, the two figures nonetheless possess importantdistinctions. Enki, for one, is a sorcerer, experienced in the practice of magicof all varieties, whereas the biblical traditions of Yahweh specificallyprohibit such practices. Moreover, Yahweh in the biblical tradition is clearlyassociated with the actual first creation as well as with the creation ofmankind. Enki, on the other hand, has no such honor in the Sumerian texts, beingassociated only with the creation of mankind, but not the first creation itself.And finally, there is no special “covenant relationship” between Enki and theSumerians, while there is between the Yahweh and the Hebrews.555[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1169520]With these thoughts in hand, we are now able to view Gardner’s use of theSumerian and Biblical-Judaic tradition to compile a total picture. We shall citeonly the first three tables of Gardner’s extensive “divine genealogies.”"},{"pageContent":"B. SIR LAURENCE GARDNER’S GENEALOGICAL TABLES The first table understandably is the most ancient, going far back into themists of pre-history, to the original revolt of Tiamat, to her theft of theTablets of Destinies, and to her subsequent destruction in a war by Marduk."},{"pageContent":"1. GARDNER’S “GRAND ASSEMBLY OF THE ANNUNAKI” The Grand Assembly of the Annunaki 556[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1169861]044 [images/00044.jpg] There are a number of crucial points to be observed about this chart. First andforemost is that it preserves the mythological character of Tiamat, Apsu, andAn. Tiamat, it will be recalled from previous chapters, is not only a galacticsymbol as De Santillana and Von Dechind averred, but also a planetary symbol, aswell as a symbol for the primeval waters of chaos. Absu is the “Abyss” orprimordial deep itself, and sometimes functions as a symbol of the Sun. Anu andKi are two of their “children”, and clearly this distinguishes them from Tiamat,because the genealogical chart supports the notion that as a planetary symbol,Tiamat does not refer to the Earth, but to “Elsewhere,” to the first explodedplanet, and perhaps to an even more galactic context.Secondly, observe the “marriage relationships” between brothers and sisters,and, as will be seen in a moment, between half-brothers and half-sisters. Thisis one of the stable features both of Mesopotamian and Egyptian dynasticpractice.Thirdly, observe that these “consanguineous” relationships assume particularimportance with the two great Anunnaki gods Enlil and Enki, both brothers whoshare their sister Nin-khursag, or Ninhursag, as their wife. In this context,the placement of Marduk becomes paramount, for as a son of Enki, he is on theopposite side of the family - one “great big happy pantheon” all! - from hisdistant “great-grandmother” Tiamat - whom he would eventually destroy - and fromthe Enlil side of the pantheon. Note too that Marduk is cousin to Ninurta.Finally, note that many of the gods are “titled,” as being lords or “gods” of aparticular realm, or, alternatively, a specific functional “department” of the“pantheonic government.” Thus, one might likewise be looking at a genealogicalchart of the relations not only of individuals but of dynasties.Thus, when Marduk recovers the Tablets of Destinies from Tiamat, theirpossession passes from one side of the “family” or pantheon, to the other. Ifthis sounds a little farfetched, one need only recall that World War One, from acertain point of view, may be understood as a family “feud” of gargantuanproportions between the Von Hohenzollerns in Germany, the Romanovs in Russia,the Von Sachse-Coburgs (Windsors) in England, and the Von Hapsburgs in Austria,all of which families were intricately and inextricably interrelated throughdecades of intermarriages. Kaiser Wilhelm was thus a cousin to Tsar Nicholas andto King George, a nephew of Queen Victoria, and a distant relation of KaiserFranz Josef of Austria, King Leopold of Belgium, and King Vittorio Emannuel ofItaly! World War One, viewed in this somewhat simplistic and veryover-generalized light, was a “civil war” of sorts, between the interrelatedHouses of Europe. The same holds true of the Sumerian and Babylonian traditionsof the cosmic war; it is in every respect a family war, a civil war and revoltin the pantheon."},{"pageContent":"2. THE “GRAND ASSEMBLY OF THE ANNUNAKI” AND MANKIND However, it is at the second of Gardner’s genealogical tables that things beginto become very interesting indeed. Gardner’s Fourth through Sixth Generations of the Grand Assembly of theAnunnaki557 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1170168]045 [images/00045.jpg] The reader should bear in mind that the solid lines of this chart connect withthe ones in the previous table. Thus, Nabak is the son of Marduk, while Nergalis revealed to be the son of Enlil and Ninlil. Consider what this means from thepoint of view of the texts examined in chapters five and six: it means thatEnlil and Enki, who themselves at some point are guardians or keepers of theTablets of Destinies, have “traded off” guardianship of the objects from oneside of the pantheon to the other, or that they became booty of war in thepantheon’s ongoing warfare. Recalling that Nergal is also the “god” of Mars andwar, and at one brief period also in possession of the Tablets, it would seem toindicate that they had not only been passed from one wing of the pantheon familyto the other, but from one planet to another, from Earth to Mars or vice versa.This would be corroborated by the interplanetary implications of the Two Eyes ofHorus, as discussed in the previous chapter.But note who Nergal’s daughter is: the infamous Lilith of Jewish tradition,Adam’s first wife.Thus, at the final tier of Gardner’s three initial genealogical charts, wearrive at Adam, Eve, and Lilith. And at this point an even more suggestive andintriguing set of relationships becomes evident."},{"pageContent":"3. THE ANUNNAKI AND MANKIND: ADAM, EVE, AND LILITH Gardner’s Chart of the Sumerian Version of Adam and Eve 558[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1170355]046 [images/00046.jpg] Note that Lilith, daughter of the notorious character Nergal whom we encounteredin chapter five, is married in turn both to Adam and to Enki, who likewiseshares Eve with Adam. Viewed in a certain way, it is a “marriage of politicalexpedience” for the two sides of the pantheon - Enlil’s and Enki’s - arereunited in mankind himself. If one recalls what was said in the previouschapter about the peculiar associations within esoteric literature of mankindwith Mars, then this chart gives yet one more detail testifying to a connectionbetween mankind and Mars, this time via Lilith and her relationship to Nergal.Note something else. Enki, who figures previously in the charts as an ancestorto all these figures - Adam, Eve, Nergal and Lilith - is now not only ancestorand consort to the two female figures, but also both ancestor, brother-in-law,cousin, and son-in-law to the male figures. This means that Enki, in a certainsense, is “still around,” i.e., that he is either very long-lived, or that thename “Enki” refers to someone from the House of Enki. Either way, the chartpoints up a significant problem, and it is best to examine it here.From one standpoint, Gardner’s research provides an answer to the age-oldquestion that has haunted biblical scholars, and that is that the book ofGenesis only records Cain and Abel as the offspring of Adam and Eve, and yet, inGen 4:17, Cain sires offspring of his wife. Where did she come from? Thestandard answer has always been that this unnamed wife was some other child ofthe biblical progenitors of humanity Adam and Eve. The Sumerian context, Jewishtradition, and Gardner’s charts suggest another answer altogether: Cain’s wifemay have been a descendant of some other wing of the pantheon.Let us also recall who and what the Anunnaki are and mankind’s relationship tothem. Note the dotted lines connecting Adam and Eve to the rest of the pantheon.According to the interpretation of Sitchin and others, the Sumerian textsindicate that Adam and Eve were deliberately and genetically engineeredcreatures, a hybrid between the Anunnaki themselves, and a proto-human hominidalready in existence on Earth. Man was thus part “clay” and part “god.” In thisthe biblical and Sumerian versions are not so different, and even in thebiblical version of the creation of mankind by the direct action of God, thereis a parallel, for in the Sumerian version the creation of mankind is similarlyby the direct action of the “gods,” the Anunnaki. Only the mechanism of creationdiffers between the two versions, for the Sumerian version has it that the“clay” in mankind is precisely a pre-existing living creature geneticallyadaptable to, and adapted by, the Anunnaki. The Anunnaki, in short, are theSumerian equivalent of the Nephilim, the “sons of God,” of Genesis 6.Note what this means for the “situation” of mankind in the Sumerian version:mankind - Adam and Eve’s direct descendants - is not directly connected toeither side of the pantheon, whereas there is a continuation of the Annunakiline via Enki and Lilith, on Nergal’s side of the pantheon, and there is also afurther hybridized part-human, part Anunnaki line deriving from Eve and Enki onthe other side, a line independent of Nergal’s “more pure” Anunnaki line.Mankind exists in a precarious middle ground between these two dynastic lines.The obvious implication that follows from this should not be left unstated, forthese charts indicate that ancient Sumerian belief was that their “gods” werereal personages, capable of interbreeding with mankind.Viewed in this light, the Sumerian texts indicate that there are three majorlines of players on the field after the creation of mankind:> 1. The “pure” Anunnaki line of Nergal-Enki-Lilith;> 2. The “corrupted” and ultra-hybridized Anunnaki-human line of Enki-Eve; and,> 3. A “pure” human line of Adam and Eve. This is a dynamic tailor-made for conflict, for there are two “pure” lines, theNergal Anunnaki line, and the Adam-Eve human line. But there are also two“hybrid” lines, the hybrid Anunnaki-human line of Enki-Eve, and the line ofmankind from Adam and Eve itself, which is a “less hybridized” line. Finally,there are two Anunnaki lines, the line of Nergal, and the line of Enki-Eve.It is interesting to ponder the second of these lineages, the “corrupted” or“ultra-hybridized” line of Enki-Eve, from the standpoint of the biblicaltradition of the “Nephilim,” of the “sons of God” of Genesis 6, who came downfrom heaven, and sired hybrid chimerical children of “the daughters of men,”producing a race of giants, for the account of this activity in Genesis gives noindication of when this activity began. The Sumerian version indicates when: itwas present almost from the beginning of the human race. And as for the giantsthemselves, we have already speculated that the inhabitants of the planetTiamat, if such there were, may have been physiologically much larger thanmankind’s average size, given Tiamat’s much higher gravity.Moreover, there is an odd corroboration of the tradition of chimerical offspringof such unions from yet another source, and this is the traditional depiction ofEnki, who is sometimes “shown with the legs of a goat complete with clovenhooves, whilst his upper body is clothed in the scales of a fish.”559[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1170542] He is a “goatfish,”a Capricorn. Enki himself, in other words, is a chimerical being, who in turn,as a “son of God” in the Biblical perspective, sires similar chimericaloffspring.However, there is a second connection between the Sumerian and Biblicalversions, for in the account of the destruction of Tiamat in the Enuma Elish,her creation of chimerical biological life-forms as weapons appears to be oneprincipal reason she incurred the wrath of the rest of the gods, in addition toher theft of the Tablets of Destinies. In the Biblical version, the story of theNephilim and their hybrid-giant offspring forms the immediate context for thedivine decision to wipe out mankind for his wickedness. The clear implicationis, once again, that it was the continued co-habitation of man and “the sons ofGod” that formed a motivation for the Deluge. These points suggest a furtherspeculation: could the creation of mankind in the Sumerian version be related tothe cosmic war and the theft of the Tablets of Destinies?Whatever the answer to that question may be, one thing seems to be stronglyimplied by all that has preceded, and that is that according to the Sumeriantradition mankind appears to be centrally connected both to the motivations ofthe cosmic war and is to an extent also a legacy of it, at least in thehybridized Nephilimic line. In the Sumerian version, it is human overpopulationthat formed one of the motivations for the war, and in the Biblical version, itis the “Nephilimic wickedness” that forms the backdrop of the divine decision towipe out “mankind” by means of the Deluge. Putting two and two together, itwould appear that it is the Enki-Eve line that may have been the focus ofattention here, both as a chimerical ultra-hybridized lineage, and perhaps as anoverly-populated one vis-à-vis the “pure human lineage” of Adam and Evethemselves. Indeed, we may be drawing near to one reason why the various booksof the Old Testament place such an emphasis on preserving various genealogicalrecords, for as an examination of those records will demonstrate, there islittle if any association of the Old Testament patriarchal lineage with thesecond “ultra-hybridized” lineage of Enki-Eve. In fact, the converse is true,for from the moment of the Hebrew Exodus from Egypt to the conquest andoccupation of Canaan, an endless struggle is waged against the Nephilimicdynasties of surrounding peoples, the story of David and Goliath being the mostfamiliar example. To put it as bluntly and briefly as possible, one legacy ofthe conflict appears to be an ongoing “struggle between the bloodlines.”Unfortunately, as fascinating as this story is, as it weaves its way throughhistory, it is not a story that can be recounted here, for it would require abook in its own right.The relationship between Enki and Eve revives an ancient Talmudic tradition in aparticular way, for Enki here takes on the principal role of what Genesisdescribes as being the activities of the Nephilim, of the “sons of God” whomarried human wives and sired chimerical, giant offspring. In a roundabout way,then, Gardner has confirmed Genesis’ own characterization of the Nephilim, acharacterization supported by the Sumerian’s traditional artistic renditions ofEnki as a chimerical being."},{"pageContent":"C. NINURTA-NIMROD AND THE TOWER OF BABEL MOMENT Another intriguing Biblical-Sumerian perspective on the events of the cosmic waris provided by the Tower of Babel episode. As will be seen in a moment, thisepisode also leads back to Egypt, and Osiris, in a very peculiar fashion.Previous chapters have mentioned the close association of the Anunnaki godNinurta with the Biblical figure of Nimrod. Any comparison of the Sumeriangenealogy of Ninurta with the Biblical genealogy of Nimrod in Genesis 10 willdemonstrate there is little if any parallel between the two. So why associatethe two?Beyond the prosaic level of the fact that Ninurta’s temple was centered atNimrud in modern day Iraq, there are other much more suggestive themes that linkthe two. For example, one of Ninurta’s titles that Gardner’s genealogical chartclearly highlights is his title of “The Mighty Hunter,” a title associated inturn with Ninurta’s defeat of (An)Zu. It is, in other words, a titledeliberately and directly associated with the cosmic war and the theft andrecovery of the Tablets of Destinies, with their universal-power bestowingproperties. As Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley notes, Ninurta is the avenger andchampion of Enlil and the leader of the Anunnaki in that phase of the war thatconcerned itself with the second theft of the Tablets.560[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1170865] It is with thistapestry of concepts and titles associated with Ninurta that one finds theresemblance to the Biblical figure of Nimrod.Nimrod is mentioned only very briefly in the Old Testament, in Genesis 8: 8-10.The context here is significant, for Genesis 8 forms one part in the total“Flood” context that begins with chapter 6 and ends with the Tower of Babelmoment in chapter 11. At this point, it is worth quoting what Genesis 8:8-10 hasto say about him:> 8. And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.> 9. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as> Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.> 10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and> Calneh, in the land of Shinar.561> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1171047] Thus Nimrod shares with Ninurta the distinctive title of “Mighty Hunter.” And inthe biblical version, it is clear that Nimrod is given this title because he isa conqueror, indeed, the very first conqueror-despot mentioned in the Bible. Inthis he closely parallels Ninurta, who obtained his title of Mighty Hunter forsimilarly warlike reasons.It is also interesting to note the context in which these verses occur withinchapter ten, for the entirety of the rest of the chapter is nothing but a recordof “the generations of the sons of Noah (v. 1).” In other words, the usualsuccession of “begats” is interrupted momentarily to provide a small commentaryon the enigmatic figure of Nimrod, and then the text resumes for twenty-one moreverses of “begats”, whereupon the chapter ends, and the eleventh chapter begins.And this is significant, for the eleventh chapter of Genesis begins immediatelywith the story of the Tower of Babel in verses 1- 9. Now note what Gen 8:10 saysabout Nimrod’s kingdom: it began in Babel. This strongly suggests that thebiblical account intends for the reader to associate Nimrod with the Tower ofBabel moment.Now let us recall - once again - what I said in my book The Giza Death StarDestroyed about the Tower of Babel moment."},{"pageContent":"1. THE GENESIS ACCOUNT “There is another event that bears mentioning with regard to the decline of thepaleoancient Very High Civilization and its presumably unified physics andsophisticated technology: the Tower of Babel. The Old Testament affords asignificant clue into the event that transformed the unified and paleoancientVery High Civilization into a multitude of squabbling and declined legacycultures that resulted from it. The story is recounted in Genesis 11: 1-9:> 1. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.> 2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a> plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt with there.> 3.

Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there> confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter> them abroad upon the face of all the earth.562> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1171256] “In the context of the broad scenario previously outlined, the “Tower of BabelMoment” permits a further speculation: could the “one language” and “one people”be taken in the broadest sense, not only of one natural human language and onecivilization, but of one language of science, a unified science and physics? Andcould the “one people” refer not only to that one paleoancient Very HighCivilization, but also to the unifying cultural effects that “one language” andunified scientific worldview afforded it? Nothing in the biblical accountprecludes these possibilities, and indeed, there is a strong indication that theTower may be the Pyramid itself, if one understands the “top which reaches toheaven” to be a metaphor of the Pyramid’s many dimensional analogs of localcelestial mechanics. By a similar line of reasoning, a unified physics andscience is implied in the divine observation that “nothing will be restrainedfrom them, which they have imagined to do.” Clearly, the “Tower” was noRenaissance painting of vast brickwork straining to reach skyscraper heightswith wooden scaffolding and cranes groaning to lift massive weights to enormousheights. Something else entirely was at work. In this context, it might not begoing too far to speculate that the destruction of the Tower of Babel may refer,in oblique terms, to the destruction of “the Great Affliction” and “Weapon,” theGreat Pyramid.”And thus I wrote in The Giza Death Star Destroyed.But we now have new data that forms part of the paleophysical context from whichto view the Tower of Babel moment, and these are the Tablets of Destinies, whichas we have seen throughout the previous chapters, not only conveyed a universalpower to their possessors, but their power - as we have theorized - was based onthe fact that they were catalogues of the holographic interferometric “gratings”of objects in local space, inclusive of the emotional states of consciousbeings. Recalling also that R.A. Boulay stated that the Tablets or MEs were akind of “instruction manual” or software to a technology of some sort, then itstands to reason that one way to interfere with or to destroy a project designedto build - or rebuild - an “ekur,” “tower” or “pyramid” that utilized theTablets in a hegemony-bestowing way was to render the “software” inoperable byrendering its human interpreters incapable of understanding its “operatinglanguage.” It is a classic maneuver in a kind of guerilla warfare.To put it differently, if Nimrod is associated with Ninurta, then he isassociated with the Tablets of Destinies, and this in turn means that theBiblical account of the Tower of Babel may be yet another chapter in the saga ofthe Tablets and the Story of the Stones."},{"pageContent":"2. THE SUMERIAN TOWER OF BABEL But Nimrod is also associated with...Enki. In the Sumerian version of the Towerof Babel, known as Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, composed ca. 2000 BC andthus in all likelihood older than the Genesis version of the story, the “wholeworld, the people as one, to Enlil in one tongue gave voice.”563[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1171510] Then enters apeculiar character, En, or Enki:> Then did the contender - the en (lord)> > The contender - the master> > The contender - the king> > The contender - the en> > The contender - the master> > The contender - the king> > > Enki, en of hegal,> The one with the unfailing words,> En of cunning, the shrewd one of the land,> Sage of the gods, gifted in thinking,> The en of Eridu,> Change the speech of their mouths,> He having set up contention in it,> In the human speech that had been one.564> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1171859] Nimrod in the Sumerian version of the story is represented by the characterEnmerkar. Now note that in the Hebrew, with is a consonantal alphabet, the nameNimrod would be represented n-m-r-d. In Sumerian, the character Enmerkar issimply Enmer, to which the suffix “kar,” meaning “hunter”, has been added. Enmerwould be consonantally represented as n-m-r.565[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1172008]The parallels do not stop there.The Sumerian Kings List, to which reference has already been made in this book,states that Enmerkar also constructed Uruk. In Genesis, the center of Nimrod’skingdom was Babel or Babylon and Erech, which is another name for Uruk. Here toothere is reason to believe the Biblical text, given its antiquity, might notrefer to Babel or Babylon, but to Eridu, the cult headquarters for Enki. Thisheadquarters was known as the “nun-ki” or “mighty place,” a title that was onlybestowed on Babylon some one thousand years later with the temple to Marduk thatwas dedicated there, where it was known as the “bab-ilu”, its Akkadian name. “Inother words, Bab-ilu equates to Nun.ki, and the original Nun.ki was located notin Babylon, but in Eridu.”566[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1172348] Archaeology wouldappear to support this idea, since there is an impressive ziggurat that wasunearthed in the 1940s at the ancient site of Eridu. More importantly, theexcavators discovered that at the hightest point of this massive ziggurat, theentire settlement was entirely and suddenly abandoned.567[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1172497]This surely seems as far from Egypt, Giza, and Osiris as one can get.However, the picture is not quite that simple, for the name Osiris itself washieroglyphically written as the sigil for a throne, followed by that of an eye,but the order was subsequently reversed. The Egyptian form of Orisis, Ausar, isa cognate of the Mesopotamian Ashur, and implies someone who possesses histhrone. Other meanings are “The seat that creates” and “The seat of the eye,”and “the Mighty one.,,568[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1172646] The connections withthe “Sound Eye” of the Edfu texts and with the title of Nimrod in Genesis arenow apparent. The revisionist scholar David Rohl explains this constellation ofsymbols — Osiris, Nimrod, Eridu-Babel, and the Tower of Babel — this way:> It appears that we are dealing here with a single historical character who> established the first empire on Earth and who was deified by many nations> under four main groupings:> > > (1) Early Sumerian Enmer, later Mesopotamian Ninurta, ...biblical Nimrod,> > Greek Ninus;> > > (2) Old Babylonian Marduk, biblical Merodach, later simply known as Bel of> > Baal(“Lord”);> > > (3) Late Sumerian Asar-luhi...Assyrian Ashur, Egyptian Asar (Osiris);> > > (4) Sumerian Dumuzi, biblical Tammuz, Phoenician Adonis, Greek Dionysius,> > Roman Bacchus...569> > [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1172795]> > If this identification proves true, then the connection of the Tower of Babelnot only with Eridu but also with Giza, which I first speculated upon in my GizaDeath Star Destroyed,570[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1172980] appears even moresolid, for now the connections are between Osiris, Nimrod, and Osiris’ restingplace in the “Rostau” or Underworld of Giza.We are in the presence, once again, of the richly punning, multilayered levelsof meaning of the Unified Intention of Symbol, for there are now numerousconnections between Giza, the wars of the Gods, Mars, the Tower of Babel moment,and mankind itself. And as the previous chapters have also detailed, we arelikewise in the presence of texts that preserve a dim, though still verydiscernible pattern of the technology that was associated with those wars andindeed, in some accounts, was their cause. And there is one more connection thatmust now be mentioned.

PRIMORDIAL REVOLTS AND WARS: SUMER, EDFU, AND THE GENESIS “GAP” THEORY As was seen in previous chapters, there are two “primordial revolts and wars,”that referred to in the Edfu texts from Egypt, and that referred to in the EnumaElish and other texts from Mesopotamia. There is a third major tradition fromthat world that must now be examined, for it moves between Mesopotamia and Egyptthroughout its history, and that is the Hebrew tradition of the Old Testamentand other writings.But its movement within this mytho-cultural matrix is scarcely appreciated forwhat it is: a variation on the broad theme of the cosmic war. The subject is, ofcourse, the Fall of Lucifer. Unfortunately however, both “believers” and“skeptics” know this only in basic “Sunday school” version and thus only in itsbroad outlines, but neither of these two polarities tends to view the angelicrevolt and fall against this broader mythological and cultural context, and somewould be positively disinclined to do so, for ill-conceived “theological”reasons. Nonetheless, it is important to do so, since the Fall of Luciferprovides yet a third corroboration of the idea of a primordial revolt and war inthe pantheon.This event is usually best examined in conjunction with another theory, theso-called “gap” theory of creation, for in this theory, the Fall of Lucifer isusually understood to have occurred prior to the creation of mankind.573[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1173758] A hint of thepossibility of a pre-existent civilization on the earth prior to the creation ofmankind may be found in Jeremiah 4:23-26:> 23 I beheld the earth, and lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens,> and they had no light.> 24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved> lightly.> 25 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were> fled.> 26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities> thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger. The fact that this passage uses the same phrase, “without form and void” todescribe conditions suggests that the time frame involved is that described inGenesis 1:1. Yet, as Stephen Quayle points out, there are three indicators that,while the time-frame of Genesis 1:1 is more or less in mind, there is also acivilization in existence:> • Birds were present. This suggests that the previous creation had elements> similar to today’s...> • The pre-Adamic land was “fruitful” and therefore had vegetation that> supplied abundant food.> • There were ancient cities that pre-dated Adam, which were “broken down” by> God’s wrath.574 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1173946] In other words, the Old Testament itself strongly suggests the idea of apre-cursor, pre-human civilization on the earth. Moreover, it strongly hintsthat the reason for its collapse was some sort of war.But what of Genesis itself?The usual translation of Genesis 1:1 has always been “In the beginning, Godcreated the heavens and the earth.” But as many biblical scholars have not tiredof pointing out, the Hebrew language’s verb system and other peculiarities ofits grammar would also permit the translation When God began to create theheavens and the earth,” and then the second verse would immediately follow, “theearth was without form, and void...” and so on. This way of translating theverse, and viewing it in conjunction with the passage from Jeremiah quotedabove, led to the formation by some theologians and commentators of the “GapTheory.” This theory holds that there was an initial creation by God, thatLucifer and his hosts subsequently fell, and corrupted this original creation.In some versions of the theory, Lucifer and his hosts fell almost immediatelyafter the initial creation, a view that would corroborate the Edfu texts’ notionof a primordial fall, a fall and conflict that occurs just as the transmutativeaether is being fashioned by the gods into a recognizable world.In any case, the Gap Theory holds that after this angelic fall, the “war inheaven” between Lucifer and his fallen angels, and Michael the Archangel and theheavenly hosts, occurred, wreaking havoc on creation itself. Thus, a “secondcreation” was brought about by God, this time not out of nothingness, but ratherto “repair” the damage, so to speak, caused by that war. Like the Sumeriantradition, this war even has Lucifer and his hosts falling to the earth from thesky.Author Stephen Quayle interprets this theory against the twin backdrops of theplanetary anomalies on Mars and elsewhere, and against the backdrop ofcatastrophism:> Exactly how the ancient Earth became “without form and void” is hard to say.> But there are several events that appear to have taken place which would have> done the job, and thus, might have been employed by God to wipe the face of> the Earth clean.

In any case,as Quayle points out, “Since Mars and other planets, as well as the planet-sizedmoons of Jupiter and Saturn also exhibit this destruction, one might alsospeculate that these worlds and moons might also have been inhabited by angels,or even space-faring giants.”577[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1174469]Regardless of whether or not one accepts Quayle’s interpretation in its narrowbiblical application, it is clear that it does fit the wider Mesopotamian andEgyptian context that we have examined in conjunction with the Sumerian and Edfutexts, and in that context the biblical “war in heaven” would appear to beanother version of the great cosmic war in the pantheon those texts describe."},{"pageContent":"1. A CHRONOLOGICAL OUTLINE EMERGES Putting these observations together with Van Flandern’s Multiple Exploded PlanetHypothesis, the Sumerian Enuma Elish, and the Edfu texts, one has a “primordialrevolt” occurring somewhere between shortly after the initial creation and65,000,000 years ago, with the explosion of the large planet in the asteroidbelt, with the resulting evidence of a massive catastrophe that occurred atapproximately that time that exists in the K/T geological boundary layer.After this, a “second creation” occurs which repairs the damage. It is importantto note that both the “Gap Theory” and the Edfu building texts, with theiremphasis on the creation of a second “island” at the Rostau, both maintain moreor less the same sequence of events.Following this, there is a period in which there is a civilization that appearsto exist on Mars, the Earth, and possibly the Moon, and then a second, smallerplanetary explosion ca. 3,200,000 years ago, according to Van Flandern. Thisevent, it will be recalled, did not leave sufficient geological evidence of itsoccurrence on the earth, and thus Van Flandern was led to modify his initialtheory and to posit that it was the explosion of a much smaller celestial body.But as will be recalled, I posited an alternative explanation for the relativeabsence of such a layer as the K/T layer for this event, and that was that itmay be possible that this more recent event occurred when the exploding planet,and the earth, were at their farthest distance from each other. In this case,such damage as would be recorded in the geological data would be of a morerandom and sporadic nature, as the earth subsequently moved through the “debris”field of this explosion.Another point should be observed, and that is the presence within the GreatPyramid’s remaining limestone, of small fossils dating to about 5,000,000 yearsago. This would tend to indicate the very remote possibility that, while notbuilt in time for the 65,000,000 years event, it may have been very remotelypossible for it to have been built in time for the event at 3,200,000 years ago.However, most of the other chronological data concerning the Pyramid woulddefinitely exclude this possibility, since they indicate the structure is onlythousands of years old, and possibly pre-dates the Flood event at 10,500 BC, bysome unknown number of years.Sometime after this second planetary explosion, we have the possibility of athird event, the “Flood event” ca. 10,500 -15,000 years ago.As noted previously, the explosion of a large water-bearing Saturn-sizedplanetary mass, which may have been home to intelligent life, would have had twopossible confirmations: (1) such life would likely have been, by humanstandards, of very large, or “gigantic” stature; and (2) the explosion of awater-bearing planet of that size would have concussed its nearest neighbor,Mars, with a shock wave of water and debris that would have scoured thehemisphere of that planet that faced the exploding planet, and inundated theother hemisphere with a truly planet-wide deluge. This shock wave would havereached the earth in a dissipated form, causing similar wide-spread planetarydamage.In any case, viewing the texts in this light against the backdrop of VanFlandern’s Multiple Exploded Planet Hypothesis highlights one fact about thecosmic war, if one ascribes both planetary explosions to that war, and that is,the war was cosmic not only in its breadth in space but for its duration intime.This scenario would also imply the following types of corroborating evidence:> 1. The presence of anomalous features on the planets Mars, and the Moons of> Jupiter and Saturn, suggesting an artificial origin since the texts as studied> in pervious chapters indicate the involvement of these planets in the war and> its resulting destruction;> 2. The presence of anomalous features on the Earth’s Moon suggesting a similar> artificial origin;> 3. Moreover, these features, if their artificial nature is established, should> in turn indicate a common cultural origin and technology, i.e., they should be> similar in appearance;> 4. Following the suggestions of the Mesopotamian and Biblical traditions,> there should be evidence of the chimerical, giant offspring of the unions of> the “gods” and humans, a point already explored in chapter four;> 5. There should also be evidence of the antiquity of mankind on earth prior to> the standard theories of human origins, and/or evidence of the presence of> intelligent life on earth in great antiquity;> 6. There should be evidence of the existence of a weaponizable physics capable> of wreaking planetary-wide damage and of destroying a planet in its entirety,> a point which has already been argued; and finally,> 7. There should be evidence of intentional destruction on the surfaces of the> above planets, or at the minimum, evidence of anomalous patterns of> destruction on those planets. This list does not change significantly if one takes the alternative dates ofthe scenario, based on the event of 3,200,000 years ago being the main event.If, however, one takes my suggestion that the event at 3,200,000 years ago wasthe main event, as Van Flanden himself initially proposed, and that a K/T-likeboundary layer is missing from the earth simply due to its distance from thatexplosion, then the above chronology is modified accordingly. In this case,while the celestial mechanics become much more improbable, the scenario wouldseem to square with the chronology suggested by the mythological texts whichalways seem to imply human observers to the events, and early mankind begins toemerge circa this time frame according to the standard theories.Either way one wishes to view the chronological problem, however, one thingshould now be abundantly clear, and that is that the ancient traditions of acosmic war and the implications of the Multiple Exploded Planet Hypothesis fittogether with enough exactitude to allow this set of corroborative evidence tobe constructed. The likelihood of the cosmic war hypothesis consequentlyincreases with the fulfillment of each of the seven above criteria ofcorroborative evidences.But one serious question remains."},{"pageContent":"2. ANGELS AND PLASMA LIFE? This serious question is the clear implication found in the Mesopotamian, theEgyptian (Edfu), and the Biblical traditions that the “gods” are “spirits”,i.e., incorporeal and non-material in nature. They are, in short, a verydifferent form of intelligent life than the humanoid “giants,” Nephilim, andhumans themselves, that we have discussed thus far. And as I have observedelsewhere,578 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1174618] theproblem is compounded by the fact that in the Mesopotamian and Biblicaltraditions, these “gods” or “sons of God” marry humans and sire chimericaloffspring from them.Traditionally, Christian theology has maintained that the angels, and byimplication demons, are beings of “light” and thus not inhibited by the normalconstraints of space and time. They are, so to speak, a sort of“hyper-dimensional” life form able to “slow down” long enough to manifestthemselves corporeally, materially, and locally, and thus presumably, to sireoffspring of humans.579[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1174810] This whole approachhas often been sarcastically portrayed in the popular imagination as a debate on“how many angels can fit on the head of a pin,” when in fact its profoundcharacter as a speculation in theoretical physics and its implications foralternative life forms has gone entirely unnoticed.But the theological conjectures of an earlier age might not be so easilydismissed. In fact, they find rather strange corroboration from the plasmaphysics community, for the famous quantum and plasma physicist David Bohm oncenoted that the behavior of electrons in plasma gave him the impression that theywere somehow alive, since they exhibited the kind of self-organizing propertiesin plasma that one normally associated with life. More recently, an even moresuggestive connection between plasmas and life appeared to have beendemonstrated by physicists who were able to create plasmas that grew,replicated, and communicated information to each other.580[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1176588] This fulfills threeout of the four main criteria that many list for the presence of life. The majordistinction between such plasmas and ordinary life is that ordinary liferequires the presence of inherited material from the parent to the child. Thisis eerily reminiscent of the statement by Christ in the New Testament thatangels neither marry nor are given in marriage. One is permitted to speculatethat perhaps plasmas are able to communicate or imprint information almosttotally on another plasma. By implication, this would enable them to do so inany interface with more organically based life. In the case of the evilintentions of “fallen angelic ‘plasmas’” this would manifest itself as anhabitual inclination toward evil, recalling our speculations concerning animpressed dynamic of evil on the Tablets of Destinies, explaining theirconsistent and persistent association in the texts with the cosmic war in thepantheon.581 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1176831]"},{"pageContent":"B. MORE MISCELLANEOUS CLUES:"},{"pageContent":"1. SERPENT GODS AND DRAGON PEOPLE Lucifer is, of course, usually understood by the Judeo-Christian tradition to bethe serpent referred to in the Genesis three account of the fall of man. Hisdescription as the “wisest” and “most cunning” of all the creatures - as well ashis promise to mankind that if it but eats of the “forbidden fruit” of the treeof the knowledge of good and evil - has led some commentators to draw parallelsbetween him and the “civilizing” and “wisdom” gods of other cultures, the godswho taught mankind the arts and sciences of civilization. The Mayan-Aztec godQuetzlcoatl, who is credited with teaching them their civilization, is said tohave been a bearded white man, but is also, as is well-known, depicted as a“feathered serpent” or a “winged serpent.” Similarly the Incan Viracocha was abearded white man, and also a “feathered” or “winged” serpent. The Egyptian“wisdom god” Thoth, who is also credited with building the Great Pyramid, isalso associated with a lizard, the salamander.

SUMMARY: A CATALOGUE OF CLUES A broad mythological context has now been assembled from which to view thecosmic war that, when viewed with the evidences presented in part one,constitute a prima facie case that this war was literal and real and not merelya metaphor for the explosions of planets brought about by collisions betweencelestial bodies, as various schools of catastrophism would have it. Among thesethe following points should be stressed:> 1. The broad outlines of this war involved the planetary systems of the> Earth-Moon, Mars (and by implication its satellites Phobos and Deimos),> Jupiter and its satellites; Saturn and its satellites, the now missing and> exploded planet(s) and its satellite, which was probably Mars, and the Sun> itself.> 2.

As a result of this constellation of relationships, we may observe that the warappears to have been, at the minimum, between the following parts of thisancient civilization: on the one hand, Mars, the missing planet “Tiamat” orKrypton, and possibly some areas of the Moon and the Earth; and on the otherhand, Jupiter, Saturn, their satellites, the Sun, and parts of the Moon and theEarth on the other. Earth and the Moon would, therefore, appear to be dividedbetween the two factions, and thus possibly be one point of contention betweenthem, and perhaps even the central point.From this reading of the scenario, then, the “Flood” itself appears to be yetanother example of the “Unified Intention of Symbol,” since many such planetary-and regional-wide floods appear to be in view: (1) the Flood on Mars thatresulted from the explosion of “Tiamat-Krypton” and, as the shock wave traveledfurther, similar damage to Earth; (2) subsequently the regional floods thatrecurred periodically on the Earth. The same would apply for the “Noah motiffound especially in Sumerian and biblical literature. However, an interestingdistinction between the two should be noted.It is often pointed out by biblical scholars and Sumerologists that there is aclear similarity between the biblical story of Noah and that of the Sumerianflood epic and its heroes Utnapishtim and Gilgamesh. But there is an importantdistinction that might indicate that these two stories are referring todifferent floods: the Sumerian account clearly contains a reference to itsheroes being able to view the entire Earth from a point in space above it, andthis implies a space-faring technology. Thus, the Sumerian account might bereferencing a “Noah” episode that concerns a planet other than the Earth, onethat was concussed by a sudden planet-wide flood. The best candidate, of course,is Mars. The Biblical account, conversely, is squarely set on the Earthexclusively. While there are similarities in the accounts, therefore, it is mybelief that they refer to separate events, or perhaps to a Space/Mars-basedframe of reference as distinct from an Earth-based frame of reference for thesame event. One might, in this case also, be in the presence once again of theUnified Intention of Symbol. In either case, if one is positing a sophisticatedancient society of this interplanetary nature, with a physics sufficient tofight a war and wreak destruction on a planetary scale, one is also positing acivilization with a sophistication sufficient to the genetic manipulationssuggested by those same texts. In this light, the “ark” would appear to be lessa boat packed with adult animals, than it would a container of DNA samples.With these ideas in mind, we may now turn our attention to the planetsthemselves, seeking confirming clues that they may once have been the homes of along-lost, advanced civilization, and the battlefields of a very ancient, cosmicwar."},{"pageContent":"PART THREE: EXTERNAL EVIDENCES: THE EARTH, THE MOON, MARS, AND SATURN “Cremo and Thompson ’s central proposition is that the model of humanprehistory, carefully built-up by scholars over the past two centuries, is sadlyand completely wrong.

Moreover, thisevidence would also of necessity have to suggest the type of destructionassociated with a war, and with the types of scalar, plasma, and nuclear typesof weapons that those texts suggest.Our focus here is, obviously, the Moon. Many people state that they have neverseen a UFO. But, as we shall see, one of the most unexplained “flying objects”in the skies over our heads is precisely the Moon. It is, in a way, the largest,most obvious flying saucer, and by the same token it is therefore also thelargest, most blatant challenge to the assumptions of “normal science” and thevarious paradigms of explanation and the models it engenders, for almost nothingabout the Moon makes any sense if viewed from the standpoint of those very sameparadigms and models. Our concentration will be on five principle areas of data:(1) How did it Get There? (2) LTPs, or Lunar Transient Phenomena, (3) Shards,Cuspids, and Towers versus “Incessant Meteoric Bombardment,” (4) its ability to“ring like a bell” and its implications, and finally (5) Strange Possibilitiesof Deliberate Destruction."},{"pageContent":"A. HOW DID IT GET THERE? The most obvious difficulty that the Moon presents is simply its presence, sinceby any reckoning it is just too massive for such a small parent planet as theEarth. This has prompted a variety of models to explain its origin, which may bereduced to two broad theories: the “planetary fission” model and the “capture”model."},{"pageContent":"1. THE PLANETARY FISSION MODEL One theory, favored in the pre-Apollo era, was that the Moon and the Earth“fissioned” or split apart in the early years of the planets’ formation, withthe Moon emerging from what is now the Pacific basin, and settling into itscurrent orbit. This would entail enormous difficulties of celestial mechanicsthat simply pile up too many coincidences. For example, the Moon exists in anearly perfect circular orbit around the Earth, an orbit that, moreover, allowsonly about 60% of the Moon’s surface — the same side — to be visible from theEarth, even though the Moon, like the Earth, rotates around its own axis.Additionally, the Moon exists at the precise distance from the Earth that allowsit to totally eclipse the Sun. A “fission” model would, moreover, imply that theMoon’s orbital mechanics around the Earth would of necessity be rather moreelliptical than they are.But there is a final difficulty, one that proved fatal to the “fission” modelafter the first Apollo Moon landings returned with rocks from our celestialneighbor. For the fission model to be true, the age of rocks on the Moon wouldhave to be of similar antiquity to the Earth itself, yet rocks and soil werediscovered on the Moon that were some billions of years older. The oldest rocksfound on Earth are some 3.7 billions of years old, while rocks returned from theApollo missions dated from 4.3 to 4.6 billions of years old, while one rock evendated to some 5.3 billions of years old. This fact is made the more curiousbecause the area of the Moon from whence they originated was thought to be oneof the geologically youngest on that planet!"},{"pageContent":"2. THE CAPTURE MODEL With the death of the “fission” model, scientists were led to posit a “capture”model for its origin. In one version of this theory, the Earth and the Moonevolved into their current double-planet system from the same primordial spacedust in the early formative years of the solar system. However, for this modelto be true the age of rocks from the two planets would again have to be similar,and here again, the Apollo moon rocks simply exhibited too great of an agedisparity for this model to be correct.This led to the second, and now regnant, theory of “capture” to be adopted.According to this theory, the Moon was “captured” by the Earth’s gravity as itwandered too close, and became a permanent satellite of the Earth.The problem with this model is, once again, the physics simply does not work,for in addition to piling up all the previously mentioned mechanical“coincidences” a further problem is encountered. This is the idea of “capture”itself, a phenomenon used, in fact, by the Russian and European space agencies,and by NASA itself, in launching deep space probes to the other planets of thesolar system. Using another planet’s gravity well, these probes are steeredclose enough to these planets to “slingshot” them to even more distances. As theprobes enter a planet’s gravitational attraction, they accelerate and thusslingshot by the planet, able to gain speed for their outward journey.And so the Moon, if it was captured would have to accelerate as it entered thegravitational pull of the Earth, and this in turn would inevitably have led toan elongated and elliptical orbit. But this is not what millennia ofobservations have shown. Since the Moon is apparently older than the Earth, itstands to reason that the capture model is correct in its basic outline.However, no known mechanism can account for its current orbital mechanics. Inshort, it would appear that the Moon had to have been “braked” as it enteredEarth orbit, and in such a fashion as to assume its current position. As noknown naturalist mechanism exists to explain such “braking,” the only otherexplanation would appear that it had been intelligently guided to its currentposition. It is a celestial mechanics analogue to parallel parking a car.Briefly stated, the Moon was parked. And that implies a pilot.This catalogue of facts led two Soviet scientists to propose in the 1970s forthe Soviet magazine Sputnik that the Moon was, in fact, a gigantic artificialspaceship. But there were other anomalies about the Moon, first revealed duringthe initial days of the space race between the United States and the SovietUnion, and continuing all the way up through the Apollo moon landings."},{"pageContent":"B. APOLLO ANOMALIES"},{"pageContent":"1. PREVIOUS SOVIET AND AMERICAN PROBES One of the most interesting aspects of the lunar anomalies is the strangebehavior of early Soviet and American unmanned probes to the planet. TheRussians were the first to the Moon with an unmanned probe, another first intheir long line of early space firsts; Luna 1 reached the Moon on a “fly-by”mission in 1959, coming to within about 4500 miles of the Moon’s surface.This was followed by Luna 2, which was the first man-made object to actually hitthe moon. This probe was not designed to survive the impact on the Moon’ssurface. Things suddenly changed, however, with the Luna 3 probe.Luna 3 was the first man-made satellite to circle around to the far side of theMoon, where it was also the first to take pictures of that side of the Moon.Strangely, and as far as is publicly known, the Soviet Union ceased all lunarexploration for a full four years after Luna 3, and the probe’s pictures were aclosely held secret.Meanwhile, the United States was late getting to the Moon, and its early probeswere not very successful. Ranger 3, which was launched in 1962, so completelymissed the Moon that it wound up in orbit around the Sun. Ranger 4 struck theMoon, but returned little useful information. Ranger 5 missed the Moon by awhopping 450 miles.When the Soviet Union revived its lunar exploration in 1964 with Luna 5, thecraft crashed into the Moon at full speed when it had been designed for a softlunar landing. Luna 6 was even less successful, missing the moon completely.Like Luna 5, Luna 7 crashed into the Moon, a result of its retro-rockets havingfired too early. This point is highly significant, as will be seen momentarily.Luna 8 also crashed, but finally the Russians were successful with Luna 9, whichwas able to soft land on the Moon, the first man-made spacecraft to do so. It isalso noteworthy that after Luna 9, both Russian and American success rates ofattempts to land probes on the Moon improved."},{"pageContent":"2. THE EQUIGRAVISPHERE AND OTHER GRAVITATIONAL PROBLEMS Why were the early Soviet and American attempts to orbit or land probes on theMoon so unsuccessful? Clearly neither the Russians nor the Americans lacked themathematical talent to calculate a proper trajectory for spacecraft going to theMoon, unless there was some hidden problem that made accurate calculationserroneous. As an example of this problem, many have pointed out that Dr. WernerVon Braun let slip an interesting piece of information after the firstsuccessful Apollo landing, in an interview to Time magazine in 1969. In theinterview, Von Braun revealed that the neutral point for the gravitationalattraction between the Earth and the Moon was approximately 43,500 miles fromthe lunar surface. This was over twenty thousand miles further away from thesurface of the Moon if the Moon were only 1/6th of the gravitational attractionof the Earth.Yet another problem was revealed during these early space probes and thesubsequent Apollo missions. Orbiting spacecraft would suddenly “dip” andaccelerate over certain very localized areas of the lunar surface, those areasprecisely known as the lunar “maria” or “seas,” the dark glassy areas of theMoon found only on the side facing the Earth. These concentrations of heavy masswere called appropriately enough “mascons,” and they could only mean that therewas present beneath the lunar surface in these areas dense concentrations ofsome very heavy matter. Yet, no naturalistic explanation has yet been advancedfor these formations that can account for their presence through randomprocesses.But the final gravitational anomaly may be the most significant one, and that isthe anomaly related to the Russian space probe Luna 7’s early firing of itsretro-rockets. It was natural for the Russians to assume that the Moon was asolid, homogeneous “rock” floating in space. In these circumstances,retro-rockets may be fired fairly early. But if the Moon were not a “solid rock”floating in space, but was either of greatly differing densities of material onits interior, or even worse, hollow, then this would change everything.Retro-rockets would have to fire later and burn faster.The reason is relatively simple. If the Moon was a solid rock, then the centerof gravity is farther away from the surface one is landing on, and hence, onemay fire retro-rockets earlier, and burned at a slower rate. Conversely, if theMoon is hollow, the center of gravity shifts towards the surface one wishes toland on, and thus one would fire retro-rockets later and burn them faster inorder to effect a soft landing. Indeed, in the July 1982 issue of Atsronauticsmagazine, Dr. Gordon McDonald of NASA actually reported that a NASA study of theMoon’s motion revealed that it moved more like a hollow object than a solid one,i.e., that the material in its interior was much less dense than that toward itssurface.592 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1179041]So gravitationally, the Moon is almost completely unlike any other celestialobject man has encountered. Even if one does not accept the possibility that itsgravity might be much more then the 1/6th gravity that prevailed before VonBraun’s significant revelation about the distance of the neutral point betweenthe Earth and the Moon, one is still left with the difficulties of physicalmechanics that the Earth should even have such a large satellite based on arandom “capture” of a passing celestial body, much less have it in precisely theperfectly “circular” orbit that it has. The gravitational problem of such acapture is further enhanced by the presence of the anomalous regions of greatermass concentrations beneath the maria, the “mascons,” for their presence wouldmake any such “capture” somewhat “wobbly.” And finally, there is the problem ofall those early space probes, careening wildly by the Moon, or, retro-rocketsfiring as if to soft land on a solid rock, and instead crashing straight intoit.This led two Soviet scientists to draw what was by then an obvious, but veryuncomfortable, conclusion: the Moon was not a planet in any normal sense at all.It was an artificial body. It was a gigantic spaceship. This idea became, infact, the subject of a “UFO classic” in the 1970’s in a book by Don Wilsoncalled Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon. The book contains a goldmine of details onstrange lunar anomalies, and, in spite of its popularity, has never beenrepublished.In any case, if this “spaceship Moon” hypothesis were ever to be confirmed,however, its relevance to the Cosmic War hypothesis and scenario outlined hereis rather obvious, for a civilization in possession of a physics and technologycapable of wreaking giant regional scarring on the surfaces of planets, or ofexploding one, would likely also be capable of other similarly huge“mega-engineering” projects. But even if, as is much more likely, the Moon isnot an artificial body, it still contains sufficient anomalies to suggest thatit may once have been an outpost of the civilization that waged that cosmic war.And the problem of how it got there remains."},{"pageContent":"3. MISSION TO GROUND TRANSMISSIONS An odd confirmation of this has been the strange radio signals coming from theMoon and its vicinity. In fact, the radio transmissions were not the onlystrange things man encountered in the beginning years of space exploration. Itis well known that Project Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper never made it asecret that he had spotted a UFO during his Faith 7 Mercury mission. The objectwas also seen by over 200 people at Muchea tracking station near Perth,Australia. Additionally, Cooper maintained that he heard radio voicetransmissions in an “unintelligible foreign language.” According to Don Wilsonof Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon once again, the tapes of these signals werereplayed by NASA and analyzed, but no known human language could ever beidentified as the language on the transmissions.593[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1179233]Even earlier, in 1956, the University of Ohio and other Moon-watchinginstitutions reported that there was strange “codelike radio chatter” comingfrom the Moon. And in October of 1958, American, British, and Russianastronomers all reported observing something speeding toward the Moon at 25,000miles an hour, emitting radio signals that, once again, no one couldinterpret.594 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1179429]Once mankind did reach the Moon with the Apollo landings, the radio chatter —this time man’s own radio chatter - became even more suggestive.

What interests us is the clear referenceby the astronauts to switch to what are apparently secure frequencies for theircommunications. This clearly would imply that they saw something that did notbelong there, although it need not be a UFO. Whatever they saw, it does not makemuch sense that they would have gone to secure frequencies merely to continue aconversation about the Russian Vostok probe.Exactly what they might have seen may be indicated by the transcripts of aconversation held between mission Ground Control (designated CAPCOM here) andastronauts Duke and Young on the Moon’s surface:> DUKE: These devices are unbelievable.

We will return to this theme of twospace programs and a hidden agenda in a subsequent chapter."},{"pageContent":"4. APOLLO 18 AND 19 Perhaps the strangest anomaly of them all is the fact that, having spent so muchtime, treasure, and thought on reaching the Moon, the last two Apollo missionswere suddenly and by any account mysteriously cancelled. Altogether, there weresupposed to have been ten lunar flights, and the Apollo 18 and 19 rockets were“already paid for and the astronauts trained and raring to go.”603[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1181125] Why then were thesealready-paid for missions scrubbed? The standard explanation has always beenthat the final four Apollo missions were cancelled for budgetary reasons. Butthis cannot be the explanation for canceling Apollo 18 and 19 for these, as hasbeen noted, were already paid for. Some other reason must lie at the core of themystery, but whatever it is, the American government and NASA are not talking.Perhaps, as some UFOlogists assert, we were “warned” not to return by someonewho did not like our presence there. Or perhaps, too, we found whatever it waswe were looking for."},{"pageContent":"5. LEAPING ON THE MOON: AN ESOTERIC SYMBOLISM Prior to the Apollo missions, it was an item of popular discussion to imaginethe fantastic athletic feats that man could accomplish on the moon. Why, in1/6th the gravity, a 180 pound man would weigh only 30 pounds. He would be ableto leap much taller, run faster and farther, hit golf balls off the tee for amile. This line of discussion was hammered home in children’s Weekly Readers inschools, in television and film documentaries, in science fiction movies andnovels, on late night talk show monologues and in almost every way conceivable.By the time of the Apollo missions, we were well-prepared to see some trulystupendous things.But as William Brian II notes, we saw no such fantastic feats as we were gluedto our television sets watching Apollo astronauts on mission after missionleaping around on the lunar surface.> Even with the astronaut gear....(Apollo 16 astronaut John Young) should have> been able to jump over six feet off the ground if the Moon had one-sixth of> the Earth’s gravity.

But in fact,the small heights achieved by the leaping astronauts on all those Apollolandings in my opinion is a strong indicator that we went, and that, in thisinstance at least, NASA concealed nothing. Had NASA wished to hoax the missionson a television stage or film set, it is hardly likely that it would haveoverlooked the obvious implications of leaps from astronauts that were far tooshort for a Moon with 1/6th the gravity of the Earth. So why the leaping at all?Why show everyone on Earth in the plainest possible fashion that the Moon is amuch more massive object than our pre-Apollo science had led us to believe?I believe in part that the answer to this lies in the fact that, if the Moon ismore massive, then the likelihood of us getting off the Moon by means of thesmall rockets on the Lunar Excursion Module is very small. Rockets may have beenadequate to the task of getting us there, but if, as our and the Soviets’earlier probe failures had already indicated, the Moon’s gravity was alreadyknown to be more massive, then the leaping is a subtle but nevertheless definitesignal that some other technology may have been in play in getting us off theMoon.605 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1181545]But there may be another message altogether in the leaping exercises of theastronauts on the Moon, a message heavy with esoteric significance: leaping isassociated with Mars, the “Great Leaping One” of so much esoteric literature.Indeed, the imperial Roman Salii priests who celebrated Rome’s foundingrelationship with Mars did so by blowing trumpets and leaping.606[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1181759] So perhaps theleaping of the astronauts is designed to convey both a scientific significance,and a ritual one. In this respect, it has often been pointed out that many ofthe Apollo astronauts were Masons, and actually took Masonic regalia with themon their Moon missions to perform Masonic rites on the lunar surface, rites thatwere never broadcast to the public. And as Face-on-Mars exponent Richard C.Hoagland has often pointed out, many of the space missions of NASA are oddlyscheduled so as to fulfill certain astrological and celestial alignments.It is not only the behavior of the Moon that is odd, it is also the behavior ofour astronauts on it."},{"pageContent":"C. LTPS: LUNAR TRANSIENT PHENOMENA AND THE PRE-APOLLO TOP SECRET TELESCOPEPROGRAM Anomalous behavior has been observed about the Moon ever since man first trainedtelescopes on it and began keeping accurate records of observations. One of thestrangest facts about the Moon are the surface features that are there at onetime, and not at another, or which disappear slowly over time, or conversely,emerge over time. One of the most famous instances is the case of thedisappearing crater named Linne. First observed by the German astronomer JohannSchroeter in 1843, Linne was estimated to be some six miles in diameter andapproximately 1200 feet deep. During the course of several years’ observationsand careful lunar map-making, Schroeter eventually saw Linne disappear almostcompletely.607 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1182001]Other astronomers have periodically reported seeing lights in the crater Plato,which then disappear, only to reappear again some time later. Other suchchanging phenomena, called Lunar Transient Phenomena or LTPs for short, areinexplicable changes in the color of the Moon’s surface, dark spots that appearand disappear, and so on.Then came 1953 and famed astronomer and selenologist Dr. H. P. Wilkins’s, of“domes” that began to appear on the surface of the Moon. This was not the onlyproblem. Wilkins also noted> That their number had been increasing rapidly. Similar reports were made by> many expert observers. Wilkins could not explain their sudden appearance.> Neither could other astronomers, for the newly discovered domes were near the> limits of telescopic resolution, and the blurred features prevented positive> conclusions. However, something was definitely responsible for the appearance> of more then 200 strange domes. 608> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1182193] Indeed, as author David Hatcher Childress points out in his bookExtraterrestrial Archeology, one of Apollo 15’s precise mission objectives wasfor the astronauts to “describe the domes in the mare material and theirprobable origin.”609 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1182449] An Example of a Lunar Dome, Visible just above the Arrow in the Crater towardthe top center of the picture.051 [images/00051.jpg] The observation of these domes and other transient phenomena by such respectedastronomers and Wilkins apparently set off some sort of alarm in theintelligence corridors of Washington DC, for the Pentagon shortly thereafterbegan various programs to have the larger telescopes, such as at Mount Palomar,photograph the surface of the Moon in detail. These studies were classified TopSecret.610 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1183003] Lunaranomalies had become subject to national security guidelines.611[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1183216] The year 1953 issignificant, of course, for being the year following the infamous Washington DC,US Capitol UFO Flap of 1952, in which UFOs were seen on radar by Americanmilitary personnel, seen visually over the US capital city, and chased byscrambled American Air Force fighter jets. This activity came at the end of amajor period of UFO activity dating from just before the end of World War Two,with the famous “Foo Fighter” incidents over Nazi Germany in late 1944, to theperiod immediately surrounding the Kenneth Arnold and Roswell episodes of 1947.Thus, when Lunar Transient Phenomena suggestive of an artificial origin, like“domes,” were observed, catalogued, and reported by someone of Wilkin’sprestige, and confirmed by other reputable astronomers from all over the world,the American military, nerves already on edge with endless UFO activity, wasbound to sit up and take notice. Since 1953, as author Daniel Ross observes,> The National Security Agency had been behind the official censorship of> information concerning UFOs, and now it was equally necessary for them to> clamp down security regarding any proof of alien operations on the Moon. By> 1954, the guidelines and restrictions were set, regarding any photographic> studies or announcements by the big observatories concerning the Moon....> Planetary studies of the Moon, Mars, and Venus, that had the capability of> disproving the uninhabitable theories, were now a matter of national> security.612 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1183366] In other words, any data or information that indicated that Earth’s closestneighbors might be inhabited had to be suppressed. But there is more to thisagenda than just this, for it also meant that any data that suggested planetaryenvironments on Earth’s nearest neighbors even remotely conducive tohabitability had also to be suppressed. And one must assume that the subsequentrecommendations of the Brookings Report to withhold any evidence of pasthabitation on those planets also fell under that 1953 national security rubric.Against this backdrop the strange coded language of some of the Apollotransmissions previously cited makes sense, for it is indicative of the sametypes of security protocols in place on the Apollo missions as were present inthe telescopic studies and mappings of the 1950s. And that in turn would meanthat they did indeed see “something” up there.Following the same line of reasoning, it would perhaps also fall within thebrief of these intelligence agencies to suppress any evidence of aninterplanetary war that once occurred on these planets, for such evidence wouldalso imply the existence of a technology. And perhaps this, ultimately, is thereason for the hidden military presence throughout the space program."},{"pageContent":"D. SHARDS, OCTAGONS, CRATERS, AND TOWERS VERSUS “INCESSANT METEORIC BOMBARDMENT” The surface of the Moon boasts a number of features suggestive of an artificialorigin for themselves, and possibly for the Moon as a whole.One of the strangest of these is the so-called “Shard” located south west of theSinus Medii region of the Moon. The photo is from the Lunar Orbiter frameIII-84M. The shadow of the object is clearly visible extending from the bottomof the structure to the lower right hand comer of the picture. The strange“star-like’ light on the top of the structure is a camera registration mark andnot actually a part of the structure. The Sinus Medii “Shard” on the Moon052 [images/00052.jpg] However, why call this strange object a “structure” at all? For one thing, itstretches some one and a half miles above the surface of the Moon. It is, inother words, enormous. But the fact that it is there are all raises certainquestions. According to the standard model, the Moon is supposedly subjected toan unceasing rain of meteors, a “bombardment” that would batter down sharp edgesand jagged mountains into smooth, rounded hills over the billions of years theMoon has existed. Yet, there it stands, with its strangely regular “twisted” or“spiral” geometry. The object not only exists, in spite of this unceasingmeteoric rain, but it has preserved some apparently basic, structural geometry.Yet another odd feature not explainable by the standard “meteoric bombardment”model are the presence on the surface of the Moon of craters and other oddlyrectilinear formations, formations almost impossible to explain on the basis ofnatural geological processes, much less those of meteoric bombardment. Forexample, how would one explain the origin of the oddly rectilinear polygons inthe following photograph?053 [images/00053.jpg] Note in particular the two very tiny pyramidal like objects in the left centerof the picture. But most importantly, how would one explain the octagonal“crater” toward the bottom center? The meteoric bombardment is obvious from thepicture. By the same token however, the rectilinear polygon shapes of some ofthese “craters” suggests the presence of an underlying structure and order.Similar rectilinear structure is found in the following photo. “Pie Slice” on the Moon054 [images/00054.jpg] Note the pie “slice” cut to the left center of the picture, the “tower” likeobject immediately above it, and the two “double craters” to the right side ofthe picture. Again, meteoric bombardment over billions of years should haveobliterated such features long ago. And no known geological mechanism would seemto account for such neat and precise regularity. The presence of such featuresonce again seems to suggest an artificial origin."},{"pageContent":"1. VARIOUS EXPLANATIONS FOR SHALLOW CRATERS But even the vast majority of craters on the Moon which obviously are the resultof the impact on its surface of space debris have a problem. Depending on thesize and velocity of the meteor, the impact crater it leaves behind will vary inthe depth of the crater. Thus, one would expect that the largest craters wouldhave, by comparison, a relatively greater depth. Thus, the most familiar featureof the Moon, its many craters, some of them quite large, are ironically the mostanomalous features of them all, octagons, pyramids, domes, shards and pie slicesnotwithstanding.> Despite their fantastic size, even the largest gaping holes are surprisingly> shallow.

Weirder still is the fact that the floor of the crater is convex,following the curvature of the Moon’s surface, rather than concave.614[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1183794]The mechanism most familiar to current science that can cause such shallowcraters are ...thermonuclear explosions."},{"pageContent":"2. DOUBLE CRATERING Another odd feature of lunar craters was noticed by Richard C. Hoagland, afterpouring over Moon photographs. This was the occurrence of “double craters,”craters in close proximity to each other, having the same size, and more or lessthe same directional orientation. Meteoric bombardment over billions of yearsmight explain some of these, but not their fairly frequent occurrence on theMoon. Briefly put, the presence of such phenomena is suggestive of deliberatetargeting, not random bombardment by meteors."},{"pageContent":"E. IT RINGS, TOO! A “superhard” layer of material beneath the surface of the Moon impervious todeep penetration by meteors; dense, localized areas of strong localized gravitycausing orbiting satellites to “dip” and accelerate; enormously tall “shards”projecting out from the lunar surface in defiance of the meteoric bombardment;“pie slices” and other anomalously rectilinear formations on the surface;gravitational anomalies and shallow craters, suggesting the Moon is “hollow,” orat the minimum has an interior core of much less dense material than thattowards its surface, a model itself at variance with standard models of theinteriors of solid planets: all this suggests that the Moon, if not anartificial body in its own right, at least has some elements on and beneath itssurface that are artificial in nature.Confirmation of the “hollow Moon” idea came in a dramatic and unexpected fashionwhen the Lunar Module ascent stage of Apollo 12 was jettisoned from the CommandModule after depositing the two astronauts on board for their return journey toEarth. The ascent stage was sent crashing back into the Moon where specialseismographic equipment left on its surface recorded the shock waves and radioedthem back to earth. The results “staggered NASA scientists. The artificiallycreated Moonquake lasted 55 minutes!”615[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1183943] But this was notall. Scientists were baffled by the type of signals that were recorded. Thewaves started small, then gained in size to a peak, lasted “for unbelievablylong periods of time.” This is completely different behavior from seismic wavesgenerated on the Earth.616[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1184128] Subsequentexperiments with components from the failed Apollo 13 mission, and later fromApollo 14, generated Moonquakes that lasted for about 3 hours and 20 minutes ineach case, with the waves in each case traveling to a depth of 22-25 miles.617[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1184269]There was a further puzzle to the Moonquakes. Werner Von Braun reveled toPopular Science magazine in January of 1972 that the velocity of the wavesgradually increased to a depth beneath the lunar surface of about 15 miles,whereupon there was a sudden increase, an increase only possible if the materialbecame suddenly much denser. Around 40 miles beneath the surface the velocity ofthe waves was about 6 miles per second.618[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1184410] The outer maria ofthe Moon were composed of a mixture or metals, some of them very rare: iron,titanium, beryllium, molybdenum, and yttrium. It is perhaps significant that thevelocity of sound through such material is approximately the same: about sixmiles per second. This suggests that deep beneath the lunar surface there is athick layer of what can only be described as a “specially alloyed” compound ofthese rare metals.This would explain why the Moon, to the shock of the scientists performing theseexperiments, rang like a bell.Rounding out this picture of high lunar strangeness are the curious featuresnoted about some of the moon rocks brought back by Apollo, and also by Sovietunmanned probes. Apollo 16 brought back samples of Moon rocks that containedrusted iron, an impossibility without the presence of free oxygen andhydrogen.619 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1184664] But theAugust 26, 1976 edition of the Detroit Free Press carried a short article fromthe Associated Press wire service about a startling Russian announcement. TheRussians, it seemed, had discovered their own particles of lunar iron returnedto the Soviet Union in one of their probes. The iron could not, did not, andwould not rust. As the newspaper noted, such “rustless” iron cannot bemanufactured on Earth” and yet, to be rustless, some sort of manufacturingprocess has to be involved.620[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1184819] The only other placesuch rustless iron is known is the iron column in New Delhi, India, thought tobe incomparably old and also, like the lunar rustless iron, this pole does notrust, though it has stood outside enduring monsoon after monsoon.Finally, lunar soil and rock samples that were brought back to Earth by Apollo12 and 14 contained traces of Uranium 236 and Neptunium 237, isotopes that were“never previously found in nature.”621[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1184971] Of course suchisotopes may be synthesized, but that is the point: prior to the Apollo missionsthey had to be synthesized."},{"pageContent":"F. APOLLO 12 AND 13 AND OTHER MOON MISCELLANIES This excursion into lunar anomalies would not be complete without mention of theApollo 12 and 13 missions, and their very near disastrous outcomes. Apollo 12was only the second of man’s flights to land on the Moon, lifting off from Earthin November of 1969. However, less than a minute after lift-off the craft wasstruck by lightning when it was barely a mile and a half above Earth. All itselectrical systems were shut down. The astronauts — Charles Conrad, Dick Gordon,and Allan Bean — worked calmly and restored all the craft’s electrical power andsystems.622 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1185163] Theorigin of the lightning bolt was a mystery, since the nearest weather reports oflightning were some twenty miles distant.623[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1185311]Then, while on the way to the Moon, observatories from around the world reportedseeing flashing lights both leading and trailing the spaceship. The day afterlift off, November 15, 1969, the three astronauts radioed Mission Control thatthey also had spotted the “bogeys,” i.e., the UFOs. 624[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1185452]The Apollo 12 lightning-UFO episode has led some UFOlogists and others tospeculate that someone was trying halt manned missions to the Moon and, havingfailed to do so, traveled along with it to keep a close eye on things. Whilepossible, another explanation would be that the Soviet Union might have beenusing some of its own Tesla weaponry to stop the missions.An even more chilling rumor was related by NASA insider and engineer MauriceChatelain regarding the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission. Chatelain maintained> That there was a lot of talk and speculation within the space agency about the> unsuccessful mission. It seems that Apollo 13 was carrying a secret payload -> a nuclear device that was to be detonated on the Moon’s surface. The nuclear> test would be measured by the seismographic packages left on the surface at> the two previous Apollo sites, in order to determine the infrastructure> properties of the Moon.

And at the maximum, all the strange featuresof the Moon’s gravitational pull, its almost impossible-to-account-for celestialmechanics in its orbit around the Earth, its oddly shallow craters, the apparentpresence miles beneath its surface of a hard metallic “inner crust”, and itsability to “ring like a bell,” may point to the whole planet being a giganticartificial structure.Something else has emerged from all this as well, and that is the persistentpresence within the space program - from the first days of organized observationof the lunar surface by the Pentagon and the various intelligence agencies in1953, to the heavy presence within the astronaut corps itself - of the military.It has been suggested in this chapter that one possible reason for this heavymilitary presence in the initial days of space exploration, was to suppress anydata that indicated former or current habitation of our nearby celestialneighbors. A reason for this was also suggested, and that is that the “hidden”space programs of the United States and the Soviet Union may have been not onlyto suppress evidences of an ancient war, but also to possibly recover thetechnology that made that war possible.This last possibility - that of covering up evidence of an ancient war whilesimultaneously seeking to recover some of the lost technology of that war - willloom as an even larger possibility in the next chapter."},{"pageContent":"14.

Hoagland626[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1185807] Along with the Moon, Mars is without doubt the planet that has the most hold onthe human imagination. Its persistent association with war and destructionwithin astrological lore goes back as far as recorded human memory extends. Andever since the Viking Mars probe took its famous picture of the Sphinx-like Faceon the surface of that planet’s Cydonia region, it has become the focus of aprotracted debate between “Face believers” and “Face debunkers.” Previouschapters have shown that, in so far as ancient myth is concerned, Mars and itsruler(s) was a definite and decisive player in the ancient Cosmic War.Accordingly, one may look for anomalous objects on the surface of Mars, forcorroboration of the idea that there was once a civilization there, and one maylook also for evidence that at least some of Mars may have undergone deliberatedestruction. However, since the whole Cydonia-Face controversy has engendered somuch debate, nothing will be said about it here except toward the end of thischapter. Here our concentration will be on other anomalous features on Mars’ andits satellite Phobos’ surfaces that are suggestive of an artificial origin.

Mars Global Surveyor Hexagons057 [images/00057.jpg] In this picture there are actually two hexagons visible, the large one towardthe center, and a smaller one towards the lower left hand corner. Some unknowngeological process might account for the rise of such structures, but if thatwere the case, how would one account for the apparent isolation of the unknowngeological process in this region, and for the fact that only two such hexagonsappear to have been formed?"},{"pageContent":"3. PYRAMIDAL AND OTHER RECTILINEAR FORMATIONS While giant hexagons and “airports” might be accounted for by some unknown andexotic geological process, four-sided pyramids possessing symmetry alongperpendicular axes is a whole other matter. A Martian Four-Sided Pyramid058 [images/00058.jpg] The Cydonia region, thanks to the efforts of Richard C Hoagland, Errol Torrun,Vincent DePietro, Mark Carlotto and so many others, is well known to be dottedwith a number of pyramidal formations, including the large and well-knownfive-sided D & M Pyramid. But the presence of such structures in other areas ofthe Martian surface strongly suggests that one is in the presence of a commoncultural matrix. The Sphinx-like Face, the Cydonia Pyramids and otherformations, and now another pyramid not in Cydonia, decreases considerably thelikelihood that the Cydonia formations are accidents of nature. Geologicalprocesses might explain large hexagons and large “airports”, but they will notadequately explain such formations, which are not known to occur in nature. Thisfact, along with the presence of such structures on the Earth, and the oddpresence of rectilinear and other regular surface features on the Moonsuggestive of artificiality, imply that we might be in the presence of a commonculture.Another odd feature found on Mars is the presence of depressions in its surfacethat, superficially, resemble craters, but which, on closer examination, revealthemselves to have a degraded rectangular structure underlying them. Again, thequestion inevitably arises of how would natural processes such as meteor impactsaccount for such features? Double Rectangular “Craters” on Mars059 [images/00059.jpg] An even more stunning example of a rectangular “crater” is the following.060 [images/00060.jpg] Again, what natural process would account for this?Another picture, released from Malin Space Systems, appears to be nothing but atypical region of Mars, with some non-descript geological features.061 [images/00061.jpg] But closer inspection will reveal a wealth of details about this “non-descript”formation that are quite anomalous. Note first that the bulge is almostperfectly circular. And note the zigzag rectilinear feature to the left on thetop of the bulge. On the right side of the bulge note again the straight linesthat form a “design” almost reminiscent of a seventeenth and eighteenth centuryVauban-style fortress. The “Bulge” with Zigzag lines and “Vauban” Style “Fortress062 [images/00062.jpg] This extremely interesting feature with all its anomalous characteristics mightbe accounted for by geological processes, to be sure, but if so, then it wouldappear that a number of discrete and very different processes would be at work,and in a most unusual combination. In short, natural causes might account forsome of these features, but for all of them to be present in one location, withsuch straight-lined regularity, would seem to stretch plausibility. The onlyother explanation is that these features are the creations of intelligence, andthat one is looking at degradations of structure that have occurred over time."},{"pageContent":"4. “THE MONOLITHS” One very difficult feature to explain by natural causes is a grouping of whatappears to be monoliths.

MORE DOUBLE CRATERING A feature found on the Moon is also found on Mars: “double cratering.” RichardHoagland, again, was the one who noticed this odd characteristic, and began towonder about a mechanism that could explain it. To see why, it is necessary toplace what he says in the context of his wider musings on craters.Craters themselves — whether double or not — are a significant geologicaltechnique for the dating of surface features on planets.> 1) Given that every other solid planetary body in the solar system has major> portions of its surface “saturated” with large (above 20 km) craters — Mars> has roughly one entire hemisphere (the southern) covered with such craters.> 2) Given that the central assumption for the creation of these> “shoulder-to-shoulder” craters is that there was a period of intense> bombardment very early in the history of the entire solar system — Mars’> heavily cratered terrain most probably dates from this “heavy bombardment> period’ as well.> 3) Given that the presence of these ancient crated terrains on the Moon,> Mercury, and the satellites of the outer planets...bespeaks preservation in> the airless vacuum of these objects’ surfaces — the preservation of similar> terrain on Mars argues forcefully for negligible erosion, most likely from the> lack of dense atmosphere for most of the lifetime of the planet.> 4) Given that the other hemisphere of Mars (the northern) matches similar> terrains on the Moon and Mercury, in terms of far less cratering — this> “two-faced” distribution of craters argues ...that there was a dramatic> drop-off in the rate of cratering for Mars, consistent with a solar> system-wide termination of “heavy bombardment” 4 billion years ago.627> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1186047] While Hoagland is here following the standard line that such cratering is due tothe early stages of the solar system and its presumed intense bombardment ofplanets by meteors, and therefore that he is following the standard model’sdating of such surface features with an age more or less concurrent with that ofthe planet’s formation some four billion years ago, Hoagland is quite alive toother possibilities of explanation, and therefore, for the formation of thesefeatures in much more recent times.628[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1186292]The presence within the southern, heavily-cratered hemisphere of Mars of manyapparent water-run off channels in the same terrain, however, indicated aproblem. For the standard theory, it indicated that Mars either had abundantwater very early in its planetary history, or that it was suddenly inundatedwith abundant water. Either way, this appeared to pose problems for the age ofMars. For one thing, it meant that water and atmosphere were stripped from Marsat a very early period, making the idea of intelligent life dwelling on thatplanet quite problematic. This, plus the anomalous “Face-Sphinx” and pyramidalstructures at Cydonia on Mars, which were of an apparently later date, was theproblem. How to reconcile the two conflicting data streams? Hoagland was thrustback upon the method of “dating by cratering,” and began to look at the VikingCydonia images from this point of view:> The area of the single Viking frame encompassing the objects - 35A72 — was> slightly less than a thousand miles in area. - a thousand times smaller than> the areas used for “crater counting” in the literature. Nonetheless, I decided> to apply this tried and true technique to this single Viking frame, for it> would give me some rough estimate of the numbers of craters in this region of> the planet — and thus a rough idea of the underlying landscape’s age...> And moments later I was presented with a paradox: there were “too many”> craters.> ....> (The) actual numbers of craters in the picture, exceeding a kilometer in size,> was three to five times the numbers in the published curves. This could be> explained by “clumping” (the numbers were a statistic fluke...), or they could> be real...> In which case, this region of Cydonia was among the oldest on the planet —> over 4 billion years in age! 629> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1186462] It is worth pausing for a moment to consider this possibility in the light ofwhat has been written previously here about the primordial nature of the revoltand cosmic war in the pantheon. If — and it must be emphasized that this is agigantic “if” — Cydonia and its artifacts were that old, then it wouldconstitute prima facie corroborative evidence of this primordial cosmic war.However, such an extreme date for all these Martian anomalies need not actuallyhave been the case. Van Flandern’s Exploded Planet Hypothesis in any of itsversions would also explain why there is such heavy cratering on Mars and muchmore aptly explain why it is limited to largely the southern hemisphere of thatplanet. It would similarly explain why Mars shows every sign of having beensuddenly and violently inundated with water. It would explain the run-offchannels and their presence in heavily crated areas quite easily. But this wouldplace the cratering dates at a much later 65,000,000 or 3,200,000 years ago.This is more acceptable, to be sure, in terms of the possibility of the presenceof life on Mars.Hoagland began to turn his attention to the phenomenon of double-cratering,i.e., twin craters of almost the exact same size and internal features, laid outin neat linear patterns. But there was another problem he noticed about many ofthe craters on Mars, whether double or not: many were too shallow to have beencaused by impacts. This, plus the evidence of strange damage to the admittedlyeroded “Face” and even stranger apparent damage to the massive five-sided D&MPyramid on Mars formed “one of the most disturbing observations” that Hoaglandmade, “that the objects at Cydonia exhibited considerably more than ‘naturaldegradation’ — for any reasonable age.”630[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1186645] And it all went backto Hoagland’s highly anomalous crater counts for the Cydonia Viking frame.This led him to pose the following significant question. This, and the responseof the scientist whom he consulted, is cited extensively below, for it is ofparamount importance as corroborative evidence of the Cosmic War Hypothesis:> Was it possible (I’d dared to ask myself, after the numbers consistently came> out too high), that the evidence of significant erosion on the Face and> pyramids - and the abnormally high number of 1-kilometer creators in the area> were a result of some powerful artificial agent...?> In other words, had life on Mars — the Roman “God of War” — been exterminated> in an all-out nuclear holocaust?!> The thought was too fantastic...yet, it could explain a lot of things ... the> craters... and the other evidence I’d seen; in examining the City under the> magnifying glass, I’d viewed direct evidence of melting and flow on the Main> Pyramid within the City.

PLASMA DISCHARGE, VALLES MARINERIS, AND STRANGE SUMERIAN MYTH But why call this war “cosmic,” inferring that it was of an interplanetarynature, and not simply a war fought just on Mars itself, by elements of thecivilization that was there? The answer, as seen in chapter two, lies in apeculiar “interdisciplinary” piece of evidence, that of the colossal gashingwound on the surface of Mars called the Valles Marineris: The Valles Mariners064 [images/00064.jpg] Reference has already been made of this unusual feature of Mars in chapter two,and to the fact that it fulfills geologically the ancient mythological archetypeof the “wounded warrior,” for in mythology and astrological lore, Mars — Nergal,Aries, Herakles in his Babylonian and Greek nomenclature — was certainly awarrior. A wounded warrior.After all the foregoing chapters, it should not now surprise us that there ispossibly very curious corroboration of this gashing wound from the ancientSumerian myth, the Lugal-E, which we have referred to previously in this work.To recapitulate what was previously said about the Lugal-E, it recounts therevolt of Azag against Ninurta, and Ninurta’s subsequent “inventory of thestones.” However, we now draw attention to some other features. In the myth,Azag is referred to as a “fearless warrior,”632[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1187058] a title withsuggestive connections to Mars as we have seen. But most curiously are theLugal-E’s identification of Azag, not with a person, but with a thing, an objectof incredible power, as the following passages indicate:> The Azag rose to attack In the front line of the battle.> The sky it pulled down as a weapon For its hip, took it in hand,> Into the earth it struck the head snakelike> ...It screamed wrathfully> Like a formidable serpent It hissed from among its people> It wiped up the waters in the highland Swept away the tamarisks,> It gashed the earth’s body.> Made painful wounds> ...> And till today black cinders are in the fields. 633> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1187296] If one take the statement about a gash made “in the earth’s body” as a referencenot to this specific planet, but rather simply to the ground beneath one’s feat,to a planetary frame of reference in general, then the depiction of Azag’s waragainst Ninurta in this passage fits remarkably well with the features on Marsrecounted by Hoagland and others.For example, the statement that the Azag “pulled down the sky” as a weapon, plusthe subsequent sentence that it intended it as a weapon for its “hip,” that itcould “take in hand” implies a sword. Azag’s weapon appears as a version ofZeus’ divine thunderbolt and Ninurta’s divine lightning discussed in chaptertwo. It sounds very much like the plasma discharges of Anthony Peratt. Thus, thegashing wound that it made, whose “black cinders are in the fields” up “tilltoday” is a reference to a gaping wound of planetary scale, a wound made by“lightning,” whose scorching effects are still visible. The Valles Marinerisfits the bill perfectly for a “wound in a warrior,” Mars, that is caused bylightning, or plasma discharge, which is still visible. This type of discharge,moreover, could easily be taken as “pulling down the sky” and striking like asword “into the earth” in a twisting, lightning bolt fashion, like a snake.The planetary context, in other words, of at least some parts of the Lugal-Ewould appear to fit better with events on Mars, than on Earth."},{"pageContent":"B. THE “FEAR” OF MARS: THE MOONLET PHOBOS AND ITS MONOLITH In this context of the Azag as a “thing”, and a context for some parts of theLugal-E taking place on Mars, the peculiar features of Mars’ little moonletPhobos should be considered. Phobos,634[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1187462] a name which in theGreek means “fear,” is an unusual object in its own right. Mars’Moonlet, Phobos065 [images/00065.jpg] Note carefully the large crater, barely visible in the above picture, which moreor less faces toward the right of the Moonlet, looking toward the surface ofMars. A close-up of this feature follows: Close-up of the Large Crater Feature on Phobos066 [images/00066.jpg] Careful scrutiny of this picture will reveal that the large crater ishexagonally shaped! Phobos’Peculiar Hexagon Crater067 [images/00067.jpg] This feature, plus the strange grooves running on the surface of the little moonjust beneath the hexagonal crater, suggest, once again, that there is more afooton Mars and its satellites than just natural geological processes. As we shallsee in the next chapter, the strangeness of this feature is magnified by thefact that there is almost an exact analogue of this feature on yet anothermoonlet, far far away from Phobos.The strangeness of this little moonlet does not end there. The following pictureof a small “tower”, its square shape and shadow clearly visible, is also fromPhobos. Small “Cylindrical Tower” on Phobos068 [images/00068.jpg] Additionally, Phobos also has its own gravitational anomalies that stronglysuggest that it, too, might be a “hollow” moonlet. Indeed, the Soviets were thefirst to suggest, as they did with Earth’s far larger Moon, that Mars’ littlesatellite might indeed be an artificial object in its entirety.And well they might, for Russian attempts to explore the Red Planet and Phoboshave met with some very disastrous results, the most extreme example of whichwas the apparent deliberate destruction of their Mars probe Phobos II on the25th of March, 1989. Just before transmissions from the probe suddenly ended, itsent back the following picture of the shadow of an object on the surface ofMars itself, an object that was in the vicinity of the moonlet Phobos. TheRussian probe also photographed a now famous picture of a long, thin,cylindrical object beneath the Martian moon shortly before all furthercommunication was permanently lost. Shadow of Cylindrical Object Cast on the Surface of Mars, Photographed by theRussian Phobos ll Probe, 25 March, 1989069 [images/00069.jpg] Photograph of Long Cylindrical Object Beneath the Martian Moon Phobos TakenBefore Transmissions Ceased, 25 March 1989070 [images/00070.jpg] Needless to say, the Soviet Union at first placed these photographs under thehighest security classification, then, for some reason, decided to share thesetwo pictures with the United States. This fact led some Russian scientists toconclude that Phobos itself was an artificial moon, and that their probe hasbeen deliberately attacked and neutralized by the cylindrical object that itphotographed just prior to the probe’s loss."},{"pageContent":"C. THE TWO SPACE PROGRAMS HYPOTHESIS"},{"pageContent":"1. THE OCCULT BASIS OF MISSIONS TIMING The presence of such anomalies on Mars, and the equally mysterious objects andstructures on - and around - its little moonlet Phobos, highlight the hypothesisof Two Space Programs, one a public one for show, and the other a deeply covertand hidden one, in no uncertain terms.In its most recent form, the Two Space Programs Hypothesis has been advanced bysuch luminaries as former astronaut, physicist, and PhD Brian O‘Leary, and ofcourse, Richard C. Hoagland. O’Leary maintains that the United States - andtherefore presumably anyone else with a space program — has maintained a hiddenmilitary program under the auspices of the US Air Force in conjunction withvarious intelligence agencies of the American government. This program has runat least since the inception of NASA, if not before, and oftentimes its missionsare wrapped within NASA missions, and sometimes its missions are run entirelyindependently of NASA. O’Leary maintains that this program has its own launchfacilities, vehicles, and its own corps of trained astronauts kept well awayfrom the public eye.In its Hoagland version, however, the Two Space Programs takes on an additionalaspect. Hoagland has often pointed out in interviews on radio shows, and invarious papers found on his website, that many space missions appear to be timedto take place when certain astrological conditions or alignments occur. He hasmarshaled over the years a vast body of evidence to suggest a strong prima faciecase that this is so. Additionally, Hoagland has also pointed out that the verynames of the space projects of the “golden years” of NASA — Projects Mercury,Gemini, and Apollo - are full of astrological and occult significance. Hoaglandand others have pointed to the existence of a variety of Masonic and esotericsymbolism in mission logos, and the heavy presence of Masons within theastronaut corps plus the performance of Masonic rites on the Moon as indicatinga hidden, covert or occulted aspect to the space program."},{"pageContent":"2. A COVERT MISSIONS OBJECTIVE: THE QUEST FOR AND RECOVERY OF PALEOPHYSICS ANDPALEOTECHNOLOGY This heavy Masonic presence, plus the astrological alignments of many spacemissions, does indeed suggest a covert and little known agenda behind the spaceprogram. Indeed, as author William Henry has observed, the quest for therecovery of ancient science and technology became> An essential feature of their secret society. In November 1752, when George> Washington became a Mason in Fredericksburg, he heard the following words:> “The proper business of a Mason is astronomical, chemical, geological and> moral science, and more particularly that of the ancients, with all the> mysteries and fables founded upon it.> “Let us endeavor to turn the stream, to go from priest-craft to science, from> mystery to knowledge, from allegory to real history.”635> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1187677] Weighed in the balance along with the Masonic presence in the early astronautcorps and the likelihood of an additional and hidden military program, it wouldthus appear that there is another aspect to the Two Space Programs Hypothesis,and that is a paleophysical one. It would appear that one goal of the spaceeffort is to “turn the stream” in precisely the Masonic sense alluded to above,to recover the ancient physics, and its associated technologies.If so, then the implications are staggering, for it means that from theinception of the space age, someone had already determined on the basis of thethen-existing evidence, that this evidence was sufficient to indicate that suchtechnology existed and by implication, that such wars were fought. It stands toreason, then, that any evidence supporting such conclusions in the public spherewould be either suppressed or tampered with.In short, the reason that NASA does not come clean with an admission of theartificial nature of Cydonia or of other Martian anomalies is not because theyare indicators of a former civilization there. It is rather because themythological context - the Cosmic War context - of those artifacts is alsoknown, and that context implies the possible existence of a science andtechnology that may be recoverable.A. HOAGLAND ON THE PALEOPHYSICS MESSAGE OF CYDONIA Hoagland and some of his closest associates have persistently hinted at suchpossibilities - though admittedly not in such starkly clear terms — with theirinsistence that the whole Cydonia complex embodies a geometry that encodes alost, “hyper-dimensional” physics. He does not mince words about the enormity ofthe physics he believes is embodied at Cydonia: it “involves nothing less, wenow believe, than the fundamental constructive energy of the Universe...whoseexistence - and accessibility — was apparently one of the prime reasons for thevery creation of the ‘ruins’ at Cydonia.”636[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1187869]In Hoagland’s view, the Cydonia complex is an encoded message of this physics, amessage that he also finds echoed in “ancient Egyptian temples and other‘sacred’ structures here on Earth.’”637[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1188079] But there might beanother functional reason for the geometries that Hoagland and his associatesfound at Cydonia beyond that of merely memorializing a “hyper-dimensional”physics. Hoagland himself hints at this function by his own suggestion that theregion was deliberately destroyed in a war. He himself points to the peculiardamage done to the D&M pyramid as the best example of this intentionaldestruction. So might it be that the geometries found at Cydonia are there, likethe geometries in the Great Pyramid, for some other, less benign purpose? Mightthe compound be, as I have argued in my Giza Death Star Trilogy, a vast militarycompound, and might the D&M pyramid be the Martian version of the Sumerian Azag,able to “pull down the skies” on its enemies? Might it be a kind of Martian“Rostau”?The answer to these questions is, I believe, a tentative yes.But whatever the answer to them is, Hoagland has done one significant thing inhis work, a significance few have appreciated. He has pointed out, for those whowould care to weigh what he has said carefully, that there is a common culturalmatrix, inclusive of common architectural forms, that is shared between Earth,and Mars. In short, he has given the Cosmic War of the Pantheon a planetarycontext from which to be viewed.638[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1188220]B. THE POSSIBLE LOCATIONS OF THE TABLETS OF DESTINIES BASED ON THE SCENARIO:GIZA, IRAQ, AND MARS The possibility that there is a hidden “paleophysics” component to the Two SpacePrograms Hypothesis now raises another significant question and possibility. Ashas been seen throughout this work, the “interplanetary context” of the CosmicWar Hypothesis involves the local space of our solar system, including theplanets Earth, Mars, and, as we have also seen, Saturn, Jupiter, and theirsatellites, and finally, the Sun itself.As was seen in chapter two, a physics sufficient to the task of tremendouslyscarring planets by means of plasma discharges does exist, and this physics inturn couples quite easily to an even more powerful physics - scalar physics - inwhich the planets and the Sun act as massive natural resonators of stresses inthe medium. And as we speculated in chapter eight, the Tablets of Destinies —the cause of that Cosmic War and one of the principal means by which it wasfought - were ultimately components in the technology that tapped thesetremendous resources. As noted in part two of this work, the components of theseTablets were inventoried, and some carted off and used elsewhere by the victorsin a kind of “paleoancient Operation Paperclip,” some were deliberately hiddenbecause of their potential destructive power, and because of the impossibilityof destroying them, and some components were permanently destroyed. All of thesefeatures of the story have the profound ring of truth, for precisely such eventstranspired after the end of World War Two, with the Allied inventory of the Naziwar machine’s arsenal of exotic technologies. Some of it was carted off to beused elsewhere in other applications, some of it was permanently destroyed andlost, and some of it was deliberately hidden because of its enormous potentialfor destruction. The parallels are amazing, and make the ancient myths ring ofan underlying truth.And the ancient myths, viewed against this interplanetary context provided bythe review of anomalous data from our nearby planetary neighbors, also allows usto reconstruct the general locations for some of these missing components. Aswas seen previously, the myths suggest quite obviously that modem day Iraq, andGiza or other “ancient sacred environs” in Egypt, are locations where thesecomponents might be found some day, buried beneath untold yards of sand anddirt. But another location must also surely be Mars, and possibly even the Moon.If the Two Space Programs Hypothesis is true, then perhaps this too forms one ofits hidden mission agendas.C. THE REMOTE VIEWING OF LOST TECHNOLOGY: IMPLICATIONS OF HURTAK AND THE FACE And this raises a last possibility.While the “Face” on Mars and all the attendant controversy surrounding it arewell known, it is not so well known that it was viewed before the Viking probefirst photographed the Cydonia region. Dr. James J. Hurtak, well-knownantiquities scholar and esotericist, claimed to have remote-viewed preciselysuch an object before the Viking probe ever reached Mars.While I remain personally skeptical of the spiritual influences and consequencesof such techniques, I do not doubt their actuality or even their accuracy. Thus,while it is possible that Hurtak was merely releasing information that had beenmade available to him, information that in turn was collected by technologicalmeans well in advance of its actual public release date, I am skeptical of thisexplanation, and tend to take Hurtak’s claims here at face value, since theywere published in a book before the Viking photos were ever taken, much lessmaking the rounds in the general public or becoming topics of magazine articlesand radio talk shows.Hurtak’s viewing of the Mars Face thus raises another disturbing possibility,one known to be in use presently by the various countries’ militaries and alsoby large corporations researching exotic technologies, and that is that suchtechnologies might be located via such processes. And it raises the possibilitythat such processes were being used to guide technological exploration of Marslong before probes were actually sent. If so, it casts another shadow on the TwoSpace Programs Hypothesis. It will only be a matter of time before someone,somewhere, attempts to use the same process to view and generally locate themissing components of the cause of that Cosmic War, the Tablets of Destinies.And after that, it will only be a matter of time..."},{"pageContent":"15.

Hoagland639[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1188678] It is perhaps only fair that the epigraph for this chapter be taken from aseries of papers - essays really - by Richard C. Hoagland, and posted on hiswebsite, for his thoughts on what he himself justifiably calls the “mostbaffling” and “the most important object” in the solar system,640[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1189028] including theCydonia Face and all the other anomalies on Mars and even on Earth’s Moon, willform the main focus of this penultimate chapter. Indeed, Mars’ tiny moonletPhobos, and the Earth’s own gigantic Moon, are not the only satellites toexhibit anomalies that betoken a possible artificial origin. The “most baffling”and “most important object” in question is Saturn’s “moon” Iapetus, and thereasons for the qualification of Iapetus as a “moon” will become abundantlyclear.Hoagland’s remark comes from a series of papers entitled A Moon With a View: Or,What Did Arthur Know, and When Did He Know It?, a subtitle that reflects thecurious fact that internationally-known and respected science fiction authorArthur C. Clarke first speculated on a catalogue of weird facts about one ofSaturn’s many satellites, and by any reckoning, its strangest. Clarke did so inhis well-known fictional work 2001: A Space Odyssey, a work that predated themany photographs that we will examine in this chapter by approximately threedecades. Hoagland’s work is entirely about Saturn’s “moon” Iapetus.We have already encountered in this book the peculiar association of Mars withSaturn in ancient mythology. However, it is an association extending far beyondthe astrological relationships usually conceived in this regard. The associationis, in fact, related to the Cosmic War itself, and to the role of Saturn in it.This role is best exhibited by a brief consideration of Saturn in Greekmythology."},{"pageContent":"A. SATURN IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY: THE WAR WITH THE TITANS Hoagland summarizes Saturn’s role in Greek mythology in the following fashion:> Iapetus...is the seventeenth of Saturn’s thirty three currently known moons,> and the third largest.

Herschel’s nomenclature for Iapetus and the other six> (then) known moons, was based on the logical association of Saturn (“Cronus”> (sic) in Greek) with the Titans; Herschel, continuing the ritual, named the> largest Saturnian moon “Titan” itself - in honor of the entire pantheon.641> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1189278]But Kronos (to give Saturn’s Greek name literal transliteration) was more thanjust the father of the Titans. In Greek mythology he was the “first god” priorto Zeus, and he was overthrown by a rebellion against him by the Titans, whowere, let it be noted, a race of giants.So in other words, the entire mythological conceptual matrix concerning Saturn -at least in Greek mythology - is precisely that of the ancient Cosmic War in thePantheon, a war which, in its Greek version, is clearly associated withrebellion and a race of physiologically large humanoids called Titans. AndIapetus is precisely one of these Titans. The Titans, rebelling against Kronos,eventually overthrow him, and in turn are overthrown by Zeus, who then becomesthe more familiar principle god in the Greek pantheon. One might thereforejustifiably amend the subtitle to Hoagland’s essay to include the more pertinentquestion of “What did the ancient Greeks know, and when did they know it?”Hoagland does eventually mention the connection of Saturn and Iapetus with thisancient cosmic civil war in the pantheon, but ultimately favors a very differenthypothesis, as we shall see. In my opinion, however, the mythological context ofthe War Against the Titans forms an essential backdrop from which to view theanomalies of Iapetus, and from which to weigh the various hypotheses Hoaglandadvances to explain them."},{"pageContent":"B. THE ANOMALOUS ORBITAL MECHANICS OF IAPETUS Like the Earth’s Moon, Saturn’s “moon” Iapetus has an orbit whose physicalmechanics makes it next to impossible that the “moon” was “captured” by Saturn’sgravitation as it wandered aimlessly through the solar system. And in the caseof Iapetus, it is an impossibility acknowledged by all that it did not “fission”and separate from Saturn early in the history of the formation of the giantringed planet. Ever since the astronomer Cassini first discovered the smallsatellite in 1671, its orbit around Saturn has been a mystery. Unlike all ofSaturn’s other known satellites, only Iapetus’ orbit is inclined some fifteendegrees from Saturn’s equator; the rest of Saturn’s satellites all orbit at theequator. And like the Earth’s moon, Saturn’s Iapetus also orbits Saturn, andrevolves on its own axis, in such a fashion that one of its hemispheres alwaysfaces Saturn, while the other does not.642[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1189562]But these are but the least peculiar features of Iapetus’ anomalous orbitalmechanics! It is best to cite Hoagland’s summary of the other strange featuresof its orbital mechanics in their entirety, to place his concluding remarks inthe wide physics context that his stunning concluding observation deserves:> Once the (amazing) possibility is admitted that lapetus could be an artificial> “moon” — and may have been deliberately inserted into such an odd orbit - the> “coincidental” nature of its unique, steep inclination (relative to the other> similar-sized Saturnian moons - Dione, Rhea, etc.) goes away.> But, equally “coincidental” is the shape of Iapetus’ inclined orbit...and its> precise distance from Saturn.> Iapetus’ orbit is extremely close to being circular — Shades of Earth’s Moon!> with an eccentricity of only 0.0283 departing from a perfect circle by> slightly less than 3%.

In other words, ifone advances the argument for the Moon having been artificially steered intoEarth orbit on the basis of its perfect circularity and the fact that itsorbital mechanics also show only one hemisphere to the Earth, then much more sois it the case for Iapetus and Saturn!> And, there’s more.> The sharp reader will have noticed, from the preceding references, that> Iapetus orbits slightly less than 60 radii away from Saturn (59.09) radii, to> be exact...).

ANOMALOUS SURFACE FEATURES OF LAPETUS"},{"pageContent":"1. THE “YIN-YANG” MOON Our exploration of the unusual features of lapetus - and we catalogue but a fewmentioned by Hoagland in his excellent series - begins with the fact that this“moon” has two distinctly different regions, a “dark” region, and a “white”region, that is, a region of high albedo and reflectivity, regions which are notmere artifacts of photography, but actually present on the small “planetoid.”Even more strangely, these regions are roughly interpenetrating ellipses, apattern that earned Iapetus the nickname the “Yin-Yang” Moon, after scientistssaw the following photo taken by the Cassini probe: Iapetus, the Yin-Yang Moon 647[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1190793]071 [images/00071.jpg] And there is another feature denoting artificiality, one that we haveencountered before, on Earth’s Moon, and again to an even greater degree, onMars and its little moonlet, Phobos: hexagonal cratering."},{"pageContent":"2.

A DARKLY SUGGESTIVE COINCIDENCE? IAPETUS’ “EQUATORIAL RIDGE” Another Cassini view of the Saturnian “moon” reveals an even more highlyirregular feature on a supposedly “natural” object: a ridge or “wall” runningthe entire length of Iapetus’ equator, in a straight line, a feature visible inthe previous picture just below the two large (and perceptibly hexagonal)craters, and thrown into even more stark relief in the following close-up. Iapetus’ Equatorial “Ridge” In Close Up.073 [images/00073.jpg] Again, close attention to this photograph will reveal two more features: (1) thehexagonal craters already previously mentioned, and (2) the fact that theequatorial “ridge” appears to be composed of three parallel components, a factthat will assume some importance subsequently. As for the ridge itself, it isestimated to be some six miles high, and of slightly greater width. Thisfeature, notes Hoagland, is “the greatest linear feature in the solar system,” afact that takes on some scientific urgency, because “there is no viablegeological model to explain a sixty thousand-foot-bigh,sixty-thousand-foot-wide, four million foot-long “wall”... spanning an entireplanetary bemisphere... let alone, located in the precise plane of itsequator!”650 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1191635] Andwhat about those three parallel lines that appear to make up the “ridge”?Hoagland minces no words: “It is a well-known cliché that ‘Nature doesn’tusually create straight lines.’ If that is true, then it certainly doesn’tcreate three of them... - all running parallel, not only to each other, but tothe literal equator of the planet.”651[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1191944]"},{"pageContent":"4. IAPETUS’ FLAT PLANE EDGES As if this were not enough, the Cassini photographs revealed that Iapetus is noteven a sphere at all, nor is it even a “squashed” sphere or ellipsoid. Thisfeature was captured in all its obvious, though anomalous glory by a Cassiniphotograph taken when the “moon” was light by reflected light from Saturn. Iapetus’ Straight Plane Edges652[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1192120]074 [images/00074.jpg] Another view of these straight edges may be seen from yet a different point ofview in a close-up photograph. Iapetus’ Straight Edges075 [images/00075.jpg] Looking at the horizon carefully, these straight edges are clearly visible onceagain. Iapetus is, on other words, not a sphere nor even an ellipsoid. Or asHoagland quips, “Needless to say - natural planets or satellites do NOT comewith sharply-defined ‘straight edges!’”653[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1192277] And these effectsare again not due to any photographic defect. To drive this point home, Hoaglandcites NASA’s own press release.654[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1192585]Whatever Iapetus may be, it is clearly not a moon, a natural satellite. It is anartificial body - of immense size to be sure — placed in an artificial orbitaround Saturn. Hoagland observes that the fact that NASA had the Cassini probetake over a hundred distant images of the “moon” indicated “that NASA alsostrongly suspected... what we’ve just discovered: that Iapetus, for some reason,is NOT a ‘spherical’ moon...In fact...that it’s not a ‘moon’ at all!”655[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1192726]But from the standpoint of this study and of the Cosmic War Hypothesis itadvances, Iapetus must surely be understood as corroborative evidence that theparticipants in that war, as indicated by the myths themselves, included Saturn,for now with Iapetus, we have clear evidence of a civilization, and of atechnology, sufficiently advanced to wage war of that destructive a nature. Thisdoes not, however, imply that Iapetus was a component in whatever dreadfularsenal was used, but merely that a technology once existed sufficient to thattask."},{"pageContent":"D. HOAGLAND’S THREE HYPOTHESES FOR EXPLAINING LAPETUS"},{"pageContent":"1. THE “ARK” HYPOTHESIS While any survey of Hoagland’s Moon With A View paper could not possibly do itjustice, no survey of the Iapetus anomalies that he so carefully catalogued inthe over two hundred pages of analysis in that paper would not be completewithout a brief mention of his own hypotheses for explaining the presence ofthis most extreme of all the anomalies in the solar system. Hoagland boils themain points of his argument for Iapetus’ artificial origins down to three basicfacts, or as he calls them, “exhibits”:> Exhibit #1: the baffling, highly geometric, precisely equatorial> ~60,000-foot-high “Iapetus Wall.”656> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1192902]> > > > > > Exhibit #2, the equally astonishing, equally unnatural rectilinear geometry -> evident all across the surface of this “moon.”657> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1193182]> > > Exhibit #3, without doubt our most astonishing Iapetus discovery - unique (so> far...) in the entire solar system:> That, instead of being spherical - as natural moons larger than about 250> miles across must be (due to inexorable gravitational contraction) - the> overall 900-mile-wide form of Iapetus is highly geometric... specifically,> apparently an eroded truncated isocahedron!658> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1193477]Viewing this planetary anomaly against the background of Van Flandern’s ExplodedPlanet Hypothesis, Hoagland advances his first hypothesis:> That, this extraordinary object was deliberately constructed as an “ark” — an> artificial, world-sized spacecraft, designed to rescue as many as possible> from the imminent, hyperdimensional explosion of an entire world, the> destruction of a former major member of the sun’s planetary system which now> no longer exists: Planet V.

THE “DEATH STAR” HYPOTHESIS Hoagland was not oblivious to this striking similarity, and in fact, capturedthe stunning nature of his next hypothesis in a very haunting visual comparison: Hoagland’s Iapetus-Death Star Comparison076 [images/00076.jpg] I have to confess that when I first saw this comparison on Hoagland’s website Iwas literally stunned. Even Hoagland had to ask an additional question at thispoint, not only wondering about what Arthur C. Clarke knew and when he knew it,but what Star Wars producer and director George Lucas knew, and when he knew it.As I have mentioned elsewhere,660[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1194145] there are a wholehost of parallels between the Star Wars “mythology” and that of the ancientmyths themselves. Even “Anaken Skywalker’s” first name is a rough assonance onthe Sumerian term “Anunnaki,” the beings who in Sumerian mythology came downfrom heaven and created mankind and subsequently taught him civilization.Hoagland puts the case for his second hypothesis, his “Death Star” hypothesis,this way: Iapetus> Was indeed a “Deathstar world” — created as an instrument of war by that same> civilization (which is still humans’ primary occupation, isn’t it?) - an> “instrument” then used in some unimaginable conflict in this solar system a> long, long time ago....> That Iapetus may somehow have even been instrumental in creating the almost> unimaginable holocaust — a literal “war in Heaven” — which ultimately resulted> in the deliberate destruction of that same doomed world ... with Iapetus> itself caught by the aftermath. As an eternal silent tomb, forever trapped now> in a permanent, unique orbit around Saturn....661> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1194334] At this juncture, Hoagland mentions his third, and most favored, hypothesis,dismissing the other two for their lack of sufficient explanatory power."},{"pageContent":"3. THE “TEMPLE” HYPOTHESIS This third hypothesis is that Iapetus was designed as a kind of “temple world”and placed in its precise orbital positioning to model, and “sacralize” various“hyper-dimensional” physics and mathematics. In short, it is the geometriespresent on Iapetus and in its orbital mechanics that the “rescue ark” and“deathstar” hypotheses cannot explain.662[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1194641]There is much to commend this last hypothesis, including something that Hoaglanddoes not mention, though it is clearly implied from his extensive remarksthroughout his paper, and it was surely in his mind when he proposed thishypothesis, and that is that the “Temple Hypothesis” would certainly square withthe type of religious world-view evident in the ancient myths we have examinedin this book, and with the preoccupation of Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and later,Graeco-Roman civilizations to build temples embodying precisely suchmathematical relationships. This, the “Ark Hypothesis” cannot do.But I am bold to suggest that his “Deathstar” hypothesis can account for thesegeometries, for as has been repeatedly argued not only here but in my previousbooks, any weapons system based on scalar physics would seek to embody as manygeometric analogues of local celestial systems and their mechanics into itsstructure as possible, in order to make it the most efficient resonator of thoselocal space-time geometries. One would come to expect such redundancies, andsuch orbital mechanics, for they would serve a functional purpose for theweapons system. Similarly, as we have also pointed out in this book, such aphysics can also be made the basis, in one and the same system, for a powerfulinterstellar communications network. So yet another possibility is that Iapetusmay form some component or “base of operations” in such a network.Moreover, Hoagland’s “Deathstar” hypothesis shares something in common with his“Temple Hypothesis” and that is that there is a mythological context in which itmakes perfect sense: the war of the Titans, the giants of old, to overthrow the“first god” Kronos, Saturn. This fact, coupled with the fact observed earlier inthis book that Saturn is often, for some reason lost to history, portrayed inconjunction with Mars, the god of war. Viewed in this light, Hoagland perhapsmay have abandoned his “Deathstar” hypothesis too quickly.In any case, our examination of the extra-terrestrial evidence for an ancientinterplanetary civilization and war is now complete.

Thus,Cremo and Thompson’s work has the happy benefit of providing its readers with averitable catalogue of “pre-evolutionary” evidence, widely reported in theliterature of the day, that subsequently was forgotten, or worse, hushed up. Inany case, they outline a substantial case that mankind is indeed of far greaterantiquity than modern standard models will countenance.For the Cosmic War Hypothesis, however, the antiquity of mankind is a given.What must be explained, rather, is the level of cultural achievement of this“paleoancient man,” or lack of it, for as we have already seen, the WarHypothesis demands that at some point between 3,200,000 and 65,000,000 yearsago, there existed a sufficiently advanced culture - human or otherwise — inorder to wage the war, if one accepts the dates of Van Flandern’s ExplodedPlanet Hypothesis as chronological benchmarks. This problem is acknowledged byCremo and Thompson themselves in no uncertain terms, even though they mostdecidedly are not concerned with any version of the Cosmic War Hypothesis.> Up to this point, most of the evidence we have considered gives the impression> that even if humans did exist in the distant past, they remained at a somewhat> primitive level of cultural and technological achievement.

THE AIX-EN-PROVENCE FIND One such discovery that Cremo and Thompson relate is the discovery made byFrench laborers from 1786 to 1788 in Aix-en-Provence, and recounted by the CountBournon. Having dug to a depth of fifty feet through solid limestone, theworkers then came upon a chamber, in which they discovered tools, hammers,coins, and other standard mason’s equipment. Some of the stones found in thechamber had already been worked. The American Journal of Science in 1820 citedthe Count Bournon’s concluding words concerning the implications of thisdiscovery: “The presence of man had then preceded the formation of this stone,and that very considerably since he was already arrived at such a degree ofcivilization that the arts were known to him, and that he wrought the stone andformed columns out of it.”669[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1196057]"},{"pageContent":"2. FINDS REPORTED IN AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS In 1831, The American Journal of Science was at it again, reporting thediscovery of raised characters on a block of marble taken from a quarry nearPhiladelphia, from a depth of 60-70 feet. The characters once again suggested anorigin by humans who had worked the stone in the distant past.8As no evolutionary college of cardinals existed at the time to suppressarcheological Galileos making inconvenient discoveries, even a prestigiousjournal such as Scientific American could get in on the act. In its June 5, 1852issue, the journal ran an account of a discovery of truly “paleoancient”proportions:> A few days ago a powerful blast was made in the rock at Meeting House Hill, in> Dorchester, a few rods south of Rev.

THE SMITHSONIAN’S 200,000 YEAR OLD COIN Another strange find was reported in 1871 by William E. Dubois of theSmithsonian Institution. One of these was a small copper coin covered withstrange markings and an unidentifiable figure. The coin was retrieved by a mandrilling a well from a depth of 125 feet, through 3 feet of soil, “10 feet ofyellow clay; 44 feet of blue clay; 4 feet of clay, sand, and gravel; 19 feet ofpurple clay; 10 feet of brown hard pan; 8.5 feet of green clay; 2 feet ofvegetable mould; 2.5 feet of yellow clay; 2 feet of yellow hard pan; and 20.5feet of mixed clay.”673[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1197169] The Illinois StateGeological Survey’s estimates for the age of deposits at the 114 foot level wasthat they were formed at the “Yarmouthian Interglacial ‘sometime between 200,000and 400,000 years ago.’”674[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1197377] This is intriguing,because it corresponds with the same approximate time frame given in theSumerian Kings List of the arrival on Earth of the Anunnaki, and the time thatthey allegedly reigned on Earth prior to the Flood: 241,200 years.But there were other interesting things about the coin than its age. Duboisnoted that the coin was polygonal, its inscriptions were in no recognizablelanguage, and most importantly, since it was of uniform thickness, Duboisconcluded that it must have “passed through a rolling-mill...”675[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1197518] This flies squarelyin the face of standard models in any number of ways, from the existence of suchtechnology, to the fact that Homo sapiens sapiens is not believed to have lived“much earlier than 100,000 years ago,” to the fact that metal coins were thoughtto be used only after the eighth century BC in Asia Minor.676[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1197668] 400,000-200,000 Year Old Coin from Illinois: the Writing is not from any knownancient language 677 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1197809]077 [images/00077.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"4. THE NAMPA FIGURINE, AND TECHNOLOGY IN THE COAL Another anomalous find was discovered in 1889 at Nampa, Idaho at a depth of 300feet, again from a well-boring. The figurine is an anatomically correctdepiction of the modern human form, of a female, and of very refined artistictechnique. The figurine is only approximately 1 ½ inches tall, making therefinement of the artistic technique it displays the more remarkable. The stratafrom which the little female figure came dates from the Plio-Pleistocene age,making it approximately 2,000,000 years old!Another remarkably old object was discovered by an Illinois housewife as she wasbreaking up coal to place in her coal scuttle. On breaking up one lump, shediscovered a gold chain of apparently antique design was partially embedded inone of the fragments. After the woman’s death the chain could not be traced, butthe layer of coal from which it allegedly came made the chain between 260-320million years old.678[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1197959] A similar incidentoccurred in Oklahoma, when an iron pot was discovered embedded in coal that hadbeen broken up.

FOOTPRINTS OF A PALEOANCIENT CIVILIZATION Two enormously anomalous discoveries were made in the American Southwest. OnOctober 8, 1992 the “American Weekly” section of the New York Sunday Americancarried an article entitled “Mystery of the Petrified ‘Shoe Sole’ 5,000,000Years Old.” The article was by Dr. W.H. Ballou, who reported a discovery by thegeologist John Reid, who was digging for fossils in Nevada. Much to hissurprise, Reid discovered a very strange “fossil” indeed, that of the sole printof a shoe in rock that was at least 5,000,000 years old!680[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1198317] But five millionyears proved to be far to late a date for the print, since the rock on which itwas found was from the Triassic period, usually dated to some 213-248 millionyears ago. 213-248 Million Year Old Shoe Sole Print from Nevada 681[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1198525]078 [images/00078.jpg] Another very controversial find is the so-called Meistner shoeprint, discoveredin 1968 in Utah by William J. Meister, an amateur fossil hunter and collector.This shoeprint was found in Cambrian shale near the town of Antelope Spring,Utah. The print occurs in rock that is over 505 million years old. Of course, asCremo and Thompson point out, the find was quickly dismissed, as scientistsclosed ranks and came up with a variety of sound bites attacking “creationists”and “flat earthers,” even after one evolutionary biologist admitted he had notactually seen the print firsthand himself. While this is not the place to surveythe controversy surrounding this incredible print,682[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1198666] Cremo and Thompsonadmit that the case remains ambiguous, but unlike the dogmatists in theuniversity science faculties, they “suggest... that the resources of empiricalinvestigation have not yet been exhausted and that the Meistner print is worthyof further research.“683[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1198874] The Meistner Shoe Print: If Genuine, this Fossilized Shoe Print would be over505 Million Years Old684[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1199082]079 [images/00079.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"6. ARTIFACTS THAT ARE PRODUCTS OF TECHNOLOGY In 1968 Y. Druet and H. Salfati stated that they had found semi-ovoid metallictubes “of identical shape but varying size in Cretaceous chalk” in a quarry nearSaint-Jean de Livet in France. This would made the mysterious tubes, the obviousproducts of a technology, at least 65,000,000 years old. The significance of thedate, by now, should be obvious, for it is the date of Van Flandern’s firstplanetary explosion.An even more anomalous find occurred when curious metallic spheres were found ina mine in Ottosdal in the Transvaal in South Africa. According to Roelf Marx,“curator of the museum of Klerksdorp, South Africa, where some of the spheresare housed,” the metallic spheres “are a complete mystery. They look man-made,yet at the time in Earth’s history when they came to rest in this rock nointelligent life existed.”685[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1199232] Sketch of 65,000,000 Year Old Metallic Tubes Found in Chalk in France 686[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1199440]080 [images/00080.jpg] Two of these little balls show features we’ve encountered before. One of them, ametallic sphere, was discovered in a layer of Precambrian deposits, making itsome 2.8 billion — that’s billion with a “b” — years old!

Mightwe be looking, for example, at a child’s set of toy models? While we willprobably never know the answer to that or similar questions, the fact remainsthat the resemblance is there.But more importantly, the fact that these little spheres even exist is yetanother piece of evidence that someone intelligent, possibly human, possiblynot, was on this planet a very very long time ago indeed."},{"pageContent":"C. SOME RADICAL SPECULATIONS COURTESY OF THE COOPER-CANTWHEEEL MAJIC-12DOCUMENTS"},{"pageContent":"1. HUMAN ORIGINS AND THE “CELESTIAL EXTENT” OF HUMANITY OR ITS GENUS This short review of Cremo and Thompson’s massive catalogue of evidences for thegreat antiquity of mankind has indicated that someone of intelligence was onEarth during the time periods hypothesized for the great Cosmic War. Moreover,the dispersion of this evidence, from North America to Europe to South Africa,slight as this account of evidence reviewed here is, tends to support the viewthat this paleoancient civilization was at least fairly well-dispersed over thesurface of the planet. And the great antiquity of some of these anomalousdiscoveries also suggests an answer to Lyell’s question that began our review ofCremo and Thompson’s evidences. Lyell, as was seen, asked why there was notevidence of a great, advanced, lost civilization. And the answer that Cremo andThompson’s own catalogue of anomalies seems to suggest is, that there is solittle because that civilization was of such extreme antiquity that very littleevidence is likely to remain, and if it does, it lies buried beneath hundreds offeet of geological strata. To put it succinctly, we merely haven’t dug deepenough.These evidences also raise another equally if not more important question: Whowas present on Earth that long ago? The answer of many of the ancientmythologies would be that the “sons of heaven” or the “Anunnaki” or the “b’naiElohim, ” the “sons of God,” were.However, a slightly different - though not ultimately contradictory — answer issuggested by a most unusual source. Readers of my books on World War Two Nazisecret weapons research, Reich of the Black Sun and The SS Brotherhood of theBell, will recall that I analyzed the so-called Cooper-Cantwheel series of theMAJIC-12 or MAJESTIC-12 documents. One of those documents, which will be ourfocus here, was called the “Project White Hot Intelligence Estimate(Preliminary).” This document is divided into three sections, the first sectiondealing with the crash and recovery of bodies at the celebrated Roswell crash,the second section being a “Technical Evaluation(Preliminary)”, and the thirdsection entitled “Scientific Probabilities.”689[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1200032]It is part three that interests us here. I will cite the portion of this sectionof the document that concerns us at length to show the context, italicizingthose portions of the document that provide a radical answer to our question,“Who was here that long ago?”> 1. Based on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currently> under study by AMC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, ONR, NACA, JRDB, RAND, USAAF, SAG, and> MIT, are deemed extraterrestrial in nature.

While mostpeople rush to see in these documents a confirmation of the extraterrestrialhypothesis, what they miss are the implications of these two highly significantstatements, for if the document is genuine - and assuming for the sake ofargument that it is - then it means that the recovered bodies were sosufficiently like us that they are referred to as “human,” and thus the documentraises the question that the document itself addresses: that the genus withinwhich homo sapiens sapiens fits may, and evidently does, exist on other planets.And thus one is led to point 6 in the document, and to its astonishingconclusion: “The laws of physics and genetics may have a genesis in a higher,structured order (than) once previously thought.” What the document is in factsuggesting here is a degree of scientific sophistication - apparently suggestedto the experts examining the recovered components and bodies from the crash —that displays a union of physics and biology in a higher theoretical order. Thisis exactly the same sort of thing that was implied by the clues upon which wespeculated on what really constituted the Tablets of Destinies. That is, thatevolutionary processes that lead to the development of particular kinds ofintelligent life - recall that comment about the human “genus” in point 5 —might be derivable from the same sort of formally explicit laws that thephysical technology of the recovered craft suggests.Now this is interesting, because it flies in the face of the physics technologythat is actually described in the document, which, as I point out in Reich ofthe Black Sun and in The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, is simply insufficient toindicate a craft capable of interplanetary, much less interstellar, travel. Infact, as I argue in those books, the technology surveyed in the Cooper-CantwheelMAJIC-12 documents sounds all too human and terrestrial, indeed, it sounds onlymodestly more advanced than the technology of the late 1940s, when this“advanced craft” crashed!So in other words, these conclusions in points 5 and 6 exceed the stated scopeof the evidence cited internally in the document itself, and this implies thatsomething about the technology that was omitted from the document suggested tothe technical analysts involved in the recovery that they were dealing withsomething paradoxically both humanly terrestrial and humanly extraterrestrial.In any case, the document makes the astonishing suggestion that humanity or atleast its “genus” may possibly be found on a multitude of worlds and may not belimited to our own solar system."},{"pageContent":"2. THE TWO SPACE PROGRAMS HYPOTHESIS AND SCIENTIFIC SUPPRESSION These speculations return us once again to the idea of two space programs, acovert and an overt one. Many researchers who have studied the phenomena ofanomalous and artificial artifacts on other planets, such as Richard Hoagland,Mark Carlotto, and others have often commented on the fact that NASA and otheragencies are apparently covering up, or tampering with or otherwise altering thepublicly available data and photographs. Others, such as Lt. Col. Tom Bearden,or physicists Tom Vallone or Paul LaViolette, have noted a similar cover-up inplace in the suppression of alternative energy inventions or theoretical papers.And, in this chapter, we have encountered evidences of the antiquity of mankind(or of “whomever” as I have indicated in the chapter title) which is ignored ordeliberately forgotten and suppressed by the scientific community.We thus have the following areas in which a cover-up, tampering, or suppressionof the evidence is visible, or at least suggested:> 1. A cover-up of anomalies indicating intelligent design on other planets> within our solar system, which may extend to a cover-up of data concerning the> actual geology, geography, and physics of celestial bodies. Moreover, this> cover-up may extend to the concealment of the true purpose of space programs,> which may be to recover whatever ancient advanced technology as may be found> on nearby celestial bodies;> 2. A cover-up of alternative conceptions and technologies in physics since at> least the early nineteenth century, which may lead both to greater energy> efficiency, and to weapons of horrendous power;> 3. A cover-up of anomalous data concerning the great antiquity of mankind, or> of “whomever,” on Earth, and of the apparent technological sophistication that> was achieved, a cover-up usually made in aid of defending the theory of> evolution. In fact the real motivation for doing so may not lie in defending> the leaky theory of evolution, but diverting attention from the possibility> that very advanced ancient technologies may exist. Moreover, this cover-up may> be due - as the MAJIC-12 documents suggest - to the fact that “insiders”> possess information suggesting that human origins are interplanetary in> nature. If one looks at this list of possibilities and speculations, then it is clearthat the Cosmic War Hypothesis touches on each of the three main areas. This inturn suggests that the Cosmic War Hypothesis itself may be one of the hiddenmotivations for each of the three areas of cover-up. After all, if there wassuch a war, it implies a celestial extent to humanity, or “whomever,” and asophistication of technology and a potential for destruction that we canscarcely imagine. If one adds into that volatile mix the clear indications ofour most ancient myths, that there was also an ancient and preternaturallymalign intelligence behind the most primordial revolt, then it is a frighteningscenario indeed."},{"pageContent":"17.

As to (the words) ‘that night of the battle,’ they concern the> inroad (of the children of impotent revolt) into the eastern part of heaven,> whereupon there arose a battle in heaven and in all the earth. ” The Egyptian Book of the Dead, Spell XVII692[The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1200595] This book has outlined the prima facie case for a paleoancient Cosmic War withinour own solar system, a case based in part on modern science, on ancient texts,and on the peculiar interface that seems to exist between the two, allowingreconstructions of an ancient paleophysics from suggestive passages in thosetexts.For purposes of the chronological benchmarks of that war, Dr. Tom Van Flandern’stwo exploded planet events at 65,000,000 and 3,200,000 years ago were viewed asthe benchmarks around which to fasten the events of the wars in the pantheonalluded to in the Mesopotamian texts examined here. As was also seen, the3,200,000 year benchmark had textual and mythological corroboration both fromthe Vedic tradition of the great “yugas” and from the Sumerian Kings List.A physics sufficient to the task of significantly scarring a planet surface wasfound in the plasma physics of Alfvén and Peratt, and the latter’s corroboratingevidence of petroglyphs was found to support human observation of massive plasmadischarges and instabilities in very ancient times, though certainly not withinthe timeframe suggested by Van Flandern’s Exploded Planet Hypothesis in itsoriginal or revised versions. Moreover, as we saw, this physics would adequatelyexplain the resemblance of Mars to the mythical motif of the “scarred warrior,”with its distinct large planetary feature of the Valles Marineris, whichstrongly suggests formation via a large electrostatic discharge. Its almoststraight nature also suggests that this discharge was intelligently manipulatedand steered - targeted would be a better word — across the surface of thatplanet.This plasma physics in turn suggested disturbing ties to the wartime Nazi “Bell”project, as was seen, and also indicated deeper connections to scalar physics, aphysics that, in the hands of Paul LaViolette’s exposition of pulsars, could bemade to form a galactic communications grid, and could be made of sufficientpower to explode a planet in a deliberate act of war, an act strongly suggestedby the Enuma Elish and other Mesopotamian legends.The exploded planet, of which Van Flandern believes Mars was once a satellite,was a large planet, of similar mass to Saturn, and very possibly solid and waterbearing. And that implied in turn that it may have been home to intelligentlife, life that we speculated was humanoid in nature, but of much largerphysiology to accommodate the greater gravity. Ancient myths from the Sumerianto the Greek to the Biblical traditions also record a race of giants that camefrom the heavens, and revolted against their gods or God, and fought a prolongedand destructive war. In the Sumerian and Biblical traditions, these giantcreatures also intermarried with humans, and produced giant offspring.Corroborative evidence of the existence of extraordinarily large human giantswas presented both from ancient and more modern times as a very loosecorroboration both of the ancient legends, and of the speculation offeredconcerning the large inhabitants of that exploded and now missing planet.The ancient Mesopotamian texts also make it clear that the war was fought over,and by means of, a hegemony-conferring technology called the Tablets ofDestinies, a technology found to be paralleled in some Egyptian legends such asthe Edfu building texts, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and in legendssurrounding the disappearance of Thoth’s emerald or sapphire tablets. TheseTablets were apparently connected to the stones of power, inventoried by Ninurtaprior to the destruction of some, the preservation and the secreting-away ofothers. In this, the inventory of the stones resembles nothing so much as thepost-World War Two behavior of the Allied powers inside of vanquished Germany,and lends the ancient myths an air of authenticity, as if they are dimlyremembered historical events.These Tablets of Destinies, as was also seen after careful examination of thecomplex of mythological symbols associated with them, were speculated to be theindexes of interferometric “gratings,” the necessary targeting information orsoftware, to be plugged into the hardware of a devastatingly power scalar weaponof mass destruction, whatever that weapon may have been.The textual traditions and mythological symbols examined also pointed to certaincombatants in this Cosmic War: the now missing and exploded planet, plus Mars,Saturn, the Moon of Earth, and the Earth itself. Corroborative evidence of theexistence of artifacts of intelligent design was presented, from anomalousfeatures on our own Moon, to the familiar, and not-so-familiar, anomalies on thesurface of Mars, to the bold hypothesis of Richard C. Hoagland that Saturn’smoon Iapetus itself appears to be one gigantic artificial satellite.The Cosmic War Hypothesis also requires the presence of intelligent observers ofthe events described, not only on those planets, but on the Earth itself. Inthis respect evidence was presented from Cremo and Thompson’s voluminous work onsuppressed archaeological discoveries that suggest that modern man is of muchgreater antiquity than standard evolutionary biological, paleontological, andanthropological models will allow. Evidence was presented that someoneintelligent, of human-like characteristics, existed on the Earth many millionsof years ago, and in time frames that fell within the benchmarks of VanFlandern’s Exploded Planet Hypothesis.All this is to say, of course, that I believe that the Cosmic War Hypothesis hasbeen made an adequate prima facie case, if not, perhaps, the best one that couldhave been made.But in addition to all this, there are, of course, disturbing possibilities, andwe have mentioned some of them throughout this work. But there are more, of the“what if” variety.The Tablets of Destinies, and their counterparts, the Tablets of Thoth, wereinextricably tied to Mesopotamia, and to Egypt. And, via the “Mountains ≈Celestial Bodies ≈ gods ≈ Pyramids” formula, they are inextricably tied to theartificial mountains - the pyramids and ziggurats - of those areas. We havespeculated in this work, therefore, that perhaps some of their remainingcomponents lie secreted beneath the sands and silts of the ages of those places.And this point raises those disturbing possibilities, possibilities thatsomeone, somewhere, may be looking for them. I hinted at these possibilitiesonly obliquely when I wrote in my book, The Giza Death Star, the followingpassage:> From the 19th and on into the 20th centuries until the outbreak of (World War> Two), American and German scholars poured over Near Eastern archaeological> sites with a view to but one thing: proving their pedigree and connection with> those ancient societies. It was the first outbreak of the “culture war,”> expressed in a kind of social imperialism as the ascendant Anglo-American> culture and the ascending German culture each laid claim to a vaunted ancient> pedigree. For the Anglo-Americans, the lineage ran from Egypt, to Greece,> Rome, Britain, and finally to America. For the Germans, the lineage ran from> Atlantis, to Sumer, to India, and finally to Germany. 693> [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_175.html#filepos1200874] The search was, however, doomed so long as it was conceived as a search for trueorigins between Egypt and Sumer, as if the two cultures are opposed andunrelated entities. On the contrary, as we have seen, there is ample evidence tosuggest that they each preserved, in their own ways within their own myths, anolder stratum of histories about the Cosmic War, and the technologies with whichit was fought.But search nevertheless they did. And no nation more assiduously than didGermany, for Germany was the home, in that day, of some of the most renowned andfamous Sumerologists and Assyriologists in the world. German orientophiliaexpressed itself popularly with translations of Mesopotamian myths into German.It is possible then, that during the crazed inter-war years of the WeimarRepublic, with its numerous secret societies stressing an ancient super-racefrom which the Germans allegedly descended, that this expressed itself in theform of an organized effort to seek and recover those lost technologies. And inthe milieu of the Third Reich, and Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler’s SS “occultand ancestral research bureau,” the notorious Ahnenerbedienst, the bureaucraticclimate would certainly have existed for the type paleophysics interpretation ofancient texts as has been undertaken here. This would have led to a profound,and very secretive, German presence in what is now...Iraq.Nazi interest in that country, then under strong British influence, dates backto the 1920s when the National Socialist party was still in its infancy. Notsurprisingly, one finds the character of Detlef Schmude - a main player in theNazi party’s secret society backer, the infamous Thule Gesellschaft, a member aswell in Von Liebenfels’ Order of the New Templars (ONT) and an editor of theThule Society’s magazine Ostara - settling in Tabriz, in neighboring Persia.There he based his next few years’ search for the “Hidden Masters.” Someone ofSchmude’s importance and position within these groups suggests that he was thepoint man for gathering facts and information for them.Then, in 1939 Admiral Wilhelm Canaris’ Abwehrabteilung, Germany’s militaryintelligence, dispatched Dr. Paul Leverkühn to the Middle East to cultivateallies among the Muslim populations under British rule or influence. Hisheadquarters was also Tabriz, in Persia. But most interestingly, his mosthighly-placed recruit was none other than pro-Nazi Iraqi Prime Minister RashidAli, overthrown two years later by the British invasion of Iraq.Canaris’ network of Abwehr agents inside of Iraq was taken over by Himmler in1944, after Canaris’ implication in the Bomb Plot against Hitler in July of thatyear. Strangely enough, Himmler placed these agents under the control of noneother than Baron Rudolf Von Sebottendorff, one of the principal founders of theThule Gesellschaft to begin with and, like Schmude, a member of Von Liebenfels’Order of the New Templars! This implies that the real basis of Nazi networks inIraq was grounded in the secret society network in the region, perhaps initiatedby Schmude.Yet another connection that must be mentioned is “Himmler’s Rasputin,” KarlMaria Willigut, a.k.a. Weisthor. In 1940 Willigut brought several archaeologicaldiscoveries that indicated man’s presence in Iraq’s Irbil province as far backas 10,000 B.C.What happened to this Thule-SS network in Iraq after 1945 no one knows, however,it is interesting to note that Von Sebottendorff’s body was found floating inthe Bosporus in Istanbul in 1945, after the war’s end.This, plus the fact that both Germany and France gave great archaeologicalassistance to Saddam Hussein’s regime, and the fact that there is now an armedAmerican and British presence in the country, strongly suggests that anotheragenda may have been at work besides the prevention of Hussein’s acquisition ofweapons of mass destruction or the spread of terrorism. Indeed, perhaps everyonewas in search of weapons of mass destruction of a very different and much moreancient sort!Then there is the peculiar behavior of the Egyptian government, building a wallaround Giza...Finally, there is America’s recent announcement that it intended to go back tothe Moon, and on to Mars, with manned space missions. The announcement cameafter a series of manned space flights by Red China, as if to say that Americaintended to continue its “monopoly” of those two planets, and of whatever mightbe on them.It is as if the wickedness and evil of contemporary men of might, cloaked intheir agencies of power, prestige, and privilege, were secretly groping andreaching out, with all the might and dark technological sophistication thatmodern man can muster, for that diabolical stone of exile, for the tablets thatonce conferred and may yet confer again to their possessors an almost universalmastery.Caveat lector!"},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHY Acheson, Mel and Amy. “Thunderbolts of the Gods: Does Growing Evidence of anElectric Universe Reveal Previously Hidden Meaning in Ancient Mythology?”,Forbidden History: Prehistoric Technologies, Extraterrestrial Intervention, andthe Suppressed Origins of Civilization.

I personally believe that there are other explanations forJupiter’s excess heat. I mention Van Flandern’s explanation to highlight theexplanatory power of the Exploded Planet Hypothesis. Hoagland believes, however,that since all the planets of the outer solar system exhibit an anomalous excessenergy outflow, that the cause must lie in something else, and here I believe heis correct in ascribing the source of this outflow to “hyperdimensional” sourcesof energy.33 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_011.html#filepos72649]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, pp. 156- 157,emphasis added.34 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_011.html#filepos73345]Ibid., p. 223.35 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_011.html#filepos73587]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, p. 224.36 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_011.html#filepos74118]Ibid., p. 227.37 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_011.html#filepos74236]Ibid., p. 226.38 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos77909]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, p. 235, emphasisadded.39 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos79664]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, pp. 235- 236,emphasis added. I have highlighted the radiometric and polonium problems becauseother alternative researchers have often pointed to problems in the technique ofradiometric dating. It is perhaps possible, in his revised Exploded PlanetHypothesis, that Van Flandern may have abandoned this possibility rather tooquickly. But as will be seen, the formulation of the revised theory was basednot only on the need to resolve this chronological discrepancy, but also on theneed to account for new classes of evidence.40 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos80935]I have added this explanatory phrase to Van Flandern’s text, to avoid anyconfusion that might result from his use of the abbreviation 65 Ma.41 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos82189]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, p. 403, emphasisadded.42 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos83685]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, p. 405.43 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos86436]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, p. 407.44 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos86644]Ibid.,45 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos87561]Ibid, p. 408, emphasis added.46 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos87962]It might be the case that these formed a double-planetary system such as that ofthe Earth-Moon system, but this would seem to pose further difficulties ofcelestial mechanics.47 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos90431]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, pp. 411- 412,emphasis added.48 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos90927]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, pp. 427- 428.49 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos91096]See my Giza Death Star Deployed, pp. 15-18.50 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_012.html#filepos91538]Van Flandern, op. cit., p. 432. Obviously, C would have had to have beensufficiently large, at least as large as Mars, in order to retain water. Thewater may have been original to both satellites - Mars and C - or may have beendeposited on them by the explosion of V, or some combination of both.51 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_013.html#filepos92539]Ibid, p. 407.52 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_013.html#filepos93632]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, p. 427.53 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_013.html#filepos94994]Ibid, p. 435.

Van Flandernmeans the 65,000,000 years’ event. I have stated it in this ambiguous fashion inorder to leave open the possibility that it may have been the 3,200,000 yearsevent. As previously noted, Mars during this time could have been home toabundant water, suggesting that it might have procured some or all of this waterfrom the 65,000,000 years’ event, or that the 3,200,000 years’ event was notlarge enough to sweep all of its water away in the shock wave of the explosion.55 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_013.html#filepos95818]Ibid.56 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_013.html#filepos98196]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, p. 233.57 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_013.html#filepos99436]Ibid, p. 233.58 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_013.html#filepos100389]See, for example, Paul LaViolette, Subquantum Kinetics, pp. 62-65, for adiscussion of the matter-antimatter symmetry problem.59 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_013.html#filepos100995]Van Flandern, op. cit., p. 233.60 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_013.html#filepos104502]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, p. 232.61 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_013.html#filepos105936]Van Flandern, Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, p. 226.62 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_014.html#filepos107335]Mel and Amy Acheson, “Thunderbolts of the Gods: Does Growing Evidence of anElectric Universe Reveal Previously Hidden Meaning in Ancient Mythology?” inForbidden History: Prehistoric Technologies, Extraterrestrial Intervention, andthe Suppressed Origins of Civilization, ed.

Such attempts may provide an adequatetheoretical foundation to bridge this gap physically, but they still do notdispense with the textual component of the problem, for as LaViolette and othershave noted, there is ample paleographical and textual evidence to suggest thatthe a sophisticated physics might once have been in existence in paleoancienttimes.

The phenomenon is not, however, as mysterious as it would firstappear to be, for one of the implications of scalar physics is the ability of anobject, under the right geometrical configuration, to structure the localpotential of the medium. This would include the “inventor” himself as acomponent, in some circumstances, of this geometry. When the invention is moved,or operated by someone else, it loses this local structuring of the potential.This is a phenomenon dealt with at some length by Bearden in various papers.379 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_057.html#filepos474674]The text cited is from Hans Gustav Gunterbock, trans., “The Song of Ullikummi:Revised Text of the Hittite version of a Hurrian Myth,” Oriental Institute(University of Chicago, New Haven, CT: The American Schools of OrientalResearch, 1952).380 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_057.html#filepos478923]“This child”, i.e., Ullikummi381 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_057.html#filepos482982]David Hatcher Childress, Lost Cities of Ancient Lemuria and the Pacific, p.382 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_057.html#filepos490479]Most likely a reference to Baal.383 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_059.html#filepos521539]http://earth-history.com/Sumer/sumer-sumer-kinglist.htm[http://earth-history.com/Sumer/sumer-sumer-kinglist.htm] Emphasis added.384 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_059.html#filepos524648]R.A.

Might Hussein’s alleged“weapons of mass destruction” have been the code for something more than justchemical, biological, or nuclear weapons? We will never know for sure, but it isperhaps illuminating to recall the “Baghdad Museum Incident” shortly after thecity was captured by American forces. Several priceless ancient artifacts, withsome ancient texts presumably among them, disappeared for a period of a fewdays, and then were suddenly “recovered” and restored to the museum, giving thethieves enough time, perhaps, to copy or take pictures of whatever items theyhad stolen, or to substitute other items in their place which were subsequentlyrecovered and returned.437 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_069.html#filepos613693]R.A.

The major difference between the German experimentsand the modem one is that the German radars were not cohered.473 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_079.html#filepos672164]LaViolette, The Talk of the Galaxy, p. 132.474 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_079.html#filepos675788]LaViolette, The Talk of the Galaxy, 132-134, emphasis in the original.475 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_080.html#filepos677037]Bearden makes the following extremely disturbing remarks which provide thehistorical basis to LaViolette’s Mark II microwave version of this technology:“One should also realize that the Soviets discovered time-reversed (TR) EM wavesright after World War II. In the latter 60’s and early 70’s, to theirastonishment, Western scientists found time-reversed EM Waves emerging in theopen Soviet nonlinear optics literature. In 1972, two Soviet scientists briefedU.S. scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on nonlinear opticalphase conjugate waves.“At the end of World War II, the Soviets discovered four-wave mixing and pumpedphase conjugate mirror effects in the German radar team’s anomalous radarexperiments with multibeam illumination of radar absorbing material (RAM).Specifically, in multibeam illumination of RAM materials, one gets four-wavemixing and amplified phase conjugate replica effects. The phase conjugatereplica, of course, is a time-reversed EM wave. Further, in four-wave mixing,this time-reversed EM wave can be amplified. Thus anomalous, amplified,time-reversed radar waves would have been encountered in the radar team’sexperiments. The Soviets obtained the entire German radar team - RAM materials,multibeam illumination anomalies and all - at the end of the war. In decipheringthese anomalies, the Soviets and their German protégés discovered time-reversedEM waves, phase conjugate replicas, pumped phase conjugate mirrors, andmultiwave mixing effects. And they first discovered them in radar waves -microwaves - not in optical waves.” (Bearden, Gravitobiology, pp. 26- 27,emphasis in the original).As I noted, however, in my last book, The SS Brotherhood of the Bell, I believethat the ascription of this discovery to the Soviets by Bearden is erroneous. Ibelieve the Germans were looking for these effects, found them, and knew fullwell what the physics implications were. While Bearden credits the invention ofthe whole vocabulary of scalar or quantum potential physics to the Soviets,since it first appears there in their open physics literature, I believe thelikelihood to be that the concepts and terms were first invented during the warby the Nazis to explain the anomalous effects they were observing in termsideologically acceptable to the occult- and anti-relativistically obsessed SSthat oversaw all such secret research in Nazi Germany.

Otherearly Christian authors such as the Apologists or, even better, Origen,speculated that angels had a kind of material existence, but one that was “lessdense”, i.e., closer to the original materia prima from which they and the restof creation were created. To put this metaphysical conception in slightlydifferent, more “physics and mathematics related” terms, such beings were closerin terms of their “topological descent” from this materia prima than more“material” - or to use the terms of this earliest period of metaphysicalspeculation, more “gross” - creatures such as humans.It is interesting to note that, in the Patristic Christian and as well as theearly mediaeval Latin traditions, angels inhabit a kind of “hyperdimensional”realm, as “created everlastings,” i.e., as creatures having a temporalbeginning, but no end. In this sort of timeless existence, so closely tied tothe transmutative aether, there is no distinction between an act of the will andthe formation of its habit, a condition that does apply to humans. Thus, angels,on this view, acquire a habit or “impressed dynamic” simultaneously with thefirst exercise of their will, for good or ill. Extending this line of reasoning,this impressed dynamic conceivably impresses itself in turn on objects that theyencounter.580 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_104.html#filepos833330]David Cohen, “Plasma Blobs Hint at New Form of Life,” New Scientist, 17September, 2003.581 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_104.html#filepos834366]Another obvious implication of such a life form would be that it would becapable of inhabiting worlds not thought to be habitable by human-like life.582 [The_Cosmic_W-_Ancient_Texts_split_106.html#filepos835979]Q.v.
